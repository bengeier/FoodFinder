{"text":"i've been to a few Kinton locations, I think the original is still the best! i've tried a number of the broths and enjoyed them all. a satisfying, filling bowl of soupy goodness!"}
{"text":"It's a small space that's cool and bright.  Great cool casual style.  Seating for three is a bit tight there but that's part of the look, bring skinny friends.  We had the vegetarian ramen and it was tasty.  Good variety of topping, the noodles had a nice texture, and broth was flavourful without being too salty (ie I did not feel guilty about drinking the soup.).  My only criticism of the menu is that I'd appreciate more vegetarian or vegan choices.  For example, they had a lunchtime combo which started with pork or chicken broth (why not veggie)?  And perhaps a couple more veggie apps to choose from beyond edamame and what's not already in the vegetarian ramen.  Service was prompt, friendly, and enthusiastic.    Would go back for my local ramen fix."}
{"text":"All the Kinton Ramen hype spamming my facebook feed made me desperate to try this place, but sadly I left Kinton unsatisfied and annoyed.   The restaurant itself is warm and homey...perfect to prepare anyone for noodles and soup. As you enter, the whole restaurant greets you and as people leave, they do they same thing. Overall a really happy Japanese atmosphere.   **Make sure your whole party is ready or else they won't seat you (understandable considering their limited seating capacity).   The spicy chicken app was my favorite and something I would come back for. It was soooooooooo good. The ramen was definitely authentic but it's also overhyped. (It's not something I would wait outside in line for). I like that you can choose the meat and broth to help watch the waistline. If you finish your bowl (with the soup), they'll reward you with a prize and ask to post your photo on facebook as part of their \"Bowlers\" club.   Service is fantastic when it comes to the food but the limited English the servers understand made my night painful. We ended up waiting an hour to fix a mess up with bills and waited 20 minutes for a refund. I understand that the chefs are pure Japanese for authenticity  of the food but why can't there be bilingual staff to help run things more smoothly? I was annoyed and begging to leave the restaurant by the time the mix up finally panned out.   I don't think I'll come back to Kinton... maybe for that chicken... but only maybe."}
{"text":"Pulled the loner samurai thing tonight and walked into this place by myself looking for comfort noodles to help take the edge off the day. I certainly got what I came for.  The place is small and it was packed with people when I arrived, but the benefits of lonerism allowed me to get seated right away -- squished next to a couple of dreadfully boring U of T students on a presumed date.   The vegetarian shoyu ramen I ordered came right away. Nice! Time to enjoy this in solitude! I was a little disappointed that there wasn't more food volume, but the veggies were diverse and fresh, plus I had ordered a side of perfectly cooked short-grain white rice for only $1 with the combo. The broth especially was fantastic and I actually had to take some notes (they have ingredients included on their menu).   Besides the boring dentistry students seated behind me, the experience was great. It's a little bit pricey for a lunch option, but worked well for a memorable, mindful, dinner.   Then I strode off into the night."}
{"text":"Best : Spicy broth with Pork shoulder.  I've tried the traditonal broth...a little bland for my liking.  Heed the warnings on busy periods...the wait can be long.  All in all a great, fun place to eat."}
{"text":"this is the best and authentic japanese ramen place in toronto. there could be better ramen elsewhere, but in toronto, this is the best.  can someone just remove the kimchi out of the menu... that's not japanese!"}
{"text":"3.5. we had a group of 5 and all ordered Garlic Spicy Ramen! wait time was 30 min on Saturday afternoon. this place is really popular.   the noodle was decent and soup was very flavourable, it does get very spicy after a while. very oily though.   a big disappointment for one of our party was that they don't do refill on noodles, you need to order the extra when you order the ramen. it doesn't even make sense to us, both from customer and the store's perspective..."}
{"text":"Their staff are very authentic and enthusiastic! I tried their vegetarian noodles and I got a very large bowl. Personally, I think their noodles are a bit too heavy on flavor (salty) and would have preferred if they watered it down a bit. Great place to visit if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"Ever since I started watching Naruto, Ramen has always been a craving of mine. This place fulfills that craving tenfold. I'm a Kinton Bowler. Great food and very enthusiastic servers and chefs. My first time there I was so excited I screamed back a nice and loud \"THANK YOU\" after their welcome greeting.  Aside from the people, the food is great. My blood pressure might be a little endangered but that is honestly eclipsed by how well they prepared and how nice they presented the yummy Ramen."}
{"text":"Boyfriend and I went in on Halloween recently for lunch. There was still a line up even after 2:30!! We waited for about 20 minutes for a seat to open up and got promptly served by the waitresses. For drinks Jon got a mug of Sapporo and I ordered their \"Halloween Special\" which was a mixture of homemade lemonade and juice. I ordered the Shio Ramen with Pork Shoulder and my bf got the Miso Ramen with Pork Shoulder as well. The ramen was fresh and the pork shoulder was DELICIOUS! Highly recommend getting pork shoulder as it is a little bit meatier compared to pork butt. My drink was delicious as well but i twas 7 bucks and wasn't even alcoholic!   Would go again, once the hype has died down."}
{"text":"Went to Kinton Ramen on Friday for lunch. We waited 45 minutes for our ramen to arrive, this is a ridiculous waiting time and the staff did not offer any apologies (I would give 2 stars for the service). However, I still give it a 4 stars overall because the ramen was good, and I can see a potential for this new ramen place but I think it just needs time to train the staff and all. As for the ramen itself, the broth was flavourful and the pork meat was delicious. However the noodles were too soft (like wayyyy too soft)! But again I think they just need more time to practice and hopefully they will have improved services and make consistent and great ramen bowls."}
{"text":"Great ramen place, I love the way all the staff greet you when you come in and say good bye when you leave. The food was really good but not the best and prices were on par with other restaurants in the area.   Service - All the staff were very friendly and full of energy,  they all had big smiles on their faces.  They often circled around to make sure our food was good and our drinks were filled.   Food - I tried the original pork thick ramen and the spicy thick pork ramen. Both broths felt a little pain, lacking the salty flavor that I've come to expect from ramen dishes. However the meat in both the dishes was delicious. It was the rich fatty part of the pork and we got a good portion of meat to soup ratio.  The noodles had some firmness to it, again not what I've come to expect but I think I like the firm al dente texture.   The original soup was really lacking on flavor, it's still a good filling dish but it just lacks that punch. The spicy soup has a bit more flavor and is great for the first few bites. However near the end of the dish the garlic becomes overpowering and takes away from the taste.   I also tried the pork gyoza,it was great. Crispy shell with juicy pork flavor on the inside, they gave 4 slices and its good to share half and half with another person.   Ambiance - This is a great casual place to go with friends or family, it's loud but welcoming. Every few minutes the staff would all greet the customers. It's one of the bigger ramen places i've seen around so it can seat larger groups."}
{"text":"Service is horrible! Ramen (well, the garlic soup) is great, but I wouldn't go there again and wait in line for an hour and a half for a bowl of their noodles with a side of bad service."}
{"text":"Ever since the decline of Ajisen Ramen, this neighbourhood was ripe for a new, trendy Ramen place.  I was uber excited when I find out that Kinton Ramen was opening up a location there. After all, I would go at least once a month to the Baldwin location. A Kinton Ramen that was a couple of blocks down the road. What more could I ask for?  A lot.  I came in on a Friday, right before the dinner crowd showed up so it was empty. I was with a couple of friends. It looked like a Kinton Ramen shop, but something was off. The atmosphere didn't seem too cheery.  I sat down and looked at the menu. The first shock reverberated through me. They don't have the veggie Ramen! In fact, none of the Kinton Ramen stores do. They took it off the menu a while ago. It was quite the blow to me. It was one of the few places in Toronto to get veggie Ramen, and now that was gone.   So I ordered the cold ramen salad, since it was vegetarian. Boy, that was a mistake. It was inedible. The flavors were just off. It was salty and sour, but I didn't feel good eating it. It felt like I was eating lemons dipped in soy sauce. Blech.  I got some takoyaki and that was fine. But it's hard to screw up takoyaki.  After that, I didn't feel like ordering more. It was all a huge letdown. It didn't help that everything was rather expensive, and the portions were much smaller from when the first Kinton opened up.  Sad to say that, Kinton got McDonald-fied. It's not \"cool\" anymore. I will be looking for another restaurant that wills serve the rare and fabled veggie Ramen."}
{"text":"This is our go-to ramen place - it never disappoints. It's a small place so there's usually line. Its perfect for 2 people, but I've gone with 4 and it was not a problem - just a bit of a longer wait.   The ramen portions are large and I've tried them all. They're all great, depending on what you like.   My favourite is the spicy garlic - the minced garlic is provided in a ball on top and I usually remove some of it as it is very garlicky if you mix it all in. I'd say the spice level is medium, but feels like it gets spicier after ever slurp.  I also like the Shoyu when I don't feel like having something spicy and I always get the rich soup.  The gyoza is also very good.  I prefer it as an appetizer over their fried chicken.  The ambiance is loud and fun and the service is always good."}
{"text":"Tried Kinton Ramen for the first time today. Waited 45 min. for a table for 3 before we were seated, which was absolutely ridiculous.  After a long torturous wait, we were finally seated and luckily by the window so I was able to have my personal space while eating.   Food was delicious. I ordered an Original Karage for appetizer, and Shoyu Ramen. The karage was beautifully fried and had an abundance of flavor. The ramen was pretty good compared to most places in Toronto, but not the best I've had -- and especially not worth it when I factor in the stupidly long lineup I had to endure to be seated!  Overall, I enjoyed the meal itself but considering the fact that I have similar, if not better, places closer to me, less cramped, and lineup-free, I would not come back here even if I were in the area just because of the ridiculous wait time."}
{"text":"I had the opportunity to try Kinton this weekend, and went to Kenzo down the street (okay, a long way down the street) today to compare.  Here's my finding.    Broth - Kenzo: clean, fresh and lightly. Slightly saly, but I like it that way. Kinton: very fatty, lumps of fat floating around, very strong \"pork bone\" taste. Nice flavour, but very fatty tasting. and doesn't have that clean fresh tast of Kenzo's. Much less salty than Kenzo. Broth Score: Kenzo 4, Kinton 2.5  Noodles: Kenzo's are nicely chewy and fresh tasting. Kinton's are close but taste a bit more \"packaged\". Noodles Score: Kenzo 4, Kinton 3  Egg: Both delicious but I prefer the saltiness of Kenzo's: Egg Score: Kenzo 5, Kinton 4  Chai Siu: Kenzo's is \"okay\" but tastes more like Chinese pork. The Kinton pork shoulder (and Pete's pork belly) were moist, soft and delicious, with thick cuts of meat and very generous portions.  Meat Score - Kenzo 3, Kinton 4.5  Extras: Kinton's nori accompinament is a nice touch. Kenzo's bok choi (or was it gai lan, I don't remember) and smushed ginger add a nice bit of flavour. Draw.  Overall - I favour Kenzo by a fairly wide margin, mostly on account of the broth. I just found myself very full after eating at Kinton, due no doubt to the fact that it felt like I had just eaten a cup of melted lard. Too fatty for me. But I can see it as being a matter of taste."}
{"text":"It was a cold rainy weekend evening when I headed off to try Kinton Ramen. As expected, there was a large line up. We decided to brave the line and waited for a good while outside in the cold rain. Overall it was worth the wait. While I do not count myself as a ramen connoisseur (does such a thing exist?), dinner here was a thoroughly enjoyable experience.   The restaurant has a nice decor and the atmosphere was great, especially on a cold rainy fall evening. Staff are friendly - the random Japanese yelling reminds me of Guu Izakaya. I have no idea what they were saying.   Food wise: Spicy Karaage - generous portions. Delicious spicy fried chicken. I definitely enjoyed this app and it went well with the ramen Spicy Garlic Ramen - I ordered this with extra pork shoulder. I'll admit I have a pretty big appetite but I could not finish all the pork. I ramen comes with a friendly heaping of garlic. I love garlic. The broth was delicious. The ramen was not too soft. In the future, I'd probably add an egg to the mix.   Overall, this joint is a good addition to Baldwin with solid options. Definitely worth a try in the increasingly crowded downtown ramen market."}
{"text":"Great service and great food!!! Really energetic, the whole vibe of the restaurant is really nice!"}
{"text":"this restaurant is terrible, I ordered Shoyu Ramen and it was extremely salty that I couldn't finish the bowl. The waitress is also kinda rude, didn't ask whether I have finished my appetiter and just took the plate away....feeling terrible!!"}
{"text":"Overrated! We went to Kinton at around 6PM with a 15 minute wait. We ordered the hot karaage, shoyu ramen and spicy garlic ramen.  The noodles, pork shoulder, and egg was cooked pretty well. The broth was more substantial than that of momofuku's, but not totally amazing either. The hot karaage was pretty disappointing. The flavours were not too pleasing and the chicken was more soggy than anything.   For the price it was okay, however I doubt I'd come back here anytime soon. Something about my meal left me extremely nauseous afterwards!"}
{"text":"With so many ramen places popping up around Toronto, Kinton wouldn't be my first choice for a hot bowl of noodles. However, it has a pretty convenient location and the lineups aren't too bad. Also, sitting at the bar where you can watch the chefs do their work can be really entertaining!  Aside from your typical ramen bowls, Kinton offers a few unique choices: Garlic Spicy Ramen - personally, I think this is their best dish. It's got just the right amount of kick and the garlic isn't overpowering. I would get this again if I come back. Cheese Ramen - waayyy too heavy for my liking. I think you would have to REALLY love processed cheese to be able to enjoy this one. Saladamen - my vegetarian friend ordered this off a \"special menu\" and although it comes with no soup, it has strawberry slices and an egg.  We couldn't finish a bowl and asked if we could pack it up to bring home. Incredibly, they charged us $0.50 for a plastic container."}
{"text":"It's OK.  Full disclosure. I don't get the Ramen craze in Toronto.  I like Ramen but I refuse to wait in line for it. These places charge top dollar for a bowl of noodles. It is after all a bowl of noodles. I like it. But there are a lot of places doing it and mist are really very similar.   Nothing special about this place. Service is OK at best. We've been treated stupidly as a group a couple of times.   When the fad is over I doubt these guys will be the last ones standing."}
{"text":"After a 60 minute wait on a Saturday night, we were seated in front of the open kitchen. The staff were all dressed and quite entertaining. The atmosphere in the restaurant was phenomenal, with the wait staff along with kitchen staff chanting in Japanese in enthusiastic vigor. This was a sight to see.   We ordered spicy garlic ramen bowl along with shoyu ramen. With our seating, we got to watch the chefs while we sipped on smooth Sapporro.   Before long, our soup dish arrived and we dug into our meal. The ramen noodle was al dente and the broth was not too rich (to our liking). The shoulder pork piece was nicely cooked and charbroiled with a flamegun. The portion size was huge: we only managed to make a dent. For a dollar, we got our leftovers in containers to take home.  Overall, awesome food in a vibrant atmosphere with quality service."}
{"text":"The place was packed and the service was good. Got the Miso Ramen with pork shoulder and rich soup. The soup was excellent with rich, fatty taste and strong aroma. If you prefer a rich broth that goes with the noodle then this is your shop. the noodle however is lacklustre. it's not chewy at all, the pork shoulder are so so, it's not that tasty but it's not bad. Overall the shop is nice but nothing special."}
{"text":"I ordered the pork thick noodle ramen, with the miso base. I have to admit, the pork was absolutely delicious, although it was a bit daunting for me to take a bite out of what looked like a big chunk of fat. The broth was okay, although a bit salty. I definitely had to down another water bottle after lunch. The noodles were fine, and I felt satisfied with the meal. The atmosphere was great, and I may go back there again with friends!"}
{"text":"Definitely one of the better places to get ramen.  Price alone is awesome, flavours are pretty similar to when I was in Japan and most of all they're completely customizable. I adore their spiced/seasoned eggs and I also get an extra. The staff are great and energetic, and the atmosphere of the cooks working together leaves you happy and intrigued. I've been here enough to fill more than one bowler card and everyone I've ever taken here really enjoys it.   Friends or dates, you can't go wrong.  Unless of course they don't like broth or noodles. But if you find someone that doesn't like ramen I definitely say run.  100% this is my home away from home.  For those saying they want vegetarian or vegan options this isn't for you. These guys do it like they do back home which is in a bone broth."}
{"text":"Food was good, very trendy atmosphere, only two pieces of meat or tofu in a big bowl of soup. I found it a bit on the pricey side."}
{"text":"Certainly not worth the hype that seems to be lavished on it, but it's a solid bowl of ramen. The slight charred flavour from the torched pork belly adds a lot of depth to the somewhat bland soup base.   The spicy garlic is my pick of the broths, just make sure you allow the minced garlic a little time to steep in the broth and mellow out slightly before you dig in. The noodles are cooked nicely, and the bean sprouts add a nice refreshing crunch.   For the price, it's a decent option for a quick meal, so long as you go at off peak hours."}
{"text":"I recently saw this place on the Food Network's You Gotta Eat Here and #1, thought it looked good and appetizing and #2, thought it would be a good place to take my brother visiting from the UK.  We stopped by to check it our the other night. As North York/Toronto has turned its back on its rich history to build mindless condos everywhere we remembered that the restaurant used to be one of the last record stores in North York.   We waited in line app 15-20 mins before a table was available. Not a problem as it was entertaining watching what the others were eating.    Their website sucks as if you want to see the regular items in North York you cant click on it as there is nothing there and get a \"404 Page Not Found\" message. You can however see the regular menu if you pick another restaurant. The \"Special Menu\" shows items that look good but are not available when you are actually on site. Clean it up Kinton!  Once seated, we ordered drinks and food. We ordered the Edamame and the Original Karaage chicken (very good) with the Takoyaki octopus balls (also very good). We also ordered the Kimuchi (kimchi) that was also very kimchi good.  For Mains, I had the Pork Miso Ramen with the thin noodles and mu brother had the  Spicy Chicken Ramen with the thin noodles. the food was very nice  The wait staff was quite attentive and with the line up at the door asked if it was ok to give us the bill the minute we put our chopsticks down.   The food, ambience and staff were very good and in agreement with the Food Network....  You Gotta Eat Here !"}
{"text":"my favorite ramen place! the staff is great, very welcoming and helpful with picking something from the menu!"}
{"text":"The only negative experience of this restaurant was the wait to get in since they have limited seating if you're going in with 4 people. If youre just going in as 1 or 2 people its pretty quick, though.  Menu is awesome and customizable for the dishes, which I loved.   Can choose your level of fatty-ness, and customize your whole order, simply, with meat type, broth type, noodle thickness, additions, etc.  Or you can simply choose a pre-made selection from their menu, too!"}
{"text":"went here Sunday lunch, good ambience, but seats are not comfortable, appetizers are great though BUT the ramen took sooooo long to come!  more than 20 minutes!  dont come here at a busy time esp if you are hungry!  pls improve your service!"}
{"text":"Im not a big ramen person but i was craving today so i went by myself and ended up finishing it! i usually dont :) , miso pork ramen is my go to favorite. i wasn't disappointed here, except the seats are not comfortable at all.. staff were friendly , music a bit loud but didnt bother me..  the gyoza was good too.  good ramen place overall.. Ajisen ramen is also a good one but i liked it here better.."}
{"text":"First time at Kinton Ramen -- I decided to go here with my friend because it's authentic ramen compared to other ramen places I've been too. So far, the reputation of Kinton is in the mark - authentic Japanese ramen from broth to noodles to toppings.   I ordered a cold ramen dish, which is a new addition to their menu and it did not disappoint! Absolutely amazing in flavour and the portion was just right. I was a bit disappointed that there was only one piece of chicken but it is so filling that I'm glad I didn't have to eat any more food than I can handle.   The atmosphere is great, but a bit too loud with the music. It is also a bit claustrophobic  because it's a small ramen shop, but aside from that it's a very nice, friendly place. A definite go to place with a couple of friends for a bite to eat! If you don't mind the yelling and loud music, I definitely recommend going to Kinton for authentic ramen, it's an experience worth having."}
{"text":"Food is delicious and great customer service. There broth is awesome and I could literally eat it all day"}
{"text":"I've been here more than 10 times already. I personally lovee the shio ramen. I've tried the cheese ramen and spicy ramen. The cheese ramen had too much cheese which made me dislike miso ramen. The spicy garlic had too much garlic, so if I were to order spicy garlic, I will probably ask for no garlic. I usually order shio ramen with regular soup base and pork belly. I have yet to try shoyu. Overall, the service was great and the food was great. I would definitely recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"I couldn't wait to try this place. The images I saw here made the food look so tantalizing and to my pleasure it looked just as good if not better in person.  Let me begin with the positives. Both meat options-pork belly and shoulder-were beautifully cooked. The flavour was nice, texture was tender and portions were just right. My partner's belly was \"porky\" in a good way, said my dining partner and I thoroughly enjoyed my shoulder. The noodles were perfectly al dente-you need some firmness in noodles to give the dish texture. You don't want mushy noodles. The gyozas were also nicely done and stuffed to the brim with decently seasoned meat and fried to crispiness.  However, there was also much with which to be disappointed. The broth-the most important aspect of ramen-was neither delicate nor flavourful! The spicy garlic was nevertheless spicy and garlicky but lacked any kind of depth. Once your taste buds get over the initial impact of spice, it doesn't go anywhere. The shoyu ramen was quite heavy-handed on the shoyu and there was a burnt taste that was imparted from the blow-torched pork. Yes, they blow torch the meat rather than grill it, unfortunately. So it was difficult to get over the salty burnt flavour of the soup which I didn't bother to finish. Our ramen came to us a little on the warm side. I would prefer if it came to me hotter than that.  Overall, kinda disappointed. If it weren't for a nicely poached egg, decent meat and nice noodles, it would've garnered fewer stars. They've got the fundamentals but lacking the depth. Atmosphere was fantastic-good music, vibe and service."}
{"text":"my friend dragged me here to eat the \"best ramen in Toronto\" but all i got was disgustingly soft noodles and a piece of some old japanese man's leather shoe cleverly disguised as a slice of pork. the whole time i had to listen to a bunch of drunk white guys sprout off bad japanese at the waitresses. if you actually like kinton ramen then you're probably the same type of person who unironically goes to starbucks."}
{"text":"Taste wise, not as good as other locations. Price wise , the chicken karaage is expensive than other location. Overall, not recommend. If you go to downtown regularly, do try the other locations."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE wish I could give less than one star!  A bunch of hacks who know nothing about food or hosting.  If you want horrible service and horrible ramen with pubic HAIRS in it then GO Run to this place. We got here around 10 Pm on a Saturday night thinking nothing of it as the sign said they were open until whenever on Friday and Saturday. Well we got the distinct feeling that our group of three wasn't welcome. They sat us and ignored us for a good 10 min. We almost walked out until the rude waitress came over us telling us we were holding people up from going home (even though the place was packed with other customers) and that we needed to order now. We  tried to order drinks and they told us we could not have alcohol, when we pointed out other patrons with large glasses of Sapporo she pretended not to understand our English and told us we needed to order now or leave. Really regret not leaving at that point but we wanted to try it. We all got ramen and shared a tofu app. The tofu came fast and was delicious. When our ramen came it was ice cold. We all thought it tasted down right horrible. It would be one thing if it was just bland but this was Inedible almost rotten. None of us could take more than two bites and left our meals almost 100% intact when we left.  what comes to mind is the smell of a compost bin. These people clearly know nothing about true ramen and are just jumping on the bandwagon of actual talented people and amazing restaurants.  They got the atmosphere right, the décor right, the menus are almost identical, but they missed the most important part THE FOOD. Ramen houses and izakayas are also know for their HOSPITALITY not at this place.  Pricy too around 68 for 3 bowls of ramen one app. We would have demanded our money back but honestly our time is worth more. We cut our losses and moved on to owl of Minerva The kicker was that mine came with 5 short black curly HAIRS in it. Nice eh?"}
{"text":"The ramen competition in Toronto has really ramped up over the last few years, so we're getting tons of great ramen options now. Maybe that's the reason why my visit to this Kinton didn't really faze me.   We came here on a Saturday evening before the dinner rush and were seated within 5 minutes. We ordered: - spicy jalapeno chicken ramen (regular broth with thick noodle and pork belly): broth was good and the spicy level was just right - original pork ramen (rich broth with thick noodle and pork belly): the rich broth was my boyfriend's choice so I wasn't a huge fan of the big chunks of fat floating in the broth and the egg was overcooked  - hot karaage: pretty good but eat it quickly - if you let it sit, the spicy sauce will make the chicken soggy  Overall, I thought the food was not bad, but I felt the ramen flavour lacked depth."}
{"text":"Casual ramen place that is certainly ideal for a quick ramen fix! Chic and trendy atmosphere with energetic staff. Had the original pork ramen and added sweet corn for $1. Pork broth was extremely tasty with good portions of pork belly, egg and ramen. Interesting thing about the place is that you can 'build' your own ramen from choosing the type of broth, soup base, type of noodles and toppings which makes the whole experience more enjoyable. After having our meal, the staff requested to take a photo with us with our empty bowls which was unexpected.  Really appreciated their spontaneity and cool take on the whole ramen enterprise."}
{"text":"Very good, ordered the cold noodles which has a side soup for you to dip your noodles in to eat. Noodles come dry in a bowl is a the feature. Only thing is very pricy."}
{"text":"I had a horrible experience at this kinton location. Let me explain:  After lining up with my husband and baby (who was in his stroller) in the cold for 30 minutes, we finally got inside the restaurant. After another 5-10min it was finally our turn to be seated. There was a fantastic table that was able to accommodate our stroller, but we were told by the manager that we were not allowed to sit there, that we had to wait for one particular table...and that was the only table we were allowed to sit at. When we saw which table we were asked to wait for, we were appalled that the table he wanted us to sit at was at a long communal table. That table would have had very little space for the stroller and once parked would even block other guests from getting in/out of their seats. My husband and I tried to talk to the manager about the seating situation and even showed him how the other table had ample space around and wouldn't end up blocking staff/patrons. However, the manager said it was \"his rule\" (we clarified it was not a fire hazard rule, it was his own rule making) and that no matter what, he would not allow us to sit anywhere except where he told us to sit. He said \"it's not the space that's the issue, it's because of 'the rule'\".  At the end, 4 tables behind us ended up getting seated first while we had to wait for that one table to free up. It was unfair and very discriminating of the manager. When we were finally seated, we ended up blocking two other guests that wanted to get out of their seat and I had to get up multiple times to let them go in/out. The stroller also blocked up a seat and no one would want to sit in the seat directly across the stroller,so they also ended up losing 2 spaces that could have seated other people. On top of that, because it took us so long to get seated,by the time we ordered and our food came (more that 1.5hrs), my baby got hungry and needed to be fed...meaning my bowl of ramen got cold while I breastfed my baby (who was fed prior to our visit to the restaurant and was happy up until that point). I think the manager finally realized his mistake as he finally apologized and discounted our gyoza for free. However, it did not save our meal...which was pretty much ruined. We got to the restaurant at 2pm and did not leave the restaurant until 4:30pm.....it was ridiculous. We will never return and we definitely will not be recommending this restaurant to families and friends.   PS. After our visit, I found this out about this location:  Kinton Ramen (5165 Yonge St.) Inspected on: October 30, 2014 Inspection finding: Yellow (Conditional) Number of infractions: 3 (Significant: 2, Crucial: 1) Crucial infractions include: Operator fail to maintain hazardous food(s) at 4C (40F) or colder.  Beware, go at your own risk."}
{"text":"I find it unbelievable that the reviews have anything lower than 5 stars. Quite frankly I think this place does ramen as good as you get in Tokyo. The noodles are perfectly al dente, the char shiu is nice and thick- oh absolutely delicious ! If you know what REAL ramen is, forget the rest!"}
{"text":"I ordered the pork ramen combo with Age Gyoza. Everything is just ok, not as good as I expected."}
{"text":"Incredible ramen! I always get the spicy garlic one, and it's the best ramen I've ever had. The staff are very friendly, the atmosphere is loud and fun - this is one of my favourite places in Toronto if I need to grab dinner with a friend or two.  Even though I always get their karaage (fried chicken), I wouldn't recommend it - I find their isn't enough seasoning and it's a bit rubbery.  Regardless, I expect to come back many times over the next year just because of the taste of the ramen and the atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Step 1: chose pork ramen broth Step 2: chose shoyu flavor with soy sauce, bean sprouts, scallions, nori and pork Step 3: thin noodles Step 4: add a seasoned egg  Results: a flavorful savory broth. The noodles are fresh made and cooked just right.   Very reasonable price at $10.99  Excellent!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for a late lunch here. 5 stars for service, ambience and decor. Server was very pleasant too. Food was ok though. It was missing something, cant point out what though. Got edamame too, and it was just salted. Wasn't the best ramen ever but still not too bad."}
{"text":"I liked the torched fatty pork but the untorched one in the broth doesn't taste as good. Broth is ok. Boiled egg is delicious, it is marinated and the yolk is semi solid, the best part of the meal. The seats and tables were cramped and uncomfortable."}
{"text":"I frequent Kinton Ramen after classes at least once or twice a week. The classic pork shoulder ramen with light broth is pretty good, and it's what I get most of the time. As far as portions go they're decently large for the price.  The only reason that I don't give them a 5-star rating is that their gyoza aren't quite up to snuff.  Gyoza at this particular Kinton Ramen is more like pot-stickers than gyoza."}
{"text":"Pretty good spot. Appetizers were on-point. They have some good deals on Sapporo as well."}
{"text":"I like Kinton ramen. It has good crunchy and soap is ill salty. I ordered the soyu ramen. The long waits I hear are really annoying. Luckily the 2 times I went were at odd hours of weekday 11am and weekend 3:30pm. So we were seated right away.   I still feel Kenzo Yonge/Steeles is the best in terms of ramen in TO. Perhaps because it was my first try.   I still find the price is getting expensive. It's now like what $12 a bowl ? You can buy frozen Raman at the supermarket and miso soup base to make then add in whatever ingredients you want."}
{"text":"Hmmm, I've had almost every ramen on their menu and each time I finish a bowl I cry a little... because I could've had a CHEESE RAMEN!  They are my self-declared Toronto Ramen Champion... good job.  Noodles are 'al dente' and the broth is just so delicious. plentiful tender meat portions. I love how they sear the meat just before serving. I haven't found too much difference between Rich, normal, and light broth versions.  try the cheese ramen. :)"}
{"text":"I was lucky to be seated at the bar right infront of where all the action happened. It was so entertaining to watch all the food being prepared. I don't think I would have enjoyed my food as much if I wasn't sitting there. As a huge fan of Guu, I was expecting so much more.   I ordered the Shoyu ramen with pork belly. The noodles were cooked to perfection, but I didn't find the broth to have much depth or complexity. It came with only one piece of pork belly, which definitely wasn't enough. There is an option on the menu to add more meat, but I didn't opt for it since I wasn't expecting such a lack of meat. Luckily we also ordered the Karaage, which was a decent portion for $4.80. It was juicy, tender and fried to perfection. It more than compensated for the lack of meat in my ramen. We also had an order of gyoza, which was good, but not spectacular.  I wasn't blown away by the food. The food was more than decent, but it just live up to my expectations. Knowing what I know now, I think I will enjoy the food a lot more on my next visit."}
{"text":"I tried their Spicy garlic pork belly with thick noodle and regular pork broth. First I wanted to go for the rich broth, but the server explained that rich broth will only add extra pork oil in the soup, not necessarily the flavour. So beware of that.   The noodle was really thick; very hard to chew and it didn't really have any flavour. It's very disappointing  that BOTH the ramen soup and the pork belly didn't have flavour at all (not even after I added some soy sauce), it was just plain spicy!  Besides from their location, decoration and friendly service, I have to say it's the worst ramen noodle I've ever had in Toronto. This gonna be my first and last time at Kinton, unless they make some changes to the dishes."}
{"text":"Went to Kinton today for lunch and, similar to Guu (same owners), the waiters and waitresses are friendly and welcome you in with shouts.   The ramen was nice and hot (great for the -25 degree day today), which was much better than Momofoku's ramen, which I found was more warm than hot.  Thick noodles were delicious and perfect texture.  My brother and I ordered the Shio Pork ramen with shoulder and Spicy Garlic ramen with belly.  The Shio was quite good, although not as creamy as I wish it could be (not a tonkotsu).  I would not suggest ordering the spicy garlic as the flavor was quite bland to the point that I had to ask for salt (in which the waiter looked at me bewildered and brought me enough salt to raise my blood pressure a few notches.... i only wanted a little, I swear!).   Also, my breath still smells like garlic despite brushing my teeth and using mouth wash.  The shoulder and belly was nicely seared with a blowtorch and flavorful, one's choice would depend on how fatty one likes one's meat.  Overall, great place for a cold day.  Cheaper than Momofoku and on the same level of quality.  Don't order the spicy garlic unless you are obsessed with garlic."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh where to begin!  I remember seeing people line up in droves at the Baldwin location and thinking, what's all the fuss about this ....kinton ramen? (trying to read the sign) But Ramen is indeed something the get excited about and I learned that when I tried it out last night!  First of all the service is exceptionally friendly, the servers are always one step ahead of you and just really pleasant. Don't come here if you're looking for a relaxed atmosphere, you're only here to eat ramen (and I don't mean that in a bad way  :P).  I ordered the miso ramen with chicken breast, 2 other of my friends ordered spicy pork, and the other two ordered miso chicken and shoyu pork.   So ramen is amazing, the way they make the broth I have no idea but it's liquid perfection and I could eat it forever; but despite my wish the bowl does in fact end and all you are left with is pure satisfaction while also wondering what bowl you'll order next time (I have my eye on the spicy pork).  Every component was great, chicken cooked perfectly, noodles perfect, broth amazing, and it's so fun to eat! The perfect canvas for flavour. No wonder all the success.   5-star, oh yeah."}
{"text":"Simply the BEST one in town! Been there a few times - more than other ones I've been to. Simply a  MUST for all Ramen Lovers out there!"}
{"text":"I love this place. The pork shoulder ramen was perfect for a winter's night.  The thick noodles were the best I've ever had. We were lucky we went early on a weeknight, because the place is small and it gets very busy. I'll go again."}
{"text":"I'd dare say it's a destination worth traveling for. They've brought the same great food to a location that has an interesting open layout.  Staff are always awesome and the food is tops."}
{"text":"Very cramped. Uncomfortable hard wooden stools as seats. Selection is ok, what you would expect for a Ramen place. The ramen is ok, pork is good, but broth is very salty. I've tried Ramen in Japan, USA, Hong Kong and they were much better. This place is okay and the price is okay but nothing overly impressive. If there is a long wait I wouldn't bother."}
{"text":"Going in, I was a bit wary since this place had a 3.5* rating, but there was a line out the door even at 9pm on a Monday. It's popular, so hopefully it was going to be good.  It's a narrow restaurant with stools along long tables, a bar and right in front of the kitchen. I was very excited to find a ramen restaurant that let you see the action. It was all very high energy with the waitresses and cooks greeting customers as they entered and left and loud music which was usually upbeat jazz. There's a wood motif going on there with wooden stools, tables, ladles, and walls made of 3\" blocks.  They have some traditional ramens as well as some modern interpretations such as the spicy garlic and the cheese ramens. We ordered the miso ramen and spicy garlic ramen. The waitress asked if we wanted shoulder or belly. Pork fat good. So we got the belly.The waitress then asked how rich and fatty we wanted the broth. My heart skipped a beat. More pork fat please. The noodles were chewy and consistent with the alkaline noodles that I've had. The broth is pork bone based and ,according to their website, boiled for 20 hours. They don't have a tonkotsu ramen on the menu, but since they need to use their broth as the base for all the other ramens, I guess they had to hold back on the collagen that would have been needed for a tonkotsu. The pork belly was about the size of 2 slices of thick cut bacon and quite tender.   The spicy garlic ramen was spicier than what I was expecting from a Japanese restaurant. The heat level was around what a typical jjigae would be. The heat and the garlic ended up masking a lot of the pork flavor and the beansprouts and scalliions didn't stand a chance. It's a good soup if you're a chile head and looking for something new.  The true star though was the miso ramen. It was acccompanied with corn, garlic oil and what I think was a bit of finely shredded pork. The nutty flavor of the miso was balance well with the pork stock and the extra pork fat. I couldn't stop smiling as I ate it. I'll have to try the shio next time for the unadulterated pork flavor.   It's nowhere near to what I had at Monta in Las Vegas which started my hunt for the perfect ramen, but it is definitely worth the trip and the wait in line."}
{"text":"Spicy Garlic Ramen. Rich broth. Pork belly. Oh, and some Spicy Chicken Karage please.  Awesome music (search up \"Symmetry\" by FreeTEMPO for a listen), intimate setting, warm service, incentives (e.g. bowler pins when you completely down your noodles and soup).  Eggs aren't as flavourful as Kenzo Ramen's, the line up can be long (15-30 minutes), but in every other regard, Kinton Ramen is the best ramen house in Toronto.  IRASHAIMASE!"}
{"text":"The space is beautiful - a long, skinny, wood infused room with a long standing bar (with bar stools), a long counter, a teeny tiny table at the back.  All the tables are VERY communal.  I think the Guu crew design their furniture for sylph-like Asians and not us burly North Americans.   Now let's get down to brass tacks.  We ordered the gyoza, which were delicate, small, and a bit of a gouge at $4 for the portion.  We had the karaage (fried chicken), spicy, which was light and crunch in the Korean fried chicken style.    My dining companion ordered the spicy garlic ramen with pork shoulder and I had the Kinton ramen, shio style, with extra pork (I chose belly).  You choose your broth type (miso, shio [sea salt], shoyu [soy]) then you decide whether you want your broth regular (where they thwack pork back fat through a sieve onto the broth) or light (sans pork back fat thwack) and then you pick whether you want kinton pork shoulder or kinton pork belly.  Simple.  The broth is full-flavoured and the ramen is exemplary.  Unlike Kenzo, here the ramen is thick, chewy, al dente.  Very satisfying mouth feel.  It comes with the de rigeur runny boiled egg.  It is delicious.  The broth was a touch salty for my liking, but it's a small quibble (find me a ramen place where the broth isn't salty!).  I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"The ramen at this place is pretty good but the long wait times, crowded tables and sweltering heat hardly justifies a second visit. There are many other ramen places that offer both tastier food and a more comfortable seating.  There are some nice touches to the place. The decor is well done. The washroom is spotless. The style of shouting hi and bye to customers in the isakaya style adds to a convivial atmosphere.  I liked my first visit but probably wont go for seconds."}
{"text":"Funky place and good food but overall it's a bit overrated. Not really  worth the long wait."}
{"text":"This place gets a solid 4 star in my book. Had the regular soup shio ramen extra pork (shoulder and belly meat combo). Original chicken karaage was flavorful and crispy. So good.  Tried out Sansotei but like both the ramen and karaage here at Kinton. I can wait 30 minutes for this meal.  Will return to try the spicy chicken karaage and delicious ramen."}
{"text":"I can always count on Kinton to satisfy my ramen cravings. I frequent this location because it is closest to my work but I visit their other locations as well. My go-to ramen is their chicken jalapeno ramen with thin noodles, chicken breast, seasoned egg, seaweed and corn. Their seasoned egg is unlike any other in the city; it's the best with that soft custard yolk and slight salty flavour. Great price for the portion you get at Kinton, and the atmosphere is so fun there!"}
{"text":"Service is slow. Waited almost 30min for the ramen. Ordered thin noodle but is a bit over cook so it is soggy. Thick noodle is better.....Maybe they just opened and need some time to adjust and hope it run smooth in the future."}
{"text":"I love this place. Especially this location. I always get the spicy pork with extra pork and extra noodles. Never disappoints. One of the better ramen places in Toronto even as a chain. But I like it because it's safe."}
{"text":"This small spot is super busy. Attempted to go twice during lunch till we finally decided to try again at 2pm. very limited seating. Portion size of ramen is just right. I ordered the spicy pork. Pork slices were sooo tender. Had a side of chicken karage as well which was a nice addition. Would go back if ever in the area and have a hinkering for some ramen."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to kinton ramen and have been to the downtown location loving the flavours and generous portions.   The markham location here though was a major disappointment. Service was very slow even though there were not that many people on a tues. To top it off both of us later got a stomach ache which turned into us being in the washroom for a few days. :( either the soup was ultimately too greasy and wasn't skimmed or something went bad after ( which we don't want to know )   I wouldn't recommend a return visit. Save your money and go downtown."}
{"text":"Original Chicken Ramen tasted delicious especially with the seasoned egg. The side of Original Chicken karage was hot and fresh. Takoyaki was saucy and soft. Place is small but the serves and cooks are very nice and friendly!"}
{"text":"This place is continuously getting more expensive but he food is not increasing. Also today they completely forgot my order once it was placed. When I questioned them about it they gave me a 4 minute bullshit explanation. I'd rather they just admit that they forgot it. I'd be less angry. I waited over 45 for my food after i had ordered. This place is constantly getting worse and worse."}
{"text":"Food was good as always but the service today was painfully slow. Sitting what felt forever before anyone spoke to me. Not to mention standing at the door for almost ten (with half empty restaurant) before I was seated. This is a horrible down grade from the last time I was here. Hopefully it was just an off night."}
{"text":"I've been twice. Found the pork ramen to be too fatty. The chicken ramen was OK. The spicy chicken ramen has a nice kick to it though."}
{"text":"$14, including tip, for a moderately-sized bowl of ramen and a piece of pork belly; not sure if that is worth it!  The noodles and soup were delicious (not sure if it was just because I was hungry and it was cold outside), but nonetheless, it really hit the spot. However, I must say that the fullness doesn't last very long since I was hungry again after a couple of hours.  The interior is very nice though; the seating is very modern and decor is very hip. The lighting is also quite relaxing, though the noise level is pretty high. I felt like I had to scream at my friends in order to be heard over noise of others and the frequent shouts from the chef.  The only complaint I have is that the ramen and portion didn't feel worth it for the price that I paid, and also it took awhile to get to our table. I may come back again, or maybe try a different restaurant on Koreatown, but for me, this place was just OK."}
{"text":"I was very excited to try out this Ramen house here in Toronto, especially after visiting the website and hearing the fact that this was opened by those from Guu, it got me very excited.  We arrived before the restaurant opened for it's dinner service on a Monday evening and there was quite a few people waiting around to have a first crack at the seats.  Once opened we were quickly seated, the decor is great, the greeting by all kitchen staff was very reminiscent of many of the other Ramen houses I have been to, it was all looking very good.  The selection of noodles looked great but then the food arrived and well I can't say that I was very impressed.   When in a Ramen house, the first thing I like to do when receiving my food is sip the broth, I had ordered the Kinton Pork Ramen and well the broth really did not please my taste buds, bland and a bit to oily for my liking, I then proceeded to the noodles which were fine, but nothing to write home about, I had ordered an egg with my soup which is usually one of my favourite treats when having Ramen and again it was runny in the middle and well was underwhelming, I will say the pork was DELICIOUS, the pork was the best part of the meal.  I tried a bit of my co diners meals the Spicy Garlic Ramen and Mi so Ramen and again I was extremely underwhelmed.  I had been lucky to have been to Momofuku and Ippudo in NYC just a couple weeks prior to this visit and perhaps was comparing Kinton to those experiences, and it just did not live up to my expectations.  I do not think I will be returning and I wouldn't really recommend this place if there is a wait for a table, Not really worth it in my opinion."}
{"text":"Food was good!  We had a party of 6, five of us ordered and the waitress totally forgot to take the 6th person's order...  Ordered nestea 3 times but never came, the bill charged us for 2 nestea...   Friend ordered beer, waited 20 mins for it and it didn't come. Friend had to ask for it and then arrived 10 mins later."}
{"text":"I have ample time to review the service as I'm sitting here waiting for my ramen.  It has easily been 40 min, the restaurant is not even half full, and yet...no ramen...  There are 4 people at the kitchen area, 2 servers...but no ramen..."}
{"text":"Great ramen and pork belly. Yummy. Line up often long. Finish the soup to get a souvenir."}
{"text":"This place can be a bit loud with the music, other customers and employees but the ramen here sure is tasty. I absolutely love adding an extra egg too and would definitely recommend that other people do the same as well. Restaurant decor is also very modern and visually appealing."}
{"text":"Probably my favorite place for ramen in Montreal. Haven't found another place in Montreal yet that can satisfy my ramen craving as well as Kinton!  Order: - Original Ramen (Thin noodles, Pork) + butter + corn + garlic oil  Food: Broth is rich, flavorful and creamy. The portion is large and generous. If you do chose one of the ramen without the seasoned egg I do recommend taking it as an extra, definitely worth it! The egg is seasoned in soya sauce with a soft egg yolk. The extra garlic oil topping adds a bit of a bitter taste to the broth. Don't take the butter extra unless you're willing to have a huge knob of butter in your ramen. Noodles are nice and springy.  Service: Nice and quick service, friendly staff. The place is fairly small, waiting lines are expected if you go during peak hours.  Price:  ~15$ -  A bit on the pricy side for ramen but worth it!"}
{"text":"The prices for additions (i.e. scallions, egg, etc.) are quite high. $20 for a bowl of ramen is really too much.    However, the spicy jalapeno chicken ramen is amazing."}
{"text":"great customer service! Love the original ramen and the seasoned egg is so good! The other flavours of ramen is too salty... I would recommend you to try the original one!"}
{"text":"Couldn't competitive to the downtown main store. soup is too salty. Always line up,and parking is a headache"}
{"text":"Probably 3.5 stars.  I like Kinton Ramen, the service is great, the noodles are firm and the broth is full of flavour. Portions are ok, but I feel I would be a bigger fan if the noodles came with more pork.   The line up both times that I've been have been non-existent to not too long a wait.  Tip: If you get the spicy garlic ramen, take the scoop of grated garlic out, put it in a separate bowl and add back in what you want/need. While the idea of grated garlic sounds fantastic, it can be a bit much."}
{"text":"I absolutely love the Kinton restaurants but considering that this was the location that my friends always talked about, I thought I'd go give a try. I went with a group of my friends, a group of 7. We got a table at the back almost immediately which is amazing. I love their modern design even though their restaurant is small. They have a stool-bar style of seatings so I hope you like to get comfortable with strangers! They'll sit right next to ya~ I love the overall environment of the place, the traditional callings from the servers and kitchen staff. Mind you, the kitchen is open concept. They have their traditional outfits which are amazing. I've only had their ramen (which I LOVE) I have yet to try their appetizers.   Kinton offers a \"Kinton Ramen\" card which provides you with a stamp each time you COMPLETELY finish your bowl of ramen, yes, including the broth.   Their menu is simple. You pick your soup base (as well as the thickness of the soup), noodles, pork or chicken (or both for an additional cost) and additional toppings if needed. I do recommend their regular broth because anything beyond that is pretty much super thick (I dont personally like thick soups but if you do, by all means)  Definitely a place to go back to."}
{"text":"Went to this Kinton Ramen restaurant located at Bloor St. W with friends just recently. We arrived there around 6pm and were quickly seated for 4 people in the restaurant. Surprisingly, we had a chance sitting at the bar this time. It's kind of best dining experience when everyone's so close. While waiting our food order at the bar, we apparently saw the people/chefs working in the open kitchen just in front of us. The way of how they cooked the ramen and put it in the bowl was really interesting to me. It just looked like a TV show playing in front of me, so amazing. More importantly, my order of original flavored ramen with porky belly came out so delicious that I couldn't stop eating and another bite... I definitely believed that all of my friends also enjoyed their dishes so much at that moment cuz they almost sipped up everything in the bowl."}
{"text":"Went in on a winter day and amazed by their interior."}
{"text":"Let me preface by saying that I am, in no way, a ramen expert. I went with two friends for lunch. The seating is mostly counter style with a good view into the kitchen and a very lively atmosphere.  I had the pork shoulder ramen with thick noodles and rich soy broth. The noodles were delicious, as was the pork shoulder.  The broth was a bit salty and fatty and could have been better. Nothing a little Sapporo won't fix. I might suggest trying the medium broth instead. I also tried my friend's spicy garlic broth but it was hideously garlicky.  There was practically a whole bulb of crushed raw garlic plopped on top so not for the faint of heart.  Overall very tasty and enjoyable restaurant."}
{"text":"This place has really subpar service, I ordered the spicy garlic ramen but asked to change it to chicken as I've seen them done this at that location and all the other kinton locations and the server said they were not able to change this. I pointed out they've always done this and asked for a reason why but she just stared blankly at me without stating why. On to the food, wait, I didn't get my food! I waited 30-45 minutes and then another server sheepishly came up to me to ask me what my order was!! That was your only job... And I was eating here at 9pm and it was not at all busy, they had one staff actually preparing the ramen and the rest of the staff were just idling around and chatting about grabbing bubble tea or some other nonsense. After they found out they totally forgot my order, all I got was a simple sorry... At this point im not even mad, just hungry and disappointed"}
{"text":"Really good ramen! Good price, good decor. Service was friendly but on the slow side. I would definitely go again!"}
{"text":"Really nice broth, soft boiled eggs and other fixings. The pork shoulder is dry and tough, though. I'd go with pork belly instead. Nice interior. But hard to enjoy with the loud oddly distorted music. They do not deal well with groups of 8 or so. The food was brought out in good time, but they wouldn't give us individual checks, and wouldn't split the check. It was a mess."}
{"text":"***3.5 Stars***  Made it out to Kinton on their opening day for lunch. We were the first and only ones there there but the place filled up within 10 minutes. The restaurant is quite narrow and most seats were facing the kitchen or the bar with only a couple tables suitable for groups. There were also \"seats\" near the entrance where you stand and eat... that or they didn't order enough chairs haha.  Food was decent, menu I clear and straight to the point. With almost all the ramens you get a choice of a light broth or heavier one and either pork shoulder or pork belly. I got the cheese ramen with pork shoulder because I figured since I was there, I might as well. The pork shoulder was a tad dry and my cheese ramen tasted good but was super cheese-y which made it very filling. The broth did not really stand out. However, I had a sip of my friend's light Shio ramen broth and it was very tasty.  Staff were very attentive and friendly, and it was really fun watching the kitchen work. I would come back and try another ramen, and maybe one of their snacks!"}
{"text":"Was staying at a hotel around the corner and stopped in for dinner by myself. Sat at the counter and ordered a bowl of spicy pork ramen. Open kitchen so you can watch them work which I love. Noodles were the perfect texture and cooked just right. The broth was very good. I ate most of the bowl without mixing in the giant scoop of minced garlic. After the garlic got in the broth it was way over powering. Spiciness was good though hot enough to enjoy and make my nose run a little, but not sweat or make my face numb. The only other gripe I have it the stools are not the most comfortable and they don't take American Express. I would eat here again."}
{"text":"Addicted to it.    SERVICE 3.5~4 / 5   +Enthusiastic and friendly staff   +Fast and attentive service, for a Ramen Bar    AMBIENCE 3~3.5 / 5   +Decor is modern-Japanese-bar style, generally satisfactory   *Everytime you enter or leave the restaurant, staff members' gonna shout out loud in Japanese to greet you / bid you goodbye (as long as they see you doing so)   *Similar thing happens when some certain types of dishes are being made, e.g. the spicy Karaage Ramen, served on Winter Mondays; the chefs are gonna shout in Japanese as they prepare the dishes, during which you can witness the birth of delicacy under their hands  You may find the asterisked features lovely (if you enter it on a culture-exploring voyage) or sort-of annoying (if you seek quietness while dining), or you may be totally indifferent to it. That's why the 3~3.5.    FOOD 4 / 5   +Their Ramen is a Must-Try if you are to crown yourself as a REAL Ramen-loving Torontonian. Personally recommend Original Broth if you want a \"safe\" start. Try others if you sure you are in charted waters. My all-time addiction is Spicy-Garlic w/ extra Jalapeño Paste.   +Menu is very easy to understand. Questions? Ask your attentive server.   *Their side-dishes, unfortunately, seem not so appealing to me as their Ramens do. But giving them a try does not cost you too much, (roughly $2, if my memory serves me right) so, why not?   *They do offer common, \"middleclass-wise affordable\" Japanese Sake, like Mio, ShoChikuBai.   N.B.: They offer you a \"Kinton-Bowler\" stamp-card, which is a way of hooking customers(but hell, I ike getting hooked by their Ramens). Each time you finish a bowl to its last drop, you can have a stamp. Collecting enough stamps yield some \"trivial\" yet lovely rewards, like a free gyoza side-dish etc (they will ask you if you like to take a photo with their staff in celebration of you finishing a bowl; I hardly see people refuse). You can get stamps from other Kinton locations within Toronto as well."}
{"text":"I got the shoyu ramen with extra noodles, extra pork belly, and two eggs to share. Regular broth, thick noodles. The egg was amazing, strongly recommended! Pork was perfectly cooked and I recommend the pork belly. I don't normally like fatty pieces of pork but this was amazing and just melted in your mouth. The soup was a little on the salty side. We also got a side of takoyaki which came with four octopus balls which were good."}
{"text":"Spicy pork ramen is so so so dope. So good. Noodles are not super fresh tasting but good enough. Broth is aces tho"}
{"text":"Spicy Garlic is the way to go! My husband and I come here quite often. It can get really busy, but we usually wait if there is a wait. The Gyoza here is really really good!"}
{"text":"When I decided to try out this restaurant for the first time, I was very dissatisfied and angry because of thr poor service. The restaurant got busy quickly and the servers got order my order (out of a group) wrong not once, but twice.   When I ordered the same appetizers as the other people in my group, my own appetizer was forgotten. The same food was first served to random tables a few times before being passed to me. What made me upset was when I saw the other tables telling the server that my food was not ordered, that server gave a blank look, walked away and left the food on the table for a few minutes before being transferred. The menu was short but servers couldn't understand what you want and  misunderstood my order. Although the noodles were ok/average. Overall, there are other ramen places and kinton locations that provide better food and service."}
{"text":"These few years, suddenly a lot of Japanese Ramen restaurant was opened in Toronto.   It was my first time to go to Japanese Ramen place (except like Japanese Ramen places).  I ordered garlic spicy ramen. Soup was little salty but I liked and actually okay when ate with noodle.  I am not sure Kinton is 4 stars because I have not tried other Ramen restaurant yet but I was able to enjoy the taste and also I would like to go to there again."}
{"text":"Best ramen. Their tender pork belly is so sexy. Their music choice is sexy. Broth is sexy. This is the sexiest ramen I've ever had."}
{"text":"\"Meh. I've experienced better.\"  is about right.  I'm going to get soo much hate mail for this but screw it, if you're going to make people wait in lines just to get in -- it better be damn good.  From the owners that brought you the GUU chain of restuarants, this is Kinton Ramen Noodle house.... got your attention just from that line, cause its all hype.  Don't get me wrong the place is neat and if you were lucky like me you got to sit by the glass area by the kitchen where you can see the noodle cooks going at it hardcore which is impressive ....its like when you first saw donuts being made in a Krispy Kreme factory, that kind of impressive.    And if you're used to GUU then you get the warm welcome and such that we're accustomed to.  But lets get down to business I'm here to judge the food not the setup!  Oh wait lets get first impressions out of the way.  Forget bringing large groups here it was tough enough for me and my bud just to get a seat.  Seriously its crazy busy....and I think a huuuge part of it is the GUU affiliation.    Don't bother bringing a date here ...at least not in Winter ....if want a second date that is.  Before getting to the menu, I have a basic equation for any soup with noodle dish whether it be Chinese, Japanese, Korean or Vietnamese and despite whatever they are named.  The broth better be tasty as hell, because all the flavors and ingredients are in the broth part.   The second part is the noodles that they are cooked properly and sometimes can get away with being tasteless if the texture and broth are done well.  Looking at the menu and the different ramen choices their name were indicative of what was in it miso ramen, shoyu (soya sauce) ramen and so forth.   I figure I want to taste the purest flavor of the broth and that I'm not going to muddy it with miso or shoyu...there was the sea salt option Shio Ramen (plus came with pork and seasoned egg).   I also ordered that and the Panche drink , not a fan of the name but it was a concoction of lemonade and Sapporo...sure why not.  I patiently waited for the my ramen, when I got it I waited and blew on it so it would get to and edible temp (we've all been impatient before with ramen and what happened...yeah a burnt tongue)  I tasted the broth and there wasn't really any flavor to it.  Fine I'll bite into the noodle and take some broth with it.   Didn't fare much better.  The noodles were more on the chewy side then al dente.  Somewhere between squid legs and regular noodles.     Either I was not used to the texture of Japanese Ramen or something.     After finishing it I asked the waitress did they have an option of cold broth to be served with the ramen for next time....and she said no.   Reason being the texture of this ramen was more like soba, and to me would have been excellent in a tasty cold broth (like a pork bone soup kind of broth) - that too me would have made this fantastic.   The pork itself and egg weren't anything special.  Funny enough the Panche was bloody fantastic...after having a hot soup meal the crisp clear cold Sapporo with the tangy lemonade made for a very refreshing drink after all.   I love Sapporo but was surprised by that concoction.    I don't know if I'll try the other \"famous\" noodle houses around Toronto, this gourmet noodle fad I think is just a phase.  If you're still hungry I'd suggest going two doors down to Hua Sang for the lobster special and a couple of beers (I also reviewed them)"}
{"text":"Me and my friends have had almost all the variations of ramen on the menu, but my fav is the Spicy Garlic Pork ramen, and I add an egg. The noodles are delicious and have great texture, the broth is spicy and garlicky and thick and soupy, and all the ingredients come together in such a way that the bowl is clean before you know it. We like going back and expect to go there many more times. Fast service. Great appetizers too."}
{"text":"Best ramen on Baldwin street!   But I'm getting tired with their taste after soooo many visiting."}
{"text":"First off, let me start off with why this could've been a 4 star. From the decor, to the super fast service to the stupidly stocked and amazing washroom, it really deserved a rating of its own.The music that was  playing was my favourite type of genre and anyone whose familiar with Yoko Kanno, would be happy to know they could enjoy their ramen whilst having their ears blessed by the cool music.  For food, we started off with their gyoza. To me, $3.50 for 4 pieces of gyoza is definately a steal. It was made perfectly for my mouth. It wasn't as crunchy as places I've tried at before but that's a plus on my side.  Now, I never had ramen before so I can't compare it to anywhere else. I ordered shoyu ramen and my boyfriend ordered miso. After eating, I could say that I don't like ramen. However, this is highly just preference as my boyfriend loved his and devoured his bowl to the core. My soup was so thick and strong, I just left it out entirely. The noodles tasted bland and I only had two small slices of pork whereas my boyfriend had 3 large ones.  Overall, I would still recommend this place to others as it's not a bad restaurant and judging by the happy customers leaving, the food is great as well, BUT beware light eaters such as myself as portions are very big! Ramen just didn't fit my taste buds. I will, however, come back and probably try their rice dishes instead.  So for now, 3 stars for Kinton Ramen."}
{"text":"I ordered the spicy chicken karaage ramen with egg. Love their half-boiled egg. Must order it with Ramen. I like their chicken karrage. It was deliciously marinated and super crispy. It was not very spicy but very strong garlic taste. The serivice was nice but slow."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite ramen in the city. The bowls are huge. You probably won't be able to finish it.  The broth is amazing and the noodles have a perfect texture. It's fun to sit at the bar and watch the kitchen.   I like the spicy garlic the most."}
{"text":"I had their Spicy Garlic Pork Ramen and it was awesome. I usually think all Ramen places taste the same but this one really stands out in my books! I would definitely go again!"}
{"text":"Love the noodle(very rich egg flour flavour, real RAMEN), the halfy boiled egg(very tasty).  The soup is good too despite a bit too salty(even i ordered light flavour soup) and too oily.  I am not a very big fan of their pork given it's not as tendered as i thought, the pork belly is \"OK\" but it's not the traditional \"cha siu\" that supposed to take place inside a bowl of ramen.  However I love their drinks and side dishes(the deep fry chicken is the BEST over all of the ramen place i have ever been to), very tendered and juicy and yet not OILY at all...........something you should try out  Last complain, is the line up all the time that drive me nuts........i am not going to line up an hour outside given the \"nice\" winter weather now, no chance~~"}
{"text":"The noodles were good and the broth had a nice flavor but it would have tasted way better with less salt. Even for someone who loves eating salty food, the salt content in their broth is very high. Other than that, the service was good. Would definitely go back but because of the salt content in their food, it's not a place I would visit regularly."}
{"text":"I would like to say \"this is the BEST ramen restaurant in TO.\"   Prices in general are average.  this place has quite a good variety of ramen, spicy miso, garlic....The soup base is not the usual miso ramen that I favor, but it's pretty darn good.  But try to go early for lunch or dinner as the tables are not that much during meal times."}
{"text":"3.5 stars.   I have been here regularly over a year. To be helpful, their chicken karaage is delicious and most ramen dishes are good too.   Unfortunately I cannot come back. My go to meals are the spicy garlic ramen or jalapeño chicken ramen. The last three times I went, I have had terrible gastrointestinal symptoms that woke me up at night. Maybe it was bad luck, but considering I never had those issues at any other kinton location, I've decided not to come back again :("}
{"text":"Great place, friendly service, and the ramen was very good. Had the spicy garlic pork ramen lunch special with gyoza dumplings and a tea, all excellent. A little pricy perhaps for lunch at $20 including tip but worth it I think."}
{"text":"I am a Kinton Bowler!!! If you eat all the contents (ramen, meat, etc) and drink the soup, you get the coveted title of Kinton Bowler. You receive a pin and a rewards card. Also you get a photo taken on their Ipad which is then posted on their Instagram account. In terms of having this loyalty program, very smart marketing.  In terms of food, the broth was delicious! The ramen was super yummy. I had the cheese ramen with pork belly. I never thought cheese in soup would be a good mix. I'm glad I ordered this.  Would I go back? Absolutely...I plan on becoming a Kinton Bowler every time I visit"}
{"text":"We finally went back to Kinton Ramen. The cheese on the Cheese Ramen was much smaller than the mountain of cheese shown in their promotion tweet. The seasoned egg was a hard-boiled egg with not much seasoned flavour and was refrigerator cold in the centre The additional topping of Kinton Pork Belly ($2.00) was not on my Shoyu Ramen. While I tried to explain this to the server my soup was getting cold. The additional topping of Pork Belly finally arrived. One side was luke warm, the other side was refrigerator cold. I tried unsuccessfully to warm it up in my bowl of Ramen. Rating: \"Unacceptable\" There are now many other new Ramen restaurants in Toronto."}
{"text":"Seriously can't go wrong here. There's a reason it's always packed.   My ultimate favorite is the spicy pork. The spiciness tingles but doesn't burn. The food always comes out really fast, even when there's a crowd.   Service is quick and friendly as well. The line moves quite fast even if you get there at peak time.   Me and my boyfriend have been doing this as date night every Friday for a month and a half, that's how good it is!   This stuff is legit Ramen, for sure"}
{"text":"good ramen!!!! feels like u r eating in japan... not recommend for a big group of ppl cause space is limited and is very busy..."}
{"text":"For the sake of scale, if Ajisen is a 1 at the bottom, Kenzo is a 5, & Momofuku (in NY) is a 10, I think Kinton is a 6.  Although it's probably one of the best ramen places in the GTA, Toronto deserves a higher tier of ramen.  I checked out Kinton one week following their soft launch and they are still smoothing out their service.  They don't have their liquor license yet & food was often brought to the wrong people.  I started with the house made lemon aid (not worth the $3), gyoza (average/wouldn't bother ordering again), & tofu nuggets (not bad).  I opted for the cheese ramen as I thought if noodles & cheese (mac & cheese) are good and soup & cheese (french onion soup) is good, then soup & noodles & cheese would be double plus good.  Sadly my logic failed.  Maybe it was because I chose to push all the cheese into the soup to melt it, as the melted cheese severely inhibited my ability to properly slurp the noodles.  Slurping ramen is the only way to get noodles laced with the proper ratio of broth.  The other issue the cheese causes is that I couldn't bring up the corn at the bottom of the bowl.  The broth (I had the regular) was tasty, but a bit on the salty side.  Sadly the noodles while good, are not hand pulled.  I had some of my wife's spicy garlic ramen with the light broth which was much better than the cheese ramen."}
{"text":"Service is good but the noodles are average not anything special. it's pricey for just a bowl of noodles with no vegetables just 2 pieces of meat inside. I will not go back."}
{"text":"Delicious and filling. Initially, I didn't enjoy it. I had the garlic ramen and couldn't finish it all and it made me feel slightly sick. It may be because I can't tolerate too much oil in my system. But I went back and had the miso ramen with butter, egg and pork belly (I was trying to go for Hokkaido style) and it was delicious and filling. The service was kind of slow, but it's ok. The butter is a dollar and extremely generous. I haven't had real Hokkaido ramen but it was literally a stick of butter. Suprising but really up to whoever eats it whether they want to take some out. Last time, I thought the noodles were kind of plastic tasting but it may be the texture that I'm not used to. They're very dense and firm which I really like. Now I'm craving another bowl... sigh."}
{"text":"over priced for the quality of food and hygienic level.  found a piece of 1 inch long clear vinyl in my soup.  informed the staff and they have offered me a new dish but already lost my appetite.  did not have to pay for that but do I wanna go back? , don`t know!!  why would I?  very similar to street noodle shop in osaka, japan from my experience.  glad to have that experience here in north york but need some improvement."}
{"text":"Def would come back here again.  There is a wait but what \"happening\" places in Toronto don't have a line up these days?  I had the spicy garlic with pork belly - highly recommended!  The broth had good flavour and some richness though a little too salty for my liking.  I think you can get a less salty version there.  Pork was great, tender and they gave you a generous meaty portion.  Also I loved the fresh grated garlic, gave it a good kick.  Noodles - no complaint, not too soft or hard.    Price is good especially because the portion they give you is huge!  Def worth it.  Didn't have any problems with service, sometimes it's a little hard to get their attention but it was packed.  It is a little loud there but fun."}
{"text":"2.5 for the food 4 for the service and entertainment   The service was excellent and it was really  entertaining sitting at the noodle bar watching the cook.  I had the spicy garlic with pork shoulder and the rich soup base.  I just put 1/3 of the garlic in and it was garlicky enough for me.  I thought the soup base wasn't spicy at all and it was too greasy and not that tasty, maybe I should ordered the light soup base instead.  I would go back again but will defiantly not order the same thing again."}
{"text":"The interior of the restaurant had nice decor but they kept it very warm inside. I proceeded to order the thick noodle miso pork ramen and gyoza for dinner while visiting from out of town. 5 stars for the gyoza. 2 stars for the ramen. The broth was rather light for a miso, bordering on bland. The pork was just okay, not very fatty but somewhat tender. Maybe it was because I had higher hopes for a 4 star ramen place but I was pretty disappointed. Almost gave it 2 stars but the gyoza was done pretty well so bumped the rating up. I won't be back though. Too bad. I love ramen..."}
{"text":"We tried two combos: a chicken in miso, and a pork in spicy. Some general thoughts:   -Thick noodle (not thin) is what you're used to.  -Spicy is quite spicy -- if you're more a \"mild\" spice level it'll be too spicy for you after a few sips. You'll probably need to be at least a \"medium\" spice level person to want to drink the broth after. -If you're doing the combo, get the ton ton bowl -- the sauce on it is sweet and is delicious over rice.  -The normal bowl has 2 slices of meat."}
{"text":"Authentic ramen- just as we had in Japan!  We normally get the Shoyu Ramen.  The broth is flavourful and the ramen is cooked to perfection."}
{"text":"Still the worst Kinton of them all. Orders forgotten and food quality is abhorrent. The ramen was beyond salty, it was like drinking the ocean. Pork belly is actually more like a pork lining.. Stingiest slices of meat, so thin they're transparent- SIGH."}
{"text":"Good ramen & gyoza! Broth and meat is really yummy.  The only downside is that you can not make reservations. Also, I don't like how they make you wait outside. :( Sadly, the time I went  was during the winter !! So we waited in the cold mehh.....   The staff is also really friendly :) I find that Japanese people are usually really lively at restaurants  Would come back though for the food~"}
{"text":"Extremely salty food, the portion is minimal, and the background music choice is poor. Servers ignores their customers constantly. Did I mention the food is not cheap either?"}
{"text":"Came here again by chance and the place has not improved at all.  Egg in the soup was rotten and the meat was cold and extremely salty.  Asked the waitress for more water and she brought me the bill instead."}
{"text":"I'm not a ramen expert - never been to Japan either. But if you love pork, salty flavors, and noodles, get in line here. It's worth the wait. My favorite is the Shoyu Ramen with rich broth and pork belly. The belly is like a 2cm thick cut of bacon, and the fat is delicious. I've come back 43 times and they never disappoint.  I've been to Santosei, Santouku, and Kenzo, and Kinton is definitely my favorite by a long shot."}
{"text":"The spicy garlic is my favorite ramen in the city. I did try all of the 8-10 ramen places around. Note: don't put all the garlic in ;)  With the server \"greeting\" the customers, the music level and the layout of the place, this place is quite loud.   Would say it's a bit hard to get seats if you are 4 or more.   Expect a line-up."}
{"text":"I'd give 2.5 stars  Broth is too salty!   But the toppings are good. Needs a larger portion of meat!  Noodles are nice and chewy."}
{"text":"I just CAN'T get enough of that spicy garlic ramen. The service is average but the atmosphere and food more than make up for it.   Bowlers unite."}
{"text":"clean. modern. came early so no wait. had some kimchi, fried chicken, octopus taco which were good. ramen was quit good and filling. service was also quit good. would recommend."}
{"text":"Mediocre Ramen at the Kinyton north York location.  I find that the one downtown have better ramen then the one up north.  We ordered the spicy karage.  Moist and tender. Not much change between the two locations.     If you must try Kinton I suggest to try the own downtown rather then the one in North York."}
{"text":"Luv going to kinton when we arrive late into the city! They generally serve a hot, tastey  and perfectly cooked ramen! I'm saying generally as we were disappointed for the first time in 10+visits where the broth was lacking,  noodles were undercooked and the egg was lacking flavour! Really hoping it's a one off as we enjoy our late night ramen fix!"}
{"text":"It is hard for me to review Kinton Ramen because they've just been so damn inconsistent.    The first time I went was during their soft opening.  Everything then was PERFECT, from the richness of the broth (i had the shiyo ramen) to the texture and taste of the noodles to the utter deliciousness of the pork belly.  The chicken karaage, which we ordered as an appetizer, was also so yummy; it was lightly breaded on the outside, and so tender and juicy on the inside that it almost didn't need the accompanying mayo.    The second time I went was a complete disappointment.  I again ordered the shiyo ramen and was upset to see that rather than giving me two pieces of pork belly, which I came to expect after my first visit, I was given one small, measly piece.  The broth also felt...thinner...than usual and there was a lack of density to the entire meal. In addition, the chicken karaage we ordered was stone-cold.  Thinking that maybe my second visit was a fluke, I again went for a third time.  This time, my ramen (again, the shiyo) was a bit better, but nowhere as good as the first time I tried it.  They thankfully gave me two pieces of pork belly once more but this time forgot the egg that came with the ramen.  The bottom line is that I think Kinton Ramen needs to find its legs first.  It *just* opened this summer so I suspect that a lot of the mistakes I noticed during my second and third visits emerged because the kitchen is still trying to come to a better rhythm.  What gives me hope is that my first meal there was truly spectacular.  Here's hoping that Kinton lives up the promise it once showed."}
{"text":"I have been to Kinton Ramen before, but this was my first visit to the church street location.  I still love the concept and I like the simple ordering.  I ordered the miso soup with thick noodles and pork.  It was good but very very salty.  Like too salty.  The waters were replenished regularly which was great, because, as mentioned, my food was very salty.  My one pet peeve with the concept of small table and stools to sit on is there is no where to put your bag, and coat.  There is a coat rack in the back, but I'm never a big fan of leaving my coat in the rack.  Again, my own pet peeve. Other then that it was a good dining experience.  I left quite full, and satisfied."}
{"text":"The restaurant had a great atmosphere and the food was pretty good. My only complaint would be that the soup was a little salty for my taste."}
{"text":"I love ramen and Kinton is pricey compared to other ramen places but it is still great ramen.  It is very small and cramped area which is a downfall."}
{"text":"I've eaten at this place a couple of times now. One of the better ramen places that I've been to. Very good flavour and I recommend getting the extra pork. I will definitely come back. The only compliant I have is that after the meal I can't stop drinking water for at least 4 hours. I'm sure there is a lot of salt in the soup although the flavour is very good and it doesn't taste too salty. The service was very friendly as well."}
{"text":"Honestly, one of the worse. Left with half our bowls of ramen unfinished. Broth has some major issue, very one dimensional, bland and left an extremely bad after taste. Noodles soggy. Gyoza arrived ice cold in the center. Dine mid day with only 3 other tables, no excuse for average service and poor preparation of food."}
{"text":"I went back here for the third time last week and I have to say I'm a huge fan of this place. The no reservations/won't take your cell phone number policy is the only real downside as there is frequently a long line especially if you are coming with a group.  In terms of appetizers the tofu nugget and kimchi are both excellent, as are the gyoza. The fried chicken was a touch sweet for my liking but was good nonetheless.   Re: the ramen, I have tried the Shio, Shoyu and the spicy garlic and while all were great I found the heat and garlic flavour (note the garlic is a grated raw clump that you put into the soup yourself) of the latter soup overpowered the other flavours, which is a shame because the broths of all of the ramen are unbelievably delicious.   The the eggs in the Shio and Shoyu were perfectly cooked and had rich oozy centres.  Also important to note is that when you order the ramen you will get asked whether you want it light, medium or rich (ie. how fatty you want the broth to be) and whether you want pork shoulder or pork belly (only applies to the ramen that have meat in them). In my opinion the winning combo is the medium broth and pork shoulder (vs. the belly); while I know most people's instinct is to go for the fattier cut (ie. the belly) in this case I would argue the very intense flavour of the shoulder is the better call especially given the broth is already plenty rich.   Check this place out, I highly recommend it.  -Brian   PS - draft Sapporo for under $6. Win!"}
{"text":"I really wasn't impressed with Kinton's ramen. I went with two friends, both of whom have been to Japan, and they had the same reaction.  I ordered the spicy garlic ramen with regular broth. The noodles were cooked well, but the broth was shockingly bland. It just didn't have any of the punch that a good ramen broth is supposed to have.  If you're looking for good ramen over nice decor, get yourself to one of Kenzo's locations and enjoy a flavourful and hearty bowl no matter which menu item you choose."}
{"text":"Love the staff there! Fun, energetic and welcoming. I felt like they had some sort of dance beats when they were preparing the food. Decent ambience.  I ordered the sea salt ramen... (can't remember the Japanese name though) with pork shoulders. Chewy noodles, well cooked. The two slices of pork were thick enough and had a smoked? taste to it and I like it. I would say the soup tastes great at first but a bit too salty near the end haha. So couldn't manage to finish the soup. Saw a kid finished his and took a picture with the staff though. Overall great place for Japanese ramen, may try other flavours next time and seasoned eggs."}
{"text":"First impression, great decor. The ramen was good but not much to say about it. Good noodles, 2 different meat (although not chashu) but so-so soup. The soup was in my opinion sweet and salty, so not my favorite. Not quite my taste but generally good. Good and fast service. Would maybe come back again when I'm around. Would recommend to people who are new to ramen because of its detailed menu and classic tonkotsu soup."}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings on this place. An offspring of Guu so expect long wait times for a spot at this tiny restaurant in Baldwin Village. Service is always good and they greet you as you sit and leave the restaurant. Don't expect to be mingling for long while you dine here as ramen is a fairly quick and inexpensive meal.   As for the actual food itself, we tried the Gyoza and it didn't inspire. Kenzo has one over them in this area. We tried the Tofu Nuggets and yes they are actual nuggets reminding us of McDonald's fame and were really tasty. Now on to the Ramen, the noodles are good (i don't believe they are housemade but probably outsourced locally), the broth is good with no signs of MSG but where I found the Ramen's lacking a bit were the meat and sides. They pre-cook everything and we found that the meat isn't piping hot or very tender and the eggs, although cooked to perfection, were a bit cold in the center. It seems like the Ramens don't really come together due to these points. It's nonetheless an entrant into the coming ramen wars in Toronto which I'm very excited about. I would definately give this place another shot in hopes i'm more inspired about the food."}
{"text":"It took them an hour to prepare our ramen from the time we ordered. What gives? Let's be honest here, it's glorified soup, how long does it really take to make? We were positioned in a corner and they forgot about our table completely, our drinks didn't come until we asked, at the same time the food arrived. Seriously, $15 for absolutely zero service, and a bowl of soup with scraps of meat. Ripoff. If you enjoy ramen, search Yelp for somewhere else."}
{"text":"Ordered extra pork belly regular ramen. The pork belly isn't tender enough. The soup is oily. The noodle is average. But they did a good job with the egg. The tofu nugget is ok. Nothing special"}
{"text":"Supremely disappointed that they changed their menu and got rid of the crispy ramen salad. I loved the crispy texture of the fried ramen with the greens and awesome sauce. Plus it had slices of pork inside.   Only this Markham location had the crispy ramen salad so I purposely drove up to this location to order it - as of this moment the menu on their website still shows it as available but in the restaurant itself it is not on the menu.  And waitress says it's no longer available.   I will no longer be coming to this location when I want Kinton ramen as there is nothing special about the ramen at this location. Menu selection and taste is the same as two other Kinton ramen locations I've been to."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. I ordered the peanut butter ramen, it was spot on. The flavour was very good and combinations Were creative. I would definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"A trendy hip take on ramen, the atmosphere and restaurant has a good metro city vibe with a loud energetic and happy staff. Service is quick and efficient so don't fear a wait list. They move quick.  I went on a Friday night so missed out on their Monday special, but based on the review below I'll be back.  I tried the Kinton ball for an appetizer and it was delicious. A little on the sweet side, the outside was crisp, flavored well, and unlike yesterday's meal at Reds, coated in a good amount of sauce. The pork filling and scotch egg were well cooked and flavored.  For a main course I opted for the chicken ramen broth, roast chicken, thin noodle, jalapeño paste, garlic and scallions in the original broth flavor. Overall flavor but could have used a bit more spice. The chicken was cooked perfectly and a sensible portion.   Keep in mind, this is not a quiet sit down and relax setting, if you are looking for good hot flavorful ramen and good quick service this is it. Worth the stop."}
{"text":"first time trying ramen and it was great!  i tried the spicy cirpsy chicken and the spicy garlic ramen.  Man was there tons of garlic and i love garlic! Surprisingly i liked the pork belly, usually that stuff doesn't appeal to me but it melted in my mouth while maintaining the crispiness.   I do plan on coming back to try other flavours of broths! Can't give it 5 stars (yet) since this was my first :)"}
{"text":"Even though this review is on the Kinton Ramen 5 page, the experience also comes from Kinton Ramen 2 on Bloor, which was equally great, to cut to the chase. Having eaten at the \"big 3\" ramen places in Toronto (that is, the most talked about ones, among other things), Kinton, Sansotei and Momofuku, I've concluded that Kinton is the best of the bunch. The portions are larger, and yet it's more affordable than the other two. I would shy away from getting the \"rich\" soup because it is essentially the regular broth, with lardons added to it (pieces of fat, if you're not from Quebec), which I personally was not a big fan of and had to pick around. However, the broth is rich and very umami, tastier than those of Sansotei and Momofuku. I would also suggest getting the pork shoulder (and doubling it, if you're super hungry), because there is a smaller meat-to-fat ratio, and so you get more meat. The spicy garlic is an excellent choice, or if you don't want excessive garlic breathe for the rest of your day, get the regular and ask for the Japanese chili flakes to put in to spice it up. My only criticism is that there are fewer accompaniments (egg, sprouts, corn, etc) than other ramen places; but I'd certainly sacrifice fewer of these for the greater amount of broth, noodles and meat they give you. I'd suggest getting a bar table by the open kitchen, because you get to watch the cook's at work, which can be very lively and entertaining (think teppanyaki but without all the fanciness). Would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"I ate Miso ramen here. I have to be honest to tell you that it was not a great taste because the soup didn't have any strong taste. If they served this in Japan they wouldn't survive for long. They hire Japanese staff so it looks like a Japanese owned restaurant but the owner is not Japanese. Please try to eat ramen at otherJapanese run restaurants....."}
{"text":"It was okay. I had the pork shoulder ramen with thin noodles and shoyu soup. It was very filling, but a little salty. Ambience was way too loud (Japanese music)."}
{"text":"My friends and I decided to come here on a Saturday night and boy did we come at the wrong time. We arrived around 7:30 (give or take) and because there were already people waiting in line with parties of 5-6, we weren't able to get a table till an hour later. What i didn't like was the fact they kept trying to separate our group when we came to Kinton to have a meal TOGETHER.   The food itself was good but nothing amazing. I had the spicy garlic ramen with pork shoulder. I enjoyed the noodle since it was cooked quite well and the soup base and pork shoulder was alright.  Overall to me, I think the hype might have made me expect too much from it (or the long wait might have ruined the magic). I think it was an alright place but I would only come if there wasn't a wait."}
{"text":"This is one of the reviews I love and hate to write at the same time. I love to encourage new folks to try my favourite ramen joint, but I hate to make the queues longer for the next time I'd like to eat there.   I only go to Kinton during the off-peak times, and even then I can be waiting up to 20 minutes to be seated. I always get the shoyu ramen with regular broth and pork belly now. I love salt, so maybe that's why I really like this broth. The flame-touched pork is definitely the best at any ramen joint I've tried in Toronto.   I can't even manage the appetisers because the ramen is filling enough for me, but the gyoza look delicious and tempt me every time."}
{"text":"Good fix for ramen cravings. Very friendly staff and simple menu. I have tried the downtown location, and tried this one since it was closer to my house. It is a very a spacious place and they have a place in the front to hang jackets since some of their seats don't have a back pan to hang coats. I thought the swiss cheese that can be added to the side was overpriced, it was $3.50 for a small dish of shaved cheese. It brought an additional taste of creaminess to the ramen. The meat was very soft and also tried their pork rice. Did not expect it to be the texture of tuna from a can, but the flavour was very nice over rice. The karage was also nicely fried with very juicy meat and came with a side of a slice of lemon and mayonnaise."}
{"text":"Love this place, their ramen is soo good! They grill the pork like no other and to perfection! And  for an Asian restaurant the decoration is much nicer to what I'm used to. But since its soo good, it gets busy in prime hours and weekends!"}
{"text":"We actually visited Kinton long time ago when they opened about a year ago. To be honest, it was not the most impressive ramen experience we had. Also, the online review and rating of Kinton are not that great so we never visited it again. However, we got to know a few friends who LOVE Kinton. By love I mean they are \"Kinton Bowlers\" and I can see them on my facebook newsfeed EVERY TIME they visit Kinton - \"xxxx 34th time\". JW and I are curious why they are so in love with Kinton so we decided to give it a shot again.    Like all other ramen restaurants, Kinton gives you the luxury of choosing a light,  regular or rich broth as well as the fattiness of your pork. You can go for a lighter pork shoulder or a heavier pork belly. Interestingly, when JW requested to have his noodles to be harder/firmer, the server said it cannot be done because their noodles are very thick and its already very firm.    JW's cousin ordered the Miso Ramen with pork shoulder and a regular broth. I ordered the Shoyu Ramen (Soy Sauce) with pork shoulder and a ligher broth. Overall, the broth was delicious but not as rich as other ramen restaurants. The pork shoulders were nicely torched locking the juice and fat inside the meat. Very tender and juicy. Despite of my choice of a ligher broth, the broth was still very flavourful and I enjoyed it a lot as I often find ramen broth to be a little salty and heavy for me. The seasoned egg that came with my Shoyu ramen was like the cherry on top as the half boiled yolk added extra to the broth.  However, the noodles were too hard that I thought it was uncooked after my first bite. This is true because the noodles were slightly thicker than normal ones thus giving its hardness and \"chewiness\". For people like JW who likes his noodles to be harder, Kinton's ramen would be perfect for him. But for people like me who like their noodles to be normal, this would be too hard.     JW had the Garlic Spicy Ramen with pork belly and a rich broth. At first, we were worried that the ramen would be too spicy. Yet, while every sip of the broth was deliciously filled with amazing taste of garlic as you can see the generous amount of minced garlic in the picture, the spiciness was rather blunt and weak. Overall, the broth did not have enough taste.    verdict:  ROASTED.  JW and I had a difficult time deciding whether Kinton Ramen is roasted or not. JW likes the hard noodles and how the spicy ramen was not too spicy but I am not a big fan of their noodles. The broth was delicious but it lacks flavour. Compared to other ramen restaurants, Kinton ramen was not the best among them all yet it is still a nice addition to Toronto's ramen restaurants. If we are nearby/ within walking distance, we would visit again. But if we have other choices like Santouka, we would possibly opt for that.  visit http://theroastedacorn.com/2013/06/27/kinton-ramen/ for awesome pictures of the food i mentioned above !"}
{"text":"I didn't expect too much from this place from what I read in the reviews. However, I thought it at least be decent.   I got the spicy garlic in rich broth with pork belly. soup was bland. noodles were alright. pork belly was good.   i also had the spicy fried chicken. sadly, this tasted better than the ramen.   the staff are super friendly tho.  but I am not coming back anytime soon!"}
{"text":"This place is overrated.   I think in large part it's because of the relationship it has with Guu. Or maybe my friends and I just simply don't like the style of Ramen they serve here. Either way, the food wasn't as great as many here made it out to be.  We ordered the spicy garlic and shoyu soup varieties. I chose pork shoulder for my meat add-on. The soup was a bit salty, but that's fine. The meat was prepared all right too. But the noodles? They were hard. Harder than a variety that I'm used to. My friends agreed with that assessment, including one guy who just came back from Japan a month ago (so his expectations are fairly high).  Appetizers were all right. Small for the price. 4 pieces of gyoza, 5 pieces of spicy chicken karaage with what seemed to be Rooster Sauce. Not really worthwhile getting.  We waited an hour to get in on a Saturday. Not worth the wait. Wouldn't go back even if it was instant service.   Perhaps the only saving grace for the food is that it's really filling. I felt full after finishing a bowl. I didn't drink all the soup either.  I think I'll stick with Guu in the future though."}
{"text":"Very good. I had the spicy garlic pork shoulder cheese ramen, and probably took half home. Huge serving; you could definitely share it with someone. I will return to try more of the menu."}
{"text":"The space is quite nicely done. Simple execution but very captivating wall treatment. Unfortunately I'm not sure if I would wait 45min again for the food. Ordered the miso ramen - overall avg, the pork belly was good, but imo the broth was too salty and spiced for drinking as a soup. Gyoza & karage were good but nothing exceptional. We waited for what seemed like too long for our food to arrive after putting in our order, but perhaps it's just a soft opening kink to be worked out. All the staff were very friendly, as expected. Will be interested in returning to see changes in the food & menu selection."}
{"text":"Decent broth, awesome noodles, good pork.  Definitely not worth the wait hence the 2 stars.  You can find the same type of place in North York and downtown.  Not unique at all!    But if you do want to try, I suggest going about 15 - 20min before opening (5pm) so you can get in the first sitting and not have to wait 45min - 1 hr."}
{"text":"Steps from U of T, Kinton is a bustling hub of good food and great atmosphere.  I've also been to the Bloor location and Baldwin is hands down the better of the two. The servers suggest that they have been working together for decades: they work together in an extraordinarily organized and elegant fashion.  I thought the ramen was delicious and considering the length of time we had to wait to get a seat, many others felt the same way.  I would definitely recommend going with a rich broth and a thick noodle (despite the fact that a thin noodle seems to absorb the flavour of the broth more completely). I had a drink, and unfortunately I've forgotten the name, but it was red wine with what I believe was lemon juice and perhaps grenadine(?); regardless, it was stunning and I'd be back just for that.  Well done Kinton, very pleased."}
{"text":"6 p.m. on a Wednesday- 40 minute wait. Great atmosphere, decor, very friendly staff and prompt service. I had the pork belly in regular-fat soy broth. The broth was delicious and the noodles were perfect- firm and very tasty. The only thing I didn't enjoy was the pork belly itself, which is a shame since I'm usually a big fan. It wasn't tender, was very fatty and seemed like it was just boiled in the broth. I'd try the pork shoulder next time."}
{"text":"Ordered Uber Eats from this location a couple nights ago, way too over priced.  4 small pieces of fried chicken appetizer costs $7.55, and the ramen costs $12.99 offering only two thin slices of meat on it.  Tasted average, but the portion and price does not add up at all.  Definitely will not get this again"}
{"text":"Didn't like the broth much as it lacked flavours just as others have mentioned. Would rather make a trip to downtown (to their competitors) for better ramen options."}
{"text":"If you live, work or travel near downtown Toronto, you may have seen numerous Japanese ramen shops. Often, the lines outside the ramen shops form before noon most days. Kinton Ramen 5 on Church Street is my regular ramen shop, simply because it is closer to my house and has incredibly great ramen. Kinton is an offshoot of the Kinka Family and there are 5 Kinton Ramen outlets in the Toronto area. The place is always packed and sports small but efficient layout. Despite its small size, it feels far more spacious. The room is warm and inviting, and the busy open kitchen makes it a lively place.  While they offer both pork and chicken broth, my go to pick is the spicy jalapeño chicken broth, served in a deep bowl and topped with incredibly tender sliced chicken breast. The jalapeño paste gives the soup a sharp kick that balances nicely with the chewy noodles. The broth is creamy with emulsified fat and it's amazingly tasty. Noodles are available both thick and thin at this location, and the choice of chicken breast and pork can be customized to order. You can also pick additional toppings like seaweed scallions, swiss cheese 3.5, bean sprouts garlic oil, nori, grated garlic, sweet corn, seasoned egg, etc.  Kinton Ramen also offers appetizers (tapas). My favorite is hot Karaage (spicy fried chicken). The karaage is delicious and the fried chicken was perfectly crispy and tender with and full of flavor. Ton Ton Don - chopped pork seasoned on rice comes with slightly sweet taste but it is subtle and not over-powering. I find their kari kari rice balls (deep-fried rice balls with pork filling to be very hard - akin to biting into a golf ball.   The bar offers a range of drinks including Sapporo beer and cocktails. They have a selection of refreshing mixed drinks Sapporo beer with ginger ale, but my favorite is pink Calpico - grenadine with Calpico (Calpico is a non-carbonated soft drink and has a somewhat milky, and slightly acidic/tart flavor, similar to plain or vanilla-flavored yogurt drink). Kinton Ramen 5 also offers a small dessert menu - I have tried matcha cheesecake and it's rather underwhelming.  Although Kinton Ramen 5 is a busy location, you get efficient and attentive service; and, the quality of food is always consistent. I am not a ramen a connoisseur; however, I think Kinton Ramen offers a deliciously buttery broth and perfectly cooked noodles - and that's certainly good enough for me."}
{"text":"Don't bother coming here - even Kenzo down the street is better for ramen.  Broth was very fatty; admittedly, I opted for the \"rich\" selection but specks of the fat started to congeal before I was even halfway through the meal.  I ordered the spicy garlic ramen and the seasoned egg was considered an extra charge.  It came with one lonely piece of pork belly which was also very fatty.  They really need to consider slicing up both the pork belly and the egg.  Broth was severely lacking flavour.  Takowasabi was very heavy on the wasabi and tasted like the packaged ones from T&T - definitely not made in-house like at some izakayas.    They charge $2 for green tea but at least it was quality, loose leaf tea served in neat-looking mason jar mugs (if you care about stuff like that).    Place is quite small, with a long communal bar around the cooks, one long table at the front (to seat about 8) and the rest were small tables for ideally 2, however, these can fit 3.  Music was overly loud and so was the chef & waitstaff team's constant calling out in Japanese.  I've been to Guu - I get it - but it was really overdone here and just too loud for a small non-izakaya type of place.  Only upside was the parking lot right next to it."}
{"text":"My friend and I are trying to try all the ramen restaurants in downtown Toronto, since we've been craving it. As the weather gets colder, ramen hits the spot. We arrived early, before they opened, to avoid line ups. We were seated and placed our orders quickly.  The noise level escalated as the restaurant filled up. The narrow space was well laid out to seat as many people as possible within a small space. We sat right infront of the open kitchen area and watched as they prepared the food.  The ramen arrived relatively quickly. All soup-bases are miso based, sadly no tonkotsu.   It was a little disappointing. The best part was the pork belly, absolutely delicious, but the rest of it was alright. The noodles are pretty good, the soup was okay. Nothing amazingly memorable and by the end I didn't feel like it filled my ramen craving. My friend and I debated going to another place and getting more ramen.  I got the spicy garlic ramen. Very very garlicky, usually I'm not bothered by it, but I didn't feel like the soup-base was worth the garlic breathe that I'm sure I had afterwards.  I prefer Sansotei. Kinton is not a bad restaurant, nice decor, just not worth the hype that it's been getting."}
{"text":"Being Japanese, I must say that Kinton started as a Ramen trendsetter in Toronto. But as time went on, the soup started to feel a little too thick for my liking.   I think they're catering more to the Chinese and Canadian customers that want a 'pow' experience. I just want a good, simple bowl of Ramen.   The 'Kinton Bowler' is a great way to engage with customers, but I think it's a bit overdone, and takes away from serving a simple, Ramen that makes me feel good.   My recommendation is to go back to its roots and serve really awesome food."}
{"text":"Kinton's ramen are supposedly pork bone based but I don't really taste it that much. My friend ordered Shio ramen and I ordered Garlic ramen. Hers was a tad salty and for mine, while it is not bad, it didn't have any pork bone taste despite asking for the richest level. The noodles itself was very good though; just the right chewy-ness. The pork belly is delicious too. My only problem is the not rich at all broth. Sansotei's broth wins hands down!"}
{"text":"Went alone on a weekday lunch and thank god the place wasn't filled! After walking in the cold almost freezing to death I was greeted  quickly seated in front of the bar man it felt good under this warm and welcoming atmosphere! I ordered chicken ramen and hot karaage and the food came quickly. The karaage was served first and there were 5 big chunks of juicy chicken soooo goooood but I would like it better if the sauce was spicier, I didn't find it spicy at all actually...but it was still good! Then came the original chicken ramen which I devoured at an instant, the chicken breast was tender and the broth was amazing! But maybe it was just me but I felt that the noodles weren't chewy enough for me oh and I sadly realized only after finishing the entire thing that they missed a topping on my ramen which was the aosa-nori...but too late 'w' will come back to try ramen with pork and their lunch special combo!"}
{"text":"I like the spicy garlic ramen here because it appeals to my love of spicy food and my obsession with garlic. This ramen comes with a huge dollop of fresh garlic on top. I have tried the fatty tonkasu ramen as well and tried belly and shoulder, I prefer the pork belly, but I feel like both cuts can be a little softer.I think overall, all the broths that I have tried are a bit too salty.   There is alwayssss a line here, and I feel like the ramen is not worth the wait with so many other options like Sansotei, Santakou, Raijin etc around. Also it is pretty cramped and loud in there, someone is always bumping into me and that is annoying.    Overall, I think it was a bit over hyped when it first opened,but I am glad for the trend of quality ramen shops opening around Toronto."}
{"text":"Loved this place. I've been hooked every since my first visit and the food, I can say after many visits, is consistent delicious. The Original Pork Ramen is fantastic and their seasoned eggs are so good! Seating is snug, expect to wait in line for a few minutes if you're with a group larger than 2.   They deliver by Foodora and it travels just as well as when served at the restaurant."}
{"text":"Food is ok, but some may like it more, I guess it's a matter of taste. Prices are neither low nor high. Nice atmosphere, friendly staff."}
{"text":"Must go if you like pork soup ramen."}
{"text":"Location: On Yonge smack in between Finch and Sheppard. Northeast corner of Yonge and Empress. There is cheap street parking available and lot parking (About $1-$2 an hour) for regular business hours. After 9pm, it's free. If you're facing north, Kinton is easy to spot, \"KINTON\" in giant capital letters on the side of the unobstructed building. If you're coming south, look for the parking lot before you hit the intersection.  Facility: Fairly small, lots of 2 - 4 people seating. Not much for large groups. Packed and the atmosphere is pretty loud (the amount of people talking over the loud music) The corridor fits only about 10 people before it starts feeling cramped, then you'll have to stand outside. While we were there, the line went outside the building. We were seated at the very front by the windows. It was basically two people sitting across each other at one large table for 8 (directly underneath the air conditioning). It was very cold but they kindly turned off the A/C when I asked. Washrooms are decent.  Food Quality & Price: I ordered the original pork in regular broth with thick noodles. Meat was good, not the best but good. The egg that comes with the pork, was done well (yolky and delicious) but didn't seemed to be marinated all the way through. I was disappointed that the egg didn't come in the Shoyu dish, you have to add extra ($1.50) for it. Still good though and I appreciated that it was a whole egg, not just half. The thick noodles were not as thick as I'd like, but has a decent firmness. I wouldn't call it al dente, but it's not soft or squishy (so depends on your preference). The regular size is a decent portion and I left feeling relatively full. There is no MSG in the broth, and it was simmered with actual pork (no powder). I really liked that Kinton can personlize the bowl for you (light, regular or rich etc).   Service: Food arrived at an average amount of time, wait staff were generally attentive. They did turn off the A/C when I asked. I wouldn't say they've gone above and beyond, but no complaints.  Overall: It seems like Kinton has found the right formula for success. Their ramen is very good, it's authentic, and the quality is definitely the best of the Big Three. For the price, I'd say that the Kinton franchise is probably the best in Toronto, tied with Jyuban in Markham (a mom and pop shop).   They also tap into \"rewards\" and social media which is a good marketing strategy, but I felt it a little gimmicky. You have to demolish off 1000 bowls for $1000 gift card. Every other incentive is pretty much lack-luster. If you finish your soup, they'll take a picture of you and put it up on their instagram.  I am confident in my assessment that out of the Big Three (Santouka, Sansotei and Kinton) that Kinton has the best tasting, best quality, and best value. It's only downside is the size/atmosphere. Packed and always loud, it's hard to hold a conversation. If you just want a calm dinner night, Kinton is not that place. Kinton is energetic and upbeat while Jyuban is relaxed and soothing."}
{"text":"Big fan! Been here quite a few times and will keep coming back.  The pork is delicious, I usually go for shoulder.  They torch the pork right before putting it in the noodles which makes it extra yummy!  Had the spicy garlic ramen - only okay. The scoop of garlic on top is too overpowering. I usually go with the Miso.  The cheese miso is excellent. I also like how you can customize the strength (fat content) of the broth.   The noodles here are perfect, with just enough bite. The toppings are top notch. The only issue is how busy it always seems to be!"}
{"text":"Pleasant service and good food at a great price! This is our go-to spot when we are craving good ramen. However, we find most of the menu items to be a bit bland - there's really only one item that hits it out of the park, and we come back for that same dish every time. Its the spicy garlic ramen with extra meat, with corn, and an egg. Can't go wrong with that! Their drinks and appetizers are also good, but al in all it's a spot where you have to know what's good to have a good meal."}
{"text":"First off, Everyone is calling this the Third Guu, but that is not exactly true. Some people involved with bringing the Guu franchise to Toronto are also involved here. I think that needs to be cleared up. Don't go in expecting a Guu.  Went during the soft opening as a group of five. Staff organizing seating and hosting were phenomenal. We were seated pretty quickly at a long table in the very back with 5 others, Japanese people, not from our party. MY DC's included my SO who lived in Japan for several years and two friends of his from Japan. No one LOOKS 100% Japanese, but 3 of us could speak it. Let this be a lesson to you Japanese table-mates SLAGGING on how I eat my ramen in Japanese. Just because someone doesn't look Japanese doesn't mean they can't understand your \"look at how the white girl eats her ramen like pasta.. and so slow!\"   Aside from the table mates and the friendly but super slow service the ramen was decent. I was expecting to be blown away.. but I wasn't. The broth was not clear and kinda fatty. I get the whole collagen bit.. but I am not sure. A little depth-less.   I ordered the Shiro Ramen, the SO the Shoyu with pork shoulder. The Nori and the seaweed that I added were yummy, the pork shoulder a wee bit on the dry side. My DCs were commenting that the noodles were a little thick.  Otherwise good. Karaage and Gyoza were particularly yummy.   Cheap enough, dinner for 5 (no liquor licence yet) was $80. Hopefully kinks will be worked out in the next couple of weeks, I will be happy to give them another shot."}
{"text":"It was good to see that Kinton still churns out great ramen.  I had the spicy garlic this time.  Man, it was spicy and garlicky, but both in good ways.  The thin noodles were perfectly chewy.  And the chashu pork!  More than a few ramen shops seem to think that any tender slice of pork is chashu, even if they taste like they've been boiled to death.  Kinton's packed a lot of flavour and could stand on their own.  Service was spot on.  We lingered long after our bowls have been cleared and they were OK with that."}
{"text":"This is the second ramen place I visited in toronto and I must say the food is mediocre at best. Ordered the miso ramen with pork shoulders. Pork was a bit tough..not the melt in your mouth tenderness that I had expected it to be. So overall disappointed. Sensotai on dundas is better in my opinion."}
{"text":"Excellent dinner choice for a cold day. The restaurant is a little small with many tables packed in. It's not a big group sort of place since most of the tables are 2-4 people. However the wait is not bad. They serve chicken or pork ramen with the option of doubling the meat, thick or thin noodles, and various additives (spicy. Garlic etc) there are also cool Appetizer options. Be warned that the ramen itself is a very filling meal. If you finish your bowl to the last drop they'll take a photo of you and give you a stamp card. The ramen is excellent though very flavourfull, and the meat is tender. Aps chicken karage and takayaki were excellent but come extremely hot so wait 2 minutes lest you burn your tongue and miss the flavour of your ramen! (Leasson learned the hard way).  service is a little sluggish especially if you're in the corner, you'll need to get a server's attention to top up your drinks."}
{"text":"Delicious!   I ordered the miso ramen ~$10 (3 pieces of meat), my date ordered the Kinton Ramen Pork with Shoyu broth ~$13 (has 6 pieces of meat) and we both had regular broth + shoulder meat (still tender, not dry at all). Shoyu broth was light - I expected salty for a soy sauce broth but it turns out the miso is saltier and heavier.   Decor is down to earth. You will be sitting very close to the person next to you. Not great for chatting, more of a quick sit down place for delicious ramen. Atmosphere was happening.  Only downside is that it is very busy, unless you go near opening you will be waiting for sure. This is my 3rd time attempting to go (the first 2 times the wait list was 1+ hr) We went on a Monday night at 6, they first told us that it was a 20 min wait but ppl on the waitlist must've left since we got a table 5 minutes into the wait. Lucky us!"}
{"text":"A worthwhile addition to the ramen craze in Toronto right now. Had the shio (strong or whatever, with the pork belly). Broth was good but lacked depth at this price range. Ramen was good as well but had a bit of some soapy/alkali taste to it, but at least I know it's made fresh?  Probably not worth a 1 hr wait, but 30 mins or so is reasonable"}
{"text":"Compare to the number of sushi places in Toronto, ramen shops are far and few in between. So, whenever I learn of a ramen place, I will try my best to go there. This time, it's Kinton Ramen.  First of all, the restaurant is very small. It's best if you go by yourself or with a friend. More than that, you'd have to bet your luck to get one of the few (2?) tables in the restaurant. The rest of the seats are facing either the bar or the kitchen. That said, the decor is nice and very Japanese style. (I actually think that the Japanese restaurants in TO are starting to look very much alike in terms of decor, maybe they all use the same interior design company).   I ordered Shio Ramen with a rich broth and pork shoulder. Kinton is the first ramen restaurant I tried that allows you to choose how rich your broth is and whether you want pork shoulder or pork belly. I was told that the pork belly is a bit fat so I picked the shoulder instead. The broth is okay but the pork shoulder is excellent. The pork is tender and juicy and it reminds me of the pork I had when I travelled in Japan. The noodles are chewy but a tad firm for my taste. I also ordered Spicy Karaage which turned out to be surprisingly good. So, to conclude, their meat is better than their noodles and their broth.  Overall, I would give it a 3.5 stars and I wouldn't mind going back again."}
{"text":"The best and most authentic Japanese Ramen in Toronto. Yes, in Toronto.   When it comes to Japanese food, you can't really compare Toronto to other cities with huge Japanese population like New York. We don't even have a decent Japanese supermarket or J Town here.  I've tried quite a few Ramen places in Toronto and Kinton, in my opinion is the best by far. It's not just the food but it's the atmosphere and the staffs."}
{"text":"The spicy chicken app was delicious. Juicy and saucy but not very spicy. The service was good/fast and the restaurant is clean and funky looking. The ramen however was disappointing. We got the spicy garlic ramen with pork belly any it was meh. Very garlicky (they add a scoop of fresh minced garlic) but but not spicy or incredibly flavourful. Aijisen down the street has a much more delicious, rich spicy pork broth. I personally like this spicy thai ramen broth. And my overall favourite ramen place still remains Kenzo (not the franchise one but a small mom & pop restaurant with the same name) near Yonge & steeles. There are way more extras like dumplings, egg, sweet pickled radish side dish, etc... and they're free!"}
{"text":"Having lived in Japan for 5 years, in Toronto this is the most reminiscent of Tokyo place to get ramn. Period. If you're hungry, be sure to order extra noodles when you place your order and go for the shoulder cut over the pork belly as it's much easier to eat. The Gyoza = perfect, and the staff are really friendly and polite. They make the best spicy-garlic ramen in town."}
{"text":"The overall experience for this restaurant was pretty great. When I first entered I definitely felt welcome and really inspired by their layout. It felt like I was actually in Japan, but with a modern twist. The service was pretty nice, especially with the chefs. It looked like they were having a lot of fun cooking the food.  The food itself is pretty good. What I ordered was a ramen combo, extra pork original with age gyoza and iced tea. The pork, egg and seaweed tasted great, but it felt as if the broth needed something more than just sea salt. The age gyoza was the highlight for me. It had that perfect balance of spice and sweet.   Overall I give it a 4/5, because while I enjoyed everything else, service and layout included, the ramen felt like it was lacking. I might come back here though to taste their other choices of ramen (and for the age gyoza!)."}
{"text":"Came here twice! Once with hubby & once with girlfriend~ absolutely love their fatty pork shoulder slice with the classic pork bone soup base!   My girlfriend and I loves fatty meat, so we order the $15.99 combo which gives us extra 5 slices to share~"}
{"text":"Very tasty ramen. The vegetable ramen is packed with a lot of vegetables. Lot of raw garlics! Ok...it may be a little too much raw garlic for a first date but you have the option to remove it, as it is placed like a garnish on top of your ramen.   Not a place for big group...unless you don't mind waiting."}
{"text":"Hm noodle textile is very good.  Pork shoulder  a bit over cooked, may be by the burner.   The egg white is tender and the yolk running except it is cold.  The soup I ordered thick comes with lot of lard bits, really heavy.  Though it is good, I still prefer Sansotei on Dundas"}
{"text":"Still a lot of people waiting for seats even it is almost two o'clock, so i have to say it is popular. Thin noodle is a little bit hard, the broth is too fatty for me I can see the fat in the soup, and very salty, so I didn't drink it at all. I ordered two additional toppings, sweet corn and seasoned egg but the forgot to put egg in it... As appetizer I ordered Takoyaki, the ball itself is good but the sauce is too sour and if I were them, I will add some sugar to balance the sour and the salt. Will go again to try their Karaage."}
{"text":"Usually long lines are the indication that something is worth trying out or maybe it just means it  overhyped. After waiting 20 minutes in line, I was waiting to be impressed but the ramen did fall short. Kinton Ramen known for their social media, left me wondering if that is the reason why they are so popular. Personally, Sansotei is better. The broth is more thicker but too oily and although the taste is nice, it was just way too salty for me to appreciate it. The noodles were definitely undercooked and the meat was dry. There are better ramen places in Toronto."}
{"text":"i didn't want to have high hopes when i came cause everyone loooves it, but now i can see why. it is definitely, in my eyes, one of the best ramen places in toronto. the bowls are really big so you get a lot for your money, you get a good portion of noodle, veggies and meat which is better than some of the other ramen places. i also finished the whole bowl so i can get a picture taken. hehe. overall, it was a really good experience. just a word of caution, it does get pretty warm in there cause it's so small and people are cooking right there"}
{"text":"The Shoyo ramen is quite good, and I really like their seasoned egg with the nice soft yolk centre.  The rich broth with shoulder is very good.  Basically, the food is good and the portions are decent.  The gyoza was okay, not the best.  The problem with the place is that it is too small, and most seating are on counters.  Wait time to sit can be very long, and the food also takes a long time to arrive when they're busy.  The loud music makes it hard to talk with the people you're eating with."}
{"text":"Food is good .Service is okay ... Music is wayyyy too loud. I normally don't complain but it was a little excessive with the music . I would definitely come back but would really love if they turned the music down a bit."}
{"text":"If you like ramen that hits you right in the flavorplexes this is the one for you. They do the customary yelling at you when you enter and they have chicken ramen aka bird noodle soup which is rare and taste. We also tried both the standard and spice-doggy karaage (fried chicken) which are both worth their weight in chicken, and they have an amazing loyalty program called Kinton bowlers so you can bowl out of control and earn cool prizes like a towel or a 1000$ gift card (if you spend the equivalent of aprox $14k there on 1000 bowls but who am I to judge)"}
{"text":"3 words - too much hype.   I was recommended Kinton Ramen by a lot of people since the owner of Guu opened it (and I do like Guu).   We waited 1.5 hours to be seated in the restaurant, which felt like a small sized locker room. We sat by the bar and the chairs had no backs, so there was no place to put our jackets. It was also summer when we went, so it was really hot inside.   I ordered the Shoyu Ramen with the regular broth and pork shoulder since the waitress said the pork stomach has a lot of fat. The ramen was good, but I was shocked at how heavy the \"regular\" broth was. It was too salty for my liking and was really oily - I would try the light broth next time. The portions are quite large. If you finish a full bowl (including the soup), you get a neat certificate!  I agree that Kinton's food itself is good, but having to eat in a sweaty locker room after being starved for 1.5 hours was not the best experience. I'll consider returning in the Winter."}
{"text":"Kinton Ramen makes its mark on the eclectic strip of Baldwin Village We made it to the soft opening this past Tuesday. Literally 10 minutes after getting seated the place was already packed!   Environment :  Communal seating rules here so get comfortable with close proximity dining. Talk amongst your friends perhaps makes new dining companions nearby. ;)   The narrow restaurant is dominated by a long reaching bar and kitchen.   We lucked out and got some prime seats by the open kitchen. And if you're foodie, this is 'the place' you want to be seated at. It's where the magic happens. Everyone in the kitchen busy doing something, whether whisking, pouring oils, cooking/cutting the noodles, blowtorching, frying, the manager himself was stirring two large silver pots of  broth with the largest ladle I've ever seen!!   Food:  There are some appetizers and salads available. But for us the main attraction was the ramen. So we ordered just that that night.  There's a few soup bases to select from; Miso (soy bean paste), Shio (sea salt), Shoyu (soy sauce), and Spicy (chili pepper)  I went with Kinton Pork Ramen with a miso soup base - this is a noodle soup with healthy helping of MEAT.  (pork shoulder and pork belly (bacon).   About 10 minutes later my soup arrived. It was large and in charge and looking the part.    Armed with chopsticks and wooden ladle I began my feast.   Broth consisted of a combination of miso +pork broth, golden color and oily  The noodles were cooked perfectly and had a nice chewy texture The soup was topped with corn, bean sprouts, and diced red onions this added a nice texture and aroma.  The meat oh yes the meat I alternated between the shoulder which a bit leaner and the pork belly (bacon) which was fattier tastier and saltier.  I prefer the bacon in the end.  There were also small pieces of pork from the soup base if I didn't have enough meat already.   My thoughts:  I liked it. The soup was fresh, tasty but a bit salty. It meets your quota for protein and sodium that's for sure.   After we finished  Aki, the manager of Kinton came over to talk which was cool.    In summary, Kinton delivered a tasty bowl of ramen in a cheerful and friendly environment with a slight ringing to your ears."}
{"text":"Went to Kinton & I must admit I didn't really know what I was doing. But it was cold out, and I was so hungry. I had the spicy garlic broth & thin noodles with pork belly. It was very tasty & I did enjoy it, but do wish that the staff would have helped me order (because I saw what others were eating & it looked more appealing to me). Regardless, it was delicious, and priced exceptionally well. Will go again for sure."}
{"text":"I've had better but I do have to say their tacowasa hit the spot. But we did come for the ramen and i was disappointed.  The service, however, is great."}
{"text":"Consistent. The pork belly is soft and juicy, shoyu is good. ... it's also really close to my work so it's so damn convenient."}
{"text":"You can do take away from this place! Yes! Even their ramen. Lets start with the good first...  -Pork based with miso broth ramen: Good. I added fried tofu and omg was it ever delicious! Their fried tofu is heaven! Must add on!! I chose the thicker noodles and i didn't regret my decision. They were not over cooked what so ever. Just perfect. I am not sure what toppings originally come with their ramen but i am pretty sure its pork...spring onion...and bean sprouts.  -takoyaki:  as legit as it gets! So many japanese restaraunts over cook the damn things by deep frying it but not here! The batter is crispy and soft on the inside with a little bit of octopus. It's covered in fish flakes, mayo, and a sauce similar to tonkatsu sauce.  Delicious and highly recommend!  The cons of their food: -all add ons are expensive! I added corn, tofu, garlic oil (i couldnt even taste it...nor did i see it in my soup...) seasonal vegetables almost for 9$ extra!! Ouch!!! -the broth made my blood pressure sky rocket only after a few gulps and now i suffer a big headache. -way too expensive for what it is. My total was 30$!! I didn't eat the pork cause i don't eat that but it smelled so bad. Like a wet dog smell!!   Over all, do i recommend this place? If you really want ramen regardless of the price...then yes. Would i go back? Not really unless it was to pick up the takoyaki as a snack.  3/5"}
{"text":"Excellent, fast and friendly service.  The pork miso ramen is always a favorite of mine."}
{"text":"Expect a wait - the place is small and everyone still wants their ramen fix.  Got the shio ramen and gyoza.  If you sit near the noodle bar, the people will be yelling when people come in/leave - similar to Guu Izakaya.  This is probably my second favourite ramen place in Toronto, after Santouka.  Oh, and the washrooms are surprisingly clean and modern.  Do yourself a favour  and check them out.  There's mouthwash too!"}
{"text":"This place has amazing skewers which range from chicken thigh to tiger shrimp in butter to meatballs filled with cheese. Every time I have been here the service has been good and the food is always fresh off the grill!"}
{"text":"I prefer to try a place out twice before reviewing, trying to avoid the first time bias effect. I've notice that with the second trying of kinton. Their food doesn't stick it as much as it did the first time.  The vegetarian spicy option is good but doesn't stand out in any regard and if anything feels a bit over salted and heavy considering it was also a light broth.   The atmosphere is great however which makes up for the slight drop in food appeal. The staff are attentive without being overbearing and they work hard to ensure timely seating. A big bonus if you can sit by the kitchen and see the chefs in action!  A solid three, though with some many new ramen and izakayas opening it will be hard to tell how long it remains at that level."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious. Ordered the spicy garlic ramen and the chicken ramen, would recommend both of them."}
{"text":"Very delicious ramen and takoyaki. This place has a really cool interior design and a great metropolitan vibe. I recommend going on a Monday when they have their spicy shogun ramen special. Tasty food for a good price!"}
{"text":"I give this place four stars for the food and two stars for the protracted service.  When we went it was not even busy and yet it still took the waiter more than 10-15 minutes to come to us (after I flagged him down)  the food then proceeded to take almost 20 minutes which again seemed insane to me given that they were not that busy.  The ramen here is very good however, and the the craft beer tall boy special is also a great deal.  I ordered the spicy garlic pork ramen which I would recommend to any garlic lover.  However, do not plan to attend any social events immediately afterwards!  If they can get it together in terms of service, this could definitely become a go-to place."}
{"text":"I'm going to review this by not comparing it to any ramen places because frankly I haven't tried enough places in Toronto nor have I had authentic Japanese ramen from Japan to make a judgement.   I ordered the Miso Ramen with the rich broth and the pork belly. What I got was tons of lard in my broth, veggies, (what looked and tasted like) extremely salty meat, and one slice of pork fat. The noodles were subpar. The soup was a mix of grease with a hint of miso. I just felt very sick after my meal knowing how much animal fat I consumed.  I did enjoy the atmosphere and the decor inside. Our waiter who was also the bartender was very kind and helpful. The hostess outside was a little bit inconsistent on how she was doing her job. When we put our name down, she would call poeple in front the restaurant and even cross the street to ask people. At one point she stopped doing that, and went through the list so quickly she skipped our name. We just went inside the restaurant and told her we put our name down and haven't been seated yet and we got a seat right away.   All in all, I wasn't impressed and I highly doubt be returning."}
{"text":"My ramen was bursting with flavour! I ordered the spicy garlic pork ramen and added a seasoned egg and seasoned veggies. The broth was rich and spicy, and there was a huge pile of fresh garlic on top. The pork was tender and flavourful. And that egg! It was not a boring old boiled egg. The portion is huge so come hungry. For the amount of food you get, the price is point is very good. I also had the spicy karaage chicken which was really tasty.   The staff is friendly and everyone yells whenever someone enters or leaves, so it is quite noisy. It's also small so try to come at an off time to avoid waiting for a seat. On a Wednesday at 6:30 there was a line at the door!    I've had ramen at a few different places and this has been my favourite by far! I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Kinton is the perfect place to go when you have a ramen craving. You're better off going before 5pm or after 8:30. This location is so small, and the wait time can go upwards of 45 minutes, in a small holding area you won't have room to stand in."}
{"text":"Maybe I had too high of expectations for a real ramen place from Vancouver! But no...this place recreated the atmosphere but not the food quality.  Broth was full of salt - the light one was much more bearable but still more salt than flavour. The noodles were too al dente and not cooked enough. And the pork belly, way too much quantity and thickness over quality pork belly.  So I really liked the chicken karaage. And the place itself. Maybe over time it will be better. I don't think the lineup is worth it and won't be going back anytime soon.  To be fair it was okay - the portion is huge and the staff is super accommodating and friendly. I was just hoping for some kintaro and santouka equivalent from the west coast."}
{"text":"Not worth the line-up and the fad.  Soup base was fatty and salty.  I'd opt for the other japanese restaurant several stores down which has more variety and tastes better."}
{"text":"My partner and I enjoyed some pork and chicken ramen, respectively on a very chilly night this week. Chicken broth was delicious and full bodied, noodles tender and chicken so juicy. I ordered original and loved the forward flavour of the nori. Pork was fatty and rich. If you want it a little lighter go for the pork shoulder.   Kimchi and gyoza are good - nothing mind blowing, but good.   Service was speedy, though we waited a long time for plates to be cleared and to pay our bill.   I think the Baldwin location does a better job at creating their original, fun vibe but the ramen stacks up.   Great, hearty meal on a cold night."}
{"text":"The service here is terrible. We were the only non-Asian customers in the restaurant and were made to feel it at every turn. We had to wait over 30 minutes for someone to take our order. Our order ticket was somehow repetedly relegated to the back of the queue so people who arrived 30 minutes after us we served well before us. In the end, when we got up to leave, the manager finally acknowledged us and promised to bring the food over in 5 minutes. 20 minutes later, we finally got to eat.  The food was quite good but the racist service was so poor that I will never go to this restaurant again."}
{"text":"Been to every single Kinton in the city. This one is the newest and when I ate here a few months ago when it just opened, it was pretty bad. Like a 2 star. And the other Kintons deserved a 4 in my books. I've been another 2 times since that bad experience, and it's picking up. I ordered the spicy garlic ramen last night. It was up to normal Kinton standards. I usually get the light broth, pork belly ramen. So I can't comment on the appetizers or chicken ramen.  Bottom line is if you're in the area, this is a decent, budget choice."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and have loved the food. The atmosphere is great with all the staff yelling what I assume are orders, and the decor is very modern and nice.  I have had the pork ramen with spicy garlic broth and have really enjoyed it both time I have ordered it."}
{"text":"I think I've reviewed another Kinton location negatively before. The bloor location has a weird ambience: half intricate wood wall and half boring slate tile job. Lights were too high for late at night. Bathrooms were dirty. I ordered the ramen with miso broth and chicken. Broth was good, thick noodles were el dante, but the chicken was limp and tasteless. I left it in the bowl. There's lots of places better than this."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Kinton. They play Shima Uta (Muzak version) non-stop downstairs. The Kinton jerseys and other official gear the staff rock are awesome. The food here is not healthy. Drink a beer with your ramen in order to mitigate salt overdose. You may require multiple beers. Enjoy life."}
{"text":"good place. good ramen. good waiter and waitress. ramen combo is very good. especially the side food! definitely will go again!  but beer is 4.99$ at friday. maybe next time will go there at weekdays"}
{"text":"Oily and salty soup, long wait time.  Totally not worth it!  There was tons of fat in the soup and it was so salty and we waited for more than 1 hour.  Totally not worth the hype."}
{"text":"Just to put it out there, I am not a ramen person. I've been to all the ramen places in Toronto and have sworn off ramen from my diet. They all tasted like MSG. The only reason I wanted to come here was because it is opened by Guu (I love Guu), and it's close to my work.  I arrived at 12:15 for lunch. I read some people say you must go when they open to get a seat. We just walked in and were seated right away by the door. Throughout the entire meal, I didn't see anyone wait longer than 10 minutes. I don't think it's a big problem during lunch hour.  The second you walk in you know it's a sibling of Guu, the wait-staff yelling their face off gave it away. The atmosphere is also very similar. It's a small restaurant tucked in my favourite baldwin street.   I ordered their pork special one with extra meat (prok belly) with soy soup. My friend got the spicy garlic with pork shoulders. Her soup was really good, the spice gave it a nice kick. Mine was delicious as well, a little too oily though, but still very good.  The noodles are just right, not too soft like some other places.  Overall, if I ever want ramen, this is the place I would go to. To me, I think this is the best Ramen place in Toronto. I am curious to try their side dishes as well."}
{"text":"The ramen serving was really fulfilling and there was a good amount of meat but the soup was a bit too salty to try and finish it."}
{"text":"First time at this now Toronto institution. I know there's much back and forth about the best ramen place in Toronto, and I have to say, I haven't had ramen anywhere else but here. And it was great. It was cold AF today, and so when we walked past the huge line at Hokkaido on Dundas, we just kept on walking up Church to Kinton where there was just another couple in front of us. We were seated fairly quickly, and ordered the following:  - a mini Sapporo, a cocktail called Gold (cocktail was weak but refreshing - would not get again) - edamame (very well salted, maybe even slightly over, addictive as edamame tends to be) - an order of the original chicken ramen with thin noodles (my husband's order, he loved it, he said he could \"die in this broth\") - an order of the original chicken ramen with thin noodles +  jalapeno paste. The broth was rich and hot, albeit a little salty, and there was a generous amount of noodles. It came with two pieces of chicken breast, some nori, green onions/white onions, some sliced jalapeno + jalapeno paste, and a seasoned egg. I'm glad I added the jalapeno paste, because I think I would have been bored halfway through the bowl otherwise. The seasoned egg though was KEY - I will always add this on to my order and I would recommend you do too. Overall, it was great, warmed my soul.  Service was a little slow, but I won't ding them too much for that, since they got super busy as soon as we got seated. The staff does send you off with a loud greeting, izakaya style, which is always fun.  TLDR: saltier than I like/expected it to be, addition of jalapeno paste + seasoned egg made the ramen SO much more enjoyable. good ration of broth to noodles. served piping hot as it should be."}
{"text":"I've been to a few Kinton locations. I've been specifically to this one twice. This time I had the ice cold ramen which I really enjoyed. The concept is great for summer days when the last thing people want to eat is a hot bowl of soup with their noodles. I would also say that this ramen solves the one major problem I have with Kinton which is how salty their broth is. The slush broth of the ice cold ramen is sweeter and less salty than the traditional broth. It also comes with more toppings than the traditional ramen however the portion is on the small side and you can't replace it in their lunch combo to get a free side. I would say if you are looking to try an innovative ramen, give the ice cold ramen a try. The Kinton ramen also comes with fewer ingredients than other places I've been to with a minimal amount of toppings. Of course you can pay for add-ins but that quickly increases the price of your ramen.   Pros - cool slush ramen Cons - salty broth in the normal ramen, small portions."}
{"text":"Great great restaurant! Good service, great food. Highly recommend their original ramen. Sooo tasty! Will come back next time!"}
{"text":"Love their shoyu ramen with runny yolk soy marinated egg. Tried the cheese and garlic ramen, but did not like it one bit. Good but overpriced gyoza. Good Japanese beer selection.  Only cons: overpriced for the amount of time I had to stand in line on the cold. You can't wait inside because the place is too small."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! Every bowl is delicious. They have monthly special bowls at each location and they take photos of you holding an empty bowl in triumph for their website!"}
{"text":"This is by far the worst ramen I've had.  The broth is thick and soooo greasy.  The noodle is overcooked and the pork is tough.  I also got ton-ton don for my toddler, which she typically likes, and it was cold and tasteless. Terrible!"}
{"text":"After we watched the movie\" Tampopo\"a couple month ago, we just cannot help to come down here to try a ramen. Ordered their original ramen with thick noodle and I have to say, overall, friendly service but I just was not fun of the soup. Its extremely greasy for my taste although their boiled egg was pretty decent."}
{"text":"I've been here several times for dinner. I usually go for the pork shoulder ramen with extra meat, which is a great option since most ramen places are pretty stingy. All the soup bases are pretty good, but I'd suggest the medium broth (it's just right). It tends to be very busy and steamy inside, but every so often you might catch a lull where there's no line up. This is probably the best ramen in the area, as long as you don't mind potentially waiting 20-30 minutes for a table."}
{"text":"Chicken karrage - dark brown and smelled burned. Perhaps they need to change their oil? But of course when I tell the waitress that it doesn't taste very good - she just says \"ok\" lol Not worth paying 15 bucks for this especially because you will be thirsty as hell afterwards!"}
{"text":"Amazing Ramen! I always come back here for the chicken ramen and my fiancé always gets the pork ramen with extra pork. Staff and service are great!"}
{"text":"Myself and my wife came here in November from NY for Lady Gaga concert.   I think they were ready to close but they let us in.   The menu was in two column.  1) broth Pork or Chicken Ramen 2) flavor . Original, Shoyu,Miso, and Spicy 3) Noodle thick o thin . 4) various options.  I got Pork+Original+Thick+no extra.  This did come with egg, pork and nori.  It was delicious to the last drop.  We also got Gyoza(with some nice sauce on top)  and Spicy fried chicken(this had Korean pepper sauce a plus in my view).  Sapporo draft beer.  Fantastic upbeat atmosphere; great food and the whole team, the waitress, head waiter and the cook were all working in one unison.  I think they all said thank you and bye in Japanese as we were leaving.  Wow.  We did come back two days later, it was little more busy.  We tried the spicy.   Spicy didn't include the egg like the original but when I asked for it. They brought it over right away.  Great food and great service."}
{"text":"They don't take reservations so it's basically a gamble how long you'll have to wait to get a seat. The place isn't big, probably seats 20-30 people. We went at 6:30pm on a Thursday night and ended up waiting for 20 minutes. Anything later or on a weekend would be a much longer wait!  Japanese cuisine is pretty well known for its appetizers so we decided to order the fried chicken (original Karaage). It was well flavoured and perfectly deep fried without feeling too oily and greasy. If you do feel it's too greasy, there's a bit of vegetable that you can counter the fried chicken with. It was still hot and crispy when it came to our table.   here's a variety of ramen that you can choose from such as spicy, cheese, vegetable etc but we decided to go with the more traditional ramen; miso ramen! When you order, you can choose whether you want your broth to be light, medium or heavy. We both chose to go with the medium. You also have the choice between pork belly and pork shoulder. I decided to go with the pork belly and Monica decided to get the shoulder.  The first taste of the ramen brought me back to Japan where I was lucky enough to try out Ippudo and Ichiran; two of their top ramen joints. The broth is packed with flavour. However, after eating more of the ramen and the soup it ended up tasting very heavy and it was getting a bit difficult to finish the oil. A better option might have been to opt for the lighter broth.  The Japanese culture is infamous for their hospitality and service level and Kinton is no exception. The staff were extremely friendly. However, don't expect to sit long and chat because it seems you are expected to finish up your noodles and then head out so they can maximize the use of their space."}
{"text":"if you can find a Kenzo Ramen shop, GO THERE INSTEAD. I'm surprised the food was so disappointing since they have so many locations! Got the pork shoyu ramen and the spicy karage. The karage was pretty bland the \"spicy sauce\" was ketchup and it was a small portion for the price. The actual ramen doesn't come with a lot on it, i mean charging people for hot sauce and scallions really?? Cheap move. The broth was flavourless apart from the intense saltiness and the \"thick noodles are not the way to go. The pork had a weird texture. I've had way better..."}
{"text":"Had the Spicy Garlic Ramen with Extra meat, Miso Pork Ramen with added seaweed , and some Spicy Karaage.  Love the Spicy Garlic Ramen.  Miso Pork was just ok.  I prefer the Ramen here over Sansotei, Kyouka, and Kiu.   I'd say this is the best Ramen in Richmond Hill/Markham right now.  I didn't have the same service issues as others.  My only complaint is that it was a little pricey.  Will visit again"}
{"text":"Kinton Ramen was the only late ramen shop that was open. Stopped by to grab a quick warm bowl of ramen.  Ordered the original pork ramen with thin noodles. The broth was very good, had a strong flavour of pork, the thin noodle was also very good but, I wish it was a bit more Al dente (by the end of the bowl the noodle was too soft), the pork has a very good char to it, they gave two pieces one is lean and the other is fatty. Wish I asked for two fatty pork. the char makes it very delicious.    Brought my coworker here for his first bowl and ramen and he really enjoyed it! So i highly recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"This is a nice ramen spot that I've been to a few times and will probably return to in the future. This location in particular is fairly small without being too cramped, although if you're carrying any large bags with you, it might be awkward trying to find a spot to store it while you eat.  The servers are all very friendly and accommodating, speaking both English and Japanese.  The ramen comes quickly within 5-10 minutes, and is very tasty, perhaps a bit on the salty side depending on the broth (I've had the spicy garlic, pork, and shoyu broths). The noodles and meat are well cooked.  If you finish your ramen off to the last drop of broth, you will be given a \"Bowler's\" card that will entitle you to certain freebies after finishing 10, 30, 50, etc. bowls of ramen."}
{"text":"Deeply satisfying ramen. They have a wide range of flavours and choice between thick or thin noodles. The serving size is generous, and I left full and happy. Service is fast and professional. The small space fills up quickly! But if you wait a few minutes you'll get a seat."}
{"text":"Great location love the ramen. Literally never had a bad experience at any kinton location. Everytime I come here o know I will get the best possible ramen and the greatest service"}
{"text":"If you don't like ramen you have something wrong with you. this is an excellent location great staff and amazing ramen"}
{"text":"Amazing staff. Great food was considering going for chicken but decided that it is pork all he way. They even listened to my terrible jokes and didnt make me feel completely awkward"}
{"text":"Delicious!!   This os one of the top places in Toronto. I was licking my lips all the way home.........  Ramen is Japanese  soul food.."}
{"text":"I would normally have given this place a 3/5 stars, but on Yelp 2/5 means \"Meh. I've experienced better\", and, well I have, so I can't lie about it, and this is really how I felt after leaving this place. I liked it, but I did not love it. I normally eat at a place several times before feeling like I'm ready to give it a review, but with one visit to this place, I am already decided.  This place is fine, service is fine, it's a clean joint, japanese-owned and operated, can't say more, this place is really correct, if you want to go eat there, fine. It's just that I've eaten at other places before, and I was not enchanted by the taste of my ramen here. I had an original ramen with extra pork in it, it was good, but it lacked that pzazz I got when I had eaten at Sho Ryu ken or at Ryu's. Hence, I know that I can get better, more satisfying and flavorful ramen at those places, which is why I can ignore Kinton from now on after having tried it. The food here just tastes rather regular, it really lacks sparkle, so it's hard for me to recommend when you have so many other addresses around this place that have more items on the menu and do a better job at it. The only reason you would want to come here is if it's the only spot with available seating, otherwise you need to consider the competition first over Kinton."}
{"text":"We came here on a Monday around 9 and had their special Chicken Karage ramen. They sat us next to the bar and they had recently cleaned. I could barely breathe from the smell of their disinfectant. I haven't been to Kinton in years so I wasn't expecting it.   It also seemed like it took a really long time to get our food, and that people who had ordered after us got their food first - but I was hangry so I might not have had the best judgment.   Food-wise - broth was fairly plain and there were very few ingredients to round things out. Noodles weren't my favourite either. I poured a bit of my friend's spicy broth into mine and it upped the flavour immensely. I left wishing I'd just gotten pho.  I'm not writing Kintono off yet - I'm definitely going to try a different location, or at least go on a different day at a different time, but for now I'm just going to take a break from ramen."}
{"text":"Restaurant: Kinton RamenCuisine: Japanese Location: Baldwin Village Address: 51 Baldwin Street Price Range: $10~15  1: Poor 2: OK 3: Good 4: Very Good 5: Excellent  Food: 4  Service: 5 Ambiance: 3 Overall: 4  Extra information:  * Open for lunch and dinner * Soup is pork-based  There could have not been enough raves and articles on Kinton ramen opening in May. It was all over foodie websites as well as twitter, there was no way to avoid it even if you wanted to. Although personally I don't love or crave ramen on regular basis, it is good to have once in a while as a comfort food.  Going to a ramen place on a hot summer day didn't really make sense to me, but with all the hype around it- I had to check it out.  First time I went to Kinton Ramen, I had the Shio Ramen and tried my friend's Cheese Ramen. Unfortunately I didn't have my camera with me at the time so this blog is based on my second visit. Make sure to go within 30 minutes of opening for lunch or dinner, if not expect to wait around minimum 20 minutes up to an hour.  I arrived for lunch around 11:40 (Lunch starts at 11:30) and my mom and I were the last ones to be seated.  Keep in mind that whichever ramen you choose, you get to choose between regular or light broth. Also, for the meat you can choose between pork belly or pork shoulders  Ordered: Kimchi 4/5  * Bowl of fresh Kimchi for $3 * Kimchi is a Korean dish but is sold at a lot of Japanese ramen places * This goes very well with ramen  * First time I ordered this wasn't very good but the second time it was well done * Kimchi is something that could be inconsistent since they ferment over time  Ordered: Miso Ramen 3/5  * Soybean paste, kinton pork, beansprout, onion, scallion, corn, garlic oil for $9.50 * Added seasoned egg for extra $1.50 * Picked regular broth and pork shoulders * If you choose pork belly, they give you one piece versus if you pick pork shoulders, they give you 2 piece * Soup is strong in terms of soybean paste flavor, but quite light in broth * Even with the pork fat, the broth wasn't overly heavy or salty * Noodle is very chewy and bouncy (the way it's suppose to be) * Pork shoulder is fatty enough and goes well with ramen * Seasoned egg that I added to my ramen was perfectly done with runny yolk in the middle  Ordered: Spicy Garlic Ramen 4/5  * Chili pepper, kinton pork, beansprout, onion, scallio and fresh grated garlic for $9.80 * Added seaweed for extra $1 * Picked light broth and pork shoulders * This comes with a blob of grated garlic on top, I found it to be a little too much and removed half of it * Broth is quite spicy with chili pepper and fresh garlic * The spiciness of the broth doesn't linger on your tongue * Very rich in terms of flavor, but again light in broth * Note that seaweed is fresh seaweed, not the dry kind (nori)  Service is excellent at Kinton Ramen. Staff is friendly although some of them don't speak perfect english and I over heard a table next to mine having some communication issues but I never found it to be a problem.  Keep in mind that if you get one of the seats near the back of the restaurant, it does get super hot and you will walk out with sweat dripping down your forehead. Summary: There is no doubt Kinton Ramen is much better in terms of taste and quality compared to Kenzo. One of the biggest difference is in their ramen (noodles) and you will def be able to tell the difference. As I said, ramen is not something I have particular love for- but it's good once in a while. Now I know if I was ever craving one, I will be going to Kinton for sure."}
{"text":"Trendy and fun little place. It's cool to watch them prepare the ramen in front of you. Good food, good atmosphere."}
{"text":"Very nice relaxing experience  I had the spicy chicken Raman and It was very good :) The service was nice and very helpful  I want more now..."}
{"text":"The ramen here is good but not incredible. Ichifuku ramen and Imadake are just down the street from here and it's cheaper and better. I had the original pork ramen, all the ingredients were fresh and good, flavors complimented eachother and the portion sizes were good."}
{"text":"I could only say its good enough. I won't say better than other place.. if u asked me, what it made me only give 3 stars out of 5. Because you have to pay extra for the sides... like corn, nori, egg, and seaweed. I rather go to STC to get a better ramen for a lesser price. But thank you for accomodating us."}
{"text":"Really like this place. Service is good too. I ordered regular soup with thick noodle and pork shoulder, taste so good. They also have combo to order now. I usually get takoyaki on side. By the way, the seasoned egg is highly recommended!"}
{"text":"The ramen is okay, not the best but better than a lot of other places. The service is great, the atmosphere is cute - the way everybody greets and welcomes you. This isn't the first place I would recommend for ramen but it is a lot better than Ajisen Ramen."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is nice and the staff are friendly. That said service was slow, they got my order wrong and insisted that thin and thick noodles look the same."}
{"text":"I've heard a lot about Kinton Ramen as visitor to Toronto and was glad to try it out at least once, though not in the downtown location.  There was a short 15 minute wait for a Saturday evening dinner.    I got a ramen set that came with a choice of side and ramen.  Prices here are actually not bad, but that might be because I'm from NYC and am used to paying ridiculous prices for food anyways.  As my side, I chose the takoyaki and actually really liked it.  It was hot, crispy on the outside and soft on the inside with tender octopus.  The sauce was good.  Then it went a little bit downhill.  I found my spicy garlic ramen to be a little bit tasteless.  I chose the thin noodles instead of the thick because I love the thin ramen; they recommend you choose the thicker noodle with the spicy garlic.  I don't regret my choice - the noodles themselves were fine.  Where Kinton lost some points with me was on the broth.  I LOVE garlic and eat garlic in everything but this broth had way too much minced garlic in it.  I had garlic breath for days.  More importantly than that, however, was the soup (regular richness) had little to no distinction or flavor to it.  It also wasn't salty enough, which I never thought I would say about any ramen restaurant... there's usually TOO much salt.  I paid extra for my egg, and that egg is always worth it.  The pork belly was plentiful and was not too fatty.  Service overall was so-so.  Probably ranks quite low on my ramen restaurants list."}
{"text":"Our favourite ramen place in the city. One of my husband's favourite restaurants in Toronto.  He loves the original broth with pork. I prefer miso with chicken. However, I sometimes find it a bit too salty, and lately find the chicken to be a bit undercooked for my taste. Otherwise, it's great!"}
{"text":"Very good service and great food. I usually get pork ramen with pork belly and thick noodles. The fried chicken is a must try. The portions are small for the fried chicken though. The staff is also friendly and always greets you hello and goodbye. This is always my go to ramen spot."}
{"text":"What impressed me the most is the chewy noodle?When I tasted it, I cannot believe it that is  fully cooked?Maybe just for me, I cannot accept that kind of noodle?I tried the spicy ramen that is unsalted and barely spicy, which is worse than I expected. The spicy karaage and the tofu furai is average."}
{"text":"Was on the way to cheap wing night when we came across this little ramen place. I had briefly heard about this place but I guess they were talking about the downtown location. Luckily we didn't have to wait for long to get a table. So in short, the ramen here is OK at best. It's pretty salty, portions are small and you have to pay extra for a hard boiled egg. The concept is cool but the food (which is why you go out to eat) is just not that good. Honestly, though the ramen wasn't BAD, it's definitely worst I've had."}
{"text":"It's been a couple of years since I visited a Kinton (mainly due to distance), but it was a pretty good experience. I had the miso pork ramen. The pork was thick and pretty tasty. The staff were overall charming and happy to make your experience memorable (including the initiation process of becoming a Kinton Bowler, wooo!)."}
{"text":"pretty good. i liked the miso broth. although i was a little surprised to see that you have to pay extra for the egg, bean sprouts, and a few other items that you would automatically get at other ramen places."}
{"text":"I always come to this location because it's the closest to me. It's also by far the biggest location for all the Kinton locations. It's can get very busy sometimes so I suggest coming a little earlier or later than regular dinner/lunch times. Also parking can be sometimes hectic because of the plaza it's located in has a lot of food. They do also have underground parking too FYI. This kinton is also tucked away in the corner of the plaza facing highway 7. I remember having a hard time locating it.  I know this location has some bad reviews, but I think it was because they are new... but the service is a bit slow here considering ramen places are usually very quick.    The food is always great when I come, but the service quality and speed can be improved. My favourite ramen is always the pork original with thick noodles and I'm always loving their monthly special ramens."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time! Real Japanese gourmet! Wonderful ramen! Highly recommended pork shoulder rich miso ramen~ creamy and Yummy?those staff are very nice and provided traditional Japanese customer service.   P.S The decoration of the store is amazing. And the washroom too. The store have Bose system to play music. Everything is perfect!"}
{"text":"Tried their original pork ramen, original & spicy karaage, takoyaki, edamame, and kinton ball.  The original pork ramen was quite good. The soft boiled egg was pefect and the pork meats were tender. I really liked their original pork soup. It wasn't salty at all so that's a huge plus.  However, they should be giving more soup. I had to inhale lots of noodles to make it look more like \"ramen\" rather than \"yaki\" ramen. The soup was the best part of their meals and it sucked they were being stingy on it. I guess they knew its the best thing they got so that's why they weren't being generous. Also, it said he came with scallions but I hardly saw any. Well.. not a good look.  Their original karaage was alright but nothing to write home about. You get 4 giant pieces. As for spicy karaage, they use hot sauce that you get from a convenience store so I wasn't that impressed.  Their takoyaki and edamame were ok as well. Nothing special. I liked that edamame had right amount of salt but I found some rice remains so that kind of threw me off.  I wasn't really impressed with kinton ball. You get one giant ball but it was just not good.  Overall, this place is ok. I might be a returning customer to try out other ramens but I sure wouldn't be craving for other things."}
{"text":"I really love Japanese ramen..Honestly, I'm addicted to it..   Considering the fact that this place was rated as one of the top Japanese ramen in TO,  I really wanted to give them AT LEAST 3 stars no matter what... b/c I had a faith in my fellow yelpers.. WHAT A MISTAKE SMFH   So prior to ordering, I kindly asked them to give me enough broth b/c I  didn't get enough soup base from the Church branch..  (Just take a look at the pics in case you wonder I'm being greedy.. these guys can't even fill in containers.. it's half filled and when you pour them, they look nothing like ramen. They look more like yaki udon, you know what I mean.).  It's all good though..I was like whatever..you guys really cherish your broth that much huh.. it must be amazing right.  So I had a huge expectation from this Baldwin branch right...I mean.. my fellow Yelpers tend to love this place so it's gotta be goooood!! right?  I tried their 3 popular dishes.. the Original, Spicy, and Shoyu..  When I engulfed the Spicy and Shoyu, I'm gonna be honest...they tasted good, \"thick  and rich\" but my stomach was full of grease...... something was just not right. I was like wtf?! I felt like I was gaining at least 20 pounds per dish..   So I was like wtf's going on right..let me investigate..  so, I decided to refrigerate the Original to see what it's actually made out of.. my reaction was \"HOLY F!!!!!!!!\"  Yes, the pictures speak louder than words so just take a look at it man!  What you're seeing is the fat layer on top of the broth... I was too naive to recognize it before stuffing it up into my stomach.. fml... no wonder they tasted RICH..  They didn't filter out fat.... too lazy I must say.. Yeah..that's right..   If you need to gain weight and want to risk your health, this is the place for you... otherwise... get the f out of this overrated joint..  PS: at least they didn't miss any extra toppings so that's a plus.   Will never visit this place"}
{"text":"I came here yesterday with my friend to eat for the first time and I really enjoyed it. The service was fast and they were nice. I ordered the spicy garlic ramen with thick noodles, it tasted good but I wouldn't say it was the best ramen I've had. I loved their karrage chicken! I would totally come back for that. Their appetizers weren't as bad :) 4 stars"}
{"text":"What an awesome place to eat at!!! The workers here were super friendly and they even took a picture of my boyfriend and I and posted it on their Instagram. They were very informative and made my experience there very enjoyable. The broth was rich and creamy and the flavours were perfect.  They have different specials on different days. I'll be sure to come back on a Monday so we can try out the karaage chicken one !"}
{"text":"Slurp. Slurp. Slurp. There's a lot of that from your neighbor, especially with communal seating!  There are some things I noticed that's very Guu about Kinton. * Stupid line ups. * Loudness. It's high energy and fun, but still loud. * Service is good and friendly! * Cramped communal or bar seating. * Those dudes are wearing those headbands...  As for the food, it's not the best bowl of ramen I've had but not the worst either.  They give you the option of pork shoulder or pork belly... more tasty and more fatty, pork belly please.    I was satisfied with the portions, but I would have liked more meat.   The broth wasn't as hot as I would have liked either.  The The Spicy Karaage was crispy and deliciously deep-fried.  Again, not the best I've had, but I'd order it here again.  I would come back here for noodles if I didn't have to line up. Which may not be for a long time!"}
{"text":"Kinton Ramen is by far the best place I have ever been for ramen. The ramen is fresh and you can even see the cooks cooking your order behind the bar counter. Every time they make a fresh batch of ramen, they would yell. The soup is flavourful but they could add a little bit more flair to it. The sliced pork is always a good piece and not you may select from a pork belly (more fatty) vs pork shoulder (less fatty). The egg is done perfectly as it is yellow with a bit runny. The portion is a perfect amount, as you would always leave with a full, filled stomach.  It is a loud vibrant place. Seats are somewhat limited but the wait time is always quick as it is more of an in and out place. You sit and eat and out the door. 20 minutes max for the wait...well worth it. But if you are there in a large group, then yes, the wait may be longer as there is only one large table for a group of 5+ people. For chairs and tables..it is comfortable with wooden seats and table..but when it comes to winter...there is no place to hang your coat at the back of your chair and ladies...no place to hang your purses/ bags. But, they do have a coat rack- which is not ideal.   There is also a Green P (public paid parking) that makes it very convenient as it is located on Yonge Street."}
{"text":"Service was friendly, and energetic. Almost makes me wish that I could work there. I got the Shoyu Pork Belly ramen. Everything was good, just that the broth was waaaaayy too salty. I haven't tried their other flavours but hope they're good!"}
{"text":"Yes!! They finally brought Vancouver ramen to Toronto!!  This place reminds me of Kintaro in Vancouver. Large portions of yummy noodles and broth, and no skimping on the meat.  Unfortunately, I thought the pork belly was only ok - the flavour was good but it wasn't tender enough - so can't give this place five stars, but I really liked everything else. The pork shoulder was amazingly tender and tasty, so I recommend choosing the shoulder over the belly.  The belly seems to come in larger pieces though, so if you're hungry and like to chew your meat, the belly might be more suitable.  The broth and noodles can't be beat in terms of taste, texture, and freshness.  And I love the soft-boiled egg; only authentic Japanese places make the eggs like this, where the whole yolk is somehow still soft and runny.  The decor of the place is really interesting and unique, and pretty much all the seating is at communal bar counters, so you'll most likely be sitting next to your dining companion rather than across from.  It's cool sitting at the bar and watching the guys cook the noodles.  Kinton might be a bit expensive for ramen, but until the competition picks up in Toronto, I definitely think it's worth it for a good bowl of ramen."}
{"text":"The wait time for you to be seated will be hell if you idiots decide to go there during the obvious and busiest time during dinner time (around 6:30 onwards). Considering the fact as well that the restaurant is tiny, obviously it will take some time for them to accommodate your asses.   Luckily, my friend and I weirdly decided to starve ourselves a little and leave a lot of room for a steamy hot bowl of ramen right after work. Work finished at 4, we got to Kinton around 5:30 to 6. We got seated right away in the bar. You don't want to wait? Go early. Simple as that.  If I had to wait, I say the wait would be worth it. Everything was just perfect in my opinion. Well, my experience was. Well, given the fact that I didn't have to wait for anything, hell yeah my experience was amazing! The ramen was just awesome and delicious. My friend ordered the Spicy Garlic Ramen with Pork Shoulder and I ordered the Extra Meat Ramen with Miso broth and Pork Belly. Thinking about it just makes me drool. When they ask you how you would like the broth, do yourself a favour and order the 'RICH' version. If you're gonna eat like fat pig anyway with all that yummy noodles and fatty pieces of pork, you might as well go all the way with it. It's that good. I'm not even exaggerating. I loved it especially with the fact the weather that day was a bit too gloomy and wet (kinda like you're in Vancouver). The ramen ended the day on a good note.  Tips? Go early, probably late. Avoid the rush. Order either kinds of broth (I tried the miso one which is good, if you love garlic then go for the spicy garlic - it will literally punch you in the face with garlic flavour) just make sure you order them 'RICH'.  I definitely will be back, it was that good."}
{"text":"I had the Jalapeño Chicken and it was marvelous! Even better than ramen in Tokyo, because I think this is a new twist on a classic.  Music was crazy loud, and I preferred the old Japanese music playing in the basement washrooms, as opposed to what they were playing in the main area.  Expect to pay around $12-16 each, which is more than ramen in Vancouver, but hey.  The reason I give four, instead of five stars is because the service was only satisfactory. The guy who delivered our ramen was really friendly, but the waitresses were more robotic and not exactly polite, but not rude.  Still, I'd come back because the food was that good."}
{"text":"I visited with my friend for a hearty bowl of pork ramen. It was past lunch time but there were still many people inside so we still had to wait to be seated. There were many options on the menu, and the waitress helped me go through them. The pork ramen I got was alright. The meat was thinner than the last time I visited, and also many toppings were extra, including the egg. I think I enjoyed my meal. If I visit this restaurant again, I may try getting extra toppings."}
{"text":"There was a bit of a wait when I got into the store, but understandable as it was around lunch time.  The seatings were high chairs with minimal space between customers... (I was put into the same table as some other customers) so that was a bit awkward. Although there was a small cutout in the high stool for your bags, there was no space to put your jackets so I had to hang them along with 20+ others on the rack beside the door. I got the shoyu pork ramen with thin noodles. I found the soup to be overly salty for my own taste but the pork slices were very tasty compared to other ramen places.  Overall, good place to satisfy solo craving for ramen, however not a good place to chat/catch up with friends."}
{"text":"Let me preface this by saying that I'm not a ramen lover but Kinton has won my heart and satisfied my belly. As a newcomer to Toronto I wanted to check out the food scene and because my boyfriend is a huge fan of ramen I agreed to try the highly rated Kinton Ramen. And I was not disappointed. I ordered from their Summerlicious menu and got the Pork Gyoza and Chicken Karaage appetizer, the Spicy Garlic Ramen and the Matcha Cheesecake for dessert.  The gyoza was delicious while the karaage was nice but not very flavorful. The ramen was amazeballs. I highly recommend it with the thick noodles. Lastly the matcha cheesecake is what dreams are made of. Perfectly rich and smooth and decadent.  All in all it was a fantastic meal and since there's a Kinton location opening near my place I will definitely be checking it out in the near future."}
{"text":"Tried kinkalicious! Some cool flavours and no lineup. Got spicy pork ramen - you could taste that the noodles were hand-made, great feel. The soup base itself was a bit too salty.  The komi chicken was fresh and tasted great, the slight sweetness of the sauce balances the dish well. Only problem was there was too much sauce, and it pooled at the bottom of the dish.  Pudding was not too sweet, and had the roasted flavour."}
{"text":"You want a satisfying bowl of noodles. This is the place. It's a tiny place, so you might have to wait, as it is busy, but slurping down noodles is done quickly.   We started with the Tofu Furai and the Takoyaki. Came out well seasoned and hot. It was tasty. Something I could eat everyday.   I ordered the Vegetarian Ramen and my friends ordered the Spicy Garlic Pork Ramen.  It came out quickly, flavourful and hot, which noodles and especially the broth should be. It was very satisfying and filling. I was told you eat all the food and drink all the broth - empty bowl - you get a stamp on a card and I don't know how many stamps later, but you get a free meal.   My only issues were the cleanliness of the floor and the washrooms. There is no where to put your purse besides under the seat. It is a wooden stool, but the floor had noodles and napkins on the floor.  The washrooms need a little more attention as well.  Overall, a place to try - they have many locations. The atomsphere was vibrant; however, the staff greeting everyone who came in and left was loud, especially, the staff with high pitched voices.   It's like fingernails scrapping a chalkboard. Nice gesture, don't get me wrong, but it needs to be toned down a little, especially when every five to twenty minutes people are walking into the restaurant and leaving."}
{"text":"Came here the other day with a friendly. place is very friendly and clean the noodles are very delicious . It seems like that they are housemaid the broth was also very thick and creamy extremely delicious the meat was fresh the veggies was fresh we also got the gyoza and that was extremely delicious. I have the garlic Ramen and it was really good I do highly recommend that and the spicy Ramen. The spicy Ramen is my absolute favorite over there and I highly recommended if you do like spicy soups."}
{"text":"This is a review for a delivery order.  The soup arrived a bit cold, but it was not bad.  The dumplings were amazing!  *BUT* With a $4.50 delivery charge + driver's tips (I tipped $4) it cost me $8.50 to have it delivered.  In addition, the soup was rather small, the noodles were nothing special, one square of seaweed, half a chicken breast and one egg = $15?  If you include the delivery fee, I paid $34 for a medium bowl of soup and 5 dumplings.  If I had not received a coupon for $7 off I would not have ordered.  Even with the coupon, I paid $27 for this small meal.  I had to make myself a sandwich after I ate!    Food is NOT worth the money it costs.  Far too expensive."}
{"text":"The pork miso was to die for, service was extremely prompt and very nice and the restaurant itself was very chic and cozy!"}
{"text":"I've gone to 3 different locations for Kinton Ramen. My friends and I were just walking along Church Street. Not going to lie, the only reason why we stopped in was because they had a sign that a pitcher of Sapporo was $9.99. Luckily I was able to convince the others to come in and try some ramen.  Their ordering system is fairly simple. You can choose either chicken or pork, choose the broth, noodles and extras such as seasoned egg, garlic, etc. You can have a combo for $12.99 so you get the ramen and choose from 3 dishes to have with it. I normally get the shoyu broth but it didn't come with an egg! I have to have the egg! Yeah I was being cheap and not paying the extra $1.50. I do prefer the shoyu broth. So I got the original pork ramen with gyoza. I love the pork belly. It's delicious! I used to be able to finish the entire bowl but I guess with old age I can no longer stuff myself like a build-a-bear. It's very filling and you can order extra meat if you're crazy hungry.  If you like getting yelled at upon entering and leaving an establishment (in another language) then this is the place for you! Haha but jokes aside, the staff at all locations have always been very friendly. I need to collect more stamps to get free stuff though!"}
{"text":"One word can sum up this place..  \"GARBAGE\"  Soup was warm at best, flavor was off, portion was small, price is high and I swear I can make instant noodles at home to taste better then this bowl of rubbish...."}
{"text":"Slow. So slow that I have to make for lost time by cutting this review short.  Went here for lunch on a Friday around 1 pm and after being seated, we noticed that the surrounding tables were all waiting for food. It was decided that it would be best to order ramen only. No extras. Nothing. We didn't leave until 2:30. Average broth and average noodles that dire hunger could not bring to superb levels. And the worst part? A medium, borderline hard boiled, uncut egg."}
{"text":"Long after many other ramen places have opened across the GTA, Kinton remains one of my favourites.   Their broth is tasty, allowing you the choice of either light, regular, or rich (rich is where they add pork fat, usually skimmed from the top of the broth while simmering).  You can also choose your noodle thickness in thick or thin, a protein of chicken or a cut of pork (shoulder or belly).  Other or extra toppings like butter, corn, or dollops of spicy grated garlic or jalapeño can be added at roughly $1 each.  The menu provides you with their recommended combinations, but you can pick any ingredient to your liking.  Rest assured that whichever you choose, it will be flavourful. My usual pick is the spicy garlic ramen with pork belly, which is a must-try for any garlic lover. It makes your breath horrifyingly stenchy, but worth it!   Side dishes like takowasabi (small chunks of octopus mixed with grated wasabi alongside nori sheets to wrap it in), Japanese fried chicken, and takoyaki are also available but I prefer the Guu chain for that type of eating as it's more their specialty. By the way, Kinton is owned by the same Kinka family.    You'll be greeted by the same raucous \"Irashaimase!\", may find an equally long lineup depending on the day/time, and friendly service.  On the downside, the lack of space to place your bag or belongings is also an issue here, and with the packed, wooden stool seating it means you're left to carry your things on your lap.    Credit cards are accepted, and prime times are Friday and weekend evenings starting at about 6:30pm-8pm.  If you can finish your entire bowl - every noodle and drop of soup - you will be inducted into the Kinton hall of fame (dubbed Kinton Bowlers) via an Instagram shot and a stamp card, for which you start earning rewards after fully completing 10 bowls. The portions are hefty, but as the tastiness level is high, you may find yourself joining the Kinton Bowlers club quickly."}
{"text":"Maybe because this place is sooo tiny so it just looks packed all the time, but I really don't think it's worth all the hype.  Very mehhh.  Been here twice now - and both times were underwhelming experiences.  I had the combo of the classic ramen with thick noodles, and a side dish of rice and shredded pork on top.  The ramen was ok - nothing amazing.  The egg on my ramen was over cooked, and the broth seemed like it had a lot of MSG.  I can usually finish my noodle broths but I can't with Kinton's broth.  The side dish was straight up disappointing - literally shredded pork on white rice.  No sauce, very bland and boring.  Good thing I didn't have to wait to eat here - otherwise I'd be quite annoyed!  Staff is very friendly, and I do like the atmosphere and decor of the restaurant. Average prices compared to other ramen spots.  Wouldn't crave to come back here though."}
{"text":"Got the original tonkotsu.  Almost could not finish.  Broth is thick but flavor doesn't keep me going enough to finish the noodle.    We also got their pork rice.  It's shreded pork marinated in sweet sauce and refrigerated.  Good, but not great.  Go to Yokato Yokabai if you want good tonkotsu."}
{"text":"Top Ramen in Toronto.  I have been to a lot of Ramen places and I always compare it back to my experience at Kinton.   Reasons why I LOVE Kinton Ramen 1 (Loyal fan of this location - will not go to another) 1. The Staff - Even with the turnover, new, old staff are always so pleasant. They all speak Japanese too! Even the white guy! It definitely adds to the authenticity of it.  2. Soup Base - I've gotten Light and Regular for the Shoyu and the Miso and I am always a bowler! I eat it right down to the last drop 3. Being a Kinton Bowler - come one? Who doesn't love to get a picture taken with cute japanese girls and have it posted on social media? Everyone loves to feel special and they are great at that. 4. The ambience - its so lively when you're greeted and they yell something in Japanese. It's welcoming as if you're going into their home. Even when you go to the washroom they have toiletries that regular restaurants wouldnt offer (listerine!)  5. The Noodles - made there and cooked to PERFECTION. Not Soggy, not undercooked and you're given just the right amount in your bowl 6. The Pork - they have expanded their protein options, but my favourite is still the pork shoulder. I love that they torch it. It adds extra flavour and is entertaining to watch when you're sitting at the bar facing the kitchen. 7. The Alcoholic Drinks - They have Sapporo on tap and several other mixed drinks, My two favourite are the tomato juice and sapporo and the lemonade and sapporo. Very refreshing and not overly priced.   Don't get me wrong, there are negative aspects too that other people have pointed out. Parking for instance? And the fact that it's Salty. But what do you expect? You're eating out! Be ready for the sodium intake - why do you think it tastes so damn good?!   This is definitely a leader in all the ramen places in toronto."}
{"text":"Okay so this was my first time cheating on KINTON#1. I've been going there since the beginning of time.   We decided to go to KINTON 2 because it was closer by. Let's say I wasn't completely disappointed but I was also not as satisfied as when I leave K1.  A few things that made me dislike: The broth was not as good The menu was different  There was not the same atmosphere   A few things that were just as good if not better: The staff were gracious and polite The actual space is more roomy and open  The noodles were still nice and chewy   Overall, I'd probably return again but would still prefer KINTON 1!"}
{"text":"Out of all the ramen places I have tried downtown Toronto, I'd say this place has the best portions. Ramen bowls are relatively small but this place gives you twice the amount compared to other ramen places. My personal favourites are the Shio Ramen and Spicy Garlic Ramen! I also like ordering Gyozas as appetizers and a pint of Sapporo as my drink.  You can also become a Kinton Bowler! Basically, they keep a tally of how many bowls you completely finish. Depending on how many bowls you completely eat, you can win prizes! The only downside about this place is the wait because it's such a small restaurant."}
{"text":"One of my friends who is a big foodie had recommended Kinton Ramen a number of times, so finally I had the opportunity to join her.  We went to the Bloor Street location and I had the Chicken Shoyu with Regular Broth and thin noodles. Typically I go for the spicy version because I don't find the regular to have enough kick, but it was delicious. I've had a fair amount of Ramen, and typically I don't finish the broth - I drank pretty much every last drop of it.  I will definitely be going back and would recommend it to friends."}
{"text":"Hi!! I'm a vegetarian that eats animal broth, apparently a difficult concept to understand for the team at Kinton. I wanted some spicy ramen with tofu-not a hard problem right? The waitress, manager on duty, then chef were completely unaccommodating. Although it would have been able to get any other protein for the same price, $10.90, they wouldn't allow any \"substitutions\" to the ramen (no tofu) but suggested I could give my meat to one of my friends and wanted to sell me on the tofu appetizer that I could add to my ramen instead (which was also almost $6 extra!). Ended up with an boring flavored vegetarian ramen that I jazzed up with the addition of the kimchee appetizer.   Also repeatedly had to ask for things before getting them-soy sauce, Diet Coke that was ordered, etc. And not a fan of the yelling whenever someone enters/exits the restaurant.   Will not be returning."}
{"text":"Ramen was really good. But it's very tiny inside. Very tiny.  We were seated at a stool near the kitchen. We ordered a lemonade with our ramen. The lemonade was the size of a shot glass. Don't order their drinks and waste your money. You would get ripped off"}
{"text":"I came here on a late Tuesday evening and they were very accommodating even though we stayed beyond closing hours.    I ordered the jalapeno broth with a seasoned egg on the side.  I thought it was interesting that they gave a chicken broth option instead of only having pork broth like most places.  The jalapeno only came in chicken broth but I didn't really taste the jalapeno flavour at all.  My ramen was served with four pieces of sliced fresh jalapeno and I wondered was this worth the $1.50 up charge.  I regret ordering the \"rich\" option for my soup because it made me feel gross less than half way through eating.  I also noticed that everyone else had a seasoned egg and not sure if they forgot to give me an extra egg or what not.    The exterior and interior design is really cool!"}
{"text":"J'apprécie. Yelp exige que je mette du texte, alors voilà, une place sympathique, les ramens sont à niveau, il y a du choix. Ah oui, c'est pas mal plus propre qu'ailleurs!"}
{"text":"Whenever I have a ramen craving, Kinton Ramen is my solution.   I've been here more than five times this year (back when I was too lazy to write reviews), and every time I've left this place comfortably stuffed and ready to come back again. There's honestly nothing I can complain about: the service is fast and super welcoming, the prices are good, and the broth is among the best I've ever tasted. I almost always get the shoyo pork, and I almost always try - and fail - not to drink all the broth. To put it simply, this is one of the restaurants where I can't help but tip generously every time."}
{"text":"Came here on a cold Saturday night for takeout. I was disappointed. By the time I got home to eat it, the noodles were very hard. I even try to boil it and soak it in the hot soup longer. The soup was too thick and I had ask for thinner soup.  Overall quite disappointed with my Kinton Ramen takeout.  Dining in is better!"}
{"text":"I had the pork original with thin noodles and a pint of Sapporo. The egg is probably my favourite part of the meal so the original comes with the egg by default the other flavours it would be considered an add on. I tried my friend's miso soup order and much preferred my own original flavour one. Weekends are quite busy but the wait times aren't bad. Service is friendly and prompt.   Still one of my favourite ramen spots for their flavour and noodle!"}
{"text":"I try to track down the best ramen joint in each city that I visit. I'm feeling good about my visit to Kinton Ramen - I stopped in here mid-afternoon after hiking up to the Mont Royal chalet. I tried the spicy pork with egg. The broth was out-of-this-world flavorful and I would definitely come back. Recommend!"}
{"text":"Solid ramen--chewy noodles (how ramen should be!), hot meaty broth, decent (although almost too fatty) meat, and perfectly done egg.  Atmosphere is fun, too.   Down side? The wait!"}
{"text":"Amazing ramen place ! Got taken here as I never had ramen and this place was amazing. Plenty of options for your soup base and tons of additional toppings to choose from. I got the miso chicken with thin noodles and I regret both! Truly could eat here every day !"}
{"text":"Love the spicy garlic pork ramen,but having the staff constantly scream is a bit obnoxious - this became annoying and unappetizing after a while."}
{"text":"I had the pink lemonade, chicken shoyu ramen and matcha cheesecake.   Drink: The pink lemonade was really good, a nice balance of lemonade and grenadine and it was a good contrast to the soup.   Ramen: The thick noodles were really good, and not over cooked. The bowls look small but they put a lot of noodles in. The chicken was not cooked well enough for my taste. It was very soft and had the taste of those frozen chicken pieces you can buy in the grocery store (bland). I also found the soup broth to be pretty bland, it has a slight taste of chicken noodle soup with soy sauce and would benefit from fish flavour (maybe dried anchovies?) or mushrooms. The WEIRDEST part of the ramen was the white onion. There were lots of tiny pieces and I didn't really enjoy it.   Dessert: The cheesecake was tiny but dense. It was pretty good, and came with a (frozen...why??) berry and a little whipped cream. The cheesecake flavour was good but the matcha flavour was lacking. It just tasted like regular New York style cheesecake.   Overall, I don't think I would personally go back. But if I do, I will order something completely different. The seating is almost entirely single seats. You may also be directly facing the cooks in the kitchen so this may be uncomfortable for some people. The servers were great and really sweet so that was nice. The washroom was clean, with free mouthwash. There's a small area to hang up jackets. It might be a good place for people who just want a quick cheap lunch, but not much more in my opinion."}
{"text":"Came here on a whim after finding out that they finally have a new ramen joint in Mississauga! I called in advance to double check if there was a massive line-- and there was no wait at all! This was at 6pm on a Saturday. I was worried about not being able to find parking but they had ample street parking right in front of the restaurant at $1 an hour.   Immediately upon walking in you get the izakaya vibe where they shout to greet you. Our server was Charlie and he was super nice and helpful!! I ordered the pork miso and my fiancé ordered the pork shoyu with added grated garlic. Also ordered the karaage as a starter. Food came out sooo quickly! The karaage was SOOOO good and unlike any karaage that I've had recently. The pork miso was also amazing with the creamy broth and nicely flavoured non-fatty pork!  Charlie noticed that my fiancé had cleaned his ramen bowl out and they took a picture with him to post on Instagram LOL!   Overall I'm happy that kinton has finally opened in Mississauga and I would never have to go to kenzo ever again!!!  Btw they have stamp cards too!! You need to finish your ramen to the last drop to get a stamp!"}
{"text":"Nothing is more comforting than a hot bowl of soup noodles.   At Kinton I get my ramen fix. Theres a variety of options and toppings. The broth is always flavorful and I can tell it's made with time, many ingredients and lots of experience. Some of the ramen spots opening up lately taste a bit....instant? But Kinton always has so much flavour.  The portions are good and prices are average."}
{"text":"Came here with 3 other people on a Wednesday night and waited about 15 min. We were seated by the bar and were able to watch them prepare the ramen.  We ordered the spicy karaage chicken which was definitely spicy! Although it was nice and crunchy, it seemed a little over sauced but maybe that's just the way it's made.  I ordered the original pork ramen which came with 2 sheets nori, 2 pieces of pork, and an entire soft boiled egg. The broth wasn't too salty and very delicious! The pork was perfectly tender, I just wish there were more slices. My only issue was the noodles--they seemed slightly too al dente for ramen, perhaps they should have been boiled slightly longer. All in all, definitely enjoyed this ramen and would recommend if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"Miso Pork Ramen with thick noodles  Soup base tastes very good. It is the soul of the ramen. Noodles are chewy. I really like the texture. By the way, you have a choice of thick and think noodles. I chose thick noodles.  Overall, the bowl of ramen is delicious. Just that I feel that it's a bit pricey. The bowl looks small to me and it costs $11.99."}
{"text":"This is a very cozy Japanese ramen place with a good selection of ramen.  The service is friendly and efficient and good.  The prices very reasonable and the ramen delicious.  Wish it is open on Sundays.  Beware of the long line-ups and place your name on the list.  The wait is usually a great way to build up a good appetite.  My favorite is miso ramen and ask for fresh chilis on the side."}
{"text":"40 minute wait mid afternoon for a highly over fatty broth and missing egg from the tonkatsu ramen in mid afternoon. Not the first time I've been there but the last for long while."}
{"text":"This is a super belated review, as I came here last year at around Christmas time. I didn't have Yelp at that time, and only stumbled upon my photos now!  Came here after visiting the Christmas market, and was very excited to slurp down some hot noodles and soup. We started off with some green tea, which was nicely packaged in mason jars (so hipster) - careful though, as they cost extra!  We then ordered an appetizer of tako wasabi to share. This was my first time trying, and I loved it! It was delicious. We also got a side of takoyaki, which was decent. It definitely was quite soggy and the flavour fell flat. Nothing like what you'd get in Osaka, but I obviously can't compare Canadian standards to authentic Japanese cuisine!  I ordered the original pork ramen, as I've heard it's what Kinton is famous for. Unfortunately, I was quite disappointed by the end result! The chashu, unlike what it should be, was literally pure fat. Although that may appeal to some people, I didn't find it to be the best companion to the meal. The broth was bone white, but for some reason, I found that it really did lack depth of flavour. It was fatty, for sure, but I've made ramen broth at home, and I really do think it was missing that collagen. I've had better broth at smaller ramen joints, and perhaps Kinton is just too large a franchise/business to really put as much effort into its broth anymore.  Overall, it was okay, but would likely not return just for its ramen."}
{"text":"Lunch special is a great deal. I had the spicy garlic broth with thick noodles and pork shoulder. The meal comes with a free side of one of four choices. I went for the perfectly cooked chicken gyoza(4). The salad option comes with free dessert. This place has a great vibe I'd you're into high fast loud energy from the friendly staff. Kinton was made by the same guys of Guu. So if you've been to Guu, you know what to expect. I can really recommend you stop by Kinton for lunch if you find yourself in Korea Town."}
{"text":"The concept of ramen is not new to me. Rather, I have been having this broth+noodle+anything-else combo since I was small. My mom's soup was so good that anything else really didn't compare. So now that it seems Toronto has been riding the ramen craze for some time now, this was my first Ramen restaurant experience ever.  My friends and I decided to check this location and as soon as you enter, you are bombarded with a flurry of loud shouts and loud greetings - it's very lively. We were really lucky that the 4 of us got a table (facing across from each other) as opposed to sitting in front of the cooks/chefs (which is fun in a way). It seems like everything is shouted here: orders, drinks, etc...  I was really hungry so I had the Chicken Ramen with an extra order of bean sprouts. Now, I was the first one to finish my ramen and I was the only one out of my friends that finished. I really loved the noodles (it had that bouncy bite to it). The broth, although good, was really salty and the rest of my friends also commented on the high sodium content - a star deducted just for that as the soup makes the ramen!   I would pass on ordering the extra bean sprouts. At $1 extra, all I got was a handful of soggy sprouts hidden underneath my egg.   I can see the appeal of this place: the food is good, it's simple, and the atmosphere is lively. I would not recommend this place for a leisurely meal. It really is a grab and go type of place, and with it being so busy, I can appreciate the fast turnover for seats. You can basically slurp your soup+noodles in 30 minutes."}
{"text":"I came here to try the ramen after seeing all the positive reviews on Yelp, and I have to agree, it's pretty good even with my high standards - I am an absolute lover of ramen and have been chasing bowls of ramen all around the world. The standard bowl of ramen comes with two different types of broth (went with the pork broth), and two different types of meat (went with the pork which comes with a nice slice of pork shoulder and pork belly) as well as the flavor (opted for spicy garlic, because you can never have enough garlic). I sat with the gf at the counter, which allowed us to watch the chef make the ramen and my mouth started watering as the dish came together. In terms of the actual dish itself, the broth was full of flavor (a little thick, which for me is a good thing), the pieces of pork were delicious, and the ramen of the perfect consistency. My only regrets were not ordering extra meat and not getting the egg because it's not a complete bowl of ramen without the egg.   The gf got the ton ton don bowl as part of the ramen combo, which turned out to be a good, light complement to the ramen. If I had stayed longer in Toronto, I would have liked to come back and try the peanut butter ramen, which sounds amazing. Pro tip for those visiting Toronto, the Art Gallery of Toronto is right near by and is also definitely worth a visit!"}
{"text":"Come here if you want to spend $10 on a bowl of instant noodles. Chicken miso was bland as fuck.. the chicken was unseasoned and tasted like it sat in hot water for a day. Soup base tasted like hot water and salt, seriously I could have made better noodles from a packet at home.   Now let's talk about service. I don't know if the hostess working tonight is a moron or what but she kept making eye contact with us as she walled around like we wanted something from her. UH YES WE DO? We'd like to be seated? A couple came in after us and she decided to seat them first ignoring the fact that we were standing 4 feet away from her. Lady.. I get it that you're a bit busy but use that moronic brain of yours to help understand the situation.   After being seated, I'm already thinking \"totally not impressed of this place\". Same lady came to our table to take our order and asked us for drinks and we replied with water. Some how this slipped her mind.. like how? It's essential to serve water, don't even have to ask. People who were seated after us got their water, what about us? We eventually got it... after getting the ramen LMAO.  After the meal I asked for the bill and it came up to $25.98. I put down $31 and was hoping to get a $5 bill back because if she did the math in her head $31 - $26 = we didn't like the food and you so give me my $5 bill. She comes back with $5.05 in change. She must have a thick fucking head to think that she provided decent service to deserve a tip. Moral of the story is save your $10 and eat at home and if you encounter that female hostess/waitress (she's no fob) at this location, don't tip cause she's a useless tool."}
{"text":"We had both the chicken and (spicey) pork options. And they're delicious (though I like my broth thicker for the pork). Service was prompt and helpful. Ambience was warm, yet chic.   Repeat: Yes (but unlikely on a weekday, when it'll likely get crazy)."}
{"text":"Just like all they're other locations ... fantastic!! Love the broth!!  Simple, delightful, flavourful, fresh, hot and affordable.  If you haven't been here before, you simply choose your way down the steps (photo of menu attached). Choose your broth, flavour, soup, noodle, meat and additional toppings.  Clean and new restaurant, friendly service.  Sitting at the high top you get to see them put your dish together. They torch the pork belly too.   They have special menu combos or special ones for different days and for two dollars you get a side dish for example.   If you are hungry, for an additional $2 you can add extra noodles.  If you want more meat, it is an additional $2.50.  If you love garlic as much as me, I suggest you add grated garlic in the additional topic section for $1. a melon ball size of delicious garlic. Just beware of garlicky breath after. Dont worry though, they offer free mouth wash in the bathroom.  They have Sapporo on tap ranging from a mini size (8oz smaller than a regular glass of coke, image uploaded)., a pint (16oz), big mug (32oz) and a pitcher (60oz). They also have sake, beer bottles and beer cocktails.  If you can't get into this location they have a few other locations, check their website!"}
{"text":"Came here for a late lunch and the place was quiet which is a nice change from the usual lining up to eat ramen. I had the pork spicy garlic ramen with thick noodles. We also had a side order of gyoza and karaage. Overall the gyoza was not bad by Toronto standards. The karaage was exceptional and was boneless. The batter was very crispy but not oily. The ramen was the star of the show, and was really good. Too spicy for my liking but was really good. The broth was full of flavour and the thick wavy noodles picked up a lot of the broth to slurp with. Overall a real winner. I will be back one day to try more."}
{"text":"Happy to report that this location is just as good as the Queens location in Toronto. Tried the daily special - a burnt miso ramen with pork, seasoned egg, chop suey, corn, etc. Delicious!   We got a seat at the counter where you can see the magic happen in the kitchen. A good hearty lunch packed with flavour. Next time I get to go there on a Monday, I'll try the karaage ramen because that looked awesome too!"}
{"text":"A broken heart is not unlike a broken bone in that you have no choice but to just bear the weight and discomfort of it until it eventually heals. It is in these times we turn to comfort food and for me it's ramen. To come in from the cold and mix my own tears with the ones induced by a delicious bowl of spicy ramen noodle soup is just what the heart doctor ordered, to which I happened upon the new Kinton Ramen location on Bloor in Korea Town.   The first thing you'll notice about the restaurant is it's clean and crisp modern appearance followed quickly by the wave of high energy the place exudes. As a customer you are greeted by all staff in a boisterous greeting in Japanese the minute they lay eyes on you. The servers on high alert hang up your jacket and seat you as quickly as possible. From there you are given a menu to browse as the onslaught of what I assume is Tokyo Pop dance music attempts to drown out the walla-walla of your fellow customers.   I ordered the miso based ramen with pork belly. From there I was given a glass of water in a cool metal cup, chopsticks and a wooden spoon which I appreciate over the plastic or porcelain that you usually get in Asian restaurants. The soup came hot and smelling delicious. I quickly dove in and found the ramen warming me, stimulating the pleasure centers of my brain long neglected.   The staff always attentive checked in on me periodically to see if I was enjoying everything, which I was. By end meal I was informed that if I finished every last drop in the bowl they would give me a discount card towards free dumplings and plaster my face on their facebook wall. Well who was I to say no to brilliant market ideas. I was instructed to show off my empty bowl as they snapped a picture of me via an iPad. I looked at the picture, the ramen having eeked out a smile from me over the affects of a still broken heart.   All in all a great high energy place with delicious ramen with friendly and attentive staff. A little too cacophonous for quiet intimate dining however. Kinton exudes lots of friendly energy with their food and that's just what I needed."}
{"text":"Came here for Sunday afternoon with 3 other friends. We came in around 1:45pm for lunch and waited around 15 minutes for a table. They have very limited seating at this location, and it's very hard for them to accommodate groups larger than 3. The waitress's advised us multiple times that it would be 5 minutes wait, but in total we had waited 15 minutes, however the servers apologized for the waiting time and they were all super friendly.  We got seated at the bar, hoping to get a table face to face tho since I wanted to catch up with my friends. The bar definitely limited the conversations and it was difficult to hear my friend talking on the other side.  However the bar area had front seats to the kitchen where they were making the ramen!  I opted for the port original ramen with thick noodles, pork belly. I enjoyed the noodles, quite chewy which I liked. The broth was mediocre. And the porn belly was too chewy for me which was difficult for me to break apart since it came in 1 big piece. The egg in the ramen was amazing tho! Wish I knew how to make it like that at home (yolk melts out)  I would come again if it was a smaller group(1-2 people)   Washrooms were quite far downstairs. As well since it's a smaller resto, they do encourage people to put up their jackets in the rack in the front. All their chairs do not have any backings so it's not meant for you to sit for a long time"}
{"text":"The restaurant is loud, small and a good portion of the tables are communal. The ramen is delicious. It's a nice big portion, the broth is full of flavour and absolutely delicious (order the spicy garlic broth) and the noodles are the perfect texture.  Unfortunately, it's also ridiculously salty, to the point where I was uncomfortable after the meal from all the sodium coursing through my veins. So salty that I probably won't go back.  If you're willing to put up with the feeling you get after you've eaten FAR too much salt for a great meal, then absolutely check this place out. It's not for me though."}
{"text":"So what used to be the only, but superb Ramen has now fallen a bit.  Going back to revisit the broth wasn't quite as good as it used to be and the pork lower quality.   They give you less now for the extra pork option and with so many Ramen places I would recommend almost anywhere would be superior.   The Karage is pretty good and if you like thick chewy noodles no other places do it quite like this, but to me, it's all about the broth."}
{"text":"finally got to try this place.They serve a decent bowl but not as refined as what you would get at santouka. I liked that the noodles had a little bite to it but the broth and pork could have been better.  I got the spicy garlic ramen and although they do put a big lump of grated garlic on top of it, as a garlic lover, i still found it lacking. I was neither disappointed nor impressed with Kinton. A lot less yelling would have been better."}
{"text":"We were looking for a place to eat at around 1pm on a weekend, walked by Kinton and noticed that there were a considerable number of seats empty. I didn't even know  that there was a Kinton in this area, but a ramenya with a lot of empty seats?! I must enter.  I've already had Kinton at baldwin and was not every impressed. I ordered the pork miso this time and still have the exact same review. I ordered just regular, with pork shoulder, and I found the broth to be a bit too fatty. The broth does not have a great flavor to it so this is probably the last time I'm eating here. My wife on the other hand, got the pork, rich with pork belly and man what can I say.. liquid heart attack in a bowl. It was just ridiculously fatty that you would be nuts to eat more than have of it. If it tasted great then sure... but really It was just wrong.  What saved the dining experience was the chicken karaage. It was very very good. Nice bit size pieces. crispy skin, and the even the meat was well seasoned. If someone told me that this was the best fried chicken in Toronto, I would not have argued (stockyards has disappointed me for the last time)."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this location for a few years already - recommended by my sister and I can definitely say I fell in love. My favourite ramen is their spicy garlic! It has such good flavours, the pork shoulder is always cooked right and I really like their apps. I've been to other ramen places and always ordered a spicy ramen of some sort but they're never as good."}
{"text":"Definitely my go-to ramen place in Montreal (especially since I live down the block!) Staff is always friendly. I'm mostly vegetarian, but I indulge in meat once a month and Kinton is my place to go ! My favourite to get is the Chicken Kaarage! So good !"}
{"text":"I'm so happy Kinton Ramen opens in this neighborhood! Honestly I have been to the DT location few times, and it was not convenient for me at all especially in winter. I would rate this place as 3.5 stars. The soup is a bit oily for regular, but kinda of lose the richness if you order Light. Compared to other ramen restaurants, you kinda of have to order all your extras at extra cost. For example, the corn will cost you extra and for shoyo and miso ramen, they don't come with the eggs. But overall it is a decent ramen place, I would prefer this over Kenzo. But there are better ramen places in DT!"}
{"text":"Decor: 4/5 Modern House music in the background - funky, jazzy, chill house, not mainstream house Bar seating for ~20 Two tables seat 6-8 each at front and back of room Very clean nice washrooms with relaxing music, mouthwash provided  Service: 4/5 Friendly   Food: 3.5/5  1. Choose your flavor of broth 2. Choose the amount of fat - light or medium or heavy 3. Choose your meat - chicken or pork belly or pork shoulder  Noodles are the slightly thicker wavy style, chewy, made well.  Spicy garlic ramen - broth is just lightly spicy, heavy miso flavor, could have been warmer.   Shio Ramen:  Good salt flavor  Egg - overcooked, yolk was translucent but solid Pork Belly - seared with torch before serving - well flavored, not overly salty Pork Shoulder - mixed feelings - torched before serving - it was lean but some parts were just too hard and chewy like jerky. Other parts were belly-like - soft and fatty"}
{"text":"Went on a Sunday afternoon for lunch and waited 35 mins for a table of 4. I'm not sure when they started to have lunch specials but it's a pretty decent deal. About $12 for a bowl of ramen, rice dish and drink. I thoroughly enjoyed my spicy ramen and rice but was overly stuffed. Maybe they should have this as dinner special instead... My favourite part about my visits are being able to watch the chefs in action! They have a lot of energy and its what makes the ramen that much tastier.  I would definitely recommend this place but they should expand their location or something because the wait times are sometimes unbearable."}
{"text":"***Update from the next morning after we came here: Both my boyfriend and I have been up all night having \"the runs\" to the washroom. We're pretty sure it's from eating here because we did not eat anything else out of the ordinary yesterday. This is making me take another star off to make it 2 stars. Will not be back for sure now.  ------  I came here on a Saturday evening around 7:30 with my boyfriend. It was pretty busy, but we were seated immediately since we were only a group of 2. Those who were waiting had groups of around 4-8 and had to wait until a table cleared up that was able to accommodate that large of a group. It was pretty overwhelming and chaotic though, trying to speak to the host who was taking down names/number of people in each table since he kept walking back and fourth, and those of us that were waiting to be taken a number we're basically fighting over who speaks to him first. All of that aside, again, we were seated pretty quickly since we were a group of 2.  The menu is pretty small. I wish there were more options of the ramen. We ordered gyozas to start off. I ordered the pork original ramen with thin noodles and seaweed, and my boyfriend ordered the pork miso ramen with thick noodles. We also had the matcha cheesecake for desert. The gyoza was really yummy. We both enjoyed it. As for the ramen, it was pretty mediocre. We were pretty disappointed that there weren't much condiments in the ramen, as you had to order that from the \"additional toppings\" side of the ramen menu. I found it pretty pricey because other ramen places already include that stuff and dont have to pay extra unless if you want extra. So basically, my ramen only had noodles, seaweed, more seaweed, egg (which I did not care for), and 1 piece of pork. My boyfriend had noodles, corn, and 1 piece of pork. I enjoyed the thin noodles, but my boyfriend wasn't too happy with his thick noodles. He was asking if my noodles were cooked properly and when I asked him why, he said because the texture of his noodles \"were weird\". So I tried them and I instantly knew what he was talking about. You could tell the difference between the thin and thick noodles because of the texture of the noodles. His thick noodles seemed to be a little underdone as if they weren't fully cooked yet, whereas mine were perfectly cooked. There were no complaints about the matcha cheesecake, other than the size, but we didn't really mind it since we were pretty fully.  Just a heads up, refills are not free here...even if you ordered tea (and just need hot water to refill). So we just sticked to the water.   On a good note, once you are seated, the staff here are very helpful. There are multiple of them going around the tables so all you have to do is flag one down and they'll be there to answer your question or grab whatever it is you need.  Probably won't be back unless if we're desperate for ramen and this is the only option left or unless we're invited by friends to come here."}
{"text":"First time being back to this location in years and I have to say that it has lost a lot quality over the years.   The once tasty broth that was complex and full of taste has turned into an average bland flavour.  Even the spoons and spoon hold show a lot of wear and tear that desperately need replacing."}
{"text":"I just discovered their new location on Bloor that just opened before Christmas.  The decor is similar to the Baldwin location, but the spacing seems better due to the different floor plan.  My group of 4 didn't have to wait at all on Saturday night at 8pm.  This could be because not a lot of people know about this new location yet, or that there is just so many food alternatives in the Annex area to bother waiting.   The pricing of the menu seems to be a bit cheaper than the Baldwin store, this location one even gives you the choice of thin or thick noodles that many of the rival Ramen places now offer too.  FYI - the thick is the regularly served Kinton noodles at Baldwin.  The Ramen is also similar to the original location, which is great!  The broth is thick and tasty yet not overly salty.  A side of pork Gyozo comes in 4 and is plump and crisp to perfection.    Overall, a great addition to the Kinton family that serves similar quality Ramen without the long ass line up!"}
{"text":"I LOVE KINTON RAMEN!   I am sooo happy they now have a location in Markham (otherwise I have only been to the Toronto locations).  It is JUST as good as the ones downtown and I crave their ramen all the time.  Friendly staff, very fast service, and great location and design!  I will be back most Saturdays (as I work close by on Saturdays)  *** EDIT: I just read all the reviews that seem to be completely opposite to mine. I have been there 4 times already and have had no problems. My suggestion would be to go alone, sit at the bar, and go at 5pm on a Saturday. That's what I usually do and everything is perfect."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch on Saturday.  Wasn't busy got seated right away.  The staff was very on top of things and we ordered our usual and got it quickly.  Ramen (thick) was nice and chewy.  Didn't notice any difference from other locations.  In and out quickly."}
{"text":"The menu is pretty simple..you pick either pork or chicken ramen broth..then u pick the type of soup base (original-sea salt, miso, spicy, shoyu), then thick or think noodle, then meat. You can request to add more topping like corn, green onion, etc for additional charge.  Overall, the ramen is pretty good..I would say it is an authentic Japanese ramen place. The soup base(original) is really flavorful.I would say it is on the oily side..the pork meat is tender..However, I could not finish the entire ramen, because half through eating this ramen, the oil grease and the flavor were too much.."}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed! We are Kinton Bowlers and wanted to order takeout, BUT, apparently you can't call in to place an order. We wanted to order takeout, but were given the run around. We were told that we could only pay by gift card and then were told that the kitchen wouldn't take our order. Don't offer something you can't do!"}
{"text":"This restaurant was really busy when I visit there, so I understood even though staff forgot us. However they didnt bring water and didnt explain their menu and I had to call the staff to order ramen. I was very uncomfortable and the chilled ramen was awful. I never visit there again."}
{"text":"I usually get: - Shoyu ramen, light broth and pork belly or - Spicy garlic ramen, regular broth and pork belly (Doesn't come with a marinated egg so you'll either have to live with it or pay bit extra for it)  I tried shoyu with rich broth and found that it was too salty, went for regular and it was still a bit too much. Light broth is the best option for me.  Kinton really knows how to market their restaurant with the Kinton bowler pins and their recent 10,000 Kinton Bowler celebration (scored myself a coupon for some free gyoza for finishing a bowl).   Great staff, great music and really great food! Their spicy karaage is delicious as well!"}
{"text":"TOP TIP: If you're on a date, stay away from the SPICY GARLIC RAMEN.   BUT if you're looking to keep a 500m radius between you and all vampires for the rest of the night, get the SPICY GARLIC RAMEN.   100%, you will be sweating garlic juice after this meal. delicious, but it's best to have your dining companion(s) order the same meal else you will have my experience of ducking your boyfriend's reeking breath* the rest of the night. sexy.  the HOT KARAAGE provides a mini garlic reprieve in the form of crispy & heavily sauced chicken nuggets. large pieces of fried meat unobstructed by bone? um, win!  --  *the smart kids behind Kinton have already thought ahead by offering mouthwash in their beautiful zen washrooms** **across from said washrooms is a mural-sized glowing pig on the wall. I want that light fixture."}
{"text":"Loved that this was open after our long flight to Montreal. Had the pork ramen with shoyu broth and an egg. Very good. Hit the spot in the 30 degree weather.  The egg was perfect and sweet!    We really wanted the oxtail ramen or chicken karaage one but they sold out. Next time!  Had the black sesame soy milk pudding for dessert.  Smooth and light.   A gem in the middle of the business district!"}
{"text":"Food 4/5 (60% of final grade) I ordered an item special to this location called the \"Ikebukuro Gangsta Spicy Ramen\". I really love my spice, but most places don't have spicy enough food. Be assured that this was spicy enough, alright. Right in the middle of eating it I felt my stomach growl in defiance, but my palate told me not to stop so 'lo and behold, 6 cups of water later I was super happy. The ramen came with the soft-boiled egg and two slices of pork, but I ordered another egg and another slice of pork, because it was so yummy. The noodles themselves were mediocre, but the broth, pork, and eggs were DELISH. Especially the eggs. I LOVE SOFT BOILED SHOYU EGGS.   Ambiance 3/5 (10% of final grade) I went during an event where three bowls of ramen were combined into one, and if people finished it within 15 minutes it would be free, if not then it'll be $30. I didn't do the challenge, but went for the festivities. What bugged me wasn't the hustle and bustle of the restaurant in general (as it was very busy), but that the music was so blaring that I couldn't even converse with my friends sitting right in front of me. The Japanese-yelling of the employees made for a nice-pseudo-authentic-japanese touch to the place though, so that was cool.  Service 3/5 (10% of final grade) The line was long, but that's ok, since there was a special event. What bugged me was that they wouldn't seat my group of friends when I was running late-- apparently they can't seat a group of 4 if one was missing, which might have its management advantages, but it wasn't communicated well. Since it was busy, we had to flag them down for orders to be taken, and for water to be refilled. The only reason it scored a 3 and not lower is because they were very pleasant in the short instances that we actually interacted.   Cost 2.5/5 (10% of final grade) The food was great, but it wasn't a steal or anything. The price could be lower for this place to really be a jewel.   Brownie Points 3/5 (10% of final grade) Nice washrooms with lots of amenities! I think Kinton has, by far, the best washrooms out of all the places I've been.  Final Grade = 71/100 = 4 Stars  TLDR: A nice place to have dinner alone, but not the best if you want to have nice dinner conversations. Yummy ramen and nice ambiance!"}
{"text":"Food 3/5 (60% of final grade) Though I agree that the ramen itself (the noodles) was very fresh, the soup base was incredibly oily and heavy. Otherwise, nothing special. The presentation was quite nice though.  Ambiance 2.5/5 (10% of final grade) Usually I like places that are culturally fueled. I think Kinton attempts to portray the traditional ramen shop feeling, but because of the little tweaks they did to market to the Canadian demographic, it didn't feel fully authentic, per-say. This location was also particularly cramped. However, do keep in mind that it was lunch hour and in the dead of summer when I went, so my perception might be skewed.   Service 3/5 (10% of final grade) The waitress took our order and left, simple, no-frills service. But it was very cool to have the chefs (open kitchen) occasionally chant something in Japanese while they passionately toss the noodles-- it contributed to the homeliness of the entire vicinity.   Cost 2.5/5 (10% of final grade) Nothing to comment about the price-- it was appropriate.  Brownie Points 2.5/5 (10% of final grade) For the nice try of the chefs.  Final Grade = 57/100 = 3 Stars  TLDR:  Average price for heavy-tasting-but-nicely-presented ramen. Not something I'd soon crave."}
{"text":"J'ai pris une entrée de tako (pieuvre) wasabi et personne ne l'a appréciée. Il y avait une texture bizarre gélatineuse dans la sauce où la pieuvre baignait c'était trop salé et ça goûtait trop le wasabi. La limonade maison était bien.   On doit choisir entre les options suivantes : 1- poulet ou porc  2- bouillon original, shoyu, miso ou épicée  3- nouilles épaisses ou minces  4- extra garnitures (uf, jalapeno, etc.)  J'ai pris porc, bouillon épicée avec nouilles épaisses. Le bouillon épicé était avec de l'ail gratté en une boule, échalotes, fèves germées et 2 tranches de porc. Je trouvais qu'il manquait de viande, soit porc haché ou uf que l'on retrouve souvent. Le bouillon n'était pas trop piquant pour moi, mais mes amis le trouvaient piquant. Je mange quand même très piquant. Pas trop salé, pas trop gras, mais il manquait un peu de goût.   J'ai goûté au bouillon de poulet original et je l'ai trouvé trop salé et ca goûtait un peu trop la soupe lipton, mais j'ai aimé la texture un peu plus épaisse/grasse du bouillon.   C'était un bon plat. Mais moins bon que le misoya ou le yokato yokabai ou meme le imadake. Les nouilles étaient bonnes par contre, meilleur que le big in japan (pas aimé big in japan pour les ramens). Étant donné que j'ai trouvé moins bon que ces restaurants, j'ai hésité à donner 3 étoiles.   L'ambiance était bonne. Ils ont une terrasse, mais elle n'est pas chaleureuse. On dirait une terrasse de la cafétéria de mon bureau avec des tables et chaises style métallique.  Le service était sympathique.   Je suis content de l'avoir essayé et je vous invite à l'essayer, mais je vous suggère le yokato yokabai. Il y avait d'autres entrées comme le karaage (poulet frit) épicé qui avait l'air bien. J'y retournerai pour essayer et donner une 2e chance."}
{"text":"i was really excited to try this place, but it really wasnt kid friendly. the music was popping and the bar stools were too high for a small child. so unfortunately we did not eat here.   i gave it 3 stars for good decor and the awesome up eat vibe with loud music. it would be a great date place.  we ended up eating at crazy don which was crap. if this place is full, dont go to crazy don, go to the shawarma place"}
{"text":"I came here during the off-peak hours because I always see a massive line during lunch and dinner hours. No wonder they have massive lineups because they have a maximum seating capacity of 37. If you have a big group, this Kinton might not be ideal since they only have the big table up front which can sit 10 people. The rest of the tables are for 2-3 people and there is space on the bar. Overall, this location is ideal for a group of 2 to 3 people.  I ordered the Pork Ramen, Miso soup broth, thick noodles, and pork belly and added a seasoned egg.  I found that the broth was a bit saltier than the other branches. The noodles were soaking in with the broth, which made the thick noodles more flavorful. The egg was on par with the other locations as it was runny and tasted great.  Its worth to add an egg to your bowl of ramen!  The atmosphere is nice and the music is pretty loud. If there is a long lineup, they rush you to leave by giving me the bill when I haven't even finished my ramen yet."}
{"text":"Came back and got a more popular option.   Get the rich miso pork belly with thin noodles. I believe this is all people get along with the spicy garlic noodles as everything else is probably average on best.   Really reminded me of the ichiran chain back in Asia. Will be back!"}
{"text":"The original branch, both the service and food gone downhill as they continue to expand. They cut a lot of corners in terms of meat and toppings. This particular location will do the job in terms of service and food if you're looking to just fill in hunger.   They do quite a lot of promotions (free gyoza, cheap beer), make sure to watch for those. Note that not all the ramen does not come with the half boiled egg. Broth can also be extremely salty to some."}
{"text":"It's opened finally! I'm expecting to try it out and compare with other locations. Me & my friend had lunch today, got there around 12:30 we were lucky to be seated right away (saw some people waiting ahead of us, maybe they a group of 3 or more). It took a while to have the order done as they are lack of manpower to serve customers; then it took about an hour to wait for our food, the first 15 mins for the original karaage (Japanese style fried chicken) spent another 45 mins for the ramen noodle. They were super busy during the lunch hour, many people lined up at the door, also some take out orders. The texture of noodle and the pork slice was great, however shoyu broth taste slightly different from the one in Blood St. W. (Korean town) this one was too salty    My friend ordered jalapeno spicy chicken ramen, it was as hot as she expected , a little disappointed, but the chicken was good because of the tenderness and moist.   Overall was fine, I will go again months later (when they're not new anymore)"}
{"text":"I can't remember the last time I was at a Kinton but a new one opened up recently in the Yonge/Eglinton area. I was hot, sweaty & hungry so I decided to stop in.   I didn't order their regular ramen because I wasn't impressed with them in the past. Instead I ordered the chilled ramen which is like the poor man's version of tsukemen served cold. Just like the name says the noodles were chilled, even the 2 thick pieces of dry pork shoulder. The dipping sauce was a soya sesame base which you mix in the scallions, purée daikon, raw quail egg & wasabi into. It was different, good on a hot day if you want something cold I guess but it wasn't for me.  It seemed like I was scarfing on leftovers from someone else's fridge after waking up from a drunk fest the night before.  Service was also not up to par and I was the only patron dining.  I had to ask for more water and wasn't checked on during the meal.  Maybe that's the Japanese service culture but that will not fly in Canada."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now and each time the ramen just isn't up to snuff. First time there I ordered the pork shoyu ramen. It was so unforgettable I can't even describe it. Then 6 months later rather than eat at my fave Korean restaurant (Sunrise House) I decided to pop in for an afternoon meal. I ordered the spicy garlic pork ramen. You would think this would be amazing. What's not to like about a spicy garlicky bowl of soup and noodles. Ok I'll have to admit I'm a big fan of the Black Tonkotsu at Sansotei so that's what I was judging this on. The broth lacked any real porkyness flavour. It tasted more like salty water. Without a good rich soup base why even bother, why Kinton why??? Even the dollop of raw garlic couldn't save it.  Sorry Sansotei for cheating behind your back...you give me the BEST RAMEN when I need it so badly!"}
{"text":"Perhaps my second (or third) Ramen experience ever (aside from oodles of Mr.Noodles over the years) and I gotta say, I love this stuff. Until now, I've only had the preset Ramen orders and due to my inexperience with the cuisine that was a gift in and of itself. I have total food FOMO (fear of missing out) so no matter what I order normally, I'm always looking at other peoples orders thinking - \"Shit, I totally F'd up here, I shoulda got THAT!\"   Dining at Kinton only makes that FOMO worse, because now, I'm not only choosing my meal, but choosing every ingredient combination that goes into it. Thank god that the flavour options come with standard ingredients or I think I might cry from indecisiveness.  Here's how it works:  Step 1 (Broth): Pork or Chicken. I've only had Pork based Ramen before (loved it) so I thought Chicken might be a nice change.  Step 2 (Flavour): Depending on which broth you choose you have 4 options with different ingredients  making up each. Original, Shoyu, Miso or Spicy. I went with the Spicy Jalapeño flavour which comes dressed with Jalapeño paste, white onions, scallions and nori  Step 3 (Soup): Light, Regular or Rich. I'm a little uncertain on how this differs from the broth so I went with Regular using the Goldilocks Rationale (Not too much, not too little, juuuusstt right).  Step 4 (Noodles): Thick or Thin. The thick is recommended for pork based meals and the thin is reccomended for Chicken. I said, \"Screw that I want thick noodles\" - not messing around here.  Step 5 (Meat): This is where you can add additional meat to your order (or a different meat entirely for about $2.50). Pro-tip - just order the Extra Pork or Extra Chicken at the beginning and you get 3x the amount of a regular serving for only $4! But unless you're a vegetarian... order some extra meat on that beast!  Step 6 (Toppings): Choose from 10 additional toppings to add, beware that some of these toppings come standard in the flavour bases mentioned above, so no need to pay for them again. Toppings range from $1-$3.50 each, I went with the Seasoned Egg for $1.50! #Winning!  My good Yelp buddy Jimmy B had gone the spicy Pork route and ordered additional meat and I was mighty jealous when my meal arrived and it looked like Lipton cup of soup with boiled chicken and a few slices of Jalapeño on top..... then I took my first taste.  Wow, Dayum, Shiiit, OMG, **drooooooool**.   No matter how you say it, I judged this dish by appearances and once again was foiled. I really wish I wasn't so shallow because this isn't the first time a flavour explosion has gone off in my mouth and the back of my head gets blown off. It was amazing, in fact it was UN-Beliv-able! My only issue was that there wasn't enough. The broth was spicy and hot, the chicken amazingly seasoned and cooked, the toppings and noodles perfection.  Warning, if you order a spicy dish, beware, as the paste tends to settle at the bottom and your last few mouthfuls of broth may just leave you gasping for breath (yeah, THAT hot). So be sure to mix as you go.  Not sure what more I can say, wait times and parking are a bit of a hassle during busy times and the seats aren't the most comfortable, but once you're slurping on your ramen, nothing else matters!  Eatcrest Out!"}
{"text":"Went back and had the miso ramen with butter (a must) and it is MUCH better than the shoyu... but I also recently went to Totto Ramen in NYC, and OMG soooooooo good!!!!!!!  Due to this comparison, the rating for Kinton for me remains the same."}
{"text":"My friends and I came here for their 5 year anniversary special where their ramen was $5.18!  I was pleasantly surprised with their service and quality, which was top notch. Usually quality is not as good on a super busy day, but if from what I experienced, I would come back again.   I ordered the pork miso. We all liked the pork which was tender, but the best part that it had a grilled taste to it which added a kick. I don't think the miso added much to the broth but still tasty, not too salty. The thick noodles were cooked well and there was a lot more of it than the size of the bowl suggested. Bean sprouts and corn was good, normal. Additional toppings are at an average price of $1 each.   You can always grab dessert at the neighbouring ice cream shops along Baldwin :)"}
{"text":"If you're feeling very hungry or are craving real ramen, then this is the place to go!  As you walk in you're immediately greeted with a loud \"irashaimase\" (welcome in japanese for the unfamiliar), giving you a touch of that authentic japanese feel with a modern twist. It's great for solo diners with it's massive bar in front of the kitchen, where you can see the cooks making delicious food.  I usually order chicken ramen with a shoyu broth. I also add a lot of toppings, which while delicious is expensive.  While they offer appetizers and side dishes, you're really better off just getting ramen. I just wish you had a little more control over the bowls. It's not too much, but it is a lot of food and can get pretty expensive for ramen.  Still a great place for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Location/Service Right in the plaza of Commerce Gate, a lot of parking available and underground as well. Note the restaurant is around the corner, facing Highway 7.   The interior is consistent with all of their other locations. Bright lightning with bar tables and good size small tables as well. I'm surprised it's bigger than I thought and more spacious as well.   Service is nice, staff are friendly and very welcoming. Also check on you regularly to make sure everything is okay.   Food They amped up the menu a little bit by offering Markham location menu items and monthly specials.   Decided to try their December special, which was the Burnt Kogashi Shoyu-men. It's a soy based broth with thick noodles, pork shoulder and belly that's slightly burnt and bean sprouts.   Kinton's broth is usually a little fattier in my personal opinion, and this one was the same as well. Not it's a bad thing, but it does feel a little oily.   Cha su wise was okay, they only have 2 slices and I thought it was not enough (maybe I was way too hungry). Noodles were nice to eat with and the veggies were quite complimentary. Note there is no egg, so you can add it for $1.50.   Overall, it's an okay spot for quick ramen. The service and food is consistent and similar to their other locations."}
{"text":"I got the Shoyu ramen with pork shoulder.  Came with 2 piece of pork and a lot of noodles.  The soup base I got was super salty that is started hurting my mouth half way thru.  I barely finished the noodles because of it.  I do not recall it being so salty before so it might be a hit and miss this time.  On the top side the service was very good. staff were very polite and the noodles were cooked perfectly.  Not too soft or hard."}
{"text":"Good lunch spot for friends, I noticed their chicken-based ramen seemed quite better overall compared to their pork offerings. Prices are a tad bit more than other places, but still Kinton offers its own distinct taste compared to other ramen restaurants. It's worth a try!"}
{"text":"I've been going to the Kinton on Baldwin for a while and wanted to try their new location as its closer to my work. As always, it did not disappoint! I had the Pork Shoyu Ramen with thin noodles and the Gyoza as a side dish. Delicious! The broth was not too salty or oily and has a ton of flavour and the pork was cooked perfectly. Also, the prices are pretty decent and the staff are very nice and attentive. The only negative thing I have to say is the lack of seating and place to put your bags while eating."}
{"text":"I really like their ramen - I think my favourites are the shoyu or spicy garlic (which comes with a LOT of garlic). Kinton's ramen noodles are a good chewy texture, their broth is richly favoured, and there is a decent amount of toppings. Plus their service is always polite and friendly. Great place for ramen."}
{"text":"As a fan of ramen, this place is definitely one to try. You can customize your ramen according to your taste and they have decent appetizers. The service is also pretty quick and the staff is friendly. I love their spicy ramen, especially during the winter on a cold windy day."}
{"text":"It was okay. The service was loud and friendly, I enjoyed the atmosphere. However the vegetarian ramen was bland and boring. There was practically no flavour, the broth felt like it was just made with water. Which it probably was. The ramen was nothing special,  the kimchi (kimuchi) wasn't great it was just okay. I still enjoyed eating, had to ask for some soy sauce to at least put some flavour into it. My friend and I were disappointed and preferred Isshin way better.   Everything was great except the food was just okay. Nothing smelled bad or made me want to puke, which is good."}
{"text":"I haven't been here in a year and have been craving to come back. How disappointing, its as if they have changed management or something because the food is completely different. My wifes miso was salty to the point where it stings in your throat, there is no more pork belly on the menu (wtf?) And the pork slices you can order are tough and chewy. Not coming back. This approaches Ajisen levels of crappiness, plus my bill was 40 bucks for 2 people."}
{"text":"I've always heard such great things about kinton ramen but surprisingly I haven't been here until very recently. In my opinion, this is the best ramen i've ever had!! I got the chicken broth and the flavour was not too overpowering but it was also not bland at all. My friend got the pork broth, which is more traditional for ramen i think, but I wasnt a very big fan of it. The noodles are perfectly chewy and and the portion is a pretty good size. I was 3/4 done and was already very full. I love this place and I cant wait to eat it again!!"}
{"text":"Best place in the city for Ramen. Service is sometimes a little slow and you can expect to wait upwards of 20 mins for your order. However, it is well worth the wait. Food is fresh and delicious and the cleanliness of the restaurant is impeccable. I've been here at least 10 times and have never had a bad experience."}
{"text":"In my opinion, Ramen here is comparable to Sansotei and Santouka -- packed with flavour. I was impressed with the Karaage, which was cooked to perfection."}
{"text":"newest kinton location, definitely doesn't disappoint and is consistent with other locations. although i feel like i had an extra piece of pork shoulder with my ramen, maybe it was a fluke"}
{"text":"An okay ramen place, very strong flavours of garlic. They add huge spoons of diced garlic (I love it) so not the lunch to grab before the big meeting. Broth is a little lacking depending on which soup you get, I found their pork bone to be quite watery and meat quality is standard pho/ramen quality. Service was decent but it is hot and noisy inside, the staff are  yelling to each other despite customers sitting at the kitchen bar and it being a small space."}
{"text":"The vegetarian ramen has zero taste.   It is absolutely unimaginable that the chef/owners put such little effort into creating a menu item. The result is an absolutely flavourless vegetarian ramen. I would be deeply embarrased to even offer this item on a restaurant menu.   It's basically hot water, noodles and a few other ingredients stirred into the water.   Did the chef not taste it? Actually, he probably didn't -- cause it has no taste!  The service was excellent however.   Everyone in the restaurant could do without the constant screaming of the staff when someone enters or leaves the restaurant. It gets tired really quickly and is extremely annonying, forcing you to eat as quickly as possible and leave to avoid having to swallow a handful of headache medicine."}
{"text":"This is a solid ramen shop, with the bonus of being well located along Highway 7! Newly opened, part of the Kinton family, it looks like over the past month they've finally settled in - there's blinds to block out the setting sun (it shone in like mad...) and they've got a coat rack, a shelf built in, all the works. Their ramen boasts a simple sea salt base original, so if you're looking for tonkotsu I really don't think this is the place. Starting at $10.99, the bowl comes with some basic toppings and additional ones range from $1 to $3. The pork ramen bowls seem a tad larger, while the chicken appears smaller - I think it's just pork is heavier and makes the bowl feel tougher to consume. You'll find your classic flavours all at the same price - miso, shoyu, spicy...and there's specials that come up and change every month or two.   A variety of hot and cold tapas are available, with some unique to dinner fare only. The karaage was a little darker than I expected, but the age gyoza with their sweet chili sauce really hit the spot. The spring rolls are unique and I recommend trying them - crunchy spring roll filled with chasu pork, lotus root, glass noodles...the combination of flavour and texture served hot and crunchy is unexpectedly satisfying for a mere spring roll. The tofu fugai is your basic fried tofu nuggets either the same sweet chili sauce and tangy mayo - not a miss but I didn't feel it was worth the price.  Be ready for a welcoming, rowdy ramen shop experience best with no more than a party of six adults. The seating is simplistic wooden stools, which is not the most comfortable. There's a bit of a wait for food as noodle bowls are made to order, so if you step in at a busy time there will be backlog. Service is as timely as it can be depending on the crowd - there's not a ton of staff and they're swamped with things to do! You're not being ignored, I promise. I've seen quite a few families here, but I really don't recommend babies or small children - there's no kids menu and the setup of the restaurant is rowdy and lots of hot soup bowls moving everywhere - you get the idea. Not a place to hang out for a long time, but perfect for fixing my ramen cravings anytime."}
{"text":"I like Guu, and Do i love big greasy bowl of ramen with few crispy gyoza! Hells yea.  So i heard mixed opinion about this place. But friend of mine said if I like tonkotsu ramen i'll love this place. Means broth will be thick, greasy and somewhat stinky with that distinctive pork bone smell. Since i'm disgusting like that I like all the characteristic of tonkotsu ramen i mentioned above. So... Hoora! I could not wait any longer.   On my 1st visit i was greeted by grumpy host (i'm also very unlucky like that) and wait out side for 30 min before i was seated in front of kitchen where I had pleasant sauna experience through out my meal. Air conditioner please! I'm sure Guu can afford one... Or five.   I got shoyu ramen with regular soup with pork shoulders, for share we got gyoza (4pcs), spicy chicken karagee (6 pcs).   1. Shoyu ramen I liked it. Soup was thicker than Kenzo and much less salty than Ajisan. Tender pork meat and half boiled egg was soft and yummy.   2. Gyoza The way they panfry it seems different from what i expected, but gyoza it self was really good. Juicy and greasy.   3. Spicy chicken karagee Oh yea, beer please!! I almost cried out loud. If it wasn't for their notorious portion I might have. Spicy sauce somehow taste bit like that rooster chili sauce in everyone's kitchen shelve, but was different. Crispy and yummy. I wish this one comes in super size.  That was my 1st visit, i don't have much to say about on my 2nd visit since I had pretty much the same experience. Eating hot noodle soup in front of gate way to hell called ramen bar.   I'd go back for food and calpico (drink) I'd think twice for waiting in line and hell like temperature. Stop seating me in front of kitchen!!"}
{"text":"I'd heart a lot about this place and finally checked it out before First Thursday at the AGO a few months ago. Go early -- it's small inside and you will likely have to wait for a table.  I had the spicy garlic ramen and it lived up to the hype. Bring mints/gum for after dinner."}
{"text":"I had the spicy pork broth with thick noodles Ramen. I also added an egg to my ramen. The broth is not too thick. It was spicy and delicious."}
{"text":"I had high expectations for this ramen place and felt kind of unsatisfied. I personally prefer Sansotei to this mainly for the soup base. I ordered the cheese ramen and fould the soup to be too strong. It's not strong in the hearty/homey way like at Sansotei, more like \"I cannot be a Kinton bowler, unless I want to sacrifice my kidney\" strong. But I'm sure the soup must be to some people's taste, just not mine. I also didn't like how the cheese ended up melting into one big block at the end. Pork belly was good in terms of flavour, but it was pretty tough and not melt in the mouth like at many other places that offer pork belly.   Service was great though! Ladies were really nice and attentive. Since I went on a rainy day they even gave me a basket to put my bag in so I don't have to drop it on the floor."}
{"text":"double pork spicy garlic allllll day. apps ain't that special though, stick to the goods."}
{"text":"Best ramen in town! Get the Tonkatsu. I got it with Chicken instead of pork. It was insanely delicious. Perfect soft-boiled egg and little strands of fennel on top. The chicken was so succulent and tender. Nice guys as well!! 5 stars all the way!!"}
{"text":"Love this place! I love the energy the chefs put into make the ramen and I love how we can see them cook while they shout in Japanese. I've tried their miso and shoyu ramen with both types of meat, and they were delicious. The noodles were well-cooked and the soup wasn't too salty, it was perfect. The pork was heavenly. I also ordered tea, which was good too, Japanese rice tea."}
{"text":"Went for lunch at 12:30 yesterday, and was seated right away.  It was LOUD and it was sweaty. The noodles themselves were probably a 4 star experience, but the dining itself was only 2 stars. There was so much shouting that I couldn't even hear the person I was sitting next to. LITERALLY. It was almost funny how many times I had to say \"...what?...\" Except it wasn't. I had been warned it was loud by my boss who had gone for a lunch meeting, but had to find a different restaurant because of the noise, but I hadn't expected it to be quite so extreme. We had to shout through the whole meal. Also, it was hot, sticky and sweaty.   I have been to Guu, and have enjoyed it very much, yelling and all. I'm not sure why it seems so much more offensive here, perhaps because it's a smaller space, and therefor a louder volume?  I also found the service to be lacking. We were immediately asked what we wanted when we sat down, and we said that we weren't ready, and hadn't had a chance to look at the menu. The waitress nodded, and then proceeded to stand behind us and wait. Very distracting. The meal came quickly, but after that it was impossible to find someone. We had to wave someone down to get a take out container as my friend could not finish her ramen (they charge 50 cents for that), someone to get us the bill, and then again to get someone to take our visa. I'd say 50% of the meal was spent trying to hail someone down.  The noodles were good, but I don't think I will be back (unless I'm eating alone, have lots of time,  and packing an advil.)  $15 for miso ramen and iced tea"}
{"text":"Amazing flavour with your choice of chicken or pork broth/meat.   I absolutely loved this place, came across it on yelp. I don't eat pork and loved that this place he chicken options.  From miso to spicy jalapeño. The flavour was so good, layered with a choice of thick or thin noodles.  Add ins included egg, scallions, garlic and etc, you can customize your 'basic' ramen with a ton of options.  Loved the service, loved the food.  You'll be greeted in some (what I assume) is a cool japanese greeting by the staff. If you're a foodie, get a seat by the cooking area so you can catch the staff making your delicious ramen."}
{"text":"I have been Kinton twice in the past year. However, I do not really like it. The space is very small inside, and there is always crowded with full of people. After spending a lot of time in queue, I have a high expectation, but I was disappointed with the Tonkotsu soup and the limited choices. I actually prefer Ramen Raijin."}
{"text":"Came twice for lunch as my work is down the street.  First time was with four ppl total, second time was for two ppl total.  Food:   Pork shoyu ramen with thick noodles. Added marinated egg, sweet corn and black garlic oil. Consistent both times. With tip I paid a little more than $20.00. I now realize how steep this is money wise for lunch, but for quality ramen I would not mind coming back for the same dish if I'm craving. I have paid similar prices at other ramen restaurants, but I normally go for dinner and don't notice the price for dinnertime.   Other ppl go pork miso ramen, chicken miso ramen and jalapeño chicken ramen. They all enjoyed the ramen and felt it was better than the north York location. One person was a first timer when it comes to ramen and I think they are now addicted.   Matcha cheesecake..  $3.50. I like that the price is low and portion is small. This way you can share with someone without over doing it. Taste wise, it was a nice cheesecake, but you can't really taste anything matcha-y.   Black sesame pudding.. can't remember the price on this. I rmb it being low. I would order this again over the cheesecake. The texture was veeeery nice and taste was good.   Service:   First time we waited five minutes for a table during the lunch rush. Second time we came a bit later and were seated right away. Both times took a bit long for the food to come out, compared to other ramen restaurants and to lunch spots in the area. I think they're just getting used to the flow of service since they just opened (therefore I did not knock off a star). We spent about an hour here both times. Everyone is very friendly as they greet you on the way in and say goodbye on the way out. You don't need to ask for water refills as they stay on top of it. They also check in to make sure everything is okay. They also bring the payment terminal and bill once they've taken the empty bowls and plates away.   Final thoughts: Ramen was great and the service was really efficient (other than the longer wait time for food to come out). Seeing as this is not too far from work, I will definitely return to this restaurant for lunch when I want ramen."}
{"text":"Great noodle joint! The miso with pork shoulder was fantastic, the mild broth was perfect, and the noodles were chewy yet tender.   The night we were there they had a special hot drink on the menu; it was Choya Umeshu Plum Liqueur mixed with hot water. Absolutely divine. Our server laughed when I ordered a third and said we can buy the liqueur at the local LCBO.   We arrived early (4:30pm) on a cold blizzardy night and the place was already getting quite busy. Would recommend arriving early."}
{"text":"Kinton Bowler 3x here.  Garlic lovers' friend's beware: this place has an awesome spicy garlic ramen. Word of warning, the taste in your mouth will last you hours after, but while you're eating it, oh man!   The fun thing about Kinton Ramen is that you can choose everything: thick or thin noodles, heavy or light soup base, pork belly or pork shoulder, add ons etc... While more expensive than other ramen places, definitely worth trying.   I got the spicy garlic ramen with thin noodles, normal soup, pork belly and added sweet corn. Drool. My fiancé luckily got a spicy garlic ramen too, so that was a free pass, otherwise - please do not order it if you're on a date!   The spiciness is perfect, no too spicy, but definitely has a kick. The garlic (yes, they serve it with a scoop of garlic) is delicious. The corn gave the spiciness a nice sweet touch. This is a pretty darn good ramen.   The shop is small (like classic Japanese ramen houses), but the wait is short. The service is excellent, quick, speedy and attentive. Can't wait to be a Kinton Bowler 4x"}
{"text":"Great service and my favourite Kinton location! Staff was extra attentive for it being busy, eggs were perfectly cooked, and the ramen is always delicious as usual. I prefer Kinton over Sansotei as Sansotei's broth is more on the salty side."}
{"text":"Awesome spot for a bowl of ramen! I really enjoyed my meal, but found the options on the menu to be limited. There weren't many customizable options and the chicken was not extremely flavorful (opted for the extra portion since I was starving). Definitely could have used more seasoning. Service was quick, courteous and attentive. Probably the best ramen spot in the area!"}
{"text":"Does not have good vegetarian options.  Also - please turn up the heat in the winter. Big glass windows do not help. Cold air blasting in winter, what is up with that!"}
{"text":"So far food is good, noodle is great soup is very tasty, just the meat is a little too salty, and when I saw the waitress cleaning the table next to me, the way she swipe the table put small pieces of food onto the chairs and floor, and she only clean the table top only. That's not a good manor for QSR ."}
{"text":"Making my way through the Kinka family of restaurants, I was invited to Kinton Ramen 5. Never having ramen at a restaurant, I thought it was just soup. Well....I was quote wrong.   First off....This location is BUSY! Go early!   Like the Kinka Izikaya locations, you are greeted by all of the staff when you arrive and when you leave. Noise level is loud, but you get used to it. Made me want to yell something too! We grabbed seats at the bar and got some delicious Sapporo. I ordered Gyoza to start and the Original Pork Ramen with thick noodles and the seasoned egg. My friend got the Hot Karaage and Spicy Garlic Pork Ramen with thick noodles and the seasoned egg.    Are you noticing a trend on the seasoned egg? GET IT. It's surprisingly delicious, you won't regret it. I eat a lot of eggs at home and I would trade all of them for seasoned eggs from Kinton Ramen.    Our bowls arrived, piled high with pork and veggies. It smelled amazing. There were so many toppings, it took me awhile to find the ramen! These are large bowls; even with an empty tummy, it was a challenge. The pork belly was fantastic; so tender and full of flavour. It was sliced very thin, making it easy to eat without splashing broth all over you.   The Hot Karaage was hot! My friend was sniffling and loved every bite. The sauce was good and hot on the fried chicken. The gyoza was crisp and drizzled with sweet chili sauce. I offered my friend one and I was secretly happy she didn't take me up on it. I heart gyoza.  We found out that if you finish the bowl, you get a photo with the super awesome enthusiastic staff. I WANTED IT SO BAD! Someone had their photo taken while we were there and we got super jealous.   Service was alright, but the place was packed! Not a seat in the house. There are lots of servers, so don't wait for the original one you talked to if you need something, they all help each other! A great vibe at this place. I've already planned my next visit!"}
{"text":"I can't get enough of kinton! So excited that they opened closer to my home!   Got to try the March special, roast beef with creamy broth was amazing! Sadly, they have a limit of 20 bowls per day at each locatio.  My usual is chicken original and they never disappoint!"}
{"text":"I was looking forward to this ramen place so convenient for me to frequent. However, I was greeted  extremely loud music, I don't know if it is just me.  I can hardly have a normal conversation.  The decor was really hip and trendy with the wood element all over the entire store.  The servers were quite attentive though.  The place started to become really busy after 12pm.  I was lucky to be able to have lunch really early today, so no waiting for table.  The menu is the same as all the other kinton ramen places I have visited.  The miso soup base was really rich but kind of on the salty side, and the pork belly meat was really juicy and flavourful.  The miso soup base ramen noodles were al dente with a slight bite to them.  I would like them to control the sodium a little bit since I felt thirsty after eating the noodles.  I usually wouldn't craze for water after ramen and drinking the soup, but they may want to under season other compoents a little bit to balance out the miso saltiness.  All in all, it was good, but not great.  I hope they do better in the near future since I would like to come back to this place."}
{"text":"After a crazy week of midterms, assignments, project and presentation, I finally felt a little more relax today.   And it is such a wet and rainy day with gloomy weather.  I love the umami taste of miso with ramen, so good and so satsifying, but Kinto really fall short of my expectations.  It was kind of condescending when I asked the server whether i can change my meal to a combo with gyoza and ramen noodle.  He was border line rude with his fool attitude.  I thought the servers in Japanese restaurants are usually really polite, but definitely not this one.  The long bench table was made out of cement with a protective layer on top which I thought was kind of interesting.  The seat I was on was really uncomfortable since the height was a little bit too high.  I guess this is to save space and there was a little compartment underneath the chair so you can pick your personal belongings.  It was functional but uncomfortable.  The servers were not really responsive, but I think it might also be due to the setup of the restaurant which may not allow a nice view of the entire restaurant from every angle.    The miso ramen noodle was really tasty.  You can really taste the ramen noodles were freshly made.  The thin ramen noodle complement the rich soup base with charred bbq pork nicely slice and plate on top of the ramen, with a few sprinkle of sesame.  It was a really nicely flavoured pork belly that has good slightly firm texture and really nongreasy.  It is a good sign that the fat has been rendered out properly.  The slight charred taste on the bbq pork was a nice accent to the overall ramen flavour profile.  On a rainy day with rich umamai was the best way to finish off my crazy day.  The gyoza was crispy on the bottom, but not so juicy on the inside. The minced pork was a little bit overseasoned but taated fresh.  To be honest, I was a little bit disappointed with the gyoza, maybe I should have stuck with plan to make the meal into a combo with a steam gyoza instead.    The use of a small bamboo case to hold the bill was a nice touch to finish; however, the servers did not provide an outstanding service, so I decided only to tip them minimally."}
{"text":"Might just be my current fav. ramen fix. Also less noisy than Guu which is good for my ears. I don't think I could ever stand in line for Ramen so very pleased when I arrived at 11:45 and didn't have to wait. (There was a line-up when I left)  You can order your ramen broth 3 ways - 1) Light, 2) Regular and 3) Rich. I love Pork bone broth! I ordered regular and still found it very rich. I went with the Shori Ramen - Pork, Nori, bean sprouts and an egg. Portion was a good size and it was delicious.  I love options. When it comes to the Pork, you can have the belly or shoulder. I went with the shoulder and loved it. The Pork was packed with flavour and you get two large pieces. The Pork belly is kind of fatty so I passed.  You can also add extra noodles for $2. Perfect for \"little\" guys like me!!!! I think the noodles are home made, definitely better than your average ramen noodle.  I also tried my friends Spicy and Garlic Ramen. WoW - this soup is screaming garlic. Get the breath mints ready. I didn't find it too spicy, just right (and I'm a light weight when it comes to spice).     We ordered the Gyoza as a starter - nothing spacial here.  Service was exceptional and fast, just like Guu. Unlike Guu, the staff screaming is turned down a notch.   I will be back for sure when I can avoid the line ups.   PS - They have another location on Bloor street.  BK"}
{"text":"Kinton does make delicious ramen, but there are just so many people here, all the time. It is impossible to get a seat, and once you do get seated you feel bad for the twenty people waiting outside the door."}
{"text":"it's been forever since i've written yelp reviews. time to contribute!!  i can only guess how many fake reviews and crappy reviews i've read. in the last two weeks i've received three inbox requests to write for $15 a pop. this isn't one of them (or is it...?) i kid.  so. kinton. well, the setting is nice and tight. it's not too loud, but still bustling. don't go here for a serious conversation... that is longer than 20 seconds or the 10 minutes waiting for seats (in my experience).   noodles. nice bite. i don't feel like points should be awarded for proper texture. having said that, mushy, overdone noodles should never, ever appear.. well, anywhere.  broth. i got a light version and my friend got the fatty version. though my sip of her broth was tasty, i felt as though a blind left-handed child had tried to slather vasoline on my lips with his right hand and then, i drank ghee.   i downed my cocktail (not memorable) to degrease my esophagus and wiped my lips down. only then could i be sure that i might actually taste my broth with a somewhat cleansed palate.  not bad. NOT \"raaaaaaaah! omg. so good. must stand in line. holy crap.\" i just don't get these food fads.  having said that. decent service, great location, and appropriate price points."}
{"text":"Maybe I just ordered the worn dish the last time I was here, but today I had the lunch special which was awesome, and a great deal.  It comes with the soup, as well as some pork and rice and a drink for $13.  I had the spicy garlic broth with pork belly.  Super yummy. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Half cooked noodles in watery flavourless soup. Extremely frustrated.  Zero stars  Looks like we still have to go to DT for a bowl of good Ramen."}
{"text":"I have been to several ramen joints in Toronto including Sansotei and Ramen Ishiin. Not to mention Ippudo, Ichiran, Bakydanya and countless others all over Japan, yet Kinton remains one of my top favs. If you've never tried Kinton before, I highly recommend you do. Keep in mind that there are several ramen styles out there, and hundreds of variations to each one, so keep trying until you find one you like. Kinton is definitely a good place to start. My favourite is the spicy garlic with pork belly. If you are feeling especially gluttonous, add cheese to it. Your belly with thank you. Your arteries, likely not so much. First timers should stay away from the \"rich\" tonkotsu broth. Too much of it can, and will happen quickly. Stick with the \"regular\" broth and thick noodles. There are a lot of non-ramen items on the menu as well. Stay away from these, not because they aren't any good, but because what Kinton does best is Ramen, and good Ramen stands up all by itself."}
{"text":"Overall - 3.0/5.0  Although they have been around for quite some time, this is actually my first time trying their ramen. They are having their soft opening right now and will be officially opening on 1/28.  Quite the contrary to Sansotei, there were no long lineups to get a table. In fact, only a few tables were occupied at the time. The ramen joint is situated right next to Grand Noodle (which is currently no longer in business).  Sansotei being my primary spot for ramen, I will draw my comparisons against it.   - Noodles: I got the thick noodles and the texture was perfect. Pretty much the same as Sansotei.  - Soup Base: I tried the original as well as the miso soup base. The original was clear and clean tasting whereas the miso was too salty and did not have much depth. I prefer Sansotei's pork bone broth with garlic oil.  - Meat: The grilled pork was larger than Sansotei's and offers both a lean and fatty cut. It was more tender and juicer than Sansotei's offering.  - Egg: This was underwhelming as it was overcooked and did not have that runny consistency that I was expecting.  - Environment: Service was attentive and welcoming. However, I did not appreciate the loud music that was blasting in the restaurant. Perhaps it would be more appropriate if it was a bar/izakaya joint but not when I am trying to enjoy my bowl of ramen!  Another thing that could be improved is the timing of the food. I thought it was quite a bit of a wait for the ramen to come (15-20 minutes) given that we were the only ones left to get our order. On top of that, the appetizer came at the same time as the ramen."}
{"text":"Kinton is a great place to eat and this location is a lot less packed than the others.  The atmosphere is great and the decor is very Japanese inspired on the inside.   The servers are friendly and I'm a big fan of their ever changing menu items monthly.  Although I have seen the giant ramen bowl challenge,  I have yet to try it.  Maybe sometime in the near future!  My favorite is the fried chicken ramen as it has some nice crispy pieces of chicken on top of their delicious ramen broth.  This along side any of their well known appetizers is a great meal for any occasion.   Overall probably one of my favorite ramen places in Toronto and it's a bonus there are usually no long waits and line ups.  The open space and less cramped table seating is a plus as well.  I will be coming back to try the giant ramen bowl challenge!"}
{"text":"In from San Francisco for work. Met coworkers here.  The spicy garlic is legit! When with pork shoulder. Also legit!  Great service. Toronto rocks. Love your town and people."}
{"text":"I went to Kinton after hearing all the rave reviews about it and had high expectations- naturally. I went for a sunday lunch and this place packed up in a matter of minutes.  I tried the lunch special with shio ramen. The noddles were fresh and the broth, deliciously deep and uncomplex. The only caveat I had with the broth was that it was on the salty side for me which caused me to be so thirsty after eating the ramen.  I would totally go back but the line up is something to consider..."}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times and it's amazing! The quality of the food is great. The washrooms are clean, but the only reason it loses a star is because it's really hard to get the attention of a waiter before you order and after you receive your food."}
{"text":"Menu - super customizable. They have chicken, pork, or vegetarian broths, different styles of noodles, and different spice combinations. There are also additional toppings you can choose from for a cost of $1-$4/each.   I had the 'original' chicken ramen - the toppings were just onions, scallions, a boiled egg, chicken breast for $13. It was very good, esp given it was a cold & windy day. Next time I think I would add on vegetables bc the bowl was pretty plain (though the broth was very good and had a lot of flavor). I ran out of toppings too quickly but it would get pretty expensive to add on several.  I think that they should offer a small size in addition to the regular. I took home about 1/3 of my ramen and was very full at the end of the meal. I could've been content with half the regular portion. What I ended up taking home was just broth and noodles. The broth was very flavourful & filling, but I would've liked more toppings.   Restaurant feel -  very clean, busy, and slightly noisy  I would go back - but probably only if i'm very hungry and in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Truly disappointed by the service of my dinner. Having high hopes from their delicious gyozas and ramen from their Queen West & Church locations that I've been to, I was stoked to try the Markham one (because it is closer to home). Sadly the dinner took 2 hours of waiting and waiting.  1. Walked in: we were greeted and told them we needed a seat for 2. Then as more people came in, they forgot about us and let others who came after us, receive a seat before us. We brought this to their attention and finally got a seat after waiting again. - Note to staff: please use the numbering system to keep track of who came when.  2. We had to get our own menus off another table since the staff was too busy to provide us with any. After figuring out what to get, it took a very long time until we could get their attention to take down our order. Told one staff and they told us to wait, told another and the same happens again.  3. After ordering, we start waiting again. Thinking maybe our appetizers are coming. But nope, tables to our left, right, and behind received their appetizers and ramen EVEN THOUGH they ordered AFTER us. The tables to our right and behind even came in and sat down after we ordered.  4. After noting this to the server, we waited again.. after an hour+ of waiting our noodles finally came.. but no we were still missing our karaage. We see orders of karaage flying out but none was ours.   5. The tables to our left, right, and behind were leaving and we were still waiting for our full order to come. When it finally came, I was literally too full from waiting.   All in all, the noodles were decent but a 2 hour dinner wasn't worth it for us. We know they are a new restaurant and we went in during a full house, but we don't think that other people who came in after us should be receiving their orders before those who walked in first."}
{"text":"I have been to Kinton Ramen quite a few times before, but tonight was by far the worst and I will not be back anytime soon. We ordered three items and they messed up two of them. The waiter claimed that our ticket was marked as \"closed\" when clearly I had not received my meal.  It was a half hour wait before I got my ramen, and our appetizer order of Karaage. They actually gave our Karaage to the patrons next to us (who arrived about 15min after us) along with the same ramen that I ordered (I suspect my order when to them, which was an understandable mistake). When we complained, the waiter had the gall to take the Karaage from the other table, and offer it to us! We had to insist he make us a new order. As for the ramen, two other orders of the same thing came out of the kitchen (it was the cold ramen) and those went to other patrons as well.  If there was a patron order was missing, wouldn't you give the next available one to complete the table order? They sent me to the back of the line and made me wait for a new one while my other the fat in my fellow diner's soup congealed.  Poor service overall, and they didn't even offer compensation. Then to add insult to injury, the waited asked if I wanted a frequent diner card.  For shame!"}
{"text":"Came here a few times and loved the ramen every time, the pork shoulder and pork belly were full of flavour and melted in my mouth! I wanted to finish the broth too since it was so delicious but for fear of stomach problems I decide not to every time."}
{"text":"I love the egg in the ramen. I like the pork broth. The original broth is salty. I like how the fat belly pork is grilled and put in your ramen."}
{"text":"One of the best ramen outside of Japan! I love the amount of garlic, live the broth! The pork belly is like a glorious, plump, juicy bacon! And I like the noodles regular size. The only reason it is 3 star and not a 5 is because of comfort! It is probably one of the most uncomfortable restaurants, also the wait time is an issue, but that I don't mind as long as I had a nice place to sit."}
{"text":"The reason I like this more then the other ramen place is the miso broth which has so much garlic in it! The last time I got the \"thin\" noodles, I found them too thin, I think the regular noodle is the best! And always pork belly! Like a thick juicy bacon lol almost but not really but it's soo good!"}
{"text":"Since I always order the spicy ramen if possible, I ordered extra pork spicy garlic ramen with extra noodles, rich broth, and half pork belly/half pork shoulder. ($16.72 after tax, or $13.33 after tax if not ordering extra pork)  Kinton probably has the best meat of all the ramen joints. The pork belly is tender and fatty, while the pork shoulder is a bit tougher but is full of flavor. The noodles are all right.  Unfortunately, the garlic completely overpowers the entire broth to the point where you think you're drinking liquid garlic bread. Also, I noticed that the traditional bowls such as Miso get an egg, but the spicy garlic does not! You have to pay an extra $1.50 for it.  If you finish your entire bowl of ramen, including broth, you get credit towards incentives. However, this place is more expensive than Kenzo and Sansotei, and almost as expensive as Santouka, so the savings are an illusion.  Finally, the environment is terrible. They blast dance music through their speakers at an abnormal volume. Every time someone comes in, they shout butchered Japanese, which my Japanese friend immediately said was garbled. He said they must've learned stock phrases.  With a poor environment, poor spicy ramen, and poor value, I cannot recommend this place at all. It's not the absolute worst ramen joint in the city when it comes to the actual food, because the meat saves it. However, for the price you pay, it's one of the worst overall experiences."}
{"text":"I ordered the traditional pork with thick noodle and green onions and nori to go. Waited about 25 mins.  not happy .  got home to find I got thin noodles not thick . not happy. paid 22 dollars . not happy. .   Won't be going back .."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the ramen here. Especially for people that don't eat pork, there are friendly options-Very flavourful. There is quite a great variety of appetizers. The staff is unique - they chant when you come in and leave the resto! Although it gets annoying and kind of disruptive every time someone enters."}
{"text":"Love the food and the experience. The staff, and the japonease \"screaming\" unfortunately I have a ear infection so it kind of got on my nerve. But I usually love it!   I went to japan many times and the food is very unthentic. I love to sit at the bar and look at the crew working so hard to that real cuisine.   Just love it!"}
{"text":"Overhyped garbage.  The sides were ok the dumplings were very good but the pork on rice looked like cat food. My wife had the Pork and Miso Ramen it tasted awful. I had the chicken with soysauce thin noodle and it was quite good.  The service was awful and staff was not helpful.  For what they charge ($13 for a bowl of soup)  the service should have been amazing.  My wife asked for a different option and they refused and were very rude, we will never return."}
{"text":"This is the best ramen place I've been to so far. I am trying to try other ramen places though. Gonna talk about the food and price.   The food here is great, I love the Takoyaki and I always get the Spicy garlic ramen. I tried the spicy garlic karaage ramen recently too. Same broth and everything, just replaced the pork with chicken. The only thing is, I know there is grated garlic in there, but it's honestly TOO MUCH. I love garlic but my breath stays garlicky for a good 2-3 days even if I try to brush it away. I do eat quite a bit but everytime, I can't ever finish or if I do, I literally can't walk. It's just so rich and filling, so I do recommend sharing and getting an appetizer just so you're not super bloated. The Takoyaki, I gotta admit, I like better than the ramen ahaha.   The price I feel is decent. Some of the other ramens I do feel is a bit pricey even when there is nothing really special or expensive added to it. Other than that, this ramen place is pretty good and consistent with how they make it."}
{"text":"got there on their opening day back in May. waited for over 1 1/2 hours for a table for 6. (should really think of it as lucky... as we left 9ish, people are still waiting to get in)  the place is small, around 30 seats? we were seated at one of the two large table, right next to the back door and kitchen door.  since we waited for so long, we ordered almost everything on the \"more\" menu.  Gyoza, it was cooled to almost room temp, and it taste like cheap frozen dumping.   Original Karaage, hot, crispy, juicy. fair size for it's price too.  Tofufurai, tofu nugget, surprisingly good... (I guess hunger does have something to do with it) but it's like a store bought item, not made by Kinton. (I think)  almost everyone opt for the extra pork, either by having the \"Kinton Pork Ramen\" that comes with the added pork, or the Cheese Ramen and then add $2 for the pork.  we had Miso, Shio, Shoyu, Spicy Garlic,  and Cheese Ramen. all of us find the soup base too salty, even the japanese/korean seats next to us find it's too salty. I don't think it would be the \"Japanese Noodle should be saltier than regular noodle\" reason. (more like the grand open day QC failed)  should try it again soon. hopefully it's better now. (now they have beer/sake...)"}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night Had the spicy garlic pork ramen and the vegetarian ramen. Also the karaage.  The vegetarian ramen was good but it really made my friend thirsty after eating it The spicy garlic pork ramen wasn't really special to me, it kinda tasted like those all you can eat sushi restaurant ramen selections. The pork was really thin and small.  I had Kinton Ramen before at another location which was much better because the pork was much thicker.  Overall, 2 stars because I had a few bites and wasn't for it and gave the rest to my friend"}
{"text":"I was so excited to try this place and managed to convince my husband to try it although he isn't huge on ramen or any soupy-foods. We were very underwhelmed. I am a huge ramen fanatic so I thought we would be in for a real treat but I was wrong. The fried chicken we ordered as an app was so drenched in oil, it was inedible. We left pieces on the plate. This has never happened before! The ramen itself was okay, at best. Not good, not bad. Just bland. We ordered with extra corn and they definitely hooked it up but the base itself was very watery and oily with no actual flavour. Chicken was flavourless. Noodles were nothing memorable. I don't think I will come back since there are so many awesome ramen options in the city. Also, the atmosphere is loud as the waiters are constantly shouting."}
{"text":"Love this place for ramen when I'm not downtown! Price is quite affordable and portion is a good size! Ramen dishes are also always very delicious. The restaurant is quite small so it is always very packed! Service is also meh. Overall, I really enjoy this place and will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"I tried the vegetable ramen. The stock was OK but love the chewy noodle. My friend had the spicy soup base with pork ramen and she love it."}
{"text":"Great, friendly service and delicious food! We were seated immediately - a table for 2 and were checked on quickly and often. We got there at a good time too - more and more folks were coming in for dinner around 5:30/6:00pm on Boxing Day.  We ordered the chicken kaarage as a starter. It was super tasty! I had a bowl of the pork ramen in miso soup base and I added corn, an egg, and nori."}
{"text":"Having watched the movie \"Ramen Girl\" I was looking forward to having an opportunity to try this exquisite dish... Unfortunately (or is fortunately?) there are too many options in TO and not having tried the dish not even once in my life I wasn't sure where to go. This is where I'm thankful to one of my Japanese friends who swore by this place!   So the first visit is a win! I can't remember the name of the appetizers but they were phenomenal. Both were chicken flavoured and simply beyond delicious. The ramen I chose was the Chicken Ramen and what a treat it was. The broth, the boiled egg, the chicken slices all blended in complete harmony. I finished mine (and got a nice little \"Kinton Bowler\" button and ended up eating half of my wife's ramen too. Yup, they're that good!   The staff is friendly, attentive and efficient. The décor is simple but cozy, although I wasn't too fond of the loud music and all the noise. Prices are pretty good too. Definitely going back for more and will try different to ramen next time."}
{"text":"This was by far the worst meal of my life. I ubereats ordered vegetarian ramen, they gave me plain veg broth on the side, literally just broth with ramen, hand full of sprouts, 1 spoon of sweet corn and that was 15 bucks. I am so sad I spent that money.. Kenzo ramen instead provides so much more than plain broth, how about you put some flavors in there? Huh? Do not eat here if you're vegetarian"}
{"text":"Kinton was probably one of the first \"authentic\" ramen shops to pop up in Toronto other than your Kenzo's and Ajisen's.  As I understand it, the lines are still pretty long.  Small restaurant.  They've really added a twist to some of their menu options such as a \"cheese ramen\", \"garlic ramen\" and a salad.  This keeps things interesting and customers coming back.  I personally opt for the classic shoyu or shio.  The broth is salty and filling.  You can request for less lard and salt too.  You have the option of pork shoulder or belly.  The shoulder I found to be on the dry side.  The karage and gyoza are great side options.  Sapporo is on tap.  The wait staff and cooks are all Japanese, which means they'll yell hello and thank you when you come and leave and are extremely friendly.  If you drink all your broth, they'll take a picture of you and post it to their facebook page.  Personally, I've never been back since Santouka opened."}
{"text":"We chose to go to Kinton Ramen primarily because we knew they'd have air conditioning, but also because there have been decent reviews. I don't see what all the hype is about, to be honest.   We discussed further, trying to pinpoint what exactly we didn't like otherwise. The meat portions were diminutive but decently cooked. The broth seemed to be comprised of salt and not too much else. The noodles, I have to admit, were cooked perfectly. I think what got me riled up was the pricing system and how it impacts the dish. My friend hit the nail on the head when he said it was just \"too much of just one thing\".   Add-ons are $1.00 - $6 each. Without add-ons, one receives an oversized portion of a very bland bowl, and with add-ons, one may receive an oversized portion of a potentially more interesting bowl which will fill the tummy but empty a wallet. Service was spotty and inattentive. Yawn.  I didn't even finish my bowl -- and those who know me would know this is uncharacteristic behaviour. Afterwards, we walked over to Yogurty's to try to combat all the salt with some sweet."}
{"text":"Great ramen! I've missed ramen since moving fro. San Diego and the LA area where the ramen was amazing. So I'm really happy that I've finally found a spot that competes. It's not the best ramen I've ever had, but the shoyu pork bowl I had was up there on my list. I had corn and extra noodles. You can choose between thick or thin noodles which is a great option. My one negative would have to be they put a huge sheet of seaweed in it, far too much for my liking. Last time I was here I just split it in half so no big deal.  One thing to keep in mind is that they don't have a large selection of drinks, they only have one beer I think and some generic brand of sake I think."}
{"text":"I would say they serve good ramen and exceptional marinated eggs! I feel its the same quality as Santosei with Santouka a clear first for me. The pork was really tender. The broth was tasty. I was just annoyed with all the shouting from the servers to greet people when they arrive and leave."}
{"text":"They have a vegetarian version! We happened to walk by this ramen restaurant and notified they had a vegetarian version on the menu. As someone who loves ramen but haven't had had good vegetarian ramen since becoming vegetarian, this place hits the spot. The noodles are nice and tendu with the perfect amount of juiciness. The soup was light but very flavourful, and the tofu patty they had was extremely delicious and flavourful. The best part is their kinton bowler stamp card. Every time you finish an entire bowl you get a stamp! Now there is one other place where the soup is better but this place has 5 locations and is easy to get to. I would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Great Ramen - pork belly was unreal on first visit and mediocre on second."}
{"text":"This restaurant features an authentic Japanese style layout. When you come in, the chef and servers yells \"welcome\" in Japanese.   You select your broth, meat and noodle in a sequence. You pretty much have to come in very early to get a spot. Otherwise, you won't find a spot.   Food here is pretty good. I ordered salty pork base soup with thick noodles and an extra egg. I highly recommend to order extra noodles because regular is just not enough. The egg is done just right (not too soft not too hard). Noodles also have the necessary al dente feel.   However, be careful of the order. It is known that they can get the order wrong and you'll end up eating the wrong thing."}
{"text":"I went there twice by my own. Pros - ramen chef has spirits and professionalism - good bgm - average waiting time (from seat to serve ur order ) during weekday lunchtime is ~15min - serivice quality is great  Cons - I personally think the soup is not strong enough for Tonkotsu and Miso Ramen - the seasonsed egg's is not salty enough"}
{"text":"Came to sushi next door for dinner but was so hungry so ended up here, then walked about to sushi place to get drinks. The ramen here was probably the best I've ever had. Ordered the spicy noodles. Staffs were extra nice. Nice atmosphere"}
{"text":"Decent all-vegetarian ramen. It wasn't out-of-this-world delicious, but it was good. The portion size was very generous that I could barely finish the bowl. The restaurant has a cosy, cute atmosphere. I could imagine that it would be noisy if every table was filled. My bowl was $11 + $1 for an egg, which I think is a fair price."}
{"text":"I waited for 1.5 hrs in line when kinton first came to Toronto to try it. Over the years the quality has fluctuated a bit and sometimes it feels like they relied a bit too much on gimmick (different flavors and mega bowl challenges) to stay relevant. That being said, this location is on point. Perfectly balanced. I will say my egg was a bit overdone but my friends egg was great. Their spicy garlic broth is still top tier. I also love that it's a bit out of the way and with all the construction on Eglinton, it's been pretty easy to get seated quickly."}
{"text":"Finally, authentic ramen place opens in North York. However this location is very small really only good for parties of 2-3. Bigger parties should come early or go at off hours.   Been to the one downtown, unfortunately this one seems not as good. I tried the shoyu soup w pork shoulder. The soup is not too rich even though I asked for rich just tastes like diluted soya sauce. Seems like way too much garlic in the soup I don't recall them having this downtown. Otherwise the noodle is good. My friend ordered the shio soup seems to be more flavourful. I ordered the pork shoulder which is way leaner than pork belly, but a little dry.  Overall good place for a quick bite cause the turnover is quite fast. And the ramen is alright."}
{"text":"Went on a Friday around 1:30pm, and it wasn't busy at all. I've been here a couple of times and the servers are always nice. They are attentive and quick to serve. The food came out fast as well. I ordered the ramen combo which comes with a free appetizer. I ordered the pork ramen with spicy garlic broth with thin noodles. For my appetizer, I ordered the gyoza. I would rate the ramen taste 3/5, and the gyoza 4/5."}
{"text":"Truly amazing.  The ramen was great (I got the spicy pork)! The spicy fried chicken was also delicious and a definite must-have if you enjoy spicy foods!  The service was a little slow when I went but I did go on the opening day.    All-in-all delicious and will go back!"}
{"text":"Great place. I went during lunch time and got a seat at the counter. Don't be shy, people won't be obnoxious trying to talk to you and it's fun seeing them prepare the ramen. The service was good, especially during such a busy time. The ramen was delicious, my mouth waters thinking of it and it was beyond filling.  Space wise, it's not very spacious, might be a problem if you have a baby carriage or something. Biggest problem for me sitting at the counter was he lack of hooks under it for stuff. The stools don't have back support so I was kinda awkward with my bag and I saw other people struggling with their jackets and bags. Noise level it is super lively and here's shouting all the time, I liked the energy but you might not but this is something you should expect."}
{"text":"We were not full after eating at Guu / Kinka so we decided on Round two at Kinton Ramen.   This is a great place to get a good sized bowl of ramen.   I would recommend you try the Pork Shoyu Ramen with pork belly."}
{"text":"The first word I can think of to describe this new Kinton Ramen joint is: slooooooooooow.   The restaurant is fairly new as it had its grand opening a few weeks ago.   The wait to get a table was decent on Valentine's day but once you sit down, that's when the real wait begins.   After placing our order, we had to wait a good 20 minutes before our first appetizer arrives.   Another 15 minutes slowly goes by... Hungry is turning into hangry... The Ramen finally arrives.   After quickly slurping down half the bowl, our second appetizer arrives.      Word of caution:  flag someone down quickly and order ASAP to minimize your wait time!   Kakimayo:  when Guu first opened, their kaki mayo was legit, full sized baked oyster.   Nowadays the shell houses chopped up pieces of oyster and mushrooms.   Mushroom to oyster ratio is 1:1.  Not really great for $4.50  Hot Kaarage:  fried chicken with hot sauce.   If I had to order it again, I'd get it without the hot sauce.  The fried chicken tonight is a bit on the dry side.   I probably wouldn't get this again.     Spicy extra ramen:  with triple the meat, it better be filling!   Luckily it was.   I had to give a slice or two to my husband so he ended up with 4x the meat.   The broth is comparable to other Kinton locations.   The Ramen was cooked well, very springy (if that is a proper Ramen description).  Unlike other Kinton locations, you don't get the option to choose how rich your broth is.   The only downside was the pork was cold.     No pictures were taken because a) there's more than enough photos on Yelp and b) I waited long enough to get my food that my camera was definitely not eating first.   I hope the staff can get used to their set up soon.   The wait staff appeared  pretty lost half the time.   They didn't know where the food was going nor did they know the table numbering system.    Expect a long (sober*) wait time when you come to this location.   *no llbo license yet, so don't let the Sapporo tap fool you.   Two and half stars (for now)."}
{"text":"Very good ramen in my opinion. Have tried the spicy garlic and original with pork and enjoyed both. Not too salty-like a lot of ramen is to me but has great flavors. That seasoned egg - to die for."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times - the first time because of the hype, the subsequent times because friends wanted to try it. Really, not worth the wait, in my opinion. I'd come here again if there was no line.   The atmosphere is full of energy, the service is quick and friendly once you're seated. Love that there are baskets to put your bags at your feet at the tables where you're basically rubbing elbows with your neighbour the entire time you're eating.   The best thing about the ramen is the beautifully cooked egg with the runny golden centre. The pork is bland, the noodles perfectly done. For a meal that's so dependent on porky goodness, I really just think the meat and broth miss the mark on my taste buds."}
{"text":"Kinton is OK. I didn't love the Baldwin location, and this location doesn't quite measure up to the hype either.   We waited about 5 minutes and got a seat. I had the vegetarian Ramen,  which came in a much larger looking bowl than the regular Ramen. Loaded with nori,  bean sprouts, Napa,  corn, one piece ofm mushroom and 2 pieces of something fried, it hit the spot on a chilly winter's night. It was decent, just not good enough for me to have a craving for it again. The ton ton don, was a surprising cold chopped up pork bits on a mini hill of rice and green onions.  It was actually quite good. Wasn't  expecting the meat to be cold, and but I kind of liked it! The spicy chicken karage was meh.   Maybe they were understaffed as it took 2 long tries to get water."}
{"text":"This was a little hole in the wall ramen shop that I almost walked past when I was looking for it. It took about 20 minutes to be seated and I was led to a bar seat right in front of the small kitchen area. I absolutely recommend this spot as you get a front row view of all the enthusiastic chefs bustling about in the kitchen, doing little energetic dances and hollering with every order. The vibe of this place felt very much like that of ippudo in new York where everyone shouts as customers and orders come and go.   I ordered the shoyu ramen with regular broth and pork belly. The soup was a little salty so I might try going with the light broth next time, but everything about it was still absolutely delicious. The egg especially was a perfectly cooked sift booked egg that was tender and just slight runny in the core of the yolk.  I also ordered a drink on the recommendation of my friendly waiter (who was Caucasian but seemed to speak a fluent amt of Japanese!). I can't recall the name but it was a white, milky consistency and was sweet with a tinge of sour. It's a bacterial mix (dont be alarmed; think yogurt) that was a less sweet version of the mini sized yogurt drinks you can find in Asian markets."}
{"text":"This place is attached to Kinka Izikaya, which is only open after 5 as we discovered to our dismay at 4:30 with the weather turning. So we had some ramen instead. Pretty darn good in either miso or spicy garlic broth, thick or thin noodles."}
{"text":"My favourite Ramen place.  Price is relatively average, around 10-14$ for a bowl of ramen.  Interior design and bathrooms are very nice but the restaurant is relatively small and busy.  But ramen is delicious and tastes authentic!"}
{"text":"I went there with a friend and ordered takoyaki, karaage, orginal pork ramen with regular broth and thick noodle. Takoyaki -- For some of you who expect that it's freshly made using takoyaki pan, you might be disappointed.  This is deep-fried. How does it taste? Well, not bad, but ...about average.  Karaage -- Liked it.  Crispy but juicy inside, not oily at all. Definitely recommend it.  Ramen --  Not sure if this is really delicious... I find it hard to taste the sweetness of the pork broth, all I have is the overly saltiness.  It comes with a soft-boiled egg, which is really nice.  The pork shoulder itself is ok too.  Noodle and broth is not my favorite type.   However, my friend did mention that this is better than Ramen Raijin.  Was I satisfied after this meal? Yeah..kind of.   Will I come over again?  Probably not"}
{"text":"Pretty decent ramen! It's a smaller location than the one in Richmond Hill and downtown, but its roomy enough. Having ordered the Shoyu Pork Ramen, I was glad to find that the pork was nice and tender, closer to the fatty side. However, I did find the soup to be slightly too salty and thick to be a broth. The Spicy Garlic Pork Ramen had a nice spicy kick to it, with the same tender pork meat. The Original Chicken Ramen was slightly on the bland side, but is a good alternative should you not be able to eat pork. Alright portion sizes; closer to pricey given that quantity. Standard quality, like any other chain of ramen"}
{"text":"Thoroughly mediocre, the noodles were good, the broth okay, but I won't be planning my trip back.   The Karaage chicken was good, but do me a favor and don't order it spicy, the hot sauce is too westernized :-/  It's ok..."}
{"text":"Decided to check this place out after seeing the ad on Blogto! Bonus that its close to my area! Arrived early in the afternoon so it wasn't too busy. Ambience was really nice and the staff was very attentive . They helped describe each ramen dish and which they thought was best depending on what I liked. The ramen was cooked just right and the flavor was on point. Ordered the gyoza and karaage which was good too but the Ramen is what really stood out the most.Would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Great food... Spicy fried chicken and seasoned egg with your ramen highly recommended..."}
{"text":"I got the spicy chicken ramen. The soup and noodles and veggies were great! My only issue was the chicken. It was like ground up and made into a patty to look like a slice chicken breast. The texture was weird. I've never been a fan of processed meat so this was really disappointing, as the rest of meal was great. I will go back but I will more than likely skip the meat and add more veggies!"}
{"text":"This is perfectly fine ramen. I still prefer Miso-Ya one block away for its greater flavor depth. The atmosphere and service are both much nicer at Kinton."}
{"text":"I heard lots of good things about it before i went.  I went on friday night around 6:30pm and ended up waiting for an hour ish to get a seat  for two people.  The ramen was okay. However,  it was not that amazing and not worhty for waiting for an hour.  i dont mind going back if there is no-line up."}
{"text":"They opened at 5.00. It was nicely decorated but the seats were uncomfortable.  Menu is confusing.  Service could have been better. The soup was very tasty but  a little oily. The belly pork was very fatty with only one piece of meat. I needed more. The gouda was decent"}
{"text":"Kinton is definitely one of the better ramen places I've been too. The broth is very flavorful and the pork is always cooked to perfection. You can customize your ramen in so many didn't combinations too. I usually go for the extra pork ramen, but ask for pork belly and pork shoulder. And I always like to add seaweed. I've been to three locations, and this one is my least favourite. Because it is so close to UofT, this place is always packed with students and the space is just too small, you can't move your elbows after you sit down. Service is EXTREMELY slow, they even forgot to bring us water after we sat down. I would recommend Kinton, but try another location as there are a few downtown."}
{"text":"Opening Day Line-up was not too bad. More Ramen options in Mississauga is always good. Kinton's broth is less salty than Kenzo, but any garnishing you want is extra and can quickly add up. Overall a pleasant experience. Kinton quality is consistent across locations."}
{"text":"I'm really not sure why there's so much hype around ramen, but I went to try out this place anyway.  The portion size is good but there's really nothing outstanding about the place.  I guess I'm a bit biased because I don't really care for ramen much. The one thing i can say that was GREAT was the seasoned egg.  Even if my bowl already comes with one i will always order a second one.  It is cooked to perfection, the yolk is not runny but just right. i would legit just go back so i could have the egg with my noodles."}
{"text":"Good, and by good, I mean very good.  Had the ordinary pork ramen (can't remember what they call it in the menu). No fuss, no frills, two pieces of pork \"char siu\" and a soft boiled soy egg, a slight 'drizzle' of green onions. I personally like my ramen with all the fixins' so this was a bit bare bones. The real winner here is the broth: milky creamy smooth, and most importantly *not a horse's salt lick*. Holy shitake mushrooms, why do so many ramen places insist on giving their clientele a salt hangover?  I'm sure there's a proper name for it, but the service staff shout greetings as you enter and leave, but they're not annoying about it like at Imadake; service was super friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"While discussing where to eat, it came to light that I could not remember the last time that I had ramen. I then realized that I couldn't recall if I had ever had it! So after ample ridicule from the group, we made our way to Kinton Ramen.  Kinton is a chain of ramen restaurants, with this particular location in a plaza at Leslie and Highway 7. The medium sized restaurant has table seating with benches, and other tables with stools, so get ready to work on that posture. The browns and blacks of the space give it a mellow vibe, and you'll find the Kinton pig logo emblazoned in the surroundings.  When you walk into the restaurant you may or may not notice people yelling for no immediately apparent reason. After sitting for some time, you'll notice that upon the arrival and departure of anyone to & from the restaurant, the chefs hollar out some sort of greeting or farewell. It's a fun, yet confusing touch that may amuse you or entice you to yell back. Your choice.  We started with sides of edamame, karaage (Japanese style fried chicken), and takowasabi. The edamame was fine, and the karaage was nice, but I was nudged to fandom by that God send takowasabi. The name of the dish instructs you that you are intended to use the small sheets of seaweed to create a taco with the zesty octopus & wasabi stem mixture. I loved being presented with a lively sweet flavour, and then just as I thought I had a handle on things, being slapped with a hit of wasabi heat. And believe me, they don't play around with that serving of wasabi. They're fighting the good fight against under-seasoned food!  As for my possibly first ramen experience, I kept the spicy party going with their spicy garlic pork ramen. The ramen is served in a sizeable bowl along with a handy spoon/ladle, so no need for the usual noodle slurp-fest. Once you mix the garlic mound into the deep orange broth, you'll enjoy a lightly spicy broth that wonderfully complements the substantial amount of noodles swimming below. It's a little bit of a shame that the pork itself didn't quite meet the deep and comforting flavours of the rest of the bowl. I didn't get the sense that it was all that fresh. Regardless, I ate happy that day.  I encountered a well appreciated touch when I went to the bathroom and saw the decor. They keep to the dark walled theme, and you'll find that Kinto pig even in there, etched into the mirror. They've also got tooth picks and mouthwash in there. So feel free to bring a date, devour that spicy garlic ramen, and still leave fresh.  Overall, I'm a fan of this place. The food is great, and the simple decor is purposeful and well thought out. I could personally do without the staff yelling at me, but if that's the price of good ramen, count me in."}
{"text":"I'm very disappointed for my first Kinton experience. I heard so much about it and decided to go when they open up a new location close to my apt. I got rich soup base, thick noodle with pork. When I think rich soup I expect rich in flavor but not drink pork fat and you can actually see the fat floating on top. The soup base itself lack in flavor. Pork was ok, bit cold. I had way better ramen on yonge and this is probably the worse I had. Would not go back again."}
{"text":"Went in in the evening and easily got a seat for two.  Ordered the shio broth and pork shoulder and it was very moist and tender unlike most pork served with these ramen dishes in the Gta.  Recommended to return and try the different combinations as sadly the daily deal was sold out."}
{"text":"The downtown location is better and I not sure why.  The portions seems to be smaller and I am always feeling hungry after eating ramen here.   If you want to skip the line for some Japanese ramen then by all means come here.  The spicy karaage was decent. Fried to perfection and smothered in spicy sauce. The ramen tasted okay but the broth from the downtown store is better."}
{"text":"Stopped by here to meet a friend for dinner. There was no wait so that was good! I ordered the spicy garlic ramen with pork - thin noodles.  I thought it was decent. I haven't gone for ramen for a long time. Therefore I didn't know that all the 'toppings' needed to be added for an extra cost. I would say toppings is what makes ramen, ramen - like the egg, corn etc.  For $10.99, I kind of went home hungry but it is what it is. To me, the overall noodles just tasted 'ok' - but I had good company and service so I guess that was a plus."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been to 3 of their locations and their ramen is consistently good. I have tried a couple of variations but the best is the spicy garlic. Portions are huge and the apps are decent. Seating is limited so arrive at non-peak hours to make sure you get a seat."}
{"text":"Tried one week ago, and ordered the Spicy Garlic Pork Ramen with thin noodle. The soup was tasty, but the noodle wasn't well cooked and the pork was too salty. Also, the bowl didn't feel like a complete dish, just a sum of parts. Given the hype and how many locations have opened up over the years, thought it was just OK."}
{"text":"Delicious ramen!   It's HUGE. I shared one and I was super full after it.  I tried the miso with chicken. I also ordered scallions and they were really good!  Can't wait to go back in a cold day and try the original one."}
{"text":"It was okay, some highlight components but wouldn't go back. Service was top notch.  I ordered the pork ramen combo w rich soup, thin noodle, w gyoza on the side. The gyoza was DELICIOUS. I don't know what japanese cusine was like before mayonnaise was invented but I'm sure glad it's part of it now.  The ramen overall was meh, I've had better. The egg topping was extra, everything was standard. I got the pork shoulder and they torched it right in front of me. It was pretty good! Otherwise I descovered the rich soup was VERY rich, like with chunks of fat in it. It was a lot a lot a lot of food. I had an overall pleasant experience but I do like the Hokkaido place down on dundas better."}
{"text":"It's a small place with casual atmosphere. Ramen is great, good and rich tasting. Service is pleasant. Loved the macha cheesecake."}
{"text":"Went here a couple of times either alone or with co-workers/friends.  Was great food every time we went. I mostly have the classic pork ramen and sometimes the chicken karaage, takoyaki and desert. The only time I wasn't satisfied was when I tried their chicken ramen. The texture of the chicken seemed like rubber to me and it didn't look natural, too.  That's why I call it the plastic chicken which seems to become more and more popular among restaurant chains etc.(I will keep my hands off that stuff for sure).  Another thing I noticed is that the quality of their service is not always the same and it seems to differ from location to location. Also, there's often a long line up in the evenings.   Anyway, it's a good place for delicious pork ramen (not chicken).  Note: I have never been to Japan to eat real ramen."}
{"text":"Broth was lukewarm and bland ask them to make it hot which they did but had to wait extra 5 to 10 min for it. Only one piece of pork belly for $10 or more for a bowl of Ramen soup. Place is tiny so even if you put 2 to 3 people in there it would look jam pack . Open concept kitchen is nice but food is just average. Their soup base for Ramen  is not braise with pork or beef bone/marrow, i feel its not as healthy as chinese,viet and korean soup. Won't return because it's far from where I lived and not my cup of tea."}
{"text":"Quality of ingredients was the immediate impression I got out of my original pork ramen with seaweed, garlic, and scallions. The seaweed and scallions were incredibly fresh and gave another dimension of taste as opposed to blending in with the broth. I mixed the whole scoop of grated garlic into the broth which proved to be overpowering so I would reserve some on the side. The thick noodles had perfect firmness. The melt-in-your-mouth pork and seasoned egg were the best I have ever tasted in a ramen. The only thing that didn't stand out for me was the broth but there are many more highlights.  Excellent space in a new building with a spacious tarrasse. Ramen is expensive to eat every day otherwise I would become a Kinton Bowler in no time!"}
{"text":"Not worth the line.  This place was good when it first opened. But to be honest now it's loud, long lineups and salty food have been replaced by a better joint on the block.  I found the soups all are way too salty. You need to order beverages in order to kill the excessive mouth watering. Their overuse of fatty pork although tasty does not complement the excessively salty soup. It's nice when you get Ramon that has a fantastic flavourful broth and the salt comes from bits of fantastic pork. This place is as if someone took a salt shaker and mixed it with hot water.  If I were you explore the other Ramon choices on the street. (Hint same side of Baldwin middle of the block)"}
{"text":"I love the original ramen. They aren't my favorite ramen in Toronto but they are close."}
{"text":"A menu without allergens listed on it leaves someone like me, allergic to peanuts, the choice of leaving or trusting the server/staff. I took a risk and lost, got a dose of peanut from the sauce at the bottom of the Green Salad. Neither I nor Kinton Ramen did our due diligence here, I should not have risked it and they should have more information available to customers in hard copy. Too much can be lost in language, thankfully there was an Emergency Room at Bathurst and Dundas. Not a safe place to eat for those with Anaphylaxis."}
{"text":"This place has BOMB ramen and spicy chicken karaage! I always go here for their Pork ramen, Thick Noodles, Corn, Half Cooked Egg & Seaweed! I bring my friends here and they recommend it as well. The only problem we had with our last visit was that we waited an hour for our spicy chicken karaage after we've finished all of our ramen. We did remind them at least 3 times, but they kept forgetting about it. We paid for our meals and still haven't got our karaage... Eventually we got it but it was so frustrating."}
{"text":"When talking about ramen in downtown area, I always recommend Kinto Ramen to my friend. I'm a big fan of their thick noodle and classic pork broth.  I've been to this location several times and everytime I enjoyed the ramen as well as the friendly service there. But today I wanna mention a bad service experience there. I went there with my friend. A tall young guy served us. Each of us order a ramen and after discussion we decide a to add an appetizer tako wasabi(very fresh tasty wasabi flavour tako. It's actually very good if there is nothing happens next)  Couple of minutes later, the tako came and our ramen right after. We started to have our ramen, and the server brought a hot chicken karage which we did not order. I thought he may be give it to the wrong table and I told the server immediately.   The guy become so rude.He said I'm 100% sure you order this.Huh....I'm also 100%sure I did not order the karage. I tried to explain that the order were decided by both of us. One appetizer is enough and we don't want to waste food. So there is no possibility two appetizers are ordered by us. My friend also said we didn't order. Then he argued impatiently I don't understand you....excuse me, is this the way how you serve the guest? At last he took the karage away with a very unpleasant face.  I felt very upset and this definitely affected the whole dinning experience. Seriously I'm not the kind of person who is very critical to the service. I enjoyed the ramen there and I don't expect to much about the service in a ramen place. I don't mind paying $5.9 for the appetizer but the server's way of pushing me makes it unacceptable to us.  Anyways the ramen there is highly recommended hopefully you will be served by the girls"}
{"text":"I went there yesterday around 3 o'clock on a weekday and I'm so surprised that this place is almost full. I guess the business owner must be very happy lol  Wonderful ramen place. Spicy garlic is a very good choice if you prefer the thick and strong taste of your broth. I like the pork belly very much. chick chick don is also tasty."}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner during my recent Montreal visit.  I had the soy-based soup base with pork, thick noodles, seasoned egg, and scallions, and found it to be a delicious and satisfying bowl of soup.  Service was solid as well.  I'd certainly return."}
{"text":"The staff were super friendly and the soup was great. The location itself is really small however which made it feel a bit cramped."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch today. When I entered I was promptly greeted hello by the chef behind the glass. The waitress was also friendly and service was on point. I decided to have the spicy karaage as a starter and I got the original pork ramen. My meal was very good the only problem was that my ramen didn't come with the egg as mentioned in the description. So apparently now the egg is a side option so that will cost you extra. Other than that it was a great meal and good service."}
{"text":"I came here with two friends this past week for lunch and suprisingly the line-up wasn't that long ( I guess we beat the lunch crowd).  Upon being called for seating, we were escorted to the bench area that was directly from the kitchen.  We sat directly across the glass pane where all the huge pots of soup/stock were constantly being boiled.  Note to everyone: try to avoid these seats...you'll be guaranteed to have a sweaty meal.  Now onto the food, I ordered the chicken kaarage and the shoyu ramen with light broth and pork shoulder.  The chicken was amazingly good!  Juicy, tender and just the right amount of seaoned crispiness.  The mayo sauce (I think) that it came with for dipping was also to die for...I could probaly spread this stuff over everything because that's how good it was.  The ramen itself was a huge heaping bowl of noodles and soup.  I found the consistency of the ramen to be chewy and fresh as expected of a ramen joint.  The pork shoulder was okay, all I tasted was saltiness.  There wasn't much dimension with the flavour.  The miso soup was tasty, I managed to finish most of it, before I reached my capacity.    If I was to compare it to Kenzo, I think I would still have a slight preference towards Kenzo, there is just something extra tasty with their version of Ramen.  My next adventure would be to try Sensotei Ramen, which just happened to open directly across from Kenzo on Dundas St. W.  I wonder how this place will fare."}
{"text":"I went to Kinton Ramen after work on a Friday.  The quality of the ramen and broth was pretty good but falls short compared to other places, such as Sansotei.  I got spicy garlic ramen with pork and an egg.  The broth was creamy and the level of spice was perfect for me!  The noodles, however, were a little too hard for my liking.  Overall, I thought it was pretty good and I don't have any real complaints.  For an appetizer I got the Age Gyoza.  The gyoza themselves were good but the sauce really made it delicious!  It's almost like a spicy mayo.  Based on quality alone I'd rate the ramen and gyoza 4/5 but the price wasn't quite right.  The spicy garlic ramen comes with bean sprouts and garlic.  Pork/chicken is extra at $2.50.  I also added an egg for another $1.50.  Unfortunately, the price of the ramen ($15) is a good $5 more than Sansotei, so I wouldn't have any reason to choose Kinton over Sansotei.  Overall, Kinton offers good quality ramen and delicious gyoza!  But when comparing to Sansotei, there's no competition in my opinion."}
{"text":"Service was fast and courteous. Menu was simple and easy to order from.  The food was ready in about 15 mins. It was great to sit at the bar and watch the cooks prepare the ramen. I ordered chicken miso and my man ordered jalepeno chicken with extra hot sauce. Mine was super bland so I had to add hot sauce and soy sauce.  Tips : it's pretty plain ramen if you don't order the egg and veggies etc. Which they charge $1 for.  We were stuffed and enjoyed our meal. They yell something in Japanese when someone arrives or leaves the restaurant!"}
{"text":"Garlic breath! Sure, it may repel the opposite sex on dates, friends at parties and vampires at night, but that won't stop me from happily slurping up my ramen at Kinton Ramen as it's definitely one of the better places for Ramen in TO.   With varying levels of spiciness and garliciness, Kinton serves up a delicious and authentic bowl of Ramen that will satisfy your ramen cravings. With nicely cooked, al dente-eque (it's Toronto, so i can mix cultural terms right?) noodles that retain a good texture and just enough chewiness, complemented by flavorful broth and your typical ramen toppings (egg, garlic, pork, green onion, etc.). Several different ramen bowls are available - but you can always add/remove toppings as well.  It does get quite busy (on Sunday afternoons at least) so if you're going during prime time be prepared to wait.   Side note: I love the angular wooden walls, I'm definitely going to try to steal the idea someday."}
{"text":"Amazing ramen! And the prices are very affordable too. The place is very clean, truly Japanese."}
{"text":"Kinton ramen was mediocre... Nothing too surprising here. Small place, cant see it hosting large groups.   Their spicy chicken they had i felt was better than the ramen i got.   The service was great, open concept to where you can watch them make noodles and get our water from the tap."}
{"text":"No wonder there are so many locations of Kinton Ramen - their broth is the best!  It is so flavouful, that I had to talk about it in my first sentence.  It is very rich in flavour.  I only tried the original but that was enough for me to say that \"Yes, I am a fan\"  I got the original broth, with pork, thick noodles.  It came w/ 2 thick slices of pork, which was enough although I would appreciate it if there was more meat.  There's a piece of seaweed and then you get some onions and diced up vegetables within the soup.  Oh...one more thing, I got the egg too! That was a nice surprise, the egg is made perfectly, the yolk is not runny but it is not dry either, they somehow found the perfect temperature and timing to make this crazy amazing thing called an egg that goes perfectly with the noodles and soup and everything.  One negative thing is that you may expect to wait for a table, we had to wait about 15 minutes for a party of 2.  Oh, and their chairs aren't that comfortable but don't worry, you'll be too busy slurping the noodles down your tummy to think about the chair.  Last note - finish your bowl and you get a Kinton Bowler card! It's their reward system, you collect one stamp everytime you finish the whole bowl, including the soup!  THe more stamps, the more rewards you get.  I think for 10 bowls, you get a dish of Gyozas! It can go up to 1000 bowls.  Mad props for those who get that far!  Expect to pay between $10-15 for a bowl."}
{"text":"Who doesn't crave ramen on a cold winter day?  Ok, make that everyday ala Tampopo Japanese ramen western style.  Rich tonkotsu shio ramen and takoyaki.  That was a mighty fine bowl of goodness.  Seriously.  Friendly efficient service and hooks under your table to hang your coat or purse.  How efficient is that?!  Can't wait to repeat the experience...."}
{"text":"I thought this place was just ok...maybe I went on an off day?  I got the miso with pork belly and a seasoned egg with a side of gyoza.  The gyoza was a little oily on the outside and it was warm, not piping hot, but it tasted good, but it did have a lot pf pieces of fat floating in it.  I wasn't totally into the ramen noodles, my friend liked them because they were a little bit more firm than the ramen place we went to a few days ago, so I let them sit for a bit to soften up a bit.  Broth was good, but temperature was a little on the cool side.  What confused me was that I watched them prepare my ramen, and I can see that the water is hot because there is steam coming off of it in the kitchen area, but when I was eating it, it was just luke warm.  I saw the cook using a blow torch to char the pork belly, I thought that it was going to be awesome...but it was a little cold in the centre, and my piece was only lightly browned on one side.  The staff are all super super nice, but I was just not impressed with the food.  Maybe my expectations were very high because this place shows up on many \"Top Ramen Places in Toronto\" lists."}
{"text":"My friends and I visited on Halloween to get Kinton's IT's (the movie) inspired ramen which consisted of a miso broth with thick noodles, beansprouts, porkbelly, seasoned egg, garlic oil, takoyaki, hot sauce, and shredded red pepper. The location was full with a short wait time like all Kinton locations I have visited.  The pork belly was DELICIOUS. It was juicy and super flavourable. The seasoned egg was not fully cooked, which is my favourite for hard boiled eggs. The takoyaki, however, was soggy (makes sense since it was in the broth) but it contained a few diced octopus pieces. The meal was almost good but the size was small and I would have preferred if the broth was richer. I've had Kinton's other ramen bowls and they are small too so it was no surprise. I think Kinton strives for quality more than quantity but it's important in case you want something to fill you up, not just a nice photo (I'm guilty!)."}
{"text":"A knock off of Guu atmosphere. The wife and I had some expectations and were very disappointed and left hungry.  Service was terrible and got stuck seated right next to another couple.  My mama always said if you can't say anything nice, don't say anything at all. Bleh."}
{"text":"The chicken breast was soft and flavourful and the noodles were just the right texture. The price isn't too bad but the serving size is smaller in comparison to other ramen places and the seaweed, egg, and chicken that comes with the ramen is actually pretty small in quantity so after finishing that (pretty quickly) it's just noodles and the soup. Overall, the ramen was really good and I would go back."}
{"text":"I would have to stay this place has the best ramen I've ever had. Everything I've eaten at this place has been perfect. The atmosphere is cosy has soon as you walk in the door your greeted by all the staff and the same when you leave. The tables are a little small and the seats are not the best being just wood but once you taste the food all is forgotten"}
{"text":"Great vibe, awesome service and a unique concept for someone who wasnt particularly fond of ramen till kinton happened! I now eat at each of their locations regularly, my only advice would be to be patient because some of their locations get pretty packed."}
{"text":"Great service and excellent ramen. My boyfriend enjoyed his spicy miso ramen. I enjoyed the garden salad and edemame. This place has a nice loud atmosphere and I love all the wood in the interior. The Sapporo is a really good deal to go along with one bowl of ramen. The Okinawa sangria is very good and tastes like lychee juice."}
{"text":"Great place to have a bite after checking out Turner at AGO on New Year's Day.  Takoyaki  and original pork and spicy garlic  ramen.  The original pork ramen had a nice rich broth.  The spicy garlic broth was rather bland.  It might have been better if I ordered the rich vs light broth?  The noodles were perfectly cooked springy firm al dente noodley goodness...  The takoyaki balls were crispy delicious deep fried balls of goodness with bento flakes.  Only wish there was more octopus in them vs the two bits in each one.  Service was friendly although a bit slow but could have been a result of being short staffed on the holiday."}
{"text":"I'm not a big fan of ramen, but my friends wanted to come so I decided to give it a try. I had the vegetarian ramen (of course) and I found it to be really salty. The fried tofu was exceptionally good.  The waiters were all super nice always asking how we're doing and the washrooms were so clean! It even had mouthwash in there! Clean washrooms are the way to my heart. The only downside was that I had to travel downstairs to use it."}
{"text":"Delicious food! Everything was great! Only thing was the ladies sitting next to us possibly ordered the same thing as because we got their appetizers and they got ours. I only noticed when they brought my bf and I pop and we ordered water and the ladies said it was theirs. Aside from the simple mix up the food was great! I enjoyed every bite. The broth was rich with flavor the egg, was not my taste, but it complemented the soup. The turkey was filling and good with the broth. A little dry by itself. Our appetizer was the deep fried potstickers but I ate them so fast before I could take a picture. They were delicious!"}
{"text":"Blah - just average.  I was so stoked when I found out Kinton was opening nearby at Hwy 7 and Valleymede.  We were able to get in during the soft opening, and so excited to try.  However, that was the end of the excitement.  As you can see from the other reviews on here, it is middle of the road.  The downtown location is better - will come back later when the hype dies down to see if they can improve"}
{"text":"Last time I went to this location, it was a horrible experience. As they just opened, i gave them the benefit of the doubt and decided to finally try this location. again.   first off, the service wasn't very good. it was still slow service. We were looking at the people that came in after us, and they received their food before we did. I don't know if the server is just trying to avoid me or whatnot, but it looked like they were giving the table across from us better service. Slow service is usually chalked up to a full house, but this time, it wasn't even full. there was a lot of space everywhere.   Once our order did arrive, it was pretty good. The food was good, and on par with what you would expect from Kinton.....Except for one small detail. Our order wasn't correct. We realized it after we have finished eating. I was looking at another table, and realized that we were missing the egg in our ramen. They had the special ten ten men, and it was supposed to come with an egg. I double checked my picture thinking that I must have eaten it without noticing it, except it wasn't there. Since we finished all the food anyways, there was not point telling our waiter. We just moved on. I don't think we will be repeating this place any time soon."}
{"text":"Visited this location over the week. It was an ok experience. I love skewers, and this location has that option. You would have to ask for their yakitori menu though. If not, you won't be able to order.   Their second floor was reserved, so we ate on the first floor ramen. Overall, it was an OK experience. The service there wasn't very good. Ordered a green tea and an extra bowl that never came.   In terms of their ramen, it isn't fair for me to review as I'm not a fan of the food. I like yakitori better. In terms of the yakitori, the portions were about the same as some of the other locations that I have tried, but it wasn't as good. I found that it wasn't to my liking.   Pros:  Has Yakitori Their Wagu beef yakitori was fantastic The family loved the ramen (don't add the seaweed. The taste overwhelmed one of the soup base in one of the bowls).  Cheese Chicken meatball must eat when hot. then it is good. If the cheese cools, it is terrible.  Cons  Drink and empty bowl didn't arrive Soup base very oily  Shitake mushroom yakitori arrived cold and didn't have any sauce. Tasted really bad Cheese chicken meatball terrible if cools down"}
{"text":"This is a no nonsense, relaxed modern ramen chain of restaurants. The vibe is loud and casual, the menu is a simple \"make-your-own\" bowl (choose your broth, choose your meat, choose noodle style, add toppings). We love it because it's close to work and fairly easy - even if we have our kids with us (we don't have to worry about them being noisy).  The quality is decent, we have found to be inconsistent at times. Possibly a bit pricey for the quality. I have brought a bunch of friends who were new to ramen here and they loved it. More experienced ramen-era seem to find it less attractive.  In terms of food, my number one favourite is the Karaage (not pronounced like garage, FYI) - Japanese fried chicken. There is spicy and non spicy. The hot sauce is SOO good. Tons of umami and flavour in it. Chicken is consistently fried perfectly crunchy outside and juicy inside.  I love the shoyu broth, the noodles are always cooked perfectly (I often get extra noodles) and pork just seems like the right thing when their logo is a pig.  If you are looking for a relaxed bite or to initiate yourself with ramen, this is a good spot!"}
{"text":"I live in the area so this place has become me and my boyfriend's local go-to ramen place! Great energy from the staff - always an enjoyable experience dining here. I do agree the downtown location on Baldwin is a bit better though. They recently introduced combos (ramen and appetizer) which I think it's a a decent deal because those appetizers can definitely add up! I also really enjoyed their homemade lemonade as well!"}
{"text":"This location is much bigger than the ones downtown which is great since there are always lineups downtown. Service was great, flavour of the ramen is good which is enough for me to come back when I'm craving ramen but the only thing for me was the pork. I recall the first time I had Kinton downtown, the pork was super soft and would melt right into your mouth. This time, the pork was a little more chewy and not as soft but other than that I do really like it here."}
{"text":"Kinton Ramen delivers a solid experience in customer service and they have delicious chewy noodles in all of their ramen but one thing I cannot get past is their broth. In every single ramen I've tried from Kinton, all I can feel is that their broth is really, really salty. I tend to prefer a lighter broth for ramen places (the one at Sansotei hits the spot). I tried most of their dishes over the last couple years including their most recent December 2017 special, burnt something ramen. I forget the name. It was disappointingly salty and I could not finish the dish even when I took out the noodles because it soaked up all the salt. I can't even really comment on the flavour because what I mostly think I tasted is well, salt. Am I salty? Hmm idk. I would really like to give a good review for Kinton because they deliver in quality in all other areas: service, atmosphere, noodle chewiness, nicely sliced meats and full eggs are given in the ramen... If only they can work on how much salt goes into their soup."}
{"text":"The interior is very nicely designed. They got a nice appetizer menu and drinks but not more:/  The music in the Baldwin location on Sunday lunch time was way too loud, I really don't understand how the place can't get the fact that people want to talk to each other when they're lunching/dining. Ramen itself is tasteless unfortunately! The spicy garlic ramen is only spice and garlic on top (which you mix in yourself to regulate \"garlicness\"- one good thing about it). The pork one tasted like a hot water with a bit of pork flavour - also there's too much of a noodles inside. I went there a few times as I don't like to base my opinion on the only visit but I won't recommend this place if you like a proper ramen."}
{"text":"Soup base was bland and noodles needed to be cooked longer.  Would still prefer Ajisen Ramen"}
{"text":"I arrived at Kinton Ramen at around 7PM on a Sunday night and it was a full house. The wait times were fair considering they were very busy. It was approximately 10-15 minutes for a table.  I ordered the Vegetarian Ramen (for $10.99) and it was delicious! The broth was the best part for me. Vegetables by themselves are typically quite bland as they take the flavour of what they are cooked it, but the soup made everything very flavourful. There was seaweed, cabbage, broccoli, carrots, bean sprouts and corn, in addition to two tofu nuggets. I would definitely order this again.  I would rate this place a 4/5. The only complaint that I have is that $10.99 is a bit steep when it comes to paying for a veggie dish. Also, the music is a bit too loud for my liking... but that is just personal preference.  Thanks for the meal! :)"}
{"text":"Since I've been to Kinton Ramen so many times before, I wanted to try out a bowl that I hadn't tried before.  I ordered their Spicy Garlic flavour!  Both Christina and I inquired the server about the level of spice in this bowl and we were told that the spice was mild.  I also chose thin noodles, pork ramen broth, and pork belly as the meat.  I don't think I've tried their thick noodles yet still because I'm afraid that thick noodles means that the ramen is too starchy and not as delicious as thin noodles -- I always tend to prefer thin noodles anyway.  Perhaps for my future next visit, I'll finally try their thick noodles!"}
{"text":"My friends and I came here on a Thursday evening. It was busy enough that our group of 3 had to sit at the high stools, but we got seated right away. We were greeted by cosy, modern decor with minimalist furnishings. The square, wooden stools look nice but can get uncomfortable quickly.  I ordered the Pork Original ramen with extra of the thick noodles. The broth was rich and porky as I hoped. The meal came with one piece of leaner piece pork, and one fattier piece. The noodles had a slight chew and spring to them. The taste of the noodles didn't particularly blow me away, but it absorbed enough of the pork flavor in the broth to be satisfying.  The egg was also cooked perfectly, just a little runny, by thick enough that the insides didn't float away.   I also ordered the kimchi on the side. It was not too spicy, and had nice balance of fermented sourness. I enjoyed it.  Our table decided to get one of each dessert. They were all decent, but nothing stood out as amazing. The green tea pudding was topped with hojicha tea which sounds great, but is awkward to try and eat."}
{"text":"I had the pork belly extra pork shout soup with thick noodles in regular broth.  Don't bother ordering extra pork belly - most of it can't be eaten because it's just fats! Regular broth is so salty that you can't even drink the soup. The thick noodles are good with the pork belly. I managed to finished the noodles, but the broth was just way too salty for me.  My boyfriend ordered the chicken with the jalapeno broth. Not worth getting extra chicken because it's so bland. It's like boiled chicken breasts basically.   I like the appetizers. The Aloysius and the fried chicken are really good.  Portions are really good. Reasonably priced, but I felt ripped off getting the extra pork because I couldn't even eat half of it! For $14, it is not worth it!   Service needs improvement. My boyfriend ordered a Coke twice and the server forgot! When we were actually first ordering, we mentioned it to the server but she was just in a rush and didn't get our full order. She just left.    The place is always crowded and there's little place to move around.   Not the best experience so far."}
{"text":"I was excited a new ramen restaurant opened in Markham since ramen is one of my favourite meals. However, my experience and expectations fell short on my visit...   I visited on a Sunday around 730PM and the wait was not as long as I expected (20mins wait) I tried the original pork and it was only OK to me...  The good was the chasui and the noodles. Chasui was tender and flavourful and the noodles were cooked to al dente. The downside was the broth (lacked flavour)  and the overcooked egg (yolk was not runny).  I also order the kakimayo ($4.5/each) - baked oyster with cheese and mushrooms. Cheesy and creamy, I enjoyed the flavour of this dish a lot   Overall it is good, I like how they have more tapas selections. I would probably try the other broths or order additional toppings to make it more flavourful. Decent service."}
{"text":"Love this place! I always order Jalapeño base with extra chicken, corn, bean sprouts and thin noodles. Sunday to Thursday they also have a special $10 for a 60 oz pitcher of Sapporo. Check it out - you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Kinton Ramen 7 is located at the Commerce Gate plaza, a small plaza that already is home to many other delicious eateries and shops.  The KINKA Original Ramune drink was so fun since you had to open it by popping the cork into the bottle for the marble to drop.  It was a sweet soda drink.   I have had the Kakimayo (baked oyster with spinach, mushrooms, and garlic mayo, topped with cheese) before and this remains one of my favorite tapas to order.  The spinach sauce with the cheese was to die for!  The Tofu Furai is one of the best tasting appetizers to go with your ramen.  I discovered it on my first visit to Kinton Ramen back at their original location and have always raved about these tofu nuggets since.  They are slightly crispy on the outside with a really smooth vegetarian-friendly interior that tastes almost like chicken nuggets but better.  You just have to try it out yourself to see what it's like!  Their Tako Wasabi (marinated octopus with wasabi stem) remains one of the best I've ever had.  It was perfectly marinated with spicy wasabi stem that really sent a spice to our nostrils!  It was so good!  I remember I really enjoyed the Hot Karaage at another location of Kinton Ramen when I visited back in the summer and loved the spicy fried chicken.  Gomaae (blanched spinach with black sesame sauce) is another favourite tapa of mine.  It was such a simple dish but so tasty thanks to the slightly sweet black sesame sauce.  This was my first time trying the Salmon Natto Yukke (chopped salmon sashimi with seven friends -- natto, okra, kimchi, scallion, wonton skin, garlic chips, and raw egg yolk) and I was very curious about it when I saw it on the menu.  After the server set it on the table (and I took some quick photos), she helped us to mash everything up together.  There were some nori available on the side of the plate to serve everything together.  I thought that this was such a unique blend of different textures and flavours.  It wasn't common to see natto served together with other ingredients as I had only eaten it raw as breakfast in Japan before.  We enjoyed this dish but thought that it could have benefited with a vinegar or soy sauce like ingredient to bring up the taste.  The Ebi Mayo (deep fried prawn with spicy mayo) was pretty good.  The prawns were very fresh and firm.  On this visit, I tried a Vegetarian Ramen for the first time!  It contained a bowl of thick ramen with seasoned vegetables with tofu furai in a 100% vegetarian broth.  It was definitely a very clean tasting broth and there were many vegetables in it too!  K ordered the Chicken Shoyu Ramen.  The chicken breast meat was just as firm and tender as I remembered from one of my previous visits and the chicken stock was so rich!  The Virgin Ramune Mojito had ramune, lime, and mint in it.  This was actually just the bottle of KINKA Original Ramune arrived with a glass with lime and mint in it.  It helped to break up the sweetness from the original ramune bottle.  The Matcha Cheesecake (baked matcha green tea cheesecake).  It was very smooth and creamy!  The matcha taste was very much present as well.  We both really enjoyed theBlack Sesame Soymilk Pudding with whipped cream.  It was extremely smooth and tasted of black sesame!  It was also melt-in-your-mouth softness.  This was a perfect portion to share as it would be a lot for one person to finish on their own."}
{"text":"I'd give this 3.5 stars. The ramen is pretty good but the service is subpar. Not to say that they are rude, because the servers seem nice, but it seems they have a hard time dealing with more than a few people at a time. This was the case for both times I was here and the second time it was not busy."}
{"text":"I was pretty excited to try out Kinton Ramen. I've heard a lot of good things about the place, so when I was deciding where to meet up for dinner with a friend, I immediately picked Kinton.  The decor of the place was very modern and stylish, making it a good place to a quick meet up with friends. However, I wouldn't recommend it as a place for catching up as the service is pretty fast and the restaurant has a pretty high turnover, making it difficult for you to stay for long.  I enjoyed the Spicy Garlic Ramen I ordered. I normally don't find Japanese spicy ramen soup spicy, but I could actually taste the spiciness! I ordered the thick noodles and fully enjoyed the texture of the noodles.   Overall, I enjoyed my time at Kinton Ramen. However I still can't decide whether it's better than my favorite ramen place in Toronto- Ramen Isshin."}
{"text":"Ramen is my type of comfort food and I frequent Kinton all the time.  I'd say the quality isn't consistent across their chain stores.  In addition, I dislike that the broth came warm (instead of steaming hot) when they arrived at our table.  Service is standard, nothing stand out but nothing bad either.  For the price, I won't go very often but still do when I need my ramen fix"}
{"text":"Me and my brother go to this location about once a month and it never seems to disappoint. The service is friendly and efficient, and the food is amazing. I recommend the original ramen with an extra serving of pork belly. The kaarage is also very good."}
{"text":"Super resto rapide et savoureux avec de très bonnes options végé! Le personnel est très sympathique. Le menu est simple... des soupes ramen!!!! Aux bouillon de porc, au poulet ou la meilleure au bouillon de légume dans la version végétarienne. Les nouilles étaient parfaites. On peut pimper la soupe de légumes pour un léger extra.   Une erreur de traduction qui embête les serveurs/euses: le terme 'seasonned vegetable' est traduit 'légumes assaisonnés' plutôt que 'légumes de saison'. Imaginez l'ambiguité et les questions qui viennent avec ;)  Sake chaud et bière Sapporo sont disponibles.  Le gâteau au fromage au thé Matcha est massif et abordable (3.50$) pour sa dimension.   Il y a de la place pour une tablé de 2 à 10 personnes. J'ai beaucoup aimé et je vais revenir souvent :)"}
{"text":"I've tried Kinton ramen several times and I've never been a fan until the last time I came. I decided to give this place another try after seeing the reviews on their gyoza and how great people said the sauce on it was. This place happened to be on my way home from work and because I was super hungry, I decided to eat here. I ordered the ramen combo with the spicy garlic ramen paired with 4pcs of gyoza. Although their ramen was good, the broth was a bit too salty for my liking and it wasn't amazing compared to sansotei. I am giving this place 4 stars because the gyoza was one of the best ones if not the best gyoza I've ever tried. Not sure what they put in that sauce but it definitely was super amazing!"}
{"text":"I don't usually love ramen. But kinton's so far is the best I've had in the city.   -Noodles are cooked just right  -Broth is flavorful but not salty -The egg could be a bit more runny, but still was ok -Pork is tender   I also order a rice dish. That is nothing special. I would skip this unless you really want rice.   The shrimp in their ebi mayo was a bit smaller than some other places.   I hope they do well in this location. Uptown is missing a good ramen place."}
{"text":"One of my go-to ramen places in Toronto. Conveniently located outside the U of T St. George campus, it's a great spot for students to grab a bite between/after classes.   The store is small and the seating is the typical long counters with high chairs. I'd prefer not sitting next to strangers but it's not bad enough that I'd remove stars for the way their store is set up.   Prices are reasonable, basically the same as any other ramen place in the GTA. The ramen itself is pretty awesome; portions are big and very delectable - different options for soup bases, noodle types, etc.  Definitely would recommend this to anyone (U of T kids I'm looking at you) who's looking for some blessed ramen at an affordable price (that's near campus too)."}
{"text":"Compared to ramen places in NYC, this place can pretty much hold its own!  So I got the rich, miso, pork shoulder ramen and it paled in comparison to my bf's special chicken stock ramen. It was a special of the day with only 30 available. The broth in his soup was absolutely amazing. My broth, on the other hand, was just mediocre. If anyone else knows a better combo for their regular ramen, let me know!   My ramen was a part of a lunch special that included the ramen, a side order or rice with shredded chicken, and a drink. I thought it was a pretty good deal. The side order is very small, and I was disappointed they didn't use Japanese rice...just regular Jasmine I think? I got the fruit tea which was a nice and unique resfreshment!  I especially recommend the fried chicken (karaage). If the wait's not too long the next time i'm here, I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Upon entering the staff greeted us with a hearty irasshaimase.  Nice touch.  This is a chain from Toronto which we thought we would try.  We tried the pork original with double noodles and chicken miso.  The pork original was definitely better. The fatty side pork slice was melt in your mouth, broth creamy tasty although the a little salty for me.   The seasoned egg was cooked nicely, but too salty.  The ramen noodle had a good texture even at the bottom of the bowl.   The chicken miso soup was really nice, but I thought the meat tasted a little strange like it had been in the fridge too long.   We also tried the takoyaki which was pretty standard.  The serving was only four pieces vs six at other restaurants.  The balls were bigger and had two pieces of tako.  Prices were pretty standard for ramen in Montreal which is not too cheap.    Verdict?  I'm still looking for good Montreal Ramen.  It's not bad here, but certainly not up to international standards."}
{"text":"Good food. Disorganized service. Restaurant is still new.. lots of empty tables but servers are not able to clear them fast enough for seats.. lots of people waiting. Long wait for food as well. Kinton on church is still my favourite Kinton!"}
{"text":"I've been to Kinton a few times, and I always opt for the Chicken miso combo with the Chiki chiki don. The chiki chiki don is a chicken don(chicken with rice) appetizer and it honestly tastes amazing. the mixture of the mayo with the soy sauce goes is surprisingly perfect Now for the ramen. It came with two small pieces of chicken, which I think is pretty cheap, and the only other toppings on it are seaweed and chives. The soup was honestly way to creamy for my taste, and I thought it needed a touch of salt. The noodles were perfectly cooked though, a little bit springy and chewy, just how I like them.  No complaints about the service."}
{"text":"Went with kids to see if any seats were available. There were seats available. Even thought my kids are 9 and 11 years old and have eaten there with high seats before and definitely tall enough to eat there, we were told that we only allowed to eat at lower table. They only have one lower table and that was taken. We eat Ramen in Japan all the time. And kids eat with high chair here never been refused. So we went to RYUS which is on the same street. We ate at the table with high chair. ( RYUS soup and noodle are better but many were waiting at RYUS that we only went to Kinton to see if any seats available anyway. ) Kinton here is NOT very child friendly place! NOT to go with kids!!!! Just go RYUS !!"}
{"text":"This place is always packed. After dining here twice I can see why. This place has my vote for the best ramen in GTA.   I like how they let you customize your broth/noodles/portions/toppings in a simple to navigate menu. There are 2 things that stood out for me. One is the pork broth. The \"rich\" version is the tastiest ramen broth I've ever had. I think even better than what I had in Japan. The second thing is how they flame grill the pork belly. Their pork belly pieces are large and very fatty and tender.   Another victory point for having a stamp card system. You only get a stamp if you finish a bowl to the last drop. This makes it kind of \"fun\" to eat here and it's a very Japanese thing to do.  They also win my vote for the most energetic staff. The guys in the kitchen have spider senses and will shout something in Japanese to welcome you when you enter. They do it more energetically than other places.   I'll be a regular customer."}
{"text":"Had the cravings for ramen and decided to give Kinton a try. We got a bit lucky and got seated right away. The place is not so big, so there's usually a small line and wait time.  The ramen menu is quite simple and allow you to select soup base, flavour, noodle, and protein. I got the spicy garlic ramen with pork and thin noodles. My wife got the spicy jalapeño ramen with chicken and thin noodles. The wait for the food was quite long compared to other ramen places, or maybe we were unlucky and the kitchen was really busy serving up orders. Also, they did make a mistake and gave my wife the pork instead of the chicken she ordered. But anyways...  The soup base and flavouring was quite strong, and you can distinctively taste the jalapeño or garlic flavours, which was nice. One thing to note is that Kinton does not seem to serve egg by default with their ramen, meaning you need to pay extra for it, unlike most other ramen places. The portion sizes are quite small and the two slices of pork were small and thin.  I think it is worth trying Kinton once, but probably not a frequent place to visit due to the line ups, pricing, and size of their food."}
{"text":"Great place for Ramen and fast service. Pretty good prices too. Would recommend."}
{"text":"Not a bad place to go for ramen. Located on Church and Gerrard st. Very good location"}
{"text":"This is a smaller version of Guu that just serves ramen. Entering with that in mind, you're going to be very happy with your experience here.   As is a growing fad (one I'm a fan of) everyone shouts a welcome at you, you're promptly shown to your seats by very friendly staff who are all Japanese. There are tables on either end of the restaurant that can accommodate medium sized groups of around 7 and the kitchen which occupies most of the narrow interior is lined with tall wooden stools so this is not too bad a spot to dine alone while watching your food being prepared right in front of you. And for around $10 you can enjoy a well made Ramen, I opted for the Shoyu ramen with regular soup and pork shoulder since I'm not a fan of overly fatty cuts of meat. The quantity was perhaps on par with most ramen I've had in Toronto and service was very quick.  It's got such a clean look and coming from the west on Baldwin this is the first restaurant you hit and it looks great from outside with large windows just begging you to take a look inside. It's set up so you and quickly set up with a seat and go ahead with your experience, their menu is appreciatively sized on the smaller scale with 2 variations (type of soup and meat) with the ability to add on other ingredients such as egg. Speaking of egg, I loved the egg that came with my soup, hard boiled but with an ever so slightly runny yolk.  A stellar addition to Baldwin Village and it definitely stands out proclaiming passers by to give it a go!"}
{"text":"Kinton is the newest ramen shop to hit Toronto with many more on the way this summer.  Although much press has associated it with the franchise Guu, it should be noted that this is a separate business altogether.  The connection is that Toronto's Guu franchisee happens to be the owner of Kinton as well.  After a one hour and fifteen minute wait, our table of six finally got seated.  The restaurant itself is long and narrow, with rather anti-social seating save for the standing-room only table up front, and communal table in the back.   Otherwise, it is bar seating only.  It is definitely not a place I would recommend for a crowd as it doesn't exactly allow for conversation.  Kinton is Japanese for gold pig, as witnessed by the many that adorn the walls as decoration.  It no doubt also refers to the pork that is used to make the soup base for the ramen.  In addition to ramen, there is a short list of appetizers.  They don't have their liquor license yet, but be sure to order Calpico ($3.00), a creamy, citrusy and yogurty beverage made from nonfat milk -  it's no Pina Colada, but it's still pretty good.  Tonight, our group opted for to start with a few appetizers.  The Spicy Karaage ($4.80), which is basically fried chicken was sweet and spicy with a light batter.  It's always a must-order item whenever I'm at a Japanese izakaya.  I like the fact that you can choose from regular or spicy.  The Gyoza ($3.50), which are dumplings was not impressive.  The filling was scant and not very savory.  The Tofufurai ($4.80), which are tofu \"nuggets\" were the highlight of our appetizers for me.  Resembling McNuggets, Kinton managed to take a rather tasteless and bland tofu and make it very yummy.  If you closed your eyes, you could just be fooled into thinking you were eating actual chicken.  This was drizzled with a citrus-mayo sauce.  Sadly, the ramen was the most disappointing part of the evening for me.  I ordered the Cheese Ramen ($10.80) with a choice of either pork belly or shoulder.  I of course opted for the belly.  You also get to choose from a light or regular broth.  I opted for regular.  This is topped with shredded Swiss cheese.   While the pork belly was quite tender and flavourful, you had to eat it sparingly as you get one scant strip of it.  I should've opted for some extra pork, but instead I opted for an egg.  The egg was perfectly soft boiled with a runny yolk and for me, was the best part.  The soup broth was not hot enough to melt the cheese, and it became one large, rubbery clump.  The soup base was creamy, but lacked any real pork flavour for me and even had a slight bitter aftertaste to it.  The bean sprouts are extremely fresh, and the noodles were cooked al dente.  You get a heaping bowl of noodles and not much of anything else (if a carb overload is what you're looking for).   V E R D I C T  It's unfortunate that tonight's dinner couldn't end on a sweet note with the lack of a dessert menu.  The ramen, which is their signature product did not impress me as the ratio of ingredients was disproportionate.  I couldn't help but think that I could've dumped in a pack of instant ramen at home for my carb fix.  The soup base also failed to impress, and that is a pretty important part of a good ramen. While I enjoyed the ambiance and service was excellent, the food fell short of my expectations.  P.S.  Kinton, it wouldn't hurt to have purse hooks at your bar seats, because we ladies don't like putting fancy purses on the floor ;)"}
{"text":"Staffs are friendly. Good deal on pre-set menu."}
{"text":"Not sure why this place is hyped so much, maybe because it's relatively new and because of its presence on social media. I've been 3 times mostly because my friends felt like it and because it is in a convenient location.   This restaurant is pretty much similar to any other average ramen place in Montreal. The only cool things are their terrasse and their spicy choices, although I tried it once and don't feel like trying it again. They just don't bring out as good as a spicy feeling that I have with all other spicy food, because it's not spicy enough and have a thick feeling to the broth. I've had the spicy pork ramen and the original pork ramen. The pork pieces are pretty big, and the eggs are cooked just right, but that's about all that's somewhat special. I have tried my friend's cold ramen, and the broth tasted so awful that I would not want to have a more. It was kind of sour but not in a good way.   I'm giving it a 4 but it's more of a 3.5. I'll round it up for the cute IG pictures that are always fun to take."}
{"text":"Kinto is owned by the owners of Guu. Kinton's noodles are good. I would not say it is my favourite ramen spot, but the restaurant's ace card is its massively flavourful broth.   The atmosphere is lively and modern. The service is quick and efficient. Kinton is a great place to go if you are craving a warm bowl of ramen."}
{"text":"If you are looking for amazing Ramen and a good time, come to this place. The atmosphere is fun and loud as the staff welcome us into the restaurant. As we sat down, our server was friendly and quick. I ordered the org I already pork ramen with extra corn and seaweed."}
{"text":"This was my first experience with \"fancy ramen\", and I was very pleased! I would definitely go back.  We split the Gyoza appetizer to start, and they were delicious. These were fried and crispy on the outside, with juicy filling. I had the pork broth shoyu ramen, thick noodles, add seasoned egg. It was rich and flavorful. The pork was tender. The bean sprouts on top were the perfect little bit of crunch against the soft noodles. My boyfriend had the pork broth spicy garlic ramen, with thin noodles. He's been in to Kinton many times and has never been disappointed. Although he didn't do it his time, he recommends trying the Swiss cheese add-on at least once because it adds a whole new level of taste and texture.  This location was clean, the staff were friendly and efficient, and the washrooms were tidy. A+!"}
{"text":"Pros: Reasonable for portion size, friendly staff, quick service, fun to watch chef cook, rewarded me with a \"Kinton Ramen\" card where once enough full bowls of ramen are consumed, it can be redeemed for awards.  Cons: Gyoza were nothing to write home about, same could be said about my friend's takoyaki.   Verdict: Would recommend."}
{"text":"If you're in love with Garlic, you will LOVE their spicy garlic ramen.  We've all been there, cheaping out on meals by cooking a $2 ramen pack from our local convenience store. Kinton Ramen makes you regret each of those times.  Kinton is not only super authentic, but it's reasonably priced, always filled with people, and extremely quick to serve.   The Baldwin location is particularly cute. Where it lacks in group seating, Kinton makes up for in flavor - definitely check this place out if you're desperate to leave those $2 packs of ramen behind."}
{"text":"Just a short walk from the North York Centre subway station this is the only Kinton outside of downtown (so far...). I've been to the one on Queen and also the one on Baldwin previously and I think this is the smallest of the three.   In terms of design it's the same as the others. Maybe because it's smaller or the staff are just livelier but there's serenity more of an electric feeling here than he other two locations that I've been too.   The food at Kinton is always spot on and his location is no different. On a cold day and craving hot soup Kinton is the way to go. Can't go wrong with Extra Pork Shoyu Thick Noodles with Pork Belly."}
{"text":"A friend of my highly recommended this place so I had to give it try. Waited about 20 mins on a Friday night, which was fine. Waiter and host were both friendly.   The food was okay. The spicy garlic ramen looked special so my husband ordered that. It has a strong garlic taste, but besides that it really isn't that special. Alert: DO NO ORDER THIS IF YOU ARE ON A DATE!  I could smell the garlic on my hubby the whole night after dinner even after tons of mints, and as you can imagine, it was not pleasant/romantic at all!   I had the cheese ramen, and that was lackluster too. I was expecting more of it, while it turned out to be pretty straightforward: cheese, and ramen. The mix of the two didn't bring too much synergies of fancy flavors. Another note, I am very not sure it was because the soup was a bit greasy than normal ramen, or because it had a larger portion (which i don't think so), for the first time both my husband and I didn't finish the entire bowl.   Definitely does not stand out among the many ramen places in Toronto."}
{"text":"Best chicken miso ramen!! Awesome service!  Very friendly :) loved the spicy pork ramen"}
{"text":"A little more hyped up than I thought, but it was pretty good.    Loved the atmosphere.  Something about chefs shouting, singing, and having fun, makes it really enjoyable to eat their food lol.  They're also pretty talented at this ramen art science magic thing.  Amazing!  Food was all over the chart, but I think it really depends on what you order.    1. Had the original karaage, which was amazing!  Loved it.  Think I'll get spicy next time.  2. Had the Shoyu Ramen -- regular \"richness\" (should've got rich I think), and with pork belly (think I should've gotten the shoulder since 60% is pure fat lol).  Great soup, tasty pork, great ramen, and a really delish boiled egg, which was still yolky!  3. Had the Cheese Ramen - disgusting actually.  Awkward taste - I don't think the miso flavoured soup, the cheese (mozzerella), and corn, mix well AT ALL.  Looked pretty crazy good on the menu (since I love cheese on everything), but was mad disappointing.    4. Sapporo.  Chilled mug - awesome awesome.  Since the place is rather hot, a Sapporo is a must have.  Experience was fantastic, except it was really spoiled by the cheese ramen.  I also think I've had better tonkotsu ramen elsewhere in Toronto, but still a great place in a great street full of awesome food."}
{"text":"First time here came in super hungry upon arrival.  Customer service was quick!  Recommend the pork shoulder with ramen noodles it was delicious.  I loved sitting at the bar watching food and presentation being prepped.  Will come back again the next time I visit."}
{"text":"I was starving when I arrived went there after dropping stuff off at the hotel.  The menu was simple the waiter was helpful as I have never been there before.  My ramen arrived promptly it was delicious."}
{"text":"Love this place and the service. They never disappoint. Ramen is top notch, perfect for the winter."}
{"text":"With 6 Kinton Ramen locations, 5 in Toronto and 1 in Quebec, I went to Kinton Ramen 4! Assuming that this was the 4th location they opened in Ontario, hence all the numbers behind each name.  The Kinka Family also owns JaBistro, Kinka Izakaya & Neo Coffee Bar besides their several Kinton Ramen stores! They have established pretty well over the years here in Toronto !  The weather in Toronto has been freezing lately, so what's better than a bowl of yummy ramen to warm me up?  Kinton Ramen 4 has a pretty tight spacing, with about 4 tables for 2-3 seaters, and about 2 big tables for groups, and a huge bar seating - where you can see the the chefs make the ramen and so systematic too!  At Kinton Ramen, they have pork ramen and chicken ramen - and you can get meal combos as well!  I went for a Miso Pork Ramen with thin noodles! :) My Miso flavoured ramen came with soybean paste, bean sprouts, scallions, corn, garlic oil with pork broth.  Kinton Ramen also allows slight customization such as noodle thickness (thick or thin), additional toppings at an extra price (sweet corn, butter, nori, scallions, seasoned egg, etc). Personally, I really like thin noodles because of the firmness of the noodles. So I can slurp and bite it easier as well. Thick noodles doesn't have that texture that I like in ramen noodles.  In hindsight, I should have attempted the Kinton Bowler, in which you finish the entire bowl (including the broth)! Kinton Ramen has certain incentives when you do, which you can read more on their website :)  I have been to Kinton Ramen before a few years ago and I remember the broth being very very salty. This time around though, it wasn't as salty as I've remembered! It was better and more enjoyable this round, but I didn't finish it again, because I was full at the end of my meal, haha.  With so many ramen places around Toronto, it's easy to get your ramen craves fixed! Especially with the cold weathers coming in, I would rather have warm soupy meals instead."}
{"text":"This place is easily one of my favorite restaurants in Montreal. And should hands down be 5 stars. I have been a loyal customer ever since it opened and working on my way as a kinton bowler. I've tried the miso which was good but absolutely in love with the porc classic.. first of all, they cook the egg just right, after all the times I've been there I have never been disappointed on the egg. The broth is to die for and the noodles are just so good!! The gyoza and tofu furai(tofu nuggets) is out of this world and I always order these appetizers when I go.  I love the staff, I always have such quick and welcoming service here.   I would recommend this place for anyone crazy for ramen. My onto wish is for tonkotsu soup to be added to the menu."}
{"text":"Ahh.. The satisfaction of a perfect bowl of ramen noodles is hard to top. I had the October special, which was a Tonkotsu shoyu ramen, which comes with half a soft boiled egg and spinach.   Every component from the salinity and richness of the broth, the tender slices of lean and fatty chashu, the thick chewy noodles that soak up the broth, to the soft boiled egg was divine. Extra points for the generous portion of boiled spinach to balance put the richness.   My side of Age (a.k.a. fried) Gyoza was crispy and tasty, too. The creamy sweet chilli sauce was perfect for it. I was sad that there were only four small pieces!"}
{"text":"????????????????????????????? ???? ??????????????????  ?????????????????????????????? ???????????????. ????????????????? ????kinton??????church?? ??????????"}
{"text":"Good quality ramen in a good atmosphere. Had the sea salt broth, with thick noodles and pork belly. I choose the thick broth that consisted of a clear broth with visible bits of pork fat. Personally I would of perfered a thick emulsified base more. The noodles were well cooked and had a good texture. The egg was sweet and had semi-solid yolk on the inside.  On the side I had the Hot Kaarage i.e. the spicy fried chicken. I was hoping for a dry rub spices on a crispy chicken or mb a tasty chicken marinated in spicy sauce. However their hot Kaarage consisted of a tasty well marinated chicken covered in a from mildy spicy sauce that trenched the chicken. It was still tasty but the crispiness of the chicken is lost in all that sauce. I would get the regular Kaarage and forgo the spicy sauce next time."}
{"text":"Last night was Kinton Ramen's Mega Ramen Challenge!! We went there around 19h30 - the place was packed and animated (there was even a challenger dressed as Dragonball's Son Goku!) There was was short line-up, but we only waited about 10 mins to get a table.  I was initally worried that the service would be slow because of the ongoing Challenge, but the Kinton team was fast and efficient. We gave our orders within 10 minutes, and received our food soon after. We got the original chicken and the original pork ramen, the Chiki Chiki Don, and homemade ice tea. They had quite a selection of toppings, so we decided to try cheese (lol). The Don came first, and was surprisingly good! The mayo really complemented the seaweed topping, and the sweetened soy sauce at the bottom was perfect for the rice. The ramen came pipping hot. The broths were quite good, but a bit more oily than that of other places, and - q u i t e - salty. I usually drink some of the broth after finishing the noodles, but couldn't do it this time. The pork and chicken slices were tender and delicious, and the noodles were nice and chewy. Surprisingly, melting the cheese in ramen was quite good... The portion wasn't very large, but not smaller than that of Yokato Yokabai or Schlouppe Bistrot Nakamichi. Unfortunately, we received our ice tea last, when we had already finished eating.  I would recommend for them to get more coat racks, especially since winter is upon us. Not everyone will appreciate having to hold their big coats on their lap, sitting on those tiny stools. It was overall a very entertaining experience. The Mega Ramen Challenge was so much fun - I might try next time (and probably bring home tons of leftovers)!!"}
{"text":"Another Kinton Ramen opened up just a block away from my home. Great location but expect long lineups since it's right on Yonge Street.  Ordered the Miso Ramen with pork shoulder. It was full of flavour and the pork was very tender. We also tried the tofu nuggets which was surprisingly good.   Service was friendly and pretty efficient.   I would give this location 5 stars but the original Baldwin location is better due to better ambience.  I'd recommend coming here just after 1pm for lunch and before 6pm to avoid the long wait time."}
{"text":"This is by far the best ramen place that i've been to!!! I have tried a few other ramen places in Toronto but Kinton offers the best soup broth and is consistent everytime.  My favourite is the Shoyu Ramen offering a soy based flavour. The pork belly melts in your mouth and the noodles have a great texture.  The restaurant is fairly small as you'll find bar top tables so expect there will be a lineup during the lunch hours....but...it's worth the wait!  You'll find a friendly and welcoming atmosphere and if you sit at the bar in front of the kitchen, you can see the chefs prep the food."}
{"text":"This place is always a hit or miss for me. Last time I waited around 43 mins for my food when I was on a tight schedule. They most likely forgot our order ...  This time was a good experience, we both got their Rich Tonkotsu Shoyu Ramen (October special) and it was pretty good. I was hesitant at first since I only like some of their ramen but I tried it anyways. $12.99 is pricey but it's okay since I normally get the 3x chatsu ramen which is like $15 something. I will be coming back, always."}
{"text":"I'm not sure about the other locations but Kinton at this location was pretty bad. It was just salty noodle. I ordered garlic oil miso ramem. What I had taste could only be described as chewy overly salted noodles. Not a hint of miso or garlic flavour . Oh and the egg lacked flavour, it was plain with light soya flavour. This location also cost 1 $ or $2 more than the other locations. Based on the other review, I paid more to get low quality ramen.   Guess you don't know till you try right ? Never again."}
{"text":"I love that the menu is customizable (different broth, noodles,spices) with tons of cheap extras. I felt more in control of what was in my bowl.   I ordered the thin noodle, extra seaweed and sweet corn, chicken broth original and it was delicious! (There isn't much difference between thick and thin noodle) The sizes are ginormous so I think it's unnecessary to order an appetizer/dessert.  The broth was really excellent, tasted really comforting and filling. The extra seaweed and sweet didn't do much to heighten my enjoyment of the meal so I probably wouldn't get them again. The Egg that they put inside was ok but the taste was overshadowed by everything else going on so I can't really say if I enjoyed it.  The only thing that bothered me was the seating. They have these tiny wooden stools that are very uncomfortable and all the tables are close so there's nowhere to put your bag without it getting in the way of someone.  The restaurant has a real 'busy' feel. The employees are running around and they chant some directions to make sure everyone is aware of what they were doing. It wasn't that distracting but it might not be the best place for a nice quiet meal.   Overall, I would go back but maybe just to take out."}
{"text":"After all the ramen places that opened, Kinton was never really my go to ramen places.   However, this location is more spacious, and I find the texture of the noodle nicer compared to the other locations. One important point to note is that the pork can be warmer.  I really enjoyed the Bamboo cocktail, the flavour was nice and it was refreshing."}
{"text":"Crazy awesome good - get the egg in the chicken ramen with thin noodle - also had fried pork dumplings!  Kimchi with spicy garlic pork soup for those with fiery taste buds - definitely coming back here every time we come to Toronto!  Not a drop left!   Homemade lemonade awesome too - keep adding ice water - still good!"}
{"text":"I think Kinton's ramen is mediocre although some of my friends go there all the time. I love their momo cocktail :)"}
{"text":"Infamous for ramen. Always crowded.  we came here after a fun night of improv. We recieved a warm welcome as we entered the place. I ordered a veggie noodles (picture below). Its super delicious. Bowl was full of noodles and veggies. They also serve cold noodles salad here. Their dessert is made from soy. I will try them next time  Place is clean and spacious. Good for groups. Great service."}
{"text":"Came here with my friend, the main choices for ramen are chicken or pork. The veggie option is \"ramen salad\". Its basically cold ramen with lettuce and corn on top. OK so its not what I was expecting but it was very tasty and filling. Surely worth a try."}
{"text":"It all depends on your taste buds. Some prefer other ramen houses, but I don't mind this chain (given the limited selection of really good places in Toronto).   As usual, I'm a little discouraged due to the cost of a single serving of noodles. More of an issue is that one cannot add more noodles to an existing bowl of remaining broth. Thus, encouraging you to order another full meal should the extra noodles placed with the original order isn't enough to fill you."}
{"text":"Probably my new favourite ramen place to go to now. I ordered the original pork soup base. The soup wasn't too salty and the pork flavour was rich and tasty. The egg yolk had a really nice consistency, and the egg white was great in flavour. The meat tasted torched(?) and tasted wonderful. Will definitely recommend to friends."}
{"text":"Hands down best ramen I've had. Now Montreal doesn't really have good ramen, so when my boyfriend took me here, I was blown away by the quality of the noodles and the pork belly as well as shoyu broth.  The pork belly was nice and fatty, the broth was excellent and flavorful, the egg was tasty, and the texture of the thick noodles was just right. Service was attentive and I really had no complaints about this place. One thing I'd like to add is, they have REALLY nice bathrooms! Not that it is important, but hey it's a bonus?  The design/atmosphere of the restaurant is very modern, sleek, and clean. I really enjoyed my experience here. Really recommend visiting this place if in Toronto area and love ramen! (especially if you are a Montrealer, because truth be told, we have really below average to mediocre ramen in the city)"}
{"text":"The ramen here was absolutely delightful.  I got the extra pork original ramen with chicken breast.  The noodles were tender and the amount of meat was decent.  The soup base was wonderful.  I'll preface my review by saying this - I'm an American from New York City.  I've only had ramen twice before this from NYC.  This place really beats the two places I've been to for ramen including Ippudo - but that's just my take on it."}
{"text":"I know it's weird to have a \"favourite Kinton Ramen\" but this is definitely my favourite Kinton Ramen. I've brought other friends here and they've agreed that there is definitely a difference between the food here and the food at other locations."}
{"text":"Great ramen place, close enough to downtown Montreal. Broth was thick, but I think it needed a bit more salt for a spicy tonkotsu, but spice was just right. Noodles were good, but I would say the chashu needed a bit more care. It was a bit limp...  The ambience was fun. You are greeted with the standard cheer from a ramen staff, then seated promptly. The decor is nice and minimalist.  I highly recommend! 5-stars for a Montreal based joint."}
{"text":"Go-to Ramen place! Friendly staff, great ambiance and pretty good food. The egg is a must when ordering ramen toppings. Trust me on this one."}
{"text":"I would rate it as all right :) I usually like to order a bowl of spicy pork ramen with a side of karaage chicken when I try out a ramen place. The broth itself was in fact spicy but didn't have that much flavour but I was impressed with pork, portion was great, a little of fat and seasoned ! The noddles themselves were thick and perfect size. The karaage chicken was however disappointing, it was dry and basically fried chicken without much seasoning and there was nothing special about the sauce..."}
{"text":"I feel like their ramen is overly salty - the flavour is very good but I'm left super thirsty for water after. Its definitely good ramen but not the best in Toronto IMO."}
{"text":"Edit: After seeing so many of these reviews, just want to say that this is NOT a family style place! Don't bring all you kids and expect to be seated comfrotably in a large group greater than 3-4 people! This is a Ramen BAR. it's not a restaurant. You are better off going to Kenzo for a more spacious experience.  I feel like people are constantly complaining about the space, but aside from the lack of ventilation, it's not meant for you to sit long, and chitchat and have a birthday party.   The only problem is that the service is lacking when I was there, and they need to keep up with the turnover. Come at lunch time, for your best seating. ---------- Review: Its okay. If it wasnt for the longgg line up due to the hype, it would have been better, but thank godness it was a nice day and it didnt matter too much.  Saturday afternoon it was about a 30min wait.  Make sure you put your name down and hang around the area because they will call you name a few times before you table is given away.  The long narrow bar like interior goesnt have a lot of seating and makes for a not very ventalited experience. Its hot in there !   The menu is tasty but very catered to meat/pork eaters. If you dont eat pig, there not much choice other than the Vegetarian Ramen (but be warned it made from Pork Bone Soup) and two Dons (rice, both non vegetarian, unless you eat Salmon roe).  Otherwise, go all out on the pork ramen! Choose from different flavours of soup (miso, spicy garlic, soy sauce and plain, $9-10). You can choose from pork shoulder or pork belly. The pork is marinated all special and cooked with a blow torch.   You can also add another $2 for more pork, or order a big bowl of noodles for $12.8, but I think its cheaper to get regular size and add $2.  Although we ordered the big one and we ordered shoulder and belly, they only gave us belly.  It was think, but tasty. Yes the broth makes a difference, and it was really tasty, but not sure if I'll be back.  For appetizers, we got the chicken karaage (spicy, yum) and kimchi ($3, not worth it, you can get this small portion next door just for sitting down)  Now, sitting 3 engineers at the bar watching the kitchen with slow service we saw so many problems. There's an appetizer guy, noodles guy, pork guy and the assembly/soup guy.    Many times the basket that they cook noodles in were empty many of the time. The main chef seemed to be confused a lot of the time exactly what they were putting together.  The pork guy seemed to need more space and hard time keeping up (work balance req'd!). At times their roles were jumbled and it was confusing.  Hopefully they will improve on their service and get more people thru the door! But I wouldn't come here with a party of more than 4."}
{"text":"Kinton has become my favourite place to go for ramen (only been to Sansotei & Kenzo). What I like:  - Their pork spicy garlic is always available! At Sansotei, their spicy tan tan is limited quantity - They have more choice and pictures on their menu which definitely helps those who are trying ramen for the first time - Great service always - Easy access to this location from the west end  What I don't like: - Their spoons are too big for me and difficult to use, but not a deal breaker at all  I hope they expand further west of Toronto!"}
{"text":"I have been to quite a few Ramen spots after I discovered the wonderful world of Ramen 3 years ago... Kinton is by far my favorite.  I love their spiced egg... I could eat so many of these... and the pork belly... and the chicken... and garlic. Omg. So good.  The seating is a little limited and uncomfortable. However, in my opinion worth it."}
{"text":"This is by far my favourite ramen place. It is a popular restaurant so if you plan to go for dinner be prepared to wait approx 30-40mins, but it's definitely worth it!! The flavours and quality of the soup, protein and noodles were amazing. It wasn't too heavy or too salty like most places I've tried. The staff is very welcoming and kind, always serving you with a smile!"}
{"text":"Wanted to take my best friend who absolutely loves ramen out for lunch while he was visiting from Vancouver and decided to try Kinton based on recommendations. While I'm no ramen expert he assures me it was delicious. I opted for chicken, he opted for pork and we both came away very satisfied.   But the real star for me was the gyoza dumplings! MAN were they delicious, and they had this amazing ginger sauce! So so tasty!  The staff is incredibly friendly and the location is quite cool. Perfect for lunch with our best friend."}
{"text":"Didn't want to line up out in the cold so went around 11:40 a.m. We were seated right away but people who came after us were not so lucky.  We ordered the spicy garlic ramen with regular broth and pork shoulder.  I'm not sure what all the hype is about. I do love garlic but it was too overpowering so you can't taste anything else. The broth is not as rich as other ramen places downtown. I've had better ramen at Kenzo and Santouka. I will give it another try next time."}
{"text":"Really great lunch spot. Took forever to get the waiters attention tho, and the place was only half full. He never stopped by again after dropping dishes to ask our group if we liked it or wanted anything else. Ramen: original pork shoulder in rich broth with extra egg, corn and nori. It was delightful and not too salty, I wish they had had spicy but not garlic as a upgrade. Had the chika chika Don which I got solely bc of the name. And it was just the boringest thing in the world. That's a word now. Seriously with a name like that I was excited and instead got the most nothing dish ever. The Japanese tea was lovely and actually very pretty!"}
{"text":"They opened up a few locations now, the only one I have tried is the Baldwin village location. The pork belly pieces were thick and delicious, the noodles were cooked just right, and the toppings were great as well. However, the broth itself was way too salty. After trying Santouka, Sansotei, Isshin, I find Kinton's broth the saltiest and the only one so far that I could not finish."}
{"text":"It's really loud in this small space, but I love the addition of another ramen option on Bloor in addition to Kenzo.   They have an option of chicken or pork broth, which is a nice touch esp  for non pork eaters. The chicken broth is a lot more clean and allows you to taste the flavouring of the additions like Shoyu and Shio. The pork broth is really a completely different experience.   Lunch time, sat at the high tables, but the music was really loud and not really a great place for conversation. They had a good lunch combo for $12 which included a full size serving of gyoza today. It was all really filling.   Tasty, but I was thirsty all day afterwards."}
{"text":"A fine alternative if you FAIL to snag a spot (or arrive on time) for Yakatori Kintori upstairs, Kinton serves up delicious Pork Belly, Pork Shoulder, Chicken, too but in delicious steaming bowls of Ramen. A definite Win win!   As the second location, it doesn't lose its touch or style, embracing the same exposed wood block/grid walls, long counters with metal accents and stools. The menu is the same too, equally delicious Ramen in fatty rich broth, choice of pork, veggie, or chicken and thin or thick noodles.   I like the miso broth most, although it doesn't come with the seaweed sheets or perfect hardboiled egg (which to some, is very very necessary and to me a sad thing to let go) accoutrements, it packs the flavor I look for in Ramen. Pork belly is also the way to go, they torch that thick slab of juicy tender goodness like it's your birthday... even when it's not.  Spicy Chicken Karaage is a pretty good fail-safe too.  Overall, I like the second location of Kinton. It holds its own, serving the same great Ramen and sides you want and look for, not just from Kinton (aka. The Guu brand) but from a Toronto Ramen joint in general."}
{"text":"New location opened in Scarborough! It's finally here. I have been to the Kinton Ramen at the Yonge and Finch location, everything is relatively the same.  For more details on the actual restaurant setting, features will be listed below.  - Spacious - Casual  - Friendly Greeting by all staff members - Relatively loud music  - Consistent noise (do not expect to have a quiet one on one dinner date here)   The food is always tasty, I recommend the thick noodle option for a more filling ramen. However, the portions can seem smaller compared to other ramen restaurants! (They provide an extra charge for more noodles, if you prefer).   If you're not a big fan of salty foods you may want to ask for less salt. I personally don't mind it, however there will be an aftertaste of salt after your meal. But again... the ramen is EXTREMELY DELICIOUS so it's worth the aftertaste.  Overall, really happy to have Kinton in the Scarborough location!"}
{"text":"Ramen seems to be all the rage these days. My cousin told me about this place so I decided to check it out.  First, it gets busy, really fast so try to show up before or after peak hours or you might have to look like a homeless person standing outside in one giant line. The restaurant itself is one long hallway so space is at a premium.  So what did I try?  1. Original fried chicken... I definitely liked it better than the spicy version, which is drenched in sauce. I mean really. What's the point of crispy when it's soggy? The chicken really did nothing for me however. It was totes anti-climatic.   2. Did the regular ramen (can't remember the flavour) with pork shoulder. The belly part scared me. Also, I know that there is chicken on the menu but when their logo has a giant pig, you should order that... Just saying.   Some comments about the ramen:  I ordered regular and it was pretty rich. I mean you see bits of fat swimming in your soup... I can only image what thick is like!!!   Loved the meat. They boiled it and then use a hand held torch to toast it and brown it. It's pretty good and juicy.  I didn't order extra meat and I'm glad I didn't because it's a lot of meat...  Perfectly cooked ramen egg. Full points for that one.  Worth the pop in but I'm not sure I'm going to be at home dreaming about it."}
{"text":"BEST ramen we've had so far in the city. Atmosphere is loud and fun, soup consistency is savoury without being too greasy, noodles cooked el dente, egg perfectly soft boiled, all in all, delicious! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"One of the best ramen places in Toronto !  I have ordered their Shoyu Ramen and it was prepared to my complete satisfaction. Their noodles were cooked al dente, and it was made to order. When they ask which kind of meat you would like, request belly, the meat is more tender on the belly.  The broth was seasoned to perfection and I enjoyed the live atmosphere at the restaurant ! I will defintely be back for more bowls of ramen ! Kinton Bowler, Arnold L. over and out !   8/12/13"}
{"text":"Highly disappointing experience. Pork on ramen was served cold. I advised the staff who did nothing. I contacted head office who did nothing. There are so many better ramen places in Toronto. Don't come here."}
{"text":"Kinton Ramen was always a place I had wanted to dine at for a while now. When I finally went, I was greeted by a warm welcome and an atmosphere matching that. Thankfully I went at a time when it was not too busy. I have ordered both the Pork Original Ramen and the Shoyu Ramen. I have to say that of the two, original wins. The flavours of the ramen are very bold but not entirely overwhelming. It does have a porky taste to it, so if you enjoy meat, you'll love this ramen.  I ordered thick noodles because the thick ones are not even thick at all. The noodles are chewy and slurpable. The stunner of this ramen would have to be the soft boiled egg that comes with it. Its gooey and delicately mouth watering. The pork that comes with the ramen is cooked to perfection and two pieces of it is actually enough to satisfy you. I have also ordered the Original Chicken Ramen which has a lighter taste than the Pork Ramen and is really creamy. (I always recommend adding an egg to your Ramen!). I also ordered the Matcha cheese cake and it was really tasty as well! I fully recommend Kinton Ramen especially at this location."}
{"text":"- Really convenient spot downtown - Fast service, great staff - Spicy broth was very tasty! And the porc was amongst the best I had with ramen noodles so far! - Was not too noisy! We could easily hear each other!  Go try it!!"}
{"text":"Bazillionth time coming here and always satisfying. Had the pork miso ramen with butter and extra corn add some garlic and you've got magic in a bowl. Friendly staff per usual, also for 6 bucks you can get beer and dumplings. This place is one of the reasons I'm contemplating moving close by."}
{"text":"The ramen is wheaty, the stock is hearty, the meat is well-cooked. Even the nori in mine (I ordered shio ramen with pork belly) tasted better than any I've ever eaten! Not to be missed, even though the waiting can be a pain."}
{"text":"Went there for dinner with two friends on Sept. 5. Seated us at a table large enough for 1 person - it was a joke. Had to move to the communal benches. Ordered the regular pork flavored ramen. The broth had no flavor and severely lacked salt. There is no difference between the thin and thick noodles - they're identical. The meal was about 4 dollars more expensive than it should have been. This place is a gimmick. Food sucks, servers are clueless, seating is awful. 1/5"}
{"text":"Best Ramen in Toronto:). Get the original with corn and extra butter..with gyoza..yummy! Also the spicy garlic with added on cheese is good too.."}
{"text":"I want to love this place but unfortunately there are so many things I don't like about it. We ended up leaving and going to ajisen instead - much better.  First of all, I hate being screamed at when I walk in the door and then again when I leave. I guess they do it as a welcome and thank you, even though they could be shouting \"welcome, F***face!!\" And I'd never know.   They also don't have any vegetarian options, at all. That was the deal breaker, we had to go find somewhere else to go.  That being said, their ramen is quite good, but the miso is too thick for my taste - it feels like I'm drinking warm butter and I can't bring myself to enjoy it to the end. By about halfway I feel sick of it.   The interior is cute and chic, but unfortunately they don't cater to vegetarian demographic at all so I would avoid this place if that includes you."}
{"text":"I'm pretty sure Ive reviewed Kinton at another location and I had the same great experience. If I haven't... well, it was very tasty. The atmosphere, the decor, the clean bathrooms and friendly staff, all of it is top notch.  I got the pork original, fatty and flavorful. No issues. We ordered the fried chicken (karrage) with hot sauce, it was pretty good as far as battered fried bits of chicken go.   The wait was a little long for a ramen spot, I was a little disappointed by that."}
{"text":"Call me a ramen-addict if you want.  I love noodles, especially ramen.  Slurping ramen in the cold winter will keep you warm for a long time. :)  So far, Kinton is the best ramen places I've been to in Toronto (Kenzo, Sansotei, Momofuku, Santouka, Raijin)  It has a good balance of everything: al dente noodles, rich but not overly greasy/salty broth, enough toppings and meat.  I've ordered its shio ramen with pork shoulder with the extra corn.  It came with bean sprouts and one soft boiled egg.  Noodles were chewy but not hard. Pork shoulder was large, thick and tender. The egg yoke had the perfect runniness.  Unfortunately the egg was only lukewarm.  If it was hotter, it would have been 5/5.  Decor was trendy.  Female customers would really appreciate the fact that they offered a small basket for you to store your handbags/shopping bags. :) Washroom was also clean and well equipped.  So far I haven't seen other ramen places with such offerings.  Service was quick and very friendly.  Warning: this place is very small, and it gets packed all the time. Go there way before peak hours, whether it is for lunch or dinner.  I was there at 11:45am on Saturday and I had to wait in line already.  4.5 stars"}
{"text":"Finally, a Kinton Ramen opened so close to us! Hubby and wifey were beyond ecstatic as they are both huge fans of this joint. With Porkiebun in tow, they all decided to check this place out.  Thankfully, when they got there, the place was not packed at all which was not the usual for Kinton. No one was waiting to be seated so hubby and wifey were excited to satisfy their ramen, kaarage, gyoza and  takoyaki cravings! Little Porkiebun was also excited because Mama told her she's having noodles and dumplings for dinner.  A little over 15 minutes later, this hungry group was still waiting even to be acknowledged by any of the staff. Not one person approached us to greet us, to seat us or to even tell us what the heck was going on. Absolutely forgivable if they're busy, but they were not.   Eventually, a couple came in behind us and the man literally just went in and the server who was taking an order from a table directly in front of us near the door just pointed him to a random table. This was understandable as there were three of us in our group and the couple were directed to a table for 2. The man then proceeded to go on another table that was for 4 (looked dirty and has yet to be cleaned). I asked the staff politely what was going on as we've been waiting for awhile. I didn't even get a proper response as another couple came in and she pointed them to another table for 2. Thankfully, this couple was more polite and they didn't want to go ahead of us. I told them it's ok because we needed a bigger table.   Wifey and hubby still stood there at the waiting area for a few more minutes discussing the lack of service in this location before we eventually decided to just give up and leave. Even at this point, no one bothered to take the time to come to us and apologize and to let us know what's happening.  What a disappointment!!!!!!! To top it off, the Porkiebun started wailing when we left because she really wanted her ramen and gyoza. Hubby and wifey are both pretty forgiving when it comes to customer service, but it was non-existent in this place! I would have given it a 0 star if I could."}
{"text":"I'm a regular here and the service and food never disappoints.  Today my friend and I had:  Spicy garlic ramen 4/5 - tastes great. I enjoy the spice but get ready for garlic breath obviously  Classic shoyu ramen 5/5 - I wasn't sure how I would feel about anchovies in ramen but was surprise there was a bit of smoky flavour to it  Black sesame soy milk pudding 4/5 - was light and tasty. Had a great nutty flavour and wasn't too sweet for me."}
{"text":"After the meal I just had here, I felt the need to update my review.   My husband and I came here on Valentine's Day and I put my name on the waiting list right away. There were two couples ahead of us and a ton of other people behind us. People behind us started getting sat. Then the guy at the front was about to seat a five top that came after us, but looked at me and saw I was not happy. He quickly pointed us to a table in the corner that had been vacant the whole time.   It took a while for our order to be taken. We got a bit of everything. Drinks, apps, mains. Our beer took a really long time to arrive, which there is no excuse for - it comes  straight out of a tap. Our appetizers came out at different times and also took a really long time.   I got my food first and we waited for my husband's food to arrive. And waited. And waited. Nobody looked in our direction, so I flagged someone down to ask about the status of his food. They came back with barely an apology and said the person who took our order forgot to punch his food in. They slapped my husband's food together and because we got the same thing, we could really see a difference in the quality of his meal.   When it came time to pay our bill, we waited and waited and waited for someone. I made eye contact with multiple servers and nobody came up to us. So we went up and asked for the bill. We weren't offered anything for our terrible experience except a mousey apology from the guy that messed up (the same guy that didn't take my name down and didn't take my husband's order).   I understand it's Valentine's Day and it's busy, but there definitely weren't enough staff on the floor to meet the needs of the guests. If you don't want to pay for more staff, perhaps train them better. This is coming from a veteran in the hospitality industry. You could look around the room and see everyone's disappointment."}
{"text":"This is probably the best ramen I've ever had. I got the extra pork ramen and they really do mean extra pork. The pork belly was so soft and tender and the ramen was so good. All the flavors balanced really well. The service was also fun and load and entertaining. Definitely will be coming back for more."}
{"text":"I came here with my mom. I've been to the baldwin location and I thought that place was amazing but this place didn't quite live up to what I had expected. My mom had the original pork with pork belly. She felt indifferent about everything. I thought I would be more adventurous and have the original chicken with chicken breast. Everything was very nice overall but I felt that the chicken broth was a bit salty. Therefore, when the chicken breast absorbs the broth flavours, it becomes a bit salty as well. I think I'll stick to the pork options. We also bad the octopus balls (takiyaki ??). It would be nice if there was more octopus but it this is me just being picky. It had a nice crunch on the outside and nicely seasoned. Will definitely order again."}
{"text":"Went today, great service and great food! Totally vegetarian which is great. I ordered the Tofu Furai which was amazing and satisfying and the Goma ramen salad which was a nice cold option. I really thought the veggie options were great, just too bad that they aren't vegan. I added some pics on my blog's facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/mtlveg/ Check it out for more good veg options."}
{"text":"A very popular ramen place in downtown Toronto  Apparently this place always has a huge line, but luckily we managed to get there at the right time and got our seats right away! (The people after us weren't so lucky though). The ramen portion was small, but very, very flavorful, with small \"mountains\" of shredded garlic, a nice poached egg, and nice noodle texture. The pork was marinated nicely, and the seaweed was the real deal---none of the usual 2nd-rate soggy seaweed found at most ramen restaurants.  In terms of the decor, most of the customers were dressed nicely, and some of the younger folks seemed very excited to be let in and actually get a table, so I imagine this must be a pretty popular place in the neighborhood! The waitresses were kind and quick, the renovations were nice, and the music and temperature inside all struck me as a pretty modern place.  Would recommend stopping by if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Still probably one of my favorite ramen chains. I'm happy that i don't need to travel all the way to North York or downtown for ramen anymore either.   We went as a group. If you just wanted to try it out for the first time I would try to go before 5pm, they have combos that allow you to try an appetizer as well (better bang for your buck) I really like their gyoza personally. I think that the other locations are still better but I won't complain especially when this ones more accessible. Side note if you have a bottomless stomach after ramen, it's also in the same plaza as multiple bubble tea or dessert spots so - WIN.   Our group ordered the spicy garlic pork ramen (good if you want to clear sinuses or a cold, especially this winter season) and the special they currently offer. I won't lie, I ordered my go to spicy garlic pork ramen, but I tried the special from one of the other bowls at the table and I wish I ordered it. Will I be back? For sure."}
{"text":"Most visited spot for lunch since it's a 5 min walk from my classes Atmosphere is loud, the chefs and servers yell their greetings at you which  I guess is Japanese tradition. Broth is delicious for shoyu and miso. Very deep and rich Noodles are a bit bland, but not bad. The karage is amazing, if you ever get sick of ramen, get some karage or takoyaki with ton ton don."}
{"text":"Just a few bites from our full review -   \"Sipping on Calpico (light in colour, flavour and sweetness), we felt submerged in Japanese culture. Also, their homemade lemonade was thirst drenching, with lemon fibre floating, it was a simple yet impressive drink.\" \"The egg addition to both dishes was our best decision that day - it was done medium and upon biting, some of it coloured the soup. As per the waitresses' suggestion, we had a side of cheese. It was graded, Swiss cheese with a slightly bitter undertone which made the dish a bit more wholesome, as the chicken breast was quite lean. The slice of meat was, none-the-less, tender and light.\""}
{"text":"I read the reviews and since I do like noodles of any sort...I figured I should give it a try.  I read the menu and discovered it's all pork base so my seafood eating partner couldn't come so I went by myself. It was hot in there..I was sitting by the kitchen in one of the hottest areas of the restaurants.   I agree with reviewers that the noddles a bit underdone ie chewy.  But I didn't mind that myself. I got the regular broth and found it rich enough for me and surprised to find it fatty (can't they skim it off? I do when I make a soup)   I got the pork belly and found it to be tender ..though I can't eat that much pork fat.  But I do like the tenderness. I went for lunch, it's not a quick lunch despite being ramen.  Maybe it was the heat but it felt like  a bit of  wait for my soup to come.   I'd go back if it wasn't too busy and had a craving though if I  am with hubby we'll have to go to Kenzo so he can eat too.  Good but not out of this world."}
{"text":"they've re-vamped their menu and I don't think it's for the better LOL...I think it's the how can we charge the same price and maximize profits.    I usually get the pork ramen and combo.  Last time I was there I had the tofu side dish (forgot the name)...they are better than the takoyaki and I love those octopus balls... I think perhaps I was spoiled by the food truck at T&T outside food mart cause they specialized in the takoyaki balls...so good there.  Anyways,  so now the combo includes this tiny bits of chicken that have been mayo-ed on top of a bowl of rice.. hardly anything there...definitely not worth the combo anymore.  The other option wasn't much better...I think pork on rice... Second thing...the egg is included anymore...it was included if your ordered the pork...and now you have to order it as an add-on.  The pork belly didn't look as good either. My friend got that (pork & pork) and I opted for the chicken with pork stock.     hmmm not good..not good.  I might have to look for another ramen place to go to.  sigh****"}
{"text":"This is probably my favourite ramen place in Toronto right now. Every time I go I'm never disappointed. I always go around 6 to skip the busy hour cause it does get super busy around 7. My favourite is the miso pork ramen and their chicken kaarage!"}
{"text":"So expensive for a small bowl, thin pieces of fat pork belly, every condiments like garlic is an extra dollar. I am not happy. Better improve the quality of your food servings, and also, I hate your staff staring at the debit machine if I will put a tipbad attitude."}
{"text":"Since fall happened I've found myself in a bit of a ramen mood and have been trying all the vegetarian/vegan friendly places in my area. I had been under the impression Kinton couldn't cater to this but a friend informed me otherwise and I made my way there that very week. It was very early on a Saturday when I arrived (5pm) and thus the place wasn't too busy. I parked myself in the corner so I had a good vantage point.  The server came and gave me the menu. As I had seen online there were two veggie options: a ramen bowl and a cold noodle salad. I chose the ramen. It came out after about 10 minutes and I was surprised and what was in front of me. The bowl was half filled with what looked like tinned corn, seaweed, two small pieces of broccoli and two soy nugget things (the menu had listed tofu). The broth was clear and oily and underneath were very white noodles that looked kind of like 2-minute noodles.   I wasn't very impressed with the dish at all. The clear broth wasn't tasty or spicy, just oily. The corn was a weird choice, the seaweed didn't compliment it and the noodles just seemed cheap. The soy nuggets (in lieu of supposed tofu) did taste alright but I had to eat them immediately because they were going soggy. Even though I was starving I didn't finish the dish. I had no desire to eat all of the oily broth and scooping up so many pieces of corn and ripped up seaweed was far too time consuming.  Unfortunately the service matched the very underwhelming dish. I had to hail the server for the menu, ask for a fork, ask for water and flag him down twice for the bill. He didn't ask if I liked my meal, whether I wanted a drink or if I wanted any dessert. It wasn't even busy.  I'm very grateful that traditional Asian restaurants are starting to cater to my diet because I love their food. However, serving a bad vegetarian/vegan dish is worse than not serving one at all. These guys are a chain and thus this is pretty disappointing. The chefs certainly need to pay a visit to Ramen Isshin or Jinya Ramen and then maybe they'd see that the bar is a lot higher than they expected."}
{"text":"My experience was pretty average. I ordered the original pork ramen with chicken breast, and my bf had the spicy pork ramen with extra meat. For a spicy soup, it wasn't spicy at all. A 3-month old baby could have easily slurped it down. Granted, we eat a lot of spicy food but our taste buds are not dead. We asked our waitress if there had been a mistake but she simply said that's the way the chef makes it. Spiciness-level aside, the broth wasn't as flavorful as others I've tried.  On the upside, the meat was tender and the noodles nicely firm. The terrace was pleasant as that section of Bishop Street is fairly quiet. I'd also like to mention that our waitress was sweet and attentive, which we really appreciated!"}
{"text":"I ordered the pork belly miso soup thick noodle. The basic ramen only includes the noodles, meat some corns and that's it. For $12~14 (correct me if I'm wrong). If you want more add-ons, $1~2 per item for seaweed, egg, mire corns and etc. In my opinion, relatively pricy for ramen.  The noodle itself is not that bad, not good, but not that bad. The noodle was raw, so really hard to chew; the pork belly was slightly over cooked as well.  The service was great, the waiters were awesome (2 stars for them, else it would be 1 star, but the wait is way too long. We were there around 4pm, so not the busiest period of the day, we got seated right away. Then we waited 30 mins till we got our orders. What? Just 2 noodle soups took you 30 mins? Also they slightly mixed up our orders, that's fine though."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of the Kinton by U of T. I used to frequent there often when I was a student. So it breaks my heart to say that the worst KINTON location is this one that's close to home.   Greeting was mediocre - half assed no energy yell at the door. Monday 9pm, I can imagine that they're tired, but it's the KINTON experience we're looking for.   Staff was just moping around.   Though it wasn't busy, we waited long for our food.   The chicken arrived before plates were handed to us. And no one was making rounds to pour water.   Noodles seemed to be thinner than the usual thinness. The spicy garlic was definitely spicer than usual. Normally, across all the locations of Kinton, the soup bases and noodles taste the same, but at this one, it was definitely different. The food was still good though.   When it was time to pay the bill, even though she noticed we weren't paying with card, she just kept staring at how much money we were putting down. Not only did that make us feel awkward, but she was obvious that she wasn't happy about the tip. If you want a real nice tip, come around to pour water, ask how the food is, and don't be acting rude.   Not visiting again though."}
{"text":"This Kinton is really busy around lunch! There's always a line and the turn over for each table is about an hour! You have to ask for water multiple times when they're busy.   Their flavours are always consistent. Their seasoned egg is delicious and perfectly made, and my favourite is the Spicy Garlic Pork. I've never had to complain about my order.   The karaange is also very very good. It comes with 4 pieces. Not sure if it's dependent on the size of the piece, or what.    There's a lot of street parking around, but it can be tough to find a spot. Make sure to not park in front of a hidden lane way!"}
{"text":"Kinton, your noods are good but no. Just no. I know you're new so I can forgive the slightly disorganized service and slower response times. But given the glaring service issues I experienced in the nearly 2 hours I spent in your establishment (not that I wanted to be there that long), again, just...no.   Coming in, I knew I had to wait 30 mins for a table because any new ramen place attracts the horde. What I didn't expect was the 45 MINUTE WAIT TO GET OUR FOOD. Now let me elaborate why this made me angry, and no it wasn't just because that's an absolutely absurd amount of time to wait for noodles.   1) The people to our side that sat down at the exact same time as us FINISHED their ramen before we even got ours. But wait, it gets even more ridiculous.   2) The people that were LINING UP at the door when we were ordering got their ramen and also FINISHED IT before we got ours.   But wait, surely we were at least given our appetizers to stave off our hunger in that 45 minute wait. That brings us to more glaring issues.   3) We ordered 3 orders of karaage. About 25 minutes after ordering, we get 1 order of karaage. Certainly, the two others must be following soon. NOPE. They come out 20 minutes later with our ramen, long after the first order became cold and sad.   4) As the server is bringing the long-awaited order of karaage, he evidently drops one piece. Well, mistakes happen of course but most certainly, he will bring out another piece right away...right???? NOPE. My friend waits 10 minutes and asks \"So...you're going to bring me another piece of karaage since that one fell right?\" Another 10 minutes pass before he finally gets it.  Ok, so we finished our food in about half the time it took to get to us. Time to just pay the bill and leave. Simple. So simple. BUT NOPE.   5) In the beginning when we were ordering, we were informed that we can only split the bill 4 ways between 5 people. That's ok, we decided to group together some orders. We spent a good few minutes doing this so the server knew exactly which order would be on which bill. We saw him writing it down in a very orderly fashion so that it wouldn't be a problem when we pay. IN THE END, everything came back to us on one bill anyway. So what was the freaking point??   Again, I know new places aren't the most efficient. But come on. I'm not even including the fact that we had to ask for water and it took 20 minutes just to get a coke, which I had to ask about also. I don't think I've ever been to a place where you had to ask twice for literally everything. Kinton, your servers were nice but getting noodles really shouldn't induce this much rage. Congratulations. You earn the achievement for elevating my hangriness to levels I didn't think possible.   (10/100) - 2017"}
{"text":"Visited this restaurant for a second time this passed Friday evening. They do not take reservations so I understand that there will be a waiting time.   Upon entering the doors, there was nobody there to handle the incoming guests. After 5 minutes of waiting, someone finally came and took names down (keeping in mind that customers are standing wherever they can, therefore names are not written down in order).  All staff are very nice though. I waited for a table of 4 people for approx. 20 minutes. Order taken in timely manner. Myself and 2 other friends ordered their special (Paitan Cheese Supreme ramen) which consisted of chicken miso broth, shredded swiss cheese, sliced mozzarella cheese, chicken breast, corn, and ramen noodles. When our ramen arrived, we realized that all of our bowls were missing chicken. We told the server, but nobody did anything only followed up. We called another server over to help us and they served us room temperature chicken on a plate. The chicken is really good though once you warm it up under your noodles. Overall, not the best ramen I've eaten. Their tapas are pretty good, but avoid their calamari if you hate ketchup.   I also ordered the \"Bamboo\" cocktail which was a mix of melon liqueur, lychee liqueur, white wine, and soda. Barely any flavour. Tasted like carbonated water with a hint of flavour.  Great staff with great personality. Very nice and polite. Small restaurant, but great atmosphere; it's cozy."}
{"text":"First kinton ramen location in sauga! The same quality as you would get downtown. Delicious but there's still a line up. I would say it's a much bigger location than other branches though."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch by myself, waited 40~1hourmin still no food. I asked them what's the hold up since I see other people who came after me get their food and I really need to get back to work. They told me they forgot/ mess up my order. Wasted a lunch and went back to work on an empty stomach. I was also sitting at the bar in front of them, how could they forget? Could they not see I had no food infront of me? Absolutely terrible service."}
{"text":"So happy Kinton finally arrived in Scarborough. Very busy even on off peak hours. Our first visit was a disaster, wrong orders and slow delivery of food. They managed to do a good service recovery by giving us a free gyoza and an apologies from I guess the manager. Came back to give it another chance. This time they were superb! I guess they just recently opened on our first visit and they were still getting a hang of the service. Would highly recommend Kinton. Definitely the best Ramen place in Scarborough"}
{"text":"Sorry to compare with yokato yokabai,I was here last night...I ordered the original chicken ramen ,I thought the broth was a little bit salty and the portion is a little bit small than yokato,I did't add nothing....so my soup has only egg et sea weed....no beansprout.....no corns....if u want some ..it's another dollars extra...so I thought the price is higher than yokato.....but it's good for the people if u want some ramen in downtown...."}
{"text":"Was ok. No surprise. Soup was not as flavoured and noodle was so so. But service was good and generally it's not bad!"}
{"text":"Decor was modern and pretty. It was pretty packed, but did not have to wait at all to get a seat. Some seats are too close together, my back was touching the girl behind me (stools, not chairs). It took maybe 50 min for the food to come. There were more people waiting than eating. One bowl of ramen was only served warm, didn't risk asking for a new one in case it took another 50 min. Food was not bad but not good either, not impressed. Only 2-3 pieces of meat. Not a really big portion of noodles either. Not worth the wait, and not worth the price. Definitely do not go if you're hungry."}
{"text":"It was okay - I would say it's pretty close to Sansotei in my opinion, but the broth is a little more richer here, which is something I enjoy!   3.5/5"}
{"text":"I don't know how this is considered a hot spot.  Maybe i just came on a bad day or Ramen isn't my thing.  I ended up paying $13.55 for soup stock and noddles.  There was barely any chicken and it was rubbery, like I couldn't cut it, and a tad pink.  It looked under-cooked.  The egg, GROSS. mushy and tasted like sushi.  Again maybe Ramen isn't my thing.  Second star is going to service.  It was phenomenal.  They were very nice and super quick.  Too bad."}
{"text":"Food is okay, I order a pork ramen with Thick noodles with miso soup base as well as 1 order of takoyaki. It didnt really went beyond my expectations with the food taste. However, it was not so bad either also the place is very simplistic and I really loved it. Staff are super kind as well :)"}
{"text":"I love noodles. No really, I do. I consider myself a noodle aficionado. With that in mind, I went to Kinton Ramen on Bishop to grab a bowl of \"chilled ramen\", also known as a tsukemen, with my dining companion grabbing a pork based spicy ramen.  The noodles were bouncy, chewy, and tasty. However, they could have been a tad thicker for the Tsukemen, making it less salty in the post-dipping process"}
{"text":"I ordered Miso pork. Generally it was good. The pork belly was way too fat... The soup was tasty but could not be saltier."}
{"text":"If you like waiting for a long time (over a hour) for rude services, this is the perfect spot. This place is hot as it is the hype, do not go if you have a party of 4 as the wait is even longer."}
{"text":"Still one of my favourite ramen spots in downtown Toronto. Aside from Sansotei it clearly beats out the likes of places like Kenzo or Santouka in my opinion. Flavours are usually quite rich and it always leaves me wanting to finish the entire bowl at the end despite what my diet tells me to do! Still come here occasionally though so it's always a nice little treat."}
{"text":"Tried out this new location for lunch. I got the spicy pork ramen. Broth was super flavourful and the noodles were perfect. Only downside is that portions are a bit small but you can always order sides. The atmosphere is really nice here too."}
{"text":"Definitely good.  Has a lot more potential, its a small shop/resto, atmosphere is good however, would recommend more selection in the menu,  In addition there could definitely be better added options to the soup like mushrooms, or beef, or tofu etc.  I found toppings to be quite limited. I know its all about Ramen, but a few other things on the menu wouldn't hurt.  My biggest issue is how SALTY the soup base was, the flavour is good but all the soup bases are extremely salty, and therefore Im not sure if I would come back.  Literally had to pour half a glass of water for it to be edible."}
{"text":"SInce this place opened, there was line ups out the door, so we decided to stop by one day and try it out. The service here is amazing, everyone is so friendly.  we waited for about 25 mins for a table for 2 people which was OK, since it was a nice day, however I don't know how people will wait in the extreme heat/cold of Toronto weather.   The food: the fried chicken (spicy) was delicious. The noodle soup felt really heavy (she did ask if we wanted light or reg) We went with regular soup base and it felt really FAT. also you can choose pork shoulder or belly, we tried both, however there was only 1 piece in each soup. I would say the noodles are very normal, nothing special. Not worth the hype or the line ups (this is only because the place is really small!)"}
{"text":"Delicious.  This is my go-to spot in Toronto whenever I visit for work. The menu here is very simple and consistent. The last time i was here, i got a side of \"cheese\". Guys, if you haven't tried having ramen with cheese, please do-- This is a game-changer.  All-in-all friendly staff and friendly environment for a quick bowl of ramen."}
{"text":"Generic bowl of noodles.  The appetizers are the real attraction."}
{"text":"I ordered the karaange ramen with extra egg and the original porc ramen with thin noodles. I find it snge that they only serve the karaange ramen on Mondays, you can't order it during the other days...  - karaange ramen: they were really generous with the fried chicken portions. I had to share it because I wouldn't be able to eat it all on my own. The fried chicken was juicy and flavorful. Even though it stayed in my broth for a really long time, the crispy crust was soggy. However the found the broth to be a little bit \"powdery\"... Not sure how to describe it... The noodles were perfectly chewy, just the way I like it. The seasoned boiled egg was amazing, really worth the extra money in my opinion. I didn't expect it to be that good. - pork broth thin noodles ramen: the broth is \"creamier\" than the karaange ramen one. It is not too thick, just on point. The pork meat was tender and had a good proportion of fat and lean meat, and it was seasoned.  - sesame pudding: they didn't have the matcha cheesecake so I ordered the pudding instead. The pudding tasted nice, you can taste the black sesame, but I feel like the consistency is a bit too runny to be considered a pudding though...  Probably the ramen that I enjoyed the most so far compared to the ones I got at Imadake and Kinka, but still haven't tried the ramen at Misoya yet. It is on the more pricey side especially when the extras can add up quickly."}
{"text":"sapporo + lemonade = IDEA for my own party mix!!! deliciously expensive for such a small champagne glass!!~  Karaage -- small dish .. 4 pieces of crispy chicken.. TOO lil for its price and I had better!!~  ramen = I had better , but only comparing to L.A and New york!!! In Toronto , there really isn't many comparable Ramen places!!~  I had the spicy ramen --- good flavors.. meat was soft...   I enjoyed this spicy ramen soup base better than my friend's order of the seasalt ramen ... lacking the excitement of flavor -- but he really enjoyed it since he had the Extra MEAt in his bowl ... He said it would feel too heavy if he had all that meat with a really really strong flavored broth. He really enjoyed his simple soup base with the tender pork.   We went on a weekday and didn't have to wait at all --- for a table of 2 , we were seated right away around 6:00-6:30pm? I think we made reservations as well.    I would go back and try the other broths!  Can't go with a group at all --- its a pretty small place.."}
{"text":"Meilleur Ramen Vegan à Montreal! Leurs Tofu furai est excellent!!!!!!   Un vrai délice"}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place more.....  The positives:  the service is great and they are so very cheerful and nice, the seating is good at making you feel you are in a Japanese restaurant with their quaint tables and seats, LOVE the spoons that come with the dishes (don't listen to the reviewer that complained about them - they are cool, useful for scooping up the noodles and other ingredients being slightly square, and old yes but clean so do not get rid of them) and the prices are very reasonable at $12.99 per without add-ons.   The negatives:  the broth is the key with great ramen and it was very cloudy (meh ok I can get past that) but something just seemed off.  My hubbies spicy option was quite hot indeed (good) but jalapeños really?  He tasted mine - the Classic, and thought it better, the huge chunks of pork belly on mine was good but again something seemed not quite right.   So the end result is I just made it back to the hotel and my hubbie was not doing that great either. Can I say it was the food?  Not definitely but putting 2+2 together this time does make 4. My husband said he'd try it again, me no."}
{"text":"Monday Karaage Monday                     or  Karaage Bloody Karaage  Unbeknownst to me, time after time I've come to Kinton Markham purely on Mondays.  I have been recommended the \"Mondays Only\" Karaage Shoyu or Karaage Spicy Ramen on the special menu and I've ignored that recommendation time and time again, this time I've finally gave in and it dawn on me I'm a Monday Kinton Monday type of person...  Karaage Shoyu Ramen $14.99 ~  As a fan of Chicken Original ramen, the Karaage Shoyu Ramen seemed hopeless. The shoyu was one note not delectable while the mount of bean sprouts at the bottom propped up the thick noodles that had alkali scent taking away from the \"crispy soggy\" chicken pieces.  I left thirsty and confused.  I'm starting to be alert of the term \"specials\", it's been losing meaning for quite some time."}

Nice addition of a farewell gesture with the loyalty card for free items after many returns and also the option to have you and your friends get a picture with the crew to post to their facebook page.  This was a nice experience."}
{"text":"Amazing during cold weather. 1st time but not the last.  Just try it, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Service is very slow. First visit, I waited 40 minutes for my food. Second visit, I waited 25 minutes. Music is constantly blasting very loud. Meat needs more seasoning, and is pretty dry. Noodles and broth are fine. I'd visit the other Kinton locations next time for a better experience."}
{"text":"Had a fly in my bowl of ramen, called the waitress over, and she offered me a new bowl which was nice. But she then went on telling me how it's 'fly season' and that it's normal that the lamps (directly above the heads of seated customers) attract flies and that sometimes they will fall into the bowl and that we customers, should be careful about this. She even suggested me to move my chair to the side and eat at the corner of the table. I was bewildered by her treatment, however I just acknowledged her excuses and went on eating my 'new' bowl of ramen, which was most likely the exact same bowl."}
{"text":"I have been waiting for a long time for them to show up in Scarborough.  So close to home.  This place is very trendy.  I love the style for announcing customers, food and saying goodbye in Japanese.  It's inexpensive, fun and the food is delicious.  I can't wait to go back for more.  Staff is very friendly and the place is very busy so arrive early.  Take your time and enjoy your food, its not a dine and dash kind of place."}
{"text":"Came here for a late lunch on a Friday. Surprised that it was still packed but we didn't have to wait and got 2 seats at the bar. Menu had only a few items focusing on allowing customers to customize their ramen. I picked pork broth with thick noodles, in orginal soup. Be careful here since with this option because it is not clear the soup base options of thin, original and rich seems to refer to how much fat is adding to the soup. My wife ordered rich soup and got lots of fat floating on top of the broth.   Overall we enoyed our experience here from service to food. Soup was not the best but rather on the salty side without too much natural umami flavour but still very good. Go with orginal pork broth seems to be better then the other ones.  This restaurant is still a very popular ramen shop so make sure you have some patience with the staff. They are working hard and trying their best."}
{"text":"My dad and I have been waiting for this location to open. We usually go to the ones at Hwy. 7 which is farther.  The place is slightly smaller than the one we use to go, but everything else is almost the same! Food wise I notice that the meat is chewy and that's about it. Everything else tasted fine. We got some tokayaki and karaage chicken, both were good as well. Definitely coming back here again. Just hope they improve on the meat quality."}
{"text":"Restaurant atmosphere was very loud and alive. Waited 15 mins in a line in this tiny door way entrance leading to this tiny space.  Took longer than average for our ramen to come, got spicy garlic pork ramen with thick noodles and shoyu ramen with thick noodles.   The spicy garlic ramen wasn't the best flavored soup, I wasn't impressed and didn't really enjoy the soup so 'garlicy'. The pork in my soup was cold, the noodles were slightly undercooked  and the broth wasn't tasty.  The shoyu ramen broth was much better but a tad over salted, pork was also cold, tough, chewy.   I wouldn't reccomend."}
{"text":"Delicious broth. Average portions. The pork was sooo tender and big slices. I was very disappointed in the noodles. The noodles were generic and not gummy texture like like good noodles should be. But over all decent food. The wait time was over 30 minutes and they weren't busy. Bad timing decent food."}
{"text":"Everytime I come to this restaurant I don't bring any expectations. Everything is really just \"okay\". The food is okay, the place is okay, the service is okay. At the end of your meal, your belly might be full but your heart will not. You will just feel empty and emotionless, because of the \"okay\" experience. Basically what I am trying to say is that you do not want to experience what I experienced."}
{"text":"Ramen thats absolutely delicious and very customizable, I find the location to be clean and very modern. The location is small, but love the seats with the kitchen view.   The washrooms are private and absolutely amazing, I was so surprised to find that the restaurant provides mouth wash in there washrooms."}
{"text":"My friend recommended Kinton to me; he even said that it was best ramen joint in Toronto.  Really?  I love the decor - it reminds me of ramen shops in J-land with the high stools and facing the folks who prepare your bowl.  It was way too loud - the employees here really need to relax and take it down a little. (Okay, before I sound like a jaded old lady, I'll talk about the food... )  Food was okay. I don't really like tonkotsu ramen (pork based soup) and the soup is pork based. I ordered the pork based w shoyu flavor ramen. It was a-ok.  I'm glad that I checked it out. Not coming back will be a-ok.  3 stars."}
{"text":"Great place for lunch and dinner. They have a great lunch special that includes an appetizer for about $12. Their ramen is consistently delicious and the portions are bigger than Kenzo, although they will not make you full to your stomach. I rate this higher than Kenzo because it seems more authentic, plus the staff is just so much better. I always get the shio ramen, and it never disappoints. A must try!"}
{"text":"My favourite favourite FAVOURITE ramen in Toronto is from Kinton; spicy garlic ramen with thick noodles, light OR regular broth (depends on how I feel the day of) with pork belly. Delicious. I always get the appetizer and drink special to add on for a couple bucks extra: gyoza dumplings with a small Sapporo pint! Loves it :)"}
{"text":"I'm so happy to finally find a ramen place that serves ramen the way I like it. You have the simple choice of chicken or pork, original/soy/miso/spicy and thick or thin noodles. They're serving ramen right. Serving it the way they would want it, instead of making customers choose what toppings to add to it.  Perfect balance of salty, comforting and delicious! Generous on the meat and the egg was cooked perfectly. Overall I left a very satisfied customer and I will 100% come back."}
{"text":"Go to ramen joint! I love the fact that you can almost customize everything from soup base to toppings. First you can choose the type of soup base- miso, spicy or shoyu etc, you can also choose the richness of the broth- light/ rich. then you can choose either thick or thin noodles. I Love the rich shoyu broth with thick noodles. Then you can choose which portion of meat you like. Lastly, you can choose the toppings. Some of the toppings include: seasoned egg, cheese, garlic, corn etc. Cheese is a must! The restaurant is quite small, so I would recommend going early to avoid line ups. The staff are pleasant as well. It's a fast past environment. I also recommend the deep fried chicken, comes with mayo! Super Delish."}
{"text":"I love Kinton ramen so I was excited when I heard about its new location, which is very close to Ryerson. The servers and chefs were all really polite, but I wouldn't say that this place had the best service. They messed up my order, so I had to wait around 20 minutes for my food, but I didn't mind since they so nice and apologetic about it. Usually when I'm at a Kinton restaurant, whoever finishes their entire bowl of ramen will be granted \"bowler\" status, and the workers will take a photo of you and your bowl and give you a stamp card to accumulate points - everyone who eats here knows that this is what Kinton is known for. However, when my friend finished all of his ramen, the employees here did not do anything about it or even acknowledge it at all. I was excited for him to get his photo taken because it was his first time, but nothing happened. I wish they would have made a bigger deal about it like the workers do at other Kinton locations.   Aside from that, the food was good and the people are very friendly."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Kinton, not only because their selection of ramen is delicious, but also because they're all made consistently across all of the locations. Kinton Ramen on Church is one of the newer locations, situated in the same area as Kinka Izakaya.  Like the other Kinton locations, their regular ramen choices are present. Pork or chicken broth, with several configurations of fixins available. However, unlike other Kintons, they also had a special available for just this location, which is called the Rich Tonkotsu Shoyu Ramen.  I am a huge, huge fan of rich ramen broths, and it's hard to find in the city, so I had to try, and my goodness is it good. I think at this point, it's in my top 3 bowls of ramen available in Toronto.  Overall, Kinton on Church had great food, great service, and I can't wait to go back and have another bowl of rich tonkotsu shoyu."}
{"text":"Just came back from visiting Montreal for business, and luckily timed it with the opening of the new Kinton 6, which is one of my favourite ramen joints in Toronto.  I sat by the counter and ordered one of my favourites: miso pork ramen, rich broth, thick noodles, and an extra seasoned egg. The food came quick, it looked exactly as I expected it to, and it was just as delicious as it is back home.  Thinking further, one of my favourite things about Kinton is their consistency. You get practically the same quality across their six locations.  I'm glad Montreal now has one of my favourite ramen joints!"}
{"text":"Came to this Kinton Ramen location because they had a special on the menu that piqued my interest: the peanut butter ramen.  It sounds ridiculous, because who thinks of putting peanut butter into ramen?  I am a fan. Seriously.  My bowl came, and it was a very hot bowl of thick noodles, without a regular broth, but with a very thick sauce covering the noodles. The pork belly and lotus root sat front and centre and really caught my eye. The strong, rich smell of the peanut butter made my mouth water, and I quickly mixed up the noodles and the fixins before taking my first bite.  Yum.  Rich, deep flavours of peanut and pork. The crunch of the lotus root and cucumber provide nice texture. The thick noodles absorb a lot of the flavour, and it really helps to give it a good stir.  Peanut butter ramen aside, service was friendly and quick, per usual, and I thoroughly enjoyed my meal."}
{"text":"Food is terrible Service is good.My chicken was half cold and salty. My takoyaki balls are not better either. Look like they did not do a proper microwave my meal before serving. I will definitely not come back. And the restaurant was not even half full"}
{"text":"Now I'm starting to think if yelpers are part of a evil conspiracy when they write these amazing reviews on the food and you come there and food taste like butt. Anyway, I gave this place a try and went there on a lovely Sunday afternoon. The place was busy at the time I came but everyone was already serve and just there eating their meals. Me and my bf order chicken kaarage and two bowls of pork shoyu. The chicken kaarage came out hot which is great but the taste was very average, expensive and wouldn't think about ordering that again in the near future of other ramen places. The ramen came out relatively quick, I wasn't waiting more than 15 Mins and I'm usually fine with the wait time if I notice that servers are busy and as well as the cooks. You can't always be expecting them to fly out food like a machine, people are people BUT as long as the food taste good for the price that they throw at you. So, the ramen noodles were hard, not al dente but hard.. the broth was bland and had some type of weird taste. I'm not sure how I would describe it but it was not tasty. After eating it, I actually got a headache. I was really disappointed that this ramen place was not up to par with people's expectations nor do they achieved borderline of any expectations, I saw a lot of people hype this franchise up but it was just not for me. I'm the type that likes flavour to my food , for example pho, the broth gives you a kick to the face with depth and flavour. The end."}
{"text":"I have tried the Kinton Ramen on Baldwin and recently I have tried this location. I have to say that I do prefer this location compared to the Baldwin location. I thought that the seating in this location was better than the Baldwin location. At the very least I wasn't squished next to the person I sit next to trying to use my chopsticks to eat my ramen. The broth for the ramen was good but I thought that the noddles were a bit hard. Overall my experience here was much better than the one I had at the Baldwin location. The servers were all very nice and I like the decor of this location - very hip."}
{"text":"Kinton' broth is definitely my favourite and their atmosphere is nice if going by yourself to sit at the bar/or with one other person. this location has only  a bar, a 2-3 seater high table and a long patio chair where sometimes you get to sit with other rando ramen lovers. theyve changed their customizability now.. in the past you was able to change the level of richness in broth which I thought separated them from the other restaurants but no more. way more authentic than ajisen but I'm not even Japanese so why listen to me?"}
{"text":"Been here a few times and every time it's been great! The prices are pretty good for what you're getting (these are filling bowls of ramen!) and the servers are very attentive. I would 100% suggest this place if you're looking for a good ramen bowl! Their appetizers are delicious too, I'd recommend the fried chicken. It gets busy so go before the rush!"}
{"text":"I come here maybe 5 times a year, it's worth returning to for some good fix of ramen! The service is really friendly. Last visit I enjoyed their summer menu.   I ordered the chilled ramen, which was dry noodles, pork and nori with a side of quail egg, Wasabi, ginger, and sauce similar to soba dipping sauce. After you mix everything in, the noodles taste very strongly of garlic and sesame, which I really liked. All the other flavors are mild, with some saltiness from the sauce. The quail egg doesn't add much to the dish.  My friend ordered the roast beef ramen with yuzu sauce, salad, mayo, and half seasoned egg which I think is the best dish in Kinton by far. Soooooo good. I'm considering coming back to try that soon.   I've ordered the Don dishes in the past and they're not worth the money, unless you're getting them as a combo for $2 extra. Even with that it's only worth trying them once. It's just rice, shredded chicken/pork, and mayo/sauce and nothing more. It's their ramen dishes that really make them special!   Overall, their prices are very fair given the portion and the quality."}
{"text":"This is the first time I've been to the Markham location, I have been to the Yonge street location twice and was not let down!  This one is much more spacious than the Yonge street one, it was a wait but only about 15 mins, mainly because we came at around 6:30 which is prime dinner time, which was expected. When we left, there was nobody waiting in line and a ton of available seats!  I tried the cold ramen, which is my go to! It was really refreshing with the crisp, cold veggies, and a creamy sesame sauce. We got a spicy chicken as an appetizer and it was really delicious but we put the sauce on the side because we weren't sure how spicy it was going to be (heads up, its not spicy at all, just has a bit of a kick). My boyfriend got the soy sauce chicken ramen, and that was very tasty. All of the ramen is customizable (except for the cold ramen salad), which is neat!  My only complaints were the seating, it wasn't too comfortable and there was no where to put your jacket, except on a hanger by the front door. So unless you want to risk having your jacket stolen, I suggest leaving it in the car. Also there were a couple of benches, so there is a chance that you will sit with a couple of strangers during your meal. All and all it was a pretty good dining experience, and left very satisfied with our meal!"}
{"text":"when you go inside they say hello in Japanese  got the pork miso and it was absolutely delicious  definitely better than a lot of competing ramen joints  the pork is very tender and melts in your mouth and the soup has great flavours. noodles are cooked perfectly so yummy the prices are average and the portion is decent. something I wish it would include is soft boiled eggs like other ramen places  I also got the matcha cheese cake and I loved it. it was quite small and expensive but the taste was just the right amount of sweetness and balanced with a green tea flavour. although it is small it is filling because it's cheesecake then when I left they said bye in Japanese and it felt awesome  I would definitely come again and they have opened a location in Richmond hill that is closer to me"}
{"text":"Kinton Ramen has been in the Toronto ramen scene for a while and they know how to deliver a solid experience.  I came here for a post-swim meal and bot did they deliver.  The atmosphere at this location was buzzing with a mix of bar, small table, and a big high-top wooden table seating.  They had a very intriguing November special of nikusui (sardine broth) ramen but I settled for the pork miso ramen on a slightly chilly day.  When the pork miso ramen arrived, it looked very appetizing.  The pork broth was the right amount of thickness that felt very hearty and warmed the soul.  The noodles were cooked el-dente and had a good resistance to them that held up against the rich broth through the meal whilst I was chatting away with my friends.  I wouldn't recommend the kari kari rice ball appetizer special.  It was a very crispy rice ball with some pork filling but I thought it lacked much flavour.  The staff asked me to take a picture on their IG as a Kinton bowler and I happily obliged. In reality, I didn't really want to slurp that last spoonful of soup because I was way too full already but they probably overlooked that small oversight. I think it probably went on their IG wall of shame lol."}
{"text":"Found myself here after a Macallan scotch tasting at the Shangri-la.  Can't beat scotch and ramen in the same night! :)  This is what makes Toronto awesome.  Ordered a large bowl of shoyu ramen with extra noodle (although it did not feel like they put much extra noodle in their at all) but the broth was thick, warm, and flavourful that would satisfy on a cold wintery night in February.  The noodles were cooked a little el-dente with that slight chewiness that makes you appreciate it.  The piece of pork belly was generous and packed with flavour too.  Made up my mind that I will try the spicy garlic ramen next time I visit Kinton."}
{"text":"Kinton is a very noisy and bustling place, one of the more popular ramen places at the moment. It's gets busy very early so be prepared to wait for a spot during lunch unless you arrive at 11:30 AM or earlier. The waitresses are polite but they will make you stand close to the door and constantly urging you back against the coat rack.  The place is incredibly small and all the seats are high stools. You can either place your purse in a basket that they'll provide you at your table or in between the legs of the stool on a little shelf that's been designed into the chairs. The seating is communal so be prepared to sit close to your neighbour.   The chefs are positioned in the middle of the restaurant, and you can watch them cook from most spots in the restaurant. The regularly shout greetings to the customers and are generally quite gregarious. Unlike most other ramen places, the typical bowl of noodles doesn't come with a soft boiled egg, so if that's a must-have for you, make sure you add it to your order.   My friend and I both ordered the spicy garlic ramen with pork shoulder in regular broth. When it arrived, there was a generous serving of minced garlic on top...this is most definitely not for the faint of heart. The meat was beautiful torched and caramelized making the fatty edges just so unctuous and melt-it-your-mouth... I was in ramen heaven! The noodles had a good chew and the broth was very rich and flavourful, with a good amount of heat.  The only downside was that I felt that the bowl had too much bean sprout compared to noodle. It kind of felt like filler. Still, in the race for best ramen, I would put Kinton ahead of Kenzo and Ajisan, but behind Sansotei. Overall, a good addition to the Baldwin neighbourhood."}
{"text":"I can't comment too much on the food since I was only able to eat the rapini and edamame here, but the service and atmosphere could not have been any more disappointing. Firstly, if your restaurant is facing west, would it not make sense for you to have curtains covering the windows so the setting sun during dinner time isn't blinding the eyes and burning the faces of your customers? This place has apparently been open for two months and still don't have curtains up, but apparently they will be putting them up this coming Monday.. I sure hope that's true because nothing about dodging the sun while eating makes a meal enjoyable.   Something else that make our experience unenjoyable here was the service. I came here with my boyfriend's grandma and so we preferred to sit at a table with a bench so it'd be easier on her back (there are two types of seating - one that is a short stool and the other that is a bench). The server was very resistant on letting us sit at the table with a bench because they are apparently only reserved for families with children, but there were many tables with just adults sitting on the benches. What I'm confused about was why they made such a big fuss about it- they clearly saw we were with an elder and there was no one else waiting for a table at all, so why were they so unwilling to let us have that seat? The restaurant wasn't packed at the time and we weren't taking the seat away from any family with small children.. anyway, they let us have the seat, but that already set up a bad experience for the rest of the night that followed with being blinded by the sun.   I would also like to mention that the waiter gave us an order of thin noodles when we asked for thick, and acknowledged that he made a mistake but didn't offer to give us our right order at all. After saying we asked for thick noodles and not thin, he just stood there and said, \"oh, these are thin noodles\" with a blank face.   There are much better ramen restaurants within the vicinity with much better service and vegan friendly options. I definitely won't be returning here and really can't see why anyone would because their service was just that bad."}
{"text":"Summary: thick, flavourful broth makes this a great place to satisfy a ramen craving, if you don't mind a smaller place!  Top Must-Get: pork ramen! Top Regret: lemonade  Tucked in the corner of the Commerce Gate plaza, it's right before you turn into the underground parking!   SERVICE Sunday evening, full house. Had to go on the waitlist. Ordered at 710 pm, drinks arrived 718 pm, food at 725 pm. Place is small, and they make do with smaller tables, so it can be a bit uncomfortable if you like your leg space.  If you finish \"every last drop\", you are eligible for a \"kinton bowler point\", and they ask you nicely if you can take a promotional picture with them.  Our table was physically a little rickety and uneven, which was somewhat surprising since this place just opened. Not a big deal, but it did detract from the experience a bit.  FOOD Original Pork Ramen: very good broth - rich and went down smooth. About four slices of pork, very tasty! I would probably get the \"extra\" next time (extra $4.50 for \"three times the regular portion of pork/chicken\")   Noodles themselves were alright - you can pick between thick and thin and I chose thick. 4/5  Vegetarian Ramen: comes with two tofu nuggets, which were good - as long as you're not expecting them to taste like chicken nuggets. Broth was also very tasty. It's a bit pricey for a vegetarian meal (same $10.99 as the pork ramen) but they do load it up with broccoli, corn, seaweed, carrots, cabbage, and bean sprouts. 4/5.  Homemade Lemonade: was highly recommended by the server, but it was average, leaned towards the sour side. 3/5  Shirley Temple: tasted more limey than I'm accustomed to, but pretty good. 3.5/5  Big Eater bonus: you can order extra noodles ($1.90) only at the time of order. That's a bit unfortunate if you're not sure you're going to love it.  I'll be back to try the appetizers, desserts and chicken ramen!"}
{"text":"Came here at 10 pm on a Friday night. Lucky for us there was no wait at all. We ordered the takoyaki, chopped pork rice, and two ramens. The takoyaki was average. The rice with chopped Pork was somewhat dry and plain. Ramen-wise, the noodles were very chewy, but they didn't have much of a taste. The broth was tasty but extremely oily. Pork belly was however on the salty side.   Our food arrived promptly, and service was good. Our bill came up to $50, which I guess was reasonable given the amount of food (plus two drinks) we ordered."}
{"text":"For now, a 3 star. Went there for the soft opening. The service given was quite good, but the wait times were pretty long, even when it wasn't busy. So if you're coming for a quick bite, this is not the place.  The chicken kaarage was quite good. Hot, crispy and juicy inside. The pieces were quite big but for 6.9 and only 4 pcs, I feel like it's a bit on the expensive side.  The gyoza was ok.  The meat in the soup was cold, but the broth was very flavourful.  I'll probably come back, but at off-peak hours."}
{"text":"LOVE.  Only missing a star because it's super hard to get into.  Never been there and haven't had to wait at least 30 minutes.    Not a totally bad thing- they're just that tasty.  Staff is super friendly.  Kinton Bowlers!"}
{"text":"Brought my son here since he is a huge Ramen fan. The Baldwin location is really nice and the service was perfect. I had the chicken shoyu Ramen which was very salty and my son had the Pork Ramen which is very good. Broth is so thick and rich I wonder how they cooked it. Just a side note - the bathrooms are very interesting with free q-tips and mouthwash. A nice touch and super clean."}
{"text":"Wow, this place is so disorganized. Came in and there are already 5 people waiting in line just to give their name, yet no employees in sight. More people keep coming in and cut to the front thinking we are just waiting for our tables, but in fact we still haven't checked in yet! A tall young boy with an attitude finally comes 5 min later and records one person's name (who came in after me and others still waiting in line) and then tries to walk away ignoring everyone else. After I yelled at him to come back, he records my name and before I have a chance to ask how long the wait is, he's off again. Unbelievable...   Not going to wait an hour and put up with crap service just for some ramen, so went elsewhere and not coming back..."}
{"text":"One of the best ramen in Toronto I must say! The noodles were Cooked to perfection.. Nice and eldante how I enjoy. The soup wasn't too salty and the pork wasn't over cooked. The portion is a little big. Service is great and location is very clean. I brought my coffee in and although they had to hide it for me while I had my dinner there they still remembered to give it back to me at the end. Would def come back and bring more friends"}
{"text":"Got the miso soupbase this time and it was exactly like the DT locations! the noodles and pork belly are always cooked perfectly ."}
{"text":"The ramen here was delicious. I had the shoyu ramen with pork shoulder. Of particular note: the seasoned eggs are delicious (maybe the best I've had), and the pork belly had an amazing sear, giving it a wonderful flavour. On top of that, the broth was excellent. Not the richest ice ever had, but then I had ordered the normal broth (they also have a rich option). The gyoza were also good. At just under $45 (tax and tip included) for two lunch specials + drinks, the price was more than reasonable (by Toronto ramen standards, at least). I look forward to returning to try more types of ramen."}
{"text":"The vibe and service here was very pleasant. There was no wait time and it wasn't as loud as I was warned about, then again I went on a Tuesday afternoon.   For 12.90 (lunch special) I got the spicy garlic ramen with pork shoulder and a side of two fried pork gyoza. The pork gyoza was delicious and better than I expected it to be. The soup was very filling and came with lots of noodles and a big dallop of garlic on top. The noodles were cooked perfectly, the pork shoulder not so much. Some parts of the meat were very hard and some just too chewy. Also I was disappointed that the spicy soup was not spicy at all.   Be warned that garlic is the superstar of this dish and the broth is very flavourful and VERY garlicky. If you plan on being in close proximity to someone for the rest of the day or taking public transit be prepared for people backing away from you. But if garlic is your thing it's worth it."}
{"text":"Came here to try their fried chicken ramen, only to be disappointed to find out it is a Tues or Mon special only. What a drag. We both got their ramen combos with their pork don and the takoyaki. The good thing about the combos were the fact you could customize it to your liking with your choice of thick or thin noodles, heavy to light broth, whatever else you wish to add (price extra). We ordered their spicy garlic ramen with pork belly. Very very strong garlic, that left our mouths feeling ah-may-zing. But all joking aside, after eating the ramen our tummies did feel a bit off. We think it could be the way they store their pork in the tupperware containers that are always being taken in and out of the fridge. We noticed they're left on the counter where they cook the pork belly with the blow torch, the warmth may cause some bacteria to grow on the pork because it is still raw and in outside warm temperatures then back into the fridge. We sat at the front bar seating facing the cooks inside the kitchen so we just figured that may be why we didn't feel good. Found the pork don side a bit too dry for our liking (needs a sauce), but the takoyaki was good.   Overall, the ramen/service was good but not sure if we will be back."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner last night, this location is new to the area since I've last visited. I find it is comparable to the other location I visited before, however I find I got more pork belly at the previous location versus this one? The vibe was louder than the one I went to before, so it was very hard to talk. We ordered chicken karage, and two exact same pork miso ramen, thick noodles, pork belly + add an egg. Overall, the food was good and minus the noise levels getting high I would say this is a good addition to the area."}
{"text":"Today all ramen was $5.19 so I finally decided to give Kinton a try. There was a huge line up for the anniversary but luckily my friend and I didn't need to wait! Ordered the Pork Spicy Garlic and it was great. The broth was spicy- not too salty, the pork belly was soft and tender and the noodles were al-dente, perhaps more on the undercooked side. Probably because it was very busy and they're in a rush so it's alright.   Had a good time, my only complains are that the wooden stools are very uncomfortable to sit on since there's no support to lean back in your seat. Also every time a customer comes in,everyone screams a greeting in Japanese. It's fun the first few times but after that it got tiring to hear. Kinton was good & I wouldn't mind coming back !"}
{"text":"I've been here about five times and every time my ramen is delicious. My favourite is the miso. I go for regular broth and shoulder. Rich, filling, tasty. The cheese ramen is also good, as well as the spicy garlic.  The service is okay. Annoying that they don't let you sit down until you're entire group is there, especially since the entrance area is cramped.   Clean and has nice washrooms with hygiene products including mouth wash and q-tips."}
{"text":"Our favorite go to Ramen place of all times!  Their service is impeccable and the broths are all so good and they allow substitutions if requested. I personally love their spicy garlic broth the best..good for my sinuses :p"}
{"text":"We went on recommendations of a friend since we like ramen and Kekou Gelato is down the street.  There was only about a 5 min wait on a Thursday night.  We like how they have the specials where you can get a side order with the noodles.  I got the spicy garlic with pork belly and regular soup.  The noodles and the pork belly were good but I didn't think the soup was a flavourful as Sansotei's.  We also ordered the takoyaki as the side dish and they were OK, but not the best tasting ones that we've ever had.  There was a tiny piece of octopus in them.  Others at the table got the gyoza which had a nice spicy mayo type sauce and an order of the rice with pork.  We found that the music was WAY TOO LOUD for regular conversation.  We had to yell and repeat ourselves to be heard, even by the waiters and waitress.  Eventually we had enough and had to ask them if they'd turn it down a bit (which they were very considerate to do so).  Even so, using Bose speakers, it was still loud and shrill (too much treble).  I think we will go back to Sansotei for noodles and come up here for the gelato next time."}
{"text":"I finally went to Kinton! For years now, I've heard that it's either great or it really isn't worth the hype. I'm leaning towards the latter in a very strong way. I'm actually surprised at how let down I felt.  My cousin and I ordered a bowl of the original pork with thin noodles and got a side of chicken karaage.  I didn't know Kinton did a whole egg, but I certainly wasn't expecting a brown lump of an egg in my noodles. I should be thankful that it was softboiled and that a whole egg meant I got two halves, even though it wasn't aesthetically appealing. That being said, the rest of the bowl wasn't aesthetically appealing either. The two pieces of chashu were haphazardly dumped in my bowl. One was round and one was rectangular. Is that typical? I've never seen that any other place. The kicker was the soup though. Ramen broth usually looks thick, but this looked goopy. As in congealed, but still hot. It was bizarre. It felt goopy too. Think shark fin or hot and sour soup consistency. As a whole, the ramen was not at all aesthetically pleasing. For me, camera eats first. I can't remember the last time I didn't take a picture of my ramen. What a disappointment.   Does Kinton's original pork tasted like wonton soup? Imagine it. Thick, congealed, wonton soup. That's what it tasted like to me. I actually bothered to drink half of the entire bowl of broth because I couldn't figure out what I was drinking. It didn't wholeheartedly suck, but it definitely wasn't what I was expecting, and while not entirely unpleasant, it also wasn't entirely pleasant. The noodles were a tad overcooked for my liking as well, and I like my noodles on the cooked side. The only saving grace of this meal was that the chicken karaage was good. It wasn't great. It was good. The garlic sauce was rather tasty.   To top off a rather odd ramen experience, it seems like there was some kind of equipment failure because someone on staff kept banging on something very loudly. It got to the point where people at the bar seating were looking over to see what on earth was going on. It was very disruptive.   This was the least pleasant ramen experience I've had in a very long time. In fact, I've had food court ramen in Toronto that's better. That being said, I've heard the original Kinton location is better than this one. I'm still willing to give that one a shot."}
{"text":"ERMERGERDDD!!!! Such good ramen! The place was always busy, and the turnaround for tables is pretty decent. I had the Miso ramen with pork, and my friends each had the Spicy Garlic with pork. And both of them liked my better, so guess who had to share?!?! Yep. It's that good. Their fried dumplings are pretty bomb too if you're getting the combo...it's a really good deal. Coming back fosho!"}
{"text":"I went to their grand opening when they offered their ramen bowls for 50% off. There was a long line during lunch hour but the staff handled the crowd as best they could. When arriving near the door, the host took the orders of everyone in the party. When seating was available, they quickly showed us to our table. There were times when the host did not know where to seat patrons and at times, people were moved to accommodate the crowds.  The ramen was pretty good but we needed to ask the server for water. At times, they needed to ask patrons to confirm their orders. The location is around the same size as the one in North York.  The location is slightly east of Yonge on Eglinton where the subway construction is happening so it will be dusty for a while. When I left, the line got longer even after the peak lunch hour."}
{"text":"I had heard great reviews from the other location at Baldwin but never had a chance to pass by as it was always busy. When the North York location opened, I needed to give it a try.   There were lots of people who wanted to try this location with a huge line everyday. Either you test your patience or try again on another day.  Larger groups are difficult for the restaurant to accommodate especially since it is small and they request that everyone be there when you are seated.  They ended up splitting a group of 6 with 3 tables of 2   If you are a group of more than 4, make sure you arrive early with everyone there.  The ramen was average in my opinion.  I think the staff was working out with the details as they had opened up only a few weeks.  The portions were smaller than I expected especially when me and my tablemate each only received one piece of pork belly. It seemed like the kitchen was having trouble with lack of pork belly and needed to ration the rest so the long line of people can have some.  Overall, fairly disappointing when comparing to downtown ramen houses.  I do not think I will return for a while until they fix everything."}
{"text":"Great ramen. A bit pricy but great value."}
{"text":"Very happy that my favorite ramen place from downtown opened here in Mississauga now! There were a few quirks that I saw with this location but I'm sure in time they will get better. The waitresses and waiters aren't familiar with the place (they kept getting tables confused and bringing the wrong food to people). They brought out my friends food before mine - so far before that he was done eating by the time I got my chicken! Therefor, I have to knock a star off for these encounters.   The food was great, the chicken karaage was soft and juicy but perfectly crispy on the outside. My friend didn't say much when he was eating because he enjoyed his pork ramen so much, and he's a bit of a ramen expert so... I assume it's good! The matcha cheesecake was the highlight for me. So creamy and delicious!! The perfect amount of matcha flavor, not too strong or bitter, just how I like it! I was surprised by how tiny it was though. I wish I ordered two!  I'll be coming back for sure. Love kinton!"}
{"text":"The service here is extremely slow. Takes 30-40 minutes for them to bring out your food. Other than that, location is decent, and the place is decorated nicely. The staff aren't the friendliest.   My boyfriend ordered the original pork ramen with extra pork, I ordered the chicken shoyu with added veggies and egg. We also ordered a kinton bun pork belly bun.   The pork ramen was delicious. Probably the best ramen I've tried to date. Super tender meat and great broth flavor. The chicken was meh, definitely had better. Wasn't anything special. The pork bun was yummy and the presentation was cute."}
{"text":"Went for the first time today and it was amazing! We ordered the original beef ramen with thick noodles and the original karaage which was delicious. Good portions and reasonable prices, will definitely come again!"}
{"text":"A friend and I decided to stop by at Kinton for lunch. We've been to Kinka several times and decided to give Kinton a try. The place is very tiny seating is not ideal but understandable - they do have a coat rack to check your coat in. Now for the food, we ordered a hot karaage which we loved! Its basically really fatty fried chicken covered in sweet tangy hot sauce! My friend ordered a chicken miso ramen and I had the jalapeño ramen - I tried some of his but wasn't the biggest fan, he loved his though. My jalapeño ramen was perfectly seasoned and very flavourful on its own however I do like to add additional spice so I also asked for the house-made hot sauce on the side. I'm so glad I did. The sauce is amazing - it's kind of like chilli oil but better, it is bursting of sesame flavour (I love sesame!) and garlic! All in all great place for a quick lunch on a cold day!"}
{"text":"Yup. Found it. My favourite Ramen House this far. Previous critics claim the soup is too salty but we found it Perfect.   I chose the pork miso thin ramen. At first I was annoyed that a \"seasoned egg\" costs extra but now that Ive tried it, i wont hesitate to order and pay for it again. The soup and pork were wonderfully flavoured. The portion looked small at first but even as hungry as I was I couldn't finish it!   My friend got the combo (with the spicy garlic pork ramen which they enjoyed) and selected the gyoza and the sesame dessert. OmG!  The dressing on the gyoza was mayo like with a twist and very tasty. The sesame pudding dessert is light and worth going back for just for that!   Our gripes were that my friend's egg was over cooked, the seating isn't very comfortable, and the 2 Caucasian cooks kept screaming  In Japanese... Really really loud! At first it was funny, but then it just got super annoying. Tip: Dont sit at the bar unless you have to... You'll lose your hearing.   This location is out of our way (we just happened to be in the area) so Im really hoping that the quality and taste at the other locations are consistent.   Overall VERY happy we stumbled in!"}
{"text":"My favourite ramen place, and the big plus on this location... NO COOKS SHOUTING!   The food is consistent with their other downtown locations, and if you prefer the saltier broths, i recommend the pork miso. Super yummy and tender meat.   seating is scarce and this place is busy round the clock, but it's still tops in my book."}
{"text":"Soup and ramen is good but the value equation is a bit off.   Two small pieces of pork and very little ramen for the price they charge.  All hype and no real substance!   Was it bad?  No!  Was it great? No!   Just your average ramen combined with a long wait.   I think I expected more."}
{"text":"Best ramen I've tried in Montreal so far! Make sure you try regular pork ramen with thin noodle with garlic oil. My husband ordered thick noodle and it was a bit too chewy for him, but if you prefer chewy/hard noodle, you would probably like it. They make good karaage as well (huge portion compared with those I've tried in Japan, had to go in the end) Friendly staffs and relaxing environment, will visit again for sure."}
{"text":"Interior was clean and trendy. They yell welcome to you in Japanese like the izakaya places. It wasn't too busy. I went on Tuesday night for dinner with some friends.   My friends ordered that cheese ramen ($15) which looked pretty good! Lots of cheese, tons of corn at the bottom and you could even ask for a spicy jalapeño base.   I had the original chicken base with thick noodles and garlic oil ($1 extra). Wow. They gave a LOT of garlic oil. The chicken breast tasted alright... Mildly tasted of chicken but I think it's because of the overwhelming garlic oil, which was totally fine by me.   I took off one star because their soup was too salty. I eat a lot in one sitting, so the kinton bowler was no challenge for me but that salt could make the dead sea quench your thirst.   Other than that, I recommend this place It's a \"yes.\" from me. :)"}
{"text":"For 3 weeks ive been watching documentaries on where to eat the best ramen... and well i live about 10000km away from the closest one. Then I came here. In the heart of downtown Montreal, under a newly constructed condo lays I think I legit ramen place. The decore is casual and the good on point. I ordered a miso pork ramen which came with a cheap beer (if you want)  Extras sucks as egg or sweet corn are extra which inbound weird but worth getting. My overall experience was great and i can't wait to go back and try something else.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"very good ramen, soup was not too salty, both the chicken and pork soups were very yum! one of the best ramen places so far.   same owner as guu - now kinza. another location on baldwin but i've never tried there."}
{"text":"This is definitely tops for Ramen.  I had the original and the 2nd time, the shoyu.  Both were not too salty, had plenty of noodles and additions that set just the right amount of taste. Love the atmosphere and staff attention. Thanks for a great dinning experience"}
{"text":"Delicious ramen, pungent gyoza, and juicy chicken karaage made Husband and myself super duper happy!  Kinton Ramen was talked about from one of our friends for the longest time, so during our December holiday vacation, we made a point to check it out. Be warned - the space is not huge, and it is narrow. If you've not visited a ramen shop in Japan, this will come across mildly claustrophobic. However, don't turn around!! The food's good!  We came on New Year's Day around 12:30pm, and were happy to hear that they were open regular hours. Being prepared to wait, we were ecstatic to hear that we only had to wait 5 minutes! The waiting area is practically nonexistent, and it was pretty cold outside, so I'd advise that you come bundled up just in case you have to wait outside. I think the staff is pretty considerate with regards to keeping their patrons warm, so the turnover rate is decent.  So we went with a gyoza appetizer (4 pieces for $3.50), original chicken karaage ($4.80), and 2 bowls of ramen: 1 miso, 1 spicy garlic. You can pick your broth in terms of intensity and consistency (light, regular, rich), and since this was our first time, we went with regular. We both went with pork belly (you can choose pork shoulder, but who doesn't love pork belly?! :P). The broth was so good, and quite rich. I can't imagine what the rich broth is like. The miso base was light but had a nice smooth fermented flavor which we love. The spicy garlic broth was pretty spicy surprisingly, and that big ball of garlic on top? Add it little by little, as it is very potent in its entirety. A tad salty, but not too bad.  Noodles were plenty for me, but not enough for Husband. For the men in your life, you'll probably have to spend the extra $2 to get extra noodles. Make sure you mention it when you order, as you cannot add it once you've received your bowl. Aside from the broth, a wonderful ramen experience is the noodles, and Kinton makes excellent noodles; not too thin and not too thick. They're more flat than rounded, so they soak up the broth very well.  Gyoza and chicken karaage were tasty and great portions. The chicken had a slight edge over the gyoza, as it was perfectly crispy and juicy. 6 big pieces were the right amount for 2 to share.  We had a great meal here, and even though space is tight, we'd come back here again. The staff was friendly, and the chefs were animated and fun to chat with. We got to sit in front of the kitchen, and it was clean and organized. These guys got it down to a science!  Definitely worth checking out if you're in the Downtown Toronto area."}
{"text":"I've reviewed the original location, and while most of the time I prefer going to a restaurant's original storefront, this occasion required us to try one of their other locations.  This one specifically is in the North York area, and convenient for those who don't want to trek all the way to downtown. It's not really that far in mileage, but if you add surface street traffic, and weather conditions, it can easily take you 40 minutes from the suburbs to get to the Baldwin St. location.  Food quality is the same I'm happy to say. We both ordered the original pork with thick noodles, pork belly, in regular broth. We also added a seasoned egg (which was DYNAMITE!). They now offer combos which are a great value if you want a side. Choices range from gyoza, takoyaki, tofu furai, and edamame. For an additional $2, the portion sizes are on point. Flavor of the broth was great, and not salty at all. LOVED the torched pork belly and the sheer size of it. Super yummy. You can request additional, but I think it's an additional $1-2.  The space itself is slightly bigger than the original, providing a coat rack near the entrance, and some space for waiting. Orientation is identical to the original.  Service was great, but we did come when they first opened on a Sunday. It was quiet, and relaxing; we really enjoyed that. However, once 12:30pm rolled around, the place quickly filled up. The men and women who run this place are efficient and sweet.  Note: If you're planning on coming here with a bigger party (more than 3), I'd suggest calling to see availability, as they only have 1 longer table near the front of the restaurant. Otherwise, you will be faced with a wait, and a rather long and painful one.  Washrooms are around the corner downstairs. Very clean, and have both a modern and zen black decor. Tranquil music plays in the background.  I'm glad that they have retained the quality and flavors that we had experienced during our first visit at the Baldwin St. location. Since we do not live nearby, I just sincerely hope that it continues to be that way because it is one of our favorite places to eat when we come to Toronto.  Enjoy, and don't forget to sip on a hot pot of green tea! :)"}
{"text":"Always great service. The original pork ramen is my go to along with spicy karaage and shared with my partner. We are always full once finish our meals. I must have visited this location 5 times in the span of 30 days! Great ambiance, best part is the washroom even has mouth wash!"}
{"text":"Kinton ramen was one of the first places I ever had ramen. Back in my dairy loving, meat-feasting days, ramen was my go-to food. No wonder I was 28932983lbs. I actually haven't been to many ramen places since becoming a veghead.. but this place opened up in Markham and word on the street was it's poppin. Ya girl had to pay a visit.  First, I looove how big the place is. I think this is the biggest kinton to date? Many many tables, for many hungry millennial mouths, I'm sure. I went on a sunday evening and it was pretty empty, which is probably why I didn't experience the atrocious service I read about on these other reviews. Oooof, that's rough. The service was pretty average. We were kinda ignored at the door until I gestured for a table for 3. They seemed kind of distracted, which happens a lot when a new place opens up.   There are many choices on the ramen but definitely not vegan friendly. The ramen noodles have egg in it. Regardless, I had the vegetarian ramen (hey, the vegan sassqueen does the best she can). It was underwhelming.. I've had full vegan ramen before and without the creamy broth, it just tastes ..meh. Don't get me wrong, it wasn't bad but I wasn't like \"holy $%#@, this is so good\". It was packed with veggies though.. but so much cabbage.. hmmf. One thing I love about kinton is the tofu nuggets.. because they're legit in the shape of chicken nuggets and have that crispy outer layer chicken nuggies have. Nooommm. The veggie ramen had 2 of them and they were on point. I think it saved the dish, tbh. Next time, I'll just get tofu nuggets as a side dish because they made my tastebuds crave more and more.  Everything is pretty on par with the other kintons except they don't work as fast. It's probably because the new factor and they have more physical space to cover.  We'll see. I'm neutral on this for now."}
{"text":"WOW! This ramen place definitely surprised me. Now, I'm not a huge fan or noodles or ramen in general. Except pho, I fucking love pho. But ramen... has never seemed to impress me before. I've tried various places, like kenzo ... but it was all mediocre at best.  I came here with my boyfriend after work and as soon as I walked in, I realized it was a traditional izakaya kind of atmosphere, with loud greetings and cheerful yells. Not as annoying as guu though.  Anyway, one bad thing is that the tables are super small with not much space to put bags or anything else. I don't really like the idea of hanging my jacket up on a rack that anyone can have access to either.  I've never seen a ramen menu like this before, you get to pick exactly what you want in your ramen and exactly how rich the broth is and how thick the noodles are.  I tried the pork ramen with miso flavour + chicken breast & I chose the option to have the rich broth. It was amazing, and soooo filling. I definitely couldn't finish it, so I made my boyfriend eat it all so we could all be 'kinton bowlers' (anyone who can successfully finish an entire bowl of ramen down to the last drop). They also have a reward program for various prizes with every bowl of ramen finished ... 1000 bowls finished = $1000 gift card ... omg is that even possible!?!  Also! Give the takoyaki a try!! It's delicious and unlike any of the typical street market ones. Absolutely amazing. It comes in 4, and I think it's around $4-5. Not bad.  The waitresses are super friendly, even though some of them have almost zero english skill. It's ok, I'm good with communicating through hand signals. She also gave us free gyoza coupons for next time, so we will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"My favourite place to get ramen! This place is often busy during peak times. My favourite is the pork spicy garlic. I would recommend adding and egg and corn. Original karage is great for an appetizer."}
{"text":"This review is based solely on my experience for takeout. The Taste was good as expected but the portions were ridiculously small I ordered two chicken ramen one was spicy and one regular the spicy one arrived with three thin slices of chicken  weighing less than 100 grams the the one with the regular sauce arrived with two slices of chicken that if you wrap them up they would be the tip of the Q-tip and one boiled egg. The total for the order was $29 and in both plates there was less than half chicken breast Noodles & Water. So for the taste and the quantity and the quality this was an insult to my intelligence. I think they have a great location and very good potential if they straighten the price / portion ratio"}
{"text":"It was not bad, but there are too many new ramen places better than Kinton. North York one is better."}
{"text":"I used to frequent this place ages ago. I learned what good ramen was here.  Now, their eel hotpot simply can not be beat.  Want authentic Japanese taste is a cute and intimate space? Konichiwa!!!"}
{"text":"I moved here from Vancouver a few years back and have been looking for a great Ramen house here in Toronto. Until tonight, I have been completely disappointed with the lack luster Ramen in this city, and Kinton finally brings us a great authentic bowl of Ramen. I'm happy I don't have to default to the imitation Ramen coming out of Kenzo and Ajisen anymore."}
{"text":"This place has good quality ramen. I've tried their miso, shoyu and chicken soup bases. I love the pork belly and shoulder. If there's anything that makes this place unique is the kind of meat they serve and how they prepare it. The egg is a popular addition to the ramen dish and is simply delicious. Sometimes, the soup can be a tad salty at times. It is a bit on the higher end in terms of pricing for ramen but it's definitely worth a try. It has a nice atmosphere and very friendly staff. Washrooms are cleaned, well maintained and private rooms.I've been a regular customer here and it is my go to place for ramen. I've finished 30 bowls here making me a 30 Time Kinton Bowler!!"}
{"text":"Kinton used to be my 2nd favourite ramen place until this recent visit made me reconsider.  My friends and I (4 total) went to this Kinton place around 7.30, 8pm on a Sunday. The place was packed but we did not wait long to be seated. The service there was very slow! It took about half an hour to get our orders. I know that they were busy and all, but I've never been to a ramen place, which are usually packed, where I waited 30mins. We requested our bill from a waitress who forgot about us and we had to ask another waitress for it.   For the food, I ordered spicy garlic; my favourite ramen at Kinton. However, it didn't taste as yummy as I had in my souvenir. The broth was thicker than the ones I had downtown. But overall, the ramen was 3.8/5.  This visit was a turnoff for me and most of my friends. But I may give it another try in the future.   Service: 3/5 Food: 3.8/5 Price: 3.5/5 (spicy garlic $10.99)  Cleanliness: 4.5/5"}
{"text":"I came to Kinton Ramen with rather low expectations and left pleasantly surprised. See/Eat: Tsukemen.  I came with a group of friends on a Saturday night and oh boy, it was packed. We ended up waiting close to 40 minutes, but I'd like to say that was worth the wait. I ordered the gyokai tonkotsu tsukemen and was just blown away by this dish. So this is a dipping noodle dish with seafood and pork broth and that broth was the star of the dish. It was incredibly rich and flavourful - it was a good level of spicy, with all that garlicky goodness and there was braised pork (dissolved) in there, giving you some meaty substance with each slurp. The noodles were obviously thick (for that optimum dipping goodness) and was cooked just right. There was enough toppings in chashu, bamboo shoots, egg and everything. Everything complimented everything wonderfully and it's just a fine dish from top to bottom, no complaints here!   I did also get the chiki chiki don and would not recommend that. Chicken resembling canned chicken with mayo on rice wasn't anything special.  Intangibles include music that was way too loud. But they're definitely going for that lively experience here.   I'll definitely be back to try their other ramen! Do try their tsukemen, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Ambiance: Just like many Japanese franchises, very energetic and cheery. Loving the wooden block theme, especially for the walls. Not so much for the seating though. I wish they had actual chairs instead  (while still maintaining the theme of the restaurant...perhaps have the same type of seating but with a back to the chairs?). Also the restaurant is rather cramped...not the fault of the restaurant but it would've been nice if the restaurant was more spacious.   Service: Friendly staff. A bit inattentive. I was waiting to get seated at one of the bar tables (rather than in front of the chefs since I was waiting for my friend) and a customer that came in right after me got seated at the table that I was waiting to get seated at. The table was given to me however when the customer suddenly decided to leave after a few minutes of sitting down. If that customer had not left, I probably wouldn't have gotten that table. The service did improve after my friend finally arrived - definitely much more attentive once we officially sat down and ordered our food.  Cleanliness: Seems A-OK to me! Haven't gone to the bathrooms though but when I came in to visit, everything looked clean.  Food: Takoyaki balls could have been better. There was way too much batter. However, the sauces and tempura flakes made up for the lack in octopus meat. As for the ramen that I had tonight, I ended up having the miso pork ramen with thick noodles, and seaweed. The broth was really good! You also get a good portion of noodles. The ramen noodles themselves were just a tad bit undercooked. The pork had a slightly odd smell to it, almost like sweat. There was also bits of pork fat floating around the broth but I guess I should have been more mindful and ordered pork shoulder instead rather than pork belly. The scallions, seaweed and corn along with the broth made up for the less than savoury pork though. Pricing-wise, it was a bit high, especially since you have to pay an additional $1 to any extra toppings (some toppings were as high as $3.50!). Overall, portions were very generous and fills you up quickly.   ***  Overall, I was a bit let down by my experience at the Kinton Ramen on Yonge. The overall quality of the pork and noodles could have been better and the service was a bit standoffish. In comparison to the one on Baldwin, the Yonge location was so-so. If I do feel down for ramen and I'm in the area, I'll probably end up ordering something different instead. Maybe they were just having an off day? For now, I would say that the Baldwin location is much better in terms of the quality of their food."}
{"text":"One of amazing hiyashi chuka I had. This is something I would love to have in the hot summer day! Well, what makes the 2 stars less? I found it pretty weird hiyashi came before regular ramen. Also the eggs were fully cooked unlike how it was served in the past. Will I return? Yes! I still love their ramen and hopefully this was just a day they slipped :)"}
{"text":"I came here on a Saturday afternoon. It was quite busy. As soon as we came, a line up started forming at the entrance. We were seated at one of the side tables near the window. The seats had no resting pan, so it was quite uncomfortable without something to lean on. Also because of the seats we had no where to hang our coats. There was a coat rack at the entrance but all the coat hangers were occupied, so we had to keep our jackets on which was quite uncomfortable. However since the weather is warming up, I believe that wont be a problem.  We got the original chicken ramen which was $11.99 and original pork which was $10.99. There are different flavours and noodle types to choose from. The noodles came with 2 pieces of meat, an egg, a seaweed, and some green onion. The portions were quite small. The broth was flavourful but quite salty. I had to drink a lot of water afterwards. But the food came out fresh and hot. I just came back from Japan and had a lot of ramen, so maybe there was some comparison there. This place is some what authentic, but overall I thought the food here was a little salty for me  Service was efficient. Staff was friendly. Atmosphere was modern and clean."}
{"text":"I love the design.  After eating the pork ramen which was by the way, tasty, I had a really bad case of the runs. I don't know why but I cannot digest authentic rich ramen very well. Maybe if I try spicy garlic, I wouldn't have the same problem.  I hear if you can eat a whole bowl of ramen including the soup, you can get a point stamp."}
{"text":"Reside at the famous Baldwin Street, I love that area! I went for lunch a couple of times, it was very busy there!  Usually I order the Spicy Garlic Ramen, it's delicious. Dumplings are not bad.  Food Quality: Ok, nothing really WOW me though Service: Busy place means you have to grab the server for their attention Price: Ok Overall: Good, I wish more choices"}
{"text":"Service is ok, restaurant was packed and we can see the open kitchen. Ask for the ramen I ordered miso regular soup and thick noodle with pork shoulder while hubby got spicy garlic on rich soup thick noodle with pork belly. Noodle itself is nice and chewy, soup was ok for me and pork is completely tasteless (2 slabs of pork shoulder slices, unspiced, maybe boiled then charred with blow torch). Hubbys ramen is very strong on the garlic and not spicy for a spicy ramen. Overall I dont enjoy it much"}
{"text":"Had the fried tofu, squid balls and fried chicken for appetizers. Love the fried chicken. Cooked to perfection. Ramen was tasty and came hot. You get to pick how you would like the Ramen and garnishing. Service was quick and friendly. We did go really early on a Saturday night. Had to catch a show downtown. Lovely decor and ambience. We sat at the very front on a cold day but the heating was excellent. Had the sesame soya desert. ...to die for! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Love their ramen and the servers was very welcoming. The price was pretty good for the ramen portion that we get"}
{"text":"Got the takoyaki to share and a Spicy Garlic Ramen, which was flavourful and not too spicy for my taste. Service was great - one of our servers was very friendly and attentive. There wasn't a line when my friend and I arrived Friday night. Not a 5 star because besides the pork and garlic, there weren't other toppings, like egg and seaweed, in the ramen and it had high salt content, which left me parched after the meal."}
{"text":"Got there at 7 30 on a Thursday night and it was super busy.  I ordered the spicy pork ramen. Noodles were so undercooked and a bit hard...soup was okay and meat was okay. was expecting way better. not worth the wait"}
{"text":"I wanted to eat ramen after seeing it on TV the night before, without going Downtown so decided to come here. After reading the yelp reviews, I came in not expecting much though, and realized this is what happens when you're lazy and want to save on gas.  Service:(5/5)  Although the workers at the kitchen or servers don't greet you the same way as they do in the flagship location (the Japanese yelling), the service was pleasant overall. The servers were attentive and friendly. Food came in on a timely basis. I waited for 15 min to receive the appetizers, and right after I was done eating, the ramen came. Service was great considering how crowded the restaurant was!  Food: (2.5/5)  Pork Ramen Lunch Combo (before 5pm)  (~$12.99) comes with appetizer  Age Gyoza - 4 pieces of crisp pork dumplings with a  great tasting sweet-chili sauce. Delicious!!!!!!  Pork Ramen - comes with one piece of belly (half fat half meat) and shoulder, I believe, and corn, and beansprouts. One of the pieces is torched and tastes amazing, but the other piece is sub-par because it has an old fridge flavour. The miso broth is flavourful, and has garlic oil on top! Though at the bottom it's a tad too salty. I walked out of the restaurant feeling off because of the final sips, and I didn't want to revisit this location again.   Comments:  The default options lacked in terms of generosity; it had none of the following: egg, seaweed, fungi, which are ramen staples; you probably would have to pay extra for it.   Maybe it's just this location, but I feel like every year or so that I visit Kinton, the options are more scarce. This location had no customization for sodium level, pork meat type (option of shoulder or belly), or bamboo which I remember experiencing at the other Kintons before.  tl;dr - I know this location is popping and the service is great, but it's best to wait it out and save your ramen cravings for the downtown locations where the broth/meat tastes better and there are more options available"}
{"text":"Can't quite put my finger over why I prefer this over the Richmond Hill Location if I were to compare the GTA Kintons.  Perhaps the service is more efficient and friendly? I went in for the $5.18 ramen on their 6th year anniversary and i had a smooth experience. There were around 10 people by the door but with the steady flow of customers, I was able to sit down within 10 minutes and have my food placed on my table shortly after.   My go-to order is the pork miso ramen. I remember the pork having an 80% amount of fat compared to 20% meat which was a little disappointing. The rest of the ramen was standard and I would go again for the $5.18 special!"}
{"text":"I visited Kinton Ramen with two other of my coworkers for an early Friday night dinner and the three of us loved our ramen! We all opted for the original ramen with think noodles and I got a ton ton don (pork rice bowl) as well.   I was not a fan of the rice bowl at all, the pork that came with it had a flaky almost like canned tuna kind of texture, heavily lacking moisture. The flavour wasn't bad tasting like a mixture of soy sauce, sugar and mirin but it was just too dry and the flaky texture of the pork was really odd.  The ramen on the other side was very delicious, a very generous portion with a large slice of charsiu and a thick slab of pork belly. The egg was perfectly seasoned with a rich soy sauce flavour coming through despite the strong flavour of the broth. The noodles were nice and chewy. I found that addition of the beansprouts rather odd, I supposed it was for a couch texture but I would have much preferred the typically seen bamboo shoots. I found the broth, online many previous reviewers, actually quite flavourful. It was nice and thick (from the collagen in the bones?)."}
{"text":"Is it just me or has kinton ramen decreased the size of all their pork ramen??!! One bowl of ramen used to be so much food but now it's barely enough for a hungry me.  Size aside, kinton is pretty yummy but it leaves you with a salty and fatty taste in the mouth that is rather uncomfortable. Compared to other ramen places, I feel that kinton's broth only stands out because of its fattyness and not because of its umami.  All in all, not bad when you want a small bowl of hot noodle soup but if you want the real deal, I'd recommend isshin or sensotei"}
{"text":"Enjoyed a nice quiet lunch here with my mom on Christmas Eve.  I am not a ramen aficionado nor do I know what authenticity tastes like, so take this review as you wish, but I did enjoy the food.  We shared the chicken karage (think KFC fried bird but better) to start which was served with a mayo sauce. I opted for the veggie ramen, which was delicious and warming. Mom went with the pork ramen and she said it was tasty.  I would return if in the area again - ramen seems to be the perfect winter warming meal."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night for an early dinner at 6.30pm. Waited about 10 minutes for 2  seats at the bar. It's a busy area however, is highly recommended its a lot of fun to watch them prepare the noodles and be in the yelling action. You will leave smelling like food as they sear the pork so close to you.   The quality is the same as the other kintons, the portions are large. The soup I got wasn't satly as others have wrote it was perfectly fine for me. The noodles had a good texture but I do always wish they gave more meat its it's the same as all the others (just 1 slice of pork) Their gyoza and takoyaki is not bad your standard fare, could come with a bit more mayo and benito flakes. Service is quick and nice  Check out their bathroom haha they have everything in there from lotion, mouthwash after all that garlicy broth you just had and ladies they got your back in case you have a monthly emergency."}
{"text":"Currently my favorite ramen place. When it's busy the wait can be a little long. Otherwise, great food, good service. Try the jalapeño chicken ramen if you enjoy heat."}
{"text":"Loved the place. Limited to one vegetarian choice.m, however, that was very very good  Definitely recommend the Jalapeño sauce as well"}
{"text":"Been to the Toronto location and quality was consistent for both. I did enjoy the pork in toronto more, as it had a more caramelized roasted surface. Got the miso pork ramen, the thick noodles had the exact texture you want from ramen. Not soggy, just the right bounce.  However, I wished they made a tonkotsu broth. It's more time consuming and harder to perfect but any good ramen place should have it.  Also, the amount of toppings/noodle ratio was pretty good imo.  Takoyaki was not piping hot when you bite into it (big no-no) , but flavour was great. Service was fast and friendly, atmosphere was comfortable enough despite being crowded on a Friday night. Prices could be a bit lower (we did get two appetizers and dessert...) but reasonable for the food you're getting I guess.  Came for ramen, left satisfied!"}
{"text":"Date & Time of visit: Sunday, March 12, 2017 @ 6:30pm-7:20pm Atmosphere: Intimate, Stylish, Fast Paced - In & Out eatery. Cleanliness: Restaurant appeared to be clean. Cutlery, plates and glasses were clean. Constructive criticism: Comfier Bar Stools needed! Cuisine: Specialty Japanese Ramen Facilities: Did not visit the facilities. Food: My fiancé ordered the Chicken Miso, and I ordered the Pork Miso. We both added the soft boiled egg to our soups which was super delicious! The soya sauce tints the egg a light brown color, which did not look appealing, but when we tried it, it was just so damn good. We wanted to try the thin noodles over the thick since this was our first time at Kinton. The flavor of the miso was not overpowering, very creamy and delicate. The pork pieces in my Ramen were salty and fatty, which added more flavour to the soup, and I actually love the cut of pork they used.  The fiancé's chicken was tender and thinly cut. It was delicious, but I felt the pork added more flavour to the broth. We did the soup combos, so I ordered the Ton Ton Don Pork which came on rice. It had a minced appearance and a certain smoky flavour I don't care much for. My fiancé played it safe and did the Gyoza with his combo. They were very flavorful and delicious. Safe to say I would order the dumplings on our next visit. Likeliness of returning or recommending to others: This little place has become our Wednesday night go to. We look forward to our marriage class right down the street, because we know we are getting a fantastic meal, in a quick time frame. I would love to come back with a larger group of friends, but sadly this restaurant is not equipped for Saturday night girls night. (I am referring to the one on Yonge street only). We heard about Kinton on the television show \"You gotta eat here\". https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBHie0HoPNw Parking: conveniently located next to the restaurant. Sunday after 5pm, was $7.00. Portion Sizes: Satisfied. We left feeling full! Large amount of soup to warm the blood! Price: Good. 2 combos, 2 drinks, and 2 eggs (additional toppings), came out to $37.98 Service: When we arrived, we were greeted by the hostess who added our names to a waiting list. We were seated at the bar area in under 5 minutes. Our server offered suggestions since we were first timers, and it was helpful since she had preference to her recommendations. When we asked her which beers she had, she wasn't sure. I asked her about the lemonade and she didn't know if it was authentic or premade. Still friendly and quick to help. Selection: Good. The menu offered just the right amount of items. Not overwhelming, and all items looked delicious. What makes this restaurant stand out from the others: Kinton is a Ramen Bar. It has stylish interior design, and a chef that holds 10 years of experience in Ramen cuisine. Hours of Operation: Sunday- Thursday 11:30am - 10:30pm. Friday - Saturday 11:30am - 12am.

{"text":"Un restaurant de ramen des proprietaires de Guu ? Je ne pouvais manquer ca !  Ce Kinton situe en plein Korean Town propose un menu le midi qui est tres attractif (une soupe ramen + un accompagnement) Vous choississez votre viande (porc ou poulet), votre soupe et son bouillon  (legere, normale ou riche, sous entendue riche en gras), le type de nouilles (fines ou epaisses et votre type de viande (poitrine ou epaule). J'ai pris epaule de porc, nouilles epaisses, soupe miso (soja, ail, mais) et c'etait bon, pas tres genereux avec la viande cependant. La soupe peut sembler fade pour certains. J'ai preferé l'accompagnement aux ramens. L'emincé de porc et son riz était vraiment bon, bien assaisonne avec une petite touche sucree.  J'aime beaucoup la decoration quoique tout peut paraitre un peu sombre (surtout les toilettes !)"}
{"text":"The place quiet down since it's opening. The karage improved. The ramen noodles are great. Tried a April ramen special. Boy what a royal mess! Incredible.. I don't know. Anyway from the picture I took eww.  I mixed it up and yeah what a rich spicy AND delicious dish."}
{"text":"I've tried a few different things on the menu. The spicy garlic is really good. Always grab an egg and the bamboo shoots on the side.  I also had the octopus balls. They're not as good as the ones in Asia but still orderable."}
{"text":"I went to the restaurant couple times.It is on the great location.  They provide great roman with nice soup. The food is delicious with great portion size. Their employees are very friendly and willing to help. For example, they even help me to hang my coat. Also, they are so patient to introduce the menu. Therefore, I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday afternoon. Food took almost an hour to come. Ordered the pork miso soup ramen don combo- the soup was bland, the pork was tough, and the noodles were stiff.   Gave 2 stars simply because the ambience of the place is pretty nice, but don't be fooled by the decor of this place.  One of the lower end ramen shops in Markham/Toronto Area. Would advise caution."}
{"text":"I travel between Toronto and Montreal frequently.  Very glad to hear that Kinton Ramen has now landed in Montreal as well.    We started with some appetizers.  The karrage and spicy karrage were tender and crispy on the outside.  Same for the gyoza and tofu furai (fried tofu nuggets).  The tofu were shaped like McDonald's chicken McNuggets:)  My original ramen was very delicious.  The noodles were not overcooked and the broth was intensely flavoured.  My family had the spicy garlic ramen, which had great reviews from them as well.  Usually, I don't comment about the restrooms.  But it's worth commending!  The washroom was nicely interior decorated and has a wide assortment of \"spa\" amenities, like mouthwash and Q-tips.  The mouthwash is perfect after eating the spicy garlic ramen!  :)  I just started to become a Kinton bowler, which I finished the bowl to the last drop.  The servers and kitchen staff all came out, did their usual \"holler\" and took a picture of us on Instagram.  #kintonbowler  In Toronto, they have more selection in terms of appetizers and combos.  Hopefully, they will adopt those soon!  Also, what is missing in our meal was dessert! :(  Overall, quality and service are top notch!  Two thumbs up!  Oishi!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Service ====== Great! Friendly, warm and & courteous.  You get the classic all-staff greeting when you come in and an all staff farewell when you leave.  The food ========  Soup  ------ - A little on the bland side - A little on the watery side - In fact I really couldn't taste much of any flavour in the soup :(.  It's a stark difference from other Kinton places.  Noodles --------- Nice and chewy, cooked perfectly.  Toppings ---------- I had one Cha Shiu that was delicious, and a second that was bland. The egg was tasty, gooey and seasoned well.  Edamame Beans ----------------- Tasty, well seasoned, cooked perfectly.   Will I be back? =========== No... for the price there are better options in Markham for tastier ramen."}
{"text":"I have honestly been coming here everyday for the past few months for a meal. This is probably the best ramen place in Toronto. $11 for a decent bowl of pork original ramen, $3 more for a small side makes a perfect combo. There's always an egg included and two pieces of meat (pork belly and shoulder) and the atmosphere is always lively.   This location is much more spacious than the one on Baldwin, but both locations have the same great ramen at the same great price. I love the thick noodles for how chewy they are. The broth isn't too salty and perfect to my taste.   Their karaage is amazing, so be sure to come on Monday for their special karaage-ramen! Why is it only on Mondays... If they had it everyday, I would definitely have it everyday! Their chicken broth is great too, but I personally prefer the pork one. I'll definitely keep coming here."}
{"text":"I read great things about this place so I really wanted to rate it highly, however, our first impression was not a fantastic one. It took a while for someone to take our order and then we waited another half hour to get our food. I was semi-hungry when I walked in, but starving when my food finally came. Sorta worked out I guess. The waiting was not fun though, especially see other people's food arrive faster than ours. Their ramen is quite good, so I'll give it that. I only wish it came with more toppings for the base like some other places. I think our server switched halfway and the second lady was a lot efficient in serving us. The bill arrived promptly, or at least quicker than our food. I don't really see the hype over this place. May or may not be back."}
{"text":"Came here tonight with my boyfriend. It was a tiny little place and very busy tonight. It took a while for someone to acknowledge us and to seat us. When we did get a table to no one acknowledged us and we had to wait a while till someone came by to take our order. We started with the age gyoza, my boyfriend ordered the pork spicy garlic ramen and I got the pork original ramen. I asked the server if I could have the pork original as spicy and she said it would be an extra $1.50, I agreed to it since I love my food with a bit of kick. The gyozas were really good, I could eat 10 more of them. When my ramen came, I asked if it was spicy and she gave me chilli oil and basically told me that I just pour it in. I was kind of expecting that the chefs would already pre mix the chilli's in the broth. The spice level wasn't as hot as I would've liked and adding the chilli oil to mine just made my broth very greasy and became nauseating after a while. My boyfriend thought his ramen was alright but could've been a little more spicy. We both agreed that  the pork was the highlight as it was  very tender. We had to wait a while again to get our bill, I think they were very short staffed as service on a whole was very slow. Overall, I've had better ramen at aji sen and I wouldn't come back here."}
{"text":"The ramen here is not bad. My sister-in-law and i ordered the extra pork ramen (basically a meat lover's) with extra noodles ($1.9 extra) and corn (+$1) in spicy broth to share with a side of ebi mayo. Splitting a bowl of ramen with extra noodles is more bang for your buck. I basically got 2 bowls of ramen for about 9.50 per person.  The noodles were chewy and the broth was flavorful. The small ball of garlic intensifies the flavor of the broth when you mix it into the soup. For some reason they only torched 2 slices of the pork and not all 4. The chashu tastes better with some flame applied directly to it. The ebi mayo was just ok. They give you some iceberg lettuce and 2 shrimp chips on the side as garnish."}
{"text":"I don't want to show everyone on yelp how fussy i am, but i was slightly disappointed that my chasu wasn't torched like the Richmond Hill location. I like that subtle char to the chasu because i think it adds more oomph to my meat. First world problem aside, i never tried their egg but when my friend bit into his, it was more well done (but not yet hard boiled) than most ramen places i have been to in the GTA.  I do however love their spicy garlic broth. That perfect heaping spoon of garlic and the heat from the soup makes the ramen so flavorful.  I also tried their spicy karaage appetizer and it wasn't very spicy to me. It was more vinegary than it was spicy if that is your thing. For $6 I didn't think the appetizer was worth it.  If i come back again i will try their black sesame pudding dessert. It sounds silky and delicious."}
{"text":"Tried to visit this place a couple of times Friday evening and could not be bother with the wait.  Finally  went on a weekday evening and got a seat.  Tried the original chicken for the first time. I liked it,  the broth tasted great and the chicken was really tender but only two pieces so precious.  I would eat this again.  The fried chicken was nothing special a bit pricey at $8.30"}
{"text":"Decent ramen, clean bathrooms, ladies bathroom has complimentary feminine hygiene pads, great service"}
{"text":"Noticed this new location so tried it out while in the area. Nice interior, friendly but inexperienced staff and food is on par with the other locations. But why the loud and endless loop of industrial garage band music? And midway through the meal, they cranked it up another notch. So I obliged by leaving without finishing all the noodle, and one fewer star."}
{"text":"This Kinton Ramen branch stays true to the brand. The dishes were pretty much standard ramen dishes you can find all across Toronto. Nothing incredibly special, but always consistent with the flavour and portioning of their bowls. I'll be back if I'm in the area and craving ramen. We got the chicken miso and the pork with soy bean paste. For sides we got a small chicken and rice dish with mayo and gyozas (which were sooo good, the sweet mayo sauce they top the dumplings with really stood out). Unfortunately, the homemade hot sauce was unremarkable - it lacked both flavour and spice. I think that was the biggest disappointment of the meal, partly because to have hot sauce on the side they charge $1.50, which is fine if it did the job . I do the love the way they greet and thank every customer that walks in lol ."}
{"text":"Got the pork ramen with chicken breast, light broth, thick noodles (specially requested to be more al dente than usual), and grated garlic.   Chicken the most tender I've ever had, but a little too salty. Overall broth is a little too salty. Egg was perfectly creamy.   Homemade lemonade not that great. Wouldn't get it next time."}
{"text":"Loving all these ramen joints in Toronto! One of my goals is to try all the ramens in this city. Although I had many bowls of ramen in Japan, Korea, and Canada, I still don't have a clear idea of how to rate them. They are all different. It all comes down to personal preference....  When I saw chicken ramen on the menu, I had to give it a try because I love trying unique dishes (same reason for trying tomato ramen at Sansotei :P).  It was very flavourful! Noodles were cooked on point. I also tried their pork ramen (my bf's order) which was also flavourful and rich. We sat at the bar where you can see chefs preparing ramen. Quick and friendly service like any other Japanese ramen places!  Overall, it was not the best ramen I had, but certainly solid food. The biggest pro for Kinton Ramen is that they have several locations throughout the city, so no need to line up or travel far to taste their ramen. I don't know if there is a huge difference between different locations (apparently Sansotei locations do have a huge difference, downtown one being better than the one in uptown). If you don't want to line up for Sansotei or Santouka, come here!"}
{"text":"I have tried many many ramen places in almost every city that I've been, given they've had a ramen restaurant. Although my absolute favorite after all the places (including Japan) is in Cambridge Massachusetts, i must say Kinton has been my second favorite. They are definitely the best in Toronto i think. We are lucky that we live very close to this one around Eglinton area so for the past few months, having ramen at Kinton has been a regular ritual of my wife and I. I specially like their pork Miso ramen but do like the other options in the menu. I have never tried their chicken options though. We tried the Gyoza also and liked it very much. I love the choice of thick ramen and their spicy jalapeño sauce although they charge for it. I think it should be free. The staff are very friendly and welcoming and the service is great.   Food: 4.5/5 Price: 3.5/5 Service and atmosphere: 4.5/5  Overall: 4.5/5"}
{"text":"We tried the spicy pork and the original pork ramen. We both got the thick noodles. Definitely liked the ramen. The spicy broth definitely had a good kick. Liked the fact that we had different toppings options. The place is designed nicely and trendy and the staff were friendly. Would definitely go there again as my wife and I just can't get enough ramen ever.  Food: 4.5/5 Price: 4.5/5 Atmosphere and staff: 4.5/5 Overall: 4.5/5"}
{"text":"This is my first time going to this ramen joint recommended by my friend :)   I thought the Ramen had there was pretty delicious and flavourful and pretty reasonably priced!  The only thing that took off a star was pretty much the location because the place is located in a sketchy area where a bunch of junkies and homeless people hang around so you probably want to be careful walking to this restaurant from the street car or wherever you are with caution because you never know who's going to walk up to you there! but other than that the place and the restaurant itself was very good the staff was friendly and the atmosphere was great!  I would definitely come here again but definitely during the daytime :)"}
{"text":"I've never been too crazy about Ramen. I live Gluten free, so anything threatening my gut is on the red list. But for this place, it's worth it to take that Gluten-Ease pill. seriously delicious. flavourful, buttery (I got it with extra butter), the noodles perfectly cooked and the meat perfectly tender and flavourful. I wish I lived closer to Montréal for this one restaurant."}
{"text":"I was around the area and decided to give this place a try. Was a little skeptical because I have heard and read many reviews saying their service was absolute trash BUT I was pleasantly surprised by how wrong those reviews were. I felt the service was actually pretty good. One of the servers was a bit awkward like he was straight up just awkward, but the other server was BOMB. LIKE I DO NOT KNOW YOUR NAME BUT YOU DESERVE A SHOUTOUT (the tattooed lad was absolutely rad). He was so nice, cool, and chill like THAT IS ALL I EVER ASK FOR. Bless his soul like damn ~   Initially, I wanted to try one of their specials (forgot the name), but it was a limited item so of course my late ass didn't get to try it but it is OKAY. Instead, I got the spicy pork ramen with the thick noodles. I also got takoyaki balls. The takoyaki was generally pretty good. Tastes like the standard. I just kind of wish the balls were bigger? I think it only came with 4 small balls for like $5.50 and I don't really think it's worth it? It's like a dollar per ball LOL. Anyways the ramen was.. okay. I don't LOVE it to be honest. I have had way better. The broth here was actually quite thick which was a totally new world for me and I'm not quite sure I like it. Flavour is good but the thickness just throws me off way too much. Oh and, oh my fucking god, they added this like garlic and ginger root paste? and it was disgusting. I literally went into this ramen place as a human and I walked out as a piece of garlic. LOOOL LIKE I STANK. MY BREATH WAS UNBEARABLE IM SORRY TO WHOEVER SAT NEXT TO ME ON THE BUS BUT OH MY LORD. NEVER AGAIN. I WILL REMOVE THAT SHIT NEXT TIME I COME (if there even is a next time that is ;D)   I wanted to mention this but I hate their chairs. There is no back side so you either hang your jacket elsewhere (there is a designated area for that), or you keep it on. I just chose to wear my jacket. But man, I like having a back side to REST MY back and just lean yall feel me? I literally almost fell to my death because I forgot there was no back side to the chair .............. like .........who knew eating ramen could be so dangerous rawr"}
{"text":"I like here! The price is reasonable. A combo, you get a Ramen and an appetizer for 12.99 or 13.99. I ordered the fired dumping. That was delicious! And the best thing of the Ramen is that they gave the whole Egg! It's not normal boiled egg, but Japanese soft boiled egg."}
{"text":"Maybe I set my standards a little too high after having Kinton Ramen at the downtown location, but the ramen here was ok and the soup just taste like any other soup base with MSG. Nothing special, they get customers from their brand name, and prices are decent, so if I'm in the area, don't know what to eat, and don't want to spend a fortune, I might go here."}
{"text":"Good ramen but have had better. Price is also on the steep side for what you get compared to other ramen places. Would go back of I were in the area."}

{"text":"Had the original pork Ramen with pork belly and thick noodles. Was pretty darn good. Broth has decent pork flavour without being too oily. noodles were firm (which I like) but everyone has a different preference. I will say one thing. The egg was PERFECT. Great flavour, and cooked (partially cooked that is) perfectly. I could do without the pork belly I think I prefer the shoulder - its just more substantial IMHO. But a pretty good Ramen for sure. To me I think I prefer the Tonkotsu black ramen at Sansotei...but not by much."}
{"text":"Love this place. I like the limited choices they have on their menu and the ambience is so good to have a casual lunch if you ever dont know where to go. Chicken with miso never goes wrong. Dont forget to try the karage its super amazing."}
{"text":"My Kinton Ramen frequent bowler card is filling up. My regular ramen bowl is: -Pork Broth -Shoyu Flavour -Thick Noodle -Extra Pork Shoulder and a Hogtown Brewery Beer.  Love it!   Hot, Spicy, Salty, Filling!"}
{"text":"Definitely loving the new ramen option in the west end! We made a visit just before 6pm and it was maybe just a 20mins wait. So glad the line moved pretty quickly and we ordered not long after being seated. I have to note that we did wait a pretty long time for 5 bowls of ramen when it would take maybe 10mins usually. It took like 25 to 30 mins...definitely longer than what I was hoping. Great thing the noodles were satisfying and yummy! I got the original pork ramen while my husband got the miso chicken. It was my first time ever at Kinton so I did not know that they served a chicken option. This is a nice selection since there is another option for people who do not eat red meat or looking for a lighter flavor. I enjoyed my original pork with thick noodles. The ramen came with an egg, nori, green onions and corn. To add corn was an extra $1 and I did get a generous serving. The one thing I noticed was my broth could have been hotter as I could see the pork fat and oils coming together...this was probably because they were preparing all 5 bowls at the same time and mine was one of the first ones. Although, service was slow, the ramen was yummy and I satisfied by ramen craving! I would definitely come back again especially since it was only the day after their grand opening so I'm sure it won't always be such slow service:)"}
{"text":"Pretty decent but I don't think I'd come back. Wasn't a huge fan of the flavours personally. But maybe I just ordered the wrong item.   There are better options for ramen in Toronto. But I will say the noodles were tasty. It wasn't horrible just not my favourite ."}
{"text":"Kinton was the first restaurant that I dine at while I'm here in Toronto for a few days. I noticed that there was a wait for a seat since it was a tiny shop. There were about 10 seats and a bar seating.   They all were very energetic and fast-paced. We were a party of four and we seat in between two other party. They were enjoying their lovely meal. I enjoy the face that we were able to chat with the people next to us. It allows people to have the chance to meet others. The seating were a bit uncomfortable for me, since it was made out of wood and the seat was quite smaller than the rest of the chairs...   I ordered the Shoyu Chicken Ramen with thick noodles and additional chicken breast strips. Added the corn topping. I should've added bean sprouts and nori... I thought that this dish was very salty. I drank a lot of water afterwards but it was really tasty. I enjoyed the chicken strip. It was really tender and flavorful. I was also able to try the Pork Ramen but i thought it was really really really greasy. My uncle was not able to finish it since there was a layer of oil sitting on top of it.   The staff also yells when we enter or leave the premises. I'm not sure if the customers would enjoy that but it scared me a bit since it was the first time, I've been here.  I would definitely come here again to try out the different items on the menu if I lived in Toronto!"}
{"text":"If I want good quality ramen, I come here with anyone who am with. They serve a good bowl of my favourite spicy garlic ramen and a side kaarage.    The only annoying side to this location is that women with big ass purses (or whatever size) will have no choice but to clutch onto it or set it on the floor because everyone sits on a high stool side by side. And mind your dress when you have to climb up and sit. JUST SAYING.  Overall, I recommend this place! Have a go at it for once!"}
{"text":"Their ramen, fried chicken, and takoyaki are delicious.   They could improve by offering larger seating (stools are about a foot, table is like 3 feet)."}
{"text":"Small restaurant with lineups. I was lucky to come at a time where I only waited 5 minutes. I guess to beat the crowd, it's best to come right when they open or around 2pm. I ordered rich pork shoulder thick noodles with corn and I was pretty happy with how it tasted. Super filling but the broth may have been too rich for my tastes (too fatty). It was my first time having 'authentic' Japanese ramen and I'm happy with my experience.   I sat at the bar by the the door which wasn't exactly the best spot but it was definitely worth it for the ramen. Personally, I found the broth to be a slight salty but it was totally different from the MSG package ramen taste (much better ofc). I also ordered the takoyaki which was abit soggy but tasted fine. I'd love to come back to try anything ramen!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyable.  I'm actually the type to appreciate a quieter place with a laid back atmosphere.  Just the opposite of Kinton Ramen!  It's strange, though--I walked into this crazy, busy place and loved it right away.  Maybe it reminded me of my two trips to Japan.  Great, fun atmosphere and the food is wonderful.  Gyoza probably the best I've ever had.  I had the shoyu ramen and it was amazing.  Delicious broth.  I sampled some of the garlic spicy ramen as well and that was a bit too strong for my taste (and I love garlic--the more garlicky the better).  Super friendly service.  I can appreciate the reviewers here who were frustrated because of the wait.  Fortunately with only two of us, we got right in.  I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I will give 3.8/5 for this place. -0.2 because their broth has bit less flavour than other ramen places, and amount of space. This place is really small and tight, and because of the concept of restaurant, it gets really loud so do not expect any kind of comfort. Also get there as early as possible. It gets really busy and you will end up on waiting list if you get there after 7pm.  However, I still love to visit here because of their noodle. Their noodle is probably the one of best in Toronto. It's fresh and perfectly cooked. Every ramen is good but if I have to recommend any, try their spicy ramen or cheese ramen. You will probably give me a squinty eyes right now but their swiss cheese ramen is quite interesting. It's surprisingly delicious and you will be impress with the amount of cheese they put on the top of your ramen. Their chicken is also good. Its hot, crispy and juicy. Their Gyoza is nothing more than just average tho. Servers are really nice and their drinks are pretty good.   I have been to Santosei, Santouku, and Kenzo, and Kinton is definitely on the top of list. Been there 5 times and will definitely visit again."}
{"text":"Read as 3.5  Came here on a Friday night and not surprisingly, it was packed. We were really lucky to get two seats right in front of the \"kitchen area\" though, and we got to see all their cooking literally right in front of our eyes!  We each had a ramen and the noodles/toppings were all very delicious.  My main issue was that the soup base/broth was more salty than I would have liked.  Service was good overall, and for such a busy night, I was impressed with how quickly everything got accomplished honestly.  The atmosphere can get a bit hectic and crazy at times though, the restaurant itself gets fairly warm inside too, and you're squished into such a small space with barely any room for coats/personal belongings at any rate.  Overall, I'd come back here for the food, but I'd be more inclined to check out nearby places first."}
{"text":"I think I lucked out with a seat. I thought about inviting a friend to come, but doing so might have prevented me from getting a seat. So I walked in, table for 1. And I got a seat right away!  It wasn't so noisy but just enough buzz inside to hear those around you. But the feature, I had Shio Ramen. Salt based broth, it was soo good as the flavor was just so rich. The pork shoulder had this smoky flavor that was so nice. And the noodles I think were the best, cooked just enough that it was chewy.  For one bowl of noodles yes it is expensive. If I had to wait it would not have been worth it. But my experience itself was a 4!"}
{"text":"Kinton is highly HIGHLY overrated. Their broth is super salty; I just remember it tasting super artificial. The noodles and chicken meat I had with it were also very mediocre as it was soaked in the extra salty broth. They also play their music super loud that my friend and I had to almost shout over one another. There are TONS of really great ramen places in Toronto to explore and salivate over, this is not one of them."}
{"text":"A recommended visit. Yum!  The restaurant is on the smaller side and not recommended for larger parties.   My girlfriend and I have been here several times since Richmond Hill & Vaughan don't seem to have as many good ramen spots.  Kinton is our local go-to for a consistent, budget comfort food. Ingredients are always fresh, servers are always around and helpful, and the food is pretty fast.   The Miso Ramen or Spicy Garlic ramen are both excellent -- recommend the pork over chicken - the pork belly and shoulder slices are very tender and flavourful. Add a pint of Sapporo for under $4 and you're leaving happy.   The 10 complimentary gyoza we received for our 10th visit were great too. They were hot, crispy and fresh with a tasty sauce and salad garnish.    Check this spot out on Mondays for the Karaage Ramen. The Karaage chicken here are killer good - always hot, juicy, fresh and crispy but tend to take a little longer to prepare."}
{"text":"Visited Kinton Ramen tonight for the soft opening. I ordered the Shoyu regular with pork belly, my wife the Miso light with pork shoulder. To drink we went for the yuzu lemonade and a calpico soda (liquor license is coming soon).  The Shoyu ramen was very delicious. The pork belly was tender and the outer edge had a smokey almost sweet aroma. The noodles were fresh and had a nice bite. The broth was rich with bits of goodness floating around. And the Shoyu ramen came with a perfectly cooked egg, runny in the center. The chopped fresh red onions might not tickle everyone's fancy (my wife picked them out of her bowl), but I didn't mind the contrast to the deep broth. Amazingly for such hearty fare, I didn't feel at all weighed down during or after dinner.  The Miso ramen was tasty, but I preferred the Shoyu. I'd also recommend the pork belly over the shoulder (which is probably as fatty, but doesn't provide the same melt in your mouth mmm).  Kinton was designed by the same architect behind Guu, I'm a fan of his modern style it really sets the mood. We sat at the communal table in the back, which is tight but comfortable enough. The price point is very affordable, dinner for two ran just $28 including tax. Kinton is a welcome addition to Baldwin street and a definite contender for the best ramen in Toronto. We'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"Came here a few weeks ago for lunch. We ordered gyoza,  takoyaki, spicy garlic ramen with pork shoulder and shoyu ramen with pork shoulder and extra egg. I was not impressed. The soup base tasted bland, egg was overcooked, pork shoulder tasted burnt and very tough. The gyoza and takoyaki were the only dishes I enjoyed here. I have been to the Baldwin location and that one was much better."}
{"text":"Damn this place has good ramen. Got the Shoyu pork ramen and the pork shoulders were really good, as well as the broth. Definitely beats Kenzo's, and the ramen comes out warm too.  Really loud atmosphere with friendly service too."}
{"text":"OVERALL: Kinto Ramen probably offers the best ramen noodles in Toronto, but the quality of the food in itself is not very impressive.  PLACE: This is a restaurant you want to visit with one or two friends, not with a large group. The entire place seats about 30, most of those seats are bar stools facing the kitchen. If you come with a large group you will have to wait a long, long time for one of the two larger tables (one of which is standing-only). The place is designed in a similar way to the Guu restaurants: clean design, natural wood with steel accents against a very dark palette, clever use of pointed light fixtures.  FOOD: The place specializes in Ramen noodles based on pork meat (belly/shoulder), so that's the basis of the menu (it does have one vegetarian main option). The meat was well-prepared, the noodles had just the right amount of firmness. Between the four of us I got to try three different broth versions, including one distinguished by sea salt, one by soy, and one by a spicy broth. My soup had a seasoned egg that was perfectly soft-boiled. My biggest complaint, and a major reason why I am giving it three stars, is that the broths were all heavily OVER-SALTED.  I am picky about salt levels, and specifically asked the server to bring me the least salty of the broth options. The broth was still extremely salty -- any more and I wouldn't be able to finish the bowl. I kept silent about this, but my dinner companions made the same remarks about their dishes. When I tried someone else's broth (the one defined by sea salt) it really tasted like sea water, and it would have been inedible to me. Proper salt levels is one of the basic criteria for a great broth, and this brought the place down to \"just decent\" for me. I should note that all our bowls had the \"regular\" broth option, so perhaps the \"light\" option has better salt levels.   Two more personal taste comments on the food: 1. I had an issue with the large pieces of raw scallion in the soup, which gave you a crunchy taste of red onion in the middle of a bite, and did not complement the otherwise smartly designed dish.  2. The \"regular\" broth comes with a ton of crushed garlic, and another heap of garlic on top. If you don't want a very heavy garlic taste, you might ask for the heap of garlic to come on the side.   SERVICE: Since every opening restaurant has some kinks to work out in terms of service and order turnaround, I won't comment on the excusable service snags that occurred during our meal, and I recommend having some patience in this regard."}
{"text":"From the makers of Guu, comes this Baldwin Village noodle bar.  Even at the lunch hours the sizable crowd huddling outside like flies speaks volumes about the popularity of Kinton. But you can greatly boost of not waiting long if you're just dining alone or with one other person--I was given a bar seat within minutes of showing up.  All the staff greet you with loud Japanese enthusiasm as you walk in, as if the place isn't loud and lively enough. Small, long and narrow, the interior is cramped, but is decked out with wooden tones, including the neat walls composed of stacked blocks of 4x4s cut at various angles. The air reeks of pork bone broth.  I enjoyed the spicy garlic ramen, which was lightly spicy, had a good noticeable hint of garlic, and anchored with a tender fatty slab of pork belly. Just fine. Two guys next to me were busy snapping pics of their bowls, gyoza and other orders. And oh, they finished their bowl, broth and all, which apparently unlocks then entry to the \"Kinton Bowlers\" club. It's a promo scheme where they'll take a picture of you and post it on their Facebook page. Do this enough times and you could win giveaways. I had no idea. Quick, start slurping!  Kinton makes a big effort to make their eatery a crazy lively energetic experience, much like what I heard about Guu. Unfortunately when I left, a group that I recognized from when I arrived were still waiting outside for a table. Suckers. Goes to show: don't bring a large group here.  {TTC: a short walk from where the Dundas streetcar stops at McCaul St.}"}
{"text":"Funny story! We were visiting Toronto and were actually intending to go to the 'other' Japanese restaurant next door but mistakenly walked into Kinto by mistake (I'm sure it happens all of the time). Upon realizing that we were in a ramen place instead of a sushi place, we opted to stay. We did not regret this decision. We even came back once more before heading home.  Seriously, I think Kinto has spoiled my expectations for ramen. There are a lot of ramen places in NYC - a lot of very good ones at that. But Kinto raised the bar. The spicy pork with extra pork and egg is my go-to. Delicious and perfectly fiery without the cold spice ball that most just add on top. Also good were the regular and spicy kara-ages and the nice, cold Sapporo drafts. Yummy indeed.  We'll be sure to stop in again the next time we're in Toronto. I'm excited to try other dishes on the menu."}
{"text":"I've been following their Instagram for a little while and I was so excited when I heard Kinton is opening a restaurant in Montreal! I've always wanted to try their ramen but I've always missed my chances when they were offering it for a limited time at Kinka Izakaya.  We went there a week after they were opened but we didn't have to wait at all as we went there fairly late (~8:30 pm). The restaurant is quite spacious but it was really hot inside (it felt like you suddenly enter into a heated room/sauna...)   Kinton Ramen offers two broths: tonkotsu (pork-based) and chicken-based brothes. Their regular sized ramens are all the same price ($12.99, except for their vegetarian ramens, which are $11.99). They have 4 different flavors: original, shoyu, miso and spicy.  Since it was my first time there, I asked our waitress which one is the most popular and which one is the less salty ramen. She told me the original flavor (sea salt) is the most popular one but the miso (soybean paste) and spicy (chilly pepper) ramens are also quite popular. She added if I'm scared that the ramen would be too salty, they can always dilute the broth for me.  After debating between their original and miso ramen, I decided to order their original tonkotsu ramen with thin noodles (I didn't ask to dilute my broth as I wanted to try the original one first). My boyfriend ordered their spicy tonkotsu ramen with thick noodles (whenever there is a spicy option, he would  always get that)!  We wanted to order their karaage but we ate lunch too late and weren't that hungry, so we passed their karaage (but the next time I go, I will try that!). We wanted to order their \"panache\" (sapporo + homemade lemonade) but they only had the \"Shandy Gaff\" (sapporo+ginger ale) left, so we ordered that.  My original ramen came with bean sprouts, nori (seaweed), scallions, seasoned soft-boiled egg and 2 pieces of char-siu (one is leaner and the other one has more fat -pork belly). My boyfriend's ramen came with bean sprouts, scallions, grated garlic and 2 pieces of char-siu. The seasoned egg inside his ramen was an extra topping.  I wished all of their ramens could come with their seasoned egg (only the original has it) as it is the best ramen-egg I've had in Montreal! The soft boiled egg was made to perfection; well marinated and the yolk was not over cooked! I also wished the ramen would come with menma (bamboo shoots) and fungus, which would add more texture to the ramen and make it tastier!  The original ramen broth was not as salty as I thought and I was really glad I didn't dilute it. The broth was actually quite thick but in a good sense; it was \"creamy\". My noodles were chewy and not too soft/over-cooked (just like the way I like). I find there weren't a big difference between the thick and the thin noodles. I stole half of my boyfriend's grated garlic and put it into my ramen. It made my broth even more yummy! I highly recommend adding the grated garlic as an additional topping or just go with someone who would order their spicy ramen (and steal some grated garlic!) I tried the spicy ramen and it was a little bit spicier than what I have expected. Overall, the ramens were delicious and we found they went really well with the sapporo beer (drinking it alone was \"meeh\" but together with the ramen, it was \"wow\")  I think they now rank as my #1 favourite ramen place in Montreal (but no ramen places in Montreal can beat Ippudo or Ichiran ramen in my opinion)"}
{"text":"Pretty delicious Ramen! Tried out the miso pork Ramen with extra noodle and found it to be the right portion of filling. Staff were friendly and the ambience is nice. One thing to note would be the price - it was a bit more than I was used to in Toronto."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Kinton. I've been to two of their locations, the original on Baldwin and the North York spot and was never disappointed there. I was excited for KR5 because it was close enough to work to go for lunch. Unfortunately, I was disappointed. My usual order, a pork shoyu ramen, was full of so much garlic that it was hard to eat and the pork shoulder, usually quite tender, was tough. At least the garlic cleared out my sinuses. I'm hoping that this was a hiccup, considering this location is still getting on its feet, but it wasn't a great experience all the same."}
{"text":"It perplexes me why this place is getting 4.5/5???? First off, a huge warning to everyone.  My friends and I all got food poisoning from here, either from the soup or the spicy chicken karrage.  As for the noodles themselves, ramen should have a solid soup base teaming with a robust pork flavour.  Kinton has none of that.  The shio soup base (I ordered the rich soup base anticipating strong pork flavour) tasted of salt with a mere hint (and that's already being generous) of pork.  It was the worst ramen soup base ever.  The miso didn't fare any better.  It tasted like miso paste with more salt.  Give me a break people.  Stop buying into the hype and ignoring your taste buds. This is definitely one of those places where the child (i.e. Kinton) is living off of the much deserved fame of the parent (i.e. Guu).  This place makes me want to give all my previous 1 star ratings another star - that's how bad it was."}
{"text":"Kinton Ramen is the newest addition to the Guu empire in Toronto. As a fan of both Guu and ramen, I was definitely looking forward tasting Guu's take on the traditional Japanese comfort food.  Our wait for a table of 3 was about 45 minutes (during soft opening week) and I bet that it's only gotten worse since then due to rather paltry selection of ramen choices in downtown Toronto's (as compared to some other major NA cities with large Asian populations aka NYC, LA, or Vancouver).  I ordered the 'extra meat' version of the tonkotsu broth ramen and it is truly an understatement to say that this was too much meat. Of course that isn't Kinton's fault and kudos to them for being extra generous. My extra meat ramen came with pork shoulder and pork belly and as usual, the belly was a lot better than the shoulder.  In comparison to the meat, I felt the amount of noodles was a bit small. Again, this wouldn't be an issue in the regular size ramen but I felt there was too much meat to noodles in the extra meat version (I guess that's why it's called extra meat and not extra large).  In terms of the broth, I have to say that it was pretty disappointing. My tonkotsu broth was regular (as opposed to light) and had fat chunks floating around which might be off-putting to some but was fine with me. However, the broth seemed to lacked a complexity that other top notch chains (i.e. Ippudo) serve. It was so salty that I believe that overpowered all other tastes in the broth.  I would definitely try Kinton again just to give it another chance. After all, this was a soft opening and ramen selection downtown just isn't that great."}
{"text":"I had a great seat in the house - right in front of all the noodle/meal makers.  I don't understand what they are saying when they seem so cheerful speaking in Japanese (I assume) - hopefully, it's not \"I hate all these people who make me sweat while they eat our noodles!\"    I've been to a few ramen places lately - gone on quite a ramen kick.  It's a bit embarrassing.  But I have to say that Kinton's pork belly was really the best I have tried so far. I also like that they can do your noodles al dente (hard) which I liked quite a lot.  If you are looking to sit and socialize, this isn't the place for you as the seats are quite close together and the vibe is hopping enough that romantic or deep conversation might be difficult!   Writing this review makes me want to go back.  Yum!"}
{"text":"I like the ramen here a lot. I would love to come more often but the service is prohibitively poor. I've come for lunch and ended up leaving the table. Cause no waiter ever came to take out order. Too bad."}
{"text":"Are you looking for ramen in a deliciously smooth, creamy and complex broth, cooked al dente, with marvelous fatty marbled slabs of pork charsiu? This is it. This is the place. You can stop swiping around on the yelp map. I have nothing more to say. Come here. Eat ramen. I came at 1:30pm on a weekday and there was no wait."}
{"text":"Amazing ramen place!   First thing, the service was amazing! We were greeted with the usual Japanese izakaya greeting! The waitress assigned us to a table and we asked to change for another place and she gladly let us. The restaurant wasn't extremely busy at that time on a Sunday night. She asked us if it is our first time here and explained the entire menu to us.   Second thing, the menu was simple. One long sheet, one side was the ramen choice and the second one has other ramen, appetisers and drinks. We had the original pork and the spicy pork. The meat was so tender! I liked it. Oh, you could also choose from thick noodles or thin noodles. The spicy one was not extremely spicy but it is still very good! The original was really good though! I would take it again but next time, I'm going to try the miso one.   On the spicy pork one, there was also a garlic ball on the middle. The original pork has nori. Basically, depending on the meat and the soup type, you have different toppings. So a spicy chicken would be totally different from the spicy pork.   Highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Tako wasabi came with 4 slices of seaweed, no way that was enough for the amount of tako wasabi given. I requested for extra seaweed but was notified of an extra charge.   I ordered the Pork Original and I wasn't sure if it's just this location, but the quantity seems very small (went during lunch). I've been to the restaurant on Yonge (during dinner time) but their portion was much more filling.  Service was quick."}
{"text":"I ordered a regular chicken ramen and was kinda underwhelmed by what I got. Aesthetically the ramen looked really nice but I got tired of the flavours really quickly. After you finish eating the seaweed, egg and chicken pieces you're left with a giant bowl of just noodles and broth. The noodles get kinda annoying after a while, in terms of the texture ((and lack of flavour)) and after having several spoonfuls of broth I was tired of that salty flavour too.   TLDR; Try this place if you want to experience ramen but it's not that great"}
{"text":"One of the better Ramen restaurants in Toronto. If you come for dinner, make sure to come earlier because it gets really packed and you will end up waiting in line for quite some time. Smaller parties are easier to get a table as they don't have a lot of sittings for more than groups of 3. That being said, the wait is definitely worth it. The brothe for the ramen is delicious and you must get the egg with it. You have the option to go light, medium or heavy on the brothes. You can also choose a chicken or pork base brothe to go with your chicken or pork ramen. I personally preferred my pork ramen dish spicier and they definitely added some heat to the dish. If you finish your entire dish, then you get a nice stamp. The more stamps you receive, the better rewards you end up getting which is pretty cool. I probably shouldn't have ordered the spicy ramen if I was going to get the stamp but it was well worth it in the end. I'll be coming back."}
{"text":"This location is not as good as North York location. The ramen broth taste artificial. I ordered pork shoulder, it tastes strong unpleasant piggy flavour and chewy, can't really eat it. Chicken karaage tastes good, but not too much flavour. Price is quiet high, music is noisy and we need to yelling to each other."}
{"text":"Pretty small restaurant. Good service but we went after peak lunch hours (1pm). Got the Pork Spicy Garlic with thin noodles and it was ok - average and certainly didn't blow me away.   Too much garlic in my opinion, but the dish does have the term \"garlic\" in it and it's not mixed in to the soup so you could choose to remove some of it! Also this dish only gave 2 pieces of meat and no egg :(   The chain has good reviews so maybe I'll try another dish next time."}
{"text":"Great and reasonably-priced customization options to get exactly what you want in your ramen here! It's thanks to this medley of choices that I was able to discover that I don't recommend butter in ramen (and really, what does dairy think it's doing in Japanese cuisine anyway?). Though if you really need to turn the richness of your ramen up to 11, by all means, be my guest and add that butter.   We got the vegetarian ramen here, which includes vegetables (bean sprouts, corn, green onion, seaweed) and tofu furai, or tofu fried nuggets (protip: eat these first before the broth makes them too soggy). Both the omnivore and vegetarian options come with plenty of veg and the price is definitely right, with the vege option being cheaper. I also got grated garlic (unfortunately extra [?!]), which really put some oomph in the flavour. My only regret was filling up on the appetizers and sake so much that I couldn't finish the broth, which was pretty rich!  Appetizer-wise, the tofu furai (which also comes as an appi with dipping sauce) was a real treat, and I say this as someone who is hard to please when it comes to tofu. The texture is really on point and the dipping sauce is tasty. Hot edamame to start really hit the spot for the hangry feelings when we first arrived! We also finished with the matcha cheesecake and that was divine despite my stomach already being waddling-level full.  Decor-wise, I was a fan of the cool ambiance and hall-style seating at long tables. There's a definite trendy/hipster vibe, so take that as a pro or con as you will."}
{"text":"This is definitely my favorite ramen place in Montreal, how would you refuse a delicious bowl of noddles in broth with either chicken/porc? No offence to any vegetarians. We may all agree in winter time, it's like offering someone a hug which was prepapred with love :'D  The place is hidden in downtown by Bishop's street. Nicely decorated in wood, helpful staff (young and efficient) make this place really welcoming.  Menu is short and simple, it's not a Da Vinci code where you'll think forever to pick whichever you want. I haven't tried everything but so far all items are delicious and prices are really good."}
{"text":"To end the night with a few bites we stopped in here.  Located on the 2nd floor, this small place does pack quite a punch.  Their chairs are actually stools but have a cutout at the bottom where you can slide your purse right in - genius!   They have daily specials and since we were here on a Sunday it was their premium night specials.  The table ordered a few different items- horse meat sashimi, beef carpaccio, chicken skewers and some sort of burger (name I have forgotten).  These dishes are more tapas style than a full meal.  I had the skewers and the beef carpaccio.  They were good but after eating at Nana's earlier in the day...well it just can't compete.  The beef wasn't sliced as thin as carpaccio should be and was a bit tough for me.  The service was polite but they forgot to bring a few people's green tea and we had to ask twice.  It wasn't crowded but it was late Sunday night so maybe this is normal so we ordered and our food came out pretty fast.      The ambiance is nice and clean - try finding the doors to the washrooms!  And actually I need to mention the washrooms because honestly they were amazing - clean and so beautiful (yeah strange to say a bathroom was beautiful but check it out and you will see why!)  Daily specials and cheap beer specials I am sure keep this place full."}
{"text":"My cousin and I are big noodle fans and tonight we stopped in here.  It's loud and rambunctious, and a lot of fun.  We had a great time catching up.  The noodles are interesting.  You pick the type you want, and if you want it light, regular or some other consistency.   The gyoza appetizer was also delish.  My cousin has a spicy garlic which she says was delish!  It was great, and I think the best ramen I've had so far in the city...(Oh ya, I said it). Will be back."}
{"text":"It was just ok. I think Santouka and Momofoku have better ramens. The layout of the restaurant is a bit weird. Overall it was a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"Kinto Ramen is a Ramen restaurant located on Bloor street.  The restaurant does have a ramp to enter the premises, however seating is VERY tight. The bathrooms, which are gendered, are down a set of stairs.  The menu is anchored in meat broth based soups.  Though there are vegetarian options, I wouldn't bring a vegetarian or vegan here.  The service was INCREDIBLE!  The people working there were super friendly and super quick.  The restaurant itself is a little loud, but that's to be expected, especially if visiting on a weekend.  I ordered the Jalapeno Ramen and an alcoholic drink with whiskey.  BOTH WERE AMAZING!   The broth was creamy, filing and tantalizing.  The combination of the boiling hot soup and the cold drink made it felt like I was at one of those spas where you run into the hot tub and then the cold tub.  Please note that the cocktails are served in beer steins.    My \"complaint\" was that I was too full to do anything else later that evening.  I wish there were more vegetarian options than just a Vegetable Ramen and a salad, but I'm not going to expect a restaurant to change for me."}
{"text":"It has been a while not having ramen. As a friend suggested, we arrived at this place. The waitresses properly welcomed us and put us on the waiting list. It didn't get us wait for too long for a table. We ordered Pork Original, Pork Shoyo and Pork Spicy Garlic. Besides them, we also got the Salmon Tataki with the Matcha Cheesecake as dessert.   The Salmon Tataki was served very quick. The salmon is very flavorful because of the sauce and the toppings. As a ramen restaurant, it is impressive to have really tasty sushi/sashimi styled cuisine as a side.   The three different kinds of pork ramen served after. I would say the original pork has very light taste among the three. Besides of the two slices pork meat, the boiled egg is additional which the other two ramens don't come with it. I highly recommend having the boiled egg no matter which ramen you order. It is very special which the yolk is very jelly and it just tastes differently from elsewhere. The shoyo and the spicy garlic ramens are as what they called. It is a bit salty for the shoyo because of the soy sauce, and the spicy garlic tastes hot and good smelly.   The matcha cheesecake is also very special. I would say it's the Japanese style. It doesn't come with the crunchy base as this western cheesecake. It is very soft and you can feel that it's melting in the mouth.   The reason I gave a 3-star is due to the service. After we got the appetizer and the server took it right away once we finished it, we waited for roughly 25 mins for getting the noodles. Interestingly, the table seated roughly 5-10 mins after us got the ramens 5 mins before us. Hopefully, this is nothing something happening often. I will definitely upgrade the rating next time if nothing odd occurs."}
{"text":"Not bad. I had the spicy garlic ramen with the light soup base and enjoyed it. Relative to other ramen places in the GTA, I would say that it is better than Kenzo and Ajisen (which isn't really that bad for an international chain), but on par with Niwatei. The portions (noodles) are also bigger than other ramen places I think, but the meat not so much. Thank God I only waited in line for 3 minutes."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like Kinton. Unfortunately every time I went (4 times) the food just got less and less appealing. The last visit was the final nail on the coffin.   The chicken karaage was soggy. The ramen broth was so salty and lacked flavour at the same time. I asked for some hot water to pour in to the ramen to make it bareable.   Everytime I order the pork belly I ask myself - how is one supposed to eat this? It is literally a long thick chewy piece of meat. Impossible to cut chopsticks. Should I stick one side in my mouth and bite it off?!?? I asked them to cut it and they said - no.   Trendy interiors are nice but I feel like they don't value the customer. The stools are notoriously uncomfortable - really, who likes to sit on a tall wooden block for hours on end!?   Some points to consider: - Kinton doesnt seat you and makes you stand up and wait even though you're a party of two and your friend is parking, even though the restaurant is *completely* empty   - I personally saw a large family of three generations (really old grandparents adults and babies) and the restaurant was down right *incapable* of accommodating for the babies or grandparents. I saw them try to balance and climb on the wooden stools. It was so painful to watch. All for mediocre ramen."}
{"text":"I was really hungry between movies during a multiple-film TIFF day and was craving ramen noodles.  Kinton was completely satisfying. I got the chicken ramen, spicy jalapeño with thin noodles and hot sauce. Service was fast and I absolutely devoured the entire bowl within minutes. Tons of flavor with a good amount kick from the spice. The portion size was very reasonable, although it was so delicious I could have eaten more."}
{"text":"Had Canada day dinner here, not many people waiting, didn't take us long to get a table.They don't have high chairs so bring your own or you have to hold your baby when eating.  I ordered pork shouyu with thin ramen, takoyaki and chiki chiki don. Ramen was good, though the broth was a little salty. The pork was amazing, the fat perfectly added some incredible flavour to it. I don't know how to describe it, but it was really really good. Takoyaki was all right, the sauce was a bit sour. I personally dont like it. Chiki chiki don was pretty decent. Give it a try. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"If you're craving ramen while you're in the area, Kinton is not a bad place to go. The downside to that last minute craving however, is dependant on how busy the restaurant is.   My friends and I, a group of 4 arrived on a Friday night hoping to try the \"cheesy ramen\". When we called in, we were informed that they are not taking reservations. Too bad for us; it was quite busy when we arrived so there was a bit of a wait. Although the staff were very friendly, service was slow and inadequate. No one came to greet the growing line up at the doorway or take down names until a guest asked a passing staff member. Undeterred from this, we waited to taste that sweet, cheesy noodle-y goodness.  We made our orders fairly quickly once seated. 3 Paitan Cheese Ramen and 1 Spicy Pork Ramen. The cheese ramen arrived first and it was extra cheesy. Which, may or may not be a good thing depending on how much you love/can handle cheese. After a few bites, we noticed this chicken-base ramen was lacking the chicken. We asked two separate staff members: the first was our server and the second after not hearing back about the issue) eventually, a plate of chicken was brought over. My friends thought the chicken was amazing--cold, but tender. By the time the pieces of chicken made it to our table however, I was already quite full...so the experience wasn't optimal.  Although his particular experience wasn't the greatest, I am not unfamiliar with the hustle-bustle of restaurant work. While the food itself is quite enjoyable, Kinton should implement a reservation system and ensuring there is staff available to greet/take down a waiting list."}
{"text":"The newest Kinton Ramen location at Yonge and Eglinton lives up to this Toronto chains reputation. Dishing out large bowls of Ramen for $11-$17, you definitely won't be leaving hungry.   The fried chicken appetizer is a must-order for $6.   If you're thirsty, 16oz pints of Sapporo are $3.90 with any Ramen.   Enjoy!"}
{"text":"We ended up at this place waiting for another place. First of the service was pretty awesome. They were very energetic and enthusiastic. However not the best Raman place. The stocks that my friends and I had were sub parr. Maybe we made the wrong selections. But not the best stock. The fried chicken was good as an appetiser, or good in comparison to the bad Raman. All in all I would not go back."}
{"text":"The vibe: A big spot that's surprisingly fancy and beautiful on the inside. Very clean and modern look. Would be a great spot for a date.   The food: This is only my second Ramen experience ever, so I'm no pro...but I tried the spicy jalapeño ramen and it tasted good, but not great! The base was sea salt versus soy so I blame myself for choosing that option. I tried my friend's (which was soy sauced base) and I liked it a lot more!   My go to meal: Ramen lunch special!   Secret: There's a lunch special where you can get ramen with salad & ice cream. SALAD AND ICE CREAM! This place understands my essence."}
{"text":"Really disappointing tbh.  Service was mediocre, food was below par, everything was slow   Don't get the chicken karage!!   Not a fan of the small wooden chairs."}
{"text":"Toronto's been on a huge craze for ramen now a days and now I'm on a mission to try all (most) of them out.  Kinton ramen started popping up on my FB and Twitter newsfeeds with those Kinton Bowler photos everywhere and I wondered what that hype was so I did some googling and found out what it was about. It was some kind of a recognition ritual where you get a photo taken of you when you finish the entire bowl of ramen (including the broth) right to the bottom of the bowl! I was like, \"YO That's pretty dope!\".  So my friend and I ventured here for a lunch date a few weeks back just to check out the place. It was very tiny but the decor was your standard Japanese decor with wooden tables and wooden everything. The yelling and shouting was definitely there as well. If people ain't yelling at you left and right, the owners definitely weren't Japanese. (As it seems to be the trend now a days...)  I ordered the special chicken ramen and my friend got the cheese ramen. The price was right, not too expensive and it didn't really hurt the wallet either.  The seatings were really cramped, you're basically (almost) shoulder to shoulder with the person that's seated next to you.  So the food finally came, presentation was great and the giant wooden spoons were definitely there. It ain't a bowl of ramen if it don't come with them giant spoons!  We ate the noodles, the protein, the veggies and drank the soup...it was ok at best.  It was a decent bowl of ramen but definitely not the best. Soup was incredibly flavourful and the noodles were great but something was just missing.  My friend, on the other hand did not really enjoy hers. The amount of garlic that was inside her bowl of cheese ramen was way too overwhelming and took the flavour out from everything. She didn't like it and neither did I.   I LOVE GARLIC, but it was just too much garlic. Same goes for my bowl of ramen, maybe if they used half the amount of garlic they put into our ramen, it would've been a great bowl of ramen for sure.  I managed to finish the entire thing and I became a Kinton Bowler! Got my picture taken and was propped onto their Facebook album and seeing my photo was great, hehe.  Overall, love the customer loyalty program with the Kinton Bowler and the photos but the ramen was alright. I'll definitely come back to try the other stuff."}
{"text":"This 1 star is by no means for the food. I have been to many ramen establishments including the Kinton downtown more than once.  We had a party of 6 including my grandmother. We asked if we could sit at a table with chairs that had a back for the sake of my grandma but we were told that those seats were for families with children only (most seating is without a back). Noticing that there were multiple groups without children sitting at these seats (with backing), I requested one more time our preference. The waitress we were speaking to, spoke with another shaved head waiter and we could clearly see him roll his eyes, however, finally, we were given a table with seats that had a backing (waitress was not pleased). Once we sat down, we realized it was very sunny (5:40pm) but realized they did not have blinds or curtains.  This restaurant has been open for months and with all its snazzy decor, did not include blinds? Last time I checked, the sun rises and sets everyday. It was visible that people were sweating, shifting in their seats, moving to other positions and changing tables because it was blindingly sunny. I noticed a customer being seated who commented \"it's really sunny\" and the waiter/manager simply said \"ya\". The worst was noticing the same shaved head server smirk as we had to use the menus to block the sun.   With all its namesake and famous whatever, customer service is an integral part of the dining experience. If a waiter can roll his eyes and smirk in front of you, can you imagine what could happen in the kitchen?"}
{"text":"Got the spicy garlic, with thick noodles.  The noodles were under cooked. And the broth was really bland. It was also very chunky, not sure if it was chunks of fat that didn't melt away but not very appetizing. Seriously the broth was maybe the worst I had in Toronto.  As others have said the soup comes with no garnishes at all, so to have a proper bowl of ramen you end up paying a pretty hefty price for a bowl of soup, with a terrible broth.  The mini tapas were pretty good, but the gyoza was a little small compared to other ramen places where for an extra $2 you get 6 of them, and they are massive.    Wont be coming back here."}
{"text":"Great place to get rid of your ramen cravings!!! We loved it!! We had a late lunch there recently . We tried the Kinton Ball as an appetizer . We devoured it quickly and happily. Then we had the Karam Miso Ramen and the Chicken Miso Ramen. I was missing the sweet corn and bean sprouts, so I added in my ramen. I had to to use to the no back chairs.. Oh well, I was too busy enjoying my meal. We'll be returning . Thank you Kinton Ramen on Baldwin."}
{"text":"I've come here twice already and I really like the atmosphere and service -- very inviting when the whole staff greets you at once! The ramen itself is also quite good, though I must admit I'm not a huge ramen fan and therefore I'm not that picky with it. I usually get the chicken ramen, which is comes in a smaller bowl than the other meats. I like that it's not too salty! The meal package is quite a good deal so I recommend that. Would probably return when I'm feeling some ramen since I also have a discount card from school!"}
{"text":"Was really feeling the love for having Ramen, and my new favourite place happened to be closed on a a Tuesday.  Quickly did a search and found another place that was fairly close.  Walked over to Kinton, and I must say that this place has a great look from the outside.   Once inside, I was immediately greeted by a round of roars from chefs and servers (in typical Japanese fashion).  Was dinning solo, so I was seated at the bar.  Which was great because I could watch all the action of the yummy Ramen being prepared.    I ordered the Miso Pork Ramen.  I had initially thought the menu was rather limited, but then after I had ordered I realized there was a whole back page that had a number of appetizers and other small dishes.    Because I was dinning solo at the bar, the chef handed me my bowl of yummy goodness.  The ramen was served up hot and was a really good pork broth.  The noodles were cooked to perfection.  The pork belly in the ramen was also very good.  Once I was finished, the server was quick with providing the bill.  I paid and was out the door.  Overall, I had a really good meal.  I've had better ramen, but Kinton is a solid place.  I'll definitely go back and try some of the other options.  The service was definitely good and no complaints.  The place is modern and clean."}
{"text":"I'm actually kind of amazed, because when I got here on a weekday around 7PM, there was no line up and I had a seat next to the window.  Score!  I heard a lot about this place, so we had to order everything to see what it was all about.  First things first, the beer here isn't too expensive, they serve the japanese varieties of Asahi and Sapporo; with Sapporo being the beer of choice for draught.  I personally found the draught super cheap compared to the bottles, but this is one of the few places I've seen serving Asahi Dark (I really like it).  As for food, I ordered the extra pork spicy garlic ramen with medium broth and both pork shoulder as well as pork belly.  My wife ordered the miso ramen light broth and pork shoulder.  We also decided to tack on an order of gyoza because we could =).  The spicy garlic ramen was well... spicy.  Personally I found the spicyness and garlicy-ness of it way overpowering (There was a giant lump of garlic you mixed in).  In terms of the noodles, they were a nice al dente consistancy but nothing was wrong or special about them.  I think the part that set this place apart is the Pork belly (yes, belly, not shoulder).  Personally I found the shoulder really lean and dry (because it had very little to no fat).  The belly however, was presented as a whole bacon style strip about 1 cm thick and full of flavour.  They also sear it a little bit to add a bit more flavour to the flavourific potpourri of pork.  Trust me, when they ask belly or shoulder, pick belly.  It's awesome.  I had a chance to try my wife's miso ramen as well, and I can tell you that the miso ramen is way better.  The soup really pairs well with everything else.  Even little details as the corn in the soup really brings out the sweetness of the miso.    In terms of the gyoza, meh... kinda nothing special.  I probably won't order it next time.  So after all that, I can pretty much conclude that next time, I'll be ordering a miso ramen, with medium broth and pork belly.  Oh, and if you want to go crazy and get more pork belly that would be awesome too.  Fat = Flavour."}
{"text":"[4.5] I've been to this Kinton location a couple of times and their Miso ramen never disappointed me (except until they removed the egg from it). The Kinton egg is amazingly grand.  The noodles and soup base were delicious and filling. Overall, service was great and fast. Also, they have a combo that is only available on Mondays where you can get Shoyu ramen that comes with Karaage."}
{"text":"New location for Kinton!  I came here with the bf right after work so we were lucky enough to have a seat at the bar. There were many people waiting in line shortly after we were seated.   Ordered the Miso flavour, rich pork broth soup base with pork belly ramen.   It's very heavy and rich in flavour - the way I like it :) I enjoyed the ramen but I think the environment was a little rushed due to the amount of people waiting for a seat.  Services was great - friendly staffs."}
{"text":"Kinton Ramen - a Toronto go-to place for ramen!   This was my first time getting ramen to go and for lunch.  We waited a bit to pick up our order (maybe 20 mins), they were very busy in store and had quite a few food couriers standing by.  I chose to get their vegetarian bowl special, it was about $10. It came with crispy tofu, corn, sprouts, onions and mushrooms in clear broth. I like choosing this broth as it tastes less salty. I knew there were only 2 tofu nuggets, so I added chicken for an extra $2.5.  The food was kept hot. I actually mixed everything in a separate glass bowl at the office. As expected from Kinton, you will feel full and satisfied! The portions are decent, I even saved approximately half of it to take home for dinner.  My takeaway lunch experience overall was delish ^_^"}
{"text":"I've had Kinton 2 times - once when they were just opened not long ago and another time 2 months ago. I am not the biggest fan of ramen; I don't hate it but it has to really be worth it as I am not a big fan of the broth. I find that a lot of places I've had ramen at had broth that was too oily or salty for my taste. The most recent time I had Kinton, I got the Black Garlic Pork Shoulder Shio Ramen (the special of the month?) With thick noodles -  the pork shoulder was okay but I found it a little too oily for my taste, the broth was well seasoned but I found it too oily and average tasting."}
{"text":"First timer for me at this joint. So went for the original flavour. Quite a nice flavour, not salty nor fat, with a slight gelatinous texture. The broth was very flavourful. Portion size here is excellent. My ramen had 2 slices of big pork, 1 full egg, and a good amount of ramen.   I also tried my friend's soup base it was quite nice as well.   I heard a big rave about the chicken karaage. So decided to order it as well. It had a great crisp and was very moist inside. But it was a bit bland in flavour for me.   Overall, the ramen was excellent. Would definitely come back to try others."}
{"text":"We braved it here on a hot day and it wasn't that bad.    Note to all potential patrons, if you are claustrophobic, avoid this place at all costs!!!  If you have issues of personal space, check it at the door because there is nothing spacious here.  Aside from sitting on the end seat, you will definately be rubbing elbows with fellow diners here.    We were initially seated near the back and I asked if we could sit at the front.  We got to move to the front (yay) and we got the end seat (double yay) but it was by the window and it was difficult to squeeze by people sitting at the first two seats to get to my seat (litterally had to hold my breath to squeeze by).  We got the karaage, tofu nuggets and I got the swiss cheese ramen.  Man I must have unrefined taste because even though my ramen was freshly made I still prefer my instant noodle 'Sapporo Ichiban' over here.  Perhaps it was the overwhelming generous serving of bean sprouts that I got but I lost interest after the second taste.  Karaage wasn't spicy at all, and quite frankly very small for what was charged.  Tofu nuggets were ok but was it tasty?  Let's just say I found the garnish and the dip to be better overall.  Would I come back here?  Maybe but I'll pass on the bean sprouts and corn next time.  Maybe I'll get the spicy garlic ramen, hold the bean sprouts."}
{"text":"Came here for mega challenge except that we weren't here for the challenge. One massive bowl of hot and sour Ramen for $35 and if you can finish it in 15 minutes it's free. Since the bowl of noodles was massive and amount of meat generous, friend had an idea to just buy the bowl and share among us three. Was bit disappointed with the ramen thought.  First of all the bowl size is the same if we're to order a regular bowl which is between $12 and $14. Only difference is the put lots of noodles and pile lots of meat on top. True there were lots of meat but they were poor quality with lots of fat. Noodles and soup was tasteless, and not much of a broth. Asked for some hot sauce to make it taste better, but they added $1.50 charge to the bill.   I've been to this place before. Their regular bowl was so so but mega ramen probably never again."}
{"text":"Quality is great, IF you get what you actually ordered. I like to order take out from time to time. 4 out of 5 times it has been WRONG. I say this from my 5th time ordering. I DID NOT ORDER PORK... Imagine coming home and finding out you receive a completely different meat to what you ordered. I paid $20 for my order because I like to order extra. What I received was a basic $11.99 order. ONCE out of 5 times they've gotten my order correct. Every other time if it is even the right order, something is still missing."}
{"text":"Came in on a Thursday night, the restaurant itself was not so busy. After we were seated for about 15 mins we received no service at all, no menu, no water, no acknowledgement. So we simply stood up and walked out."}
{"text":"I'm going to say that I like salty food so Kinton is good for me. I also like good service which they have. But there is only one group table so no this place is not 'good for groups' despite how Yelp categorizes and it's very loud. Best to go solo or in twos.  Tried the October Special Tonkatsu Shoyu pork ramen. I actually enjoyed it because I like salty food and the meat and broth is quite salty. The pork was delicious and flavourful. But it really was a salt overload with the nori as well. I can see some people being put off by the saltiness. The noodles were not bad but I prefer softer chewier type of noodles.   Overall a nice meal for an average price."}
{"text":"I have been here several times, and every time I have had excellent service and very delicious ramen! I have tried the vegetarian, and the regular ramen and they are both very good and very good portion sizes as well. The service is very quick and friendly. It is the best thing on a cold day.  I like that I do not have to go downtown for some decent ramen all the time and it is close to me as well."}
{"text":"First time trying kinton, not a huge ramen fan but I heard this was one of the originals.   Location was packed on a Friday night (10pm) we waited 10 mins for seats for 3. We ended up sitting at a table meant for 2, but that's all good. Restaurant was packed and had a line waiting throughout our meal.   Service was quick and the server took time to explain the menu.   I ordered the spicy garlic over the original (against my better judgment), with thin noodles. Also had a side of the aged gyoza.   The gyoza were crispy and hot. The meat was full flavoured and went well with the sauce. The 4 that come as a side with the combo is a perfect amount. 3.5/5  The spicy garlic broth was delicious. Garlic is a bit overpowering but I guess that's what you ask for. The spicy broth is a 7/10 spicy, but that can be different for everyone. The broth had strong pork flavour and paired well with the noodles. I opted for the thin noodles even though the server told me the thick was better with the pork. I should have listened. The noodles we're cooked right and had the right amount of chewiness. They didn't get soggy in the broth either. The beef (all 2 slices of it) was rich in flavour and not rough. 3.5/5  One of the better ramen places I've been. Portions were on the small side so that's a (-) but would have been made better if I had known to order extra noodles and extra pork. Broth and noodles were both above standard. 4/5"}
{"text":"Can't be compared to Chinese ramen.  Broth is warm, not hot. Pork belly and veggie in ramen is cold. Spicy karage is soggy soaked in sauce that tastes like ketchup."}
{"text":"Food is great and consistent. Authentic Japanese food with good service. One small problem is the space and wait-time. Otherwise a very good ramen place."}
{"text":"Very small place and busy. Prices are a bit high and the fully loaded option doesn't look like fully loaded when you get it. There seems to be a lot of flavor seasoning product in most of their ramen dishes. But at least they are honest about it. They have a monthly ramen dish which is limited usually. Sells out pretty quick on some days."}
{"text":"Very delicious ramen. Wait time for two was 15min on a busy family day Monday night. I ordered the spicy chicken broth ramen with thick noodles, chicken breast, seaweed, scallions, and nori. The type of spiciness was a jalapeño type as opposed to the chilli type. Really suggest you to try it. The chicken breast was also pretty smooth and tender. Very nice! :)"}
{"text":"I came here to try some ramen for the first time. I seen this place busy all the time so I came to check it out. The place is nice it is small that is why it seems busy. I ordered the meal of spicy garlic and my friend got the chicken spicy jalapeno. I tried both I will definetly recoment the pork spicy garlic amazing I loved it will definitely come again for more. The spicy chicken jalapeno not so much it was not as tasty as it is also pork tasted better than the chicken. It is a good place and I will definetly recoment people to come and try ramen at this location.  Washroom was nice and clean they have mouth wash and tooth pick which is nice."}
{"text":"Came here during the MEGA SHOYU RAMEN challenge.  Started lining up at 5:30pm and took about 30 mins to get seated.  A few friends and I weren't interested in doing the challenge but wanted to try the MEGA SHOYU RAMEN so we split it.  The ramen came in a regular kinton ramen bowl and contained Karaage x 12, Beansprouts x 3, Thick Noodle x 3, seaweed & green onion garnish.  Noodles and soup was bland and we needed to add condiments to give it more flavour.   Karaage was crispy and meat was moist which I liked.  Portion size was big enough to satisfy our appetite.  Cost was $30 which is alright considering how much food was in the bowl.  We didn't stay long in the restaurant but was able to witness one person successfully complete the challenge.  He got a group picture with staff members and also got his meal for free.  I'd recommend going there early because when we left the lineup was twice as long."}
{"text":"This is a new location and was opened for few weeks. I saw the review, it wasn't that good but I still went there to give it a try. Cause I don't want to drive all the way to downtown. They do have a location at North York but it seems there's no parking. This location have lots of parking space due to it's located in Markham and it's in a plaza.  I didn't need to wait for a seat maybe I went there around like 10pm. They served the food fast I don't need to wait. I saw a lot of reviews said you need to wait for a long time.   I think overall was ok. I think I should go for a second time earlier when it's around lunch hour or dinner time and see if I need to wait for the food."}
{"text":"It was good but not amazing. Nowhere near as good as Santouka Hokkaido. Plus points for fast service and friendly staff. I had the February special (spicy with pork and thick noodles), and my dinner date had a custom garlic spicy ramen. Both good. The broth could have been deeper and more flavourful. Gyoza was also good."}
{"text":"I wanted ramen and a quick dinner so I came here around 6:30pm on Wednesday. It was very busy and it took 40 minutes before I got my food. The ramen was good, the pork soup was good but I wish there was more ingredients. I love ramen with menma (bamboo shoots) and there wasn't an option to add that. Much of the add ons were sauces than actual ingredients. This makes the value not as good as other ramen places.  Last complaint... please change the music. The whole time it was playing extremely fast bpm music (Korean techno?) I was going crazy! I never thought background music at a restaurant had such a big effect on the dining experience until this evening. I used to roll my eyes at people that comment on music in a restaurant, and now I get it. I felt so rushed and uncomfortable... I don't know if I'd come back given there are so many other ramen places nearby."}
{"text":"Kinton Ramen is probably my favourite ramen joint in Montreal.   I ordered the original pork broth ramen with thick noodles. I always need to taste the broth before anything else, and it did not disappoint. It was super rich in pork flavour. The noodles were perfect, not too soggy. The pork slices were delicious and melted in your mouth. I also had an order of takoyaki which were very good! Will definitely keep going back here."}
{"text":"My 2nd time at this location, the decor is on par with Kinka Izakayas brand.  The menu has ramen side and izakaya side, perfect for those uptown who wants a close izakaya to hang out with.    I was here to fight the cold with a bowl of ramen, so I ordered my usual Pork Original.  The noodle bowl took them 10 minutes to make, as it came, the soup was good temperature, not too salty and the noodles were made to my liking.  The pork was awesome as it came with 3 pieces, featuring The pork shoulder and pork belly.   The damage was 10.99 plus tax.  Tip:  Sit at the bar for the full ramen experience, just like the ones in Japan."}
{"text":"Pretty good ramen. Taste just like in Japan. I recommend the pork thick soup and thin noodle combo. Location pretty good for people who live and work in the area. Went in around 3pm on weekday and it wasn't busy at all. Service was awesome."}
{"text":"First time here and was welcome by a loud chef which is ok. But it gets annoying after awhile because he kept yelling. I order the spicy garlic chicken breast thick ramen. I am very disappointed with this restaurant. It was only a little spicy with too much garlic. The noodle was too hard. Only give 2 thin slice of chicken breast and some bean spout. For over $12 I can get a much better ramen at Kenzo on yonge and steeles. The service is very good. I don't think I would come again."}
{"text":"Spicy pork ramen with thick noodle + sweet seasoned egg. The spicy broth definitely has heat! Add some spicy powder for an extra kick. This location doesn't have the choice of pork belly/shoulder - default one of each.   Original pork ramen with thin noodle - the soup is soo good! Creamy and fragrant without being overly heavy/fatty. Added corn and it was a pretty big portion.    I'm still not a huge fan of the noodles, but overall it's a decent meal.   Larger space with various seating to accommodate small and large groups."}
{"text":"Great tasting Ramen! Very nice small restaurant.. The Waiters and the cook are very loud as they yell good bye to every people that comes out of the restaurant. Music is quite loud as well that you can hardly make a conversation inside.."}
{"text":"In the world of Asian noodle soups, pho for me is the clear winner. I could eat it everyday, with it's consistency and flavor it makes a great meal anytime I am awake, no matter what the time of day.  The same cannot be said for ramen, but not because it is not flavorful or consistent, but strictly because of personal preference. That being said, I can still appreciate the quality of food even for those that do not top my favorites list, such as ramen.  This particular ramen restaurant is what I would qualify as the top shelf of it's less than worthy opponents. As a lifelong fan of Sapporo Ichiban style ramen noodles, I was expecting something different the first time I partook in my first meal at one of the new wave of the many ramen soup stops here in Toronto. The particular restaurant shall remain unnamed, but let it be said that for $37, all my friend and I got was two small bowls of soup with about 4 thin strips of meat, 1 mushroom in each bowl and an appetizer. The noodles were not fresh and the portion was seriously lacking. I went home and had a bowl of the aforementioned Ichiban while remaining unimpressed with my recent food experience.  Kinton Ramen puts all of those points to shame. Service is great and you are greeted with a warm Japanese hello upon your arrival. They seat you quickly. The broth is rich and flavorful. The noodles are fresh and aplenty. I ordered the pork belly and it was fatty and delicious. The serving was enough to leave me without hunger for a substantial amount of time, and the dumpling appetizer (Gyozo) was tasty and juicy. Drink water as the broth is on the salty side, but the experience is worth the trip. Also, if you finish your entire bowl (both and all), they give you a pin and post your picture on twitter. Nice that they give props to their fans ;)"}
{"text":"It was my first time eating ramen and loved it so much. The restaurant is also very hip, modern and clean. The servers are very amicable and sweet. Loved it!"}
{"text":"Food: 3/5, service: 2/5, and cleanness: 2/5  My and my bf decided to try their February special ramen and their spicy garlic pork ramen. They are not bad, I'd say the presentation of the food was good. But taste wise honestly it was very average compares to other ramen I've had in the city.   The service was not outstanding at all. Since we were offered to sit until we decided to leave, the whole time no waitress/waiter came to us to top our water, or ask about how the meal was, etc.   The table was disgustingly dirty. I swiped on the table with napkins, and it was all dirt. I reported to the waitress instantly and all she did was to take my napkins from me. Good thing I took a picture of it before they took it away.  So overall, I probably wouldn't wanna go back."}
{"text":"Came here on a Thursday night.  It was BUSY.  Portions are good and food is good.  I think I can get away with ordering one bowl of noodles & 2 appetizers, instead of ordering 2 bowls of noodles & 2 appetizers between 2 people it was way too much for me.  Because of the good portions I got go pack some food home too!  Food was a little heavy for my liking.  Seating was a little cramped.  Everything else was good.  If you decide to come after 630pm be prepared to wait.  Overall good restaurant."}
{"text":"Let's start with the worst part - my partner-in-crime found a lovely thick black hair woven through his last slice of pork in his ramen! I immediately called the waitress, and her solution was to try to give us another bowl of ramen, but the shoyu was so over-salted and he was soo grossed out that we declined it. She then gave us a coupon for free gyoza (dumplings) which had fine print saying you have to purchase a bowl of ramen to redeem it.  When this was happening, I was only halfway through my own bowl of ramen and she handed us the bill and said she'd taken off 50% for the one bowl of ramen with the hair in it. Then constantly checked back to see if we had put down money even though I was still eating. It felt like she was trying to shoo us out - just ridiculous.  I ordered the original and he ordered the Shoyu. The original had thick layer of oil on top with almost no taste, which I found odd because I've had it before and remember it having much more taste to it. The shoyu was extremely salty, it was unbelievable and hard to finish - especially after we found the black hair in it.  We paid, left the coupon as we knew we would never return, and walked out the door."}
{"text":"Ramen was good. We had the Pork Miso soup ramen. The Japanese tea & homemade lemonade is not that good. The homemade lemonade for $2 extra with combo was very bitter and sour, would never order again. The green tea cheesecake small & just ok. Nothing impressive. Would only order ramen here next time and nothing else. The pork dumplings side dish was good. Chicken side dish & rice is not that good, never order again..."}
{"text":"Kinton use to be our go to ramen in Montreal, unfortunately the quality and quantity has changed.  It could have been an off night, however the spicy ramen broth tasted watered down and oily, not the usual creaminess and thick consistency we are use too. Pork belly was half the size compared to the numerous occasions we have received. In addition, the server forgot our karaage and charged us extra for a side of garlic we never ordered nor received when we simply requested the garlic to be put on the side.  It's unfortunate this scenario occurred as Kinton was one of the best options for Japanese ramen downtown, but now left with nothing."}
{"text":"I used to always come here for the ramen combo with tofu nuggets and takoyaki add on for a discounted price. They just removed these combo options so you have to pay full price now. Nothing special about this place anymore..."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant. In my top 2.  Don't come here if you've just eaten because it's very filling. And if you can sit at the bar and you get to watch the chefs cook!"}
{"text":"This has recently become my go-to and favourite ramen spots. I typically go for the spicy garlic ramen which has a great kick to it and love the minced garlic on it. Noodles are cooked perfectly (I usually get thin) and the meat is decent. The combos are a good deal for a couple bucks more and the apps are not that expensive. Would get any of the items.  The wait to get in is typically only a few min if at all. I love sitting in front of the kitchen and just watching the cooks work. It's a well oiled machine and something I can appreciate.  With all the ramen places downtown now, I still find myself coming back to Kinton for the ambience, food, value (used to be more expensive but seems other places have increased), and usually no wait."}
{"text":"I've heard amazing things about Kinton, and I was not disappointed. We dropped by for dinner on New Years and it was definitely crowded. We got bar seats within 15 minutes, and I'm actually glad we did because there was a bit of entertainment throughout our meal from the chefs, who yelled and danced every time they drained the noodles.  We all ordered a version of their pork ramen, which had some of the best broth I've ever had. You can add corn for some added flavour, but I think the original is great on its own. Definitely a solid choice for ramen in the area."}
{"text":"A rather disappointing experience. I ordered a Shio (salt) pork ramen. The ramen order itself does not come with much (noodles, bean sprouts, couple sheets of seaweed, the pork, and finally topped off with green onions) if you want anything else in that broth (ie. egg, cheese..etc.) it'll cost you an additional $1-$5 per item. The pork was delicious, the noodles were slightly on the tough side, however the broth was a mess. The broth I was served tasted very monotonous and mediocre. I can't pinpoint it but it just wasn't good. Most reviewers said it was too salty, maybe they have changed it since but I found the saltiness to be just fine. If you plan to give this place a try I would recommend going with another broth.  Service was satisfactory. The tip options on their debit/credit machine defaults at a minimum of 15%. Call me cheap but I think they should at least have staff that could speak fluent English before being so conceited on their service."}
{"text":"You can always count on Kinton to hit your \"it's cold I want something soupy and yummy\" cravings. Personally I always get the pork based soups as I think it has more flavour. But other than the ramen here, I don't suggest getting anything else. I've found that most of the dishes here are overly salted (especially the salmon tataki), even the soup bases are on the salty side. But yeah - other than that, the marinated egg and pork belly is HELLA bomb. Overall, Kinton definitely hits the spot whenever those cravings hit!"}
{"text":"We went here for the grand opening at William Kitchen location, it was a 1+ hour wait because they had the a deal *half off =$8.00 for  * I have never been to Kinton before. The staff was nice and they greeted you as you came in and as you left. The ramen base was yummy . I tried my friend ramen and his was good too. I had a spicy pork with extra pork *next time I won't get extra pork, it was a lot for me*... Also you can get a Kinton Bowler Card -from my understanding is if you and you only eat everything in your bowl you will get a stamp!"}
{"text":"Kinton Ramen is definitely a restaurant worth going back to. It may not look like much, but it has an irresistible taste to it. The presentation of its dishes are set up like how you would expect a bowl of ramen should look; the difference is, these noodles aren't just for show, it proves its worth. I recommend going with the original with thin noodles like others have been saying. I prefer the chicken broth, but beef is also a fine choice. It comes with a delectable egg; one that is unmatched. I'm not even a big fan off eggs, but this takes the cake. The appetizers are ok, though you probably don't even need them. The servings are fairly large and each bowl can fill you to the brink. Wrapping my review up, the only things you REALLY need to know to eat here is to choose your preferred choice. (But, the original is best)"}
{"text":"Definitely a must go-to if you're ever craving ramen!  Upon arriving, we were immediately seated right before the place became packed. The workers were very friendly and the menu was very easy to read. Unlike most ramen places that I've been to, you can choose between thin or thick noodles if ordering ramen. There are many additional toppings to choose from, however, these cost extra.  I ordered the Pork Original and just wow, it tasted amazing! The pork wasn't too chewy or too soggy and the noodles had this smooth, silky texture. The broth had the perfect seasoning as well. It was the best ramen I had in a long while.   There is also a coat rack near the entrance of the restaurant as some of the seats are stools, making it nearly impossible to hang your coat behind/on your chair. It took awhile to get one of the worker's attention to retrieve the bill and I believe the place did not have wi-fi. I certainly will come back in the future and try out the other dishes that Kinton has to offer!"}
{"text":"I don't usually get chicken ramen, but their spicy jalapenos chicken ramen was very good. I'm always hesitant about getting chicken breast because 95% of the time it is dry, but their chicken breasts here very tender and soft. We also got their BBQ chicken, oh my yum! So good. Service is quick and friendly, environment is a little loud, but that never bothers me, I'm ALL about my food."}
{"text":"Super lousy music, couldn't even hear what the waiter was trying to tell us. Pretty much had to yell at each other. Waited over 30min and still haven't received our food!!!"}
{"text":"So trendy it hurts.  Baldwin Street has been graced with a Japanese-style ramen shop where the staff shout those incomprehensible Japanese phrases that one hears regularly upon entering and leaving trendy Japanese places.  That was an awkward sentence.  Let's get down to it, the ramen is pretty darn good and the portions are rather generous.  The chicken ramen (which seems to be the perpetual special) is a good entry ramen...it's not as rich.  I did enjoy it, but can't help but find the chicken breast slightly slimy...it's not a fault of theirs, just how that turns out in this context.  I loved the spicy garlic ramen.  CAUTION: When enjoying this, do not plan on kissing anyone for the day, or for that matter speaking closely with anyone you like.  It's garlicky!  Also very rich and flavorful.  This restaurant is good, but not good enough to justify the waits.  It's slightly pricy.  Ramen is a pedestrian, everyday food in Japan, eaten for $4-7 a bowl without much fuss.  It's cute how trendy it's gotten in North America.  Add-ons and drinks are a bit on the pricey side.    Seating is largely communal or counter-based.  Not a good spot for a large group unless you get lucky with timing and the big table in the window is open.  It's also loud, especially with the shouting of IRASSHAIMASE everytime someone walks in. That being said, I like the ramen, so I'll be back."}
{"text":"I've been to this place many many times because I live really close to it. I am greeted every time I walk on by the waiter or waitress and it always wakes me up.   I have consistently been trying one particular ramen here, but I have tried many of their side dishes. The spicy pork ramen (with pork shoulder OR belly, both are good), with no bean sprouts and extra spicy with thick noodles and rich broth. It is definitely going to make you sweat a bit, make you choke a few times because of the small pieces of garlic, but ask for a cup of ice water and enjoy it cause it is good!!  The pork is always BOMB, there is nothing wrong with it ever. It's super tender and flavourful and it melts in you mouth. The broth is also super rich and tasty. Do not waste the broth! Drink it until you literally cannot eat anymore! The noodles are perfectly cooked too. It is no soft to the point baby food, it is cooked al dente (or to the tooth), and it's perfect together with the hot broth and meat and everything.   I have also tried their takoyaki (squid balls), karage (spicy and original, I actually prefer the original cause I don't like the spice they use for the spicy one), chiki chiki and Ton ton Don (Don means rice in japanese. And it's basically marinated chicken or pork with rice). But remember, these are only side dishes. My favourite of the side dishes has to be the takoyaki or original karage. If you want to try something new, you can try the rice side dishes but I feel like sometimes they are a bit too try (at least for my liking). If you want something less oily and flavourful, you can go for the rice side dishes.   This place is a neat little place and I'm so glad I live near it. You should all give it a try!"}
{"text":"I flew in to Montreal, and my buddy I was meeting said he wanted ramen. Well, I just flew back from Japan 5 days earlier, so I was trying to ramen detox. But I was also curious to try a ramen place again in North America now that I knew real ramen. Kinton was open late, so we gave it a shot.  I got the pork ramen with thin noodles, and they had a deal where a Sapporo was $3.90 when you buy a ramen. Total with tax was $19.41. Ramen was really good, though I still don't think North American ramen will ever hold up to Japenese.  The service here really shined. Friendly people not really seeming to mind that we stayed until actual closing time. Super sweet waitress, and they made sure to come over at the end to ask us if we wanted anything else from the bar before they closed.  Apparently this is a chain in Toronto and this is the only one in Montreal. Will have to remember that next time I'm in Toronto!"}
{"text":"So this is my second time here at Kinton Ramen 1 and I came here with my boy Kris U. While I waited I tried some of their Hogtown Ale which was only $3 a Tallboy (Sunday - Thursday). Hogtown in brewed in the city of TDot or what most of us would now call the 6ix. Surprisingly it was decent beer, very light and easy to drink. I finished it pretty quickly and was still feeling thirsty. I had to relax because it was only noon, don't want people to think I am an alcoholic or anything. When it was time to order I had my mind set on the Extra Pork Shoulder Ramen in Spicy Garlic Broth w/ Thick Noodles. I devoured it and man I would say I made a great choice. The pork shoulder was tender, the noodles were perfect in firmness, and that broth was good to the last drop. Speaking of last drop, when you finish your bowl of Ramen to the last drop you can get a stamp which marks your accomplishment of each and every bowl. They have milestones at 10, 30, 50, 100, 500, and 1000 bowls and rewards with each of those milestones. Realistically who in their right mind would eat 1000 bowls of Ramen? That is basically once everyday for 3 years. Like common I love Ramen, but I don't know if I could hit the 1000 Kinton Bowler. The service is always great. They greet you, and when they are busy and cant get right to you they acknowledge you and they have seen you. They are pretty quick in service too. I almost thought I was in a fast food restaurant because the Ramen came out in less than 5 minutes. Overall this is the best Ramen place I've been to so far and I'd make my way back here for my Ramen fix, and I'd suggest everyone to do the same. Until next time, JimStar Out!!"}
{"text":"Their jalapeno ramen is a must try! Their side rice dishes are also very delicious. Maybe it's just me, but I find everything else too oily & salty. Also there's rust on every single one of their cups lol."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere. When you enter the restaurant, all the staff welcomes you! One of the best ramen in Montreal. Took the combo that includes chiki chiki don and the pork spicy ramen. Would come again."}
{"text":"First thing's first - the staff is really nice. The food is pretty good. Comes hot and fresh out the kitchen. Location gets pretty busy, but it's downtown Toronto - can't expect for more space.   Nonetheless, a must try!"}
{"text":"Finally! A Mississauga location. Just like the Toronto location, this location is also great!   We ordered the following:  1. Deep fried chicken karaage: 10/10. Served with garlic mayo. This app was served fresh and right out of the fryer.   2. Chicken Shoyu w/ thick noodles: 10/10. I added the seasoned egg which made the dish even better. The taste was good, presentation was decent & portioning is just perfect for one person.   3. Pork Spicy Garlic w/ thick noodles: 10/10. Added the seasoned egg. This dish is really good for those who want something hot and spicy! Portioning & presentation was good!   Bonus, if you finish your ramen completely you get a stamp on your loyalty card. Once you reach a certain number of stamps, you get some benefits!   This place will be seeing me again!"}
{"text":"I lived in Japan for over a year on an internship years ago and I tasted ramen in various prefectures. Having a bowl of ramen at Kinton brought me back in time to Japan. It certainly warmed me up too as it was a chilly Saturday morning in January.  The food: When you order ramen, you will be asked if you want shoulder or belly pork. I had the basic miso ramen with shoulder pork and an extra order of seaweed. I would have to say that you do want some fat in the pork and that's what makes it tasty. Not to worry that shoulder would be too lean as there will be just enough amount of fat to give you that flavour that you crave for. I have yet to try the belly pork. If you opt for a very rich soup base, pick the miso. If you want to be easier on your sodium intake, pick the shio, it's much lighter tasting.  The decor: It is the communal table, tight seatings and the use of wooden furnitures that created a genuine Japanese experience. The artfully created wall with tidily stacked wooden blocks oriented at an angle is iconic.   I think most people do not know that ramen is of Chinese origin. I learned that when I was in Japan and asked by my Japanese teacher what Japanese food I liked the most and I responded ramen. She chuckled that it doesn't really count as traditional Japanese food. The Japanese for sure has made a successful twist on the noodles and created a national specialty."}
{"text":"I kept hearing great things about Kinton Ramen so i decided to give it a shot. The place itself is super cute. Not too crowed, very nice decor and sweet staff. My husband and i tried the gyoza and fried chicken as our appetizer. The fried chicken was delicious with a nice dipping sauce. The gyoza were good, but a bit too much sauce for my taste (i like the sauce served on the side!). We got some ramen (of course) and they were amazingggg. Definitely the star of the show!"}
{"text":"A solid bowl of ramen, though not the best I've had. Came here for a late dinner with a group of four and was promptly seated. For starters, we had the edamame and karaage (fried chicken). The karaage (4 pieces) was excellent, perfectly fried and juicy. My group had the miso ramen, original, and spicy garlic. Spicy garlic was delicious but really lingers on the breath (even after brushing!). The original broth is rich and decadent - qualitywise probably the best of the broths. The pork that came with these bowls was of normal quality, not particularly outstanding. I recommend getting a seasoned egg if your bowl doesn't come with one. Their homemade lemonade is nice and tart, not highly sweet, and a great compliment to the rich ramen.   Overall, a good ramen place for a decent price, though not highly affordable or amazing. Kinka Izakaya is my favorite izakaya in the city and right next door if you wanna check that out as well."}
{"text":"Parking is hit or miss at this location. There's lots of other restaurants and shops sharing the lot. Dining area is large but by no means spacious. Lots of small tables and stools for patrons to sit. Don't recommend coming in large groups - it'll take you a while to get a table. Also don't recommend coming here with any bags/jackets/peripherals. There's simply no space to hang anything/put anything down (stools have no backs!) I abhor coming here in winter months. Do I leave my coat at the rack by the door? Do I keep it on? Should I walk in without my coat?  Menu items are good, but I feel like the food's better at their downtown location. Also - every time I come here, the egg is overcooked, like hard-boiled-overdone.   Prices are a little steeper than other ramen places in the area (e.g. Sansotei).  This location isn't really worth the trek out for, but if I'm in the area, I don't mind stopping in."}
{"text":"The wait for a seat is long, and then the wait for food is long. The seating is mostly bar seating, so it's not that good for groups.  I had the Shoyu ramen is the traditional version.  Shoulder was very lean, but also a bit dry. And the belly was very tasty, but a bit too fatty. It was nice to have half & half so that I could mix the two. The egg is soft in the center and is quite delicious.  spicy Chicken Karaage was probably the best order. Very tender and moist pieces of chicken smothered in sauce.  The spicy Garlic broth has a taste which is similar to kim-chi sauce.  I would be happy going back if it was half empty, otherwise the wait isn't worth it. If you have all night to wait around and you don't care, then upgrade it to 4 stars."}
{"text":"Target customer: health conscious youth looking for a simple, clean, quick meal  Kinton 2 is solid. Ramen is great in the winter, when you want a hot broth to warm you to the bone.  Pro tip: Eat the egg near the beginning of your meal.  I like the spicy garlic broth. It adds a nice kick, but won't kill anyone with a reasonable tolerance to spice.  Rich broth can be overkill for some people. Know thyself. It tastes great, but can be too much for a full meal.  The appetizers are average. I think the ramen is solid enough on its own, so it might be better to soup up your ramen (e.g extra pork)"}
{"text":"The favourite ramen shop nearby was closed, so we decided to expand our horizons and give Kinton a try. We were greeted promptly the moment we walked in, and was seated at the bar right beside another couple. Be prepared to rub elbows with whoever is beside you because the seating is tight. Good thing there is a coat rack for the heavy winter coats or it would be very cumbersome.  The ramen itself was sadly disappointing. I had the original pork, and found the broth incredibly salty. There is a wide gap between flavour and just salt, and this bowl definitely veered off to the dark side of flavor. I couldn't taste anything besides the salt in the slices of meat, or the broth, or even the thin layer of black garlic oil. The meat had large strips of fat in it, so very little meat was actually served. The noodles are more than just chewy, again veering off to dark side of uncooked. In the future, I will stick to my old favourites instead."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I ordered the shio and shoyu ramen, but found it too salty. However, the takoyaki and the karaage chicken was delicious."}
{"text":"When you have a ramen craving this place is a must! The North York location is pretty small so you better come at an off time. I recommend the shoyu chicken broth with thick noodles. The appetizer with rice and ground pork is a must try."}
{"text":"Bon, comme première expérience de Ramen c'était ok. Mais je recherchais un peu plus de goût. Par contre, tous les éléments y étaient, légumes frais, belle qualité de viande, texture des nouilles juste à point, mais je n'ai personnellement pas trippé sur le bouillon. J'ai pris l'original et mon conjoint le spicy. Le sien était 10 fois meilleur que le mien. J'ai vraiment aimé l'oeuf au thé noir qu'il y avait dedans, wow! Les entrées de riz et poulet ou riz et porc était très bonnes! Le service était chaleureux et l'endroit propre et très joli. Je reviendrai c'est certain, mais pour essayer autre chose sur le menu."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Considering the place was not empty I was extremely disappointed when I couldn't get a waiter to take our order. Further to that our order came in much later than a couple that came much later than us. The place I would say was about 75% capacity. So it was inexcusable imo. The ramen itself was good. Broth was tasty but disappointed that it doesn't come with an egg like other ramen places. Also disappointed there is a mix option in the meat and it isn't stipulated in the menu. Just overheard it when it was suggested by the waiter to the couple beside us."}
{"text":"When I went to Vancouver, I had vowed that I was never going to have ramen in Toronto ever again.  To my happiness, there was an announcement that Guu was opening a ramen restaurant in Toronto (and just down the street from where I work!)  I have gone twice now.  Despite the fact that line-ups are long and how warm it is inside there, the food is delicious.  Hands down, the best ramen in Toronto.  In regards to line-ups.  I always go a bit earlier (5-10 minutes before opening), and we get in quickly.  So no complaints there.  The fact that the restaurant has an open concept kitchen to watch the chefs cook the ramen, it makes the place really really warm.  However, I don't mind.  The food compensates for the heat.  Yes, I know.  Eating hot ramen doesn't really help the heat in the place, but I absolutely love it.  I went the first time and got the miso ramen, which was amazing.  However, no boiled egg in it.  I also had the calpico, not suggested.  The second time I went, I had the spicy garlic ramen - I loveeeeeeed it.  Does not include an egg either, but I got one with it with an additional fee.  The egg is boiled to perfection (soft boiled).  The house lemonade is recommended, as it provides a refreshing feeling in the heat.  The servers there are quite awesome, and are very talkative as well.  I remember speaking to someone the first day I was there, and they told me that all the chefs are from Japan.  They actually flew in one of the chefs into Toronto the day of grand opening to cook for us!  I am a lover of ramen.  I am just very very very happy to know that there is a LEGIT and REAL Japanese ramen restaurant in Toronto.  Can't wait for the other ones to open up this summer."}
{"text":"Mmm I love ramen, have been to a Kinton location downtown, and was thoroughly satisfied by this one just the same! I shared the takoyaki with a friend and had the Vegetarian Ramen. Takoyaki was good, better than other places I've had it, and the ramen was very enjoyable. I ordered extra noodles; my only complaint is that they loaded my bowl with soooo many veggies and for the extra that I paid I felt like there could've been more noodles. But the taste was there and I was still happy after my meal. The veggie ramen comes with these two tofu cakes (I think it's tofu) which I would recommend you eat without getting too much soup on it. It's crunchy before it gets soggy for being in the soup for too long. I left it in and had a soggy nugget. The place was clean and service was friendly! Will be back!"}
{"text":"I love ramen so it's no surprise that I loved this restaurant. While it is quite busy, service is pretty speedy and the taste and quality of food is amazing. They have plenty of different ramen flavours for both pork and chicken as well as a couple vegetarian options. Would recommend for all ramen lovers!"}
{"text":"I visited this location last night for dinner. We were seated quickly even though it was quite busy! (It was only the two of us, so it was easy to squeeze us in) we were welcomed by the whole kitchen crew and wait staff by some type of greeting in Japanese. It was welcoming and set a good tone.   It took us several minutes to look through the menu and figure things out. Nobody had come to offer us drinks or answer questions about the menu. Wait staff and kitchen staff were buzzing around, super busy. When we chose our items, we flagged down the sever and ordered.   We were entertained by the busy atmosphere and the food we smelled and saw all around us. The general atmosphere was typical for a Friday night dinner service. The music was turned up a bit too loud, it was a little hard to talk and hear our server.   We noticed that the servers weren't as efficient as they could've been which resulted in a long wait to order, receive food, receive our bill and also a long line up at the door. At one point, we saw cooks from the kitchen coming out to serve food that had been sitting waiting for a long time. Also, we noticed a few tables growing impatient waiting so long for their bills. Because it took so long for tables to be paid out and cleared, the line up at the door grew pretty long.   Anyway... I hope they're able to refine their service and keep up with the high demand. They'll do well if they continue to improve. Looking forward to trying again in a few weeks"}
{"text":"After living in Japan for 2 years, I have very high expectations for ramen. I went to Kinton Ramen because a friend invited me to it and another friend recommended it. I was not going with high hopes but to my surprise it was a great experience!  The staff yelling out to welcome you, to say thank you and waiters yelling out orders to the kitchen, all reminded me of Japan haha  I had the delicious Spicy Karaage Ramen (fried chicken) with extra bean sprouts. The noodles were thick, which went well with the ramen soup. It wasn't too spicy and was great to have on a winter night in Toronto.  I've been here twice and highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this place. The restaurant is small but the atmosphere is good. Visited on a Friday night and there was a slight wait for a table. Lots of other people waiting too and there isn't much room. Waited a little bit longer for a 2 person table along the wall as opposed to sharing a long table with others.   The food was great. Got the extra pork ramen with pork belly and pork shoulder. Very tasty. Got the beer combo special so I added a pint of Sapporo and two pieces of gyoza for $6. Also had the spicy karrage which was good.   Service was excellent as well. Very nice and friendly.   All in all, great place. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Ramen has very tasty broth. Pork belly blowtorch seared to perfection.  The thick noodles themselves were a tad undercooked. We sat at the bar so we saw them going into the boiling water at the same time with other thin noodles , and were fished out at the same time too - so it's not enough time to cook well . Japanese ramen noodles don't need the al dente texture.  Side dish - deep fried takoyaki is stored bought Frozen takoyaki, a bit disappointing. Original karaage , on the other side , is crispy on the outside and juicy in the inside. Overall, this is a good place for a quick bite or working lunch."}
{"text":"Lets get the con out of the way first... yes, the wait is redunkulously long.  You need to come in a very small group, even with 2 on a tuesday night, the wait was about 45 min.  With that said, this is one of the best ramen shops I've been to.  All they have is ramen and some appetizers.  You basically choose from 4 different kinds of ramen bases and customize it to your choice.  You get to choose what kind of port you want, the soup base, and how strong and flavorful you want the soup.  It's a fantastic idea because everyone's tastes are a little bit different when it comes to soup and what is \"perfect\".    The noodles though, were PERFECTLY cooked.  nice and tender and definitely not overcooked. We tried the Shoyu and the Miso - both were delicious and strong in flavor (we got the most savory option for the soup) which is how we like it.  One very unique thing was how they did their hard boiled egg - the middle was somehow still yolky.  The soporo + Lemonade drink was also surprisingly good combo.  One of the added bonuses is if you get to sit in front of the chefs - they definitely have it down to a science and is very entertaining to watch.    We got to meet the manager and head chef since my friend showed off his empty bowl.  He's a super nice and humble guy - everything you'd expect from a Japanese host - so I do hope his business succeeds."}
{"text":"After reading other reviews, i can see most people have the same critiques. In regards to the wait time, if you're a party of 2, waiting isn't going to be more than 10-15 mins (I only waited 5 mins on a busy saturday night). THE ONLY ISSUE IS WAITING FOR THE FOOD. That takes waaaaay longer and i mean ramen is a relatively fast dish to prepare.   Okay on to the actual food review: I got their lemonade which tasted like the tim horton's lemonade with some yuzu mixed in. I personally didn't like it. The we got the kakimayo which was really good. Its exactly the same as the one at kinka. Then my boyfriend and I got an original ramen and a miso ramen. THE MOST ANNOYING THING ABOUT KINTON RAMEN(all locations) IS THAT THEIR EGGS ARE ALWAYS OVER COOKED. The noodles were nice and bouncy but the soup for the miso ramen was super salty."}
{"text":"SOUP BASE: The most important component of a bowl of ramen is the soup base. But this is exactly what we were disappointed at. It was simply salty and you couldn't really tell the essence of pork.   NOODLE: As a chain store, I won't expect they make the fresh noodles in shops. But I could see from my counter seat they were taking it from a plastic crate with noodles wrapped in plastic paper, then put the crate into the wooden tray, pretended them to be \"fresh\". Please, just don't fake it. The noodle itself is just okay but could not beat the really fresh made ones.  SERVICE: Service was good, the waiters were quite attentive and friendly. The place was okay clean."}
{"text":"Love love love this place! Every time I come here, I get the spicy garlic pork with thin noodles and add seaweed. Best comfort food ever!"}
{"text":"I ordered the White Ramen, you can decide if that is a cultural reference or not. They called it Clam Chowder Ramen.   It had 2 clam shells, and a creme (maybe milk) based broth. None of the rest of it resembled a chowder. A few shreds of green onion, mozzarella cheese (which it does not need) and crispy seaweed. (if you read that un-enthusiastically, thats my fault)  It was good, the broth was tasty; great levels of flavor and while the broth was visually white the flavors were what I expected from a Ramen restaurant.  I find it funny that people eating Ramen, like to talk about Ramen, while they eat Ramen.   This bowl of food was alot of things, filling it was not. Satisfying it was, and now I write like Yoda.  /another almost totally unhelpful review."}
{"text":"The ramen here is really good! Love the pork spicy one with thin noodles. What I dont like is the seating arrangements. I get that it gets busy and sometimes you have to sit with other people. I personally dont like that unless im in a big group. Im lucky that a table left and I was able to grab it. Or else I was in the middle of two groups of people and they didnt look happy I was in their space.   Washroom was super clean and the staff were really nice. Great service! That is a big plus since more ramen joints kind of neglect on that. I would come back for sure when. 4 stars ****"}
{"text":"I ordered a chicken ramen but my chicken was undercooked. The meat was pink and the texture felt weird. I've ordered this a dozen times at their Bloor location and have never been served pink chicken. The waiter said all their chicken is cooked like that, slightly undercooked. I don't think it's safe to eat chicken that's not fully cooked (I always remember Gordon Ramsay screaming at chefs on tv when the chicken is still raw inside). When I told the waiter that Bloor cooks it all the way through, he said \"yeah, they cook it differently\". But why? It's the same restaurant!  The rest of the ramen was ok but I won't be going back to this location."}
{"text":"This is my go to place for ramen when I'm in the area! You can customize what you get in your bowl such as meats, noodles and other things such as an egg, and they're all pretty damn good. I don't think I've tried something here that I didn't like. Although I must say my favourite is the original ramen with the chicken. The chicken has a unique flavour. I'm not sure what seasoning they use on it, but it's great."}
{"text":"I heard this place is not as good as the one in downtown but thought I'll try it anyway since it's new and hot in uptown.  Ramen was more on a salty side which was fine with me as I noticed Kinton seem to be like that anyway. What disappointed me the most is NOT the ramen.  We ordered fried chicken, gyoza and a side of veggies. The fried chicken they had to bring us another piece cos they dropped it or something, and the veggies-mainly all the cabbages had a black line on all the sides.  I had to pick out the ones which looked more edible, I still had more than 70% of the veggies dish inedible."}
{"text":"I don't usually write review but I had to express my disappointment for the dinner I had today. Honestly I haven't been to any kinton for a very long time, but I still remember the joy when I had my first bowl of decent ramen 3-4 years ago. And the ramen I had today failed the name of kinton. The Japanese  instant ramen that I could get from T&T tastes better than this. The soup base is just salty and without its rich pork bone taste that it supposed to have. The noodles weren't cook nicely. And it's just waste bad."}
{"text":"Great ramen' I opted for the vegetarian option and my hubby chose the special ramen. They were both very good. I especially love the tofu furai which contains carrots, tofu, and other veggies. It tasted like nuggets but very good! I also love the black sesame soy pudding (a must have). The matcha cheesecake is ok.   The staff was nice. I did find one small piece of plastic packaging of ramen in my soup and the manager apologized and offered to take it off the menu as it was my birthday."}
{"text":"After trying nearby Ryu's ramen and finding it wanting, and another time going to Konichiwa because the line at Kinton was out the door, we finally made it inside after a tolerable 15 min. wait. It was tolerable because we'd just come from the Santa Claus parade and had the folding stools we'd brought w/ us.  Had the rich shoyu ramen w/ pork belly and regular shio ramen w/ pork shoulder. Both were very good w/ nice depth of flavor. Not quite as complex as Santouka, but worlds better than Ryu. The pork was unctuous and tender and the soft boiled egg picked up the flavor of the soup and added a creamy richness to an already rich broth. The noodles were perfectly chewy and al dente.   Also had karaage because I can't say no to fried chicken. This is a must order and the included mayo based dipping sauce went well with it.   Seating on stools is tight so hang your coat up on the rack up front."}
{"text":"Had the karaage, spicy garlic ramen and Asian delight tea. The karaage was fine, but skimpy for $5.80. The ramen was filling, but the spicy garlic broth and the noodles were just ok. The Asian delight tea was good."}
{"text":"Given the fact that everyone is raving about it, I set high expectation for Guu's ramen shop.  Overall it taste good, the seasoned egg can be hotter as it was served slightly warm only.  Liked the option of choosing pork shoulder or belly & regular soup or lighter soup.  No wait at lunch & food is serve very fast!"}
{"text":"Wasn't anything special.   I  had the spicy pork ramen noodles that was just ok.  Others at our table had the pork ramen with think noodles and two chicken with thin noodles.   All of ours were ok, nothing really special.   We did have very good service."}
{"text":"Good ramen, prices higher than in the USA, but tasty. The extra 2$ combo was worth it to fill up."}
{"text":"Came by this little place for a hot bowl of noodles after snowboarding for a day! Saturday night, surprisingly not as busy as I thought but it could be the weather. Anyway, we waited 15 mins for a table; for those of you who have never been here before, there is NO waiting space. Super limited seating. But the good thing is turnover is fast. Staff on the whole are quite friendly.  We ordered the original and also the miso this time. Though the miso was light, it felt thicker than the original broth regular. Anyway, ramen was cooked al dente just the way I like it. The gyoza came after the noodles (we ordered a combo each). They did not disappoint, but my only negative comment was as good as that mayo was, I did not appreciate it drenched over my gyoza. Perhaps if they drizzle less or just serve it on the side it might be better. Anyway all in all it was a good meal. The noodles are delicious! But if only the place was a bit bigger and not mostly bar seating it would be even better :)"}
{"text":"This review is for the original ramen with the age gyoza combo for 12.99$. I am a huge noodles/pasta fan. Their ramen is delicious but compared to bloor chain, this locAtion's broth seems less thick, although more people preferred the thicker broth, I like the lighter more as it doesn't tired u so much with their packed of the flavour, I picked the thick noodles over the thin noodles, adding pork and nori on top= to perfection in my opinion, anything else u want to add in ur bowl, it will be extra money.   In my opinion, the bowl of noodles is quite small, I feel like Ajisen Ramen have a bigger portion, therefore I wasn't filled with the combo at all and I'm just a girl lol.... nonetheless, it was delicious so I won't complain too much about the size.   The gyoza was very juicy and delicious served over some orangey sauce with gives it a lil kick. I really like it and this is a regular portion instead of a smaller portion for their side dish with their ramen combo   The decor of this place is nice, staff greet u loudly and clearly to welcome their guest and say good bye loudly when u leave their restaurant. The bad thing about this place is the sitting, their small table for 2 is uncomfortable and their chair are all hard so my bum bum hurt lol... but I guess they are trying to aim that Japanese theme...  I heard they have Tuesday special for 5$ a bowl or something? I have yet to witness it myself.  Updating this in the future :)"}
{"text":"The atmosphere was lively, fun, and modern (like Guu next door) but the food wasn't as exciting.  I ordered the combo with Ramen and pork ta ta da (sp) side dish.  The side dish arrived immediately; it looked like a can of cat food on rice with green onion garnish, but it tasted ok.  The ramen took half an hour to arrive, which is surprising given there's essentially 2 menu options of soup that is likely prepared in a large batch.  The ramen was ok; it didn't seem like anything special.  I'll probably just make Mr. Noodle next time, or go to Guu next door."}
{"text":"Good Ramen and vibe, but seating is limited and tight. Not a good date spot, but great spot to dine alone or book in advance for a group table at the back. The welcoming was not genuine as the servers can get cranky."}
{"text":"I dined at Kinton Ramen twice.  I was impressed by the overall package that Kinton offered both times.    Greeting - Upon entry, customers are greeted loudly, literally, by all staffs in sight (insert shocked face meme).    Ambience -  The venue is beautiful, spacious, well lighted and clean.  I really like the wooden wall.  It is modern looking yet the wood material echoes the tradition.  The high ceiling creates an airy feelings.  Kinton is by far the best looking ramen joint in Richmond Hills.    Food - I ordered the Original Pork thin ramen in one visit, and the Chicken Spicy thick ramen in the other.  The broths of both selections were delicious and not too salty, which I really liked.  The chicken broth was thick, had depth, slightly spicy, yet tasted so balanced.  It might look oily, but it didn't feel oily.  The chicken ramen also came with a few pieces (four?) of quality chicken breast meat.  The pork ramen was photogenic.  The pork broth was intensely flavoured.  There were 2 big slices of pork.  The portions of both ramen were good, with the pork ramen a bigger bowl.  I preferred the chicken broth over the pork broth however.  Both thin and thick ramen had a slight firmness when I bit into them (al dente).  They were fresh, smooth and filling.  They didn't have the slight bounce that the Sansotei ramen was famous for.    Services - Friendly, helpful and efficient services.    Other food - deep fried chicken was all right.    Departure - Be prepared for an enthusiastic farewell from all staff upon exit (insert embarrassing smile meme).  Opening late to 10:30pm, Kinton is quickly becoming my favourite ramen joint in the Markham/Richmond Hill area."}
{"text":"We have been here a couple of times. The first time we went was during their soft opening and the service was not great along with serving us bowls of ramen that have been clearly sitting in the kitchen for some time. We decided to give it another try. The food was very good, however, it took over 20 minutes for the food to arrive. We did appreciate that the server told us this when we ordered. Overall, the service was still not great. We ordered the miso pork with thin noodles and added extra chicken (pork is much tastier than the chicken). I highly recommend the Gyukai Tonkotsu Tsukemen! The fish and pork broth was so rich and paired perfect with their thick noodles. Also, they only serve a limited number of these each day. I also like the pork spicy garlic, broth is very flavourful and not too spicy."}
{"text":"First time at this location. Service was much better than some of their other locations. Servers were friendly and ramen arrived around 15 minutes after ordering. Today we tried the February special, Tonkotsu Kara Miso Ramen which had a nice spicy broth, thick noodles, pork, half soft boiled egg, corn and egg. Great for people who like it spicy. We also got the spicy garlic which had the same level of spiciness as the special. This location is fairly small and there was a short lineup during lunch on a Monday. Also, I think there is only street parking."}
{"text":"3.5*   Pretty decent ramen, flavours are good and the staff has been nothing but friendly the times I've been. From the other reviews I do see how the service may be lacking at times, but it Is a new restaurant. Overall, food was good, service was good. No complaints here"}
{"text":"While we're thrilled to finally have ramen in Scarborough, this location currently isn't up to par with its downtown counterparts. Service is undergoing growing pains, pork is on the dry side, while appetizers and deserts are an afterthought: overly greasy gyoza and dry matcha cheesecake. Still, they've just opened, and we hope they'll sort out the kinks upon our return. Best wishes."}
{"text":"I miss hanging here but today's service is horrible. Never coming back again. Horrible hostess even though wait staff try to accommodate when we tried to move to a table. Horrible hostess!!"}
{"text":"2.5 stars.  OK so I was SUUUUPER psyched for this .. just because i'm a huge ramen freak and can't seem to find a huge selection of ramen shops in the Toronto downtown area. I frequent Kenzo alot, but that's about it. And the portions at Guu are too small. So I read the reviews, anticipated the opening, and even lined up outside for 15 minutes.   It's not terrible? But for the hype and price, I wouldn't come back again. The number one thing being the extreme fattiness of the soup-base.   Upon trying it, it smelled delicious! The atmosphere is cute (like kintaro in vancouver) where you sit on the counter and witness everything. The staff was friendly and efficient and very japanese/ramen like. The wait time wasn't atrocious.   I ordered the shiyo base with extra corn, and my bf had the extra extra pork for $12.50 (all it is is just extra pork). It's GOOD .. i mean, but not really excellent. I ordered the shoulder and it came out REALLY fatty ... the sizes are generous. but it was really too much ... fat.   oh and we got kind of sick. :( intestine wise :(  Would much prefer kenzo!"}
{"text":"I tend to frequent this location because 1) it's one of the more spacious locations and I don't feel cramped and I can enjoy my food. 2) my boyfriend is in love with ramen probably more than me lol. My two favourite things on the menu are the Spicy Garlic Pork Ramen with thick noodles, add egg, and maybe corn and butter if I'm feeling fancy and the Original Pork. Both are great with good flavours and the pork is very good. The chicken on the other hand tastes good but in all honesty the portion size of such in my experience has never been on par with the pork. As well, they have changed their bowl sizes in which they are smaller. Not by much but it still makes a difference. This can be good or bad depending on who you are. For myself, I usually can never finish the bowl and rely on my boyfriend for finishing it for my bowler stamp (cheating I know sorry) but now it's just enough that I can finish it. But for my hungry hungry friends it's not necessarily a good thing. Their appetizers are great without a doubt, but quite a bit pricey for the amounts you get. Still will be back"}
{"text":"My favourite ramen spot in the city. I've had some pretty memorable meals here, and our go-to is always the following: a) a bowl of shio ramen, b) a bowl of spicy garlic ramen, both with pork shoulder, and c) an order of their delicious gyoza.  We've always visited at off-peak hours - around 5:00 PM for dinner or later in the evening, around 9:00 PM, just to avoid the lines that inevitably form. Seating is very limited, with a mishmash of communal tables and separate individual tables. Spacing is very cramped, but nonetheless, the food is delicious. These are the best gyoza I've had in Toronto to date, and I often order a second round just to satisfy the cravings (I've been known to eat two orders of gyoza in one sitting...). The ramen itself is wonderfully light but full-bodied in flavour, with noodles well-cooked, and the meat very, very tender. I like the extra dashes of uniqueness you can add to your bowl, such as extra green onions, sweet corn, among other options.  Service can be a bit slow, but other than that, I'll continue coming back here (or it's other sister locations) both for my ramen and gyoza fix."}
{"text":"I've been to Kinton 1 before and this is clearly far less superior.  I ordered my pork ramen with nitamago, corn, nori, and pork slices. For the appetizer, I ordered the takoyaki.  Honestly, the ramen bowl was a bit like the Kardashians. Overhyped but not that great.   The superstar of the bowl, the soup, lacked the depths of pork bones that had been simmered for hours in a pot. It didn't have enough seasoning and tasted like porky, oily water. No savoriness, no sweetness, no creaminess of the melted fat when you sip the soup. It was bland, disappointingly bland.  The nitamago, while perfectly cooked, was not marinated enough to soak up the flavor of soy sauce and mirin.  The pork belly tasted like overcooked pork chops. It was so dry, so empty (like my soul). I expected to bite into milky melty pork belly fatness and I got cardboard instead. What happened to the fat, you ask? It all went to the Kardashian's bums.  The noodles were good. Cooked al dente and springy with every bite. There's also the takoyaki which was piping hot, deliciously tangy/savory, and had a nice portion of octopus meat and soft pancakey batter in the center.  Overall, I'd probably not go to this Kinton again."}
{"text":"This place has changed ramen for me for good!! I always come here when I'm in the neighborhood and it never disappoints. I love their drink selection as they have fun and interesting drinks which is always great, and the food is out of this world! Try the hot karaage and black shio ramen!"}
{"text":"This is a cozy little place located in the Ryerson University area. I'll admit that my only previous experience with ramen has been the instant stuff they sell in supermarkets. I was pretty excited to try the authentic stuff.  The server we had very friendly and everyone who leaves after they're done eating gets a friendly cheer from the staff. I ordered thick ramen noodles in soy sauce with chicken and extra sweet corn. My girlfriend got the same combo but with thin noodles. They did forget to leave out the seasoned egg that she didn't want and forgot to add some extra jalapeño powder. We both felt that the broth was very tasty but could have been warmer especially on a cold night like this. Overall I'd come to this place again if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Came here during my weekend trip to Montreal for the Rogers Cup. This place is great!   Order the wide ramen. It's really the normal size your used to. I'll post the picture of what I orders. I added extra noodles. I was hungry and it was a better choice than getting more meat.    The vibe is cool. Great place to hangout. Staff is friendly and the price is right."}
{"text":"Highly over hyped for what it is. Came here on a Sunday night with no line, which was surprising to be honest. Ordered 2 bowls and ramen - spicy garlic and miso chicken. Came pretty quick, which was pretty good. I kid you not, the place came with 3 pieces of chicken breast strips that were tiny. Soup was bland but the noodles were pretty good. For the prices that they're charging customers for a simple bowl of ramen did not match the quality. Would not return and very unhappy lol."}
{"text":"I must've tried every popular ramen spot in the city and I have to say, authentic or not, nothing is as tasty as the ramen offerings here.  The only issues I have are outside of the food itself, if you want the best tasting ramen in Toronto and that's all you're looking for, please look no further. However, if you're looking for a date, family or chatting with a friend spot, I'd look somewhere else.   The atmosphere here isn't the greatest to have a conversation in. The upbeat music and loud greetings from the staff will have you repeating sentences to your company through out the meal. Not to mention the space is incredibly tiny. You'll be hard pressed to find seating right away, and you may have to sit at a communal table - which may be an issue for some.  The service is average most nights, there's nothing particularly negative or positive about it. The food comes relatively quickly with no hassle and the men and women who work there seem to enjoy what they do.  Again, if you're looking for top-notch tasting ramen in the GTA - the bottom line is you have to try Kinton out."}
{"text":"Love stopping by for a bowl of Ramen, service is great, soup is good and although the place is small, I've never waited more than 20 mins for a table. its a quick eat, Gyoza are nothing special, but I enjoy the spicy Kage (fried chicken) and the Lemonade/sapporo drink."}
{"text":"We came here for lunch since we were just nearby. But the service really made me speechless :(  We ordered Chicken original ramen with extra veggies / pork original ramen / takoyaki.   The food came rather fast, which is not bad. But they actually forgot my chicken breast pieces in the \"Chicken original ramen\". I mean, practically every ramen bowl on the menu has a type of protein, I'd think it's part of the workflow, how it is even possible to forget? Anyway, we sat at the ramen bar so I just asked one of the chef (?), who looked very apologetic after hearing this BUT told me \"all they can do\" is to bring me the chicken breast as the side dish, and I can consume them like that. I said ok, didn't want to make a fuss about it. The two thinly sliced chicken breasts was presented on a very small white shallow dipping bowl, which made it looked extra lonely and cheap.. which I should've taken another photo of.. but anyway, it's not hard to imagine.  I wouldn't be surprised if only the pork ramen tasted very MSG, and my chicken ramen tasted rather plain (which I highly suspect the MSG was forgotten as well) but chicken ramen without chicken, really?  We paid full price with tips at the end, didn't want to be ah..."}
{"text":"Stopped by on a rainy Saturday for lunch.  It was quite crowded, even at 2pm, but we were seated right away.  Tried the regular pork ramen (with an extra egg as we were sharing), the gyoza and the Scottish egg.  The soup was a nice milky smooth and tasty broth.  The Chashu and pork belly were perfectly cooked...the pork belly was melt in your mouth delicious.  The gyoza was crispy and smothered in some mayonnaise based sauce, which I didn't care for.  I prefer steamed and pan fried on one side with some soy/vinegar or ponzu sauce instead of a heavy mayo based sauce..  My favorite dish was their Scottish Egg.  Nice fried shell with a ground/ minced pork layer and in the middle, an egg salad mixture.  If nothing else, you gotta try the Scottish egg.  You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I have tried Momofuku Noodle Bar, Ippudo's, Kenzo (North York), Aijisen, and Shinsengumi.    Please do not let the Guu like atmosphere confuse you with quality food & wow factor.    I ordered all three ramens from the menu with reg soup and pork belly.  The pork belly was so tough it almost ripped my teeth out ...   Soup base (Miso, Shoyu, Shio) were all so bland.  The place has no AC, and they only have one table at the back that can hold 7 peeps.  I understand the traditional concept of ramen joints are bar like quick in and out type of restaurants, but my food took 20 mins!  This place sucks! After my meal I said to myself...Really?! People lined up for this Sh*t?!  I gave them one star for value and one star for sympathy.  Can not believe people are raving about this place, but then again Torontonian's are still new to the ramen scene.  Once David Chang open's up shop in T.O. I'm sure Yelper will understand what I'm talking about."}
{"text":"We came here for lunch after taking a break from Black Friday shopping.  Customer service was awful. There were many tables for two but Kinton refused to serve is because they were trying to wait for a table of six to clear so they can serve the group of six in front.  It makes absolutely no sense why you cannot serve other customers first.   Food came at a reasonable time but it can't make up for the long waiting time to be seated.  I will stick with going to the location at Yonge and Eg."}
{"text":"Amazing ramen shop in a convenient location. My husband and I have been to Japan many times, and this place is as close as we've gotten to authentic ramen and true Japanese style service. It is fairly priced, and totally worth the money. One of our favourite spots in the Yonge and Eg area."}
{"text":"Amazing ramen restaurant on Church Street. It is a great atmosphere the workers greet you when you come and when you leave. Staff is very attentive even when it got busy around 9 on a Thursday. In town on business and will stop I'm again. The ramen is great taste and filling. Also be sure to get a few sake sours bartend was very busy but still managed to get me drinks in great time."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time since a location opened up close to home. We tried the spicy karrage and gyoza. Both pretty good appetizers - gyoza was really yummy  Had the spicy garlic pork ramen and original pork ramen. The broth on the original pork was rich but very very bland - even the seasoning in the shaker didn't help. The noodles itself were yummy though! And everything else was good  Not the best ramen I've ever had but I would come back again to try the other ramen bowls - hope the others have more taste !"}
{"text":"I think this place was great before but it seems like many ramen shops start strong and then the food quality slides. The meat in the noodles seems dry and overcooked - they just blast it with the torch prior to putting it in the bowl so it seems fresher."}
{"text":"We went at weird time (2 pm) so we didn't have to wait, but the place was still full.   The music was insanely loud, the noodlies were on the chewy side (You may prefer this) and the broth seemed a bit mild (You may also prefer this)  Did I mention the music was loud?   I'd probably take Kenzo only because its quieter, less chance of a wait, and the food quality is a draw as far as I'm concerned."}
{"text":"Where to begin with Kinton? There's definitely some highs, and definitely some lows.  The highs? Upon entering you are greeted with a loud welcome, like in Japan. We were seated quickly with next to no delay. The menu includes a variety of styles of ramen from Japan, and a decent selection of side dishes.  When our ramen was served it was handed to is cheerfully by a server. My date had a traditional pork broth ramen, while I tried the special of the month. My bowl of ramen was served cold (it was meant to be that way), and the noodles were definitely reminiscent of what I had in Japan, and it was a decent sized bowl.   The lows? While nothing major in itself, the combination of everything is what brought my review lower. My ramen was served with out a spoon, and it would have been good if they actually noted my ramen was meant to be cold. For the uninitiated, they may be surprised that their bowl of noodles was cold and not hot. My dates bowl of ramen seemed to be a lot smaller then mine, and they don't seem to have sizes for their bowls, so not sure why the size difference when we both paid the same, and she just got a basic cha shu ramen. The seats are basically all stools, with some seating with backing, and you can hang your coats in the front. I can sort of understand the design choice as in Japan, all the ramen shops are like this nearly, where you have to walk in single file, get a counter seat and eat. You also hang your stuff up under you, or right behind you, since you can't put a jacket on a stool. But with all the space in this place, I don't think the stool design choice really works. We also had to ask 3 servers for the bill when it wasn't a full restaurant. Also our karaage came out burnt, which really tipped the ice burg.   Overall I would come back, as I do believe that all these misgivings were maybe an \"off day\". But this place wouldn't be at the very top of my list to recommend for now"}
{"text":"This place is bomb. I came in sat down within seconds. Ordered within seconds. Received my dishes within minutes. Everything was hot and fresh. Like as I'm writing this review my ramen and chicken karage is steaming!  Tried the gyoza, chicken karage & miso pork ramen. They were literally all a major hit 10/10. I'm so glad they opened right across from where I live. Few minutes away and it's amazing. Everything was so tasty. They deserve a 5 star for sure! Some of these reviews are so inacurate and negative that it makes u second guess to even go here...just ignore it trust me."}
{"text":"This place is legit ramen if you're not in the downtown core. Had the pork ramen with miso and thick noodles, and it was great. I think I would come back to this place just for the miso.  Limited seating with long lines so prepare to wait. All in all definitely one of the better places to have ramen."}
{"text":"It's famous ramen place in Toronto, so I expected too much I guess. It was salty, and not better than other ramen places. Service was not bad, but food was not that good. I'd try the other location."}
{"text":"It's been almost four years since I had Kinton ramen at their original location on Baldwin street. I was very excited when I heard they they were finally coming to Montreal! With the weather back down to the lower single digits (felt like -1c at noon today, in May :s), what better way to warm up than having a bowl of ramen and some spicy and crunchy karaage! The broth was full bodied with lots of flavourful, the fatty pork belly cooked to perfection, adding even more flavour to the bowl. Karaage was crunchy, tender and bathed in a spicy and sour sauce. If only the sauce was lighter on the salt, it would've been perfect for my taste. Overall, a good experience."}
{"text":"Nice little ramen place on Bishop. It's the sister of Kinka Izakaya on St Catherine's and Guy cause it's the same owner. The vibe and decor show that they're definitely related!   The staff all greet you when you come in with words of welcome. The only other place where I'd ever been greeted by all the staff in a resto was at Bonaparte. The waiters are very polite and attentive.   We ordered a bunch of tapas for a light and quick dinner starting with the Tako Wasabi.  It's a cute plate where you spoon a small amount of marinated octopus with wasabi stems into tiny sheets of nori, fold them over to form a little roll and eat it. It has a soft wasabi kick to it. It was a bit too salty though.  Then we had the Goma Salad Ramen. The ramen was al dente with crispy lettuce, corn nibblets, etc. and a light sesame dressing. Topped with very finely shredded dried red bell peppers.   Karaage Original was done just right. Light crispy seasoned exterior and tender interior. Tastes like Asian KFC :) Drizzled with lemon and served with garlic mayo on the side.   Tofu Furai you must try. (Cause it rhymes) These 4 tofu nuggets tasted like juicy chicken nuggets!!  The sweet and sour spicy sauce and scallions all pair well with the tofu.   Matcha cheese cake was light and smooth. Perfect to finish the meal.  Tapas were whipped out in no time at all. We were able to eat and leave in less than an hour. Overall a nice place. I didn't try the traditional ramen so I'll have to go back!  Price wise, I find it a little expensive for the tapas, hence the four stars."}
{"text":"Awesome place for ramen!  Came to meet a friend for dinner and was told that I can't get a seat until the entire party is present.  Wasn't used to this but I understand where they are coming from especially when they have people waiting.  More turnover means more money!  Was able to get seated eventually and pretty much squeezed into a table where a group was seated.  It looks like they have 1 big table up front that holds 8 and counter/bar seating down the entire restaurant.  Had the ramen with extra meat ($15) with mixed meat, regular broth and spicy flavor.   It took some time for the ramen to come out after being ordered so that kind of sucked.  Most ramen places are quick.  BUT...it was worth the wait.  The food was delicious!  Noodles were nice and firm, the pork was good and the broth was excellent!  Apparently, if you finish the noodles and soup, you get to be on their Facebook page as a \"Kinton Bowler\"!  I pretty much had it finished but opted out - chickened out to be exact.  Not looking for the publicity.  The service was ok.  I think they spend a lot of time going outside to call people in and sometimes forget about the people dining at the front.  Didn't even have anyone come and see how we were making out with the food.  The restaurant is trendy and modern.  Just a warning to those that don't like stairs, you have to go downstairs to use the bathroom.  I would definitely come again."}
{"text":"The ramen here is really good and you can personalize it! There's different broths and different type of noodles to pick from. It is a bit pricy for ramen thought (in my opinion). They also have a loyalty card, so it's pretty cool if you go often.  Other than that, the inside of the restaurant is very nice and clean (the washroom too! They are actually really nice!).  Finally, it's a bit small so if there's a long line, be prepared to wait for quite some time...."}
{"text":"We gave this place a try since it was the highest rated one we could find.  Went with a combo which came with a bowl of ramen & your choice & a rice bowl with either chopped chicken or pork.  Also u could top your ramen w/a seasoned egg and jalapeño paste, both sounded great, but didn't really add much taste at all.  The noodles were supposed to be thin but were much thicker than I'm used to.  The pork was really good tho as well as the spicy kara age.  I would come back for that spicy fried chicken for sure."}
{"text":"My first visit to kinton and honestly it was amazing. I got the IT special; two slice of pork belly, two soft boiled egg halves, and a takoyaki with some thick noodles. It was delicious. The pork was torched and had a great smokiness, the soup was well balanced and a rich miso flavour. The takoyaki was the best I've had so far in Toronto.   We also got the gyoza which was out of this world. It didn't have that slight aftertaste of porkiness like a lot of places do. It was a fresh, clean taste on the palate.  We also had the matcha cheesecake. Silky and smooth, it was a nice balance of soft sweetness and cheesecake saltiness. The taste of the bitter matcha softly sitting on your tongue.  The staff was very welcoming and great. They were friendly, and the food came very fast.  I recommend this on your next visit."}
{"text":"I dined at Kinton Ramen twice. The first time I ate here was because of all the hype from my friends.  They were saying it was so good. I got the pork ramen with miso flavour. I chose the pork broth and pork meat and thin noodles.  I usually like miso flavoured stuff and went for the miso base.  The miso flavoured came with soya bean paste, bean sprouts, scallions, nori.  I opt out of the beansprouts because I'm not a fan of them.  I was not allowed to replace beansprouts for a different topping without additional cost.  The pork was really good (just one long piece) , however, there were so few toppings and felt like I was just eating plain noodle.  I wasn't able to finish my food because it tasted so plain from the lack of toppings it came with.   My next visit was with my coworkers.  My coworkers wanted to go Kinton after work because it was close by.  I was planning on just getting a drink.  I was getting hungry and thought \"forget it, maybe I'll like this ramen more then last time\".  So I ordered the pork broth, pork meat, thin noodles and original flavour (sea salt, beansprouts, scallion, nori, seasoned egg).  Again, I opt out of the beansprouts.  And was not able to finish the food again cause it lacked toppings and tasted plain.   I usually like ramen, but Kinton is just not for me.  Maybe I would have enjoyed it more if I added extra toppings to my ramen."}
{"text":"**3.5 stars** (I give overall a 3/5 because the line is not worth it the next time).  Sooooo finally found some time to check this out after breaking the promise to myself to visit during their opening week.  As we walked down Baldwin looking for Kinton, we peeked at the plates of patio dwellers of other restaurants.  Then at the end of the street, I noticed something and said, \"That must be it, the one with the line out front.\"  We were quoted an hour's wait, so decided to grab a drink at the sushi patio next door.  We were sat in under an hour in the deep narrow restaurant where there is one communal table out front, a long bar in the middle over looking the open kitchen and workers, and 2 more tables at the back.  I was so happy to see fresh ramen noodles being cooked in front of me, but so sad that they have not yet acquired their liquor license.    Cheese Ramen: $9-10?? (3.5 stars) I love cheese and I love ramen, I have no excuse to not order this!  I opted for the pork belly instead of pork butt because... well, fat=flavour right?  I watched as the shredded swiss is generously mounded on my heaping bowl of fresh noodles, and whispered, \"Ooohhh Yeaaahhh\".  The light miso broth is pretty good, but a tad salty (possibly due to the addition of cheese).  The noodles are better than Kenzo's though.  What I was really disappointed with was the ONE piece of pork belly!! Since when was ONE piece of bacon ever enough?!?!  Shio Ramen: $9.50 (4/5 stars) Sea salted broth (light, as oppose to rich... whatever that meant as an option), served with pork butt slices, a soft boiled egg and nori.  The broth was okay, but the noodles was delish once again!  The egg perfectly cooked as the whites were firm to enclose the delicate yolk that seeps out once you break it... Mmm.  Then this is where I go, \"this is NOT FAIR!\".  Although we are given the choice of either pork shoulder or pork belly, they come in different amounts.  If you get pork belly, you get one thick piece, if you get pork shoulder, you get 4-5 thick slices.  Hmmm.....??  Spicy Chicken Karaage: $4something (3/5 stars) Incredibly juicy and loved the batter, but at the end of the day, it's just pieces of fried dark meat chicken with some spicy sauce.    Service: (4/5 stars) A little slow with the arrival of the first dish.  Greeted with the attitudes of Guu as everyone is being sat, each order was shouted harmoniously as each dish came up to the pass.  Our server didn't really speak English but got by.  They were all very attentive and patient.  Since we were one of the last tables to be sat, we were also the last to leave.  Right till the very end, all the staff showed so much enthusiasm and greeted us goodbye as if we were their first customers.  I like their noodles a lot, but I like Kenzo's broth better.  Comparing the atmosphere between the two would be like comparing apples to oranges, so I won't even bother.  I am definitely coming back to Kinton for their beer cocktails once they have their LLBO, but I think my go-to is still Kenzo just because it's a bit more relaxed, more options, and rarely a wait."}
{"text":"$5.18 for any ramen!? Yes please !   We came here during their every 6th year promotion- $5.18 for any ramen ! Are we crazy ? Yes ! But was it worth the wait? Ohhh yahhh !   We arrived 6ish on the Friday ! The line was pretty crazy- there were at least 60 people infront of us. From our surprise , we actually got seated in the store within an hour!  The waitress got us at a 2 seated table (party of 2) . The place was obviously very busy but all they staffs were working very hard to maintain a speedy & super friendly service. WOHOoo for the LOVELY service!!!!   I ordered the original chicken broth with thick noodles with extra noodles  ( additional $1.9) ... I was hangry ! So I really needed my carbs!  We got our noodles pretty quickly! On mine it comes with a seasoned egg, nori, two pieces of chicken breast, scallions and noodles ! The broth itself was pretty well seasoned, but it was a little too salty for my liking. The chicken was surprisingly tender. Chicken breast are usually dried and tough to eat. Prompts for that ! Everything tasted very well together  ! That was definitely a hearty bowl of noodles ! Nom nom nom ! :9  Would I revisit this place ? Oh yaahhh!"}
{"text":"My favourite spot for ramen and a beer! Highly recomend the Miso Ramen with pork shoulder and rich soup. Cheap too! Under $15 for beer and noodles!"}
{"text":"Okay, I've been ordering the same thing here: double chicken with the seasoned egg (which is GODLY btw), and my opinion of this place is unchanged! Supreme broth, awesome product. This is a fabulous place for food - good date place!"}
{"text":"Smaller establishment but I love this restaurant. Ramen is legit. I would avoid coming with a big group though. There's not enough tables/seats."}
{"text":"Don't get why people rave so much about the pork shoulder and the ramen but here was my disappointing experience at Kinton which i would liken to biting into a delicious looking red apple only to find it rotten and wormy.   My friend and I entered Kinton after a long and hard workout, we were starving and were looking forward to it as I had read the reviews and one of my close friends had also strongly reccomended it. We ordered the tonkotsu (classic) and the miso broth ramen with thick noodles and pork shoulder. I even ordered extra meat as my friend said the meat was \"so good\".   All this raving made it that when we got our ramen and tasted I wasn't even sure that we were eating at the same place that everyone was talking about! The broth tasted watered down, not even with broth but with literal water and the lard added to it made it unpleasant. It was not luxurious and smooth savory broth but sad, thin and pale very much like my gran.   The noodles kind of stuck together and lacked a chew, they were a bit soggy. Finally was the centrepiece of the meal, the pork shoulder. Everyone talks about how tender and delicious it was, those people have palates made out of lead. It was dry and burnt, period.  Overall a disappointing experience and I paid 20 dollars with tips for this bowl of sadness 1/5 stars for food + another because I really like the authentic look of the place and the friendly Japanese servers but if someone made me choose death by shooting or another bowl of Kinton I'd choose the bullet."}
{"text":"This place is currently run by amateurs. Visited for Sunday lunch, excited to try the first ramen place in Toronto where parking isn't an... ordeal.   Waited way too long to be seated, which would be understandable on a Sunday afternoon if only there weren't a bunch of empty seats clearly visible. Laughable dining-room-Tetris skills from the host.   Ordered a Pork Shoyu w/ extra noodles which came half an hour too late and completely devoid of pork. Flagged down the chef. Admitted he forgot to add protein. Hands me 2 measly slices of pork on a small plate.  Casually observing the patrons around me, I witnessed an elderly party getting a completely wrong order of food and a younger couple who didn't receive their side order of wings until well after they were both done their noodles.  Ramen was mediocre at best. Nothing to write home about and definitely not worth $12.99.  Kinton Scarborough wait and kitchen staff: get your act together. As a fan of the Bloor location, I'm not mad just disappointed."}
{"text":"Opened not too long ago. Went to try it out with the hubby since we live walking distance to it. Could have long line ups at times since its still new in the area. No liquor license yet."}
{"text":"The one star is for consistency in food. Spicy garlic ramen with thick noodles were good.  One table had split their water and the girl that was cleaning up, wiping the floor with paper towels decides to set a table with chopsticks and napkins without washing her hands - THAT'S SO GROSS! It's been opened for a couple of months and this place is sooo dirty, I didn't even want to put my umbrella on their dirty floor! I hope their kitchen is cleaner!  Process needs improvement. We ordered two appetitizers, two ramens with a side of gyoza. We received our ramens first, and half way through finishing them, we asked for our spicy karage and tako wasabi to be followed up. We finished our ramens before we receiving our first appetitizer. LOL. We then had to follow up again with our tako wasabi - that requires no cooking, so what the heck? GET YOUR ORDERS IN CHECK.  Will not return. I agree with other reviews, amateurs."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Amazing chicken broth that you can't find anywhere else! I'm usually very picky when it comes to eating out.  They make everything fresh in front of you...and again the broth is to die for!"}
{"text":"Good food. Nice decor. Fast service.   The broth (original and garlic) very rich and the pork melts on your mouth! The service was excellent, as our server was wonderful and food came quickly.  The first problem I had was the small portion sizes for $11+ but the main thing about the place that ticked me off and lost 2* was the fact that they DID NOT HAVE AC ON DURING A 40 DEGREE WEATHER. WHAT THE FUDGE?! we almost freaking melted eating the hot ass ramen and bolted out asap to seek cooler environments."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of Kinton Ramen. I know they have a bunch of locations sprouting up, but they have a formula and it works dammit! This is no exception. After several visits I can say their ramen is consistent with other locations. Tasty and soaked in flavour.  The only drawback are the growing pains of being a new location. Case in point, delays when ordering and getting order's mixed up. This only seemed to happen the first few times I went and has since cleared up.  They have a really good takeout system in place. Everything is separated and comes with a bowl large enough to eat out of when you haul it back to work. There's no reason why you can't get your Ramen fix several times a week now!  Their other offerings are also well made. The Takoyaki was especially amazing! Soft and covered in saucy goodness."}
{"text":"Been to Kinton several times now and they don't disappoint.  Quality is consistent, service is good. The restaurant itself is always quite rowdy so I do go by myself sometimes to channel my inner ramen-loving soul [also it is a shorter wait time for one].   Their creative ramen: garlic and cheese is definitely worth a try. Gotten the garlic almost three times now and its always delicious and leaves subtle flavour in your mouth for you to reminisce until your next meal.  If you've never been, you should. If you've been and didn't like it, I do understand. Personally I think it's worth the hype and wait."}
{"text":"Main differences between Kinton 1 and Kinton 2: - Kinton 2 offers a wide range of chicken based ramen (shio, shoyu, spicy, miso) - Can choose between thick and thin noodles - Kinton 2 does not offer vegetable ramen (sad face) - Kinton 2 is spacer than Kinton 1  For me, Kinton 2 just doesn't provide the familiarity and and friendliness of Kinton 1. My favourite vegetable ramen has disappeared from the menu. Although it is not a popular choice, it is definitely my must order at Kinton 1 since I often feel overwhelmed by pork chasu and pork stock. I went with my usual, spicy garlic ramen with thick noodles. The thick noodles are a tad thicker than the regular noodles at kinton 1 and is a bit chewer. The soup, in this case, was a huge disappointment. It lacked flavour and definitely was not what I'm used to at Kinton 1.   The music is now even louder, and the service not as good... There are definitely some improving to be done.  EDIT: I ordered the lunch combo when I went on a saturday... the pork gyoza was 90% pulled out of a frozen package. Stay away."}
{"text":"Saw it opening soon for a while and they finally opened for lunch now. Came here with colleague for lunch today and it was pretty packed. Taste is good as usual and my colleagues were impressed. Taking one star off as we see empty tables but staff could have cleaned it up sooner and settle us at a table first from waiting at the door."}
{"text":"This place is quite good, but I'm not too knowledgable about ramen noodles. It is a fun place to go for dinner, but I would not recommend going here for a hungover lunch (re: extremely loud. This isn't a bad thing at dinner time though in my opinion)  My favourite dish is the spicy garlic ramen, and if you like spice and garlic, I'm sure it will be yours too.  I have been twice now and would go back again.  The staff were very nice and helpful, and the decor is quite nice in there as well.  Also, quite reasonably priced for what you get."}
{"text":"I think maybe 3 years ago, this would have gotten a 4 from me. There are just too many ramen shops around town now. But I will point out that the food here is good. I do come here pretty regularly. There's just something different about the place that I can't put my finger on it (from how it was 3 years ago). The atmosphere, the vibe, just seems different walking into it now than from before.  Oh and also, the menu used to be constructed so that I could walk in and say pork belly, spicy garlic broth, rich or regular (a three step process). Now it's a 6 or 7 step process. I don't know how I feel about this paradox of choice. I'm an eater not a thinker.  But anyway, I consider ramen soul food for some reason (anything in broth/soup is soul food to me =). And so I can always go and eat a bowl or ramen. And that's probably why I do eat here regularly. I like their spicy garlic soup the most (and in fact, I'm sure I haven't had any of the other soup)...I don't like change. If it works and if it makes me happy, I stick with it. It's not spicy, by the way. It is pretty good though. One down side to spicy garlic is that no one wants to come near me after I eat here, but it's worth it!   The shop is some what small (I find it interesting that other reviewers have said it's pretty large). It's a long shop, and has a bench table up front near the door. Then two areas of bar seatings. And then I think maybe two or three small tables in the back? (If that many). If you can visualize that, you can probably see that it's not particularly big...ANyway, the point of this is that depending on the time of the day (for example, lunch time), you might have to wait to get a seat, especially if you are with a group."}
{"text":"What can I say? Food is the same as every location. I am just glad that it is five minutes from my house and when my family has a ramen craving, we will be coming here. Very friendly staff, familiar faces. Large space."}
{"text":"I'd give this place a 3.5 stars if it were possible.   Kinton Ramen came recommended as the best ramen joint in town from a friend of a friend. I went in with great expectations, and that's probably why I came out a little disappointed (just a lil).   Aside from the customers, the place is pretty authentic Japanese. They got dem Japanese bowls and wooden spoons, and those tall tables and chairs. Pretty good stuff. The decor and staff were cool, although you could tell the staff were a little overworked.  The main reason I was a little disappointed was because the ramen weren't exactly stellar. Don't get me wrong, they were good, but just not the stellar I was expecting them to be.   I wouldn't mind visiting again, but there's usually a long line at the place and I'll probably end up eating somewhere else when I see the line."}
{"text":"As a regular to Kinton, I feel like I owe them a glowing review.   Food is always so fresh and delicious, coupled with fast and pleasant customer service. We've tried all the different kinds of Ramen on their menu, spicy garlic, original pork, Miso, cold soba, nothing ever disappoints!   My boyfriend is Japanese Canadian and we both believe this is hands down the best Ramen spot in Toronto. However, it would be nice to see a patio area in the summer!   If you are ever in the mood for a quick dinner with a few drinks and side dishes, this is the place to be."}
{"text":"My favourite ramen.. I've been to their 3 different locations and they are all good. Try the Chicken Karrage!!!"}
{"text":"Best ramen I've ever had. Highly recommend. My husband and I both loved our dishes. The pork belly ramen bowl was delicious. We had the pork dumplings for an appetizer and those were delicious as well. I don't usually like dumplings but these were amazing. Highly recommend trying this out."}
{"text":"This place is fresh, hot and decent. I am not a ramen connoisseur by any means (I prefer the stuff in the packages), but the soup was tasty, the noodles were not overdone and nicely chewy. The atmoshphere is busy, and you are seated very close to people you do not know (so not great for intimate meals). If I had one criticism, it would be that the soup was VERY SALTY. If other people wanted to come back, I would; but it's not top of my list."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch on a weekday because I was never able to get a table without waiting in line on week nights. I sat at the bar and was quickly given a menu. Wait time for order to arrive was about 10 minutes. They we're really busy.   I got the pork ramen and the good thing here is, you can died how strong of coup base you want. Eg mild, regular, or bold. You also pick noodle thickness, and whether you want pork shoulder or belly.  Overall it was delicious. I added corn for extra dollar and I got a mountain of it. Its great with the frothy pork soup base! They only gave two slices of pork which is below average. For $11, you'd expect a couple more... It was very good and tender though. Overall value, service, and taste, I give them 3.5*. Good overall."}
{"text":"Just love this place!!  The restaurant is on the small side and it's more of a quick bite to eat as opposed to a long, sit down- regardless, amazing!   My go-to combo is the chicken ramen w/ shoyu + thin noodles + seasoned egg + sweet corn + garlic.   Also tried the Hot Karaage and the Tofu Furai- both SO good!"}
{"text":"Was a long time regular. Today I went with a friend and they treated us like garbage. The food came 35 minutes late upon moving us around 5 times. The server refused to give me a glass of water for some reason. We finally receive our food and it was missing the cheese. They gave us a plate of cheese on the side. When I asked for water they started yelling at me in their native tongue.   When the bill came it was $16/each for ramen with missing toppings. We complained and they gave us a coupon for 1 order of gyoza with the purchase of ramen, that expires in 7 days.   The server even told us to GTFO when I gave him a 0% tip."}
{"text":"The ramen is outstanding here! The broth has great flavor. My husband ordered the cold ramen, which we loved! The quail egg with the sauce was unreal. I got the spicy garlic which is always a favorite. We happened to have found this place by accident last year when we were visiting but SO glad we did and went back this visit as well.   Space is a little cramped but totally worth it!"}
{"text":"I don't know if it's just b/c I should order the heavy broth (I'm always way too freaked out to do that) or if my taste buds are dead every time I go but the broth lacks a lot of flavour.  I just don't get that \"umami\" when I'm tasting that ramen and broth...it's quite sad.    I've gone a couple times now and each time, it's been a different experience - some better than others.    Line-ups are okay - the turnover is quite quick as luckily, it doesn't take long to eat a bowl of ramen.  You have to pay to get tea...so if you want something hot to drink (for free, order water).  Their hot tapas - karaage is worth trying but the tofu nuggets, not so much - especially since I believe you have to pay extra in that combo.    Overall, an okay experience."}
{"text":"I came here with my father tonight and we had a BLAST. The staff were absolutely AWESOME! The place was busy and very loud but it had such a great atmosphere. The CHICKEN MISO ramen was exceptional but the SPICY KARAAGE (fried chicken) happened to be the most delish dish. The portions were huge and the price can not be beat! You have to try this place out!"}
{"text":"Originally written during my meal in January '17 and forgotten about until now:  I've been here twice now and both times it's been underwhelming (but mostly because I always think it's going to be amazing). The broth is lacking depth of flavour and somehow is both not salty enough and too salty at the same time, it's disconcerting. The noodles are therefore also kind of bland.    My first time at kinton I ordered the original while my dining partner had the chicken ramen. This time I ordered the spicy. I would have to say the spicy is the   better of the two. The topping portions sizes are light. Also the combination of toppings each option comes with isn't my favorite (but that's honestly just personal preference).    Staff is great and quick, really nice people.   The price itself ok, $12.99+tax without extra toppings. I keep tasting the noodles and the broth as I write this and it continues to taste sort of bland. Which I don't get because the broth is a nice creamy color which usually implies flavour..."}
{"text":"It pains me to update this review. I think they have changed management or employees recently and it has not been a good change. The last visit they brought my egg allergic kid a meal with an egg in it, which was quickly discovered and we thought a one-off slip. Tonight they brought her the wrong meal twice in a row! By the third meal they brought her, mine was barely warm. No Manager checking in either time.  We've gone from regulars to not returning. :(  ______________________  With Sansotei nearby locations closed on Mondays we decided to give Kinton a try. It was packed on a March Break Monday at noon.  Decor was cool from the waist up. Most of the seating was stools, sprinkled with a few metal booth seats placed at a 90 degree angle. Lots of communal tables for eight in the middle. Less comfortable seating will help turnover customers quickly I suppose. That said, don't expect your meal to come quickly like at a pho place. It will take about 30 minutes from the time you order until when it hits the table.  We ordered: Fresh lemonade, perfectly tart Ramune (taste like a melted blue freezie yum). Cute glass marble. Chicken Karaage ramen - Mondays only - spicy and comes with thick noodles. I had wanted original but was glad I didn't get the choice. Delicious. Chicken Shoyu with thin noodles and corn - for my kid with the egg allergy. She loved it. Pork original with thin noodles. The only bowl where all the noodles got eaten.  Service was helpful. Loud, joyful kitchen behind me. Non-stop EDM, which I normally enjoy, but their mix was monotonous.  A repeat for us overall."}
{"text":"My kid loves Kinton and was hanging for ramen so we wandered in today around 1230pm on a weekday. Walking inside it was hotter than outside. It felt like a wall of steam. She wanted ramen so I thought \"maybe it's not that hot\".  A couple of Shoyu chicken with corn and a side of Swiss cheese to share. Took about 20 minutes and arrived piping hot. By then I noticed at the table of 20something guys beside us that one guy's tshirt was soaked with sweat.  The food itself was standard Kinton and the restaurant is nicely decorated. We ate quickly and got out of there into the cooler air outside (it was a hot July day)."}
{"text":"Love the vibe of this quaint little establishment. If you can get to the bottom of the bowl, then you are awarded with a button as a rite of passage into the exclusive club of all bottom-of-bowl achievers as well as an optional post on instagram. Pretty cool. It's just that I'm not particularly down for dropping $15 for a bowl of ramen. Definitely eat here if you are though!!"}
{"text":"This is my go-to comfort food location after a crappy day.  Original pork thick noodles.  The gomae spinach.  The baked oyster.  The salmon tataki.  So yummy.  The only downside is that all of my favourite add-ons are only available during dinner time.  Some of the other locations don't even have these items as each location has a different selection.  Seats aren't too comfy but definitely a hot spot for a lot of people.  Food is great and consistant all the time. Ramen power!!!"}
{"text":"3.5/5, +.5 for service  First time I've been back here since last summer. Kinton, it's been too long, I've tried the other famous ramen restaurants, and quite frankly you're not worth 5 stars anymore.  I had the shoyu ramen with regular broth, while my dad had the cheese ramen with spicy broth. One thing I noticed was they've put a lot more garlic this time around than last time. They seem to have significantly cut down on MSG, because believe it or not by shoyu broth was practically tasteless. Outside from that, the pork belly, boiled egg, and portions remain excellent, and the ramen I still find underwhelming when compared to Sansotei, but still better than all the other restaurants.  My dad's cheese ramen also suffered similar results. In his case, the broth wasn't hot enough, however the waitress quickly realized something was wrong when there was no heat coming out of my dad's bowl and got some hot chicken stock on the side for my dad. Of course, it meant the spicy broth was completely diluted, but the cheese did manage to melt to my dad's satisfaction. He was particularly impressed with the garlic-y sensation, the ramen, the sweet corn, but opted to go for pork belly instead of pork shoulder next time.  Service, as I said, was excellent. Extra marks for the waitress who quickly realized my dad's bowl wasn't hot enough. However, my standard for ramen has now gone up after being suffered with the likes of non-authentic/Ajisen/Kenzo Ramen for so long, and five stars is too high of a rating for this place now IMO."}
{"text":"3.5/5  Oh Kinton, how I loved ye for introducing me to ramen that's not Ajisen or Kenzo. That was way back around 2 years ago when I visited the Kinton branch downtown. Now that Kinton is extremely well known, they've expanded beyond their Baldwin branch and have opened branches across downtown, as well was here in North York Centre!  I visited this Kinton branch this past Saturday, as my original dining place had a 2 hour wait. Yes, I went to Kinton because a place had a long wait, when usually it's the other way around! Either way this place was full seated for the most part, but I didn't have to wait as there was a table of 3 immediately available.  The menu has changed slightly since my last visit to Kinton. They've now incorporated more of a build-your-own-ramen style, choosing your broth, type of ramen, your meat, your toppings, and whether you want any extra snacks. For my visit, I ordered pork ramen with miso flavour, regular broth, thick noodle, pork belly, and a side of takoyaki for $1.   The takoyaki arrived first, and I must say for $1 extra it was definitely worth the order! They give you 4 pieces, and they do not skimp out on the octopus pieces inside, averaging 2 for each piece. The ramen came second, and after trying out so many ramen places I've lost my unreserved love for Kinton. While the ramen is not bad, I definitely prefer Sansotei's thick ramen now. Kinton still makes the best pork belly, although for this branch the pork belly is narrower than the original store. Finally, the broth, despite the fact it was regular, tasted more bland than usual. I probably should've gone rich, though last time I went rich it was too rich for me. Can't seem to win sadly.  Considering my past Kinton experiences, I have to say service here is quite subpar. Normally a server will come to take your order and give you the bill without asking, but I had to wave someone down for both cases here. Also, the restaurant was too hot even though I was sitting nowhere near the kitchen, plus the fact it was a mild night that night.  For the most part, I'm still good with Kinton and would take someone here for food if the time comes. However, with the ramen craze that's taken over the region in the past 2-3 years, I have no choice but to up my standards, and sadly Kinton is losing ground in my ramen places to frequently visit in the future."}
{"text":"Came here for post-exam grub with friends a few weeks ago, and I had to say that this was a really \"meh\" reward for a brutal semester. While I was excited by the cute little wooden stools and the neat interior design, my main priority was to eat a semester's worth of my feelings in ramen.  I ordered the pork miso ramen with thick noodles, and it was really salty and heavy... I'm not really sure what they put in it, but it felt like there was cream and flour in the ramen because of how dang heavy it was. In terms of flavours, I couldn't taste anything beyond SALT. I love Japanese food, so saltiness usually isn't an issue for me... but this was just not cutting it. Not only did I not achieve my end-of-semester dream of eating all of my feelings, but I also ended up with terrible intestinal cramps a few hours after eating here, so lord knows what they put in this stuff. Sad times."}
{"text":"My first time at this place and I fell in love with not only the atmosphere, but the food. The spicy garlic ramen was delicious, but beware...lots and lots of garlic. The hot karaage was also awesome. I recommend this place highly."}
{"text":"Had the shoyu ramen with rich broth and pork belly. The broth was a little too salty and lacked any kind of depth, perhaps I'll try regular next time. Noodles were al dente, and the soft boiled eggs were a little well done, pork belly was very tender however. Atmosphere very energetic with their cheerful staff and awesome playlist. 3.5/5"}
{"text":"The restaurant is very cute. Will never lack service because they have too many people working in that tiny place. So yea, it is a very small place! Only one large group can dine at a time. Other seats are bar style or tables for 2-3 max. Wouldn't recommend for larger groups. It's a eat quickly and get out type of place. Menu is fairly simple and small. They only service pork or chicken ramen with different soup bases, a couple of side dishes and tea.   Ordered:  Pork ramen with miso soup base: $10the ramen was pretty average. Soup base was a little too salty even though I understand that it's ramen... but still. And it only comes with 2 slice of meat. Takoyaki: The takoyaki was honestly better then the ramen. Surprisingly!   Would I come back just for the ramen? No really... but the place was definitely a good experience."}
{"text":"This was a really depressing experience, really. It all seemed so promising when we first entered- the buzzing atmosphere and friendly shouts of 'irrashaimase!'- but looks can be deceiving. Unfortunately.   I have never been to Kinton 1, but I sure hope their customer service is better. Everyone hates waiting, but how do you feel about waiting close to AN HOUR to get your food served? Our takoyaki arrived (un)fashionably late, and it seemed to have been left out in the cold for quite some time considering that it was lukewarm. One of the appetizers we ordered was apparently sold out- and it was 2:00 pm in the afternoon! The ramen took longer to make, leaving my friend and I to scrape the leftover mayonnaise from the takoyaki dish as food. We were desperate to eat something.   The ramen finally appeared, along with our hot karaage. Was it because I was close to passing out from starvation? The food was delicious. I had the original pork shoulder ramen and my friend had spicy-garlic pork belly ramen. The broth was reminiscent of my mother's world-famous pork feet soup. They had generous slices of pork and a soft-boiled egg. The spicy garlic ramen had quite the kick to it, making me reach for the water glass after the second sip. I love the hot karaage- it had a sweet spiciness to it that enveloped the succulent fried chicken.   I couldn't finish my ramen so I asked for a container to take it home with. Apparently it COSTS EXTRA? For a disposable bowl to-go? What? The food itself was pretty good, but definitely not worth waiting for an hour to eat. I'll eat my sodium-loaded ramen somewhere else, thank you very much."}
{"text":"Ramen was hot and tasted good. Pork was a bit chewy. Service was very good. Try the cheese cake too."}
{"text":"We went to this restaurant located at Davisville for half price ramen which was $6 per bowl. Even though there was no name banner on the door, you won't miss it because there were so many people lining up for this event. We waited for one and a half hours and finally got sitting in. I ordered the original pork ramen which included two pieces of fat pork, two pieces of lean meat, seaweed and an boiled egg. The noodle you can choose thick or thin. The soup was too salty for me so that I couldn't finish all because I kept drinking tea. The meat was too dry. For a ramen restaurant, I will give it an average grade.  I would not recommend people to eat there unless they have a super deal."}
{"text":"Not even a big fan of ramen but I've tried a few places around Toronto and this had ought to be my favourite. Would definitely come back here for the food, the wait and the tight seating is still worth it!"}
{"text":"Similar to all the other restaurants but with larger table area vs high top bar seats. Very loud clubbing music and food took awhile to come out. They just opened 2 days ago so I'm sure they're just getting used to the very busy dinner rush."}
{"text":"Went on a Friday night with two other friends for dinner. I've been to the Kinton downtown before, and was hoping that this location would have the same type of quality in experience. The wait was fairly reasonable for a new restaurant, it ranged between 20-30 mins.  The wait time for the food was average. I ordered a shoyu pork ramen, my other two friends ordered the original soup base ramen with pork, and the spicy broth with pork ramen. We also ordered a hot karage (spicy fried chicken). All three broths in general were very watered down. My shoyu tasted the best out of the three in terms of soup base. The original (which is ironic because it's the original) was the most watered down. It didn't even have much of a pork taste to it - very bland. The spicy soup base tasted like half water, half Sriracha. The sauce for the spicy fried chicken tasted like a mixture of tomato, lemon, and Sriracha. All in all, the food was less than decent.   Now, the service that my friends and I were receiving was beyond disrespectful. Not only did we have to ask more than once for a refill on water. My main concern is that we asked if we could split the bill right when we put in our orders to avoid complications later when we asked for the bill. Our original server told us it was no problem, and so we told her how to split it. Tell me why, the next server brought our bill unsplit, and then he gives us attitude for requesting to split our bill again.   I definitely expected more from a restaurant under the Kinton franchise. It's a real shame that the service from the Kinton that I've been to from Baldwin St. downtown couldn't be replicated at this location. Honestly, I understand the hype, but if you're trying to grab a quick ramen fix from Markham, there are other places that provide better quality both in service, and in food options."}
{"text":"Ramen was good. Service was not that good but whatever. I arrived there early than others and they didn't let me sit down for a bit when most tables are empty. They should at least put some chairs in the front  because they do not let people to sit down at the table while waiting for others. It's understandable because the place is usually packed. The quality was amazing but just too pricey. I go there once a while  but not all the time. If your paying for quality then the place is great. Overall it's a great place but I don't recommend eating there on regular basis."}
{"text":"The food quality here has gone down hill quite a lot. The highlight here for me were the fried chicken and the marinated egg, however they are not as good as before. The chicken I got was quite burnt and they tasted bitter, the colour was almost black, and it was really greasy. And the marinated egg was almost cooked all the way through, the yolk is almost completely set, and the flavour does not penetrate through the egg yolk."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try Ramen for a while but held off on it because I thought I would enjoy it more during the the cool weather. So I went here on a cold fall night hoping for some ramen to warm me up :). I ordered chicken breast, light broth, miso base with jalepeno paste and a seasoned egg accompanied with thick noodles. The ramen was prepared well but it was still a bit bland for my palette. I am not sure if I would consider myself a ramen fan. However the tako wasabi (octopus wasabi), octopus balls, and the fried chicken we ordered for appetizers were simply yummy! I really liked the ambiance as well, which makes it for a great place to catch up with a friend over some $3 beer on a weeknight. I would recommend this place for people who want to try ramen. Be the judge for your self!   Cool fact: If you finish your bowl they take a picture of you for their instagram account and present you with a button and a card where you collect stamps every time you finish a bowl eventually receiving a free bowl!"}
{"text":"This place is really cool - nice open bar area so Yu can see the Japanese guys make their ramen. and they yell random stuff loudly, which is awesome. The decor is nice (the wall is this coop square wood pattern that I couldn't help but touch). Staff is really friendly - they insisted on taking a photo with us and posting it on the kintonbowler instragram. Very fun.  I ordered the pork miso ramen (thick noodles, heavy taste) with pork shoulder. For some reason the broth didn't really... have any flavour. It was rich but flsvourless, which is almost a marvel itself. I was really disappointed because it looked great. Maybe they forgot to put salt in this batch or something, I dunno. Anyway, I didn't end up finishing my bowl, although that may partly because of me recovering from NYE drinking.  I was going to give this place a two but I really enjoyed the atmosphere here, and Ill give the place the benefit of the doubt and assume they were just off their miso game that day. Hope the rest of 2015 is better."}
{"text":"Don't you remember when Kinton was still a novelty and everyone came here to finish a bowl to have their pictures put up on the site. ...well, now there are 4 of them.  Really thought Yelp trolled me with the #'s after the name, I think it would've stayed a novelty for longer not as a chain store but rather sitting by itself on Baldwin.    Tbh, the dish I had was probably 4-star worthy.  I had their summer special, the chilled ramen with pork and quail egg.  Presentation was super neat, little quail egg, soy sauce, green onions etc in a separate bowl to mix and then to pour onto the ramen.  I loved it, it was very flavourful. Just as flavourful as the Kinton Ball we had ... when you're done laughing at the name you should give this crispy mayo-encrusted egg a try.  It's just.. good.  With that said, Kinton's main selection of hot ramens lack flavour.  They taste like garlic, all of the hot ramen that I've ever tried.  Yes, it's filling.. but you can get better ramen at Santouka or Sansoeti without a doubt if you're not looking for chilled ramen.  I think the days of Kinton are over and a 5 should not pop up any time soon, if ever"}
{"text":"Service here is so shit it's ridiculous, they took our order and after waiting 40 minutes they told us they lost our order and we had to wait another 20 for our food to come.. don't eat here unless you feel like waiting an hour for a mediocre bowl of ramen"}
{"text":"This is going to be bias as I've have been going to Kinton Ramen for the last year or so for my ramen fix. I first came across their Yonge and Finch location and was overjoyed when the Markham branch opened. Tonight, I tried out the Markham branch special menu item, Hiyashi Markham and I am happy to report that I loved it. It was a perfect dish for the summer. Chilled noodles in a cold ginger broth with a small mountain of toppings, along with a dash of horseradish on the side for an extra kick. Overall a good night."}
{"text":"The restaurant is a bit small and crowded, but we got seated real quick. First off, the ramen was delicious!!!! My table of three all ordered the Original Extra Pork thick ramen combo with a few extra toppings (corn for my sister and I, corn and butter for the bf). WARNING!!! Beware for the epic portions for the Extra option. Besides the belt busting sizes, the ramen was perfect al dente (pardon the Italian), the broth was clear, rich, deep, and flavourful.  The combo came with a side dish of Ton Ton Don, Chiki Chiki Don (which they were sold out of), or Age Gyoza. The Ton Ton Don was moist and seasoned just the right amount. The Age Gyoza, was fried just right and had the most delightful sweet and tangy sauce drizzled over it. Overall, the meal was satisfying and filling. Also it measured up to my bf's high standards for ramen, and in my books, it's the best I've had so far!"}
{"text":"I was excited to eat at this place because I always see a line up outside the door and heard great things. I will be honest and say that the ramen was okay. I got the spicy garlic broth and pork belly. I appreciated that you can really customize your ramen, the egg is delicious. But between my ramen, my partners ramen, and the appys the food was nothing special. The broth was bland. Our server however was great! This place is still better than a lot of other ramen joints, just not worth the line ups. PS. noticed they had a sign by the door that listed all thier rules... \"No standing by the door to wait\" (they expect you to wait outside in the cold) \"Only the ppl present for a reservation will be seated.\" Etc. The list is quite long, kind of funny, but mostly unwelcoming!"}
{"text":"Ordered the tofu nuggets as a starter and the vegetarian ramen with thick noodles and bean sprouts added. Food was really good. Really likes the sauce on the nuggets. Staff were very friendly and helpful in terms of making suggestions."}
{"text":"Fantastic ramen. The best in Mtl in my opinion. The spicy karaage chicken is also a must. Good service, very tasty food, excellent price. 5 stars."}
{"text":"I was never a fan of kinton ramen but I decided to give this place a try as they opened up near me.  At least they got the consistency part right as they did taste same as any other location which also meant that they also had the old porky smell. The noodle is just a regular factory made egg noodle though it did have rather strong smell of egg than normal.  For their tapas their karaage tastes very dry and overcooked and gyoza is deep fried which is my least favourite way of cooking dumplings (probably deep fries them as it is the easiest way to cook it). In appetizer aspect they were a little below average.  All in all I would say ramen here is just average so if you had craving you can go, but I wouldn't go out of my way to visit them. As for their tapas I wouldn't be surprised if most of them are pre-made and delivered from factory as they all tasted below average."}
{"text":"You're Short on time to eat? Don't eat here. The wait time to receive a bowl of noodles is atrocious.   They would normally hold a 3 stars for me because KINTON is the baseline of what acceptable ramen would be in Toronto. They lose a star for their snail paced service. Be ready to wait 20 mins for a bowl during non-rush hour time"}
{"text":"Over-rated ramen just because you see a big ass line up outside of this tiny place....I heard about the rav on this place so I decided to check it out on a saturday night and dang, i waited 2 hours for literally a bowl of ramen with screaming chefs infront of me....Not saying that the ramen is terrible but there is nothing special about it thats worth the wait or the distance to get here....restrooms were neat btw"}
{"text":"At least, it's the closest ramen to UofT. Perfect choice for lunch to the students of UofT especially the engineering student"}
{"text":"Preface: I was very hungover and needed a big bowl of soup. I got the spicy garlic ramen with extra noodles and extra pork shoulder. Definitely a solid bowl. Not a fan of the shoulder, though. Too chewy. Next time I'll probably go for a more simple broth. This was REALLY garlicky  What killed me, though, was the music. They were playing dancehall remixes of god-awful disco/bar-mitzvah songs and it was SO LOUD.   When push comes to shove, there is better ramen in the city. Hell, between Ajisen and Kenzo, there is better ramen on the block!"}
{"text":"J'ai lu la pluspart des reviews (après m'être forgé ma propre opinion) et je vais y aller dans le même sens que tout le monde: ça ne goûte pas assez!! C'est plus dispendieux que bien d'autres places (bien des ingrédients normalement \"de base\" sont en options), la qualité est ok mais les saveurs ne sont pas à la hauteur du prix... Gyoza sont frits et sont l'équivalent d'un eggroll? Le karaage est gluant au lieu de croustillant? Le bouillon est fade? Dommage car le staff est gentil (anglophone mais essaie quand même de discuter en français, apprécié) et l'endroit est quand même mignon. Pas de wifi.

{"text":"Headed here on a Thursday and this place was crooooooooowded. There was already a small mob waiting outside as well, and it was only 5pm. We were only a party of 2, though, so we got seated pretty quickly at the bar. They sell pretty large steins of beer at moderate prices. Nothing to rave about, but nothing to cry about either. Their waitstaff, at least when I went, was comprised solely of jort-claid, moustachioed hipsters. Not sure how that happened but it was a funny thing to note.   Ordered the Miso ramen, and was a little irked that I had to pay extra for an egg - to me, egg is an integral part of ramen, and paying extra for it is a little absurd. The soup was pleasantly salty and flavourful, and the noodles walked the line well between soggy and crispy very well.   Delicious ramen. Not sure if it lives up to the hype. Some people had to wait up to 30 minutes to get into the restaurant - not sure if it would have been worth it for me."}
{"text":"Kinton is just one of those places you crave for, that make me drive all the way from Markham ... just for a bowl of soup noodles? Oh but it's so much more! In my opinion Kinton has the BEST ramen in the city. It may be busy, it may be loud, you may have to line up for an hour at 10pm ... but it's all worth it. You're greeted cheerfully, and served promptly. The portions are delicious and large, and out of the two times I have been here I have not been able to finish my bowl (as good as it was). A must try! (5-stars for it's class)"}
{"text":"Kinton Ramen is good, but definitely not worth the wait.  Cute homey restaurant..I love the environment.  Service is prompt and friendly.  I love the bar seating and the fact that stools at the bar have little shelves for you to store your purse. :)  We ordered: - Gyoza: soooooo good..only comes with 4 gyozas though. - Shio ramen: regular w/pork shoulder...maybe a 3.5 star dish.  I wouldn't order again. - Shoyu order: regular w/pork shoulder.  It was delicious!!  The noodles were good, broth had these little droplets of fat in them (read the menu - it's something about collagen)  The ramen came with 2 large slices of pork, a whole egg (the yolk was still kind of runny, so open it right away if you want your yolk to cook, like I do), and seaweed.  YUM!!  I'd come back but only if I didn't have to wait.  Just a tip: come right at opening.  We arrived at 11:30am on a Saturday, and the place was full by 11:40."}
{"text":"The noodles were a little over cooked but the karaage was so good! Service was decent and has a nice atmosphere. We sat at the bar"}
{"text":"Love that you can personalize your ramen bowl just like in most traditional japanese ramen restaurants. Love the vibe, nice for group of friend who just want to enjoy a hot and flavorful bowl of ramen in the warm (not so say freezing) weather :)"}
{"text":"Have heard many great things about Kinton Ramen, so I decided to try it.   I have to say, I'm kinda disappointed. I got the Kyonosuke's Tsukemen and it.... Was actually kinda disgusting. The fish & pork based dipping broth was super oily and had a terrible aftertaste. Without a broth (or in this case, a dipping broth), the noodles were super dry and stuck together a bit too much. After a few bites, the whole dish just felt very heavy.... Too much oil and too much noodle.   Maybe it was just what I ordered. Hopefully, if I even choose to visit again, the other dishes aren't like this...."}
{"text":"We came after hearing great reviews since this is much loved in Toronto Ontario. We ordered both pork soup base, one original and one spicy, both with extra corn. We came at lunch so we got their lunch combo which was worth it for the price of their original menu. The lunch combo just came with an extra small side (either pork or chicken with mayo on rice, literally like a small Bowl). We got both with thick noodles because the waiter recommended it, and we also both got extra noodles. We also ordered takoyaki.  The noodles were hard, not sure if supposed to be like this or if it was under cooked. But it was not good. The original soup base had more flavour than the spicy one but definitely not enough. The spicy one just tasted off and bad, do not get it. Use the spicy salt that's given on table instead to make spicy. I basically almost used half the shaker to give my original a bit more taste. The chicken was good, soft, lots of flavour. They give lots of corn.   I have had better ramen before, and won't be returning to this place unfortunately. I expected a lot more in taste. Left pretty unsatisfied both my boyfriend and I.   If you do go, the takoyaki is probably the best I've ever had, which is why this review gets 2 stars instead of one. But it's a ramen shop and not a takoyaki shop so they should be perfecting their ramen instead of sushi.   Our waiter was extremely nice and talkative which made the experience a bit better but I originally came for the ramen, not the waiter or the takoyaki.   Also they need to turn up the ac because it's hot and ramen is hot so it was really uncomfortable considering its July in Montreal."}
{"text":"Good ramen!  Took the chicken shoyu and it was delicious! The broth was rich...almost creamy. Nice flavour that goes well with the thin noodles.  Also tried the pork spicy ramen with a side of nori. Soup was very flavourful although I did prefer the shoyu version.  Staff was also nice. The place is pretty big so you don't risk not getting a seat if you don't come on busy nights."}
{"text":"Best ramen place. Spicy garlic pork ramen with soft boiled egg every time. When I am really hungry I ll order that combo with chiki chiki don and ramen."}
{"text":"Ok! So first off, noodle soup and blistering weather is not a good combination but after hearing so many people talk about this place, I just had to try it. After all, this was put out by the same people that brought Guu to Toronto. After walking in from the smoldering outdoors, I didn't think I could get any hotter but alas, it could. Inside was like a sauna! It actually felt cooler to be under direct sunlight than in that soup bath! But aside from the internal temp, the food was mediocre at best.   We ordered the Spicy Fried Chicken and Deep Fried Tofu to start. The chicken was crispy and tender but there was not enough sauce so it made the chicken hard to go down. The tofu on the other hand was the saving grace of the meal. It was, by far, hands down, THE dish to order. It was nice and crispy and packed with lots of flavour from the mayo based sauce that was drizzled on top.   And now to the main feature, the ramen. We opted for a bowl each of the Spicy Garlic and the Cheese Ramen. The portion sizes are quite hearty but most of it was quite lack luster. The noodles were chewy and cooked just right but the soup base was alright and didn't tingle any of my foodie senses. The only flavourful part of the dishes was the pork belly (definitely go with the pork belly vs. the pork shoulder). Although you get an extra slice of pork when you order the shoulder, it was lacking in tenderness and flavour that the fat of the belly gives you. The pork belly was amazingly juicy and seasoned well but that small chunk did not make up for the disappointment of the ramen bowl.   So all in all, I'd definitely order the deep fried tofu for take out (if they offer it) but would not be going back again for the ramen."}
{"text":"I used Ritual for my first and only order so far from this location.  I'm glad they've got a vegetarian option, but I wish there were more than one.  It's not bad as long as you get to the fried tofu relatively quickly after adding the broth.  Service was fast and friendly, and I'd probably go here again.  The ramen itself is pretty basic, but inoffensive."}
{"text":"Best Kinton location. Fast, friendly service. Ramen is always great & I've never left disappointed. It can get busy most evenings & weekends. Even if it does, the line up moves fairly quickly."}
{"text":"I heard Toronto had some killer ramen so I had to give it a try. The staff great you and say goodbye in a really fun way - makes for a great atmosphere.   There were a lot of options but the menu was easy to follow. I ended up going with the monthly special - a fish brother with pork belly, onion, scallions, and a seasoned egg. I added fresh shaved garlic and seaweed which was recommended on the menu.   Great service and great food.   Sit at the bar if you want to watch the masters work!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Wish I ordered extra noodle from the beginning because it's not enough for me."}
{"text":"Food is ok but not great! But service is horrible. Ordered shoyu tonkatsu black. Not only we have to wait almost 20 minutes to get our orders (is this really a ramen place? ) it came out wrong. I tried to get the attention of the waitress who make herself look busy as she would walk past us several times even though we already had her attention. We asked her if we got our order right since it doesn't have any black garlic oil in it and without even bother looking she answered yes. I had a feeling she just brush us off without understanding what we are asking. I later asked another waiter's help which he kindly said it was missed and provide the black garlic oil to be added. Turned out, the ramen tasted very salty.  We will never visit this place again!"}
{"text":"We stopped by here for dinner at 10:00 on a Saturday and were told the wait would be about 30 minutes. Everyone was waiting politely on or around the bench, but we decided to take a walk. We definitely came back within 30 minutes and they had already passed us on the list, though the wait was only a couple more minutes when we got back. At 10:30 the wait to get seated was gone and the people who came in at that time also had to wait far less time to get their food.  As for the food, it was interesting but not great. I got the Shio ramen, and made the mistake of getting it extra rich. The broth was actually pretty nice, though it was way too fatty for me by the end. I think next time I would get it thin instead.   My partner ordered the garlic ramen which was a little hot but a lot of garlic. I love garlic but this was so much that it really killed any subtlety in the soup. I would definitely not get this one again.  The noodles were a good bit firmer than I am used to. They were not bad, but clearly out of a package instead of fresh.   The atmosphere was kind of pleasant. Service was quick, though it took a bit to get our food to us, and in fact I actually felt a bit rushed and like I didn't get to study the menu as much as I would like. We sat close to the kitchen and got to watch them making the ramen as we waited, which was definitely impressive. The shtick around yelling everytime a party came in and out got old pretty fast, however, and created a noiseness that was a bit unpleasant. Overall it was a solid and cheap meal, but not ramen that I crave like I do from the best places."}
{"text":"Visited fairly early for lunch and had the spicy garlic ramen with pork belly. Seems like a nice place if you are alone given they had a lot of bar/railroad-style seating. My friends endorsed Kinton for ramen in Toronto, but I generally found the order to be very much average on all counts, and nothing really stood out at all.  Also fairly put off by how adamantly the waitress insisted I should have it regular instead of rich, even after mentioning that my friend recommended I order that way."}
{"text":"Came here on the grand opening day at about 2PM in anticipation of the crowd from the free bowls of ramen; surprisingly only had to wait about 10 minutes for a table.  Upon entering, there is a coat rack to hang your coat as tables are very small and stools are backless with nowhere to store handbags or coats... don't really know if I like this concept as many of us have expensive winter coats that are extremely popular...subject to theft and mixup. That being said, it appears the amount of seating is maximized while still have enough space for staff to get around without stepping over customers.  As it is grand opening, it did take a long time for us to have our orders taken, get our water and to receive our food, hopefully this will improve. I ordered the spicy pork ramen ($11.99) and chicken karage (~$8). The ramen, unlike the other locations I have been to, no longer provides choice of belly or shoulder; it comes with one of each (haven't been to other locations in a while..this may be the same across the board!).  The menu offers a lot of side dishes, most which are dinner-only.. so I may have to come back and try them!"}
{"text":"Beat the dinner rush as we arrived just before 6PM. We ordered the cold noodles and the spicy ramen with pork belly, delicious!  The cold noodles were very good, it came as a generous portionof noodles, 2 pieces of pork shoulder, a bowl of soy sauce with mixins of raddish, green onions, wasabi and a raw egg ($12).  The spicy ramen with pork belly was also delicious, but it did not have very much noodles...there was equal parts noodles to bean sprouts ($11).  Overall, great experience as the restaurant is very lively (lots of chanting from the staff) and good service. Would not recommend for larger parties as they only have one large table, the rest are bar seating and tables of 3."}
{"text":"Came here for a late Saturday dinner  It's a smallish place and was pretty busy  We started with the gyoza, which were tasty  Then we ordered 2 Ramen -  1 extra pork, mix of pork belly &  shoulder, original style with jalapeño paste on the side 1 chicken Ramen, spicy with chicken breast Both with thick noodles and extra noodles  The Ramen was sort of tasty but had a little fake taste to it (sort of like they use power or buillion to add flavour)  The pork was tastier than the chicken and the pork shoulder was the tastiest but it was very salty  Prices were also quite high considering portion size and what you're getting (these 3 things cost about $50 with tax and tip)  We both had some leftover and they told us there is a charge for a take out container (it's only 50 cents but I still can't believe we were charged for a take out container, especially when the prices are already high for what you are getting)  It's OK but really nothing special and I'm sure you can find cheaper, tastier Ramen in the city (plus a place that probably won't charge you for a takeout container)"}
{"text":"I love ramen and have been to kinton a couple of times downtown, so I was looking forward to trying the location on highway 7. I ordered the chicken spicy jalapeño ramen and side gyoza. The broth was quite salty and it wasn't very spicy, very mild if anything. The noodles were quite delicious and had a good bite, but I found the broth to be way too overpowering. I tried my friends ramen and theirs were quite salty as well. I think when we came in they just cleaned the tables so it kind of smelt odd when we arrived and were dining in. If I were craving ramen the kinton on Hwy 7 might not be my first choice. The gyoza was quite delicious though!"}
{"text":"4 * food, 3 * ambiance and 2 * prices make this not your first choice to get Ramen. But if you're in a bind for time and need a place to go this is as good as any"}
{"text":"This is the best ramen place I've ever been to. The employees were very kind and provided amazing service. It was very trendy and modern which is something you don't find in many ramen places. It has a very lively atmosphere, all of the workers say goodbye and thank you to you when you leave the restaurant. It is also in a great location, right in downtown Montreal, leaving lots to do after you finish eating. The ramen was amazing I got the spicy chicken ramen and my fiancé got the original. They both tasted great and we will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"The thing I love most about this establishment is the consistency in their dishes. I can always stop by on a Friday afternoon and get my favourite Ramen (miso) just the way I like it!"}
{"text":"Came here on a rainy Tuesday and I don't know if it's the rain that set the mood or the chefs were having a good day but the ramen that day was A1. I've read a lot of mixed reviews about this specific location but I definitely enjoyed my experience there. Firstly, the service was phenomenal... they greet you upon arrival and when you leave AND they check up on you to make sure everything is good. I ordered the pork miso ($12.99) with thin noodles and I loved it... the portion of noodles was more than I could even finish. The broth was not as garlic-y as I had anticipated but it was still muy delicioso. I had also ordered the original karaage ($6.90) which I found a little more on the pricier side for like 5 pieces BUT the pieces were quite large and this was probably my favourite dish because the chicken was extra juicy and crispy. My sister got the pork shoyu ($12.99) and she's OBSESSED. The only complaint I have so far is that their pop is non-refillable (I honestly think it should be).  Other than that, it's a good spot, it's clean and spacious, the food is good and the servers are attentive."}
{"text":"This is a typical ramen bar that is narrow on the space but big on the flavour.  I've never know a ramen place to ever have a large space.  We waited for 20 minutes on a Wednesday evening (tonight) and that wasn't too bad as it was warm outside.  And this was for 4 people.  Oh and they ran out of ramen for the night but had a thinner noodle and offered us 10% off for that.  I got the homemade lemonade which was a bit more sour and used a different sugar (maybe rock sugar?).  I diluted it with some water as I found it a bit too sour, but it's an acquired taste I think.  Do give it a try.  I ordered the vegetable ramen, and it was quite tasty.  I really enjoyed the broth and the noodles but ultimately I couldn't finish my ramen :(  My friends had the spicy garlic ramen (very spicy!), the cheese ramen (which my friend liked and something I'd try next time), and the shoyu ramen (also quite pleasant).  I have heard that the shio ramen is quite salty and should be avoided.  Yes, I would come back again, especially since I'm very curious about the cheese ramen.  I found it to be slightly better than Kenzo."}
{"text":"Good ramen for a reasonable price. Friendly staff.  Finish your bowl completely and get a picture taken!"}
{"text":"At first I was quite excited to hear Kinton ramen was opening in  Montreal. I came here a few weeks ago for a snack. Unfortunately, it's not as amazing as the original Kinton ramen that I have tried in Toronto. It could be due to the fact that their menu is still being revised.    Overall, they are a descent ramen restaurant. If you are craving a bowl of ramen I would recommend you to go because the location is very convenient. Staff members were kind and friendly as well."}
{"text":"After starving myself on a cold winter night in Toronto, I decided to treat myself to a nice bowl of ramen. I looked around for options and Kinton stood up because of the Spicy Garlic Pork Belly noodles they offer.  This is an epic bowl of ramen, choose thick noodles and regular broth. Also, add sweet corn. You won't regret it. The taste is amazing and they do a great job of the Pork Belly. It's not too fatty, as they are flamed individually. It's also a large piece compared to other ramen spots I've tried across Canada. The spice could of been more. The garlic taste was particularly strong but if you love garlic it's perfect! Make sure you mix it well with your soup to get the full flavour.  As seen above, I got the combo that came with Japanese Oyomaki Octopus Balls which was truly tastey.  The head chef YUSHIN is a young ramen master, and he made my day recently at Kinton Ramen at North York. We spoke about Japan and his work ethic was quite intense. He would be bowling noodles, flaming pork belly, and putting dishes to wash all at the same time!  As seen below at the photos, he enjoys his job greatly and loves making ramen! Do you like ramen? What are you waiting for! Check out Kinton Ramen."}
{"text":"Two words: Loud and Underwhelming.  After driving by a few times, I decided to finally try out the newly opened Kinton, and see how it compares to the oh so perfect Sansotei and Santouka. We were seated right away, but it took them nearly 30 long minutes to bring out our order.  Shio with Pork Shoulder $9.8 (came with seasoned egg) Miso with Pork Belly $9.8 Extra Noodles $2 Seasoned Egg $1  It wasn't Ajisen bad, but for me, it was just a tad better than Kenzo.The broth wasn't rich or flavourful enough for me. I also found it oily. I didn't eat any of the pork, but my partner said it wasn't as tender and flavourful as Sansotei's. He did finish and drank his bowl of ramen, but not because he enjoyed it, we just wanted to have his picture taken and posted on their Facebook and Instagram page for kicks.   I know it's a delicious bowl of ramen when I am left feeling sad as I am slurping the last few strands of noodles and spooning the last few drops of broth. Kinton didn't deliver this. Perhaps, I am spoiled by Sansotei. I appreciated the fact that we didn't have to wait in line out in the cold, but I don't think I'll come back here anytime soon.   Parking - Street Parking Meat Options - You can add chicken breast for an extra $1.00 Ambiance - Like Guu, it is loud but very modern."}
{"text":"It is my favorite place to get Ramen, clean, friendly and welcoming staff. Very short and professional menu, with very good ingredients and exploration of flavors. I tried original and hot pork ramen, and very satisfied with the taste. Already recommended it to many friends in Toronto and Montreal. I have tried the fried chicken, it was just under cooked, but with amazing flavor. I recommend you to try it here"}
{"text":"EDIT: My SO got really sick after eating here opening day, so the original three-star review has been changed. Original post below.   I came here for lunch the day of their grand opening, which offered 50% off noodle bowls with the option of additional toppings at regular price. Seats are designed with a small space directly underneath to hold personal items, which is cool. The pork miso ramen ($13 reg. price) was a bit disappointing, with the pork and soup under seasoned and their noodles undercooked. Garlic oil of the ramen was also underwhelming, leaving the soup bland. Their original house ramen ($13 reg. price) also lacked, with little pork flavour in the broth and their soft-boiled egg with raw egg whites instead of solid whites and a runny yolk. The broth of the dish, which my SO ordered, tasted off, with a fishy aftertaste.   In general, the details of ramen really make or break a dish, and this place didn't really do it for me. With other places in the GTA charging less for better ramen, I don't think I'd pay $13 for a normal item, or more for something off their customizable menu, though this place would be good if you're looking to eat nearby and leave quickly.   Hopefully these inconsistencies are just because of the busyness of the day, but it pales in comparison to the detailed standard of most ramen places even during busy service. I'd recommend waiting until they get into their rhythm before visiting."}
{"text":"I have to give Kinton four stars since the ramen is always delicious (as is the gyoza), but I have to say that the service today was definitely not the best - although, it was the grand opening, so I'll cut them some slack due to how incredibly busy it was. My friend had specified that she didn't want bean sprouts several times and still ended up with them in her soup. I had already finished my bowl of ramen before she finally got hers sans bean sprouts.   The ramen was free since we were part of the first 88 customers to arrive, so I definitely can't say that I'm too upset about anything. :)"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch, and enjoyed it. It was a roomy restaurant with a clean restroom. We ordered the Pork Original and the Pork Shoyu - both were very good. I've been to many ramen places where I end up finding the broth too salty, but both of these were fine. We got the special which included side dishes of Tonton Don (pork was shredded pretty thinly- I thought it was just okay) and Chikichiki Don (a mayo-based sauce - this was enjoyed at our table). These side dishes were a bit smaller than I expected, but fine for am accompanying small child if you have one in tow. The takoyaki (fried octopus balls) I felt were just so-so, I would skip next time. For dessert, I had to try black sesame pudding, which was excellent!!! One compliment I have is for the attentiveness of the waitstaff and their care in addressing my allergy concerns. One of the young waiters took it very seriously and brought back to us the allergen sheet they had to my table to double-check everything with me. i was impressed with this nice service. The black sesame pudding is made of soymilk, so that dessert is dairy free if you also forgo the cream on top)."}
{"text":"It's solid no frills ramen . . .not a lot of nuance . . .super busy at lunch and seemed not very efficient in the service. The couple next to me were waiting a looong time for their food and I ordered pork and they gave me chicken and the guy on my other side was also waiting kind of a long time. . . . And kinda pricey for no frills ramen.  Meh."}
{"text":"I love ramen i could probably eat it everyday. Kinton is one of the better known Ramen places in Toronto. It's a little hard to find but once you eventually find it the resturant is really  tight and the communal tables are super close together.  I came her about 3:00Pm on the day the subways were  out of service to kill some time as I wanted to try Kinton since my dad raves about it. I ordered the spicy garlic ramen with chicken.  While waiting for my ramen I went to the bathroom now the bathrooms are nice! I could write an entire review based on the bathroom, theyre huge personal bathrooms with all the amenities of your bathroom at home. the music in the bathrooms was even different from the music in the general restaurant it was more soothing and relaxing. ok enough on the bathrooms.  The ramen it self was good? Im only giving it 3 stars because the spicy garlic ramen was not spicy at all and the chicken was flavourless. the ramen was super garlicy which i liked but i wished the chicken was grilled or flavoured in some way. so all in all I would give it 3.5 stars but I'm going to go with 3 stars for now and hopefully they change how they serve the chicken."}
{"text":"Very good Ramen restaurant. The prices are a little high for the portion with very small portions of meat. However the soup and noodles are very good, I do not recommend the chicken as it is very bland and would recommend the cha siu. Service is very good but the tables are authentically small, just like in Japan!"}
{"text":"Good, very rich and filling broth, well cooked meat, good ramen. Will come again. The music choice is eclectic (a mix of Japanese and English stuff - some game music or OST thrown in?) and the music is too loud."}
{"text":"Probably my favourite Ramen shop in Toronto (Baldwin Location), and now they are in Mississauga with a MUCH easier to get to location....AND they are still as good as ever. I love Kinton, and you should too!"}
{"text":"New favorite Ramen shop. I felt like I visited Japan today. The decor is like a Japanese Ramen Shop, and it's run entirely by Japanese. Not only do you get to choose the type of broth and type of meat, but you can choose the strength of the broth as well; mild, regular, or rich. FULL of flavor the broth was, but what stood out to me was the taste of the meat, absolutely perfect. Generally at Ramen Shops in Toronto, the broth is the main focus and the meat is only based on its quality...not how well it's prepared. At Kinton they prepare it brilliantly.."}
{"text":"The Kinton on Baldwin is my favorite Ramen in Toronto. The same can't be said for this place. We went to the Mega Ramen challenge and our waiter who didn't speak english couldn't answer ANY of our questions and it took almost 45 minutes for my friend to finally order ramen WITHOUT the green onion garnish on top.  Now I'm all up for failing challenges, but this $30 challenge is unbeatable. If you are going to multiply the meat by 4, and everything else by 3....how can you not multiply the broth and flavor?? This was the most unsatisfying tasteless ramen ever. It was like eating 8 pounds of noodles soaked in nothing but oil. And the temperature was scorching even after an hour and half of sitting there. But people are supposed to finish this hot slop in 15 minutes? Nah..."}
{"text":"THIS PLACE IS MY FAVORITE RESTAURANT IN ALL OF TORONTO. The waiters are friendly, and the ramen is delicious. I like how packed it is inside, and how loud the waiters are when cooking the noodles. I would actually encourage them to yell even louder, because it gets me all fired up when i'm slurping. I enjoy this restaurant at its busiest hours, where there is a lot of hustle and bustle, and a lot of crammed seating. WHY?! Cause i'm feeding off that contagious energy, and it's making my noodles taste a whole lot better eh! If i see someone within my vicinity enjoying their noodles a helluva lot, i feel almost inclined to enjoy the food even more. Maybe that's why i like this place so much. I DUNNO, but there's definitely a secondary reason besides the food tasting good and i'm pretty sure this is it.   Anyways, i always get the rich broth and pork belly, obviously cause its the fattiest option. Tastes great. And being a Kinton Bowler rules cause i get my picture taken!"}
{"text":"***Based on 50% Off Grand Opening Promo/Service***  Watch out KENZO, you have got some competition!  However, your competition gotz no free parking, so you may still win battle of the ramen places in 'ssauga.  I'll admit that I'm not much of a ramen person because I find the trend a bit overhyped.  And up 'til today, KENZO was the only place for it and I'm not gonna wait in line for $$$ noodles.  Also, the broth is usually loaded in sodium, so I've eaten it maybe a handful of times.  Anyway, Kinton opened up on the ground floor of the PSV building.  There is NO free, immediate parking.  So you can either pay for parking on Burnhamthorpe/Confederation OR take your chances to park underground in a neighbouring condo.    Parking Sitch:  The condos on Brickstone Mews does have Commercial/Visitors parking, but shh...you did not hear that from me!  You can also try free street parking on Webb, directly south of the now-empty M-City lot.  Service:  I was very impressed by the efficient and friendly service here on Grand Opening Day!  We came at an off-time, so there wasn't much of a line.  A worker came around and took people's order while they stood near the front of the line.  A menu is posted outside.  Once you're seated your food arrives ~15mins.  There are plenty of workers circulating with water, asking you how your food is, if you need anything, etc.  It was well-staffed!    Atmosphere:  Less than 20-tables of either 2-4-6 + seating at the bar.   Those crate stools are uncomfortable.  20' ceilings makes it seem roomier than it is.  They also shout at you as you enter/leave/take a pic for Instagram.  So it's an Izakaya-type atmosphere.  Do not expect candlelit date night dinner here.  It's fairly loud!  Food:  I ordered the Original Chicken and it was good, homey broth wasn't too salty.  It was nice and tasted like an Asian creamy chicken noodle soup.  Could've used more veg, but it was fine for the promo price of $6.50.  Would I pay the regular $12.99, maybe 1-2/year, but not more than that!  If you want a lighter option, you can split the bowl with someone.  A bowl is more than sufficient for an adult though!  Thin noodles - same as Wonton noodles Thick noodles - same as Instant/spaghetti to give you an idea  Chicken Karage was nice, meat was juicy, and not drenched in oil.  It had a nice crunch to it!  No LLBO yet.  I believe they're in the process as there is beer on their menu."}
{"text":"I'll wait before giving extra stars because I have eaten here only once. But wow. How do these places get their broths so creamy, rich, and flavourful? This is a cute little place, with happy staff. I had chicken ramen and was almost overwhelmed by the flavour and creamy texture. Nice, fresh chicken slices, no fat or 'strange' bits. Good noodles. I'll be back (although I live 2 blocks away)."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time Tuesday night. I was afraid that it would be a long wait, but as others wrote, it wasn't much long of a wait for tables of two.  Everyone that works there was so happy and exuberant. They truly seem like they enjoy their job and craft. Everyone greets you as you walk through the doors and they all say farewell as you leave (all done in Japanese) As for the food. It was, interesting. I ordered the Cheese Ramen (seeing as how others were raving about it). It was mediocre to my taste. A little too salty. I wanted to play it safe and get it with Miso and not the spicy one. However the pork shoulder was delicious. The noodles were good too, had a good bite to it - not over cooked.  I'd give a 5 for atmosphere and cleanliness. 4 for service, as it was fairly difficult to communicate with our server. As for the meal, I'd give it a 2.5. If the broth were not as salty, it would have gotten a 4."}
{"text":"4.5/5.  After recommendations to try at least one Kinton Ramen location, I finally gave it a go!  I came here on a busy day (Pride weekend + this location located on Church = business be booming). Upon entering, the servers and cooks shouted something in Japanese, as they do in all Ramen restaurants I've ever been to. Luckily, my party of 2 did not have to wait long. One party had just left before our arrival, but tables that came after had to wait for up to 5 minutes. People were constantly entering and leaving - an indication of fast service. The tables by the window seat up to 3 people, and there are bar seats, as well as one long table in the front. We got a window table. There are no back rests for any chairs, so take that in mind if you need to lean back.  I immediately had to use the washroom, which was quite spacious and clean. They had tooth picks, among other things on the counter, for your use. We got two menus: one regular one, and one that had their combo (ramen+side dish) option. It took a while for us to snag down a waiter...I had to wave to them three times before they saw us. We were also sitting down, so that may have been a factor for not seeing us earlier...  I ordered the Miso Chicken Broth combo (with thick noodles, chicken breast, and additional sweet corn for +$1). I added the Age Gyoza as my side for the combo. The Age Gyoza arrived first and it was simply DELIGHTFUL. The plating was beautiful. It was a perfect crunch complemented by the light mayo drizzle. I am a bit sad because I enjoyed it more than the actual ramen! When my bowl of ramen arrived, it tasted great, but I've had better. It's better than what I've had at Markham's JTown and Ajisen, but Sansotei is still my #1. This definitely comes in second, and with the convenience of 5 locations, I'll definitely be back at Kinton! Kinton Ramen is definitely worth the try.  The Chicken Ramen combo is $13.99. With my sweet corn for $1, it came up to $14.99 plus taxes."}
{"text":"I was pretty disappointed with my dining experience at this Kinton Ramen. I've been to two other of their franchises, and this experience was pretty pathetic in comparison.   Upon entering the establishment, it was incredibly busy on a Friday evening. There was no organization whatsoever for people entering. There was a couple before my group, and three groups that walked in after us. When a server finally came to acknowledge us, someone BEHIND US swooped in to tell the server their name and party size. I was just ??? She was a snake. He took her name down and it was completely unfair to the group ahead of us, and my group. When he took our name, he told us to wait outside and he would call us. We waited about 10 minutes, with the girl behind us getting seated first. When we sat down, we all knew we wanted to order the monthly special, the Paitan Cheese Supreme for $14.99 (my party loves cheese). We had trouble hailing a server down. I definitely think they needed an extra server working. There were only 3 shaved-headed servers and a single female worker working the floor. We finally managed to get a server to come over about 5 minutes later. When our food arrived, it was tasty, but we later noticed there was no chicken in any of our dishes. We told one shaved-headed server, and he just LOOKED at the food and walked away. He didn't indicate to us if he was going to do anything about it. I slowed down my eating significantly at that point since I wanted proof that they didn't give us any chicken. After 10 minutes of inactivity/updates about our situation, I called the female server over and told her/showed her that we did not receive any chicken. She apologized. She also didn't indicate what she would do about it. About 10 minutes later, one of their cooks came over with all of our chicken on a plate, and he apologized. The chicken was very tasty, but at this point, my ramen is room temperature. I placed the chicken in my ramen and it was just an odd combo at that point since the chicken was hotter than my broth.   I wouldn't recommend this location unless you are fine with subpar customer service. That one server who didn't do anything about our missing chicken ruined my experience."}
{"text":"Delicious! Although I must admit, I have only eaten ramen at two places in Toronto - the other is definitely not worth mentioning.  So don't go being all ramen-critic-y on me.   Summary: tasty ramen and apps with friendly service and most importantly the $10 Sapporo pitchers don't hurt!  I had the pork spicy garlic, thick noodle ramen and added an egg (add $1.5 and sweet corn (add $1). The eggs are always perfectly cooked, slightly gooey inside and the sweet corn is a nice contrast to the saltiness of the broth.   I highly rate the spicy garlic broth, but be forewarned it might prevent you getting that end of date kiss, or maybe it's a good way of avoiding an unrequited one . They place a little mound of minced garlic on top of your ramen so be sure to add at your own desire.  For $2 extra we were able to get a 'combo' where an app was provided. My friend and I shared the gyoza (4 pieces) which were crispy and yum as well as the ton ton don which is seasoned/lightly sauced chopped pork on top of a mound of rice.   I thought they could have been a little more generous with the pork, not to say that I wasn't bursting at the seams by the end of my meal!! A ramen alone would be meal enough.  Atmosphere is friendly, servers and chefs welcome you in a sing song fashion upon arrival which is endearing.   Worth a shot, I believe they're a franchise, so they must be doing something right!"}
{"text":"This place is not bad.  It feels very casual but it's a bit small.    The only major complaint that I have of this place is the hygiene of the cooks.  I saw this cook wipe his hands dry on his pants and ass and then grab noodles to serve on a customer's bowl.  ewwww...  it just grossed me out."}
{"text":"Where do I start ? I lost the password to my yelp account and made a whole new account to write this review.  The food was mediocre at best (very bland), but I could have lived with that if it wasn't for the absolutely terrible service.  Firstly, the servers didn't give us water (and this happens, not a big deal!) but when we asked for water, they seemed very annoyed. The water came and they got it mixed up with the table next to us, and when those folks spoke up, the servers once again seemed frustrated and gave each other looks. Yes, there was 3 servers helping us but none of them actually seemed happy to be doing it.  I got my vegetarian ramen and I asked for hot sauce with it. They said it would a be a $1 .... okay. They then made a big deal about the fact that I didn't order a vegetarian option that already came spicy. Earlier, when I asked server # 1 about my options, she pointed to that ramen dish as the only option for me. It took 15 min for my hot sauce, Sriracha in a paper ketchup cup only half full, to arrive.  After an hour of being ignored then treated like we we were being a nuisance, we left unsatisfied."}
{"text":"*The restaurant is spacious with bar seats and a big communal table at the back. If you are sitting at the bar, you can see the entire ramen making actions. *The broth here tends to be oily even if you choose the light option. Noodles are a bit hard, and it can be considered as undercooked for some people *Just like Guu Izakaya, the atmosphere here is very loud and you will have to shout over your partner while talking  -Karaage (Special fried chicken) - $5.8:  For $6 there was only 4 pieces of karaage, which for me it's overpriced. Other than that, the karaage is pretty good with a thin and crispy batter, while the inside was juicy and tender. The sauce was a spicy ketchup sauce, instead of the usual mayonnaise, and it was quite delicious! The sauce wasn't too spicy, and I love ketchup so anything with ketchup is guuuuuuud!  -Takoyaki - $4.5:  Not my favourite. The takoyaki was very soft and doughy with one tiny piece of octopus inside.  -Spicy Jalapeno chicken ramen - $11.90:  It is definitely one of the most spiciest ramen I have had in Toronto so far, and the heat from the Jalapeno didn't give a burning sensation, it was more of a kick and lingers for a few seconds in your mouth. With that said, the broth was too oily and salty for me. The chicken was tender and cooked just right, but it was cold... Not lukewarm, just icy cold.  -Spicy Garlic Pork Ramen - $10.9:  My fried ordered the spicy garlic ramen but I have had it before. That round yellow ball in the middle is freshly grated garlic and I usually mix it into the broth. Despite the color, the ramen wasn't as spicy as the jalapeno ramen, and I found the fresh garlic to be quite strong and overpowered the broth's flavor."}
{"text":"I realize I am still addicted to Ramen.  I found this restaurant near the apartment I rent for vacation. Interior and exterior look really brand-new, so I decided to try this Ramen.  They have two kinds of broth: chicken and pork. I was satisfied with pork ramen with pork shoulder. It deserved the price. BUT when it comes to chicken Ramen, it didn't match my expectation. To be honest, I have never met good chicken ramen in the world. Why? I think the flavor of the broth can't be strong enough to make customers to finish the bowl. This is up to your favor, but for me, this chicken ramen didn't deserve to the price. I recommend pork one.  For pork ramen, it was 4 stars. but for chicken ramen, it was 2 stars.   so i gave them 3 stars. This is my honest opinion and I'll come back for their pork ramen soon"}
{"text":"One of my favourite ramen restaurants in the city. There are so many different flavours and topping to choose from, and even the type of noodle in your ramen. There are often special ramens like the cheese ramen or ramen combo that prove to be incredibly delicious every single time. Every once in a while they even hold eating competitions with jumbo ramen! :)"}
{"text":"Finally have a chance to try their reman, the atmosphere was great, like their Japanese team work style, when customer come or left, everyone will say welcome or thank you good bye in Japanese(that just what I guess cuz I know nothing about Japanese,lol) the food itself was not the best ramen I had ever tried, but still above average. I ordered a ramen combo with pork Miso soup base with chicken don, side order an dumplings as well. The soup base was kind of salty but pork was tender,  chicken don n dumplings was soso.  One thing need to mention, the open kitchen idea was great, HOWEVER, they prepare the food in front of you and lots of ingredients was put right in front of you when u sitting at the bar table. One customer sat next to me, she sneeze without cover her month, i guess all her virus goes everywhere including all the ingredients prepare for food. Also all the cooks prepare food without wearing gloves and barely see them washing hands, there is a health issues concern."}
{"text":"Quality ramen at an affordable price. Probably the best ramen I've had from a franchise spot. Great casual atmosphere and friendly service."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, the food is great, and the price is reasonable for North York standards. I usually get the regular pork broth ramen with thick noodles and extra seaweed... perfection!"}
{"text":"This is a review for the 2 Kinton Ramen places I've been to, this one (North York) and the one in downtown - Their soup base tastes like a mixture of MSG and salt, and the quality of their noodles is very low. The pork shoulder that I ordered with were nice thick slices, but they were nothing near tender and chewable."}
{"text":"Tasty chicken spicy ramen with a variety of classic combos as well as Japanese tapas.. also have two veggie ramens. Great for a effing cold Montreal day."}
{"text":"The pork tastes good! Too much garlic influenced the taste of both soup and ramen. It seems like the restaurant is too busy. Only one waitress is walking around and we waited for long time for everything. Bad judgement on attitude."}
{"text":"A nice ramen place in the Concordia area. If you're familiar with Kinka Izakaya, it definitely has the same type of vibe and all.  I had the spicy pork ramen with thin noodles and a seasoned egg. The broth was alright, but way too much garlic (and I'm a garlic lover!). The ramen comes with only two pieces of pork, delicious but disappointing nonetheless. Good amount of bouncy noodles. But oddly enough the egg was the star for me, soft-boiled and just delicious.  So overall I don't think I'd go back because the price is a bit high for what you get and it just wasn't memorable"}
{"text":"Just went to Kinton Ramen for dinner with my boyfriend. We walked in on a Monday evening at 5ish and were seated immediately.   I was happy to learn that they have gluten-free noodles here. I asked and the chef told me that they use shirataki noodles as their \"gluten-free\" option, which I loved since they're also low-carb and grain-free. Gluten-free noodles cost $2 extra, which was worth the price.   When you're ordering ramen here, you choose your broth (pork or chicken), your flavour (from a list of four different options), whether you want THIN or THICK noodles, and your preferred cut of meat (pork shoulder, belly or chicken breast). After that you can add on a number of options if you want.   We both ordered bowls of ramen - my boyfriend got the Spicy Garlic pork with pork shoulder, and I ordered the Shoyu pork also with pork shoulder. Both options are $9.80 (plus $2 for my gluten-free noodles)  My Shoyu broth was incredibly savoury - it was flavourful and rich and very satisfying (I called it a \"umami bomb\"). The garnishes - green onions, nori, a seasoned soft-boiled egg and bean sprouts paired nicely with the broth. The bean sprouts and green onions added a necessary freshness and crunch. I think it could have benefitted slightly from a hint of spice or maybe a splash of acid. The pork was very well-seasoned.   Protip: don't order appetisers unless you're really hungry. Our Tako Wasabi ($3.50) was OK, but small and completely unnecessary."}
{"text":"far below expectation! Last time when we went, we waited for 30 min to get seated and when we almost had our meals ready, there was a water break down in the kitchen and all their ppl went to fix the problem. We continued to wait for about 10 min after this incident and hopefully we could get our meals afterwards, but they were still fixing the problem. I asked one of the waitors how long we were still supposed to wait, and he replied me that they could not sell noodles at that time and we were like wtf, then why didn't u tell us like at least 5 mins ago, not till we asked...then too bad we had to leave after almost 40 min wait.  and today we went again, having the high expectation that the noodle will really worth the wait.  This time we went early, didnt have to wait and after we got our meals, I ordered the Shio Ramen and my firend ordered Shoyu Ramen, they both look mediocore, and they indeed tasted below mediocore. Mine has sea salt in it,  it was very salty and salty was the only flavour I could taste, my firend's had soybean in it and soybean was the only flavour she could taste. The egg and nori were probably the best among the bunch. The noodle itself was ok, but I have tasted better noodles then this before, they could do better.    And after we finished our noodle, we havent signaled the waitors for bill, the waitors came twice to ask if they could take our bowls, but indeed we haven't finished eating yet, we just finished the noodles. They just went to the table to rush us, for twice!  So overall the experience was far below our expectation! Right now, the only thing I feel after this meal is to drink a lot of water,  the soup was hell salty!!!!"}
{"text":"I'm really perplexed in reviewing Kinton Ramen. I haven't been there before but I decided to eat lunch from there using Uber Eats. I was excited to try their food and try the app at the same time.  The order was placed at around noon and we had an expected delivery time at around 12:50. It was a bit long, but given the time we ordered I could completely understand they they might be busy and could take longer.  I saw the expected delivery time change a bunch of times and it got longer and longer. At about an hour and 20 minutes it was well past any fault that was excusable.   I put a call through Uber Eats and they told me it was still listed as being put together (I find it hard to believe that this was the case but it's the story the restaurant came up with). As soon as that call went through our delivery MAGICALLY made it's progression to on its way to us (Finally).  The delivery was relatively quick, but I can't help but speculate that our order got lost in the mix and we were forgotten. My order was mixed up as well which I didn't appreciate either.  Like some of the complaints that I'm seeing of their broth, it's a little on the salty side. The ramen overall does it's best and I would say that it's a step above Kinton Ramen. But I think that the praise for the ramen in this location is over hyped. I was really upset with the level of service today. Not on Uber but the restaurant.   Will I go here again? In all honesty, probably. But this experience has left a really \"salty\" taste in my mouth (pun intended), so that visit may have to wait. Until then though my fellow readers!"}
{"text":"The place is small, but decorated in a very cute way. my favorite part was the rustic detail and wooden stools we used as chairs. The place is very fast paced. I went on the Halloween weekend, and the resto had a Mickey Mouse theme, so everyone was dressed in some sort of mickey or mini outfit (in a very cute and Japanese way ^_^)   They do not take reservations, but the wait time was about 15 minutes. The servers are polite and greeted me in Japanese which I thought was a nice touch to my experience (Almost felt like I was in Japan...LOL). I had the Miso Pork Ramen with Gyoza and Takoyaki Mmm. Sooo good. It was a cold fall day, so all the warm food and soupy goodness hit the spot."}
{"text":"Great ramen. Haven gone a couple of times now and always enjoy both the pork and chicken. Not a lot of seating so it can be busy but worth the wait."}
{"text":"Ramen being one of my fave foods, I've had it all over the world, including Japan. I usually go on a crazy Japanese food rampage when I go to places like NYC, SF or Sydney  because TO's Japanese food scene is almost nonexistent.  LIke other reviews pointed out, Kinton is authentic but mediocre by international standards.  For TO, however, it is the best ramen I've had in the city.  Having been disappointed numerous times over the years, (weak noodles swimming in soy sauce +water =broth... yuck!), I had all but given up on ramen in Toronto.  Hopefully, TO's enthusiasm towards places like Kinton and Guu will prompt more authentic Japnese restauranteurs to invest in our city!"}
{"text":"A million times yes!! I've been trying waiting for Kinton to open in Markham and it exceeds my expectations. I got a pork original for $10.99 and my God was it heavenly.   Presentation was on point. Waiters were attentive to the customers (knew when I was ready to order as I put the menu away, filled my cup when it was empty, friendly and smiling).   Definitely bringing more people with me when i come back"}
{"text":"Came here with three of my friends. Got a good seat with quick service. I got the pork spicy garlic and substituted the pork with chicken and it tasted amazing! I'm a ramen lover and this one beats every ramen I've tried. Wish I had some pics but it was too delicious to have time to snap a pic. One of my friends finished the whole bowl so they gave my friend a points card and took a picture with us with silly hats. It was pretty funny. Very great place!! Even the workers chant when anyone walks in. What a way to welcome you =) great place. Highly recommend if you're a ramen fan!! =)"}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night, wasn't too busy although we did wait about 10 mins for a table for 4. They don't take reservations so I do recommend you save yourself a little time there to wait on a busy night. The service was awesome the people there are genuinely caring and look like they enjoy working there (smiley and positive attitudes in a restaurant is always pleasant and refreshing). I got the vegetarian ramen and I really enjoyed it! I was a little skeptical about how the tofu would be served but to my delight it was presented as a nice crisp NUGGET! which as a vegetarian, let's face it, I'm missing out on nugget shaped foods... My only little complaint would be that the broth was overly salted but that is coming from a person who generally doesn't eat very salty to start. Overall a great experience and would come here again and recommend it to a friend:) Thanks Kinton Ramen!"}
{"text":"Clean atmosphere and nice friendly staff. I love that you can see the cooks making the food with the steam rising.   Chili chiki don was very pleasing to the pallet. The mayo space was just the right combination of flavours.   Kinton bun was a nice bite to have as a starter. The chicken was very crisp and flavourful."}
{"text":"Kinton Ramen is the answer to all your vegan ramen prayers. Rejoice my fellow herbivores and carnivores alike. The ramen gods have listened and their answer is Kinton's Goma salad ramen. This is not your typical ramen and is more of a cold noodle dish. It's both refreshing and flavourful. I adore this ramen and it's such a unconvential take on a staple dish. The ramen comes with vegetables and corn and I've come back many times and have never changed my order. Also, the Tofu-furai is one of the best apps you can order. I would compare them to veganized (tofu/soy) based chicken nuggets. It's such a delightful treat and I order them any time I feel like indulging.   The decor is very Japanese modern and the staff is super friendly. I've come back time and time again because I absolutely adore this one dish. The only reason it doesn't get a full five stars is because the vegetarian options are very limited. But other than that, one of the best ramen places in Montréal."}
{"text":"We went here for Saturday lunch. The Kinton Ramen location was nicely decorated. The staff was very friendly and enthusiastic. But the background music was too loud and the constant staff yelling got to be annoying.  I ordered the pork ramen with extra corn. My friend ordered the chicken ramen. The dishes were both pretty good and delicious.  Would we go back? Probably since there isn't that many ramen restaurants in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Really disappointed!!! If you want good ramen go else where.  But if you want garlic soup then stay inline."}
{"text":"This is my fourth time at this place. The quality is well kept and service is great. I had tried both pork and chicken in various occasion and I find the chicken broth is more to my liking. The chicken broth is creamy but not as thick as pork. The noodle is perfectly cooked. The chicken breast is very tender and flavorful. Unfortunately the portion is very small. The egg can be cooked a bit less as I like the yolk be a bit runny. The menu is rather limited but all I want is a hot bowl of ramen so I am fine with that. It is soon become my staple ramen stop whenever I come to downtown Toronto."}
{"text":"ramen classique au poulet est toujours une bonne idée  pour une première  visite mais déjà  un habitué  de Kinka izakaya et c'était  à la hauteur  de leur réputation.  Le bouillon etait delicieux et savoureux genereuse portion de nouilles fines  et de tendres morceaux de poulet. Tout le staff est toujours soriant et attentionné.  Good job guys!"}
{"text":"Loved the Ramen! Had a good texture and the broth was creamy. The level of salt is a little bit much but you can always ask them to make it less salty while placing the order. They had other dishes too, but just the Ramen is good enough as it's a good portion for most people. Level of service is good, greetings are interesting as they yell a greet in Japanese as you walk in and out of the restaurant to give a feel of Japanese culture. :)"}
{"text":"Americans may have a reputation for enjoying their red meat, but not when it comes to chicken. The crispy outter layer of the chicken kaarage enticed my husband to take a big chewy bite, only to drop that chunk back into the basket when he saw the gray meat, outlined in red juices inside.   BUT they still get 4 stars because they took it back and refried it to a safe-to-eat texture and color. And when done right, and dipped in that mayo that comes with it, it was delectable!   Plus, the burnt miso and my spicy chicken ramen were deceptively delicious! While the latter was a creamy white broth that appeared wholesome and harmless, it packed the punch of the sliced jalepenos and the former, a seemingly seething orange, ended up being mild enough for our 4yo to enjoy (while waiting for the kaarage).   This was our first taste of Montreal and it's setting our expectations (cautiously) high for the food scene here!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, great food. Noodles are the best I've had in Toronto, they're like... actually chewy. Pork is delicious as well, and I love how you have the option of loading your soup up with pork fat (light, regular, rich).  Only downside: potentially long line. If you get there between 7pm-8pm, expect to wait one hour. In general I only go there either late at night or at 11:30am when there's no line up.  I usually get the Extra Pork Kinton Ramen since you basically get 3x the pork for 3 more dollars."}
{"text":"This ramen place is a really good spot if you want a solid pork ramen. I've been here many times and would recommend the pork original ramen as the other broths are not that great. However, the pork original is indeed a very rich, delicious broth and the pork is good as well. The seasoned eggs which are a staple of a good ramen are relatively bland, which takes away from the ramen. Overall 4/5 because the ramens other than the pork original are underwhelming. I haven't tried the chicken ramen or some of their special creations, but have heard good thigs."}
{"text":"I received quick and friendly service at lunch hour for a sit down. I had the original ramen du porc. It was good and in good portion. I enjoyed it. You get a whole egg which was a nice surprise because most places, esp. living in NYC you get half!"}
{"text":"Worst service I ever experienced at kinton.   The restaurant was only 80% full and there was plenty of bar seats left. But the hostess refused to give me a table for two because my boyfriend wasn't here yet. He was literally just parking outside the store on the side of the street. The waiter kept on asking me where he was. Like dude is it necessary to be so pushy. Like 2 minutes doesn't kill. You don't need to ask me 3 times where he is. Rude, pretty much killed my mood.   We ordered the miso ramen and the black shoyu tonkatsu. Felt like the broth of both the ramens are not strong enough and the extra meat portion over here is less than the other kinton.   Also ordered the hot karaage. The chicken was juicy and fresh but the flavour was overpowered by the hot sauce. The sauce was spicy and sour.   Ramen was average. Service was horrible."}
{"text":"This is probably my favourite location of all the kinton ramen stores. The broth here seems to be a lot better. I feel like the flavour here is a little different from the other locations. It's thicker and stronger here. The pork here is also not as dry. It's really soft. Portions here are about the same as the other locations but for extra pork, there's only one more piece.  Chik Chik don is always pretty good. It would have been better if the chicken on top of the rice was warmer and if there was more sauce.  If you decide to order drinks here, make sure you ask for no ice. I ordered an ice tea and it was pretty much 90% ice and 10% tea... order no ice to get the most of your drink!   Service here varies. Sometimes the waiters are friendly and nice. Other times they don't seem like they want to be there.    As for parking, there's a Green P parking lot located behind the street that the restaurants at but it's really close by."}
{"text":"The ramen was ok.  What was silly was the stamp card.  No one explained how it works to us.  I was almost done my soup and had I known, that if finished it, I would get a stamp.  They should see that you're almost done, to remind you to finish to get a stamp card. They never checked and when I asked for a card, they said \"I don't remember you finishing\" if you didn't tell me or remember I could have lied... it's kind of over priced for the portions you get."}
{"text":"Authentic feel and delicious bowls of ramen.  I like my ramen simple and they do it right. Straight forward to order. You get what you expect and the extra ingredients are plentiful if you want to spice it up. Can just get a bit expensive if you want to stray outside the standard bowl."}
{"text":"Great place.  Atmosphere is great, its quite busy but rather 'good' busy. You wont come here to hold a serious conversation with someone, but rather to catch up or just hang out with an old friend or significant other.  Service is also great, most of the time, you will be served and eating your Ramen within 15-20 minutes. But don't be alarmed if this takes longer as your service will vary depending on how busy it is.   Food is great. Broth is rich and authentic. Ramen noodles are also great, firm and chewy. The only downside is their meats. Both chicken and pork can definitely improve, I could instantly tell its of a lower quality (definitely pre-cooked meats reheated and served with each order).   I would encourage everyone to order side dishes with each bowl of Ramen. Side dishes at Kinton are authentic and delicious, especially the gyozas.  Great place, fair price and great service.  4/5"}
{"text":"Got the chicken with original. Generally fine but nothing to write home about. Noodles a bit undercooked and lacked flavour. Broth was 'creamy' but had a slight after taste of flour. Soft spiced egg was tasty.   Great location, nice interior and good service."}
{"text":"After a year and many many visit and many stamp on my kinton bowler card, their quality have dropped a lot since they first opened. Sometimes the soup do get a bit too salty sometimes the thick noodle are undercooked and still hard in the center.   Their service are always on task 90% of the timel.  It's better of the 2 ramen store within short walking distance of y and e station so if I would still go there for a ramen fix but Hokkaido ramen santouka is about to open 400m south of y and e station maybe I'll go there for my ramen fix once it opens.  I gave 2 and half Stars out of 5 is that after 43 bowls of stamp on my card (all at this location ) I have more bad to mediocre bowl of ramen than yummy I want more ones."}
{"text":"Had the cold ramen.  It was alright, not great, not bad. Too many sesame seeds, would have been nice to have a balance with a splash of toasted sesame oil.  The place gets crazy busy but I think it's just because of the aesthetic of the place.  The modern, industrial finish of the store frame seems to be a huge draw.    The service is quick and friendly, kitchen staff are fast and get orders out while the soup is still boiling.  I wouldn't go back though, nothing to impress me that would take me back."}
{"text":"Made an account specifically to depict how horrible my experience was.  I've been waiting to try this place out as I am a lover of ramen and my friends have been hyping it up. I couldn't even get to try the noodles as the service was so completely horrible I had to leave.   Me and 6 other friends came in at 5pm (restaurant was pretty empty) but they were unwilling to seat us as we were waiting for an extra person. The girl waitress glared at us, pointed us to the seat policy, and left us standing by the door, even though we asked to be seated separately (6 of us at first, and the last person was the girlfriend of one, so they could be seated separately together). she rudely told us \"no\" and we were left standing at the door not knowing what to do.   When our 8th showed up, another waiter came up to us, albeit he was a lot nicer than the other waitress, told us they had no table for 8 yet (again they didn't want to let us sit separately), and told us to wait outside and he would get us in 20 minutes(understandable it was a small restaurant). We waited 1 hour+ while they repeatedly seated other people coming in. When we checked in after 30 minutes he said \"15 more minutes\".  It was fairly obvious they had no plans to seat us and only wanted to get rid of us from their front door. At around 7pm we went to eat at a sushi restaurant nearby.   Whatever! Never coming back, you lost yourself a potential long term customer."}
{"text":"The ramen here is really good. I especially like the spicy one, can't remember what it's called. And it's easily accessible for those of us who live uptown!"}
{"text":"My first restaurant ramen experience and Kinton didn't disappoint.  Servers were friendly as they guided me through the menu options.  The place is small but well lit, warm and trendy. Service is fast - we ordered and in no time our large bowls of ramen, broth, vegetables and chicken arrived at our table. I also placed an order for fried chicken. It was HOT and greasy - so be prepared. But delicious.  You'll be sitting on a backless chair but you are still comfortable.  The staff yell out their appreciation for your patronage by way of thanking you for coming as you exit the establishment. You learn to get used to it as you talk with your dinner companion.  All in all - a great experience and highly recommended."}
{"text":"There was much hype about this place during the first few weeks of opening, decided to try it out only to find a looooong line up at the door. I'm not a big fan of waiting for food unless it's absolutely amazing. (I only have a very few selection of restaurants in Toronto)  After a couple of months, thought I'd give it a try. This time, no line up, there were even a few empty seats which was a bit surprising. Where did all those people go?  You can choose the thickness of your soup base and which part of meat you wanted, shoulder or belly, both pork. Ah, this place only serves pork bone based soup and pork is the only choice of meat.  I ordered a Cheese Ramen, which was just some mozzarella cheese on a fairly basic ramen.   First of all, Ramen is evaluated by the following order: 1. Soup 2. Noodle 3. Meat / ingredient  The soup was...i would call it a failure. They use pork bone and cook it in a big pot to get the broth, for whatever reason they failed to get rid of the stinky smell from the pork bones. What made it worse is that they tried to mask it with sodium, yes that is SALT. I don't think I've ever tried such soup that's stinky and salty.  Noodle was nothing to rave for either. Honestly, I couldn't tell the difference between the noodles from here and noodles from Su & Shi, which is hooooorrible.  The only decent part of my meal was the pork shoulder in the soup. It was very tendor, although it also did still manage to retain some of the gaminess from the soup.  All in all, I am surprised by the initial hype this place had. But eventually I guess people started noticing that it didn't live upto it's hype, hence the no line up at the door.  I would give Kenzo, which is pretty much the only competitor in Toronto, a 4/10. I would give Kinton 3/10. Sad."}
{"text":"Salty.  Ramen is about the broth, why cover the flavor with so much salt.  Needed to drink water all day long to balance it out.  For dinner had congee, also for balancing.  Not much in terms of toppings.  To add you may bring a bowl of noodles from $11 to $15-$16.  For things like premade corn.  Many things I would rather spend on than this.  Coming here be prepared for 5% protein, 95% carbs, 100% too salty."}
{"text":"Nice ramen place with customizable broths (miso, shio, and spicy for both pork and chicken) and toppings. Cute and simple decor and always a safe choice for a crowd. Highly recommended for ramen lovers!"}
{"text":"My boss is obsessed about Kinton Ramen lol. And since we work across the street, we always end up eating here every other week for lunch... is this even healthy? lmao.... it sure slows me down at work after because of major itis lol.  Funny thing, he often challenges us to finish the whole bowl of ramen, soup and all, so that he (we) could collect more stamps lol. 1 bowl = 1 stamp. Just letting you know if you are reading this, boss, we still have a LONG way to go from 1,000 stamps for that $1,000 Gift card lol.  I try to stay away from the fatty pork, so I usually order chicken. Not bad actually... meat is very soft and tender. I tried the Chicken Miso Ramen (asked for less salt) and it was delicious. My all time favourite would probably be the Chicken Spicy Jalapano Ramen. I love that spicy x creamy soup base. But that one would be a bit hard to down at the end for that one stamp lol.  I also really enjoyed the Chikichiki Don. It is chopped chicken breast with Kinton original mayo sauce on rice. Simple but definitely one of my favourite appetizers because it is semi torched :) I shall try the Tonton Don (chopped pork with Kinton original sauce on rice) next time.  Service has always been fast and courteous. I guess I will be back again very soon for another stamp lol."}
{"text":"Had the shoyu ramen pork....the broth was a bit too salty and had a metallic tinge to it....the noodles were good and while decor was great I won't be back....."}
{"text":"Best Ramen in town! Amazing. The spicy garlic with thick noodles and seasoned egg is amazing! With Swiss cheese. Very good. I go here every Friday. I love the Ramen here."}
{"text":"I personally think the one in Markham and Yonge street offer better service.  I walked in and none of the servers acknowledged me. They didnt seem to give a shit about people coming in or leaving at all."}
{"text":"Just your average ramen. I've been here a couple times and compared to the Richmond hill location I find that this specific kinton beats the richmond hill location. I ordered their February special ramen which wasn't anything special. Their original karage which comes in a smaller portion compared to the Richmond hill location. It's a good place for a ramen fix but definitely nothing out of the ordinary. I was honestly the most disappointed when it came down to the service. I waved down a server, her and I made two second eye contact and she still decided to ignore me... nonetheless my order was wrong and I told them they messed up but instead they questioned me... I'm not saying that customers are always right but that's definitely not how a server should approach and talk to the customer.... after my last visit I'm not really sure I want to ever come back..."}
{"text":"Service was slow . Our appetizer felt like it was sitting in the window for ten minutes before given to us...we had the fried calamari which was barely warm when it reached the table. Other than that, it was pretty good. The ramen was consistent quality as the other locations which is always a plus when eating at a chain. However like their other locations, expect a bit of a wait time when coming in prime hours."}
{"text":"Food was OK. Nothing special. The octopus ball was disappointing. Service was very slow. Will not be going back again."}
{"text":"Enjoy the Japanese language shouting between waitresses and cookers as part of they tradition to welcome/farewell and thank the customers!! Great super fresh Pork or Chicken Ramen. They offer with 5 combinations of broth. Spicy Garlic is strongly recommended. Price is between 11$ ave. per ramen. You can sit by the bar, 2 persons table or share the only big table they have, which is certainly not a problem."}
{"text":"Love Kinton. I feel the quality isn't as good as when it opened (was definitely a 5 star then) but it's authentic and delicious. Recommend heavy miso and pork belly, with a nap afterwards!"}
{"text":"I've been craving ramen for way over a month, but for some reason haven't gotten to it. We decided to go in New Year's Day, because it was cold and that obviously merits a warm bowl of ramen!  I've been to the Shepard and Yonge Kinton Ramen location, but this one seemed to be closer to me. I always go with the chicken Shoyu with extra corn and garlic. I love the somewhat creamy texture of the soup with thin noodles. The chicken is always a bit questionable to me, since it just looks so...perfectly flat. However, I enjoy it every time, so I do not complain.   My boyfriend decided to get their house special on HWY 7, which was the Mabo tofu ramen. It's a miso pork broth with chilli bean paste with ground pork, tofu, eggplant and scallion. You could make it spicier by adding hot sauce, but my bf found it hot enough. He finished his bowl, so I assume it was delicious. Unfortunately I didn't taste it, as I am sick.   We also ordered a side of their gyoza and kimchi. Loved every bite of both.   Overall, the restaurant is easily accessible with plenty of parking space. It's actually quite large and can accommodate many people unlike their uptown and downtown locations that are much smaller. Service and food are great.   I'll definitively be coming back here to get my ramen fix on!"}
{"text":"Tasty hand made noodles with a great texture and flavor. Very refreshing tasty drinks at a very good price...Can't wait to return!!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch around 2 pm and this place was packed. There were some seats by the bar and another long shared table by the window. We chose the window seats. We ordered the miso ramen and the shoyu ramen.   The noodle were the right texture, not too soft and a bit chewy still. The soup base for shoyu ramen was very good, slightly less salty when compared to the santouka soup base. The pork belly was nothing special though.  My brother had the miso ramen but he didn't find it to be specially good. He liked the soup base but thought that it would probably have been tastier had he gone for the spicy soup base instead.   We were served quite quickly and the food also arrived very fast. I do think that I am giving it an extra half star for the efficient and courteous service. Would go back."}
{"text":"Best ramen place I've tried. The broth and noodles taste homemade, and the portions are just the right size. Service was really quick and the staff was super friendly. Everything is also customizable, which is a plus. I had the original flavoured chicken ramen with thick noodles. Amazing. I'll definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Ramen is one of my favorite things in the world. I used to work in NYC and Totto Ramen midtown east was one of the favorite places I used to go at least once a week. After transferring to Toronto this September, I have been eager to find a ramen place to replace Totto's rich and thick chicken broth and its charred charsiu.  And I found it. This is the place. I tried the original pork here as I always try the clean broth my first time at ramen places because then they got nowhere to hide behind the spices and seasonings. It was rich, creamy, packed with pork bone flavor (mustve been cooking long time to get that kind of deep bone flavor). shoulder meat and charred pork bellies were both so awesome. I loved that they gave two kinds of meat just for the sake of diversity. I got extra noodles for $1.9 which I usually always do but it was kind of strange that you have to ask for this when you first order as at other places I can usually order later. One disappointment had to be the waitress suggestion of thick noodles. I should have known but with cleaner broth, always go with thin noodles as more broth per noodle quantity per bite in your mouth so that each bite is balanced and better flavored. The thick noodles kept distracting me from the broth. Obviously with miso and spicy ones, thick noodles will do. I was extremely happy that I found a good ramen place I can return for a fix. I am definitely glad I tried this place after feeling so hopeless after trying Sansotei ramen (first time I didnt get extra noodles from a ramen place - flavor was simple, artificial, extremely salty and bitter tang at the end of each bite). I hope next time the broth is just as good at kinton and cant wait. I dont need good service for a good bowl of ramen but just to comment, they are nice but inattentive. Never fills up my water unless I ask them to."}
{"text":"This place is located right next to Kinka Izakaya (formally Guu).   Place is well lit with an open kitchen.  There menu also have small bites (gyoza, karage, takoyaki, etc) as well as beer and sake.  Tried their spicy ramen which was not very spicy.  There's something I can't pinpoint but the soup was lacking the umami flavor and richness I have experienced from Ipuddo and other ramen houses in NYC (sorry).  Overall it did satisfy my ramen craving.  Would come try something else next time."}
{"text":"This is one of the many kinton ramens located throughout the city.  Overall, I find that the quality and taste is consistent with the chain. Although kinton is not my favourite go-to place for ramen, it is still satisfying."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  I love the trendy interior design of this place along with cozy buzzling atmosphere.  The staff will for time to time do a loud chant and creates such an engaging experience!  The ramen, the soup and the artistically torched cha siu that they present in a bowl of tastiness wins me every time!"}
{"text":"I often come here for work lunch. However, this time Kinton has disappointed me and I'll never eat here again. I ordered a specialty noodle, and after a couple minutes waitress came and told me that they are out of black fungus. I asked if it can be replaced with any other topping and the waitress shook head in a disbelief way. So I ended up paying the same price but getting less content for what I order, and the waitress acted like if I were stupid or something. That's just blows my mind of how they do business. Just imagine you buy a computer and they tell you \"Hey, we are out of this type of graphic cards and you will neither get a replacement nor get a discount\"."}
{"text":"A bit of a disappointment to be honest when compared to Kinton Ramen in Toronto. All the food we ordered was off. The tamago, while had good flavour, was overcooked. The thin ramen was overlooked by a little it seems. The soup base for the original flavour did not taste like the one in Toronto. It seemed \"water-downed\", very little flavour in the soup. The rice used for the Ton Ton Don and the Chiki Chiki Don did not have the consistency that one would associate with Japanese rice. It's missing the gelatin-ness/ stickiness that one would found in Japanese rice. I wonder if the rice served was old. It had similar consistency of fried rice. Overall, disappointed with my visit. Guess I will stick with the one in Toronto."}
{"text":"I've been to downtown several times. The quality and atmosphere are great even though space is small. It has come to my attention that the newly opened location uptown Richmond hill had many not-so-good comments because of the super slow service and lacklustre soup base. I tried it during non peak hour 3:30pm with only 2 tables having customer. I had a very great customer service. In less then 8 mins I had my dream ramen order - shoyu pork soup base. Soup base had a strong original favour with shoyu taste. Thin noodles were relatively well done, smooth but chewy. Although they only served 2 so-thin slices the Pork was so soft and melts in your mouth! The meat were bigger before in down town. My only complaint is that you needed to pay extra for add-ons. Just for a few pieces of fungus, corn and eggs  (which should be included anyway) made the total price ramp up to almost $14. I ate lots of ramen in Japan and they always fill plenty of veggies on the side with the price definitely cheaper too. Anyways, if you want to go there, go during non peak hour. Finally a bit annoying background music is too loud !!!"}
{"text":"I have a confession to make. The first time I had ramen, was one month ago. I know! Have I been living under a rock?! It was only after watching David Chang on Mind of a Chef, did I become determined to try out ramen and see what all the fuss was about.  With interest now high, I hit another obstacle - where do I go?? There are so many options! So off I went to Yelp, BlogTo and other popular food websites to see which they considered to be the best ramen restaurant. So after some internal back and forth, I decided to go with Kinton Ramen. And conveniently, a Kinton Ramen had such opened down the street from me on Church Street (it is a chain).  6 friends and I decided to pay them a visit on a Saturday for lunch, and we arrived just as they opened - so seating was not an issue. As I usually do, I had already reviewed the menu, and knew what I wanted to order. As each friend arrived, we ordered tea - it was a really cold day, and the only warm drink on their menu were a variety of teas. Though not much of a tea drinker, I was still impressed with the teas they offered (can't find the list of teas online - but trust me, they were unique, tasty and good value at $2).  When the conversation turned to what each person was gonna order, people's interest's ranged from chicken and pork for their meat, to spicy garlic, miso and original broth. I was definitely not interested in the chicken option because the white onion was a turn off. Interestingly, or may stupidly, I decided to get the spicy garlic broth instead of the original, which goes against everything I stand for when it comes to trying a new restaurant or a new cuisine. And that is, \"order the original, what they are known for, or keep it simple.\" But the spicy garlic sounded so good, so I went with it - bad idea. I really did not care for the flavour and could not understand why people enjoyed ramen so much. I found that the garlic flavour was not clear, but muted, and it was not spicy enough. I am not saying it was inedible - but it was a dish that took me all day to finish (ate some at the restaurant and took the rest home). The noodles themselves were delicious, and the chicken karaage that I got on the side was decent (Kinka Izakaya, next door, sells my favorite). The friends I was with enjoyed their dishes, but weren't blown away. Since I had been the only person who had never had ramen before, I was the only person that could not use an example of a better ramen restaurant in the city. But apparently there are many great ones. With that in mind, I must try ramen again somewhere else, and get the original next time."}
{"text":"FINALLY! a Japanese restaurant that serves Hiyashi Chuka . I've searched high and low for any restaurant that would serve this summer noodle dish for A-WHILE now and none of the Japanese restaurants in this side of the GTA serves it  (If you know something I dont , please enlighten me with a message). In my search for this all time childhood dish I was a bit disappointed that though some knows of it not a single one serves HC until now. I guess probably because Toronto is a cold city, therefore hot piping ramen is preferred.   I've known of Kinton for a bit now , have tried their ramen and dont really prefer it over some of the other spots. Their sign introducing some cold noodles series stopped me on my tracks. I knew I just have to try it.  Hence the reason for this review. The base is quite similar to a Salad Dressing, you dont need much of it, would easily cover the noodles. Kinton's Hiyashi though did not hit the spot i was looking for but I welcomed the variety they've done anyway . Adding sesame paste instead of the yellow hot mustard was something I didnt think would go well but it wasnt bad either. The Chuka noodle itself I found a bit on the hard side , I think they got overly excited to serve and had stopped the noodles cooking process a wee bit sooner. For $10 the portion was good for two. We ordered the Spicy Karaage and the dishes made a good pairing. Overall I would give the restaurant a 3.5 but had given the extra .5 because they were the first to bring my favorite dish to the GTA. Keep up improving Kinton ."}
{"text":"I love ramen and haven't been to this location before and decided to come with my ball hockey team after a big win (this is where you cheer).   Price Range (Not including Tax or Tip): $12 for ramen, $17 for double meat ramen and $4-$9 for appetizers. Price on par with other ramen places.   Food Quality (Taste, Portion Size, Menu): 2.5/5 I had the Karaage and Pork Shoyu with Extra Pork. I definitely thought I was hungier than I was, I was so full after. They weren't lying when they said extra pork, the serving size was a lot. The noodle to meat ratio was pretty good because it was extra meat. The Karage was a good portion as well, the prices were pretty big. I liked the taste of the karage as well, it was pretty crispy and had flavour. I wasn't a big fan of the ramen. The broth and noodles were good but the pork didn't have much flavour to it and tasted dry. To be honest, I like Sansotei way better. The menu has a decent amount of ramen options, with a lot of different appetizers.   Atmosphere:3/5 Wooden everything. It look likes like all other ramen places but it's bigger than the ones you see near Yonge and Finch or Downtown. It's pretty compact but you expect that from a ramen resto. We had a table of 7 and fortunately it wasn't overly busy so we got a table with a small wait. If you're coming with a big group I'd call ahead of time to see if they take reservations. The plaza is pretty crowded since it has a lot of food/drink places, so parking might be difficult during busy times but they have underground parking as well.   Service: 2.5/5 The staff was nice and courteous. It always rubs me the wrong way when staff give you an issue for splitting the check. They only allow it to be split in 4 ways, and kind of gave us some problems when my friends tried to split their pitcher. One of the other staff members came over and did it which was good but was kinda confused why splitting was an issue. They didn't come in much to check on how the meal was going or to fill water. The food came out pretty quick, and they brought all our stuff together which I appreciated.   Would I go there again? If Sansotei is an option that night probably not. I would go if I really wanted ramen and didn't have many other options or if a friend REALLY wanted to go.   Lash's Reccomendations  If you're going to get an appetizer, don't get double meat ramen, it is way too much food.   Karaage - I don't think i need to explain why you should get this. If you enjoy spicy food, I'd recommend their spicy option of it."}
{"text":"Although my friends and I were having trouble finding the restaurant, we somehow managed to find it.   My friend order takoyaki (battered fried octopus balls) with tonkatsu sauce and mayo, which was about $5.5 and it was great. Although, just be mindful to wait for it to cool down, since they are usually served right after it's cooked. I ordered the Original Chicken that included sea salt, white onions, nori, scallions, chicken breast, and a seasoned egg. I was very impressed with the flavours and the tenderness of the chicken breast. I can be very picky with the thickness of the noodles I eat, but what I appreciated was that they gave an option of either thin or thick noodles.  The restaurant was very spacious, but the stools are quite small, so it may be a little difficult to sit on. But other than that, I really enjoyed what great service and food I received."}
{"text":"First time doing ramen and was pleasantly surprised how delicious it was, staff fast and very helpful about what to order. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Kinton Ramen has always been my favourite ramen spot in the city! I've been going here since the first Kinton location in Toronto opened on Baldwin. My go-to order is always the spicy garlic ramen with extra pork. It's amazing! So much flavour. I always have it with an extra serving of corn. I read a previous review saying that adding swiss cheese to the spicy garlic ramen tastes good too - I will try that combination the next time I go.  During my most recent trip to Kinton, I also ordered my favourite Kinton cocktail - Momo. It's a peach cocktail and very yummy!  That being said, I feel like this location's portions are smaller than that of other Kinton locations. The broth in my ramen was JUST ENOUGH, meaning that I had to hold back from slurping down too much broth as I was afraid that I will be left with no broth and lots of noodles towards the end. As well, my cocktail was only 1/3 glass full! In the other locations, I clearly remember the glass being at least 1/2 - 3/4 full. Maybe Kinton is starting to cut down on their portions all across their locations....  They did give me a generous amount of corn which I paid extra for, but at least it's not the Mickey Mouse amount that I'm used of getting at other ramen places whenever I order an additional topping of corn.  The food is delicious nonetheless.  Service is always energetic and friendly."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised to finally eat ramen. $11 a bowl either pork or chicken. Add another 2 and you get a side with it. I had the original pork belly ramen and it was very good! Flavorful and savoury... Mmmmm I wish there was more meat though!   Also got the octopus balls for an extra $1 with the combo. Pretty good too. Make sure to wash it all down with their homemade lemonade $3. Deeeelicious  I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"I am excited to find another great ramen spot in the city!   With ramen restaurants popping up like crazy, it's easy to find mediocre ramen and that's just not the case with Kinton. When we arrived on a Wednesday evening, the place was pretty busy but we were seated immediately. Like the Guu restaurants, the cooks and servers yell some Japanese pleasantries to everyone who walks in/leaves the restaurant, I suppose it's fun, but I've seen it before so the novelty wasn't really there for me.   Our server quickly took our orders. We opted to try the miso pork ramen and the original ramen as well as the chicken don and gyoza. These items come with the ramen as a set for maybe $2-$3 more than the regular price so it's a good deal! Plus you can add a drink for $1-$2 and dessert for another $3. We also opted for a drink, the lemonade drink which was actually amazing.   The chicken don was actually really good but it was definitely unusual and unlike any don I've had before. It's almost like cold chicken salad on top of a bed of hot rice. It was strange at first bite but I actually really liked the combination of flavours so I'd get that again. The gyoza were also above average, I enjoyed the sweet sauce they were served with. The ramen was great, the original broth was creamy and flavourful and had the right amount of saltiness. The miso was good too, seasoning is perfect and great flavour. The pork inside the bowls was a nice portion, as were the toppings inside. The different ramens seem to have different toppings, the original had the seasoned egg while the miso did not, and the miso came with corn while I had to add it to my original. The topping descriptions aren't on the menu which prompted a lot of questions for the servers.   The restaurant is trendy looking, it's not large so I wouldn't recommend coming in with a large group. There's maybe one table that can accommodate a group larger than 2 or 3. There's a large bar where you can overlook the kitchen which is pretty fun. The stools you sit on are pretty uncomfortable though, so it's definitely not a place you want to spend hours in.   Service was good for the most part, the only issue we had was getting the bill, we had asked for the bill and then our server was seen taking several more orders, bringing people their food/drinks, talking to people at the bar, etc... so we had to ask another server to bring it to us, and then minutes later we received two bills. No big deal, but that was the only issue with service. Otherwise everything was great.   I noticed they have cold dipping ramen and a freezing ramen which has a slush base. Not sure if I'm brave enough to try one of those but it's definitely an interesting concept, especially for us ramen lovers who will crave ramen in the middle of the summer.   I will definitely be back when I need my ramen fix. The karaage looked pretty good so I'd definitely give that a try next time!"}
{"text":"Came here on a dark rainy day and was so lucky that they had megarame challenge that day! It was so exciting and amusing watching people eating a giant bowl of ramen within 15 mins! Unfortunately there were no one succeeded during our stay... For the food, we ordered shoyu ramen and original karaage (my friend don't eat spicy)which was a pity because I think it's not as good as the spicy one. They have various choices of extra toppings, but I found the broth and the pork slice was greasy which made my stomach uncomfortable...  Staffs were so cool and nice and everybody there was enthusiastic!"}
{"text":"This place has pretty good ramen, but the only reason I can think of for the huge lineups is that there aren't very many places to get good ramen in this city.  Gyoza was decent - fresh enough, but not fried crispy enough.  The sauce was the best part of it.  Shoyu ramen: quite good on the first few mouthfuls, but the broth especially started tasting a whole lot like soy sauce, and not as interesting as I'd like the more I ate.  Again, good, but nothing to do somersaults about.  Noodle were good, and chewy.  And if you order pork belly, be sure you like pork fat.  My piece was about a 2:1 ratio of fat to meat.  Service is friendly (WAY better than Kenzo), decor and ambiance are fun.  Is it worth the wait?  Not for me at lunch time, but maybe for a quick dinner."}
{"text":"A replica of the other Kinton Ramen locations downtown.  Good service and quality ramen.  I had a mix up with my order (partially my fault) and decided to pack it up to go in order to avoid any issue and then order another menu item.  They decided to charge me .50 for a \"to go\" box.  I wasn't really happy about that so mentioned it to them before paying and they were nice enough to remove the 50 cents.   Overall a nice place but has a different vibe then the other Kintons."}
{"text":"Food was OK. Service from the wait staff was horrible. I believe our order was not punched until after 20 minutes of it being taken. People that sat beside us was served the same apps we ordered and they sat and order after we ordered.  We ordered 2 ramen soups, spicy pork and miso pork, an order of gyoza and hot karage. For the apps, the gyoza was great and I could say its better than what Kenzo serves(I will be comparing it to Kenzo because its the closest ramen shop...). The hot karage was ok, the chicken cuts where huge, flavour is there. If the karage was bitesize I think it would be more enjoyable to eat. For the ramen, I am sure most people come here for that specific dish, the base for both is flavourful. The meat serving could use a little more. Having the options to add more toppings and changing noodle size is great but I feel like it cost more of the amount you get.  I asked to have both thin and thick noodles but it was not entered in the order despite the fact that the server told me it would be extra and confirmed with me if I am ok with paying extra.  The cook and kitchen staff is visible from the dining area. Having sat at the prep bar, We got to witness how our food was made. It was a good thing to see. Kitchen staff did very well despite the volume of orders.  To sum it all up:  Food 4/5 Service 2/5"}
{"text":"Very tasty ramen and dessert! The chicken ramen is more like a creamy soup, while the pork ramen is the typical soup. The place is a little small and crowded, but for a group of 4-6. In general, five star for the food!"}
{"text":"I went here for dinner with my mom for their grand opening. The wait went by relatively fast however during waiting the staff was quite rude to my mother and rudely told my mom to get back in line as she was looking at the menu on the window, so not the best first impression. The interior did look almost identical to the chains in Toronto.  We ordered the pork miso ramen and the pork spicy garlic ramen. The pork miso broth was flavourful but a bit salty and the egg was slightly overcooked as were the noodles. The pork spicy garlic was not overly spicy and the pork was very tender but with a bit too much fat. Overall both dishes were decent and for half off on grand opening it was a pretty good deal.  However once we were nearing the end of our meal we heard the staff ask everyone around us who had finished eating to take a picture with them for Instagram and I mean EVERYONE. So naturally we were excited that once we finished our meal they would ask us too, but instead the staff rudely handed us the bill without saying a word and rushed us to leave. I found the attitude paired with the waiters behaviour while we were in line gave this place a off-putting atmosphere.  Overall this place is better than Kenzo Ramen and probably the only decent place in Mississauga. It's definitely not as good as Toronto, and if you come here beware the bad service."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and tried both their chicken and beef broth. They give you a good portion of noodles which were cooked to al dente, the seasoned egg was decent, but nothing special.   I like both the miso chicken broth and the original pork broth, delicious and rich with flavour, but they are slightly too salty for me to give them a 4star.   The place was small, but lively with loud music and chanting when guests walk in and out of the restaurant.. Meal prices are also a bit on the high end ($11-$14 for a bowl) and you need to add $1 for additional toppings..   Overall a decent experience, just not sure how I feel about having to pay an additional $0.50 for a doggie bag.. ?"}
{"text":"I went to Kinton with a group of friends, the ambiance of the place is great, I enjoyed the decor, it is very warm and welcoming. The service was good, the waiters/waitresses were very accommodating, and helpful. The food on the other hand wasn't mind blowing, I love ramen, I had ramen in most of restaurants offering it in Montreal. This is place is not bad at all, don't get me wrong, I enjoyed it but they were few things not write like the pork was a bit dry for my taste."}
{"text":"As we were visiting Toronto for the first time, we saw many signs for Ramen. We were super enthusiastic about having traditional ramen so we used Yelp to find a great spot. We chose this one and couldn't have been happier with our choice. The food was great! Our tummy's were dancing with delight and satisfaction. We didn't know what to expect but man was it good. Thank you for making our first Ramen experience all that and more. Most importantly my 10 year old son was in Ramen heaven and that's most important to me!"}
{"text":"Food is ok. Not bad. Waitresses quite friendly. I ordered their special ramen. Totally stuffed. They also provides a points card. I would say nothing special? Oh the side dishes is good. Takoyaki and some kind of fried tofu that's different from the agedashi tofu."}
{"text":"Stopped by with family for a quick dinner before heading out to a show last weekend.   Luckily grabbed the last 4 seats as the friendly staffed called hello to us as we walked in. So fun and friendly that the chefs would call out, welcoming patrons from the kitchen, as well as a kind welcome from the hostess.   I went for the pork broth spicy garlic ramen with thin noodles, pork belly and an egg. The flavour of the broth was nice, and my family was jealous they didn't order the same!  If anything, there was so much fresh garlic I was worried I would reek! The noodles were tender, and the egg fresh. The pork was a little fattier than I like, the meat to fat ratio wasn't exactly even, but it wasn't a big problem.   I also loved being able to watch the chefs do their thing in the open kitchen.   We were in a bit of a rush so we didn't try anything except our ramen bowls, but I look forward to trying this location again and other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Disappointed experience. Noodles were undercooked and chewy. I'm not a big eater but portions are small, still hungry afterwards. I work nearby and there are plenty of places to eat for less than $11."}
{"text":"I think we're a little spoiled for choice in Toronto with all of the ramen options out there, but this is the only place where I'd brave -20 degrees (with windchill) weather to consume a warm boil of spicy pork ramen.  The place was packed when we arrived at a little past 6pm, but we were seated in front of the kitchen with no issues. The space is quite small, but if you actually want to see your food then front of kitchen is better than front of bar. Jackets are left out front on a public rack, but if your concerned with someone making off with your Canada Goose then you're SOL and have to wear it/sit on it.  I love the spicy garlic soup base - it's the right amount of spice and kills off vampires with the shaved garlic on top. Don't eat this on a first date, but maybe when you've been dating the same person for a year and you've already moved past the whole \"damn girl, you're kinda nasty but I dig it\" stage. I like the pork shoulder a lot more than the pork belly because I don't like fatty meats, but you also have a choice of chicken if you want a lighter offering. Kinton will allow you to customize your soup base, meat of choice, and various add ons. I love, love the seasoned egg so for +$1.50 just do it. But -1 star for making me pay $1.50 for an egg and go against all of my Asian sensibilities."}
{"text":"Very authentic yet modern Japanese ramen. Place is trendy, yet a bit small and somewhat crammed, especially at the back (I guess that's what gives it the Japanese feel). The kitchen is kind of opened; you can see the cooks making the food but at the same time it makes the restaurant very, very warm and stuffy - might be a good idea to wear a tee shirt even if it's winter; if you're sitting near the door it might be a bit cooler.   Staff is upbeat, but kind of made me feel rushed to order and eat, which I really don't like when eating, thus minus one star for them.  The broths here are really rich, a little too salty for me actually. Tried the cheese ramen and there was a generous amount of grated (mozzarella I think) cheese on the ramen, very fluffy and light; interesting pairing with the ramen in soup. A bit too warm to finish the entire bowl so no, I am not a Kinton Bowler :p Their karaage is pretty good; original, not the spicy one. Outside is crispy and has good spices, inside is juicy and tender, goes nicely with the ponzu sauce they provided. Good dish at this restaurant - give it a try.  Nice place to meet up for a quick meal with friends or just by yourself. Expect this place to be busy and loud, especially at night."}
{"text":"This place has a nice trendy vibe to it. I was seated at the bar where you can watch the cooks make the food.  The service is phenomenal. Everyone is really friendly and eager to get your order done correctly. Every time someone enters or leaves, the entire staff will yell something in Japanese!  We ordered one Kinton combo (chicken ramen spicy jalapeño with thin noodles and the Ton Ton Don) and one pork ramen spicy garlic with thick noodles. Both were good, but I enjoyed the chicken soup more. It was less oily than the pork and the spicy garlic was spicier than the jalapeño! I couldn't even drink the soup because the flavour was too spicy. The thick noodles were also harder than the thin ones."}
{"text":"OG Kinton Ramen. Can't go wrong! Noodle to soup ratio is amazing. I ordered the chicken Kinton ramen Combo with gyoza appetizer. Amazing! Gyoza was crisp to a perfection drizzled with sauce on top. The ramen was great. Soup base was a creamy-ish consistency. Chicken breast slices were nice and soft and melted with every bite. Totally would come back over and over again for ramen cravings. I highly recommend coming here for ramen!"}
{"text":"Kinton Ramen!   Always a great go-to ramen place. Better than the rest that I know.   I usually order the chicken ramen. They recently changed their chicken broth to a more rich and hearty, thicker broth. I like the change but not too sure if others will (if you don't like a thicker broth). Their noodles are freshly made, and broth right before you. Noodle/soup ratio is perfect. Always have a egg as well! So good and worth it!   If you like appetizers, I highly recommend their karange (Japanese fried chicken). Just get it. You won't regret! Also their Gyoza is amazing. I usually get it with the ramen special.   The environment makes you feel like you're in Japan! They chant and shout when you leave and enter. It's cute :)  Overall- come here if you're looking for ramen. Tastes amazing. Nothing is watered down. Great service, food and environment. Very flavourful and you won't regret it! 4/5!"}
{"text":"Not sure how to correct the yelp company info but they close at 10:30pm on sat!!! not  2am  I think this place at least deserves a 4. I didn't have to wait though as we went during last call before they closed so maybe that is a different story.  Overall the noodles were very good. Normal (regular) Shio soup had good taste, similar to mitsuwa from San Deigo for all you people from Cali. The pork shoulder was really good too. Finally the egg was interesting, not sure how they cooked it but it was gooey on the inside and fully cooked on the outside. The portions were huge though, definitely didn't expect that big of a bowl or maybe I wasn't that hungry at 10:00pm at night.   I've heard people wait for 2 hours during the day but I would definitely not wait 2 hours for this. I don't think I would wait for much for 2 hours not even the 5 star yelp review places i posted.  One of the best Ramen places you can find in Toronto I think. I not give kenzo a try."}
{"text":"SO happy that Kinton finally opened up in Scarborough! Five years ago I wouldn't have even dreamed of this. Now, I can get Kinton almost anytime since it's 5min away from home. It opened a week ago and I've been back twice so far.   Original Pork ramen was excellent. The egg was not warm but the flavourful soup broth and perfectly al dente thick noodles made up for it. We also ordered Karaage - it was perfectly fried however lacking flavour. Also, noticed that the Karaage portion is smaller compared to the Richmond Hill location...then realized there is a massive price difference. Seems like each location has its own menus and pricing although the ramen seems to be all consistent.   Comments for management: Because it just opened a week ago, service is a bit slow. We asked for hot water which never arrived and had to ask for cold water at some point during our meal. Also, please improve the seating priorities by planning ahead when there are groups of 4 waiting vs groups of 2."}
{"text":"Oh ramen, you can do no wrong.  Checked out Kinton with a friend on a Friday night for some post-work comfort food after a rough day.    Ordered the shoyu ramen with pork and thin noodles ($10) and a pint of Sapporo ($6).  Plenty of noodles here and good portion of pork as well.  I was stuffed about half way through so I passed on the seasoned egg.  Broth was flavourful and not overly salty.  Delicious...like a warm hug from Grandma.  I felt better about my craptastic day.  Love the decor inside Kinton.  Staff were friendly and lively.  Definitely would come back for noodles next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Been here many times and every time the food has been amazing, especially the miso based ramen (with lean pork) and the gyoza dumplings with a sauce that is to die for  The menu is quite straight forward and relatively affordable, around $13 for a ramen bowl, which is pretty standard around Toronto. The service is super fast and multiple staff may even assist you, in case it gets busy. The atmosphere is also sweet"}
{"text":"Definitely not the best ramen in Toronto, but it's a solid OK rating.  The ramen is a large portion size: i got the extra pork one that had 3 large pieces of pork in it.  It was kind of dry, but not horrible.  The broth was good, but i didn't feel bad not finishing.  It's nice to be able to watch them make it.  Overall it's a good place to check out if you like ramen and want to try different options."}
{"text":"The place is a little loud (with all the screaming in Japanese and electronica) but refreshing.  The food was reasonably priced, tasty and seemingly healthy.  This is NOT a Chinese greasy spoon.  Try the chicken breast with thick noodles.  It was awesome!"}
{"text":"AMAZING RAMEN. I got the spicy pork ramen, without the pork and my boyfriend got the miso pork ramen and both were absolutely delicious. Fairly priced and great atmosphere."}
{"text":"I had heard of Kinton ramen, so when I heard the first one opened in Montreal, I was pretty excited to try it.   We got the Age Gyoza which is always a good starter before ramen, made with four pieces of fried pork dumplings with sweet chili sauce. I normally don't like mayo sauce, but they only put a little bit so it was a nice compliment to the dish.   I had the spicy pork ramen for my main dish, and the noodles were excellent; perfectly cooked, and thick just as I love them. The pork was so tender, it melted in your mouth, and the soup - rich, and spicy, but not too much, just the right amount of a kick. My sister had the Shoyu pork ramen and it was way too salty. It seems they poured too much soy sauce in it. I will not take that one in the future, for sure.   The place is new so it's clean and the service was friendly."}
{"text":"Kinton Ramen was one of the first to get into the Toronto Ramen scene. It is actually where my husband and I had our first date.   The food is very consistent. The vibe is very upbeat and friendly. However, over the years, service has declined a bit. They do not have enough hands during busy peaks but it is less crowded because they have expanded to five stores.   The Tofu Nuggets are the best! My favourite ramen is the chicken jalapeño. It is lighter than the pork ramen. I am not a fan of the pork soup base but my husband prefers pork.   A nice spot to eat lunch or dinner in Baldwin Village/AGO area."}
{"text":"I really wish there was Kinton Ramen closer to where I live because this is a really great place for ramen! I love that Kinton offers customization for their ramen because I ALWAYS order their thick noodles. Personal preference really, I love udon so of course I'd opt for the thick noodles if I get the chance haha.   I ordered the Spicy Garlic Pork Ramen - I really enjoyed this meal and thinking about it now already makes me want to go back to get some more. I think its a bit to much garlic though, I mixed the entire portion garlic provided and it overpowered the flavours of the broth, noodles and pork. However this is a easy fix as they serve this meal with a ball of garlic so I often just mix half of it and give the rest to my boyfriend or leave it aside.   I ordered the ramen in a meal combo, so I was able to order some gyoza as well! DELICIOUS! That is all I have to say. I went with my friend one time and she ordered the Karage and oh man ....It was a dream come true LOL. The food is just way too good here!   It's a very small place so it really packed whenever I come but man for some good ramen, I'll wait! Service was also good :) Nothing too outstanding but it was good enough to make all my visits there a wonderful experience. Will be back and definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Came here on a (relatively) late Sunday night and was glad I did not have to wait for a table nor wait for my ramen to come out (unlike what most of the other reviews have complained about). When my friend and I first walked in, none of the servers spotted us but one kitchen staff did; he looked a tad confused and we stood there for an awkward amount of time before someone seated us (but without the whole loud Japanese 'welcome' :'( ).   I decided to order the Spicy Pork Ramen since I did not enjoy the shoyu or miso ramen from the Baldwin location. And I must say, I was not disappointed; the soup base was the right amount of spicy, I liked that they used real minced garlic (bringing the flavour up a notch), and their pork belly is VERY VERY good (so very savoury). However, the thick noodle that I got was undercooked (and I like noodles that are \"al dente\"....but this was plain hard). Like most reviewers though, I will also give this location the benefit of the doubt since they are \"new\" (well...they've been open a few months now) and hope that they improve their noodle cooking soon.   I still feel that Kinton lacks the complex, layered flavours in their soup bases when compared to other ramen restaurants and so it's hard to give them more than 3/5. At the end, the staff gave us a warm, smiley, and loud \"thank you/see you soon\" which makes me think Kinton is a nice addition to the Markham scene."}
{"text":"My friends and family consider Kinton as their go-to place for Ramen. I decided to give this location another chance. My first time here was a couple years ago where I ordered the shoyu Ramen but found the soup to be way. Too. Salty. Almost impossible to even sip. (That meal I would give a 2/5).   This time, from the recommendation of my sister, I got the Miso Ramen. This was the complete opposite of the shoyu soup I had because I found this soup to be too bland. It just didn't wow me! And although I could have finished the bowl at the end of the meal, I chose not to because I didn't find the soup that great. It was, however, an improvement from the Shoyu Ramen.   The thick noodles were quite good, but the toppings that come with all the ramen were lacking. I did find their pork to be very tender and juicy though.   My friends ordered the original Ramen which comes with an egg (whereas the miso did not) and they both said they enjoyed their ramen and soup.   Overall, kinton feels very average to me, and since it's in proximity to where I usually \"chill\", I most likely will come back....if I'm desperate.   Perhaps next time I'll try the spicy garlic ramen--I'm sure that one might be more flavourful. But for now, I have yet to find something \"special\" about kinton."}
{"text":"My friend took me here. Their portions are super filling so do not come here if you already ate! The place has a very nice atmosphere and the servers are very nice! The place is super clean and the prices are not bad!   You must try their TAKOYAKI balls, they are amazzzzzzzzing. They are sooooo goood and worth coming back for! Their ramen is pretty delicious too!"}
{"text":"The ramen here is very good: meat is melt-in-your-mouth tender, thin noodles cooked with a tiny bit of hardness, the broth rich and flavorful. I had the miso ramen, with added toppings of egg and wakame. It's a good lunch spot, and even at peak hours it's easier to get a seat than at Sansotei, for example. I like the decor, with textured wood along the walls and little golden piggies everywhere (\"kin+ton\"). The layout, though, with a long corridor, makes for bad acoustics and hampers attentive service. Service is very much hit or miss: sometimes good, but often slow and neglectful. When it's busy, the place gets very loud, making it impossible to talk; music is way too loud at all times. On the plus side, there are some good vegetarian options, including soup, which my partner tells me is tasty and satisfying."}
{"text":"First time I've been to a ramen place, it was really crowed so I thought it'd be great. The wait was long and when we finally got seated, it was very small and didn't have much room to sit. Food was okay, was expecting it to taste a lot better. Probably won't go back again"}
{"text":"Sapporo pint for $3 or pitcher for $10 from Monday to Thursday. Ramen and all the accompanying ingredients were yummy and portion size was about right. The music was at a moderate level, didn't need to shout across the table and repeat myself a billion times with a friend. This location is much better than the one at Spadina & Queen imo."}
{"text":"If you're craving ramen, Kinton is a solid option in the Bloor/Christie neighbourhood. They offer both pork and chicken varieties with 4 different types of broth, 3 levels of flavour richness and 2 types of noodles. My personal favourite is the Miso Pork Ramen with thick noodles. I also tried Spicy Garlic Pork Ramen, but it was too spicy for my taste. The broth wasn't as tasty as the Miso Pork Ramen. Don't be freaked out by the unanimous greeting in Japanese of all the chefs in the kitchen and staff on the floor all at once...when you enter AND when you leave. It's a tradition at all of their locations as it appears. The only gripe I have with that place is that their wooden stools have zero padding, making them relatively uncomfortable to sit on. Otherwise, it's an awesome place to have a bowl of ramen, especially when it's cold outside."}
{"text":"Super salty broth. I waited an hour to be seated standing in the cold being told that i was going to be seated within the next 20-35 minutes or so.. which didn't happen. i've read, and heard so many great things about kinton, but now that i finally tried it ... i'm not sure if i want to again. Everything was salty, i did get regular soup broth.. so in the future if i do end up coming back, i'll probably get my soup as (light). the pork belly is alright, better than other places. the deep fried dumplings (gyoza) is good.. it has a slightly different taste than other restaurants. I was pretty much only disappointed with the ramen and the long wait .. but what can i say.. expectations lead to disappointments."}
{"text":"It is a good ramen restaurant, quite similar to the  ones in Japan..  Decoration is cosy and service people are friendly.."}
{"text":"Not as good as Yokato Yokabai, but better than Misoya and Ichifuku, much better than Nakamichi which is terrible.  Overall it's OK. The seasoned eggs are excellent, but the pork was hard and too old, the broth was not flavorful. Nice decor.  If ANYONE thinks this is great ramen, they need to take the Greyhound bus to New York City."}
{"text":"Definitely not suggested! Price goes up, but they put less noodle compared to before, I only had 4 bites and only soup left.  The soup is too salty now."}
{"text":"*Ctrl+F \"salt\". Yup, looks like I'm not the only one to think so.  Kinton is an authentic, well established, and truly fun restaurant. There is usually a lineup at the entrance, and all leaving and entering are greeted warmly by the kind staff!   The solid contents of the ramen, from the noodles, to the golden eggs, and meat are all delicious. My only issue is with the broth. I'm not a ramen aficionado, but apparently 'rich broth' translates to a few table spoons of salt. Perhaps this is the way the dish was meant to be enjoyed, but I must admit my palate is too weak for the luxurious serving of salt.   Overall, I enjoyed the atmosphere but could not finish my ramen."}
{"text":"I was excited to go to this place because I've been hearing good things about it! The restaurant has a really cool atmosphere and the staff are really nice. Although, I feel like the menu is a bit small. Other than ramen, there's not much food and dessert.. Basically you can customize your own ramen. The first step is to chose between chicken or pork, then you chose if you want your soup normal/shoyu/miso/spicy, you get to chose if you want either thick or thin noodles, and then you can topping like egg or slice of cheese (but they're not free, ranging from 1 to 4$!) I had the chicken shoyu ramen with thin noodles, it was pretty salty so I was a bit disappointed. My boyfriend had the pork miso ramen with thin noodles and it was so delicious! Overall, I was still satisfied and I will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Very good Ramen, LOTS of variations to choose from. Tiny place, really busy, but excellent service. Reminded me a bit of the small cramped , specialty joints in Japan. A little showmanship, pride in what they do and good food. Ill certainly be back...."}
{"text":"4.7  this place remains my favorite ramen place for now. I always leave full, gyozas are so good, lemonade is a hit, shoulder pork is really well broiled, staff is efficient and I like to seat at the noodle bar and watch how they prepare the ramen etc"}
{"text":"The time management of this restaurant is very questionable and needs tremendous improvements to convince me to return to this location. My family and I ordered 3 ramen bowls and an appetizer. It took at least 30 minutes for all the food to finally come which is a little ridiculous as the restaurant was not even full during this time. I can see at least 6 chefs working behind the counter and at least 2 of them looked like they had no idea what they were doing. They also forgot one of our orders (not the waiter's fault).   Food wise..the soup was very bland and the noodles and egg were overcooked into a mush and I found a fully wooden spoon to be a little unsanitary.  I found the wooden stools very uncomfortable to sit for long periods of time. If they're plan is to rush people to eat faster it's contradicting their extremely slow service. Looking around the room, there were many tables waiting for their food despite 6 chefs \"working\".   I will not be returning to this location until improvements to their service can be made."}
{"text":"The eglinton KINTON ramen is definitely the best KINTON ramen chain we've had. The broth was balanced, and the noodles were nice and chewy. The only qualm was the ramen egg was a bit over cooked.   Overall, it's our favorite location for a bowl of KINTON ramen!"}
{"text":"I found this place to be only decent mainly because I'm not a big fan of wheat noodles (the noodles in ramen). The texture of the noodle itself is something I don't particularly like. It is firm to the bite, hard but soft enough. But comparing to other ramen places, I'd say I actually enjoyed my bowl of ramen. I ordered the regular miso pork broth with pork belly and thick noodles. The broth was deliciously made - rich in flavor and so warm! I really like how the ramen was not swimming in oil like many other places. My only complaint is that the pork belly was too big to bite. Instead of one huge pork belly I think it would've tasted better if there were several smaller slices. Oh oh and if the pork belly was slightly fattier...mmm.  The combo (which was only $2 more!) came with Ton Ton Don (chopped pork seasoned with kinton original sauce on rice). At first you'd think \"uhh..what the heck is this? I paid $2 for a tiny bowl of rice with meat only enough to cover the hole between my teeth? I swear I saw other Yelpers getting Takoyaki!\". Boy was I wrong. I took a bite and BAM! All the flavour just exploded in my mouth. MMmm! What is this?! What sauce is this.. how on earth did they make a plain dish like chopped pork and rice so good? Even the pork was delicious!  Though the portion was decent, it wasn't worth $10.90 for a bowl of noodle. I'm just Chinese like that. And because I'm Chinese like that, I can easily find noodles that are cheaper, equally or more delicious, and bigger in portion under $10. Why is a bowl of ramen so expensive anyway?"}
{"text":"A bowl of ramen is good comfort food. It's always easy to eat and satisfying.  My lunch partner and I decided on Kinton because it is part of the Kinka family. I had the original with thin noodles and no other extras, but I couldn't pass up the opportunity to eat a Kaarage (fried chicken) because it is my favourite dish at Kinka.  Much like Kinka, the ambiance and the decor are really nice. It's an enjoyable place for a bite.  The original ramen was OK - good, even, but not super exciting either. I thought it was a bit boring. For me, a good ramen needs to have a little \"kick\" of something. The original had none.  The kaarage however is always delicious :-)  I'd go back, but I'll try something else next time. Either the spicy, the shoyu or the miso, but my companion who had been before said that the shoyu was heavy on the salt. I'll have to find out for myself.  To conclude: I've had better basic ramen in Montreal, but this one is all right. With a side of Kaarage, its a neat little lunch.  Oh one thing I did want to mention: the menu makes it seem like the side dish (ton ton don or chiki chiki don) is included, but it's not. It's extra. I would not have had it if I had known. It was ok but nothing special."}
{"text":"I love Kinton Ramen.  We got the basic pork ramen at under $11. It was deelish. The broth was super rich. The noodles were very fresh and tasty. The pork meat was very nice. The egg was beautifully cooked and sweet on the inside.  My two small complaints is that you don't get all the accoutrements that often come with ramen and that the pork was not as tender as pork belly which you often get. Still, very tasty ramen.  To top it all, they have $10 pitchers of Sapporo Sunday to Thursday.  The ambiance is nice.  This Kinton is located in trendy Baldwin."}
{"text":"The Kinton at this location dishes out (or should I say... bowls out) great tasting ramen. I've been to this specific Kinton a couple times now and they've cooked consistently well every time.  I felt a little adventurous today and chose the spicy garlic pork ramen, as opposed to my normal order of the pork shoyu. I didn't know what to expect of Japanese spice as I often don't associate spicy food with Japan.  Kinton uses chili powder as the spice of choice. It's not spicy at first but it does build up over time. Nothing overwhelming, but that's if you're good at handling the heat. Some ramen shops opt for chili oil, but I prefer the chili powder because it's less greasy and leaves less of a film in my mouth.  I come to Kinton specifically for the egg though. Very few places can cook a soft boiled egg well. The exterior is nice and brown, and crack it open to reveal a luscious, ooey-gooey yolk center. I could eat that forever...   /drool  Be warned, you may experience long wait times, whether that's getting a table or your food. The restaurant is decently sized (a bit bigger than their other locations) but still can't hold the demand.  That being said though, the staff are really polite and welcoming - but if you're in a rush, I recommend going somewhere else.   3.5/5"}
{"text":"The ramen is super average here and this joint does not offer anything that's worth while in particular. I was really not impressed with the broth. The noodles were chewy but I would not come back for ramen here seeing that there are better choices out in the city."}
{"text":"So after having this place hyped-up to me for the last year, I finally had a chance to try it out. As expected, there was a somewhat long wait-time for a Friday night - 20 minutes for a table of two.   ATMOSPHERE:  As it looks from the outside, this place is cramped and busy - definitely not ideal (or possible) for a larger group. I'm not a fan of places that are too smoky on the inside, and this place definitely was (humid too). However this place was fairly lively, what with their Guu-like salutations and talkative patrons.   Our table was sticky, which I'm guessing happened b/c of the quick turnover to meet the demands of the long lines. The wooden chairs were quite uncomfortable, but I understand they're used to conserve space, rather than provide comfort.  SERVICE:  Service was slow, again due to the place consistently being packed, but the servers were friendly - they take the time to break down menu options, and do check in pretty regularly throughout the meal.  FOOD:  I can see why many enjoy this place, as it offers more options than the standard Ramen joints. In addition to the typical options to add extra \"meat\" (you can actually specify what kind of meat here, unlike some other places), you can actually choose between noodle types, and soup base. They also offer a few small plates, including the option to combo a dish with a ramen meal. The tea came in jars, which was a unique touch.  I will say that the noodles at Kinton, really set this place apart - they were silky smooth, and just felt (and tasted) higher quality than most Ramen places. The pork shoulder I ordered seemed a bit on the tough side. After going with the \"Spicy Garlic Pork,\" I realized they were not kidding around with their garlic - this thing was DROWNING in it. Luckily, I love garlic, so all was well. The spiciness level also met my expectation, as I needed to stop and wipe my brown many a times.   VERDICT:  3.5. This might have been a \"4,\" but my expectations were blown through the roof even before coming. Also, while the food was satisfying, I'm not a fan of the interior. I will probably be back."}
{"text":"First time trying Kinton after a long ramen withdrawal. The menu has several steps to build your own ramen. I decided to go with the original pork shoulder ramen in a light broth. The meat was a bit dry but the noodles were good and the broth was indeed light, a bit too light on the umami. Egg was cooked perfectly with that gooey runny yolk. Also ordered some appetizers. The spicy karage had a nice kick to it. Meat was juicy with a nice crispy exterior. The dumplings were decent. We were seated right in front of the open kitchen so we watched the whole ramen making process as we ate. Nice friendly atmosphere and the washrooms are really clean and elegant. Would come back and get the pork belly next time."}
{"text":"It helps that the lacklustre reviews I have read ahead of time on Yelp and heard from my friends made my expectations pretty low therefore I was pleasantly surprised.  - Wait: Yes, we did wait for over an hour outside in the heat. We went to go get bbtea from tenren (but kinton wont let you consume outside drinks inside) and waited on the bench. - Restaurant: it's a Ramen BAR, not a restaurant. Open Kitchen concept is nice, but we were seated by the drinks bar rather than the kitchen bar. -Gyoza: the dumplings were $4 and came in four. They were DELICIOUS! I dont regret getting them at all.  - Spicy Garlic Ramen in rich broth with pork shoulder: The soup base was fantastic (rich but not heavy). A giant wad of minced garlic is placed on the top that you can stir in. If you don't want the garlic, tell them to hold it or simply pick it out. The noodles were fantastically del dente. The shoulder, however, was subpar. Too dry and chewy. The belly is the better choice. You can also choose light or reg soup base too. - Price and value: $10 for a giant bowl of ramen you can barely finish is not bad at all.  Is it worth the wait though? I don't think so. The food is fantastic, but ,unlike guu, i will not wait for an hour for it ever again."}
{"text":"I've been to this location a few times, usually for lunch. Surprisingly not a lot of people at around 1230pm on a weekday. The menu is simple and have pictures of the food item, which makes it easier to order and know what to expect from your order. The atmosphere is really big with lots of seatings, even bar top too! But the little wooden chairs are not the most comfortable thing, yet it is convenient where you can put your stuff underneath it.  This time, I ordered the combo ($14.99) with the choice of PORK MISO ramen pairing with THIN noodles, CHIKI CHIKI DON (chicken rice), and an extra seasoned egg.  RAMEN- the broth wasn't salty but still rich in flavour, perfect pair with the THIN noodles. The pork slices were thick yet chewy... and they were a bit cold. That extra seasoned egg was cooked perfectly, recommend to eat it right away (I waited and it was more cooked than I liked).  CHIKI CHIKI DON- it was a cute little bowl of chicken rice. The rice to meat ratio was good, but this time the rice was a bit on the harder side."}
{"text":"Kinton has been the original standard which I compare other places so I was super happy they opened one in Markham. Based on the other reviews, I was wary since I love the one on Baldwin. We ordered the Dec special and the veggie ramen  - just as expected - it definitely hit the spot. Nice chewy noodles with a rich broth. Toppings were generous while pork shoulder and belly had good flavour. With all the shops popping up, competition is tough. We actually going their appetizer menu was quite good: calamari, Kinton ball, tuna sashimi and octopus salad.   This location is nice as it's larger so hopefully with more time their service will get faster (we didn't have any issues with it before). Can't wait to hold back!!!"}
{"text":"I have been Kinton twice and loved it everytime. So I have tried the following:  Cheese Ramen with Pork Shoulder and Regular Soup This is a surprisingly good combination as when I first read the menu I couldn't believe they put cheese in ramen but somehow it works. The cheese is a nice gooey finish on it. Pork shoulder and soup was good as well.  Shio Ramen with Pork Shoulder and Rich Soup Very flavourful soup but it is much more rich so not quite good for the calorie counters. Pork shoulder and beansprouts were also a good combo.  Between reg and rich, I like the rich soup as I find the flavour fuller. I haven't tried the pork belly yet so that will be next on my list.  The only downside is that the place is not great with big groups as they have bench tables and one 1 area in the back for groups. Ideally better for 2 - 4 at most."}
{"text":"The doors are really heavy to open. Like actually ????  The ramen quality was good with the meat being better than most other ramen places including hokkaido. The soup was bland.  A decent place to get food, nothing special but not terrible."}
{"text":"My favourite ramen restaurant in downtown Montreal. For a ramen to be prefect, it require 3 elements : noodles, soups and meats.  + Their Noodles are AMAZING, chewy and bouncy. You have 2 choice THICK or THIN noodles. I usually go with thin noodle because like my noodle chewy. You get a lot of noodle for the size. Although my friend always other extra noodle, but I personally think the proportion is good. And special secret noodle, is the KALE  noodle. They only serve it with Salad noodle (I think). I never tried it, but my friend love it. (It is a veggie option) +Their soup are perfectly seasoned, not too salty. You also have 2 choice Chicken/ Pork soup. Chicken soup have less favour than Pork. I believe it much be healthier. But the Pork soup is strong and flavourful.I usually go for Pork soup with Spicy. Because the spicy chicken soup can't keep up with the pork.  +The meat is also perfectly cooked. It is soft and full of flavour. The meat will just melt in your mouth. Plus, the cut is less fatty than other places. It balance well with the soup and noodles.   SPECIAL, love their special menu. It changes according to season. I tried their cold noodle during summer and still craving for it now ( after 5months). They don't have much too choose from, but their special menu is a plus.  Like most other asian restaurant, they don't have much desserts. But their black sesame putting is DELICIOUS. Love it.   A small cons, is that their entrees are small and too pricy (-1*) but their bathrooms are cray cute, clean and creative (+1*). So it make up for it."}
{"text":"Ramen - slurp that shhhh like the Japanese do and get the f out.  No seriously - leave.  Don't be that stupid GAIJIN that posts up while nursing your Sapporo. You ate, you enjoyed, now go. There's people waiting outside dumbass."}
{"text":"Go here if you wanna avoid the lineups at Baldwin. Spicy Karaage + Ramen = game over. Decor is A+"}
{"text":"Amazing staff work here. They make the atmosphere so lively and comfortable. Perfect place to have a nice warm meal with a date or with friends.   The ramen has a choice of chicken or pork broth. A selection of toppings and spiciness. Extra for more toppings and great appetizers. I recommend the karrage ( 4 large pieces) or the gyoza. I personally prefer the chicken broth over the pork broth here. Broth isn't too salty, chicken is either flavorful or meh at times. This time I had their special with Fish broth. it came with pork belly. Would have preferred the two seared pork belly cuts than multiple small pork belly cuts that were cook in the broth. The ramen had a nice topping of cold radish that refreshed my palette.   On our visit to this location they ask to take our photo for their IG. Caught me off guard but was flatter to take it.   They have a promotion where you collect stamps for prizes which is one way to get me back. I'm a sucker for these"}
{"text":"Delicious ramen, chika chika and chicken karage. Tried cheese on ramen and it was delicious. On the expensive side."}
{"text":"This is my second time going to Kinton at this venue and it was mediocre. There are so many options in the vicinity that it makes for stiff competition and there is at least one other ramen joint I would choose over this Kinton.  We came in for lunch on a weekday and we didn't need to wait. The decor and atmosphere is good as it gives a slightly new/contemporary interior. The wall is typical of all Kinton ramen places with their cool looking wood walls. Service was good.  I ordered the Miso pork belly ramen with the chicken and mayo side dish combo which came to $12.90 before tax. There was NO LUNCH MENU which was a huge disappointment because typically lunches are cheaper in order to draw more consumers. This is why I needed to reduce their rating since I expect some kind of special for lunches.  The broth I chose was thick miso however it was not as thick as it should have been. I expected a rich creamy broth but it seemed average. The pork belly was thin and could've been juicer. The noodles were good and elastic. Quantity was sufficient.  The side dish of chicken and mayo on rice was sub-par as it was small and flavorless save for the little bit of mayo. Nothing special and I would highly suggest to AVOID IT because of its price.  Overall, the price is not worth this ramen joint. You're paying $15-20 after tax for a bowl of ramen and at the end of the day, it is too much for noodles and meat of this quality. Look around because Church/Gerrard is home to many other better ramen joints."}
{"text":"Fun place to have ramen. They are very welcoming (more than other Japanese places I've been to).  The ramen is typical of Japanese ramen store, not particularly brilliant but it's good!   They also have reward program and will snap a picture with you (with your permission of course).   Fun lil Japanese ramen store."}
{"text":"All I can say is... this location doesn't have the combo set.  You're shop is located in a heavy Asian demographic... who likes lots of food for s good price and not other way around.  I won't be coming back until the combo is back.  Update: combo good until 5pm... why is it so hard to have uniformity and offer it all day just like every other location????"}
{"text":"Definitely over hyped. It was delicious but the broth was a bit too oily for my liking. The pork belly melts in your mouth but one slice wasn't enough and extra was needed."}
{"text":"Tried out this new location today for lunch. I ordered the Spicy Jalapeño Extra Chicken ramen and my brother had the Extra Pork Shoyu ramen. Both soup bases were weak and not as good as their downtown locations. They also play their music playing too loud. They should know it's a problem when their waiters can't even hear their customer's order."}
{"text":"I have to say that this Kinton location is the least favourite of all the locations.  Loving the Baldwin joint from when it originally opened, I was thrilled to hear that one was opening up down the street from me.   I have given this location three tries, and sadly, each time just got worse than the one before it.  The soup tastes very mass produced and drowned in salt. The noodles are a hit or miss, and the pork is always fatty and tough. I have tried three different soup combinations over my visits there and all seem to fall short.  It's not bad when you want a quick bite, but because it is usually so busy, you would be better off heading to pho or ajisen or owl down the road and getting a better quality bowl of soup for the same price.   Would I return? - Not by choice Parking? - Street parking and a Green P behind the restaurant Value for $? - Pretty good Space? - Small inside/limited waiting area Ventilation? - Poor (aka you will stink after) Service? - Average"}
{"text":"The broth is the heart and soul of the bowl. It is rich and flavourful. The noodles are chewy and fresh. Different dishes come with unique ramen and broth combos. My chicken breast ramen had a thick yolky broth with soft noodles. It was one of the best takes on the classic chicken noodle soup I've ever had. I can see why some were displeased with how rich and salty the food is. I, on the other hand, think it makes it the perfect comfort food. Do not be put off by the large crowd and snug communal sitting. The food is so good, you'll be glad to join the slurp splash works and engage in footsie with your ramen comrades."}
{"text":"I got the regular chicken ramen. Really good ramen and really cool place. The seating arrangement is not really suitable for large groups because the venue is really small. There are a couple of tables and seats at the bar so you'll most likely sit beside strangers if u don't sit at the bar but overall nice experience."}
{"text":"Expected better food and quicker service. The meat had no flavor and the chairs were uncomfortable. Didn't expect to wait 35 minutes for ramen after we already waited to give our order."}
{"text":"Great spot for ramen. The $4 beer with an order of ramen deal is a steal, and the noodles themselves are of superb quality. You can't really go wrong here. Atmosphere is trendy and comfortable, although service can be a bit slow sometimes."}
{"text":"Menu wise, it's pretty much the same as all the other locations with ramen being their focus.  We ordered their original ramen with pork with thin noodle (which is the equivalent of what other ramen shops call shio ramen), original ramen with pork with extra thick noodle, and original karaage.  The broth was as good as I remember, thick and velvety, i'm salivating as i'm thinking of it.  The broth is thick enough so it thinly coats your tongue.  No chunks of unappealing fat floating around which is a thumbs up from me.  Both the thin and thick noodle was cooked to a perfect al dente.  Egg was good but I think a slight tad overcooked.  There was the beginning formation of the powdery yolk on the outer edge.  Pork wise, I'm not sure if this is the way the pork is served with ramen at the other locations, but instead of getting a choice of pork shoulder or pork belly, you get one slice of each.  Taste of the pork shoulder was same as the other locations, but thinner.  The pork belly was what was different for me.  The slice of pork belly was smaller, and thinner than the Baldwin location, and the charring of the pork belly was minimal, so there was less of the smokey flavour.  Overall, still better than other ramen shops. The karaage was good, 5 pieces of deep fried thigh meat served piping hot.  So hot that I burned the roof of my mouth, I couldn't help it, I was too excited!  My husband thought that the batter/coating could be a bit thicker to make it crunchier, which I agree.  But it was still crispy enough."}
{"text":"I'm usually not a fan of Kinton Ramen because it's just a bit too salty and heavy for me, but either this location makes a better ramen or I'm getting used to the taste. Either way, I was a fan of this location - the food and service was great. I just wish the eggs came halved rather than whole."}
{"text":"So I dedicated some serious time earlier this year to sussing out Toronto's best ramen places, and while Kinton Ramen didn't take top honors, it was pretty freaking close.  It's as good as people would have you believe; noodles are cooked perfectly; broth is rich, fatty, and delicious; and even the sides are really nice.  The pork's good, offered as both shoulder or belly.  The service is perfunctory, and watching the kitchen team slave away with blowtorches is a good time.  If it wasn't for Santouka Ramen, this would be my number one pick for Ramen in Toronto.  I just feel Santouka balances the fat level of their broth a little bit better with the flavors their managing, and offers slightly superior noodles.  But honestly, it's going to come down to a matter of personal preference when the food's at this level.  Word to the wise?  If you order the Spicy Garlic Ramen, that golf ball of grated white probably-daikon-radish sitting on top of your soup is NOT daikon!  That's the garlic, and there's enough of it to choke a donkey.  You don't need all of it; start by mixing half of it into your soup and go from there.  I made the mistake once of just hucking the whole thing into my soup and mixing it all about, and I emerged from the restaurant scant minutes later equipped to slay vampires by the dozen just by breathing on them.  I could taste garlic well into the next morning.  People gave me awkward glances, and animals ran away whimpering.    Holy hell is it ever so much garlic.  But yeah.  Excellent ramen.  Just don't wimp out and order your broth light.  You want it to be fatty and creamy, or you don't want to be here.  The number of less-than-stellar reviews from people who ordered light-on-flavor broth and then complained about it being light on flavor is just... like, man.  Those people can eat the whole ball of garlic for all I care."}
{"text":"Tried the spicy garlic pork ramen in a combo with the dumplings.  The ramen broth is really nice, it's at the right amount of spice. Dumplings are dipped with special mayo sauce. However, it's a little bit too salty after the meal. Recommend providing a jar of water for each table."}
{"text":"Kinton definitely impressed me and my party of four. We all ordered the original pork ramen, and were very happy with the rich pork flavour of the soup. The only reason why this rating is not 5 stars is because we waited quite a while for our ramen. Other stores like Hokkaido Ramen Santouka and Sansotei are quicker in their delivery. However, Kinton definitely made up for the wait time with one of the best broths I have had in Toronto thus far. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"I have had the same interesting experience at multiple Kinton locations. I usually get the chicken broth because most ramen places usually have just pork based broths. At Kinton the chicken broth comes with chicken by default, but I prefer the classic sliced pork over bland pieces of broiled chicken, so I always ask to substitute with pork. I always make sure the server understands and confirms that it is fine, but every time my ramen comes with chicken and I have to send it back. They then look at me and ask to reconfirm like they are hearing the request to substitute pork for the first time. Maybe they think I'm weird to eat chicken broth ramen with pork but hey if you tell me it's ok then please get it right the first time! Ok story aside their ramen is pretty good and consistent, and they have expanded the menu to offer more items than just the ramen choices. This location is also my favourite just because it is roomy and not super hot inside."}
{"text":"This place needs to expand a little.  Noodles are pretty heavy and soup is super rich.  The seasoned egg is a must try.  I'm a cheese lover so I fell in love with the cheese ramen instantly. Don't forget your butter in ramen"}
{"text":"Food is good, but not great. I think it's been over-hyped a lot. I've tried all the ramen (except for the chicken ones), and I wasn't a big fan of them. The broth is nice, and their pork is fatty and tasty, but thsts about it. It's a good hang over food, but I would go to Konjiki, Shoryuken, Sansotei, for ramen if I was craving ramen.  And I also had a pretty disappointing experience with their service (which brought the rating from 3.25/5 to 2/5). I've been to this location multiple times and their service is usually nice. But the last time I visited, the lady that waited us was very rude. When we asked for a napkin or water, she eye-rolled at us. And the second time we asked for water (since she only poured it half way the first time), she let out a sigh and rushed over to pour water into our cups quarter of the way and left. And she seemed extremely irritated in the restaurant and we were wondering what her deal was. So I wrote an email to the place and I didn't get any reply whatsoever. I'm always very polite when I talk to the waiter/waitress, and I'm pretty sure I didn't do anything to offend her but the last experience left a bad impression.  Another thing I didn't like about their service was in October. I wanted to try out their October special (Thick/Creamy Tonkotsu Shoyu), so I asked ahead to ask if it was available in the evening. They told me that it will be, but when I went, the staff told me that it was a lunch special. So I called the place later that week to ask when they stop serving the dish and they told me that they have plenty of it so I can come in later in the evening. So I go over, and they tell me that they are sold out. And then for the third time, I call them on Saturday at noon to ask if they have their special and they said yes. So I come over and they tell me that they don't serve the dish any more since they don't have the ingredients. They then tell me that they sold out earlier during the week which made no sense. And I was with my friends for the 3 visits different group of friends), and they really wanted to try out Kinton so I went in reluctantly."}
{"text":"Impressive ramen soup!!!! After going to kinton ramen, I really cannot bear any other ramen restaurants. The fried dumplings were also excellent."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is better than the taste. You should wait pretty long time during rush hours"}
{"text":"I had been to this Kinton Ramen's location twice and enjoyed my experience both time. This location being new is quite busy and the staff a little green. But those would improve when the hype dies down.  Spicy Garlic Pork Ramen ($11.99) and Original Chicken Ramen ($10.99) both I really enjoyed as I finished everything and earned my Kinton Bowler's stamps. I do enjoyed the chicken broth as it was clean taste and creamy. The chicken breast was soft and tender.  Kakimayo ($4.50 each) Baked oyster was meh and disappointment. The oyster were chopped and mixed in with the mushroom. The seasoning was so strong as I can barely taste the mushroom and oyster apart.  I would stick with Ramen from now on.   Service was excellent during both of my visit. The staff checked on me constantly and came by a few times to refill my water. Food served in a reasonable time.  But if your dinner mate doesn't like loud music, staff yelling in Japanese, uncomfortable wooden seating and sharing a communal table. I really suggest not to bring that person here. You would ended up having a miserable time, like I did!"}
{"text":"Kinton Ramen the newest Ramen Joint in Toronto. It is always exciting to have new Ramen restaurants in Toronto.   Will I wait for a hour to eat here?! No...   How is their Food? Decent... and fulfilling savoury and oily :)  Goya ($3.50) is A OK... but I had better... order this if you are really hungry as the Ramens took forever to arrive!!  Kimchi ($3) totally NOT worth it!! 5 little pieces of kimchi...though has quite a delicate taste  Cheese Ramen with Pork Belly ($10.80) - I can see the layer of oil film on top of my broth...  - Pork Belly is smallish.... I think I would try pork shoulder next time - Surprisingly the Swiss Cheese went really well with the broth...  - This is just a little heavy on a hot summer day... especially when the restaurant is hot and stuffy!!  My friend has the Shoyu Ramen ($9.80) looks A-OK... especially the soft boiled egg looks deliciously good...   The noodle itself are cooked al dente...and have a good bite. The broth are all pork based and you have a choice of light and rich.   I don't mind coming back to Kinton Ramen if I don't have to wait for a table... as I want to try probably the Spicy Garlic or the Miso broth.... and I will try to get a seat near the front of the restaurant as I don't want to smell like pork and sweat like pigs while I enjoy my ramen!"}
{"text":"This is a small but upscale looking from the outside looking ramen place. The warm loud welcome when you step in sets the tone for the visit with a warm friendly service.  The ramen choices are quite simple with either a pork or chicken based ramen stock. from there you can add your taste options and other add-on options.  I had the garlic pork and my wife had the spicy kimchi chicken ramen.  The food was delicious and we finished everything down to the last drop which is a prerequisite to get a 'stamp' in the frequent eater card. You get a stamp for every meal and once you accumulate enough, you get some freebies!  Overall an excellent experience and we will be back!"}
{"text":"The quality is not consistent with the other Kinton locations. I had the pork shoyu today and it was salty. It made me sick. The pork was definitely not torched. Torching the pork makes a huge difference with the taste. I'm not sure why my meal was half assed when it didnt seem like they were short staffed. The service was okay but not great compared to the 2 other locations. Its disappointing because this location is close to home. But I rather drive further to get a better quality of ramen."}
{"text":"Not a huge fan of ramen, but I really like the ramen here. I've been here twice now, the first time I went with the original chicken ramen with chicken breast for protein. It was alright in my opinion, nothing exceptional. Not a huge meat fan, so I didn't like the texture of chicken in the ramen. This time around however, I ordered the vegetarian ramen off the special menu and I really enjoyed it. The deep fried tofu they serve as the protein component is super tasty and the presentation is nicer than its  meat counterpart. FYI, the portion sizes are humongous imo, so be prepared to eat a lot when you come here."}
{"text":"Good ramen place in DT. I personally love their atmosphere, friendly and cozy. Customized ren was one of my favorite, not mention the chicken swekwer"}
{"text":"Got to the restaurant around 2pm, and it wasn't too busy. Not sure if the summertime weather had anything to do with it. I ordered the regular shoyu ramen with pork belly. As usual, it was pretty tasty."}
{"text":"Despite their various locations, I have only been to this Kinton, and I've only been here once. The ramen here is pretty decent, but just standard and nothing that special in my opinion. Definitely nothing to warrant the lineups that I see outside whenever I pass by. Luckily my friends and I came fairly early in the morning (around 6 PM), so we only had to wait like 10 minutes to be seated. I ordered the pork ramen with light broth and pork belly. The portion was fine, and everything about the noodles were fine, and because I got light broth it wasn't too salty, but while I was satisfied I definitely wasn't blown away. My friend got the cold ramen with quail egg and I actually thought that was a lot more interesting and flavourful. Between three people we also shared a Kinton Ball LOL which is a scotch egg with sweet chili mayo. Kind of interesting, I think it's worth trying once. Other than that though, Kinton is just standard, okay ramen."}
{"text":"Me and my friends came just before the dinner rush, so we got a table right away. The restaurant itself is very nice, comfortable atmosphere and good music. I ordered the march special, paitan cheese supreme, and I have to say, it was a supreme bowl of ramen. The mixture of gooey soft cheese with the amazing chicken broth is orgasmic for my taste buds. I also ordered a side of jalapeno paste for the ramen, and it just enhanced the flavours. The chicken was very tender, and the noodles were cooked just right. I would definitely come back to eat it again."}
{"text":"Cold Sunday in fall after a night of wine and dancing... perfect place to regain nourishment. Kind service, hot ramen, cold bubbly Sapporo, and the proper japanese authentic atmosphere. Food was fantastic. Perfect miso pork ramen... the chicken option looked interesting, but pork just seems right. Kompaii"}
{"text":"Acid jazz. Wood block decor. Japanese greetings shouted from behind the counter. And tasty noodles. Kinton makes a good bowl of Ramen. Not the most variety in ingredients, but I like it all the same. Rich, spicy broth with pork belly goes down so nice on a cold winter's night."}
{"text":"I wasn't that impressed, honestly. I went tonight with my SO and overall it was (at best) a thoroughly average experience.  We were greeted promptly when we came in and waited about 2 minutes for a table. We got a freshly cleaned table on the banquet, but I took the stool. Part of my unhappiness: I personally don't think backless chairs are a good thing for anyone sitting for more than five minutes. I sat in it because my partner had worked all day and deserved a comfy seat; I just think it's a shame we both didn't have comfy seats to choose from. /Rant  I found the service super uneven. The woman came to take our order within a couple of minutes, but disappeared for almost 10 when I said we needed a minute to decide. They also forgot my side dish, which irked me.  As for the food? It was just ok, which was disappointing. SO didn't want ramen so his choices were extremely limited. He ordered two cold tapas dishes and they were...bad. the Don Don looked and tasted like cat food (same texture as tinned tuna, but without sauce) and the chicken karage was horribly overcooked. I got pork ramen in original broth, and was pretty underwhelmed. Considering what we paid, the portion was both small and plain: 2 sheets of nori, a smallish slice of roast pork, limp slice of bacon/belly and a seasoned egg. Really? Yeah, I get they make money by offering add ons, but ffs don't put your need to make money ahead of serving good food. There's enough good ramen in this city (check out Nakayoshi on Danforth) that no one should be paying $15 for a bowl of fricking ramen unless it's served to you personally in a golden chalice by the queen of bloody England. Whilst riding on the shoulders of Godzilla. And even then you should still be getting some change back.  Ironically, the gyoza side dish that they forgot was the tastiest thing I tried tonight. Once we got it, of course...."}
{"text":"I am not sure that the ramen is better than or maybe even equal to Kenzo Ramen on Bloor but it sure is livelier and a prettier place to sit."}
{"text":"This is my favourite place for traditional ramen in Montreal so far.  Good choice of noodles and broth and you can choose between pork and chicken bases.  The noodles have a really good flavour and stiffness.   I'll be back soon."}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to eating here since a friend told me to try this place when I was visiting Toronto. She told me the garlic ramen was amazing and anything that comes in limited qualities already sounds like something I need to try. I usually order the spicy ramen but decided to change it up and went with the garlic tonkotsu ramen (low sodium), with my usual thin noodles for a significant reduction in the amount of carbs. There  are two types of noodles; thin and fat. My husband and I chose the pork miso ramen and pork shoyu ramen. Both dishes came with creamy and delicious broth. I asked for spicy paste but unfortunately they didn't offer any, wish they let you pick spicy level. I gave them four stars because pork slides (chashu) weren't soft enough to chew. The portions were good too- sometimes ramen can be this huge bowl but this was perfect. Also, it was overwhelmingly salty.   We also started the Takoyaki which was good so I would recommend getting it here if you like it. They came with four balls. My husband ordered lemonade Asahi, good concept but wasn't that great. However, service was ok. Definitely a place that you should give it a try if you are in town."}
{"text":"*4.5 stars  Kinton Ramen is a popular chain of ramen restaurants with five locations in Ontario. They recently opened their fifth location adjacent to Kinka Izakaya on Church St. What I enjoy most about Kinton Ramen is the consistency of their food products, and portion-wise. The fifth location of Kinton Ramen features their signature block designs with high table-top and wooden tables. However, in contrast to some of the other locations, this location has large windows that allow natural light in.  Step 1 (broth) - select from pork ramen or chicken ramen Step 2 (flavour) - choose from original, shoyu, miso, spicy garlic, or extra pork Step 3 (noodle) - choose from thick or thin Step 4 (meat) - choose from pork or chicken (additional meat is +$2.50) Step 5 (additional toppings) - choose from a variety of toppings such as sweet corn, nori, seaweed, scallions, Swiss cheese, and more.  I opted for their Original Pork Ramen ($10.99) - sea salt, bean sprouts, scallions, nori, seasoned egg with corn (+$1) and seaweed (+$1). This is my usual ramen order whenever I eat at Kinton Ramen, as I do like lighter broths. The broth is also rich in collagen, and one can order it light, regular, or rich. Aside from the broth, I believe that the pork belly is also an important component of a bowl of ramen. The pork belly here are slightly blowtorch to give it a nice charred finish, which I quickly ate. The bowl also comes with a seasoned egg, which is a nice addition to a hot bowl of ramen.   Kinton Ramen also has a nice selection of hot tapas available like edamame, original karaage, takoyaki, and more. I always get the age gyoza ($3.90) - deep fried pork dumplings with original sweet chili sauce, so this time was no different. Each order comes with four pieces of aromatic and lightly deep-fried gyoza. Kinton Ramen is actually one of my favorite places for gyoza, and it goes well with the accompanied sweet chili sauce.   Kinton Ramen 5 is a good place to dine, especially if you're looking for a quick dinner. It can get pretty busy during the dinner rush, but I do find the turnover to be rather quick. Kinton Ramen 5 is open Monday to Sunday from 11:30 am - 10:30 pm."}
{"text":"A couple of my friends and coworkers were going to try Kinton's Mega Ramen challenge, so I decided to tag along and watch the action. The place is nicely designed with a casual and upbeat atmosphere you would expect at a izakaya restaurant, complete with a Japanese staff that welcomes you a jovial traditional Japanese cheer of a greeting. The kitchen is wide open in the middle of the restaurant where you can watch them assemble the ramen bowls. The place is rather hot and humid, which you would expect when the restaurant is constantly pumping out bowls of ramen. The music playing there was a medley of pop song covers in a Japanese karaoke style, it was a tad on the loud side but was really cheeky and fun to listen to.  On a cold night, a hot bowl of ramen in a creamy broth is definitely a perfect comforting meal, however the Mega Ramen bowl is another story:  The Mega Ramen bowl consists of a large bowl of ramen with 2 extra servings of noodles, topped with 6 pieces of pork shoulder, 4 pieces of pork belly, 1 seasoned egg, a sheet of nori and 3 servings of beansprouts. It was one big-ass towering bowl of ramen! It costs $30, but the challenge is to consume the entire bowl including the broth in less than 15 minutes and it's free with your name on their wall of fame and bragging rights.  You will need to sign a waiver before embarking on this challenge.   When I was there were about 10 other people doing the Mega Ramen challenge, and it was definitely a very entertaining scene, with many people going over to other tables to watch and cheer on people struggling trying to down the massive mountain of ramen with some taking photos in awe.  Meanwhile back to my meal:  I started off with the fried chicken starter, which was a basket of nuggets of whole chicken meat which was lightly dusted in flour and fried and served with a Japanse mayo. It was so tender, juicy and delicious especially with a squeeze of lemon and a healthy dunk of mayo. I highly suggest ordering this. The menu had a great selection of ramen bowls, with various choices of broth, meats and optional toppings, so you can customize your ramen to your liking. I had the Shoyu ramen with chicken soy broth and pork shoulder and I added jalapeno paste for an added spicy kick. It was a great combination. I love the mellow and mildly spicy broth and the slices of pork shoulder were tender and had a slightly smoky taste -- the pieces of pork were lightly flamed with a blow torch before it went into the ramen. The chicken broth had crumbles of chicken meat which added a nice texture to the broth base. I really like the seasoned egg which was perfectly boiled with a soft creamy yolk. I don't normally finish all of the broth in a ramen bowl, but I did this time not only because it was tasty but also to get your photo taken with your empty bowl and with your own comments featured on their Instagram page. You also get a stamp on their frequent \"bowler\" card for various rewards.  My friends didn't finish their Mega bowl in the 15 minutes, they didn't even finish half of it, but they could take the rest home to enjoy for later -- they were literally sweating from the mass consumption. There were four Japanese guys at the bar next to us who all did the Mega bowl and were so entertaining to watch. A couple of them came close and it was funny to see them leave the restaurant looking wheezy and taking a rest and a smoke on the bench outside. They were amazing sports and were happy to have their pictures taken even though looked like he was about to throw up.  There were about half a dozen of people on the wall of fame which many of them finishing at just under 15 minutes with the leader clocking in at an unbelievable 9 minutes!  I myself would rather enjoy my ramen at my own pace. Even though I had the regular size  The food is tasty and reasonably priced, and the atmosphere is fun. It's comforting and will lift your spirits at the same time. I will definitely make use of my Bowler card!"}
{"text":"I have never tried one ramen place I will say it's awful. But this one is really really bad. I tried their chicken ramen. The broth is so oilly that you will see half inch of oil floating on top of the broth. I'm not a big eater but the noodle portion is so little and they will give two thin pieces of chicken that I have to eat another meal after. Oh let's not to forget I waited a long 25 mins for this noodle during the non peak hour. This place is way overpriced. Can't believe I waste $15 with $5 parking on this."}
{"text":"Happy to see another Ramen Place open up in Scarborough. I gave it 4 stars as it did not top up my favourite ramen that we always go to almost every 2 weeks. But I will give their gyoza a 5. It was delicious, it was serve fried with chili sauce mix with mayo on top. I had the Original ramen, it has just a plain taste. There is additional charge if you want to add some toppings like corn. It was nice that they have fresh lemonade on the drink menu. We also ordered Green Tea Pudding with Hogicha which we enjoyed. I would probably try a different ramen on the menu like the miso."}
{"text":"Had lunch here, it was alright. The space is very small, hence the long lineups during peak hours in the evening. If you sit at the bar, it's easy to keep bumping the person next to you; maybe they're going for an authentic Japanese experience??   I ordered Miso pork belly ramen which came with an egg (always get it with an egg) and seaweed.   The pork belly was delicious, but I felt it was a small amount, could've been more. The broth was good, not too salty. The thick noodles felt a bit under-cooked.   I also ordered takoyaki, they were good, fairly standard. You get 4 pieces for $4.  I spent about $16.50 before tip, which felt a bit pricey for the meal I had.   All in all I liked this place, just thought it was kind of expensive and the noodles could've been better. Also a very small location."}
{"text":"First:   I find it absolutely necessary to comment on a previous review:  \"The spicy garlic ramen looked special so my husband ordered that. It has a strong garlic taste, but besides that it really isn't that special. Alert: DO NO ORDER THIS IF YOU ARE ON A DATE!  I could smell the garlic on my hubby the whole night after dinner even after tons of mints, and as you can imagine, it was not pleasant/romantic at all!\" - BKH.  It's called the 'Spicy Garlic Ramen'. If you order it expecting anything different, I am actually hoping that your date turns out poorly. Even if it *is* just with your husband. Your review is ridiculous.   I am actually kind of mad. I'm sorry if that tints the rest of my review. Know that my review is very positive when not tainted by such ridiculousness. Spicy Garlic Ramen.... geesh.   Kinton is, in my mind, the best ramen in town. I have previous given that title to A-Ok - but they have closed their doors... Kinton could throw some Goji berries in a bowl and it would compare quite nicely. I'm probably not being fair.   Kinton is just as about taste and feeling and experience that the whole guu empire provides. If you think that you are going for just a bowl of ramen, you won't really appreciate what is happening. Coming from the Guu family, it's like saying you are going to Guu for just the sushi. That ridiculous. It's about so much more.   But the bowl of ramen you are provided with is (right now) the best in the city."}
{"text":"Kinton ended up being a bit pricey for Ramen. I did get the Karage but was disappointed in the portion size. Oh well.  I got the spicy ramen which was perfect for the cold day I went. I would recommend the spicy ramen if you want to try something different snd are good with the .  I'll be honest. I won't frequent this location too often. But it's overall decent."}
{"text":"Haven't been back here for a few month, it's disappointing to find that the quantity of good as gone down. My spicy garlic Ramen comes with two small thin slice of  pork in my bowl. And the quality is gone down as well, my friend ordered the thin noodle for his bowl, the noodle is not properly cooked. Our appetizer fried chicken, one of the piece was cut open, I believe the chef wasn't sure if the chicken is cooked inside. Not satisfied at all."}
{"text":"Im a huge fan of ramen but this one just didn't do it for me.   First my friend and I were asking the waitress about the difference between the thick and thin noodles. All we wanted to know was if the thin noodles is the same kind used in instant noodles but as simple as our question was, she spent a good 5 minutes trying to draw and explain the difference when she could of easily just shown it to us.   Second, the big wooden spoon you have to use looked very used, they need to get rid of those things.   Finally, way too much garlic is added on top of the noodles over powering the soup. Im a garlic lover but it was just not good. I had to spoon most if it out. Also pricey for what it was."}
{"text":"Service is good. Friendly and attentive staff. The wait is a little longer than expected. Took about 30-35 minutes for our food to come out. I got the pork spicy ramen and flavour was really good. However, it would be nice to have a bit more meat. There is only 2 strips of pork, but there is an extra pork add on option"}
{"text":"Good service and atmosphere but the ramen soup was bland. The ramen noodles were good but nothing  very memorable. I really wanted to like this place as there aren't as many ramen places in this area. I was disappointed in the soup but it might be partly my fault for not asking more information about the soup. I might try this place again in the future though but not willingly."}
{"text":"I gave this Kinton location another try, from my previous experience I really did not like it all. So I decided to go at a later time, and this time it wasn't as busy. The service this time was way better than last time I went. This time the staff were more attentive, and checking up on all the guest eating. The reason why I am saying that is because I sat in the corner of the restaurant and I was observing, my whole time I was there. They checked up on us a couple of times, and I can say this time I went everything was better. The soup wasn't just warm it was nice and hot, the food the quality was much better. The only thing that was not acceptable was the Takoyaki took forever to make, it came after my ramen, and I was too full to eat it. Usually this is an appetizer and it would be one of the first thing that comes out.   Service: 3/5 Food: 3/5 Environment: 3/5  Overall: 3/5"}
{"text":"It was my first time having ramen from this franchise, I heard a lot of good things about it since it was open. A lot of my friends said it was pricy for the portion it provides, when it comes to ramen I would not mind quantity but I look into the quality of the broth and noodle. When I went with my cousin the place was not packed, but this location is small just like the other locations downtown. I see people lining up for this ramen location downtown all the time.   I went to this location a few months back, and can never forget my first experience with ramen. When I paid for the tab it was lower than I expected so I would not say it is pricy. The food was delicious I ate everything and drinking most of the broth. I enjoy any noodle with soup as long the broth is hot. We also order the Hot Karaage, and I only remember it is call spicy fried chicken. I still remember every time someone leaves/ enter the restaurant they would yell in Japanese. One negative thing about this place besides the environment being small, i had to pay for parking since there is no free parking. Overall, my whole experience with Kinton Ramen - North York was excellent.   Food: 5/5 Service: 5/5 Environment: 4/5 Cleanliness: 4/5  Overall: 4.5/5"}
{"text":"The grand opening is tomorrow but  there was a soft opening and we decided to check it out.   We got the original  pork ramen and it met the standards of what a Ramen should be . The noodles were soft and the pork meat was tender and well cooked..  What  was good is their bowl promo where you   can get various prizes upon completion of certain numbers of bowls. That's enough to get return trips as well as try out various other ramen available. Overall this is a good ramen place  for ramen fans or those looking for a comfortable meal."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness! How have I never been in here before? From the getgo, this place gives off the warmest vibes - anytime anyone walks in, the entire staff greets them in the loudest and most friendly way possible (and yes, this means that this place is loud - which doesn't bug me at all, but in case that's not something you're looking for.) The service is fast and literally everyone working there is so nice and kind! I ordered the vegetarian ramen, and I have literally never been so impressed with a vegetarian ramen option ever. It looked so good, that the woman sitting next to me turned to me and said \"what IS that? It looks amazing!\" (Which is proof to me that everyone should be trying to be eat vegetarian at least once or twice a week, but I digress...) The ramen was so flavorful and it was also HUGE - I could've easily split it with someone else and still not be able to finish it. I'll definitely be back here next time I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"Pretty good Not the most comfortable seating Good for 2 ppl, but not 3. Decent fried chicken"}
{"text":"Pretty good I like two pieces of thick pork, but I can taste the msg(dashi) in the soup and it was quite a bit salty. Also, it would be great if you guys put more sprout beans or other veggies into the soup. The service is very good. Staffs are very friendly and I like the music in the store.  Also,  I think you guys have to divide the thickness of the noodle into three sections( very thin/ thin/ thick). I ordered thick noodles, but it was actually thin, while I was expecting very thick noodle."}
{"text":"I've been to two other Kinton locations in downtown Toronto and this location does justice to the brand. I've been here twice so far and I find that the appetizers and the ramen are just as good as the ones downtown.  Unlike other Kinton locations, which were narrow, this one is quite spacious. There are tons of tables for two and four, seats in front of the cooks, and large tables in the center for large parties. The corner lot provides tons of light through the windows. This place always seems busy, but I've haven't had a problem finding a seat.  I found the takoyaki to be very tasty, with cut up octopus and a soft inside. When I ordered the gyoza, I thought I was going to receive steamed gyoza, but it turned out to be deep fried. The presentation was odd, some decorative greens on the side and covered in sweet chili sauce. The taste on the other hand was fantastic. The gyozas were packed full of pork and the sweet chili sauce is as described, giving the gyoza a sweet flavor with a little spice kick.  The ramen and ramen broth are exactly the same as the other locations I've visited. The first time I came here I accidentally ordered the shoyu chicken ramen, which I thought was a little too salty and also didn't include an egg. On my second visit, I ordered the original chicken ramen, which included an egg and wasn't too salty. What I really enjoyed about the ramen is the tender chicken and the creamy broth. The egg was not fully soft, but some of it was overcooked. I still enjoyed it, though."}
{"text":"I've heard so many good things about Kinton, so I decided to give it a try. I came here on a Tuesday at 1pm, and the restaurant was busy but not packed. It was packed around 2pm though.  I ordered the cold tea, which was refreshing on a hot Toronto day. I also ordered the shoyu ramen with chicken. As part of the lunch special, I also received an appetizer that consisted of pork on top of rice. The rice in the middle had some type of light sauce in it, which made it extremely tasty. Give me that any day! The ramen was okay. I was a little disappointed given all the hype. I've been to Santouka and prefer their ramen over Kinton. The broth at Santouka was much heartier, and I also prefer the ramen noodles at Santouka. The chicken itself was nice and tender/soft. I really enjoyed it. The best part of the entree was the soft-boiled egg. It was perfect, and the yolk was still runny (yum!).  The lunch special comes with a drink, the appetizer, and a ramen noodle in broth for $13 + tax."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner last night and ordered the veggie noodle.  They asked me if I wanted the thick or thin noodle so I thought the ramen was the thin noodle.  I was sad because the thin noodle had a more Lo mein taste so I didn't really enjoy the soup.  I wouldn't wait in line to eat here.  Prices are okay and they have combos."}
{"text":"The original ramen was tasty, not too salty. I'm not sure I will always be willing to wait 30 minutes for a seat, but I have to say the bowl of ramen was satisfying. If you are extra hungry, a side of corn and bean sprouts will definitely fill you up.   Just make sure your entire group has arrived as they don't seat you until everyone is present."}
{"text":"I like the fact that they have untraditional ramen types like 'Jalapeno Chicken', it makes it a lot easier for someone who hasn't had ramen before to open up to trying/liking it! Overall I'm a big fan, it is one of my go-to ramen places in the area. They have a pretty good deal that involves a bowl ramen and a pint of Sapporo, I'll definitely return!"}
{"text":"2 ou 3 visites déjà et j'adore ! Mon ami vietnamien me fait découvrir plusieurs endroits à Ramen et celui ci est mon favori ! L'ambiance est très agréable, le staff est courtois, tout est délicieux ! :)"}
{"text":"ATMOSPHERE: It's a small restaurant with an Asian modern touch. The seats are a little bit small in my opinion and the place can get crowded (especially with winter wear). They should prepare more space for coats.  FOOD: Personally, I'm not the biggest fan of Kinton. Something about the taste is unfortunately not exactly to my liking. Sometimes it's too salty or the flavor just isn't my cup of tea. It's not bad, I think it's just not for me.  PRICE: I find the ramen to be a bit overpriced. You can find much better for lower costs at other places in Montreal.  SERVICE: I will say that the service is always great. They greet you warmly as soon as you walk in and will be of assistance to you until the end of your meal. Very friendly."}
{"text":"when they first opened, the pork belly portion and cut were huge!! now its so thin..price is a bit high fir the amount of meat you get. you can add in veggies/egg for $1-$2 each item. theyve recently did a ramen of the month and gave a festure menu of some new ramen too. i always get the spicy garlic pork ramen and the shinshin which comes w.a house spicy paste! Has a nice kick if youre into spicy food."}
{"text":"This is my go to place for Ramen...I've been there probably 5 times the past few months and can't get enough of this place..... if you like it spicy make sure you add grated garlic and the jalapeno paste.  Also, seating isn't very hard to come by (you never have to wait more then 10 mins) which is nice when i'm always travelling w/ the kids.  Worth a visit!"}
{"text":"Came into this cozy looking spot on a snowy afternoon and ordered the vegetarian ramen bowl. It...was...huge...and about 60% noodles and not as many vegetables as I would have thought. The place wasn't very full when we came in and it took forever to get service, but once we did, things were quick. I do not think that any human could finish the vegetarian ramen bowl given the massive amount of noodles in the bowl, but I sure gave it a try. It wasn't too salty and I was definitely full for a long time after, but really, it was nothing special and certainly not the best ramen in the city or anything.   The reason why I knocked an additional star off is for the fact that they refuse to punch your loyalty card if you don't eat every single bite of your lunch/dinner; the server admitted that it's nearly impossible to finish the vegetarian option given the amount of noodles, I personally think that it is ludicrous to charge 2 people the same exact price yet only reward the one people who ate the most...think I'll ever be back? Doubt it."}
{"text":"fabulous! One of the best ramen places I have ever been to and I have been to a lot.   This restaurant opens at 11:30a.m. so at around 11:20 lines were formed. I thought since it was such a hot day no one would go. I was wrong! I think Kinton has some good regulations before you get seated. For example, if you have a party of 4 and only 2 people are here, they will not seat you until everyone has arrived. THere are other rules but they are reasonable..  I have to say they take the initiative to try to cool down their customers as much as possible. They freeze metal cups or put them in the fridge so when you drink the water it feels really cold even if it has been left out for a while.  With that being said, there wasn't much air con but they did have multiple fans. The seating is more like the traditional Japanese ramen stands ( If you have been to Japan you would understand). Just seating infront of the chefs so like a ramen bar.   Food:  You have a selection of different ramen soups and whether you want it to be rich, normal or less rich (there was another term but I can't remember). Also, you have a selection of shoulder or belly pork. I enjoyed the soup as I found it not to be very salty. Also, I wasn't very thirsty after eating so I suppose there isn't  much MSG or any.   Overall, good place for a quick lunch but you MAY have to wait so be prepared!"}
{"text":"The few times I've been here, the food has been inconsistent which is why I'm only giving it a three star.  The first time I came here, I had the best bowl of chicken broth noodles. Delicious. Sure, the bathrooms were dark and the staff could barely speak English, but the food was super good. One of the best bowls I've had! We were also seated at a table w a booth so it was nice, it wasnt until I had to sit at the communal table that I realized how prime those seats were.   Based on my experience I returned twice more, both times the broth was SO salty neither my SO or I could finish the last third of my bowl. It was just Inedible. We were also seated at the bar once and the communal table once. These stools are really uncomfortable; not to mention there's no hook to hang your coat or bag. Try holding your parka and purse  in your lap while slurping up noodles if you want to  know what a truly inconvenient dining  experience is like. Also, there were speakers like blaring overtop of the communal table and the staff were yelling as well, so it was Really LOUD in there.  I'm no stickler,and I'm not talking loud like for an old person, but it was annoyingly loud. I don't enjoy shouting across the table.  The service was fairly good though.   Sadly, I don't think I'll be returning because there are other ramen Restos in Toronto that offer a more pleasant dining experience w good product eg: Santouka, Sansotei"}
{"text":"There's a wide variety of bases to choose from and I picked the spicy garlic soup and replaced the pork with chicken at no extra cost. Noodles were chewy and soup was flavourful. I wanted to get karage but I was too full from lunch. You can add more things at additional costs to your Raman and make it a combo as well. Combo consists of a small rice dish either with pork or chicken.   We came around 630 on a Saturday night and I was thinking that it'll be super busy but we didn't have to wait long for a seat. There wasn't a line up outside too which was a plus for us since we were tight on time.   Kinton is prob my fav ramen joints so far and I would come back to any of their locations in Toronto. I can't wait till they open the one in the mississauga location!! Hollaa at me"}
{"text":"Located in Kennedy Commons which is acquiring quite a few new restaurants.  Kinton is small but bright. Tables in the centre has short stumps for chairs. You'll have to use the coat rack to hang your jacket. I ordered the miso pork with thin noodles. The soup was hot and savory, not salty at all. Pork was tender but only 2 slices. $12.99 a bowl, green tea was $2. Had I known I would have ordered the lunch combo for $14.99 instead. It would have included a small side."}
{"text":"This location is probably my favourite location out of all the Kinton Ramens.  Recently came here on a Tuesday at around 8pm, the place was still packed. A table for 5 took about 10 minutes.  Ordered the Black Tonkatsu Shoyu again. The broth at this location is stronger and more flavourful compared to the one i tried on Baldwin street. The pork is also softer and tastier.   Karaage here is a little to crispy but the chicken inside is really juicy.  Service was not that great. The waitress looked like she did not want to be here. She was somewhat rude.   Besides the service. Overall, this location is better than the others. Ramen here seems more legit and not watered down."}
{"text":"Meh. Been here twice and had time to think about this. I had the spicy pork ramen and the miso pork ramen.   What I like about this place is the terrasse, the firm and chewy noodles (which are very thin), the nicely marinated egg, and the fact that you get featured on IG if you finish the bowl.  ...and that's all I can come up with.  At best, it's a 3.5/5 and this is my reasoning:  First, both broths (spicy and miso) lack a depth of flavor. It seems like they have been watered down as, for some reason, my tastebuds simply aren't excited.  Then, the spicy soup didn't deliver the heat I was expecting. It was barely spicy and tasted almost unsalted.   Finally, the pricing is comparable to Yokato Yokabai, which is about 20$ after taxes and tips. But the ramen at Yokato Yokabai is significantly tastier.   Probably will not come back considering the many options around this part of town."}
{"text":"First of all the ramen was not very good at all, no option for bamboo shoots.  The male waiter was very rude to my friend and I, told us we had to finish our drinks outside while allowing others to bring in their drinks, and threw our dishes to the table from 10 cm away.  Definitely will not visit again."}
{"text":"Food was okay but service was pretty terrible... we came in late at night when there weren't too many people and still it took 10 min to wave someone down to get our order and another more than 40 min to actually get our food. When we tried to wave people down, some waitresses just stared at us and ignored us. We didnt even get water until after we were able to order. Overall I would not recommend. You might as well spend that 30 min they make you wait driving somewhere else (sansotei)."}
{"text":"We were seated at the bar but they also have table seats though seating is pretty scarce in general. You pick your own broth, flavour (miso, spicy, etc.), soup, noodle, meat, and toppings. It's all laid out on a menu by steps + very easy to follow. I ended up getting the original with extra meat, which is supposed to be 3x the original amount. Overall, it was okay - I thought the portions were kind of small. Considering I got extra meat, I can't imagine how much meat would be in a normal portion. The service was fast and nice- nothing extraordinary."}
{"text":"Noodles were nicely firm and surprisingly the broth was not too salty (which I find is usually a problem with other ramens restaurants)   Service was quick and neat. This place is definitely in my top 5 ramen restaurants of Montreal."}
{"text":"I have been to the Kinton Ramen at Baldwin downtown.  I really enjoyed my experience at that location.  I ordered the same thing as I always do when I go to Kinton.  Spicy garlic with double the meat.    It was as good as I have had it.  Ramen consist of many complex components that gives it the unique taste.  The broth was great, it is a preference at the end of the day, I enjoy the rich broth miso base.  The richness for me is a perfect marriage with the thick noodles.  It is silky and milky.  The ramen was great, not soggy but soft and chewy.  The meat!  I loves it, the double meat is a combination of pork shoulder and pork belly.  The pork belly is a no brainer, every bite was some humbly flavoured meat with a coast of butter belly goodness.  The pork shoulder was tender and juicy.  My favourite part is the grinded ball of garlic. I never break it into my soup.  I take a piece of belly and shoulder dip in the soup and place a niblet of the garlic on top and the garlic marries it all together.  I loved it based on my tastes.  The service is could probably improve a little more as the location at Baldwin is relatively good.  The lineups are no big deal, good food attracts people.  The only thing I would say is the wait staff should be a little more attentive.  I wasn't offered a drink immediately when I was seated and I had to wave someone down when I was ready to order or needed something.  The service is good but compared to their sister location they can improve.  I really just think that over time as the staff get accustomed to the busy traffic they will be more efficient.  Otherwise the service is very good.  The location is great, close to the subway and a nice large parking pad right next to the restaurant.  This locations deserves the five stars because it is an actual authentic ramen in that area."}
{"text":"I went there today and ordered the spicy garlic ramen, the soup was very watered down not like before."}
{"text":"Im a fan! The ramen is delicious! Why have we haven't gone sooner? It has all the flavours of Unami! I really wanted to try the fried chicken ramen but that is only available on Mondays.   Overall, it was very tasty and it was very filling. The prices were on par with other ramen places. I just can't believe how nice this restaurant is and so close to Ryerson. The meal for two people came to $30 for two bowls of ramen. The slivers of meat were thin and the egg was okay, not the best I have had."}
{"text":"Not too impressed with the ramen. I had the spicy garlic broth and a sweet and sour lemon specialty tea (it had a Japanese name). The broth wasn't the greatest. But what was great is the atmosphere and decide. Music is cute too. Constant yelling from the kitchen to hype up the guests, if you're into that. It's a fun place to be and to bring a friend or two. But the food itself, during y first and only visit, is only okay."}
{"text":"You'd think that such a well established and aesthetically pleasing restaurant would have at least halfway-decent ramen just to shut you up as you watch all the staff holler at people who come in and out of the shop. You'd think. I was legitimately shocked at the staleness of all the ingredients. Ramen is a soul food, and this eating here, made my soul cry."}
{"text":"The service here is really good although subtle. It is not exactly my type of place, but I was impressed.  Friend found the best time to come is 10 minutes before their opening. You can catch their chants and they are attentive and remember who came first. Because they seat you accordingly although they wont tell you. The best seat in the house is right in front of the shouting japanese men. You eat and watch them shout. They offer japanese beer too, should be good in the summer with ramen.  I think they have the best eggs here out of all the ramen shops in Toronto. Their ramen portions and bowls are huge. So I am pretty sure you will be satisfied, even with a healthy appetite."}
{"text":"Had original pork ramen with thick noodles + rich broth. Wasn't terrible but wasn't even good either. Turn offs: 1/. Noodles were undercooked. I had to chew em quite a few times. And so couldn't actually \"slurp\" without risking indigestion either. 2/. The broth was not umami enough. And you could see literally chunks of nasty pork fat in the broth! 3/. The music's way too loud. I wanted ramen. Not rave. 4/. \"Thick\" noodles are more like regular sized. Same size as cooked Shin Ramuyn.  Maybe it's all because I went there around 2-3pm so what they prepared for lunch was gone and their dinner ramen broth still needed to cook down a bit. Or they have not-too-excited-about-ramen chefs during off-peak hours.   The seasoned egg is still on point and the portions are large-ish tho. (I used to live in Texas.) Pointers: Any of their chicken-based ramen portion is 3/4th of any pork-based ramen portion. My gf had a chicken ramen and it actually tasted a bit more umami than mine."}
{"text":"UPDATE  Full disclosure, I got a $30 gift cert from Kinton management for my troubles in the original review (posted below). Went back again and ordered the Miso ramen this time (got the shio, or original, the first time around). Soup was warmer but still not as hot as I would've liked. The charring on the meat was much better this time around; was pretty much non existent the first time. Most importantly we waited maybe 20-25 minutes for our noodles instead of the original 50. Still less than ideal but mildly acceptable, and if we had ordered apps probably would not have seemed extreme. There still does seem to be a bottleneck on the kitchen as you see bowls of noodles going out in batches rather than a constant flow, though apps seem to come out fairly consistently. The restaurant wasn't full so I'm hesitant to give this a 4 stars without seeing if these kind of times remain when they kitchen is fully stressed, but I could see it moving up there if so, and if they manage to deliver noodles to the tables that are actually hot rather than warm-luke warm.   P.S. Music was also less loud than the first time, so that's a good improvement too. I also thought I'd mention that the design of the restaurant is nice, especially the coat hangers, but all of that generally is secondary to the overall dining experience to me. I still feel this location could be a 2 star or 4 star on any given night depending on how well the kitchen is operating.   ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Original 2 star review, late February timeframe  Got a table on a Saturday night without a problem. The people who came in afterwards can't say the same but that's just luck. Compared to other kintons, forget other ramen places, this location falls far short. The wait staff was fine but the kitchen seems very poorly managed. The noodles took about 40 minutes after ordering to come and they were subpar. Broth lacked flavour and was a bit cold. Meat was not finished well like you might expect at other kintons (I've been to Yonge and Beverly locations). Music was way too loud. It seems to have seating capacity twice the kintons I've been to but the same size kitchen staff so you have to wait for a table anyways. Would not recommend unless you really want Japanese ramen, plenty of better restaurants in the plaza."}
{"text":"Came here recently on a Thursday night and it was packed.  Turnover was high, though, and we didn't wait for seats.  They don't seat a group until the entire party has shown up.  I was waiting for a friend, so they didn't seat me whenever seats became available until my friend showed up.  I waited, and others that arrived after me got sat before I did because they weren't waiting for others.  Personally, I completely agree with this practise and although it meant that I and to wait at the door for my friend to join me, I believe that every restaurant should do this.  I had high expectations because of the many reviews and articles that Kinton Ramen has been showcased in.  Maybe a little too high...  I wasn't as impressed with the food as I thought I would be.    I got the pork belly broth with regular noodles and pork shoulder, since it was my first experience at Kinton.  They make the noodles in house, and they're good, not soggy, not mushy, not over-cooked, made well.  But they weren't anything awesome.  The broth was ok, good but not awesome.  I felt like things didn't cook for long enough, like flavours weren't absorbed by the ingredients.  I like the atmosphere, it's fun and makes it more of an experience.  The service was good, the bartender was GREAT, and everyone was VERY friendly and accommodating.  Also, it was surprisingly cheap!  I might come back to try a different flavour.  But personally, I like the ramen and broth better at other places."}
{"text":"I have been to this Kinton location twice and I do enjoy the food quite a lot! I came with a group of friends on Thursday during lunchtime and it was packed. We had to wait 20 minutes, but the waiters are very friendly. From the outside, the location is a bit small, but it can fit more people than expected inside. I ordered the spicy garlic pork ramen and it was delicious. It had some spice and it was very flavourful. The pork was good and it had a lot of unami. You can choose between thick  or thin noodles. I personally prefer thick noodles because it has a chewier texture. The broth was a bit too salty so I did not drink it all. I also recommend the original pork ramen. It comes with a soft boiled tea egg that is seasoned to perfection. Eat it first so it does not become overcooked in the hot broth. I would definitely come again!"}
{"text":"Pretty great ramen especially since I came during their anniversary price of $5.18 for all their ramen.  Miso Pork (4/5)- I loved the large slices of pork cha shiu and the cut was just the right amount of fattiness. I got their thin noodles and liked the texture and firm chew on it. The broth was thick, savoury & salty so I really appreciated the fresh bites of corn & beansprouts.  The servers were polite and very fast. They're too busy to attend to you once you're seated and have your food though."}
{"text":"Ramen? Yes please! Was super excited for Kinton ramen to open up beside me but I am left underwhelmed. I've been to a Kinton downtown before and I felt it was the same quality at about 3 stars. (TBH I still haven't found my ramen spot yet)   Being new, I am giving them the benefit of the doubt but bro it's been like 2-3 months now. The basics needs to be covered! We came on Friday night at about 9:30. There were a few tables occupied but not crazy busy at all. I was pleasantly surprised at how large the place is and the really nice decor. It's very hip and new and I liked how there was a coat rack in the front (be careful of theft though).   Like other Kintons, they greet you loudly. The waitress was cleaning a bit then took a few minutes to seat us down. Honestly the priority should have been us first since there were a lot of empty and clean tables. Anywho, service was just slooow. I like to think I'm a realistic person, and after being seated for 15 minutes I would have liked to been asked if we wanted any drinks and if we could order without having to call for someone.   The wait time for the food was reasonable. Food was good. It's a decent but small bowl of ramen. My two friends ordered the spicy broth and I found it was sort of a rip off compared to the original broth. We had a nice egg, some seaweed and other good stuff while they literally just had chicken and the noodles. They both left still hungry and we went to McD's after. Ack.   Getting the bill was also a wait. It took 5ever and I'm not sure why. I guess they were balancing the books or something and our waitress was waiting on the side until the dude was ready to punch in our stuff. Another 10-15 minutes.   I really want to like this place but the service is slow as molasses and the food is ok. I can see myself coming back since it's literally beside me but I hope to see some improvement next time."}
{"text":"First and foremost, the staff is the best.  They ALL greet you when you walk in, and they ALL say goodbye to you when you leave, and just super friendly.  I enjoyed the dishes and cups they used, it was very different and interesting.  Now the food, their gyoza was delicious, and their chiki chiki don and their ton ton don were unlike anything I've ever eaten before, but very good :) !  I could've eaten sooo much more of that rice.  NOW, the pork miso ramen was just amazing, I was so happy when I took my first bite!  I only wish I had asked for extra pork. And lastly, the thing that made this place a 5/5 had to be the desert.  Most delightful and elegant cheesecake I've ever had!  Everything was delicious, and I would go back here tomorrow if I could!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty good! I've been there a few times and I really love there food. The only thing I'd probably change is the seating. Place is CROWDED with people and there are such little places to sit. Other than that, the Karage Chicken is to die for and the ramen is top notch."}
{"text":"Don't get what the hype and the hour long line-ups are about. Great service but mediocre food. I would have rather consumed all those carbs by eating poutine or a burger instead; what a waste."}
{"text":"some of the best ramen I ever had. My only complaint is my favourite dish, the fried chicken ramen, is randomly only available on Mondays... sucks when I come in or order from UberEats any other day and can't get it :( their regular chicken ramen is very good too, just the fried one is even better. Only getting 4 stars cause of that."}
{"text":"The food is so good. And this restaurant has excellent customer service!! Also it happened that its Monday specials! Will be back soon."}
{"text":"Nothing special, especially the soup  Same price you could get raijin ramen and Hokkaido ramen and they are both much better than kinton  Service is good though...."}
{"text":"Probably still my favourite place to frequent for ramen.  Offers a choice of how how rich you want your soup.  Friendly service and authentic Japanese atmosphere."}
{"text":"Disappointed how they have changed their menu for the worse and increased their prices. The vegetable ramen, now has less vegetables, switched the asparagus to broccoli and no longer includes an egg, for $1.50 more.  It was my favourite ramen but now that it is no longer the same, I really don't have much reason to go all the way there anymore."}
{"text":"First time coming here I wanted to leave seeing the line, but somehow managed to stay with the convincing of the manfriend. We stayed for nearly 2 hours with the lining up and getting our actual food, and the saddest part was it only took us 30 minutes or less to finish our food. I was convinced to never come back given how often I'm in downtown and kintons down there are plentiful with much better service.   Coming here a second time gave me a completely different experience and I hope it continues to stay like this or become even better. I understand it can get really busy during peak hours and given by how busy it was on a Tuesday evening, weekends are still probably the same as my first experience. However, I believe that the place will only get better with time. Food actually didn't take that long to get to us and other than the brief mix up with someone else's food, service has improved a lot.   Anyway, I got the sake ramune mojito and it was amazing. Y'all gotta try it, no regrets. By the end of the bottle, the drink became sweeter than what mojitos are generally like but I liked it just the way it was. Took a sip from my friend's bamboo (lychee juice with alcohol) and it was just as good. I really couldn't choose between mine and hers. I also came about to try the cheese ramen they advertised on their Facebook page, and as a lover of both cheese and ramen, together I could only imagine as a mouthwatering treat. I knew the concept existed before but it wasn't something I wanted to try since it appeared unappetizing to me at first. However, with a newfound bravery I did not know I had, I took the first step towards heaven. And so I saw the light with the first bite in and honestly it was the best thing I had ever tried in terms of ramen. Life changing. I'm never eating ramen without cheese again.   Normally the soup from kinton is very salty but the cheese managed to mask most of the saltiness, to a point where it wasn't a cringe job to drink the soup on its own (to get that bowler card); I didn't get to finish my bowl (but what else is new) but I can see myself finishing it with an empty stomach (I'd eaten not long prior to ramen). One day I'll get that card, mark my words!"}
{"text":"Generally speaking, I think this place is fine. Noodles are good. Meat in ramen is good. Main negative for me: their soups are a bit too salty for my taste. And I love me a little salt - so I think this is informative. They have a lemonade thing that's ok. Going back to the saltiness issue... this may not be the case with all their soup base options... I'm too undisciplined to have kept track of all of them (I don't even know if I've tried several of them - I've been to Kinton three or four times because it's in the middle of my (rare) walk from work to home)."}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with a $5 a bowl of ramen on their 5th year anniversary.   Sure, line up was long to get to this deal, but totally worth it for me!!  40 mins wait later, a staff member ushered my friend and i to a table in the bustling and an incredibly busy restaurant.  The original chicken ramen that i ordered came with a choice of thick or thin noodles.  The waiter suggested the thin ones for me as they tasted better with the chicken broth apparently.  He was right.  And he also recommended jalapeño on the side for a dash of spice.  And he was also right on that too!!!    The broth was really good, and i thoroughly enjoyed every bit of chicken slices, seaweed, and egg that came with the noodle soup.  This could be the beginning of a great love affair between Kinton Ramen and i.  Lol."}
{"text":"Grand opening with a promotion of $5.50 to $6 per bowl of ramen means predictably long line up and long wait.  And that's how it was with Kinton's new location grand opening at Eglington.  The wait lasted 1 to 1.5 hours, and for my group of 10, we had to be split up if we wanted to get in faster.  Thankfully the restaurant was organzied in the sense that one associate was outside the restaurant taking orders before we went inside.  And food came after we sat down shortly.  I ordered chicken shoyu thin noodle ramen and it tasted decent.  The soup could use a little less salt.  Other than that it was nice to enjoy this promotion."}
{"text":"This is one of two acceptable ramen places near work.  The other being Hakata Shoryuken, which I had stopped going to since it felt like they added MSG to their soup base.  When I asked the Kinton staff whether they had used MSG or not they said there wasn't.  From my observation, the broth itself does not feel like it had any MSG.  The taste from the meat and broth seemed natural.  However, the amount of noodles is very small and generally not even close to filling for $10.99 + taxes and tip going to about $14.  Unfortunately, I still got the MSG tingles in my mouth.  I am thinking that it may be their preserved egg that would have the MSG component.  Egg isn't supposed to be that flavorful.  I think started to feel the numbness on my tongue after eating the egg.  I would try it again just to confirm that it is the egg, but because I had the MSG feel I am only giving this place past a 3-star.  Though I don't think I would make it go higher as 3-star even when because of the price to quantity ratio and without the egg, it's not a complete ramen for me."}
{"text":"I've been to this location numerous times since it opened. Mainly for lunch but also a couple times for dinner. The menu is fairly standard/simple which makes it easy to choose what you want to eat. I try to come right at 12pm if I can because it gets busy fairly quickly. The service has always been great. Chairs are not the most comfortable and I hate having to hang up my jacket in the winter.   My go to is the Chicken Original or the Chicken Spicy Jalapeno. The broth is so rich and savoury for the Original. The Jalapeno kicks it up a notch and adds just the right amount of spiciness so that you can still finish the soup without dying! The chicken and egg are always cooked to perfection and I've never had an issue with the quality of the food here.  The Chikichiki Don is also really good. The meat to rice ratio is perfect. If I'm not feeling for ramen, I will order this along with other tapas instead, such as the Takoyaki.   I also love the Salmon Tataki, but unfortunately that's only available for dinner."}
{"text":"The broth was a bit salty, other than that, this is a good place if you have a small group. The staffs are friendly."}
{"text":"of all the ramen places springing up in downtown Toronto, i am not too impressed with Kinton. i have been there twice. it was decent but not my favorite. (second time was better with the spicy pork miso soup). my biggest problem is the very loud \"background\" music. even for lunch, you feel like you are in a club. too loud for any decent conversation. soups were also too salty for my taste. the lineup also is a turn off, especially when the food is just ok."}
{"text":"Great ramen, and spot on flavours. A little on the pricy side, 12 for the ramen and at least 4 for sides or apps. Servings sizes are substantial and fair. Overall a tasty bowl of ramen for a fair price, service is also great. Awesome spot for a quick lunch or dinner date!"}
{"text":"The food is great but they really need to turn down the volume of that crappy Japanese music."}
{"text":"Really good ramen joint. Their karrage is amazing and so are their tofu nuggets/kinton ball. Definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"One of my favourite ramen places in the city. I usually go for the combo which is a good deal. Gyoza are always great and consistent. I have tried both the original pork and chicken base, the shoyu pork and chicken base, and the spicy garlic pork base. My favourite is shoyu pork by far. The noodles are firm and hold up in the soup and the ratio of noodle to soup you get is good- enough to enjoy the noodles while not feeling like they are drowning. I normally get the thin noodles and pork shoulder/ belly as my choices. The homemade lemonade is also good, however it is a bit pricy for how much you get. The location itself is a bit small but you usually don't have to wait too long to get a table 10-15 minutes. They always greet you when you walk in and thank you when you leave in Japanese."}
{"text":"Show me? Shoyu!   I really can't get enough ramen. It's grown up Mr. Noodles, I mean really. What's not to love? I've only been to this spot one time, which is silly considering its proximity to my home, and I really enjoy it. As you can probably guess from my corny salutation, I went for the shoyu and matched it with pork and thin noodles.   I hate thick noodles ever since reading Roald Dahl's The Twits as a kid. You know when she replaces his spaghetti with worms? Yeah. I still think about that, so I always go thin... I digress.   Get the lunch special, and enjoy your salad and or gyoza. The gyoza come with some magical creamy sauce, which sounds weird, but it's so. tasty.   PEPPER'S PISSED: What about some hot sauce that isn't hot powder? I'd really like that for next time."}
{"text":"Shoyu ramen  Chicken original Spicy pork ramen  Pork original  Everything should be be upgraded to extra meat or you are missing out.  This is now on my permanent rotation list.   Everything is so juicy and tender. The broth is so thick and tasty. Authentic ramen is served here. Enjoy"}
{"text":"The three of us decided to try out Kinton Ramen during the soft opening. We arrived a bit past 6 and were able to get a table immediately. The interior design is very similar or almost the same as the Toronto location. However, this location is more spacious.   I ordered the original pork ramen. The guys both got the spicy pork ramen. It took longer than usual for our ramen's to come out. Hopefully they will become quicker by grand opening.  We all enjoyed our ramen. The pork was very tender and delicious. Sadly there were only two slices of meat. The broth was delicious as well. I think for $12.99 there should be 1-2 extra piece of meat. Most of the ramen were the noodles.   Glad there is more than one option for ramen in Mississauga now!  FYI- Kinton Ramen is in the new Parkside condo. Parking may be hard to find for non-residents."}
{"text":"After passing by Kinton Ramen several times and seeing how crowded it was me and my sister had to see what the hype was all about.  We arrived for lunch and waited about 10 minutes before we were seated. We got an order of the shio and shoyu ramen with pork shoulder. I thought that the soup base was a bit too strong even when I got the normal soup base. Overall, I thought it was decent minus the soup base. If you finish the entire bowl you'll get your picture taken...from what I noticed.  I must've came in with high expectations because Kinton Ramen only got 3 stars."}
{"text":"We had gotten to the restaurant early and one of the staff was cleaning the glass door and windows. At least you know they clean haha.  We ordered gyoza that came with the combo and it came fairy quickly. The sauce had a hint of spice but I wouldn't say that it's spicy. I found that the amount of noodles was just a bit more than I could handle and that the soup was quite salty. The matcha cheesecake (+$3) that came with the combo was teeny tiny and didn't taste much of matcha."}
{"text":"All the hype, all the wait, all the stories from downtown and mid-town locations....what a letdown.  Some highs - the spicy pork Some ok - the original pork Total disappointment - the original chicken  If you like spicy, their spicy pork delivers.  Enjoyable but watch out that not only does the spice deliver a kick, the garlic overload keeps reminding you what you had for lunch.  Their original pork was ok.  Their broth was tasty but not a standout from other places.  Maybe the hype and expectation was a little high.  The original chicken was pretty underwhelming.  If you have been stuck on an airplane and wanted a noodle soup, the best they can offer you is a cup of mildly hot water in a Campbell's Hot and Hearty Chicken Noodle Soup.  Thought obviously not that bad, but there bowl reminded me of it.  From the yellow chickeny broth to the somewhat suprisingly pre-fab tasting noodle.  I'm no japanese ramen expert but as a Korean, I've had my fair share of Ramen and I did not enjoy their noodle.  Servers were great but service was slow on getting the food.  I think it was 25mins to get the bowls to the table.  When I entered, a guy left shaking his head and told me 40mins to served.  25 is better than 40 but that is a long time to wait for ramen.  Overall, I would recommend staying with their pork line of the menu.  Have not tried the Tapas or rice.  Just be careful if you are in a hurry.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"I've been to a number of ramen places I'm Toronto,  and this one bottoms the list.  While it carry the Kinton name,  the noodle,  soup,  and meat is sub par quality: the soup is warm at best, and VERY salty. The noodles seems like they we're overcooked,  and the meat lacks flavor.   On top of that, it was a 20 minute wait for order to being served: I'm not talking just the ramen,  but the edmame too!  20 minutes for edmame...  Never will I go back again."}
{"text":"Okay, fellow foodies do not get mad at me for what I am about to say. Prior to today I was stubborn and didn't like ramen just because I always thought of it as the packaged stuff and never opened up my palette to the real stuff.  I went to Kinton Ramen for my first bowl of real ramen ever and OMG where has this been my entire life?! I can't believe my stubbornness has prevented me from tasting one of the most amazing things in life -cries-  I was afraid it was going to be busy but there were a good amount of seats along the bar. The staff were very attentive and made sure to ask me right away what my order was when it looked like I was ready.  I got the Original Pork Miso Ramen that had soy bean paste, bean sprouts, scallions, corn, garlic oil, and pork, with thin noodles. I think my noodles arrived within 10 min or less. Wow, it was delicious. Pork was tender and slightly charred for added flavour, broth was seasoned well with just the right amount of salt, and the noodles were cooked perfectly. I think I did pretty well for my first bowl of real ramen.  Highly recommended and I will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"I'm not a big fan of ramen noodles, but this place has shown a whole new love for ramen! I'm definitely coming here once a month. I got a spicy jalapeño, and god damn....tasted like unicorns. Ramen"}
{"text":"I highly recommend the chicken karaage and getting extra pork belly for your ramen.  I don't mind the place but I am not a die-hard fan like a lot of people.  It's just ramen."}
{"text":"When you walk in you are greeted right away! Service is fast and the staff are friendly!  The food is amazing! Fresh and clean!"}
{"text":"We decided to come here for lunch and actually had to wait around 15-20 minutes before the restaurant even opened because we forgot to check that the opening time was 11:30 am lol! Needless to say, we were amongst the first to arrive and even so early in the morning they were already welcoming us with warm greetings. We ordered the combo, which included ramen and a choice of side. I thought it was a pretty good deal, since it was only $2 more for the side. The ramen was decent, I especially like the thin noodles it's the perfect size. I like semi-runny eggs so they made theirs just right for me. The broth could be a bit hotter though. I remembered it to be warm while I was drinking it. If you prefer it that way then you'll probably enjoy it more than me. Overall, this ramen place is decent but it doesn't keep me coming back for more."}
{"text":"Came here with my husband and 2 kids for lunch and I was so excited that they had opened a Kinton Ramen in the area! We usually have to travel to North York or downtown for any good ramen. This location is spacious, clean and simple. I liked the walls with this cool wooden design. It was however very loud, they were playing clubbing music at 12 noon....when I asked for a high chair, they had none. The menu is small, only some options for ramen, and some tapas. We ordered the miso chicken ramen and pork shoyu ramen. Ordered a chicken rice dish for my 2 year old. Each ramen was an expensive $12.99, and the toppings were extra (corn, veggies etc). It took them 20-30 min to prep it. The ramen was very tasty, broth was flavorful and the meat was very tender. The chicken rice dish was so so, rice was soft and fluffy but the chicken looked like canned chicken with a dollop of mayo on top and some nori.  The bill came up to almost $40 which is quite pricey. I thought the ramen was good but not worth the price. The ambience was great for the younger crowd and couples but not family friendly."}
{"text":"Coat hangar! They have it! (by the entrance) This is probably my favorite ramen place ever. Noodles chewy but not too chewy, perfect broth."}
{"text":"Definitely a current favorite for ramen in Montreal.  Waiting time - Of the times I've been here, I only waited once. On weekdays it seems reasonably easy to get a table within 5 minutes of arriving.  Food - After having tried multiple items on the menu, I definitely opt for the original ramen with pork broth and thin noodles. If you go for anything with fried chicken, I don't think the spicy one is as good as the original since they really cover it in too much sauce. The portions are also pretty large, don't expect to eat more than a bowl of ramen.   Service - Super fast. The last time I was there we got our food before water even came, probably less than 5 minutes after ordering. They are definitely polite as well.  Price - Reasonable. Expect less than 20 per head if you're only there for ramen, otherwise a little bit more."}
{"text":"I went to Kinton with coworkers when we had a site visit nearby. We got there just about 10 minutes before it opens for lunch and a nice line was forming down the walkway already.   When they eventually opened the door, we were all greeted with excited irrashaimase's and what not. Our group of 5 managed to snag the long table closest to the door..  it's nice to eat and have a conversation without getting surprised by random exclamations and outbursts behind me.   Everybody else ordered a bowl of ramen but I ordered the hot karaage, thinking back to my experiences at Sansotei. My friend got the cheese ramen and it came with a huge pile cheese shavings on top which he quickly mixed into his bowl to make his broth creamy.I tried some of the ramen off a friend's bowl and it seemed much less oily than Sansotei's. The pork belly didn't seem as melt-in-your-mouth and no egg served with each bowl. I'm told that the spicy garlic ramen is the one to try so that'll be on my radar for the next visit in the area. The karaage was good ... it came drizzled with hot sauce to give it a kick and was perfectly happy with it as a meal."}
