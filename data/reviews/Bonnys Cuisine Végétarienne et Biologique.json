{"text":"The competition is tough in Montréal, even for vegetarian restaurants. Bonnys isn't the best, but it is very good, and would probably get a five star rating from me in most other cities. If you're looking for vegetarian or vegan food that is more like comfort food, rather than raw bowls with tempeh, then Bonnys is one of the best options Montreal has, and well worth trying."}
{"text":"We walked in and the place looks cozy, the service staff was friendly but a little dismissive when we just asked for the menu.  She was serving someone else and instead of acknowledging the request she suggested she was too busy at that moment.  Seemed like I would have appreciated her just remembering that we wanted the menu and she could have just given it to us later.  She was only serving 4 tables, and kept bringing the others the food, without giving us time to read the menu.  We chose the boca burger, which was black beans in a semi patty served on a piece of bread, smothered with salsa and nachos with a salad.  The salad was fine, but nothing special.   The burger was bland and the nachos were store bought and from the tasteless salsa, I suspect that too was bought at the store.  All this went for the expensive price of $14.50.   We also ordered the special of the day, which was falafel sandwich rolled in a fajita, with salad and store bought plantain chips. Absolutely tasteless.  I also forget the tomato soup, quaintly served in a small coffee cup.  But that made it a miniature  portion!  This too came to $15.  So if this meal would have been less expensive, it would  have been considered fairly priced and it would have been bland but nourishing and good enough for a lunch.  But at that price I would have expected some effort and a least a nod to cooking for taste, I will say that it is a waste of money to go here.  All in all with taxes this meal came to $38, without the drinks.  I try so hard to cheer vegetarian food, and hesitated to write this review, but truthfully I feel gouged."}
{"text":"Wine is insanely expensive. We ordered two half carafes of the house wine, then a third when more friends joined us. Admittedly, we didn't ask the price, but we would never have guessed $28 for a half carafe of plonk. The waitress didn't even add two together for a slightly less expensive but still ridiculously priced carafe. The food is just okay but the experience left us feeling gouged. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Very good. I had the lentil burger, it was nice and crispy on the outside and soft and nicely spiced inside. It came with a side of plantain chips. My dining partner had the Bonny's special. Lots of salad and their homemade empanada which resembled a spanakopita in flavour. Service was great, the place is super cute. I think Montreal should have more places like this. I most definitely will come back more than once. Their menu is extensive but not intimidating. I wanted to try everything. They also have a liquor license with nice delicious fancy drinks. We had the sangria. Thumbs up, Bonny's!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has the BEST soups, and their chocolate pudding is delicious. They accomodate gluten free too, but it generally means substitution. For example, a boca burger comes with no bun, but with hummus instead.  It's a nice atmosphere, and the prices are good. The best part is that it's all organic. :-) Their menu is ok, but the special is usually very special."}
{"text":"We went to Bonny's in seek of what Montreal has to offer and we weren't disappointed.  The decor was different, sort of a cross between vibrant and cozy. I like how the one window opens up to over look the street traffic and the outdoors.  The service was rather slow. Considering how there wasn't too many people in the restaurant. The waitress was friendly enough although she kept forgetting to bring us a new jug of water after we asked a few times.   Was really looking forward to trying the empanadas, only to be told they were all out. So they substituted quesadillas in place of the empanadas for Bonny's Platter. Was also hoping to trying the numerous daily salads they had listed on their website, but only found 3 options at the restaurant. Nevertheless, the quinoa salad and the noodles salad were delicious.   Some of my quesadilla was a little burnt on one side. That is alright because the quesadilla still tastes delicious, very cheesy and it was flakey and crunchy like a pastry. The salsa was very fresh and light (could use a touch more salt but that's a personal preference) and complimented the tortilla chips nicely. There was a generous portion of house salad provided.   Overall, very decent portion size, tastes and looks fresh and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"I like Bonny's a lot. I always seem to order their house lasagna everytime I go. It's just so tasty. It's a quaint little spot, the staff is really kind and I've never left disappointed. Their burgers are also yummy and filling."}
{"text":"The food was great! I got the soup of the day, and a quinoa salad. Then I split a chocolate mousse with my boyfriend. Yum!"}
{"text":"Love this place.  The special of the day is usually great, and the soups are not to be missed.  I don't know how Bonny comes up with the flavouring but damn...the coconut lentil features in my dreams.  I love the chili.  Am a bigger fan of the lentil burger than the boca burger but both are good.  The bruschetta is awesome too.  And yummy carrot cake!"}
{"text":"I can honestly say that I think I would have done a better job in that kitchen if you grabbed me off the street, blindfolded me and threw me in there. The \"cook\" had no clue what they were doing, they need to choose another career path."}
{"text":"Overpriced. I mean the food was o.k but it is something I can make at home. The food took too long to get to my table.The staff acted weird with me.I am not going back.Very nice decor though."}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise! From the cosy decor to the delicious organic and vegetarian food...big thumbs up! The lentil burger was out of this world - the best vegetarian burger I've had in Montreal so far.  Really nice healthy flavours! The carrot cake was really tasty and did not last long... Gluten free options as well. The service was fine but could have been a little more smily.  It's a great little spot in griffin town - we need more organic and vegetarian restaurant like this one in Montreal! That's all you need to know."}
{"text":"Food sucks. We had the special. Took 1 hour to put some vegies on a plate and bring it out. Extremely overpriced. Not original at all. Aux Vivres or Panthere Verte in the plateau are much better options to try."}
{"text":"Fantastic food! Great service and nice ambience. Full of flavour and high quality food."}
{"text":"Perhaps my hopes for Bonnys were too high, perhaps I had my hopes set on a dish from an old menu, all I can say is this experience was a little \"meh\".   The plantain chips were from a bag, the tempeh ruben was bland and the service was pretty slow. My dining partners Boca Burger platter was quite good but I heard the server tell another customer they ran out right after we ordered.   They do get bonus points for an organic menu, organic wine selection and decent beer.   All in all, not worth special trip out of your way but if you're in the 'hood it's a fair option."}
{"text":"Bonny's is an amazing restaurant. I took my family there (mix of vegetarians and carnivores) and everyone loved it. The lentil soup is delicious. So is the tempeh wrap with sauerkraut and pickles. Definitely order the brownies with ice cream for dessert. The portion is enormous and the brownies come stacked in between delicious coconut ice cream. This restaurant rivals other veggie places in Montreal because the prices are very reasonable and the portions are good. The vibe is very funky, unpretentious and relaxed. Places like Bonny's are few and far between. We had the pleasure of going when Bonny was our server and the cook. She's the best. Go to this resto and you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Located in a neighborhood famous for the night life and restaurants this restaurant is a very good option if you are looking for vegan and delicious food. I tried lentil burger and I highly suggest it. Combination of flavor and spices makes the food very delicious and different. Salad was fresh and dressed nicely. Other players were also tempting and eye catching. The only problem with the food was rather small portions for some dishes they have on menu. The dessert was not as good as the main dish but it us different. Their service is slow which is normal for a restaurant run by two but for busy hours might be difficult to manage."}
{"text":"This is a great joint for veggies/vegans! Lots of options that are solid. The deluxe nachos was really good. The lentil burger was made of a flavorful party of veg + beans. It comes with pickles, onions and mustard on top for a taste that reminded me a McDonald's. Get the St-Ambrose Apricot Wheat Ale! So refreshing!"}
{"text":"The restaurant has a warm and friendly atmosphere, and the quality of the food was good to excellent.  However, the portions wee way too small for the amount of money paid.  For example, I ordered the Tempeh Reuben, and it consisted of two small halves with baked plantain chips and some shredded pickled carrots included.  There was only one waitress waiting tables, and she left me hanging for a while when I needed to pay my bill and get going."}
{"text":"Bonny is a gem and her wonderful resto is a credit to haute vegetarian cuisine in Montréal. Bonny takes it to a whole other level. She steps the veg game up like nobody's business. She is a master in her field and a proficient practitioner of her craft; yes, ladies and gents, Bonny is indeed, kicking it up a notch.   Make your evening here an event, an outing, please do make it a big to do. Put on some shiny duds and hightail it on over to Notre-Dame with your lover for a night on the town. Sit by the window, order a bottle of organic viticulture red wine, relax, enjoy your surroundings, peruse the extensive menu and ponder the beautiful choices. Ordering absolutely anything would be a superb life choice. You're gonna need to try all of the food here. I love the black bean burger but that is only the beginning."}
{"text":"Bonnys has been a live saver for me this summer. My husband and I are in the middle of renovating our house and we basically have to eat takeout every single night because we have no kitchen. I love pretty much everything I've tried at Bonnys so far.   The vegan quesadillas are simple but they really hit the spot. Normally I don't like Daiya cheese but somehow they make it work.   Spicy Tempeh salad is another favourite. It's a meal salad and pairs well with a daily soup.   Also the wraps are just fantastic. I've tried the hummus and tempeh and both are satisfying.   We talk a lot about how food makes us feel in the moment but what's great about Bonnys is how you feel afterwards... like a million bucks!"}
{"text":"One of my favourite vegetarian restaurants in Montreal.   The menu consists mostly of sandwiches, salads, and veggie burgers, but there are also some platters with larger portions. Every meal I've had here seems to be served with either tortilla chips or plantain chips. The food has always been fresh; I'd suggest the hummus sandwich. A negative is that sometimes they run out of certain salads or sandwich spreads-  so it might be a good idea to ask beforehand what they have ready.   The atmosphere is rustic and cozy; the best part is the tree branch room divider.  The servers have always been really friendly as well.  Good place to have a meal and chat with friends- with that said, expect a bit of a wait, the service can be a bit on the slow side."}
{"text":"Ditto to all the other reviews. It is a quaint place and cozy with yummy comforting, fresh and local food."}
{"text":"A cosy resto in the Sud-Ouest borough. Wicker and wood, and sober colours in their interior. They have many choices of beer and great vegan and vegetarian food of all striped. We had the reuben wraps with the daily soup. Their bruschetta is delicious, as is their house iced tea blend. Friendly and prompt bilingual service."}
{"text":"I was really happy with the food, the lasagna is full of flavor and the smoothies are perfectly refreshing. Bonnie is doing a good job considering the fact she's doing everything!"}
{"text":"I love the warm atmosphere and the selection of vegan options were very creative and delicious! The natural lemon water they serve at each table is definitely a nice touch.  I plan to be a regular at this place!"}
{"text":"I discovered this restaurant as I was walking around Griffintown and felt the need to stop by and try their food; I was very pleased by the tasty food and the atmosphere of the place. Although the service is a bit slow (there seemed to be only one cook and one waiter on duty that day), the veggie burger I tried was both unusual and excellent, a fun surprise. I will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Bonnys est un des rares restaurants complètement végétariens de Griffintown (si ce n'est le seul si je me fie à la liste de l'Association Végétarienne de Montréal!). Bien que les plats proposés, majoritairement de la comfort food, ne soient pas nécessairement originaux lorsqu'on compare le menu à d'autres endroits comme Lola Rosa, L'Gros Luxe 100% Végé, etc., il y en a pour tous les goûts ou presque: burger aux lentilles, lasagnes, plat du jour en fonction des produits disponibles en saison, etc. La nourriture est bonne mais sans plus (voire légèrement trop salée). Par contre, Bonnys se démarque par l'emphase mise sur la confection de plats maison, la présence d'ingrédients biologiques (plus de 90%!) et l'offre de grains entiers (incluant du pudding au riz brun!). D'ailleurs, les desserts végétaliens  sont excellents. Don't miss out on them! Vous apprécierez également la sympathie du personnel et, globalement, l'ambiance chaleureuse du restaurant. Je recommande si vous habitez dans le coin (ou êtes de passage dans le quartier). Belle option santé dans Griffintown! Mise à jour du 16 avril 2017: Le menu a récemment changé et il y a davantage d'emphase mise sur les options véganes. Les produits laitiers sont en option seulement. That's the way to go!"}
