{"text":"Don't sit at a table in the bar. Service was slow and not that friendly. Waited awhile for our order to be taken and for a drink refill. We liked our sandwiches, but fries were slightly undercooked. Prior experience was very good. Maybe this place is hit or miss?  Like that it is owned by local folks."}
{"text":"The food here reminds me of the book Fairenhieght 911. The food is hot hot and greasy and leaves coat of grease in your mouth. And the place smells of being burnt. I can only say been their once and that was enough."}
{"text":"OH yummmmmmmmmmmmmm. Nice place, great atmosphere, wonderful staff and outstanding food. The chicken tortilla soup is phenomenal. Everything I've ever had was at least good and at best amazing. Perch sandwich very good, burger as well. I always get the homemade chips instead of fries because they are so good and you can't get them everywhere. Often have the special which have always been really good, if you're lucky enough to go when they have chicken paprikash DO NOT pass it up it's outstanding!! Good choice of beers, great bartenders. Oh and the wings are really good too. Try anything on the menu or the special board --  you won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"Place was clean.  Burger was a frozen patty, that was disappointing.  During lunch is not the time to have people standing on the bar and taking down televisions.  Save that for when your guests are not eating or watching tv!"}
{"text":"Visited on a Friday night. It was fairly busy and had a great feel. Its a great neighborhood place, I just wish it was in my neighborhood!   The Wings were big and meaty. Fried to perfection. The crab cakes were the best we've had this Lenten season. Everything was great, the food, the service and clientele. Its our new \"Cheers!\" Just a place when you want to unwind."}
{"text":"We have been coming here for years.  We love the decor and the people.  Jeannie and Anthony are always great...very attentive and friendly.  We probably eat here often because the location is close to home and shopping.   The menu is mostly standard bar food, with some specials thrown in.  Nice crowd and always a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"Love this place,  it has recently become one of my favored restaurants in Aurora.  Their sandwiches are great,  I had the turkey pretzel club and it was one of the best club sandwiches I've had.   Only complaint was that service was a bit slow and seemed like I was forgotten about for a little while. Not the biggest issue for me because the food is incredible!"}
{"text":"Just a terrible place to go. Food is okay when you finally get it. Waitresses always rude. Managers no better. If you're lookin to take your family or friends out somewhere don't go here. It takes forever and it's far from service with a smile."}
{"text":"A friend wanted to take us to dinner and we chose Station 43 in Solon. It's nearby and I had heard good things about it on the radio. They also have outdoor seating, but we opted for the indoors.  The place was pretty hopping when we arrived and got the last table in the dining room area. If you like (or love) firehouse memorabilia, you'll love this place. There are pictures of fires and fireman, fire company patches from all over the country, fireman hats, uniforms and more. We had a life-size mannequin outfitted in complete gear perched on a ladder that was positioned horizontally above us. Very cool. Every time you looked around, you saw something you missed the last time you looked!  The food and service were also good. Our waitress came over multiple times to make sure everything was going well and cheerfully conversed with us.  I had the \"Gone Fishin'\", Panko breaded sole served on a toasted hoagie roll with a side of tartar sauce and coleslaw ($9). I opted for a side salad instead of the coleslaw and fries. There was a $2 up-charge, but I didn't mind. The Panko crust was nice and crispy, with the fish tender and juicy on the inside. The salad was fresh and refreshing on a hot day.  We were there on Italian night, with an Italian friend, who ordered the Italian special: Lou's Italian Sausage with Peppers and Onions (around $6) and Italian Wedding Soup  ($2.39). He said both were some of the best he's ever had.  The other party in our group had the Beer Battered Yellow Lake Perch ($14.49) with tartar sauce and a decent sized side of french fries and coleslaw. A little more pricey than some other fish fries, but it was well worth it.   Overall we had a nice experience and I would go there again. There were no leftovers, so that speaks for itself."}
{"text":"This place had amazing food for years but the last few years the quality of food has gone down. The last few times we have gone, the taste and appearance of meals resembled cafeteria style food down to my mashed potatoes coming in an ice cream scooper forum. The kids love going there because of the fireman decor however if it wasn't for the kids wanting to eat at the fireman restaurant we would never go back. You're always safe with a salad. I have to admit they use to have the best chicken breast dinner but now it is a frozen chicken breast that is absolutely disgusting. The vegetables were a cheap frozen kind that almost had a fish smell to it. I miss the quality food that they used to have."}
{"text":"I've driven past this place a bunch and decided to finally try it. although it was slightly drizzled. the weather was nice but outside seating was advised a NO. second we were seated ridiculously close to the next table next to us. finally after seating the next issue was no drink menu. ordered wings and then realized they charge you for ranch! I've never been anywhere where you get charged for ranch. my gf ordered a wrap and got ranch free, but here you order wings and its 1.99 for a small cup. after all of that the wings were bland. the concept of the restaurant is nice, but my first impression was a bad experience."}
{"text":"We were visiting family in the area and had a lunch there.  The food was better than average bar food.  The corn dog on the menu sounded good but I wasn't sure it would be enough food.  It was huge and really good tasting.  Maybe the best corn dog I've ever eaten.  And the chips were very good chips.  Tried one of the wings and it was excellent also.  Wife had hot sausage and said it was very good.  The server seemed to be struggling to be polite; maybe a bad day or just not suited for the work.  Certainly a place to which we would return if we were in the area."}
{"text":"It is hard to believe that anyone could screw up something as simple as fried breaded fish especially lake Erie yellow perch. But the clowns in the kitchen of this joint did it and royally. The three fair sized fillets were overcooked by half or more. The breading was hard, not crisp as one would expect and totally overpowered the usually sweet delicate perch flavor. On top of that the accompanying french fries were soggy  and more than likely frozen. The dab of Cole slaw was OK, but just OK. All in all a disappointment. There is no way a bunch of firefighters would tolerate this in any firehouse kitchen, the cook would have been skinned alive."}
{"text":"Love it great environment. I really like the theme there going with its different food was fantastic a definite recommendation from me and my family"}
{"text":"Ordered a fish dinner with sweet potato fries...it was terrible!  If I had been at the restaurant I would have sent it back to the kitchen. There were 3 small pieces of perch, a small amount of droopy fries (which were yucky, I threw them out) and a small 1/4 c of slaw...all of this for $18! Sorry guys, even McDonald's fish sandwich is tastier."}
{"text":"Busy place with average food and below average wait staff.  You know when you walk into a new place you've never been and the first thing you encounter is the waitress who looks like she is being tortured just to give you a menu.  Then she disappears, never to return, so I ask another waitress a few questions on the menu.  My order took 20 minutes, average at best.  I was disappointed because I had heard good things about this place.  Will not be back."}
{"text":"There are not many non-chain options in Solon, and Station 43 had decent reviews.  I stopped in for dinner around 7PM on a Wednesday evening, and the place was a zoo.  It is split down the middle between seating & bar.  I grabbed the only available 2 top in the bar area, but after waiting for 10 minutes with not one person asking me for a drink, I quickly snagged a bar seat that opened up.  Even then it took the bartender, Frank, awhile to get to me.  I kinda had the feeling that if you aren't a local you are 2nd class.  I wasn't in any hurry, and they have Keno so I wasn't too upset with the service.  The menu has a ton of options from bar foods to standard dishes.  I started with 6 wings and the firehouse hot sauce.  The wings were dry lacking sauce.  I ordered the Station 43 burger for my entree w/ sweet potato fries... nothing special.  The best part about Station 43 are the friendly locals who will strike up convo with anyone sitting at the bar... they definitely made it more enjoyable."}
{"text":"I have only been there for lunch once but the experience was a good one.  My only complaint was they were out of bacon after just literally opening.  That is inexcusable when your signature burger's main component is bacon.  After the bacon incident I switched to the Charlie Boy burger and it was delicious... The fries were good and the cole slaw was good as well.  I will be back, hopefully by then someone will have run to Walmart for more bacon."}
{"text":"I have been eating here monthly for two years.  Tonight might be the last time we go there for dinner.  Have good friends in from AZ. Party of 8, we wait for 15 minutes to be seated.  There are two tables open that would accommodate our party.  We are told we cannot put the tables together because they are two different servers.  I was really....... You are more worried about your servers than your customer.  Go 2 minutes down the street and get better food at a better price at Ruby Tuesday."}
{"text":"This is a fun place to eat.  The nostalgic decorations really mean a lot if you're familiar with the Solon/Twinsburg/Aurora area.    The \"Adult Grilled Cheese\" rocks.  It reminds me of a grilled cheese I used to get all the time in the break room when I worked for Disney.  It always lifted my spirits on those long days.  Kids menu.  They even got fireman hats!  The staff was polite.  We will definitely visit again."}
{"text":"The food here was great and the service was excellent. I got a salad and the margherita pizza. The salad was delicious and so was the pizza but the pizza was smaller than expected. But this is still a great place to eat and our server was very friendly."}
{"text":"We are having a birthday party there tonight! Great experience with Zack the waiter!!"}
{"text":"Just okay. I'm just never impressed with this place. I keep trying and keep getting a blah meal. I want to like it but not impressed. Think prices are high for what you get. Think the portions are small. Staff so-so. I think I'm officially done trying to talk myself into liking it."}
{"text":"Great food great atmosphere.  It is our third time here for lunch, one of these days we need to make it out for breakfast!  Typically we take the puppies into Banfield at Petsmart monthly for \"butts and nails\". Lol.  This is our stop for lunch on those days.  We've tried a few other local watering holes but typically come back to Station.  Good honest home Made food, nice selection to wet our whistle and cool deform- all historical to Firefighting back to the 1900."}
{"text":"Been there twice (always like to try a place twice before rating them).  Food and service has been great.  Love all the choices on the menu.   The bar section can get a little loud if you have young kids but beside that, we are a fan of this place."}
{"text":"food has improved recently BUT service is SLOW and ALWAYS pesky flies - gross.  Its hit or miss."}
{"text":"In the mood for some good ol American comfort/Tavern food?  This place hits the mark dead on.    The atmosphere is cozy.  Decorated with lots of vintage firefighting gear, and pictures from the areas early firefighters, there is a lot to look at making the conversation easy and the wait for your food seem to fly.  For the most part the room is well divided, giving the sense of semi-privacy.  I won't comment on the bar selection here, as half of the establishment is a bar.  We were drinking the last bit of the Christmas Ale, but I am certain (based on lack of open seats at the ample bar) that you could find the drink you are looking for at a great price.  Appetizers started with buffalo wings and calamari.  Both of these were knocked out of the park.  We finished every bit of the appetizers and now I couldn't wait for my bacon cheeseburger to make its way to the table.  It did not let me down.  Perfectly cooked (medium rare isn't easy to get just right) juicy and full of flavor.  The fries were also done just right.  After eating way more than I should have, I finished up, and the wife and I ordered a nightcap to enjoy the atmosphere.  While finishing our drinks, the woman next to me (obviously out on a first/second date) choked on her wine and spit it all over me and her date.  She didn't acknowledge that she did this, probably to try and save face, so I played it in stride and quietly dried my face and shirt and we left.  We had a good laugh about it on the way out to the car...I hope the rest of the date went a little better for that lady!"}
{"text":"The Station burger was very good. I ordered it medium & it was more like well done so keep that in mind when ordering burgers.  My fiancé got a plain burger with bacon & he really enjoyed it with the homemade chips.  My mom got the roast beef sandwich & did not care for it. It's not deli roast beef, but real roast beef, which she wanted. It just did not taste good. She had the home fries with peppers & onions & really enjoyed them.  My cousin enjoyed her chili.  The only problem was it took a really long time to get our meal. There were three other tables at the same time. One was a big table and I understand that. What was frustrating was we had to beg for drinks & were not given an update on our food. We also were on our way back to PA & didn't really want to wait that long for food."}
{"text":"Atmosphere: 4/5, This is a low key bar on the side of the highway.  It's decked out with firefighter gear and photos. There are plenty of tables and bar seating and the noise level remains low enough to carry a comfortable conversation.  Service: 5/5, The bartenders are experienced and make great suggestions. They know the menu and can explain wing sauces, soups, and draft lists without having to check or ask anyone. They are attentive and responsive. To top off the service, they don't force you to close out or push you out the door at closing. They let you finish your drinks and mosey toward the door.  Menu: 4/5, There are plenty of options from typical bar appetizers to dinner entrees. We had the chips and salsa and our friend had the ribs and wings combo. The wings were juicy and flavorful, the ribs were smothered in BBQ sauce and not dry, ad the fries were nice hot straight out of the fryer (not from under a heat lamp). Drink choices were ample and varied. I asked the bartender for something with rum mixed in. He didn't hesitate and the drink was well prepared with no shortage of rum. The only thing keeping this from getting a 5th star is that I would have liked to see a special appetizer or drink that ties into the theme. Some of the names of items were firefighter related but having something unique would have been the polished finish.  Overall: 4/5, We will come back almost every time we're back in town. We were here on a Sunday night and the quality/service was still top tier."}
{"text":"Nice friendly neighborhood bar. Beers is always cold and diverse. Something new all the time."}
{"text":"It is certainly decent food but quite a bit overpriced in my opinion.  I expected some wow factor from all the local chatter and was just left with a huge \"Meh\"."}
{"text":"We love this place - it's a great local place (we go there 1+ times a week) but it's worth a trip to explore if you're looking for a new place with interesting decor, good food, good beers (esp. on tap) and a fun staff.  The floorplan is split between restaurant and bar; I'd suggest having dinner at the bar to enjoy the fun.  The steak bites appetizer is excellent - the potato skins also.  Any / every burger is a good choice - the pizzas are sized for 1 or 2 to share - the wings are great - they usually have daily specials that are really good as well (especially the soups).  The fish dinner is really good also.  We've never had a bad meal here; the food is consistently great."}
{"text":"This place has got great burgers and a decent beer list. There isn't much that I can say other than that, the service is average, the ambiance is average, the location isn't particularly convenient for me because I don't live in the Eastern Suburbs. But if I'm out there again I'd definitely drop in for a beer and a burger."}
{"text":"They have a phenomenal buffalo chicken sandwich, they call it the Firehouse Chicken. Food is always good, service is friendly. The fire station decor is a great touch."}
{"text":"During our visit to Ohio, we saw this place with lots of cars in the parking lot.  Figured it must be good...and it was. Wings were spicy but not too hot, very crispy.  Steak salad was delicious but the steak was a little chewy.  Staff were friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Left before I could try food or hang out because of lack of service/communication with customers. Very disappointing. Party of three called ahead at least an hour before we showed because we were interested in watching a game on tv. Told us they had it and to just ask to switch channel once we showed. We showed up and were greeted with seemingly friendly hostess. They (both hostesses) said we'd be on 20min wait list- which is fine- except they would not switch the channel of ONE of MANY TVs at the bar to watch while we wait. We waited a bit (missing beginning of game). Then we asked again and reminded we called ahead. We waited another ten min for them to get the remote... They found the remote and they didn't even have the correct game like they told us on the phone. Why."}
{"text":"Ate in once, service was less than good.  More recently... Thought try again for St P Day and got two Reubens... Super excited until get home and we had no cheese, no sauerkraut, no thousand island  (20 minute drive later in the evening after waiting all day for this sandwich)  - I was so mad I cried!! I called and the manager said he would discount the bill, we paid on a credit card. Still paid full price for a meal that was missing all the main ingredients!! Not sure if I care to try again here."}
{"text":"My family has eaten here several times and we are always pleased with our meals. They have awesome chicken fingers. I love all they do for the kids. Crayons and everything at the table plus each child gets a firefighter helmet if you ask about them. Great food, great prices and wonderful service."}
{"text":"This is a great place in the neighborhood for good-old-fashioned American pub fare or as the name implies, \"Firehouse Food\". I have tried the wings and they are definitely crispy. The ribs are tender enough to not need a knife. The fries are cut thick, crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside. I can't wait to try other things. I do not drink anymore, but if I did, I'd take advantage of the bar as a great place to just chill and hang loose after work. Either way, there is a separate section meant for sit-down meals. This is a local business and a one-of-a-kind pub that has it's own character and energy."}
{"text":"We just moved to the area and had lunch last Sunday.  Overall it was a great experience.  Love the atmosphere and it was very kid friendly.  The food was outstanding.  My husband got their double burger and I got the Rueben.  We ended up splitting the sandwiches so we could try both and they were awesome!  The couple next to us got wings and they looked awesome and they said they were some of the best they've had.  Service was super friendly and attentive.  Probably the best overall restaurant experience we've had in a long time."}
{"text":"A great greasy spoon that makes all the usuals with extra love. Their hotdog is nice, juicy, and covered with a savory chili. The sweet potato fries pass the crisp test. The clams are the large favorable varriety. It has that local tavern feel with good food to make it feel like home."}
{"text":"Food was great!  It took a while for it to come out but it was worth it!   We shared the Philly cheesesteak and Solon grande burger."}
{"text":"Service is always excellent.  The wedge salad ( ask for blue cheese dressing) with the steak tips or the salmon is amazing!  On Saturdays they have a burger called the smash burger, which is excellent as well!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times...food ALWAYS good...service VERY friendly...great little local joint ! We'll be baaaaaack !!  ;)"}
{"text":"Stopped here tonight for grilled wings. Menu said they do not offer grilled wings on Friday and Saturday.  However, they were not busy so they could accommodate my request. I asked for them to mix the sauces- hot and teriyaki- YUM.  In Florida, every wing place had grilled wings. I think the trick is to grill them then toss them in the fryer for 30 seconds or so to get them crispy. The regular clients at the bar were a bit on the tipsy side and had to be shushed a couple of times as the talk of politics, etc was loud and annoying. Bill was $49 for 2 wines, 3 large beers, a shot,  6 wings and a yummy burger.  The burger was fabulous."}
{"text":"Three weeks ago I had the juiciest, most tender, most delicious burger of my life at this establishment. It was beautiful, a huge, tender burger perfectly seasoned with 1/2\" bleu cheese and then swiss cheese, a thick slice of onion and tomato and a soft, almost buttery bun. Hello, my love! On the side were some sweet potato fries, not at all crispy (but I like them that way). I wondered why I didn't eat more burgers! Every bite was delicious! I had dreams about it that night!  Last week (no longer able to restrain myself!) I went back and ordered the same burger. This time there is just a smidgen of bleu cheese, no swiss, no tomato, no onion. They brought the wrong fries until I asked them to switch them out. It was also cooked well done, and just didn't have the same flavor and juicy deliciousness. Sigh.   Still, I am giving this place 4 stars, for the hope and promise that it could be so good again! The servers are decent. The decor is really interesting, lots of firefighting memorabilia and pictures, even a real wooden ladder and gear. The inside is a warm red, and they just added a new bar and a deck. The menu has alot of interesting options (really want to try the chicken parmesean, mussels, and fish fry) and I love that you can get sweet potato fries.  My friend ordered a salad and it was huge, with a pound of chicken on top and a homemade zinfindel dressing. Yum yum. The kitchen seems a little slow, which is fine if you get a masterpiece burger and not so hot when you hit the mediocre. But I'll reserve judgement until I visit again."}
{"text":"Been driving past this place for years. Had a coupon for buy 1 lunch, get one free.   Decor is pretty cool, all Firemen stuff.   Service was quick and friendly.   I ordered the Cornbeef Rubin. Hard to mess up, it was good.   Wife ordered the perch fish. 2 peices of fried perch, big bun, she said it was pretty good. French fries good.   All in all, bill was $26 for two sandwiches and 1 Coke less our coupon plus tip. $25 with tip and coupon. Not bad food wise, just not impressed enough on what we tried to go back for anything specific.   Think we May try their wing night special."}
{"text":"Station 43 is a cool roadhouse style tavern on Aurora Road near where Geauga Lake used to be.  The outside is nothing special, but the inside is cool with a dining room on one side and a bar room on the other.  The decor is centered around old firehouse pieces which gives the place a welcoming warm feeling.  Service is good and friendly with a nice staff.  The menu is pretty much the usual assortment of burgers, sandwiches, pizzas and other items.  I started with the sauteed shrimp app, which was 5 good sized shrimp nicely cooked and dusted with a spice rub and a butter dipping sauce.  A bit different then I would have thought for sauteed shrimp, but tasty and a good start to the meal.  For dinner I had the Perch Sandwich, two large breaded perch fillets on a good bun with lettuce and tomato.  The fish was ok, but the breading was a bit too thick so it overwhelmed the fish a bit.  The coleslaw and tarter sauce were both about what you would expect, just fine, but nothing to write home about (or really give much of a mention in a Yelp review).  The highlight of the dinner was the large portion of sweet potato fries, crisp on the outside, wonderfully sweet and just the right amount of starchy on the inside, I would highly recommend them especially as they are a free option instead of regular fries.  Station 43 serves good food in large portions in a cozy atmosphere, the flavors are good, but generally nothing too challenging or exciting.  A good place to stop in for a nice meal."}
{"text":"Food is mediocre at best. It is a bar after all, I realize that. However there are so many places with better food around here. Worse than that is the attitude of the bar staff. Never friendly, they always act like you're bothering them. I could deal with mediocre food, however the staff needs to make people WANT to come back!! Or they won't........"}
{"text":"My service was wonderful for a to-go service. I had two orders of the decision maker appetizer and it was yummy. I just moved into the area and saw that Station 43 wasn't to far from me so why not give it a shot? My appetizers were not burnt so I was able enjoy my munchie food we got. Some places are a hit or miss with fried food and I enjoyed my meal from here. I will be back for lunch/dinner in person and hope to become a regular!"}
{"text":"Wanted to really like this place but didn't happen! Family and I went on a Sunday evening. Casual dining, nice staff and pretty clean. Love the firefighter theme!!! However; the soda was flat, the wings were fatty and food not that good. My nephew didn't like the chicken wrap and my son said the pork chops had no flavor. Wife and I both had ribs and we both like them! Had an order of regular and sweet potato fries, they were soggy and greasy. Service messed up the order (but fixed it) and didn't refill the drinks.  I think this place is better for burgers and beers at the bar. I wouldn't take the family to dinner there again. I will go back with a buddy to watch a game."}
{"text":"Party of two on 12/31/2016.  Ordered the corn beef sandwiches and wings - the sandwiches were ok.  Meat was pushed toward the center of the sandwich so it looked really really piled high.  The 1/4 inch ends of the sandwiches had no meat unless you moved your meat around.  Garlic Parmesan wings - meat was tender and well cooked - but the sauce was nothing to write home about.  Had a spice to them, but you didn't smell the garlic - cheese was not there that we could see.  Mandarin Orange Sesame wings - sauce was tame - like a sweet and sour but very little flavor - would have liked a squeeze of oranges or something to add a positive taste.  Would go again if nothing else was opened and we were hungry.  TV's in restaurant.  Decorations and theme was excellent.  Service was great."}
{"text":"It's a quaint place, and would go there for a few drinks and appetizers, but I won't go for dinner again. The entrees weren't all that great, and the felt like they were frozen/prepackaged food that was \"prepared\", The Buffalo Chicken sandwich is a prime example.. the breading came off like it does on Chicken McNugget.   Service was good and everyone was very nice..."}
{"text":"We have been here several times with excellent results buy last night was not their night to shine.  My done ordered the penne with meat sauce and the pasta was so over cooked that it melted in your mouth and the sauce was very bland.  I ordered the chicken parmigiana sandwich and the sauce, again, was very bland.  Now my husbands patty melt was amazing.  The burger had a nice crust on it and it was delicious.  They really need to improve their pasta sauce."}
{"text":"For the price it is not very impressive. My son and I ate there. I had the grilled chicken with broccoli and a salad. The salad was terrible all wilted and looked like it had been sitting in the refrigerator for hours. The chicken was grilled not marinated at all with no seasonings and really had no flavor. On the upside it was a quality piece of chicken just no flavor. My son had barbecued ribs and they were all burnt on the bottom with no sauce hardly on them. They were all dried out.He also had sweet potato fries which were good thank goodness. I had a cosmopolitan to drink and it was just okay. I had it served up and there was still ice in it. Overall we were very disappointed and would not recommend going there. The waiter we had was not that good either he acted like he could care less about us being there. There are  much better options out there  for the same kind of food."}
{"text":"After years of driving by this local tavern, we decided to give it a try for a casual dinner. The vibe is very relaxed and casual with friendly greetings from the hostess and our server. The Station Burger we ordered was just as we expected: good quality beef cooked just right and loaded with fresh toppings. Don't usually eat a half-pound burger, but this one was so good, I ate the whole thing! Needless to say there was not room for dessert:) This is a great place to meet friends after work or just hang out. And yes, it is family friendly during the day and into early evening!"}
{"text":"the best Angus burger in town!  This is a friendly local restaurant for the casual crowd interested in a casual meal.  My fav place for a quick bite to eat after a day of shopping!  Well done!"}
{"text":"Nice little spot to have a good burger. Pulled pork is yummy, burgers are great. Friendly staff. Solid place."}
{"text":"Was hard to get waited  on pulled pork full of fat  Waitress seen half pulled pork left never asked if any thing wrong tasted left over Burger semi cold when arrived Like the fact that they put lettuce on top and bottom of burger to to make it look thicker I got the 4 alarm lettuce not burger Still eating asked if I was done if I wanted a box Took forever to get food Had to wait for table no problem Problem is the waiting area is the size of a closet with 4 chairs in the enterence area. People running into you entering and leaving Asked for box for left over chips had to eat some to get in box One star is a gift would not go back"}
{"text":"I came across this place while out on an afternoon ride.  Great atmosphere, as you will gather from their name and other reviews this place is fire fighter themed.  Just had a sandwich, and it was superb.  I would suggest you ask for the house hot sauce, it was the perfect kind of spicy.  There is outside dining with a view of some woods.  Another nice thing, they have dedicated motorcycle parking.  Definitely casual atmosphere, but no WI-FI."}
{"text":"Nice place with a cool atmosphere.  Good size menu selection with many reasonably priced options.  The Lake Erie Yellow Perch was very tasty! A nice place to go for something different."}
{"text":"This was our first time and last.  Ordered the wedding soup for starters.  It was served barely warm and I am being kind by saying that.  I ordered the firehouse chicken sandwich.  The bun it was served on resembled a hockey puck.  Burnt black and  harder than a rock.  Chicken was all breading   No one came back to our table to ask how is the meal or do we need anything else.  The busboy came and asked  are you done and took my plate away.  I told him the problems how the food was coming out of the kitchen, still no one came over.  We asked for a check and just left.   Very disappointed and the entire dining experience was bad.  Would never go back!!!!!"}
{"text":"Never been here, can't figure out how to delete. Meant to post something for a different restaurant"}
{"text":"Food and staff have always been quite pleasant. I like the variety on the menu.  Crispy wings just the way I like them."}
{"text":"Decided on stopping in after an afternoon shopping locally.  Passed it many times and the place always seemed to have some nice cars in the lot.  Décor was O.K.  Food was O.K.  But that's all I can say.  The place was O.K.  Not disgusting.  Just O.K."}
{"text":"The service was fantastic and that Lake Erie yellow perch was phenomenal. I would drive from St. Louis to Ohio every month to eat that delicious fish! My dad said it was the best fried shrimp he's had in years."}
{"text":"Burgers are so tasty. Too bad the service sucks.  We've gone 4 times and really enjoyed the food but all 4 times the service sucked. I think we're done with this place"}
{"text":"We went here with a Our Town coupon and had a very nice dinner. My husband had the Chicken Parmesan (he loved it) I had 3 dozen mussels (Monday night special) and they were good. The mussels were cooked in butter and spices. I liked the toast on the side as well.  We are going back again this week for the mussel special (I can't get enough mussels!)"}
{"text":"After trying this place for second time recently I have the same feeling of not going back.  I had a pretty good burger both occasions, as well as horribly slow service both times. My wife was not satisfied with either of her meals, as they seemed to be left under a heat lamp for a while.  I will keep my options open, but will try to avoid station 43."}
{"text":"I was happily surprised by this place. We were looking for a bite to eat and this place went above and beyond with options and taste. Very good!"}
{"text":"We go here often as its our go - to place whenever we are out shopping. We have never had a bad meal. Service is good - fast and friendly. Sunday's are $2 pints and they have Guinness on draft. Can't beat that! The wings are great and one of my favorites. The Rueben is also a winner in my book!"}
{"text":"I am so obsessed with this place. Its just the best, laid-back place to get good food and drinks.   They have specials for all the holidays which is nice too. Stuff like chicken paprikash that you wouldn't find as easily at other restaurants. Or specialty breakfast items for days like St. Patty's and Easter.   I've gotten the pulled pork sandwich every time I've been here because it's just so darn good. They give you MORE than enough. Also, you can substitute french fries for sweet potato fries for free.... I don't know anywhere else that you can do that.  My boyfriend has gotten the Reuben here as well as other items such as the chicken wrap. Every time he says it's good. He's a Reuben expert so when he says it's good, I know it's true.   Price wise you get what you pay for. It's always worth it. And the service is always great. Me, my boyfriend, and whole family love coming here whether it's for breakfast, lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"A great spot for a casual meal, I had the hot wings. The wings are great buffalo style with the standard sauce offerings. The hot is not very hot, probably a medium compared to the other wing joints. Their home made chips are fantastic, others in my party had spaghetti which was well received. Sweet potato fries were good. Service here is always friendly and quick as you need it. Overall a good spot for quick roadhouse style dining in Aurora."}
{"text":"Another stop on my birthday weekend- and it was delightful! Great service and portions- I had the Turkey ruben- could barley bite into this ultra thick sandwich- side of sweet potato fries- really good! If you went in it's early years- give it another try- great local spot."}
{"text":"Just average. More options then just the normal bar food, so thats a plus. We got the breaded porkchops, ive had better but whos meal they were liked them. I got the chili which was the best thing we got and the grilled wings. Bbq ones were better than the cajun but not all that the waitress hyped them up to be.  Nothing to exciting or to bad. Like I said just average. There is a seperate dining room from the bar if wanted to bring family or kids."}
{"text":"My wife and I stop here on a regular basis for snacks and beer after playing golf.  The staff is always friendly and the food is good. I'd recommend them for causal dining and/or watching a game.  Good place."}
{"text":"Went there once on a Friday. First problem not enough places to eat in Solon especially in this area. We waited 45 min for table. Nicely decorated with firehouse theme. Food was average burger food. Server was slow. I hate to rate a restaurant based on server issues. That can always change.  Took along time to get food. Probably won't try again. Far from house. Nothing really left me feeling like I'd like to have that again. Not terrible, just too typical."}
{"text":"I always forget about this place, but whenever I remember it never disappoints. The food here is great. The vintage fire fighter things are really cool and creative. Not too expensive. A little cozy for how big it looks on the outside. And it has a strange conservative atmosphere to it. Beware ;)"}
{"text":"This place must be the only restaurant in Ohio that has good service. The firehouse beer is excellent! If I has to pick a special of theirs it would be the burgers and the homemade chips. I'd recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Boom.  Took care of our party of 8. All requested. All demands met. Boom.   Perfect again. Food great."}
{"text":"So I went here after having my cousin's fiance hear a review on it and I knew not to get all that excited since I know it would be Tavern type food and generally I can do without that type of cuisine unless I'm in the mood for some artery clogging goodness.  The place was relatively small but well decorated with pictures of area firehouses, fighters, and engines.  There for whatever reason was only one waitress for all the tables which was unacceptable especially once the place filled up right around noon.  I had ordered the firehouse chicken sandwich which was a breaded chicken sandwich with hot sauce.  It came out lukewarm and with a puddle of the hot sauce on top.  Bleh.  I ate it cause I was hungry more than because I enjoyed it but was able to sample the food of the others I went with.  The chips they make are homemade and excellent, not too salty, nice and crispy, was a big fan.  The french fries were decent nothing special, but they also have sweet potatoe fries which were very tasty.  The other meal I had a taste of was the fried perch dinner.  That was excellent and I would definitely go back for the fish fry.  It was nice and crispy breading with nice portion of fish.  I believe on Wednesdays they have an all you can eat fish fry for somewhere around $10.  So while my meal wasn't all that great at all, there is hope for tastier things on the menu.  If I went back I'd try the fish and hopefully go with someone that would try perhaps the burgers as the waitress recommended them however the menu overall didn't impress me.  But take a look on their website and see for yourself."}
{"text":"The food is good and well priced. However bring your iPad to watch some Netflix while your waiting 10 minutes for your server to even acknowledge your presence, could be long because they never even acknowledged we were there and we left."}
