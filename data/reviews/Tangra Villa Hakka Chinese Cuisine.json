{"text":"Quick and tasty take out option. Generous lunch portion for a reasonable price. I tried the Chili Chicken and Crispy Ginger Beef. Both were quite delicious but the beef was a little chewy. Would order from here again."}
{"text":"Great food and great price.Large portions. The staff take pride in their food and establishment. no dining area so its takeout only. Closed mondays.  i had mixup order with phone but was a new person and didnt confirm details before hanging up so i'll let that slide."}
{"text":"The only delicious food item at this take out is tangra villa chicken. Noodles is good enough. I don't like any of their fried rice items. I go here only because it's close by. Service is fast but I have no idea why they expect you to pay tip when they pass you the billing machine for a take out!"}
{"text":"The food was good, and huge portions.  Recommend the chili paneer schezwen style.  It comes with rice.  I didn't like the hot sour soup.  Food here could feed an army, Comfort food, not sure about hakka."}
{"text":"Tangra Villa is outstanding. The place is a bit hidden in the plaza but foods awesome and delicious. Would definitely be back for more. Price is right and quantity is good."}
{"text":"good food and good service! Only take-out available, call ahead first for quick pick up.  And it's hidden in a small plaza right on McCowan road and Manhattan road."}
{"text":"The tastiest Hakka Chinese food I've tasted in Canada. And their quality and quantity has been consistent for many years now. Only take out. Busy place but very efficiently run by some very pleasant people. Try their crispy ginger beef and Tangra villa specials. Food is always fresh and with generous portions of meat or seafood. Veggies are always done just right. Worth a try and definitely worth going back for more."}
{"text":"Most of the complaints about this place seem to be about the lunch rush/specials which I've never encountered as I'm usually there to pick up dinner in the evening and for me it's perfect.  Their pakora are awesome.  The tangra chicken is seasoned the same way as the pakora and equally delicious.  Their chilli chicken isn't anything to write home about though.  The crispy beef is a better and tasty substitute.  People at the counter have always been nothing but kind and courteous to me and other members of my family that frequent this for pretty regular weekend takeout."}
{"text":"Just tried the Manchurian Chicken and the Hakka Noodles lunch special at Tangra Villa and I have to say both were very tasty and great value for your money.  Lunch specials include a pop for $5.25!  You can't beat that.  We'll be back to try other items on the menu!"}
{"text":"Th service is really good and the owners are awesome. Very friendly and seems like a family run establishment.   I thought the food was mediocre though not as good as federicks in Markham but maybe I ordered the wrong thing.   Will give it another try. Not bad if you're in the area for lunch looking for cheap eats. The $10 lunch special is well worth the money."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch and the place was filled with students and such a small place.  NO PLACE TO EAT?  WHY DON'T PEOPLE MENTION THAT????  NO DINING - ONLY TAKE OUT!!!  Ordered the chili chicken lunch special - man it should've costed $2.00!  The dish tasted very oily and NOT FLAVOUR!  JUST OIL AND CHILI'S?!?!  Sorry, that's not what Hakka is all about.  Aweful food and the owner didn't even try to make room or did NOT even try to control the kids for us adult clients who'd spend WAY more money than any student with.  Yeah, thanks lady!  Suggestion, if you like Hakka food, DON'T GO HERE! Suggest, Tangerine or Super Hakka. If you like oily tasteless food with chili's on rice, then this is the place for you!  Now I know why there's only take out - owner's don't care to take accountability for their food.  BEWARE!"}
{"text":"I go here quite often when I'm in markham, it's great for take out hakka. I usually get the chicken pakoras, Singapore noodles, and tangra villa chicken. The chicken pakoras are fairly spicy and have a good amount of chicken per pakora. They give you quite a bit of Singapore noodles and it has a good curry flavour that isn't very overpowering. Finally the tangra villa chicken is nice and crispy and the saut√©ed onions are really tasty with it.  I sometimes also get the chili chicken or one of the beef orders, and they are really good too. They do no msg if you ask for it, and all the staff is very friendly.   Definitely one of my favourite hakka places... This and fedricks. :)"}
{"text":"Had it a few times, was good until about 2 weeks ago in a Friday at about 8pm.. I guess the cook was in a bad mood...chilli chicken and fried rice dinner meal..basically the lunch special and add an extra two bucks.  After the first 2-3 spoons I noticed the huge chunks of chicken, decided by looking at the pieces I would rather throw away the meal than risk getting sick- but I guess I was 2-3 spoonfuls to late. Will not be going back, 1* because I can't give a zero"}
{"text":"good for the lunch price but that's pretty much it. this is a place for high school students to eat who don't know what real hakka food is and just need a big portion of something cheap to fill up on. it's filled with kids at lunch and there's no place to eat. on other days theres this fat white girl that is the RUDEST person I have ever dealt with. heard of her before because she was rude to my friends father just because he couldn't hear what she was muttering but experienced her for myself and wanted to punch her across the face. the weirdest part was that with the lunch combo you get a free canned drink but when i asked for nestea they said it's an extra 50 cents. 50 cents is nothing but i just didn't understand why a canned nestea was an extra 50 cents. this place is weird and the food is mostly oil"}
{"text":"Good local take out place run by nice family.   Call ahead and pick up in 15 minutes is a good plus.   Haven't had any issues and gives competition to the many Asian places in Markham."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. I love Hakka food and especially chili chicken. This just didn't cut it. I ordered chili chicken with veggie chow mein and fried rice. The chili chicken is full of fat and doesn't taste like the authentic Hakka style chili chicken. The chow mein tasted like a greasy hot mess. Never again. The portions are big but the quality just isn't there. Nobody in the house enjoyed this food and we all like Hakka style."}
{"text":"Awesome takeout place for their chicken pakoras.  I was hooked the moment I tried one at a friend's potluck.  I usually order a party tray of it for dinner parties now.  I also like their fried rice."}
{"text":"The food was decent/average, I ordered Schezwan Chicken and House Special Manchurian Fried Rice. I was surprised to see corn in the fried rice, it seems like they use the frozen food that one typically gets from the grocery stores.  I will not go back again because I am sure there are places better than this out there."}
{"text":"This is a pretty good place to get Hakka food! It's not a dine in place however! It's only take out or catering. The prices are really good too and very cheap for the amount you get! Lots of vegetarian options and spring rolls are yummy!   The lunch specials are limited to a few options of their choice but they come with your choice of meal AND spring roll OR pop can OR water bottle. It's only $7 unless u go for the premium options like fried rice or noodles.   The waiting space is super small, so order in before you go so you can just pay and leave! The service is excellent!"}
{"text":"I ordered ahead of time for lunch as I was told that it usually gets busy. The lady on the phone was farily polite and noted that it would be a 25 minute wait for 3 orders. For that long of a wait, I expected the food to taste a lot more fresh!! The general tao chicken was way too soggy and bland. As well as the rice being extremely hard. A friend of mine got the Singaporean noodles and all we could taste was curry powder. Tastes just like fast food, but not fast!   Overall, won't be coming back."}
{"text":"So spicy and flavorful! Shrimp Pakoras really good and not too oily. Chicken tangra really tasty too (if you like chicken tikka masala you'll love this!). Appreciated the fact that the manchurian seafood rice actually tasted like seafood (instead of a oil-flavorless-spicy taste) and did not have too much food coloring."}
{"text":"Went only once after calling in the order. Chatted with the person there about the lack of  Hakka options in the Unionville area. Got home to find out they burnt the food leaving a strong scent. Either cook had a cold or didn't care and just switched pot to finish the dish after burning the first."}
{"text":"Great value! Surprised more Hakka restaurants aren't opening up given the demographics of the Markham area.  Its a hidden gem! Affordable prices, generous quantities and great quality tasting food!  This is our new go to spot for take-out."}
{"text":"This is my favourite restaurant for a quick and bang for our buck takeout!  Normally, we like to order the hot and sour soup, chicken pakora, fried rice, chicken and beef dish.  For two people, this is enough for dinner and plenty for the next day. If you're not use to spicy, you can ask for milder spice.  Whenever we don't feel like cooking, we think about this restaurant. It's affordable and the staff here are always nice."}
{"text":"I FINALLY decided to try this place out after years of seeing tangra featured of the snap stories of my friends.  Tangra is a go-to restaurant for flavourful, spicy, comfort foods. They primarily focus on chicken, beef, fish, and shrimp but also offer a variety of noodle, rice, and vegetarian dishes. Most of the dishes are wet and saucy ie. their chili dishes, mango dishes, sweet and spicy, sweet and sour dishes are heavily marinated with sauces and stir-fried onions. If you are looking for something dry however, I highly recommend the Tangra-Villa Meat dishes.   To say Tangra is flavourful is an understatement. With every bite I can taste the garlic, the spices, the onions, and the parsley used in the seasoning. This is definitely an upgrade from the typical garlic and soy sauce dressing in other local Chinese restaurants.  The lady manning the phone was polite, the portion sizes were fair, and the overall takeout experience was pretty great. For around $22 tax included, my family of four was stuffed with enough leftovers for lunch the next day. Good deal.  However, do call ahead of time because it takes them 20-30 minutes usually to cook 2-3 take-out dishes, and you will have to wait in the car since the store itself is quite compact."}
{"text":"This is a good take-out place for hakka food in the north end of Markham.  They have a wide selections of dishes to choose from and offer 10% off with cash payment. They always have food ready for you at the time requested (unlike Fredericks; unreliable with pick up). Chili chicken is not as good as Fredericks but this location is much more convenient for me.  My favourite dishes here are: Tangra villa chicken, crispy ginger beef.  I will come back and try other dishes next time. They also offer party trays at reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Small takeout place in a plaza. Food portion is good. Great food, tastes good. I love the hot & sour soup but not the Tom Yum soup.   Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Okay Hakka cuisine. I've had a lot better. For the prices they charge the food should be a lot better, but it's not.   I only come here once in a while if I'm in the mood for Hakka and dont feel like driving south to get real authentic Hakka chilli chicken.   I guess you could say this is my second yet first option just because it's so close to my house."}
