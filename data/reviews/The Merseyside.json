{"text":"Nice new coffee shop just north of Dundas West Station. Super friendly owner and staff, good selection of coffee and tea drinks, tasty treats. 6 tables for two people and a bar with 4 stools in the window. Liked the music they were playing and enjoyed the free WiFi, which apparently is not available on the weekend. Really enjoyed this place."}
{"text":"Great coffee (especially milk drinks) and the breakfast sandwiches are really good too. I usually don't like getting my coffee to stay but drinking a latte out of their big glasses is actually enjoyable. 

Staff is very nice and efficient as well. Solid spot all around."}
{"text":"Strolled in here on an early Sunday morning back in December and was greeted by friendly staff and excellent food and drink. Simple baked goods and breakfast items shine at great prices. Had a peameal breakfast sandwich, Americano, and scone and was more than pleased. Warm atmosphere and strong coffee make me return whenever I'm in the area - a real highlight"}
{"text":"Quick and friendly service! I really enjoyed their chai latte and iced hibiscus ginger tea (which is much better than Starbucks' iced teas). Fair prices and tons of seating space! I love the wood furniture and the natural sunlight that comes from the large window. Their baked goods are also massive! I hope they have vegan options in the future."}
{"text":"Oh man, the Mersey Fog has become my favourite drink! Friendly staff and fantastic sandwiches and snacks keep me coming back!"}
{"text":"I consider Merseyside to be one of the neighbourhood gems! Very friendly service, great coffee (love their cappuccino!), tasty sandwiches and amaaaazing scones (the apple and cheddar is a perfect mix of sweet and savoury). HUGE plus for giving off that neighbourly vibe without any pretentiousness. 

It's a nice quiet coffeeshop with a good amount of seating and plenty of natural light. They were also super accommodating with a last minute sandwich order for a wedding. They managed to grill everything, package them into shareable quarters, and still be fresh by the time we picked them up. Everyone loved the flavour and options, and tried a little bit of everything. The boureka got some really high praise. 

This coffeeshop has definitely become my go to for my caffeine and baked good needs. :)"}
{"text":"Nice new little coffee shop. They serve Propeller coffee which is nice and nutty and caramely. They also bake their own pastries and such. I had the apple ginger scone. It had generous size Apple chunks and was very gingery. My wife had the brownie. If you like moist and chocolaty this is for you.

They said there are plans in the works to get a liquor license and to build a patio out back. I look forward to that next summer!

Needless to say, we'll be back!"}
{"text":"I was having an ok day, it was a little chilly and a touch windier than how i like, but I'm willing to overlook that. I walked in, not knowing what to expect. The temperature on the inside was ideal, a charming 2 degrees above room temperature, if my goose bumps were correct. The air was not too thin, nor was it too thick. An easy breathe. I inhaled deeply, sensing the eyes of a nearby infant on my supple face. I turned to the miniature person, ready to toss it a bonbon, as per uge, when I noticed the font of the menu script. It was pleasing. An interesting choice for a coffee shop, not one I would choose personally, but I appreciated the boldness. Very avant garde. My gaze moved to the food display, arranged alphabetically. Ordering coffee, I applied my knowledge of grinds, inquiring on soaking time of the beans prior to caffein immersion. The question was received politely, but I was not completely satisfied. I ordered plain yogurt, two latt√©es and a fruit. I will not state which fruit as that is too personal. For more information on the type of fruit feel free to contact me, but I will require some background information first. Overall, a great source of sustenance."}
{"text":"Their unassuming breakfast sandwiches will blow you away. Seriously. I kind of don't want other people to know about this little gem, but they really deserve to do well & stick around so go check it out!"}
{"text":"Whenever I have a morning off, I love to pop in to grab a coffee and something baked. I recently had one of their banana date scones, paired with a drip coffee. Delicious. The scone wasn't too sweet, and the chunks of dates and banana were perfect that morning. The prices are comparable to Starbucks pricing, in my opinion, and rightfully so for the different range of treats and sandwiches they bring to the cafe every week or so. I'm very happy to have this cafe in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"What an adorable quaint cafe just north of High Park.  This super clean and chill space is quite nice for someone to sit and relax with a cup.  Though it isn't big, there is enough seating for at least 15 people without being completely overcrowded.  It helps the front space is pretty generous.  The tables here are all nicely clean and well organized.  They had some latin beats playing to a very quiet cafe.  Though there was maybe 4 other people, it feel so still.  

Service here is polite and attentive with a helpful attitude in case you had questions.  I saw a lot of people arrive to just do take out of food or a drink and each time they were greeted quickly with a smile.  

Flat White - I was glad to see Propeller coffee beans served here.  With the Turbo (darker roast), I knew the flavour would be richer than the one I had experienced.  I found the flat white to be decent but it was really more of a latte as it had a lot of milk to dilute the espresso shot.  It's a good latte flavour but definitely missing the boldness of a true flat white. 3/5

Chocolate Madeleine cookies - Made in house, these were the texture of a super rich brownie.  So for all those who love a fudgey brownie texture, this would be good for you.  As for flavour, it had a super bold bitter dark chocolate taste.  A very rich cocoa with very little sweetness.  I found it a perhaps too bitter for a cookie since I was asking which of their baked good was the sweetness.  Still a great texture ... just could have used a tad more sweet to balance the cocoa.  3/5

Nice little neighbourhood spot for those who don't want the crowds and a decent cup.  Helps that the service here is the right touch."}
{"text":"Was super early for an appointment nearby so decided to sit down and enjoy a simple breakfast: Latte and Toasted Coconut Croissant.  It was quite busy when I first walked in where there were about 3 people waiting for the orders and about 5 occupied tables (and at the bar by the window).

Merseyside has a back area where I have not seen it used much.  I decided to sit there while I wait for my glass of latte and sandwich.

There is no wifi in weekend but I was lucky to have received it from the owner as he overheard I had asked for it.  

I love their menu here--everything is made in-house from soups, sandwiches, scones and all done so deliciously.  Previously I had the breakfast peameal sandwich and was hoping to enjoy it today.  As it was busy it slipped their minds, it was an honest mistake and alternatively I got the toasted coconut croissant--and yummy! 

It was a sunny Sunday so it was nice to see people getting out and about and enjoying their morning."}
{"text":"That was AWFUL. Don't order any of the breakfast sandwiches: precooked ingredients flattened in a sandwich grill but barely warmed. No posted prices."}
