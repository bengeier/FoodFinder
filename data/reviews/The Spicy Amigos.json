{"text":"Came here for lunch last week and was pleasantly surprised.  Very fresh and tasty Mexican food.  I had the toastadas with 3 different kinds of meat.  A little on the pricey side but worth it.  Also had great service, friendly staff and clean."}
{"text":"If you want Mexican for a reasonable price in this city, you gotta go here! The quesadilla, tacos, burritos and the tortilla soup are all fantastic! The staff is friendly, and I continue to go back because of the service"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! And great service as well! Glad I forgot a lunch today and discovered this little gem!"}
{"text":"Tasty, authentic Mexican street food that gives appropriate portions relative to the prices."}
{"text":"First time here since it changed ownership. Had a burrito and beer for lunch and loved it. I will certainly be coming back here. Better quality than the chain Mexican restaurant in town. 
The menu is very extensive and the protein selection is great. 
The best part is... OPEN TILL 4AM ON SATURDAY NIGHTS! I will certainly be stopping in here after a night on the town."}
{"text":"A little hole in the wall for some really delicious Mexican street food! If I'm to busy to cook or craving a burrito or quesadilla, this is the spot I come to. The chicken tinga thats made here is out of this world! Enjoy it whatever option you'd like, trust me you'll be coming back for more. On top of that, the guacamole and pico is made from scratch and it's unlike anything I've found in the city. They'll even make some for you if you need it for a party (like Cinco de Mayo!). And to finish off a delicious meal, you can grab the tres leches cake. Super moist and full of flavor, can't go wrong with it."}
{"text":"Glad these guys moved in on the block! It's quick if you want to pick up or have a quick lunch but it's not 'fast-food'. The staff are very friendly, prices are great for real cooked food. If you like Mexican food you don't have a lot of choice in Calgary, you will not regret making a trip to try these guys!"}
{"text":"I have been in search of good grilled steak tacos here in Calgary for 2 years. Unfortunately, I did not find them here.
Their tortillas taste strange, maybe that's authentic but they mostly just taste like too much flour. The meat in the taco honestly tasted like Taco bell. Clearly poor quality meat (not necessary since they charge almost 4$ for a tiny taco) and the seasoning also resembled what I've had at taco bell
 The toppings for the taco were just cut up tomatoes and onions. No sauce, no aioli nothing. It was very dry.
Overall I was very disappointed. 
I will continue my search for a good steak taco like one can find in Victoria, BC"}
{"text":"In my last review I mentioned getting charged for extras, including jalapenos. that was definitely a once-off and in the 4 times i've been after it's clear that was definitely a small mistake that I should have mentioned when checking out. Now having met the staff several times, I know they would have acknowledged the issue and fixed it. 

Had the bistek 10 inch burrito with guac and all the fixings. drowned in the Hot green and red sauces on the side and a soda. 12 bucks all in, and i was so full i didnt even have dinner. Love this place, and will continue coming back. :)"}
{"text":"Spicy Amigos is the old Jalape√±os. I'm not sure if the owners have changed or just the name, but the food is still delicious. I don't feel that there is that many good Mexican restaurants in Calgary, but spicy amigos offers authenticity and affordability. I went with R and he got the chicken quesadilla and I got the 4 tacos,  each plate was $12 and loaded with lots of toppings like lettuce and fresh pico de gallo. They also have a small salsa section where you serve yourself to mild/medium and spicy salsa with your meal. There is a large variety of meats to choose from including beef tongue for the more adventurous. Give thris place a try!"}
{"text":"Great food, service and price. Everything we tried was full of delicious flavour and with nine different unlimited homemade salsas to choose from, lots of choices of meats and the fact they are very generous with all of the toppings we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Greasy, tasteless meat, only used one taco instead of two, so they just fell apart as soon as you tried to pick them up. Salsa was very good but the chips were smash to crumbs. $40 for tacos and chips for two people is obscene especially for the low quality. The hunt continues for any kind of decent Mexican in Calgary but I'm pretty sure it's a lost cause. Too bad I couldn't a give zero star review."}
{"text":"Fantastic spot for lunch with great value for your money.   I was attending meetings at the building next door and went out to grab a bite with a colleague.  There isn't much around so this was chosen out of convenience but am I glad I did!  I only work a few blocks over and will definitely be back now that I have been introduced to this gem.  First of the staff are fantastic.  Super friendly, keep the orders moving and offer suggestions if you are stuck for what to chose.  There is a nice selection of drinks including mexica sodas (cane sugar) which is a thing for me.  I had quesadilla with the tinga chicken which had a bit of heat but not too much, just a nice kick.  The tortilla was fresh and they put the right amount of cheese, not too much, not greasy, just right.  Fresh lettuce, tomato, jalapenos are an option just not for me.  The portion size was probably a bit big for me for lunch but I couldn't help myself and finished the whole thing.  Honestly I could have taken 1/2 home for later which is why I say good value for the price.  The quality ingredients and the portion size are definitely worth the price.  Do know that it is busy at lunch but don't be intimidated by the line, it moves fast!"}
{"text":"This is our first time here with the renovations and new management, and all we have to say is, \"Wow!\". They really stepped up their game! The decor is amazing and the food is to die for. They have started making their own tortillas (so good!) and have added several new items to their already fantastic menu. The shrimp especiale taco is UNREAL. If that tamarind sauce was the last thing I ever ate, I would die happy. We also checked out the new fish taco and chicharonn taco - perfect! This was my favourite place in the city for authentic Mexican before, and now I would say it rivals my favourites in the Southern USA."}
{"text":"Delicious! One of the best burritos, salsa and vegetables I've had in the city! This spot opens at 11 and I can visualize it backed out the door for lunch. The patio was nice to enjoy our food streetside!"}
{"text":"Went in hungry and interested, the selection looked good, tried the tacos, we had 4 each, some chips and salsa and pop and it came to $40, so I thought this better be good. 
The beef steak tacos were so greasy, that my 2nd one fell apart because the corn taco was soaked in grease, being single wrapped this just left a greasy mess and the beef steak tasted like crumbled burger. The pork tacos were far superior and would have been great if they too were not so greasy. 
We could not finish the salsa, which was exceptionally good, because the tortilla chips were smashed into pieces so small you could not scoop any. A real shame as it looked very appealing."}
{"text":"We were in the mood for tacos, and came across this little spot. Immediately we were greeted with smiling faces and overall a friendly atmosphere. The selection was great, and their personal favourites as suggestions even better! We each had an order of assorted tacos and shared nachos.. we were not disappointed! Walked out with full, satisfied and happy tummies! Overall, very very pleased. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Friendly, fresh, authentic Mexican food for a great price. These guys are the real deal. Lots of vegetarian options, and easy to eat dairy-free and still enjoy the meal. Excellent refried beans, guacamole, tostadas and tacos."}
{"text":"Great Mexican joint in the west side of downtown.  Much better than Mucho Burrito and Quesada's.  Open late on some nights if you're out and about.

Their burritos are the best value, they let you split your protein into two types if you want to try something different.  Went on a Tuesday and tried their Taco Tuesday ($2 per taco).  Had to get the La Lengua (cow tongue) which is always lean, tender and flavorful.  Bistek and chicken were just OK.  The pork was great and I added fresh guac on the side for some extra $.

The key here is that they have a self serve salsa bar which is amazing and fresh.  Three spice levels (mild, medium, hot) with green and red salsa, along with pickled veg at each spice level.  I make sure I fill up one cup of each salsa and pickled veg and get refills on my favorite (green).

Nice fresh Mexican food, pretty much everything will be messy so make sure you grab some utensils."}
{"text":"One of the better down to earth Tacos I have had in Calgary, authentic, clean, and with great service.
I went there on a late afternoon on a week day.
I'm not a big fan of chicken, but their chicken tacos had the perfect amount of spice and flavour."}
{"text":"I had the chicken Tinga enchilada in mole sauce. The chicken was dry and the rice was quite stale . Their sauces are not bad which helped make the dish edible. 
Overall, it's Taco Bell quality food - with some extra sauces. The service was really good and the ambience was not bad . I went after reading all the reviews, though I do see now that they are mixed. Maybe they have a different crew some days."}
{"text":"Downtown west which honestly feels like Downtown forgotten west has quite limited options. Finding Mexican at walking distance was well, a luck. And finding great Mexican food, pure blessing!

So they address you as Amigo. Nice. A bit too much but hey, let it slide. It's fun e'h!?

Got 'Plato Amigo' which comes with rice, two choices of meat, pico de gallo and black beans. I thought I'd love the shredded chicken but surprisingly it was the tender marinated chicken which filled me with pleasure. And don't forget to get salsa and pickled vegetables which next time I'm gonna fill up on. 

Now again, this maybe a Calgary thing but I again got a feeling that I grossly overpaid for the quantity. Why are plates or salad servings so freakishly small?

Anyhoo, I was very happy with quality and taste of my food.  Next on, the jumbo burrito amigo!"}
{"text":"Very good Mexican food and very convenient location! I had a burrito and it was delicious! My only complain was the service that it was not very friendly at lunch time. I can understand they were busy, but they still have to be nice, as customers pay for service as much as we pay for the food. 

The cashier should be told to smile to customers and not having a mad face; as it is part of a good service."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner on a whim was not disappointed at alllll. Servers were really friendly, gave us some crunchy peanut things at the table that were really good. The menus not extremely extensive so don't expect pages of choice but they have a great variety of tacos. The tacos we go were extremely flavourful and the salsas they gave us to go with them were great! We went at night on a Saturday and it wasn't to busy so if you want a quick meal and are seeing a movie at Eau Claire or just hanging out down town this is a sweet spot"}
