{"text":"I love this little cold pressed juice stand! The juices are pretty healthy and taste super awesome! I am glad this place is open in Scottsdale mall for me - closer than the one at the Biltmore. The \"Strengthen\" juice with protein and almond milk and cinnamon is amazing!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed the chopped salad with 150 ingredients.  This is a good place to buy cold pressed juice and acai bowls.  The staff was nice."}
{"text":"I thought their juice was okay.  They are super pricey compared to some of local competitors around Fashion Square. Almost $11 dollars for a single bottle of juice. I think I will stick with juice core or chop shop."}
