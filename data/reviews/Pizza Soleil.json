{"text":"Very delicious pizza slices on the go, many choices to choose from , generous toppings at affordable price. Located at the heart of downtown in the famous McGill metro station."}
{"text":"Surprisingly good pizza for being in the Metro! Great place to grab a quick slice while on your way"}
{"text":"I've never gotten the pizza here, mostly because I'm not really a fan of pizza. I know metro food gets a bad rep but it really shouldn't. I've had sushi from a metro place and it was good.  I order the meat pies/Jamaican patties from here. They're much cheaper (2$) than Coco bun (2.88$). Plus they have great combos, for 5 dollars you can get 2 plus a drink.   They're always heated up, it makes them too hot to eat right away which is kind of a bummer because  I enjoy them a lot and want to eat them right away."}
{"text":"Whenever I am in a hurry, I always get slices to go as it's delicious and warm and easy to eat when you're on your way home. Their pizzas are delicious and cheap. They have a huge variety of flavours, my fav is their chicken one and garlic one. Would keep on going :)"}
{"text":"Working in a building connected to the underground city, I often walk past this pizza place inside McGill metro station but never tried them out until recently. The delicious smell of pizza permeates in that area of the metro.  It is a typical fast food \"pizza slice\" place where they have different types of pre-made pizzas and you order a slice or two. They then put your slice(s) into a large toaster oven of sorts and within 1 minute, you have a warmed up and tasty pizza.  I decided to get the two slices of pizza and a drink combo and opted for a slice of all dressed pizza and a slice of mushroom pizza with a can of Coke Zero. They have different types of combos including getting fries or a poutine or what appears to be Jamaican patty with your pizza. The prices appeared to be decent. Including taxes, my two slice pizza combo with drink cost me $7.95. Both the pizzas that I had were good. They weren't the best pizza I've tasted even coming from these \"pizza slice\" places but I still liked them.  They accept credit cards.  Even though this place technically does not offer free WiFi itself, it is right in front of Promenades Cathedrale and sitting within the pizza place, I found that a WiFi signal from Promenades Cathedrale to be strong enough for me to do some light browsing. Although probably not technically allowed, there is also nothing really preventing someone from taking their slices of pizza and just eating within Promenades Cathedrale's food court to get a better wireless signal."}
{"text":"This is a little place in the metro and their pizza is surprisingly good. I had a slice of chicken pizza and was really impressed at how nice the crust was - light, not greasy and wonderfully crisp on the bottom (the good kind of crisp, not that cut-your-gums kind of crisp that a lot of pizza is.)  The seating area isn't the cleanest - the floor was kind of dirty and it kind of had the feel of a high traffic area, which I guess it is.   This isn't the kind of place to sit and hang out, but if you're in the area and need a quick, affordable bite to eat (less than $5 for two slices and a drink), it's a great little stop. They have several varieties available if you just want a slice and I think they also do whole pizzas made to order."}
{"text":"This place is a nice surprise. It may not look much but if you are in a need for a quick grab or a nice slice you found your place. They have some nice combo deals and the vege slices that I tried were tasty and not too oily. My friend also liked their empanadas, he said they are a little dry but good. Anyway a nice fast food place that doesnt look promising at first but will keep you full and happy almost for free"}
