{"text":"Food is amazing but the service is slow. There's no sense of urgency to attend to the guest. I only see a waitress at the beginning of my order and when I receive my food. If there's room for improvement it's the service. Just the urgency and attentiveness to guest. The attitude of the staff is pretty good."}
{"text":"Lost good and easy money from large party due to poor management and timing. TIP: Keep your word... Say what you mean and mean what you say."}
{"text":"First problem was securing a reservation. Trying over a 3 day period unsuccessfully by phone and unable to leave a voicemail cause it was at capacity and finally forced to go in person. The online restaurant website only allowed customers to reserve for advertised events when I only wanted to secure a seat for brunch. Maybe use an online system like Open Table to accommodate all events. Second, music selections. Either play jazz for a jazzy brunch or have a DJ. Having competing music play simultaneously is too much. Mute the tv screens and let one genre play. Pick one music theme and stick with it. Having a baby grand piano with an unskilled vocalist was torture. Third, clear communication between hostess, servers, bar and kitchen. If you no longer carry a brand then provide alternatives. You cannot have a drink menu with items you are out of and have the waitress run back and forth to inquire. Making Moves is a drink special calling for rye and ginger beer and out of two of three major ingredients. Communication is key. If you are out of something provide alternatives in advance to servers so recommendations are lined up and things go smoothly. Presentation is everything and proper plating is necessary no matter who the chef is. Ordered the fried whiting and Grits and received a plate with congealed grits (it sat so long and had cooled off) with whiting served skin side up instead of the meaty part being displayed. My friend and I asked to provide some feedback to the chef, JR Robinson. He came, listened, apologized and offered to make us something else. He singlehandedly saved brunch. There are growing pains but the entire staff must work in tandem with the chef as customers support the face of the establishment which includes service, food and ambiance. My hope is they will thrive and grow and I firmly believe they will!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere and the food was good. The presentation however not consistent. The salt and pepper shakers looked like it was wet so we couldn't use it. Some people in my party returned their grits but others said they liked theirs. The chicken and waffle was good but some plates had more chicken than others. Overall there were Lil things that we didn't enjoy like waiting a very long time for our food but the waitress was nice and the majority of us truly enjoyed our meals."}
{"text":"I loved it here. Great good and I really like the ambiance. I came here during the NFL playoffs and the place was packed. I ordered a burger and mac and cheese and it delicious. My friends had some beers and various items on the menu with no complaints. It's a relatively new spot but I'm liking it so far."}
{"text":"Never been here before but my very first time coming, had a party of four and was totally ignored. My friends ordered drinks and it never came, after 45 minutes we tried to wave down a waitress and she didn't even look our way.   A table that was seated after us got drinks and food so we decided to leave. We understand it was packed but someone could have at least acknowledged we were there and told us she'd be with us whenever she got a chance. Totally unacceptable service... probably could have been a great place to eat too."}
{"text":"Great experience, food was delicious, I had the lobster and macroni and cheese. My server was attentive and professional. Will go back."}
{"text":"As it's only been open a couple months, it's not a surprise that tonight was my first time visiting the restaurant and bar. What is surprising is how good food could leave such a bad aftertaste in my mouth.  The service was fairly good, although the server didn't know what beers were available on draft. As there were only six beers on draft, I'm thinking he might want to brush up on his memorization skills. But he was very attentive, when asked for anything from anyone (extra napkins, another drink, silverware for new arrivals) he always brought it promptly, and he was very likable. I have no complaints about the service.  I ordered the Curveball Club Sandwich. The description made it sound like a normal club sandwich, but instead of a traditional club served on three thin slices of toast, I got a turkey and bacon sandwich served on two thick slabs of Texas toast.  To the preparer's credit, the meat and toppings were arranged evenly across the entire sandwich. As anyone who's ordered a sandwich anywhere from Arby's to the higher-end chain restaurants can attest, that's unusual. Most of the time, all the meat and toppings are plopped in the middle without a second thought. So I appreciate the obvious care the preparer took when making my sandwich.  But I wasn't expecting a turkey and bacon sandwich on very thick toast.  It had a good flavor - the turkey and bacon were both very good - but after finishing most of the first half of the sandwich, I realized there was no cheese in the sandwich, even though the description of the club specifically mentioned cheddar cheese. It's funny, because even after adjusting my expectations upon seeing the non-club club sandwich, something felt off, but I was too busy talking to my friends to notice there wasn't any cheese at first.  I asked the waiter if he'd bring me a half a slice of cheddar for the other half of my sandwich, as I was planning on bringing it home to eat later. At that point, I felt like it would be silly to put some cheese on the remains of the first half of my sandwich.  A couple of minutes later, he came back to the table and told me there was no cheddar cheese available in the kitchen, but he could bring me a slice of American cheese.  The restaurant had been open for less than an hour. It was not busy. I can't imagine why they did not have any cheddar cheese. The restaurant is located maybe a couple thousand yards from a Food Lion, and maybe a half mile at best from a Harris Teeter, and they had no cheddar cheese. This is a restaurant that offers cheeseburgers. And they had no cheddar cheese.  Evidently, they named it the Curveball Club because it wasn't actually a club sandwich and it didn't contain the cheese promised in the description. Randomly bizarre, much?  With all that said, I have to say I wasn't unhappy. Again, the service was good, the food was good even without the cheese, and the people I was with seemed to enjoy their meals. In my mind, I was already composing how I'd describe the thick toast and lack of cheddar cheese to my friends later when describing my dinner.  BUT THEN I GOT THE BILL.  I was planning on giving this restaurant three stars. I don't think it's the greatest, but it's not the kind of place I'd normally eat in anyway, and while the lack of cheese (or rather the explanation for the lack of cheese) was weird, it wasn't a bad sandwich, even if it wasn't a club sandwich.  But I ended up being charged $23 for the meal - $5.00 for each of the two beers I drank and $13.00 for the sandwich. It wasn't until I got home and thought about it that I realized they had overcharged me by $3 for a sandwich that wasn't even what was described. The menu said it was $10. I verified on their website that it's $10. But they charged me $13.  I could live with that - it's only $3 - but then...  They also tried to con me into paying a tip twice.  They charged me a $4.14 gratuity. That's standard - most restaurants charge an 18% tip for groups of six or eight. But on the final bill, the one you write the tip in and sign, there was no mention whatsoever that the subtotal included that 18% gratuity charge. Instead, there was a tip guide letting you know how much to tip on a total that ALREADY INCLUDED AN 18% TIP.  I paid $29 for a moderately good sandwich and two small draft beers.  And then they want to try and trick me into paying a second tip.  So yeah, I'm not giving them three stars. I'm giving them one.  And if you have a problem with that, you can pay the $9.90 tip I would have given if I hadn't been paying attention on an overpriced $23 meal. (That includes the $4.14 tip charged automatically since I was part of the group and the $5.76 recommended tip I would have paid if I hadn't checked the original bill and seen that the tip was already included in my subtotal.)  That's some devious crap they're trying to get away with."}
{"text":"My friend is always raving about this place so I decided to tag along with her tonight. I ordered an apple martini an drunken apple cheesecake. Both were extremely delicious. The bartender Ess was very attentive in making sure our visit was pleasant and I appreciate it. I will definitely be back for a second time."}
{"text":"The customer service is excellent. Well trained staff. Big improvement over blu notes.  However, this is not really a sports bar.  I kinda felt like they need to make up their mind.   Jazz music? They need to pick a theme and stick to it.  The decor was classy and then they have tacky fake grass as a carpet.  I get it.  Supposed to look like a football field. But it just doesnt match.   I hope it lasts though.  It was pretty empty on a Friday happy hour which is never a good sign.   They should advertise to all the business parks near by. Especially Wells Fargo and IBM drive area. Better signage out front would help. The sign is not very visible from the main road."}
{"text":"Stats...Sports bar...Brunch until 3?  Sorry...not a Sports bar...light jazz music playing in the background.  All the TVs had football in them...but that's as far as the sports vibe goes.  With as limited as the menu is, not sure what to call this place."}
{"text":"I went there one Sunday evening, pretty decent amount of people were there. Food was good, service was ok. I think it was due to the amount of people. But overall I think it's a good restaurant. The manager came out and spoke with us to make sure our experience was going well. I'll definitely be going back."}
{"text":"I'm almost afraid to write this review, this location has been so many different things, it may change again before I complete my review.  I stopped by after church for brunch after reading some of the reviews.  I thought it was more of a bar, but when I walked in someone was singing and playing the piano......weird but ok.  They have a limited brunch menu which is good.  I ordered the fish and grits with butter crab sauce according to the menu, but when it came out I didn't see any crab even though the picture on their instagram page clearly shows crab but I was told it's just a sauce and if I wanted crab I had to request it.....um, ok.....crab please.  That combo of fish, grits, and crab was superb!  Creamy grits, perfectly seasoned fish, and lump crab.....no words.  I also tried the chicken and waffles, it was pretty good but the waffle was soft which I asked for it to be crispy.  I was impressed with how good the food was and will be returning soon."}
{"text":"This place has potential. They are at a very good start if you ask me just a few tweaks here and there. Our server was either extremely new or extremely nervous when helping us; she was very sweet but made things awkward when coming to check on us. I ordered the fish tacos with a side of Mac and my friend ordered the sliders with fries. The food was basic to me nothing I would crave but maybe something i would grab if I was in the area. The drinks were good though so def a good spot for your bar preferences."}
{"text":"First time here after the renovation. Was very unsatisfying. Crab dip appetizer took 20 mins to come out. It tasted bland and had 4 pieces of crab sprinkled on top. Main entree came out 15 mins later. Fish extremely bland even with extra aioli sauce.   Really hoped for a better experience."}
{"text":"Stats is a beautiful establishment with a great outdoor patio for socializing and mingling. The inside space is also enjoyable, because of the awesome sound system, and lighting. However, the bartenders are the absolute worse. They move extremely slow, they serve all men before women on purpose, and they have horrible attitudes!    Would I visit this establishment again? NO"}
{"text":"FOUR WORDS: LOBSTER MACARONI AND CHEESE. Literally. The best fried lobster tail I have EVER had!! Omg. I had to FaceTime my mother & BEG HER to come & try this item!! (we pride ourselves as black women who jokingly make the best \"Blackaroni n'Cheese\" ever..) Aside from the wonderfully light & crunchy batter on the lobster (which was insanely moist & fresh despite being fried) the mac n'cheese was like a Gouda/Cheddar blend or something!!? Amazing. I went on a Thursday night so it was Wing Nite. My friend & I felt obligated to order because half priced... & tried the Jerk BBQ (charred style). Those were pretty gr8 (I'm enjoy a Pescatarian diet so my love for chicken, in general, is pretty weak nowadays) but if you love wings: you'll be impressed. $5 Hurricanes & $3 draft specials honestly made the entire experience incredible... but the SHOW STOPPER ?? I begged the bartender to bring the Chef out (in a strategic attempt to successfully guess what was in the cheese sauce) and he actually came out before the end of our meal to indulge my compliments & playfully jealous sentiments on being a MAN capable of knocking a mac n'cheese out the park!! Wonderful service, cool energy, live DJ after 9p... STATS is a nice time hopefully here to stay!!!"}
{"text":"The food was good and the service was on point. Ms. Monique was a great bartender. All of the other staff was friendly and welcoming. I had the lobster Mac and cheese and spinach crab dip was delish. Sorry I didn't get a pic of the lobster Mac and cheese. I guess my excitement took over! Lol. I will definitely be going back soon so I will capture it then. But there are other pics here that capture it. We sat at the bar which was perfect. The place was not crowded which was also perfect and laid back. Overall great experience!"}
{"text":"Slow service.  Bartenders can not handle a crowd and move super slow.  No order and no customer service considered."}
{"text":"This place has a nice chill vibe. I was invited here on a Sunday to attend a birthday brunch with a group of friends! This is a great place to go grab a bite to eat with a group or even by yourself if you please. There's a bar for you to order a nice drink and you can even order hookah to smoke. This is a great spot to watch football on Sundays.   When I walked in for the brunch I was greeted by a pianist. She was singing as well. This really set the mood for an upscale restaurant . But when I stepped further in and got comfortable I realized that it was actually a laidback atmosphere.   I really enjoyed myself and even thought the food was delicious! I ordered the fish and grits and they served me a big portion, so big I was able to share! The service was also very good as well! The waitress continuously asked if everything was ok, so I was pleased with that!   When I looked at the prices I thought it was rather pricey but when the food came out I then realized you definitely get your moneys worth! I can't wait to visit this spot again!"}
{"text":"The wait here is really long. Food is mediocre. I wouldn't waste my time going back honestly. We spent like 2 1/2 hours here"}
{"text":"So we came here to watch one of the basketball games and also have dinner. my friends orders chicken wings with fries and shrimp and my order was chicken wings am I to friends order chicken wings and the other 1 ordered shrimp. My friend that order shrimp she sent it back because it was so so so so so so so sad salty she even had me tasted and I spit it out it was horrible. The waiter took it back to thr kitchen.  a few moments later as she come down with a second order of shrimp and she said that and she said that she told the cook that it was salty and that he would change the batter because the batter mixture with action and salty so he would change it here goes shop number 2 she took 1 bite and it was extremely softly she asked me to taste it and it was the exact same saltiness as the 1st goal horrible horrible horrible I cannot believe that they would take back the plane and send out the exact same the that makes no sense so my other friend that daughter queens with a flavor they brought her the 1 with the wrong flavor and heard with also salty and coal so she sent her niece back and then it came back out the next time and she ate it my wings that I order or app center in the licious I have 0 issues for my beverage I have water I have 0 issues with my glass of water my friend however had alcoholic drink and they said that they were delicious and they enjoy your dreams service here on any particular day or time is slow not the normal slow this is a normal slowly You see many many waitresses running around lap to light just running running running running running go on back-and-forth to the kitchen back a forth to the bar but you don't see many plate so I food coming out or drinks coming out and on an average most times when I have busied it is a establishment I normally have to wait 20 to 30 minutes for my alcoholic drink from the bar so since I have given this establishment many many Many chances I have to decide to stop coming here also I was told that the new hangout spot is down the street and another local bar and so that's where I'm gonna try next time when I decide to yatsh a sporting event on TV with my friends"}
{"text":"We visited Stats for the first time tonight. It's a nice space in the Davis Lakes community right off of W.T. Harris Blvd. The restaurant is very large and can easily accommodate big parties. It's sports themed with a a lot of floor space (could be a dance floor), multiple TVs, and a large bar. Our waitress was nice, she mentioned she normally doesn't work there but was just helping out for the night. They seemed to lack servers and hostesses when we got there but that could be because we arrived shortly after they opened their doors. There is no Kid's portions which was disappointing...Nonetheless we placed our orders. The kitchen was slow and there was a long wait time to receive our food. I had the fried fish sandwich and fries...both were good. My kids shared the Fish & Chips: the fish comes drizzled with a orange colored sauce that they did not like but I was able to wipe it off. My husband liked his chicken sandwich and fries. Both sandwiches came on a brioche bun (which I love) This spot has a lot of potential for future success. I would recommend making sure they have enough people in the kitchen to move orders out more quickly and ensuring that they have enough servers. I'll definitely be back to check out again in a few months!"}
{"text":"I am very pleased by the fresh look of this place. The staff and customer service was great, the hostess was very knowledgeable about the new venue, the menu, and the events that were going to be coming. The menu is simple but a lot of great choices. There's not much on the menu but it's just hard to choose because the options are great.  I chose the chicken and waffles with a side of the cheese grits. The chicken breast was cooked to perfection, very juicy! The waffle was a great compliment to it I enjoy'd the berries that the actually added to the dishes will great plating. The grits were amazing creamy stone grits with just the right amount of cheese. The proportion sizes of all the dishes are great for the price. My friend ordered the fish and grits which she enjoy thoroughly. Our waitress, Gabriel, was very knowledgeable about the menu. The staff actually has eaten everything on the menu so they're able to tell you recommendations, which was a great plus. Overall I give this place a thumbs up love the atmosphere love the ambience staff was great."}
{"text":"Drinks to expensive and do not taste like the brand you purchased.  After trying 3 different drinks I was more than sure they pour bottom shelf alcohol into the top shelf bottles.  Bartenders slow beyond belief.  Best thing about location is the look...very clean and usually a great DJ.    My recommendation is go drunk and enjoy the party. You might leave mad as hell if you drinking that top bottom shelf with a high cost and slow service...."}
{"text":"I was in town visiting some friends, and we came into Stats to catch a few March Madness games. I was just expecting a typical sports bar, beer, wings, nothing over the top. I was very pleasantly surprised. This place had a super chill vibe, tvs everywhere, and was the perfect place to watch a game, but on top of that, their food and drinks were actually fantastic. We ended up staying well past what we originally thought, and had a blast! I absolutely would recommend."}
{"text":"This is a great spot to watch the game.They have over 15 TV's so you always have a good view of the game. We went on a Sunday to watch the football playoffs and it was busy. I'm surprised there isn't more seating during game days because the space is really big. There was a DJ there which didnt make any sense to me. He only played during the commerical and the music was all wrong for the crowd. The service was really slow, I had to ask my waitress multiple times for my minor things, my check was wrong, and the food was just okay. I might go back but the I would have to sit at the bar for better service."}
{"text":"We came here on  a Thursday around 5ish. We walk in and get seated. My first thought was nice atmosphere, the food must be pretty good too. But thats where it all ended, so they were playing this really loud, really offensive rap music with the n word, p word, and F word , all with sexual references over and over again. After we ordered our drinks we decided we couldnt take the offensive music anymore so we left before ordering our food. You have got to be kidding me, why would they play that crap so loud with customers in the restaurant?? There was also a family with a young baby seated across from us. I'll take my hard earned money elsewhere."}
{"text":"Friendly staff and good food. It's so close to home and I don't have to travel uptown for a good time.  I will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately this is one of the worst experiences I have had in a very long time. The wait service lacked communication and timelines. My party came in and sat down for approximately an hour to an hour and half before any food was brought out. The celebrity that was present was serviced well after my party had been seated. The food came out cold and unenjoyable. I would never recommend this place to any one. This is a terrible restaurant."}
{"text":"Went there today for brunch and it was a disaster! I ordered the Blackened Salmon with eggs Benedict crab cake pouched egg with hollindaise sauce!! The photo attached will detail what i actually received. The cheese grits were good but they were cold. The potato's with onions and peppers were good and warm! This was my first time eating brunch there and my last. The atmosphere is a sports bar which is nice... the brunch menu could use a little work. Our server Crystal was very nice and friendly."}
{"text":"So first and foremost they have excellent customer service from the front door to the table. We went for a friends bikers Halloween  event . Primarily for support. While there was miscommunication about the event. We ended up sitting at a table on the upper deck and ordering food off the late night Menu. We were a little irritated that we didn't get a menu when we sat down. And we waited a while for one (5 mins) and even longer for waters unfortunately. The several waitresses we had prior to being assigned to us were trying to be helpful. The place is REALLY REALLY NICE ascetically. From the lighting to layout and decor it's very trendy sports bar! The late night menu is only the left side, which is primarily everything but entrees. The menu doesn't have many options (at all) and is pretty basic. My friends got wings. He said they were salty and they looked better than they taste. The other friend got wings as well- he said they were basic nothing spectacular. They messed his order by putting salt on the fries when he asked them not too. There was a woman who- I'm assuming was the manager -made sure they corrected his meal right away; While the waitress tried to take his entire plate away the manager woman made sure he got a fresh batch. The waitress had a lot of patience and kindness . I don't eat red meat so when I asked if I chili's get chicken cheesesteak fries she made it happen. Overall, great atmosphere- okay food- awesome service!"}
{"text":"Came here with a friend to watch the game they have the greatest intentions. The resultant took a  while with the food but I don't think they planned on such a huge crowd but still always plan for a hug crowd on game day. The TVs were all around but could be turned up a bit because  the DJ would randomly play music during commercials it was a lot at times when your trying to talk.  The atmosphere was good"}
{"text":"So far we've been here twice, for dinner on a Tuesday and a Saturday brunch both times the food has been delicious. The fish and grits was absolutely delicious , my husband had the cheesesteak omelet who was very good. Service was great as well. I would recommend this spot. Please try it.. we will be back again."}
{"text":"Oh how i wish i could give this place 5 stars!.. I posted pictures just so everyone can see just how nice this little spot is for a sports bar this is the place to be. My friend and I stepped in this place and had been sitting for at least a good 30 minutes before someone finally came to  our table and spoke then told us oh we will be closing at 5 pm and the kitchen closes in 15 minutes so i don't want to rush you states the waitress. My friend had already mentioned from us sitting for awhile see this is why i can't do a black  owned establishment, that really hurt me to hear her say that because i really wanted to give this place a chance and the food looks awesome. Maybe i will try it again on a off day and see what happens and maybe we will have a better experience. With that being said we just got up and kindly walked out."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Sports bar in Charlotte this location is Ink N Ivy Meets Charlotte Urban Premier Clientele perfect for events, watching the game or just lounging on a Friday night! Wish this place the best of luck and much success! Food is amazing as well."}
{"text":"I was thoroughly excited to check this place out, as it has been a variety of restaurants over the years. Decided to give this place a try for brunch on a Sunday, because there weren't many cars in the parking lot so I figured the service would be swift and I would be in and out. Eh, I was wrong... but not entirely. Upon entering the restaurant, I like the fact that they've aimed to keep it themed with the name, as the area around the bar has football field markers. I also enjoyed the the pianist that provided music until it was time for kick off.   We were seated quickly, but it took us a little while for our waitress to acknowledge us and get our drink orders. It took about 10 minutes for our drinks to arrive and about 15 minutes for coffee, because it had to be brewed first. I was little confused, as it was brunch time, so I'm not sure as to why coffee was not one of the first things ready... but I was grateful for it when it came and didn't feel the need to complain since our waitress was nice.   We ordered our food and waited...during this time we noticed that a couple of people that came in around the same time as us, but sat at the bar, were pleasantly enjoying their meals. The elevated area we were in was not crowded but I only counted 2 or 3 waitresses, which should have been enough but there obviously was a lack of urgency with getting food orders out...not sure if that was on the kitchen or the lackadaisical of the servers. Our waitress, aware that we were now going on 30+ minutes waiting, didn't see the need to swing by our table to update us on the status of our orders. I think continuous communication is important, especially with new establishments. We finally received our food... the presentation was great but the taste was just OK. I ordered the chicken and waffles, but the chicken was meh.   I will have to try this place out again, maybe for dinner though. Overall, I look forward to improved efficiency from on service side of things."}
