{"text":"I will have to return to write a better review. I stopped in quickly in a Saturday afternoon to get some tea (I know, I know... it's a coffee shop...Why am I getting tea??). I was in a bit of a hurry so I asked for the Alpine Berry tea to go. The lady behind the counter was very friendly. The tea was delicious and I will have to return for more stuff.    The pastry cases were very tempting. They were offering Coffee cake, Zucchini bread, Black and White cookies, and other baked goods that looked amazing.     They also had an assortment of cold drinks such as water, juice etc. The space is not very big but the vibe is very chill and I could see it being a good place to get some work or studying done. Stay tuned for an update on the coffee.   **Update: Finally went back to try the coffee on a rainy Saturday afternoon. I had called in advance to see if they offered non-dairy milk and was told they had soy and almond...Yasss! Got myself an Almond Milk Cappuccino that was perfect! Velvety frothed milk and the right amount of espresso. This is the type of place University was needing. A cute coffee shop with WiFi, friendly service (Cameron was awesome), and actual coffee/espresso.    They also offer flavor syrups that come in Sugar-Free versions (although this means they use a sugar substitute and it does have some after taste). They were also hosting lots of events in February including Speed Dating, Open Mic and Live Music.   Another cool touch were the chalkboard walls inside the restroom (see pics). Looking forward to visiting more often!"}
{"text":"AMAZING!! Best caramel macchiato I've ever had and my mom said the same about her chai. We also had a muffin and crumb cake both were very fresh and not overly sweet."}
{"text":"Interesting, and on a good day probably great, but today and the last visit was unimpressive.  Small, intimate coffee shop located in the Highland Creek neighborhood that offers coffee, tea, and a couple of food offerings. If you're looking at the front of Harris Teeter, it's to the left.  Today I got the same thing I did the first time: House (Ethiopian) coffee with about 2tbsp half & half and 2 packets of sugar. The roast is great, and it tastes well brewed. The problem is it almost tastes watered down. Not watered down as they used too much water while brewing, that would over-extract and emphasize bitterness. Instead, it's like they took well roasted and fresh coffee and added water afterwards... Maybe I'm wrong, but it had a very weak, watery flavor.  I also tried the Pecan Pie square and good God do they need to warm this before serving.  The flavor was good enough, but I'm pretty sure I loosened a bond on my fixed retainer behind my teeth! Texture like set concrete. The nutty flavors would probably be more pronounced heated as well.  I may come back to try a different coffee, but I'll skip the pastries... It definitely isn't their Forte."}
{"text":"the barista this afternoon 5/6 12:30 pm was the most charismatic person the second we walked in and made me and my boyfriend the best dirty iced chais we've ever had. Wish we knew her name but keep up the amazing work!"}
{"text":"My wife and I recently moved into the area, so my first move was to find the local coffee shop. Barista Craft is tucked on the corner of a small shopping center with grocery store and pizza place, but still is a cool unique spot.  I wasn't sure of their coffee and food offerings, but the woman at the cash register steered me toward their breakfast special, which on this day was a bacon or sausage, egg, and cheese bagel w/ tater tots and a small coffee for $8.95. Not a bad deal in my opinion. I went with the bacon option and their house breakfast blend coffee.  The opted for the bacon, egg, and cheese bagel, which was good, but not a whole lot of flavor to be had. Might have just needed some more seasoning on the bacon or eggs. I have to say the same about the tater tots (which is a hilarious side item for breakfast). Bland, but they did offer ketchup so that helped. The coffee was good, standard.   They have an extensive menu of drinks that I'm looking forward to going back and trying including beer and (maybe?) wine. They have indoor and outdoor seating and good coffeehouse music to enjoy. A cool neighborhood place to grab a coffee and get some work done if you want to get out of the house or office."}
{"text":"This coffee shop/bar is just wonderful. The staff are the best. The drinks, coffee and mixed drinks are delicious and great. It is on the smaller side, so seating can be challenging if they are busy. They also have a patio that is nice to use when weather permits. They are pastries, and they also have food, sandwiches and soups and theh also have breakfast choices. Definitely a great spot to study, catch up with friends, or have a buainess meeting."}
{"text":"Formerly known as Dilworth Coffee, this coffee shop is a neat alternative to chain alternatives. The decor is warm and cozy, the music is very calm. I've actually studied here  . They use SpotOn Rewards  cards/keychain and the rewards come quickly! Some of my favorite specialty drinks are the caramel apple cider and the white hot chocolate ( which can be made with Almond milk). There's also I nice patio with lots of seating if you'd like to bring your four-legged friend."}
{"text":"Great staff, great drinks and love the wifi and patio! Hot, cold & alcoholic drinks; breakfast and lunch foods; fast wifi; clean and quiet atmosphere is everything I need in a strip mall that has everything else!"}
{"text":"The food and coffee are really good but the food is overpriced. I would eat there again if I had a craving but not regularly. I didn't get a chance to try their coffee alcoholic drinks. But I think it's a fun idea can't wait to try!!"}
{"text":"Great coffee and great atmosphere. I like that they added beer there. Great idea! They are always friendly and make a good cup o joe too!"}
{"text":"Friendly barista and very neatly decorated coffee shop. I had not tried Dilworth's that was here before prior to the rebranding but the barista said they use the same espresso so I cannot imagine it being much different in taste. I ordered a cappuccino and the foam was perfect but it doesn't taste much different from Starbucks."}
{"text":"the staff is super friendly and it's good energy to sit down and pretend like you're doing your schoolwork. which i didn't do but i thought about it"}
{"text":"First time here and I liked it!  Nice option and tad cheaper than Starbucks if you like that vibe!!!   Their lattes left a lil to be desired but not bad. Hubby had the house Kenya blend and we shared a hunk of fresh coffee cake which was moist lots of crumbles on top and quite tasty!   They offer 4 options plus the full speciality menu along with assorted pastries and a couple of breakfast sammies   The decor was  coffee house with lots dark wood, simple pendant lighting and cozy corners.  It also has nice patio as well."}
{"text":"Nice little coffee place. Got some pastries and alcohol too.  Spent a few hours sipping my cold coffee to which I added the vanilla flavor. Have ample seating space"}
{"text":"You ladies are superb!! Best customer service because I could tell they truly cared about our order and getting it right. Even the handing of our breakfast sandwiches to us was so nice and customer detailed. It wasn't just an... Eh, here ya go encounter. Even as I went back up to the counter to buy a water the barista had a smile on her face and went above and beyond."}
{"text":"Located in a strip mall, this coffee spot is pretty generic. It's kind of similar to Cafeccino; it could be located in any town without me noticing. I ordered a vanilla latte to go, price was reasonable and taste was predictable. There was nothing wrong with it but it also wasn't so good I'd go out of my way to come back here again. The place was clean and has ample space for someone to come and set up to work for a couple hours. With better coffee options in South Charlotte like Not Just Coffee and Hex, I'd go there instead. If a Starbucks opens up nearby, I hate to say it but this place wouldn't stand a chance."}
{"text":"I went in search hunting for a coffee shop that sells organic coffee , matcha or any other non dairy beverages. I wanted a break from Starbucks. I bet the coffees are very good , well my green tea latte was ok. And I took a chocolate brownie muffin. If you are looking for a high sugar kind of drinks or sweets/dessert, this place it is. My latte was too sweet and my muffin was so big, it was equivalent to a 1/4 kilo cake. Big piece!"}
{"text":"Cute little coffee shop that is now operating in the suite Dilworth Coffee used to be in. It is clean, organized, and the staff is always very nice. They have pastries available along with the coffee and tea menu.   I work night shift so when I have come in the store is fairly quiet due to it being the latter hours of operation. However, each time there have been one or more groups of studiers or socializing couples, etc.  I have gotten the Vanilla Chai Latte twice now. Every time I am working and happen to be in the area, I'll pick one up. It is always hot and has the perfect creamy blend of vanilla and spice with cute latte art on top :) I just have to say--this beats the chai latte at a Starbucks and I have ordered many of those in my day! Organic coffee options here also which is so great to see, always support organic when you can!   Great little spot if you're located in the neighborhood or passing through!"}
{"text":"I'm new to the neighborhood and recently had my first experience at Barista Craft. This little coffee shop is awesome! I ordered the chai latte and a slice of zucchini bread, and both were so good! I love that they have outdoor seating and plenty of parking. Additionally, I asked the barista some questions about the chai, and he was very knowledgeable. I will definitely be back to Barista Craft!  NOTE: They serve wine (and beer?) too, as well as other food options."}
{"text":"Mehhhhhhhh.  I work from home full time and am always on the hunt for a cool cafe to work from. I've always had groups of people who also telecommute, and we isuallh work from Starbucks and the like.  I was curious about this spot, and always prefer trying Mom n Pop shops over Starbucks, but this place was kind of a disappointment.   Pros: Cute decor Good wifi  Great customer service  Cons: -Not much that's healthy on the menu -Why on EARTH is a bagel sandwich 8.25? Apparently all they have is a meal, so It comes with a bagel, tater tots and a coffee. But I had just ordered a sandwich and latter, so I was charged for the coffee I didn't even drink. The sandwich was fresh, but pretty tasteless. The tater tots tasted like freezer burn. The cafe au lait I ordered was just okay.  Probably won't be back, if only for the sheer price of It. My total was $12, which is way more than I'm used to paying for a coffee shop breakfast."}
{"text":"There are always a number of people here when I visit, which is a testament to how great this place is. Coffee tastes fresh- good roast and not stale or burned, and there are some good flavor options, but the the coffee itself is still good on its own.  Atmosphere is cozy and clean- just eclectic enough for a classic coffeehouse feel without feeling dingy or cluttered.  There are not many local joints out this way, so fortunately they have some food and non-coffee options as well if you're trying to avoid the big chains (or you're looking for more than just java)."}
{"text":"I've visited this place a couple of times. The barista is always super friendly and willing to explain any of the coffee items in further detail, if needed. This quaint cafe is nice variation from the typically Starbucks' hustle and bustle, which is welcoming in the Highland Creek area.   However, my recent visit was a little disappointing. I arrived in time to try their lunch special and enjoy a cup of coffee. I ordered a Carmella which was good and a decent price ($3), but the grilled cheese and sun-chips combo ran me about $9.25 - not too impressive and had the price been displayed, I probably would have just went with a slice of banana nut bread instead.   Again, the cafe is a nice setup and good space to concentrate on work, as they offer free WiFi.I would visit this place again for a quick cup of coffee since it's close to my local Aldi."}
