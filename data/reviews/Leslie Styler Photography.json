{"text":"After our experience with Leslie, I sincerely hope we were a fluke and that she normally handles her business professionally. First, we were 10 min late because well...we have a newborn and a toddler and we're coming from across town. We didn't expect her to go past our end time because of this, but when we got there she said we were 30 min late (which we weren't) and that we needed to hurry since she had to pick her kids up from school. Again, we didn't expect her to go past our end time by 10 min since that's how late we were. Then, she didn't have her studio set up to take sibling pictures with my toddler and newborn. I had emailed her (like she asked in one of the numerous emails she sent me preparing for the session) telling her I have a toddler so we could do those pictures first so he wouldn't get cranky if we waited until the end.   We ended up w zero pictures of them together which is the most disappointing thing from all this. Her pushiness when we first walked through the door was what made us decide to move past sibling pictures. (This was after failing to get some with the poses she was trying to put my 18 month old in instead of just getting action shots of him interacting with her like I suggested) We didn't want to spend the whole time trying to get these pictures and get absolutely zero of my daughter by herself. Next, during the session my baby woke up and wouldn't go back to sleep (She is a good sleeper, too) because it was way way way too hot in her home studio. Leslie wanted me to keep feeding her and hoped she would fall asleep when I nursed her. The problem was, I was sweating and my baby was sweating so much she couldn't latch on and she was so hot she was uncomfortable thus not being able to fall back asleep. Since the day my baby was born, she would not fall asleep if she was too hot.  Because of this we asked Leslie to make it a little (just a little) cooler so we could get our baby comfortable enough to fall asleep yet Leslie didn't want to because she said she had enough experience to know that it wouldn't work. So, we went the rest of the session with my baby awake because she was too hot to fall asleep. I totally get that the studio was warm since my baby was in light wraps but it was excessively hot and obviously too hot for my baby.  Leslie should have taken into consideration when we asked for the air to be turned down that we, her parents, knew our baby well enough to know it was too hot.  After the session (3 weeks later) I emailed Leslie asking if there was any chance our gallery would be up sooner than 4 weeks. The time frame she gave us was 2-4 weeks and we assume that 4 is the max and if they could be completed earlier she'd do that; however, the response I got to that email was very rude and snarky.  She said I would have to pay $50 to get the pictures at 3 weeks (even though the time frame she gave us was 2-4 weeks) and that she had already offered to give me a few pictures in my gallery for a newborn announcement.  She did offer that but said I'd have to include those in the pictures I chose from the amount allowed in my package I paid for. I didn't want to do that since I wanted to see all of the pictures first. I didn't want to have to either pay extra for a picture I would want or sacrifice it since I already used up the amount of pictures I could choose.  The straw that broke the camel's back:  After we finally got our pictures I noticed that there were zero of our baby's features up close such as her lips, hands, feet, etc.  When I asked Leslie about this she stated that I did not request these; therefore, she did not provide them.  I was absolutely flabbergast by this.  At the beginning of the session she stated that she has specific poses she chooses to do for every baby and then would do any additional photos I wanted.  Naturally thinking with the hours we were there and that she has poses she always does first as well as the portfolio she has online (which I used to pick her as our photographer) that she did those up close pictures during that time.  She would not let us stand behind her to see any angle she was taking the pictures at nor did she show us all of the pictures before we left so we had no clue she hadn't taken any of these, and since she takes so long getting ANYTHING back to us there is no way I could get a different photographer or even her to get these once in a lifetime photos for us.  I will never be able to go back in time to get those precious pictures of my 1st born daughter at less than a week old. I think it is evident with this review, but I would never recommend her to anyone nor will we return to her.  Even after I pointed it out to her, she never apologized for her rudeness or that she didn't capture those missed pictures for us.  This review doesn't include everything we are unhappy with but I feel it captures the majority. I can't even put into words how upset I am that we didn't get the quality of photos we had hoped for."}

{"text":"Leslie Styler Photography has taken photos of my daughter that we will forever cherish- they look like a magazine advertisement! 

The studio was wonderful- full of every prop & wrap you could imagine! She was attentive, kind, and so personable! Worth every penny and then some!

The photos were so beautiful that when I needed a photo for my website- it was Leslie Styler Photography whom I trusted! She had a lighting setup like I have never seen- and was as expert at posing me as she is the newborns! I'm self conscious of my weight, and she was able to flatter me in nearly every photograph! You can see her 10 years of experience when you look at your gallery- her editing is ON POINT! I will post a photo so you can see the result! 

Don't hesitate- trust your most precious photography to Leslie Styler!"}
{"text":"I emailed this photographer to ask about time frames to book a newborn shoot. I was told to wait until about two months before my due date. When I emailed her, two months before my due date, I was told she was booked. It's very difficult to find a photographer on such short notice so I'm very disappointed."}
{"text":"I have worked with Leslie on 3 different sessions and she has done beautiful work on all 3. She was a pleasure to work with and always goes above and beyond to get us the best pictures! I look forward to working with her again!!"}
{"text":"I chose Leslie after searching for months for the perfect newborn photographer. I knew I would only have one opportunity to get professional photos of my newborn son and wanted someone who appreciated the innocence and simplicity of a newborn baby. I couldn't have been happier, my photos were absolutely beautiful. Leslie took photos of my son that I will cherish forever. They were perfect. He's 9 weeks old now and already it's hard for me to remember him being so small. I am grateful for choosing Leslie and for the beautiful photos she took of my son. I would absolutely recommend her and the investment was money well spent."}
{"text":"We LOVE the photos that Leslie has taken of our family over the years! She has such an amazing attention to detail and a beautiful classic style. We have photos from 2009 that look as if they were taken yesterday and still hang on our walls. 
She is so friendly, great with babies, and you can tell she has a passion for her work. She not only takes stunning newborn photos she also does an amazing job capturing older babies, children, and families. There were times during our last session where I was thinking there was no way we were going to get a good photo as much as my little one was moving and distracted but the results were somehow stunning! 
When she runs a special or opens up space for upcoming sessions grab a spot fast!

*update* just received prints from our last session  these are the highest quality prints we've ever had. Could not be more pleased with Leslie from booking to prints and everything in between. 

Thank you!"}
