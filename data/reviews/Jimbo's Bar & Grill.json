{"text":"Suppose to be a dive sports bar. If ur a metal or hard rock fan and try to play music on the jukebox,the owner has instructed the staff to skip it. They allow, classic rock, rap and country..if the bar is going to treat the customers like that then maybe he needs to specify that he runs a ghetto ass bar. The fact that I was told that I couldnt listen to what was on the jukebox was baloney. My friends play darts for this bar. The owner is an ass. He lost several customers tonight. And the fact that it was also my birthday too made things worse. Wouldn't recommend this bar."}
{"text":"FUN!  Friendly atmosphere... Facebook with beer... make friends you never knew ... Boarding House seating, find an empty stool and meet some folks. 

FREE Breakfast! not AN egg but 2-3 eggs, 2 sausage links, 2 bacon strips, hash browns and toast! All for the price of a drink.  Large mug of Beer, Bloody Mary, Screwdriver or Diet Soda any for $5 (hint: the soda has free refills) or anything else your morning taste-buds want.. Full bar. To top it off the guy taking food orders and probably delivering the food owns the joint!  Not many places have a truly hands-on owner that actually works!   

Done with Breakfast?  Stick around for Happy hour. Now a buffet with wings, nachos, and other goodies.  Menu varies per day. 

SPORT FANS!!   More TV's that Best Buy.  4 Roll-down projector TV's that cover 6 dart boards during football. Also more than a dozen HD big screens around the building! 

Pool Tables?  Yes. // Dart Board? Yes (see note above) // Shuffleboard?  Yep // Golden Tee?  YES! 

Staff is friendly even when busy. Sometimes patience is needed because the place stays packed!"}
{"text":"This place is the bomb. Free breakfast every day. It's a real breakfast too. 3 eggs, sausage, bacon, hash browns, toast. TVs everywhere. If you're still hungry, they'll give you another. Love this place."}
{"text":"Free breakfast everyday from 9am-noon. (With the purchase of a drink) 3 eggs, 2 bacon, 2 sausage, hash browns, and 2 pieces of toast. Good stuff. Can't beat the deals here. Worth your time!"}
{"text":"Went to Jimbo's for the first time this morning for breakfast with my 3 adult kids. The free breakfast was great! The bill for the 4 of us was $31.00 bucks. That is breakfast and 2 drinks each for four adults!

 The atmosphere was great along with the service. I never have done this but accidently walked out leaving my debit card on the table (I'm sure because of the 2 drinks I had lol) and our server came running out to catch me that alone sold me on this place!"}
{"text":"Love love love this place! Staff is friendly! Atmosphere is great! Lots of dart boards and a couple of pool tables... There is even a shuffle board. PLUS they offer FREE breakfast with a drink purchase! Can't beat that! Definitely worth a look!!"}
{"text":"I have been going to Jimbo's for years.  The staff is friendly.  The prices are competitive/fair. And free food with drink purchase (free breakfast 8a.m-12p.m. free wings 3p.m-6p.m) is a definite bonus! I've read the negative comments and I have never been treated that way. I would refer anybody to go. Jimbo's is a great, fun place that is clean with lots of big screens, 7 dart boards and plenty of seating. Also have 3 pool tables with a nice outdoor patio. And fyi a really hot and bad ass staff."}
{"text":"Great wings , and the breakfast is pretty good also .the Cook does a great job on the food . I don't drink so I can't say anything about that but over all a good neighborhood place ."}
{"text":"Absolutely and thank you for responding. The date of my visit was Saturday, August 8th. I can assure you that i am not exaggerating my experience! I have 15+ years restaurant experience and was appalled! Food safety is and always has been of utmost importance to me and it was far lacking during my visit. Im not sure if some of the employees aren't educated on food safety and sanitary procedures or if they don't care but it really made my experience quite uncomfortable. I left half of my beverage on the bar top and walled out in discust. I appreciate your response once again and hope you do look into the matter at hand."}
{"text":"Still serving breakfast for free with a drink purchase.. choose scrambled or over easy.. and they bring it to you.. great place and they do it until noon.. and can I mention they have a great pour for my taste.. ;)"}
{"text":"Worst breakfast,.  Eggs over cooked.  How do you overcook scrambled eggs?  Service average.  But you can't beat the price.  So in this case you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"The night started off great. The bartenders were exceptionally friendly and the prices were really good. 
My friends and I were having a great time until a biker dude asked my friend to take a photo with him. My friend was cool with it and noticed a knife in the biker's vest. When he asked if it was, in fact, a knife, the dude clocked him in the face. My friend didn't swing back, didn't yell at him, he just asked him what the punch was for. And guess what? Security told us that WE had to leave, even though we did absolutely nothing wrong. 
That pissed us all off because now we know where this place's morals are. I can assure you they never kicked out the guy who punched my friend because we came back to check and he was still there. We couldn't go back inside either. What a crock."}
{"text":"I love this place! Went with a group,  some of my friends,  not so nice, some of my friends, Nice ! If you treat them poorly,  you get treated poorly!  You treat them with respect,  you get respect! Awesome food, definitely good drinks!  Mimosa in a frosting mug!!!! (Lisa's way) ARE THE BEST! Awesome service!  Thanks for all the free food. Will be going back! Also I must say, I've been there in the morning for free breakfast,  and I've been there at night to get my thing on! Love both!"}
{"text":"HUGE Mimosas! Yummy free breakfast with beverage purchase.....doesn't get much better than that!!!!"}
{"text":"Great food but service sucks. Make sure you know what you want before the waitress comes because you won't see her for another 20 mins"}
{"text":"So much bigger than Jimbos was years ago ....tons of tv's lots of seating.  Had a good sized crowd for a Wednesday night only had a bartender and a waitress so both these girls ran their asses off but got the job done nobody looked like they lacked for anything .... Ill go back ...next time ill grab a bite."}
{"text":"Jimbos I love this place free breakfast ,awesome to watch sports. I usually get waited on Sierra awesome waitress . I love that when I go in she brings my drink and food without asking ,she already knows our order."}
{"text":"This is my utopian place to chill, either playing pool or darts or just hanging with Rickboy and the gang.   Thanks Jimbos for constantly reminding me of a little piece of home every time I come! Our famous saying at home is two words.... Jim   bos!"}
{"text":"This place is a must go for breakfast. $5 for your drink of choice and you get a huge breakfast included all for the same $5! Forget Denny's 2,4,6,8. This place has Bloody Mary's, and huge Mimosas!"}
{"text":"what happened to this place ? The wings are still pretty good, but the service the past two times has been horrible. I usually sit at a table and not the bar,  so I can't speak about the bartenders. The waitresses at night are the ones that have left a bad taste in my mouth. Me and my wife will find a new place for wings and a game because we had such bad experiences with the rude waitresses that take forever to come and give you a million excuses as to why they forgot about you ."}
{"text":"Love this place!, Lisa our waitress was very polite,and hr customer service was great! She answered any questions that we may have had.The wings were the bomb! I ordered them extra crispy,and buy god they were!and tasted great!the sauce was good not a over powering vinegar taste like most places when they try to get them hot.Now there hot was not hot! But a good taste,I took my two daughters,5 and 7 yrs old and they enjoyed themselves very much twirling in circles on the seats,.and eating the huge chicken fingers,there food is pretty big  so two people could share it to save a little money,drinks were all 5.00 dollars and then you got free food! From the buffet ,My wife ordered the wine burger,which she liked very much she said.We will  be going back, The free wings start at 3:00 till 6:00 or 7:00pm and  breakfast starts at 8am till noon, which is also free with a drink.I'm not a drinker,so I had one drink which was good enough for me.Thanks Lisa for all your help and the way you treated us.so Sunday football here we come,our new neighborhood place to enjoy ourselves!"}
{"text":"Free breakfast with the purchase of a drink. We went on a Sunday morning, order a bloody mary and they give you a choice of either scrambled or regular fried eggs, hashbrowns, sausage and bacon. Come to find out they do free breakfast everyday. My wife had a mimosa and our bill was $13. Apparently they have crazy happy hour specials too."}
{"text":"Ok so they have free wings that they bring around while you sit and drink.  The onion rings are pretty good.  The atmosphere on the other hand...leaves much to be desired.  It is like a tavern in the inside...at least what I would imagine a tavern looks like.  Lots of mirrors, very dark, no windows, smells like old cigarettes...need I say more?   Upon arrival you are greeted, wait no, stared at by the locals out smoking in front of the entrance.  They give you the \"you 'ain't from around here\" look...and they are right....I am not!  

I do have to say the place was really busy!  Lots of beer choices which is great.  All in all, atmosphere is important to me and I have to say that it ruined my opinion of this place."}
{"text":"I love coming here in the morning Jim has the best breakfast in town. Not only is it free with any drink purchase, but the food is awesome. The bar is big and has lots of TV'S , pool tables, Darts, and yep a shuffleboard. I brought my cousin here today Joe a celebrity. So that he could see the best breakfast spot in the valley.   TKS JIM!"}
{"text":"Checked out Jimbo's, having heard of the good wings to be had. We were not disappointed. This is a good basic, dark, non-pretentious bar in a small strip-mall. A local's hangout. A couple of pool tables, a wall of dartboards and plenty of tv's showing various sports. Our margaritas were simple, basic and tasty but nothing overly fancy. The wings come with a variety of flavors served regular or extra crispy and are a must-try. They're advertised as dozen but it sure felt like quite a bit more on the plate, though we didn't take the time to count, just enjoyed 'em. We'll be back for more. The staff was friendly, attentive and just plain cool. If you're looking for a simple place to hang out, grab a few drinks and get some grub, check out Jimbo's."}
{"text":"Good sevice, free breakfast. Reasonable prices.   However,  I have been here many times and it's always too hot inside! It's cooler outside on some days!"}
{"text":"Great place to have a beer, free breakfast, and watch a game.  I love going here and playing darts.  Staff knows me on a first name basis and remembers what I drink.. Kudos to a great local bar"}
{"text":"Ok, so for those of you who know me you know I don't frequent bars (of any kind) rarely drink and pretty much stay to myself. Found out Dwight Knox is the new owner here and last night we were talking about the FREE breakfast he serves Everyday. I was helping my sister out this morning and decided to stop by. Holy cow! This is amazingly good. All the games on clear TV and yes and the place was jumping! Doing a good thing Dwight! Keep up the good work.  Former Moon Valley and Apollo Alum are the owners!"}
{"text":"Great place to gather with family and friends!  Jumbo's offers an amazing breakfast.  Definitely an awesome hangout."}
{"text":"This is a racist establishment. Last night my brother got kicked out of the bar for not having his ID,which is a completely legitimate reason. But the way the situation was handled was completely ridiculous. I was already at the bar with my friend and my brother's wife. We had a waitress, she had already carded us and brought us drinks. Our waitress knew that my brother was not going to have his ID because his wife had told her. So when my brother arrives she completely disappears. After like 10 minutes the biggest white dude in the bar comes over and stands right by my brother and starts demanding that we all show him our IDs or get up and get out of the bar. My brother told him he didn't have his ID but didn't want to leave so the guy goes and gets the owner. The owner starts giving us some ridiculous speech about how there might be a sting operation and the cops might show up and ask for everyone's ID and if that happens he'll get fined and all this bullshit. And this whole time our waitress never came to the table and just ask my brother for his ID like she should have, because she was scared because my brother is 350 lbs and he's big and black. So she sent that fuckin kid over there and he came over acting like he was a fuckin cop at a goddamn traffic stop. Half of the people at the table were already drinking when that stupid little retard came over there so there was no reason for him to demand everyone's ID like he was in fuckin charge or something. The whole place is bullshit and I honestly hope they get shut down. They never should have sold that new owner. Also when I tried to bad mouth them on Facebook and tag them in it they reported the thread to get it deleted."}
{"text":"Where else can you have a giant mimosa 3 eggs toast sausage and bacon and the best hash browns ever alll for 5 dollars?
No where.  Cooked to order
Fast service..perfect place to go after a hike 5 star s"}
{"text":"Been there a couple times.  It's you average hole in the wall location.  Good service, cheap drinks, and friendly people.  If you get there before 12pm (ish) you Can get a free breakfast.  Nothing fancy. 3 eggs (scramble or over easy), toast, hash browns, bacon and sausage with a purchase of a drink."}
{"text":"Pretty cool unassuming little bar tucked into a small strip mall next to a giant flower shop. Been by it on the Canal Trail for the past decade, but never stopped in until recently. 

Great dartboards. A bit quirky and some accuracy issues with scoring, but fun to play on.

Lots of nice TVs with all sorts of games and some pretty obscure glue stick/horse races. 

Not a whole lot of beers on tap. Most of their selections are in bottles, which is kind of a bummer. No real drink specials to speak of, either. 

Service is solid. The girls behind the bar are friendly, efficient and attentive. Checked up on us several times, and brought drinks quickly. Dig it. 

Food is meh. I think they do a lot of free stuff at certain times of day, but what we ordered was average at best, and a bit pricier than it should be. 

Overall, a very good place to play a few games after work, and easy access off the Canal Trail. Good service, but food and drink value isn't particularly good."}
{"text":"Ordered extra crispy plain wings and Drew hooked it up.  Deeeeeeeelicious! Bartender Trisha was friendly and quick with a great attitude! Love this place!"}
{"text":"This used to be my favorite spot but after a few negative experiences I stopped coming in. Gave it another try with my friend and Chelle totally changed our views of this place! She's a doll and works really hard. We will definitely be back and made sure to find out when she works so we can come back to see her!"}
{"text":"Anywhere that gives you a free breakfast with the purchase of a drink at 8 am is all right in our eyes. Let me say the food wasn't great but it was FREE! We couldn't believe this place was packed at 830 am on a Saturday morning.  A fun hole in the wall."}
{"text":"I've been here several times with the old owner who now owns Finishline. Great place. I've been twice since the new owner, still great. Service is perfect even when the place is packed, food is great and prices are quite fair. Do yourself a favor... Try to sit in Trixie/Tina's section. Can't go wrong with her."}
{"text":"Ok so at first I thought it was a little sketchy. But it's clean fun and cheap.... I had a blast there. It's such a fun dive bar."}
{"text":"Cool bar environment, great vibe, decent priced drinks, HORRIBLE SERVICE!!!!!.I went here yesterday for the first time. Sat down at the bar near the pool tables and took out my wallet and ID and put my hands on the top of the bar(showing I was reading to purchase alcohol). Took the bartender almost 8 minutes to noticed I was there, even tho she passed me a few times. My bartender was wearing a black shirt, had dark brown hair and glasses. After I finished my drink I set it in front of me(showing I'm down with my drink) and it took her another 8 mins or so to ask me for another one. She stayed on the other side of the bar the entire time. The only reason she seemed to noticed I needed another drink is when she was cashing out the guy next to me I made it obvious that I needed another drink. After finishing that drink I set my glass in front of me again and this time after waiting maybe 11 mins she walked to the back. I waited another 4 mins then left after I got annoyed of waiting for her to come back. I know the time of all this because when I first got there I was watching the Hockey game and was keeping an eye on the time and after my second drink I set it in front of me and went to the jukebox I put on 5 songs and I was able to listen to all of them before I left. I liked this bar and thought it was a nice place to drink but however I will NEVER return because I do not want to be served by this bartender ever again. I didn't even get a chance to tip because I was paying as I go and on my last drink I was going to put a tip on the check but seeing I didn't want to wait almost 20mins for a drink I ended up leaving. I work at a bar as a barback, I understand if you get busy and distracted but serving one side of the bar constantly and ignoring the other side is unacceptable. Also the females had their purses on the middle bar island and that look very tacky."}
{"text":"My first time here and I would love to go back. First of all. The mermosa was delicious and giant then to top it off you get a breakfast with any beverage order. What a great deal. I was expecting the food to not taste that good. But when I got it I enjoyed every bite. Could not even finish it because they give you so much."}
{"text":"Heard of this place from many people, finally stopped by for brunch with a coworker. No disappointments at all except that I had to return to work."}
{"text":"Free Breakfast!!! Yeah it is hard to beat that but it's still a dive bar. Pretty dark inside. Let's just say it's the perfect place on a Saturday morning if you want the hair of the dog that bit you."}
{"text":"All I can say is don't waste your time. Whatever this place used to have, it doesn't anymore. Clean sports bar with lots of TVs. Don't bother with the food. Frozen fish fillets for the fish and chips, with bagged French fries. Fish sticks were gummy and very breaded. Nothing is homemade. Very disappointed and hungry after my meal."}
{"text":"Best Breakfast deal in Arizona! Buy any drink (alcoholic or non) for $5 and you get a free plate of breakfast. The food is pretty good too. Perfect breakfast after a night of partying."}
{"text":"There have been posts about Jimbos being racist and I can't agree with that. I go to Jimbos and I'm white and I am carded every time. They know who I am, but they card me every time because that is policy. I used to be a bartender and you can get in big trouble if you don't card someone at a bar. Here's a solution: have your ID and it's no issue. They also have a sign on the door saying to have your ID ready. People getting angry about them being racist have no reason to say that. I have watched the bartenders card all kinds of races, so just have your ID and get over the fact that they are doing their jobs. Period. #ignorantpeople"}
{"text":"New owner and staff are super personable and very welcoming. Haven't been here in a while, but glad I made the choice to stop by."}
{"text":"Have been coming to this bar for years now, I must say it's had such an improvement!! I love what they've done with the bar. The food is also excellent, I highly recommend the wings!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here for a couple football Sundays this season, and had a couple different experiences.  This first time was good, our waitress was attentive.  We ordered an appetizer sampler than was more than enough for 4 people (though I might have exceeded my cheese curd quota for some time).  In addition to the free wings in the afternoon this place seemed like a keeper.  The second trip was a little different.  Had to hunt for our waitress just to get a drink, and they arbitrarily chose not to do the free wing promo that day because \"they kitchen was busy\", even though the place seemed no busier than previous visits.  That left a bad taste with us, but maybe we'll be back to see if that was just a minor hiccup in what was an otherwise decent dive bar."}
{"text":"Smells like piss.  Free breakfast.  Eat free in a catbox.  Decide.  Very dark and scary inside with no windows.  Everything is sticky.  The restroom doors are always open and it's just a large trough filled with ice.  There are dart boards.  To recap, smells like catbox, free breakfast, pee on ice, then throw darts."}
{"text":"Jimbo's is just ok for me. 

PROS: 
Good prices on drinks and food.
Shuffleboard table
Darts
Big Screen TVs

CONS:
Very LOUD! The music is way too loud and makes it hard to chat with friends.
Often has strange people - not sure what it is but I always seem to encounter at least one crazy person every time I am there
OK service but sometimes slow. The servers are super nice - you just have to wait a bit sometimes.

It is a place to go once in a while for a hole-in-the-wall neighborhood bar with good prices but not necessarily someplace I would go when planning a night with friends who I want to be able to chat with."}
{"text":"The clientele did not make me feel safe, and not even 5 minutes in a drunk man falls from his chair and hits his head on one of the seats very hard. Nobody cared to help and the recommendation was to have him drink som more. Honestly he should have been cut off. Nobody took our order after we asked for service and we bounced after 15 minutes. I'd rather go to Applebee's than come here again."}
{"text":"They have the best \"FREE\" breakfast in town! Just need to buy a drink alcohol or non! Also have the cleanest restrooms for all the sports bars in town!!"}
{"text":"Awesome dive/sports bar! Great place to cure a hangover w a Bloody Mary & FREE breakfast. Tons of fun! Could be a pinch cleaner but it doesn't bother me."}
{"text":"Five star \"Dive Bar\"!!!! Beer $1. Seven and seven $5.  Breakfast.  Free. Hair of the dog...  Priceless!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Free breakfast or free booze!? Either way..... #winning!"}
{"text":"LOVE the breakfast here. Best deal in town. Taste and quality, spot on. Service is a little sketchy / hit or miss. Recently went for the wings in the evening. Awesome service, awesome deal ( as good as the breakfast deal) Great quality and flavor. Will definitely be back for the wings!  Super divey but totally worth it!!"}
{"text":"Been There 3 times now.. This is a really fine community Sports Bar & Grill.  Definitly a Locals Favorite and all 3 times the crowd was Fun & Mixed; mixed Age Group also.. Talking to the Waitresses and my buddy who took me there the frist time, most have been working there since for the past 2-3 years and that's a good sign. I CANNOT see how ANYBODY can complain about the prices!  Plus the \"old style\" Happy Hour.  1-3pm Beer's are a BUCK!  3-6 or 7(I forget) FREE Happy Hour Layout? Who does that anymore in Phoenix:  Wings, Chili they make  (I'm told) and Sweedish Meatball! The happy hours prices were mixed.. They were something like $2, $4 & $5 HOWEVER I DO NOT REMEMBER!  I Could be wrong: Call & Find out.  Also, this is off the Hook:  In the mornings (Weekends but call and check for days, I think 7 days a week) FREE BREAKFAST WITH ONE DRINK:  A Regular Sit Down Breakfast with Eggs, Potatos, Saugage & Bacon, Toast? -- I HAVE NOT been there yet fior this but I'm told they literally just serve everybody automatically:  All you can Eat.  AT NIGHT AFTER 10PM:  $3 YOU CALL \" EVERYTHING \"  My buddy gets Tangaray's!   Beers, you name It, it's $3!   So who ever said in that other review that Jimbo's is really expensive, I'd have to ask what town is he talkin' about!  My favorit part of it was the friendly and Mixxed Crowd.  There were 20somthings all over. Ther were baby boomers and I saw people hookin' up.  Outside Smoking area.  I mean,  I dig Salty's in Glendale/Arrowhead and lot's of places around the greater city.  Toby Keiths in Mesa for Country, Killer Food & Music if you like Country.  Jimbo's is right up there on the West Side for the Sports Crowd.  Killer big screens and the small one's you'd expect.  I thought it far \"Warmer\" then, say, Santori Brothers on Bell & the 17 (name) in the Bell Canyon strip mall... And it's in a great part of town!  Enjoy"}
{"text":"This place is pretty good busy on sunday morning. Free breakfast. Clean lots of tv dart boards. Miss the free chicken wings. Cant bitch about the free breakfast though."}
{"text":"Breakfast anyone? Love the breakfast cocktails and complementary breakfast! Great stop any day of the week! Friendly people and super nice staff! A true treasure tucked in a strip mall! One of our favorite stops!"}
{"text":"Wow...  Free breakfast with a drink?  Amazing.  The Bloody Mary was spicy yet flavorful.  The breakfast reminded me of mama's cookin' mm mmmm delish.  I love how the only two options are scrambled or over easy!  The bikers with cuts in the bar were a bit scary, but honestly everyone was way friendly.  Lots of TVs all over for your viewing pleasure.  I definitely will be back.  Go Cardinals!"}
{"text":"Just moved here from Washington. This bar is only a three minute drive from my new apartment and I am truly lucky! 
For the cost of a drink, $5, you get a free breakfast from 8am in noon. It consists of hash browns, toast, eggs, bacon and sausage! It's a sweet deal. 
My roommate and I have being going frequently the last two or three weeks. Both in the mornings as well as at night! The bartenders and cooks are wonderful. Made us feel very comfortable. I more so focus on the drinks rather than the food at night but I've heard very good things.
Jukebox, two pool tables, an open kitchen and a wall of dartboards.
Blessed to have found this place so close to home."}
{"text":"This is your regular North Side run down divey sports bar, except It smells weird and I always get severely congested in there.(I wonder if they have a mold problem.) It's a  really big place, there is a wall of TVs and it's usually pretty full. Also, they serve free hot wings during happy hour, so if you're into that...

I don't like it, because I don't like sports and I like background music when I'm drinking. Plus I've seen some obnoxious drunks in there and never anyone slightly hip, which is fine, but... well, it is what it is.

I would give 2 or 3 stars, but often the bartenders have attitude. No matter how friendly I am or how much I try to get on their good side with good tips, asking them how they are doing, etc. they still kind of act rude. There's one girl in particular, but I can't remember her name. She wears glasses, has dark hair and is pale. She will purposely ignore me and help all the men at the bar instead. 

It may be a silly gripe, but that's  the reason I haven't gone back. I like friendly neighborhood places."}
{"text":"Went here with no expectations a other than to get a drink with some work peeps after a meeting we had downtown. I order my kilt lifter and the waitress says, \"how would you like your eggs?\" I'm like what? We all got free breakfast just by ordering a three dollar pint! Fuckin crazy in this day in age of greedy folk. The breakfast was bomb. Eggs, hashbrowns, sausage, bacon and toast. When your done, they ask ask if you would like another plate! It really is good by the way. Waitress, susan, awesome as well. Make it a point to at least try it. My bill was 3 dollars and i left full and happy."}
{"text":"Went here this morning for breakfast because my friend said it was free with a drink purchase. Breakfast was decent, drinks were fine, BUT there was a waitress that ruined it. We were across the bar and we could hear her saying \"SHUT UP! Shut the fuck up! SHUT UP! OMG SHUT UP!\" *all very high pitched annoying girl voice\"... Don't get me wrong, she wasn't being confrontational. Even worse, she was saying it like a stuck up annoying 19year old. We left in 20 minutes, won't go back."}
{"text":"Awesome Bar and Chill down to Earth Atmosphere  Love the breakfast  only one flaw  No cheese"}
{"text":"I belong to a dart league sponsored by Jimbos. The bar staff was excellent. The drink prices were on par and the captain and coke was good. 

They were offerig free food for the Thursday night football. Wings, chili and meatballs. I only had the wings and they were great. (free)

There were plenty of TV's to watch the games and they even have pull down screens to add a few more."}
{"text":"That place is very, very dark but the beer mugs are big and cold! lol. The service was good and their BLT was yummy, plus they give you a BIG portion of fries. I was bummed that I was there during the wings and onion rings but didn't get any. Boo!! Maybe next time :)"}
{"text":"The good: price is right, & the wine burger was good.  
The bad: the cook threw my food down and had his back to me before I could ask for condiments, napkins, and silverware.
The fries were over cooked.

Also, personal pet peeve... when I go to a sports bar, and there are multiple games on, those games should be on.  Had to ask to put games on.

Seems like a good place for regulars, not so much for first timers."}
{"text":"Awesome wings! Love this place. And the owner koda cool too...haha....best bar for football!!!! Hands down"}
{"text":"Typical local bar. Free breakfast n weekends with a drink purchase. 3 eggs, 2 each bacon and sausage, 2 toast and potatoes. Service great. Not been here other than weekends. Trish (bartender) is SMOKIN HOT and a damn nice ass. Wish I was inher league."}
{"text":"Great people, great food. Reasonable drink prices. This place is great. Best people and unbelievable food. Get the burger. Wineburger with bacon and cheese. U R welcome!!"}
{"text":"Friends called me yesterday afternoon and asked me to stop and have a beer with them and watch the ALCS game.  Sort of a cool neighborhood bar with a small bar food menu.  Most of the patrons seemed to know each other or were in small groups at a single table like we were.  I counted 7 screens but I forgot to see if there were any over by the pool tables.  4 pool tables, 7 dart boards, shuffleboard and a couple of video games.  The tables and stools are all anchored.  The door has been replaced with a privacy wall in the men's room and the one stall looks like the door has been removed and replaced a few times.  The padded rails on the tables need reupholstering.  Overall the place seems in pretty good shape.  They have a fenced in smoking patio but I didn't see any chairs or tables on it.

I had a toasted ham and cheese on sourdough ($5.75)and I chose to have it with onion rings, although I could have chosen fries or cottage cheese.  It was good and I thought a pretty good deal.  I had MGD long necks at $3 each.  Not sure if that was happy hour or regular price, I didn't ask.  

All the employees I dealt with were pleasant and efficient.  I Left by 7 so I don't know if the vibe changes as the evening goes on.  I noticed several folks just like me that joined friends and left after a drink or two.  I had a good time with friends and wouldn't hesitate to go back again.

The woman opening up early Saturday sure looked at me funny taking pictures of the place as she walked up to the door. :-)"}
{"text":"Great place to meet up with your friends.  Good pours, great prices and a free breakfast if you are interested.  I think my only problem with this place is I sat at the bar and noticed that the wait staff fills up your glasses of water from the sink faucet not the gun at the bar. My friend asked about it and she said, it's the owner and there he is right there if you want to bring it up with him."}
{"text":"My favorite bar. Great staff, good food...AWESOME wings!!! I always tell people to go here. I hadn't been in a couple of mths and when I went in again, they had remodeled and made it more open. Love it!"}
{"text":"New owners changing it up. Its a chill spot ,good wings and a lot of TVs. I liked the older days better."}
{"text":"The drinks are watered down. If you like to order an additional shot for your drink this is the place. I gave it two chances and both times the same issue."}
{"text":"Wonderful and timely service! I love the atmosphere! The food, the drinks, and the price are unbeatable! Love going in the morning for the tasty free breakfast with a purchase of a drink (So $5 for a drink and breakfast). Love going at night for shuffle board, darts, and pool! Highly recommended for a laid back bar scene :)"}
{"text":"The very first time I was there was so great. We had beer and wings....perfect.... fast forward to staff drama and cross contamination.... OMG.... smoking outside without washing hands....dropping raw food in the fryer and on the grill with no hand washing.... saw ONE pair of gloves....and Zero hands washed.... When I asked about it, I got WAY too much attitude.... staff battles we're VERY UNCOMFORTABLE....... It was fun when the sisters we're there....they take time off...Horror!"}
{"text":"This place is great! For $5 you get an adult beverage and a huge breakfast, 3 eggs, bacon, sausage, hash browns and toast The bloody Mary and food  are delish! Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Another awesome time! Free breakfast and generous pours! Definitely a fun place to hang out"}
{"text":"Disclaimer: I have only been here for weekend breakfast. If you are looking for a low key breakfast spot, this is it! With the purchase of a beverage, the breakfast is free. You read it right, FREE! Breakfast consists of eggs (scrambled or over easy), hash browns, bacon, sausage and toast. If you want something else, go somewhere else. I was beyond pleased with the meal and a delicious Bloody Mary for a $5 total. Open seating, dive bar atmosphere, fast & friendly service every time. Don't forget to tip your servers generously - you're still saving money here!"}
{"text":"You cannot go wrong. Jimbo's is simply amazing. Staff is always friendly. Food is great and drinks are the best. I love how I can walk in and the bartender already knows how to make my drink. As far as the free breakfast. You couldn't ask for anything more. Buy a drink, get a full breakfast with all the trimmings."}
{"text":"Been there a few times. Easy place to stop by and have food and drinks. This place has Darts and pool tables.  

I've have nachos and they are great for sharing. We have also had chicken tenders and they are good as well. The bartender Tom (I believe that his name) is an older man and he is really cool. It amazes me how they use Post-its to keep track of everything."}
{"text":"We just love this place! Best breakfast in town and it comes with a cocktail  Great atmosphere and great food!
Family friendly as well!!"}
{"text":"It's such a shame when people are just blatantly racist it's a shame and it's sad and people should not have to go do that especially when they're out trying to enjoy family time i liked the old management better. #jimbosisracist"}
{"text":"Ordered eggs over easy, got them over rock hard. Cold hash browns. Then, just when I thought everything was perfect, they tell me they gave my debit card to the wrong person and they've already left. Wonderful lack of service and what little service you get is crap-ola! Don't waste your time unless you're just there to drink and ALWAYS pay in cash."}
{"text":"Fun place to go for some drinks. Good music nice employees. I would go back on a Saturday night. Sometimes it gets crowded but that makes it fun."}
{"text":"Jimbos is always a fun bar to go to. After 9pm drinks are $4. While the place isn't huge is does have 2 pool tables, about 7 dartboard, several tv's, a touch tunes jukebox, and an outside smoking area. The staff is always friendly and when they recognize you as regulars they really make sure to take care of you.

The pool tables are about $.75 to a $1 a game (can't remember which while darts are about the same depending on the game you choose. The dartboard are better dartboards that never seem to have challenges, have many game types, are able to be set up for league play, and even allows you to play against people in other areas across the world. 

A big shout out to Sabrina, Shelly, and the rest of the crew at Jimbos. Thanks for keeping it fun and making Jimbos my and my girlfriend's  bar of choice."}
{"text":"Come for the free breakfast, stay cause you shouldn't be driving in your condition anyways!  Place is dark, with typical \"less than fresh\" bar odor, but has friendly staff and a ton of TVs.  It's fine for what it is (a place to drink), but I wouldn't bring anyone here on a first date."}
{"text":"This may literally be the BEST SPORTS BAR/TV set-up ANYWHERE IN PHOENIX!  60\" Sharp HDTVs behind every inch of the bar, 5 HDTV projection screens (probs 100\"), free wings(!), free breakfast(!) cheap drinks!"}
{"text":"First experience. Great food, great service, and great value. 

I had burger and we shared the sampler appetizer.

Played darts and just had a great time. We will be back"}
{"text":"Buy a drink and get a free breakfast?! 

I'M IN!! 

My friend mentioned Jimbo's over drinks one night. She mentioned there was a bar that offered free breakfast with the purchase of a drink. ANY kind of drink. Soda, Coffee, shots of Whisky, Champagne...WHATEVER!!

Jimbo's is a bar with several dart boards, a juke, M&M machines, dollar change machine and other odds and ends. Waitress arrives at your table in minutes and asks 2 questions. \"What would you like to drink and how would you like your eggs cooked?\" I always order Champagne with a shot of Jager and sunny side up. Breakfast always arrives within minutes of placing your order and the drinks seconds before that! It comes with: Sausage, Bacon, 2 eggs, a huge serving of hash browns and toast.The breakfast is along the lines of a greasy spoon diner. Don't expect anything fancy.

Service is always good. Kids are allowed during breakfast hours of 8am-12pm. It turns back into a bar as soon as breakfast is over. Plenty of parking out front. Condom machine in the women's restroom. It get's pretty packed, so there might be a little wait if you plan on going with a big party."}
{"text":"In town for a fun weekend and a buddy took me here for a morning cocktail and a bit of food. The free breakfast with your purchase of a drink is awesome. The menu is simple and to the point. \"Scrambled or regular eggs\" and you get a big helping of hash browns, toast, sausage and bacon. Drinks were strong and crowd was good. 4 stars. Service could have been a bit faster. Overall highly suggest this place if you are looking for a quick drink!"}
{"text":"HUUUUUGE wings! Wow! Been there 3x in 2 weeks and will be back again! Took some friends in there for wings and we all had to have to go boxes the wings are that big and delicious. Friendly bartender and lots of fun! ~Buffalo Rick~"}
{"text":"This place is excellent! Love meeting friends here after a long night at work. Can not beat the service everyone is friendly and nice. The breakfast and drink deal is the best in town. The food is awesome!"}
{"text":"Jimbo's is a sports bar that is not too fancy but not too divey. It's a nice place to go and get some well priced drinks and food. They offer free breakfasts on Sat mornings with alcohol, also their happy hours includes free food. The food is not gourmet, but it does the trick. Beer is well priced, mixed drinks are about average. There is plenty of darts and 3 pool tables. It is clean and the bar staff has always been friendly. A good place to hang!"}
{"text":"Excellent place to chill, the owner is legit as f*ck. Love hanging out here! So fun! The bartenders are great, love that I can take my beer out while I have a smoke. Favorite bar on the west side :)"}
{"text":"This place is dark, no windows and feel like some strip club in south Phoenix. If they had better lighting in this place they won't have to post a sign asking for ID. Also bartenders should have common sense before asking. I have been in the industry long enough to know if someone is young or not. I wouldn't come back here again if your paid me"}
{"text":"Jimbos is the place to be. Shelley and Stephanie will take care of you and keep your glasses full. The food is awesome and the atmosphere is laid back. They have tons of Tv's and all the sporting events. Definitely my favorite spot in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"My coworker invited me out to eat breakfast here with a few others. Every day until 12pm, you can get free breakfast with a purchase of an adult beverage. (Not 100% sure if it's only adult beverages or any type of beverage).

For $5 I got a huge delicious mimosa & a breakfast plate that comes with hashbrowns, 3 eggs (your choice of scrambled or over easy), 2 strips of bacon, 2 sausage links & buttered toast! 

That's a deal! Service is great here. Bartenders are quick with the drinks and wait staff is always on top of their game. It gets pretty busy in here as well. 

It is pretty dark in here, like really really dark. You eyes adjust to it after a while but be careful going into the bright sun after leaving this place haha. They have a few pool tables and some darts on their back wall. A couple tv's showing different sports and sometimes news or talk shows."}
{"text":"This place is good for drinks! But I wouldn't want to order food here. Behind the bar, they have a open kitchen. While I'm sitting at the bar drinking, what caught my attention are the cookers. Just too many health code violations. They do not even wear gloves to cook, just their bare hands touching your foods and you're putting it in your mouth and eating it!! Just be aware if you order food here! Again, drinks are great for their prices!"}
{"text":"This is a great dive bar. The price is reasonable and they have darts games. You'll have a fun time with either playing pool, darts, or catching up with some friends. The only thing is that they don't carry top shelve liquor. Or else I'll give it a 5 star."}
{"text":"One of my favorite dive bars!  Pool, darts, shuffle board etc.  Great juke box!  Bar food is really good actually.  Everyone is very friendly as well!"}
{"text":"Jimbo's is a good neighborhood bar.  They have lots of dart machines, pool tables, and a shuffleboard.  The beer selection wasn't too large but they were decently priced and from 10pm until 1am you call it's are $3.00."}
{"text":"This is usually an awesome bar, but this last time it was a bad experience. My fiancé sat at the bar for a good 15min without any acknowledgement whatsoever. Two waitress could've helped us but just looked right through us as we weren't even there."}
{"text":"Good size neighborhood bar, kind of dark, but welcoming. Yes, they do have wifi. Ask for the password.  From my seat at the bar I could see fourteen TV screens, all showing sports.  There are three pool tables, and eight dart boards. 

Waitresses are cute.  And OMG they have hard cider in tap!  

I just stopped in for lunch and it wasn't loud music at all, just background music.  It was a Tuesday and the place was surprisingly well attended for a Tuesday lunch time.  Nice little place. I will go back."}
{"text":"Scary place...friendly service and patrons. 
Been here at least 10 times and every single time some other patron starts up a conversation.
If you don't want to be social, don't go here. 
Food is good, prices are good, atmosphere is dark and sometimes very loud, but overall, a nice neighborhood watering hole.

Its always packed, so they must be doing something right.

BTW- don't park nearby where the amateur drunk patrons can side swipe your brand new truck and then just drive-off like the chicken-sh!t worthless scumbags they are."}
{"text":"Best jukebox box on this side of town.  I used to just come for breakfast but turns out its a great late night too."}
{"text":"The outside will fool you. This place is very modern and lively. 
Staff is friendly
Lots of TVs and dart boards. 
Beer a great price. Better than other places
The food is on the pricey side. Better offer elsewhere for the same quality."}
{"text":"Huge disappointment we came to jimbos expecting our great wings and great service unfortunately we found out on the smoking patio dave sold..now new owners. We had to contact our waitress twice within two hours and we had to wait 30 minutes for a delivery of food and drinks! then when the manager( short hair blonde) on January 2nd 10:15 in the evening came and offered us a free drink we said no thank you we probably won't be back she walks away and so so instead of trying to discuss what the problems are here... she dismisses our discussion and walks away saying WOW! I do not recommend Jimbo's as the neighborhood neighborhood bar! Huge disappointment we came to Jimbo's expecting a great Wings and great service.. unfortunately we found out the opposite... not to mention the tremendous increase in food and drinks...so sad! Read reviews good ones from before new management!"}
{"text":"I love this place, I have only come a few times but, my best friend is there once or twice a week. The drinks are great and the other night I had the fried pickles and O.M.G! They were PERFECT! I haven't heard of anything that was less than great! It's a chill yet upbeat place you can definitely come here to Unwind after a long day @ work, I haven't come on a weekend or Friday yet so I can't speak on that! The staff is all great as well!"}
{"text":"Coolest spot in Glendale to grab a drink. Very professional staff, decent drink prices and the icing on the cake. . Free breakfast with the purchase of a drink! This place deserves a 6th star."}
{"text":"allways go in the morning! order a drink get free breakfast.....  9-12"}
{"text":"This place has been here forever. I've been more times then I can count. It sucks every time. I could go on but I don't have the energy to complain just like I don't understand why I keep trying this place."}
