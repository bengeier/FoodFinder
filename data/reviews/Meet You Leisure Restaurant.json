{"text":"Decent but nothing stellar; decor is kept pretty much the same as the unit that used to be in its place. Got a chilled tea which was quite flavourful and not too sweet.

The only complaint is that the servers should probably be a tad more considerate when giving change in smaller denominations so one can actually choose how much tips to give rather than being forced to give way too much tips for them practically just giving you a drink in a takeaway cup...

If you do go, I suggest debit in this case! 

Otherwise, nice atmosphere"}
{"text":"Meet you is located at the old High tea location and the decor hasn't changed much.  It is a weird mix to this place with high tea decor and Chinese food. Not a big fan of it at all.  The food here is more expensive for what you get in average Chinese Restaurant.  The MaPo tofu with rice was okay and the baked cream shrimp & cheese on rice was okay but definitely not worth the price $13 as there was only 5 shrimps.  I did like the staff as they were friendly and attentive.  With so many choices in the area I am not sure I will be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"This venue used to be a high tea place called Annvita English Tearoom, so the decor is exactly the same but now serving Chinese food.

The spice they used for the shrimp skewers were really good. The shrimp tasted fresh even after fried. Moving on to the clams, the signature sauce was nice, but there were way too many small bits of broken shells in there which interrupts the flavour. For an extra $1.50, you can add vermicelli as the base. 

The black truffle chicken rice tasted dry and not enough truffles, I can't really taste the dry fresh truffles. For the price point, I think more truffles or even truffle oil can be added as I can't even smell the scent. 

In terms of service, the waiter was very hard working with a good attitude, he changed our plates and dishes after we finished our clams. All the tables were full, and only 1-2 waiters serving, but still pretty efficient.

The house special chicken wings were pretty good. I will probably come back to try other dishes."}
{"text":"Bingsoo and other desserts are good but hot food not so much. Portions of the hot food are super small and the taste are weird. But staff and environment is really nice. Totally recommend this if youre going for desserts and drinks."}
{"text":"This Chinese restaurant has replaced the previous high tea joint. They have basically kept the decor as is, and just changed the name at the front. 

we had ordered 3 different things on the menu here, which was the tomato sauce baked rice, the beef noodle , and the mango rice ball desert. 

The service here was decent, as is the servers generally seemed to care about what they did. The baked rice the first thing was i find ridiculous was when i asked for more sauce because i specifically saw a previous review how dry it looked. i figured that more sauce might save it. the reply they gave me was their \"chef\" has proportioned everything and is unwilling to add more sauce, now this is a double edge sword, either you have a chef who is so good at what he/she does that they know how to make a perfect portion of everything which is why you don't change the portions. or that this food is actually some form of frozen food pre-made that they just need to heat up in the oven therefore they literally can't add more sauce because its prepacked food. After tasting the baked rice, i have to say it is probably pre-made food. it is not very good, the rice was dry, the sauce was almost non existent, for a dish that depends on a good sauce, and the rice is for some odd reason a flavored rice and not fried rice which is the tradition for a dish like this. Also the portion they gave us with the price is completely unreasonable. with the amount they charge it definitely shouldn't be tv dinner size. to be honest at this point i really wanted to just 2 star them and be done with it. 

my wife however enjoyed their beef noodle and said the beef was pretty good, and also enjoyed the desert, which is why it is back up to 3 star. 

personally. i'm not impressed by either the portion, quality or pricing. the service was decent, and the decor was nice, although that was because the previous tenant did all the decor. personally i would not recommend this place in particular unless you  are desperate for food and its the only place open without a wait time."}
{"text":"Definitely would come back . The noodles are not bad but the crepe and drinks were so good. Didn't expect much from the food cuz it's a dessert/snack place but it was surprisingly delicious unlike the food at surgar Marmalade. Their red bean smoothie was just the perfect sweetness for my taste!"}
{"text":"Beef rib rice was decent as there were generous amount of beef, tasty, just a little too much sauce.  The Korean shaved ice was good. JI CUI GU was tasty, as were the wings. The prices are slightly expensive, beef rib rice on a week day lunch was like $16(incl tax). I guess that's the price of the decor, the interior is very nice as it retained the decor of Ann vita tea room, which was a pricy and photo worthy high tea shop. 
Overall nice environment would go again try something else on the menu."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, but average tasting food thats not really worth its price. Tip: skip the deserts and just get the food. The waiter's pretty cute though."}
{"text":"Came here for dessert after having dinner in the area. I wanted to try the sorbet but unfortunately they didn't have any so I opted for a Taro Smoothie. It was a pretty dec size and tasted good. My fianc√© had the Chilled Mango Pomelo Sago which he said was pretty average. Probably wouldn't return for dessert, but maybe for the food next time!"}
