{"text":"So mediocre. Menu limited. High priced. Don't go unless you want corned beef."}
{"text":"Definitely not the same character as Downtown location, more pub or tavern-esque. Food I felt was comparable, unlike other reviewers. Our server was polite & attentive, the hostess is not. I've been here a handful of times since it opened and she's routinely cold but once you're seated you'll enjoy yourself."}
{"text":"This isn't your average review, but rather more of a comparison.  Almost everyone writing these reviews are comparing their experience to the original Slyman's downtown.  I just got done eating my sandwich.  I arrived at the tavern about 10 minutes before opening and there were already about 25 people in line.  It just opened a few days ago, so I was expecting this.  The employees were organized and were able to accommodate the immediate rush of patrons quickly.

It took about 15 minutes for me to get my food and I took it back to work (right around the corner).  The sandwiches are slightly smaller than the downtown location. Prices are the same (about $15 for corned beef reuben). 

The flavor was good, but not as good as downtown.  This might be caused from the new equipment being used in the kitchen.  I think people who are giving bad reviews are being rather critical.  The food is great and they have a huge selection of BEER, which is always a winner in my book. Welcome to Independence Slyman's Tavern !!"}
{"text":"Slyman's is nothing short of delicious! Incredible portions, friendly service and delicious food. What more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"Pretty disappointed by this Slymans. I've heard the original location down town is wonderful, but this one was closer so we thought we'd check it out. 

Service was okay, bartender was super nice but the service was kind of slow. We sat at the bar which is exposed to the outside. Where we sat a large shade umbrella fell down behind us, I let the first person I saw know, and he just walked up to it, and then walked around it, not doing anything with it. Maybe 20 minutes later an older guy tripped over it and he then told another person, she also did nothing and the man ended up moving it himself with another staff member who saw him holding it. When our ruben came out, it tasted fine, nothing special but pretty good, until I found a black hair in my sandwich. I politely set it to the side and finished the rest of the half of my sandwich, no need to make a scene. When the bar tender asked to take my plate I showed  her the hair and she acted shocked and said she'd tell the manger, who I could see a foot away from me. He never came over or apologized, and eventually she came back and said, \"We took half off the check!\" 

If you're going to serve food with a hair in it, it's pretty tacky to not comp the entire sandwich. I'm happy to pay for my iced tea and soup, but I thought the half off thing was pretty absurd. Of course I could have complained and demanded my sandwich to be comped, who know if there were more hairs in it??  But I really didn't expect for it to be an issue. 

I paid, tipped and left. But will definitely not be back."}
{"text":"Been here twice. first experience was a corned beef dinner, and let me say they certainly didn't skimp on the meat. Thinly sliced, moist and tender. Everything corned beef should be. I was slightly disappointed in the amount of cabbage served with it (cabbage is what. 15 cents a pound?) but I really have no reason to complain.

My second visit I tried the fish and chips. I was very skeptical going into an obviously very accomplished corned beef place and having fish, but the menu stated it was a \"favorite\", so I bit. Let me tell you, I was not disappointed in any way. Thick, tender pieces of cod, perfectly battered and above average fries. If you have read any of my other reviews, you know fish and chips is my standard candle for pub / bar food, and Slyman;s delivers. I would not hesitate to order anything here, no matter how counter intuitive it might seem.

Beer selection could be a bit more varied (too heavy towards IPA's for my taste), but I would never turn down a friend who wanted to meet here."}
{"text":"Picked up 2 corned beef sandwiches to take home for dinner. Delicious! Will definitely go again next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"This was excellent food with excellent service.  The portions were large but sandwiches do not come with fries, so don't forget to order those also."}
{"text":"Wonderful food!! Ordered a BLT and a side of fries and came back the following week and had it again. The fries are amazing. The bacon was yummy and the sandwich was nicely made with plenty of bacon. We got the food carryout for lunch at the office and it was still nice and hot when we got back. Everything was packed so nicely with extra napkins and condiments.  Very pleased and will be back for more!"}
{"text":"Slyman's Tavern is a great place to watch a sporting event because they have so many TVs. The service is good. They have a decent beer selection. However, for the quality and quantity of food that you receive, the prices are too high. The original Slyman's in downtown Cleveland is better, but this Rockside Road location is a decent, but far from perfect, substitute."}
{"text":"Stopped in Friday night with my wife 

We were greeted right away by the hostess. We decide to sit at the bar because of all the TV's.  

Barmaid came right over for our drinks.  Explained happy hour specials because they only had 15 minutes left.  Great customer service!! 

Order a pretzel that was perfect.  Onion rings came with a great dipping sauce. 

We decided to split a corn beef sandwich with Swiss.  I have been to the Saint Clair location many times so the bar was very high for this sandwich.   It delivered, I loved half of the sandwich.  I ever eat some of my wife's.  It was exactly like Saint Clair. I was concerned it would be different.   

Decor is really simple and clean.  Lots of TV's."}
{"text":"Good food, and very busy for dinner on a Saturday evening, although we only had to wait about 10 mins. to be seated. There was really nowhere to stand and wait, except outside with smokers. There are some individual tables, but there are also some large high tops that seat about 10 people, and they seat multiple smaller parties all together there. My party of two was one of them, and we felt like we were awkwardly forced into everyone's conversations. The tables were also so close together that the person behind me kept hitting my chair when getting up to leave. It was very loud to the point I my friend and I could not hear each other when trying to converse. On the plus side, the decor was really cool, there were plenty of television monitors to watch any game that happens to be on, and the staff was extremely nice. I also appreciated our server's honest recommendation when I had trouble deciding what to order. I will return but will probably order carry out."}
{"text":"Will continue to go to downtown slymans as the taste was there much smaller sandwich and cost more wont come back first time I ever finished a slymans corn beef did service was ok but wanted another drink waiter did not come back to offer not real happy"}
{"text":"Wouldn't recommend going here. Food is mediocre at best, don't order the homemade potato salad as a side - zero flavor. 

I ordered a burger, my husband ordered the corn beef sandwich, not impressed with either. 

Service was terrible, our appetizer came out cold.  All in all a bad experience, if we wouldn't of had a gift card, we would have gone across the street to Melt."}
{"text":"I love this place!

It can be packed but staff remains so friendly.

Of course great corned beef sandwiches but the egg salad great for lunch.

Inviting bar area with super nice bartenders who are patient and helpful. 

Ask for Denise at the bar... she knows her drinks and smiles her way into the experience.

Cozy yet busy atmosphere!!

5 stars!!! A must for lunch.  A sure bet for dinner!"}
{"text":"The corned beef is just like at the original Slymans. Nice  atmosphere, and agreat staff."}
{"text":"This is a good place and a lot of food. Most likely taking food home even with a small plate.  Love that they have this place out here in Independence road."}
{"text":"Nice environment and a decent happy hour, however, the salad was mediocre.   The dressing is right out of a bottle.  Also, an extra 50 cent charge to sub in swiss cheese on an already $14 corned beef sandwhich."}
{"text":"Stopped by Slyman's last week to sit at bar and enjoy a sandwich, drink and Cavs game. Great atmosphere to achieve that objective. Ordered the BLT and fries. The sandwich was fantastic, replete with a half-pound of quality bacon. I devoured the sandwich with ease. My bartender Amy made me an excellent Manhattan. The drink was fantastic but her personality was even better. She made my visit memorable. She was personable and on the spot from a service standpoint. My only critique would be the fries. They are standard frozen, crinkled fries. I generally prefer fresh-cut style. I would definitely recommend Slyman's. Quality food, excellent service and perfect location."}
{"text":"Great food! Corned beef was as good as downtown original and great menu overall. Loved the pretzel app."}
{"text":"The place looks great inside. Our waitress seemed a little weird like she had been drinking or something.  She would be gone for extended periods of time and it wasn't even busy. Shared a corned beef sandwich with my wife, the one that has the toasted bread. Sadly the corned beef wasn't as tender as im used to getting around Cleveland.  But the Slyman Fries are crazy good. They would be even better if they didn't use krinkle fries. Im going to come back just for those though. Maybe get them to go to avoid the service."}
{"text":"We've been anxiously awaiting the Slyman's Tavern to open!  We went on opening day for dinner and were certainly not disappointed.  What a treat!  My husband, I and our three daughters all tried different things (and then shared!).  We got one corned beef sandwich, several bowls of noodle soup, a grilled corned beef reuben and the pastrami sandwich.  Truly - counting the days until we can return!  By far the BEST pastrami any of us has ever had.  The corned beef was also out of this world - same quality and size as downtown Slyman's but so much better because we could wash it down with a cold craft beer!  We loved the awesome beer selection and bar.  The Moscow Mule was delicious too!  Great atmosphere, cool artwork on the walls and it will be a great place to watch sporting events with all the TV's.  Looking forward to a return trip soon."}
{"text":"I just returned home from Slyman's Tavern. I had high hopes. I knew going in that this wasn't the Slyman's downtown after I read an article that said Slyman's sold their name for franchise purposes. We ordered corned beef and roast beef brisket sandwiches and traded halves to taste. Both were dry beyond belief. I could not swallow the corned beef, and the roast beef couldn't be dryer or had any less flavor. Very disappointed. And just because I'm a masochist, we ordered a slice of cheesecake, because come on, every deli has good cheesecake. Nope. This was as dry as the sandwiches were despite having a flavorless raspberry topping. No kidding--it had no taste whatsoever. It wasn't even sweet. Anyway, received our check only to find a promotion card to get on the email list for the Tilted Kilt. Had I known there was any affiliation, I never would have stopped at Slyman's. So did the Tilted Kilt buy the Slyman's franchise so they could open a place in the 'burbs? That's my guess. We paid too much for so little. Not going back--no reason to."}
{"text":"I recently visited here during happy hour. Was able to park and be seated immediately. We were able to order few appetizers which arrived quickly. We got the smaller portion of corned beef and even that was still stacked high. What was amazing though even with all that meat it wasn't dry and quite good. I personally think it's more like a pastrami and pickles and mustard were a must have.

Can't wait to go back and try breakfast."}
{"text":"I highly recommend the Ruben. The service was good. Friendly people working. They have the best corned beef. The only area that needs improvement is the French fries. Frozen crinkle fries are okay but definitely don't stand out. They need to come up with something new."}
{"text":"My husband and I had lunch here over the weekend and it was okay. We both had \"melts\", that's a reuben minus the sauerkraut and I wasn't impress at all.  Of course when you first see the sandwich you say WOW it's so big, however, after looking at it, you notice that they give you wonderful slices of corn beef on the top and bottom and fill the middle with shavings. I don't mind paying for a good sandwich but was very disappointed that I paid 15.50 for a sandwich full of shavings.  The downtown location does the same with filling the middle with shavings and only a little of sliced corn beef  on the top and bottom. If I wanted shavings I could have just purchased a pound for 8.00 bucks."}
{"text":"The food at Slyman's is INCREDIBLE. I've come before for the excellent corned beef--which has yet to disappoint--but this time I treated myself to the \"Sly\" Dog - a hot dog bathed with crumbled corned beef and a delicious cheese sauce. OH MY GOODNESS IT WAS GOOD. I don't ordinarily take food porn pictures, but here you go. 

The service, as usual, was impeccable, and very friendly. Our waitress brought out a small sample of the pasta salad for my seat-mate to try, never let a glass get empty, and was as pleasant as could possibly be. 

It does not get much better htan this."}
{"text":"Great corned beef! Large sandwich easy enough to split between two people.  Glad I came when I was in town.  We were in and out of there within 30 minutes.  I will come back next time in Big Cle! 

Atmosphere is nice so you can hang around but we were in a hurry so next time we can be prepared to spend more time eating and chatting it up ."}
{"text":"Killer sandwich, went twice while in town, good service with a full bar. Clean restrooms always good to see."}
{"text":"The place is nice. The staff is friendly. The kitchen was a tad slow and has to work out some kinks. I loved the selection of craft beer.

The food was tasty but not the size or flavor of the Slyman's downtown. I got an original size Reuben and a side of coleslaw. The sandwich was $15 and the side was extra. My bill was $20 and all I had to drink was water. 

This place is way too pricey for lunch and needs to examine their value. I would recomend going to Melt across Rockside Rd. for a cheaper sandwich."}
{"text":"I want to start this off by saying I have been a a big Slyman's supporter for most of my life and it has always had a special place I my heart for my self and family. Today that all changed. One of the members of our party found a black fingernail in their sand which. This ruined not his meal but everyone's else's as well. I understand mistakes are made but this shows that they are not using gloves while making sandwiches. We did not get an apology or any discount except for the one sandwich. I am very disappointed and will not be back to Slyman's. It ruined our day and quite possibly Christmas weekend."}
{"text":"Awesome food & excellent staff
Can't wait until next opening and food truck"}
{"text":"I went there for a famous corned beef to go.  The barmaid/waitress was down right ride, she ignored me and my son. She kept wiping the bar like we were not there. I was trying to get her attention when two guys say at the bar she said what can I get you.  I then said we were here and she continued to ignore us.  So I caught another worker who took our order.  We order two big corned beef she placed the order. Then I told my son let's bounce.  We left and I'll never go back"}
{"text":"The food at Slyman's Tavern is really good, and the menu is much larger than the menu of the original Slyman's. The appetizer selections are very good on this menu as well. I ordered a corned beef sandwich, which was every bit as good as the ones at the original Slyman's, despite the fact that it was noticably smaller (I ordered the full-sized sandwich, so I was suprised). I also ordered a side of potato pancakes, which were very good as well. The interior of the restaurant/bar is very nice, and it is clearly a well thought out design. The mural on the wall is super cool, and the retractable roof over the rear of the bar is very cool as well. Overall, it is definatly a great restaurant and bar, and if they alter the size of the sandwiches and make them as big as the ones at the original location, then it will be totally epic."}
{"text":"Did carry out. Girl taking the order kept telling us they did not have what we were ordering and had to give her instructions as to where on menu it was located. My Tavern Chef salad was extremely small and barely any lettuce. Will never order from here again. Extremely disappointed as I was excited to try a new restaurant ever since they moved in."}
{"text":"Everything was amazing! Our waitress was also very nice and checked on us often. The bill could get a little steep, but since the portions that we saw coming out were so large we got 1 main dish and an appetizer to share which was more than enough food! The only down side is that we felt a little crammed in! I would definitely recommend this place!!! Enjoy : )"}
{"text":"So glad my husband and I decided to give this Slyman's a try. We love the original in Cleveland so we were a little skeptical but we were not disappointed. The place looks great and the patio is awesome! We had excellent service and felt like we were at the original with the same yummy corned beef sandwich. Also loved that we could enjoy a beer and come for dinner versus having to go at lunch. We will definitely be back!  Thank you Syman's for expanding and opening this location!"}
{"text":"I ordered the Roast Beef sandwich - even with horseradish and mayo, the roast beef was very dry."}
{"text":"Went for the classic..corned beef.  Loved the option of a smaller version of the original.  Also had the potato latkes with corned beef and swiss as an appetizer.  It was fantastic.  Another dinner ordered French fries and disappointed that they weren't fresh cut.  Might be a nice upgrade for Slyman's to consider. The food was good but the service was slow.  Still rated it high because it was worth waiting for!"}
{"text":"Great place for deli sandwiches that are huge! It's pricey-$11 for the sandwich only however it was so huge that I really couldn't eat it and would have been fine splitting it with my daughter. We had the traditional corned beef sandwiches, I slather it with horseradish because I love it! Also had an order of sauerkraut balls and potato salad. Everything was really good and our server was super friendly to the kids and attentive. We will be back but between 2 kids and 2 adults- a $50 lunch just isn't reasonable."}
{"text":"Terrible. Never got in the door. We called 5 minutes before and they said they had room for 9. We get there and they say there is no way they could do it. Not even nice about it. Don't know how the food is but the attitude sucks.  I would give zero stars if I could

We were told you could not accommodate us and we were never told to wait 15 minutes. When we spoke to Kelly before we arrived we were under the impression it would not be a problem. We are at a different restaurant now."}
{"text":"This place is amazing, best corned beef around. The staff and wait times have always been great even when the place is packed."}
{"text":"I have been to both locations Rockside and Harvard and both the food and service are terrible, A friend of mine took me to the original downtown and the food was AMAZING nothing at all like the TAVERN. The sandwiches are dryer and smaller at the Taverns.  I also found out that the one on Rockside and the one on Harvard along with a food truck??? are franchises and they're not family owned and operated like the downtown store. Do yourself a favor and avoid this Slyman's Tavern  and the one on Rockside both of them are the worst.  Do yourself a favor and stick with the original SLYMANS DELI downtown on St Clair and see the real reason the Slyman name is famous avoid the impostors that are just living off the name."}

{"text":"Good food, great service! Reuben's stacked high but hardly any sauerkraut and ours came out pretty chilly.  We were excited to try the free Slymans fries that you get for checking in, but they were just ok.  Crinkle cut fries with cheese sauce that made them soggy before we dished them out and didn't have too much taste overall.  Again, service was great and quick but the for the price the food wasn't really up to expectations."}
{"text":"Great spot for a breakfast meeting. Food Is reasonably priced and tasty. Menu offers a wide variety of breakfast options. The service was excellent. Our waitress repeatedly filled our coffee mugs and water glasses. We did not have to wait long for our food."}
{"text":"Since this place opened we have been regular diners for dinner but on this Sunday we decided to stop in at noon. When we arrived the place was packed but got seated right away.  Walking to our seats we saw there was a buffet so we both decided to order it. Much to our surprise most of the food bins at the buffet were empty so we waited and waited and waited...
After getting pretty disgusted I decided to change my order to a sandwich!  I guess maybe they were just too busy to keep up?  Not really my problem though, if they can't keep up with the demand then don't offer a buffet as it could possibly ruin in for future visitors.  
I don't believe that I will ever be back for breakfast! Dinner maybe."}
{"text":"As advertised!! A lot more dressed up but same overall quality in food, prep, service and a real step up in menu.  I just still wish they used larger slices of rye bread.  The Rubens and even the plain cb sandwiches are off-kilter in bite by bite taste because of such an easy fix. They REALLY, REALLY ARE!  And c'mon guys, do you really have to still impress with portion size?"}
{"text":"Stopped in to buy their famous original corn beef sandwich. Take-out menu said $13.99, restaurant menu said $14.49, I was charged $15.49!?!?! The sandwich itself was good, just a ton of corn beef on a tiny piece of rye and swiss - definitely not worth $15.59"}
{"text":"Went for the Sunday brunch, but what we got was a messy table of over cooked food and tea instead of coffee (we ordered coffee).  The brunch is really terrible and should be avoided.  The table where the food is displayed was scattered with food remnants.  Some bins were nearly empty and others like the potatoes bin were over cooked and mushy (not browned).  They will make an omelet for you but won't get it right.  We had 6 people at our table and every order came back wrong.  The fruit salad had grapes that we so sour it made our mouths dry.  Although they looked good, the chef obviously doesn't try his own food.  What's up with this place?"}
{"text":"Was working in the area and have allways heard great things about this place..it was awesome"}
{"text":"Slymans Tavern has great corned beef, the roast beef dinner has always come out luke warm. Mashed potatoes are instant, for $17.49, I would expect a hot, real mashed dinner. The potato pierogies are very good, if you don' t mind them being deep fried. I have yet to try the turkey, but here it is good. I don't mind waiting for my food as long as it comes out hot. Service is slow. On  cleanliness, I watched the hostess wipe half of the table and take the same towel to the chairs and then back up to the table, missing an entire spot where something was spilled. I will give it another chance still, they just need some work."}
{"text":"Best corned beef in Cleveland. Not cheap, but the portions are enough for two meals. The staff is always friendly. Glad they brought it out to the suburbs. I had been going to the St. Clair location for years"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying the food was very good.  Had the corned beef and some sauerkraut balls.  Can't go wrong.

As for the service, it was lacking at best.  Had a small group and they couldn't seem to get it together.  Waiter took two drink orders and left the rest of us.  Then didn't come back.  Seats were available behind us so the rest of our group showed up and we tried to coordinate since nobody else would.  We took two chairs from our crowded table and put them at our other table to spread us out.  Same number of people were going to be at both of our tables.  Holy cow!  The manager gave one of the women in our party an earful about moving a chair.  Not just an irritating comment, but downright nasty.  My friend asked for her bill, grabbed her family and went to Panera in the same mall area.  The manager came over later and said she was sorry, ...... but people can't be moving chairs around!  I told her that was one issue.  The other was that we sat there for 55 minutes and our order wasn't taken.  She let me know that large groups are tough to accommodate.  Ahhh, everyone got one drink, no refills and no food order taken.  Large group my foot!  They seated us in two different sections so it was just two regular tables to them.  Love the food, but not on my list to go back to any time soon.

Oh yeah, it was the night of an Ohio State football game.  And they weren't prepared for a crowd?"}
{"text":"My first and last trip. Service was slow, food was room temp from the Buffett but the overall selection was good. What really turned me off was the douchebag attitude of the \"manager\" John. The flyer, which I will also post indicates that the breakfast buffet is $10.99. It rings up $12.99. He argues me that's it is not for their location, which the flyer does not indicate and flat out refused to charge the the price on the very flyer that sent me there. It's cool, the $4 was not going to break my pockets. The refusal to charge what THEIR FLYER said the price was, shaped my opinion of this place and for whatever it's worth, I won't patronize again. Ever!"}
{"text":"BUYER BEWARE! Slyman's Tavern has implemented a new policy of confiscating your driver's license in exchange for drinking a moscow mule... to be returned to you if you don't walk off with the copper mug. Unfortunately, they have yet to put protocol in place to ensure the staff take responsibility for returning said driver's license. Tavern ownership held the customer accountable, refusing to even speak with the customer about it directly.

The very mediocre service and the additional 45 minute drive back there and home left a sour taste, despite the good food."}
{"text":"Not worth your time unless you want bad service and average food. Reuben doesn't hold a candle to the original and they don't care about correcting mistakes. Too many other good options out there."}
{"text":"Amazing corn beef. Enough said. I also like the craft beer selection. The sandwiches are definitely a large portion so you can say you're getting what you paid for. If you go during lunch hours expect at least a 15 min wait it gets pretty crowded. This place has a nice bar and an outside patio"}
{"text":"WOW

I was visiting Cleveland doing some work and staying at a nearby hotel. Went here for a bite to eat with my cousin who lives nearby. She had heard about this place yet never tried it. I checked Yelp and of course there were great reviews. So I twisted her arm. Not really and we decided to give it a try. When I return to the Cleveland area, this will be defiantly be a return to place. I strongly recommend giving it a try. It also allows you to have a nice lunch/ meal for another day. 

They also have an AWSOME selection of beers on tap! Along with a big selection of bottles to pick from. This is basically a sandwich  place. But OH MY GOODNESS, what a selection. I had the corn beef grilled. I figured for 13.99 ok a little pricey but what a beer selection, they had a really good milk stout. And it was served at correct temperature.  The sandwich arrived and WOW, AWSOME & HOLY COW are just the first descriptive words That immediately came to mind.  I could only eat 1/2 the sandwich. For 13.99 it is Defiantly worth the price. 

The staff was AWSOME. Our server accidentally ordered a full sandwich for my cousin, he put in the difference of $4.00 now that is AWSOME. I have never experience anything like that before. I didn't even have to question him about it. 

It was amazing when as the evening went on and obviously it was cool enough out side, they rolled back the ceiling exposing the night sky. Truly amazing."}
{"text":"Very nice sports bar atmosphere. Lots of tv's. Portions are huge. My husband got the corned beef sandwich which was great and I got the pierogis. They were deep fried and no onions were served with it! Real pierogis are not deep fried and are loaded with grilled onions! Disappointing!"}
{"text":"We ordered take out and my husband got the Famous Corn Beef and had no complaints. I just got a Burger, because I was sharing with my daughter and you know what picky eaters kids are lol and it was pretty good, but the fries need some help. They aren't anything special and are lacking on the salt."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is great and the staff is very friendly.  Ordered the large Reuben   and it was good but not the same size or flavor as downtown and for almost $16 and no sides really not as enjoyable.  The were out of wings and the burger was probably the worst I have ever seen.  Told the waitress and she said they have to cook well done.  First that means the meat is questionable but well done does not mean charred to powder.  Might go back for a beer but will drive downtown if we crave corned beef"}
{"text":"I've been back for happy hour (the Slyman's fries are a great value!) and the Sunday brunch with the kids, and was very pleased with both experiences.  They do a stellar job decorating for holidays, too."}
{"text":"Long time fan of the Slyman's product.  I was tickled a location was moving closer for me.  I was left unimpressed - I HATED everything about my visit.  1)The handicapped parking is FAR from the entrance - It's around the back/side.  One \"can\" go in through the take out but, then they have to truck across the entire dinning room to get to hostess.  SHAME on you Slyman's for intentionally making it hard on your handicapped diners.  2) The counter high tables and stools are unrealistically tall.  Anyone less than 6 ft tall has to sit with their feet tangling...like a kid.  That is NOT comfortable.  3)The food - ugg. Our food was like that of a chain restaurant that doesn't know what they are doing - Not an award winning restaurant.  The sandwiches were cold.  the corn beef was dry. The pastrami was burnt and in shreds. The onion rings were average, at best.  I don't mind paying a premium price for a premium product.  The orange location is NOT serving or providing a premium product - I was robbed."}
{"text":"Disappointed. Went for breakfast, not many people there, food was room temp, should be hot. Slow service, toast came late too."}
{"text":"Took the family on a Saturday afternoon. The place was packed and this is a big space. They definitely spent a lot of $ on the interior. Wife and kids had the corned beef...they really liked it.  I am not a fan of corned beef, so I was not willing to try some.  I got the cheeseburger with bacon and it was good, but nothing special and didn't justify the 9.50 price tag.  I have had better at The Rail, Wexner's, and B Spot.  I would not go out of my way to eat there again; solid but unspectacular."}
{"text":"I would probably give this a 3.5 stars but I'll go with 4 since the service and atmosphere were great. I came here for a friends birthday that loves Slyman's corned beef. I'm not a huge fan of corned beef or deli meat but was excited to try it out. We were seated in about 15 mins for a party of 6 and the staff was attentive and nice. I was curious about the veggie burger on the menu so I asked if it was made in house - the waiter stated it was a Morningstar burger which I was actually shocked by. I just don't think any restaurant should be serving a Morningstar burger anyone can buy at Walmart (sorry.) I had the turkey melt which was good but didn't come with any sides which you have to order a la carte. Some did get the corned beef and said it was good but not the same as the Cleveland location. 

I love the atmosphere. They have A LOT of TV's to watch sporting events and retractable full length doors that open up to a patio-ish area with the bar wrapped around. 

If you're looking for a casual cool sports bar to grab some sandwiches in the burbs head there."}
{"text":"This place is much nicer and larger than I was expecting it to be. Our waitress was very friendly and attentive to our table. Shout out to all the yelpers who mentioned the free corned beef fries with Check In on the app- the fries were soooo good! They have a good beer list and two happy hours- one until 4-6pm and the other starts at 9pm. At our table we ordered the turkey sliders, the Rachel Wrap and the classic corned beef sandwich. None of us were disappointed by the food and I was excited to have leftovers for lunch the next day."}
{"text":"Standard deli food like corned beef, pastrami, potato pancakes plus more typical tavern food - but no matzo ball soup. Dozens of beers on draft or in bottles/cans. Reasonably priced ($$).

I had a corned beef sandwich which was delicious. Very large and best split with someone else. Potato pancake side was also very good and included three good sized pancakes.

Friendly service but a long wait for a table on a Monday night and an additional long wait for food preparation. Also, very noisy."}
{"text":"Slymans is famous for its corned beef and this location has the same great food. Service was quick and pleasant. I have been eating at the original location for over 30 years and my only negative for this location is the sandwich is definitely smaller. The original doesn't fit in your mouth and you dribble bits of beef on your plate. This one was smaller and not the same experience."}
{"text":"Longtime fan of Slymans original downtown ..... finally made it to Independence site for much anticipated comparison ....... sad to say -- just not as good . This place is a very typical suburban ''sports-bar'' type joint  not unlike all the others ( Rocknes , Quaker Steak, BW3 ,etc . ) same vibe -- tv's all over .... suburbanite clientele ..... overpriced chow .... thats all predictable and OK provided the corned beef is up to the gold standard downtown . It is not . Very similar ... almost there .... but not . My corned beef was very good compared to most other corned beef sandwiches ... but not as good as the champion gold standard downtown Slyman's. For example the corned beef downtown is sliced finer and thinner than what we got in Independence .... additionally there were a few slices that were really fatty/stringy -- never experienced that at the original Slymans downtown .So - in a nutshell .... is this a perfectly good $ 15 dollar corned beef sandwich ? yes - it is ....... is it as good as the original Slymans downtown  ---- no it is not ."}
{"text":"The corned beef sandwiches here are out of control! And this is coming from a nice Jewish girl from NY. I honestly didn't think much of having a corned beef sandwich while in Cleveland but man was u surprised/ impressed. The sandwich first of all is huge! There's about 6 inches of meet on this damn sandwich. No lie! I'd suggest getting the light since it has less meat. After 9pm they have $5 apps. I had the tavern fries which were amazing and much bigger then I had anticipated. If you go to Cleveland I highly recommend eating here especially if you like corned beef. The original one is in down town the environment is awesome and the people are welcoming."}
{"text":"Every time I visit home (Cleveland) my first stop was Slyman's Tavern.  Was.   Last time was December 23rd as I was driving up for Christmas.  I sat at the bar, my wife and I ordered a couple drinks and a couple sandwiches, and I invited my friend to join us.  Sounds like a great evening, right? 

My friend, who is African-American, and I were talking about the old days when we were roommates when some drunk guy approached us at the bar.  He said something to my friend, then came in between us and said \"You guys trying to party tonight?\".  When we said no, he drunkenly muttered that we were causing trouble and that he was calling the police.  He faked calling the police on his phone, saying things like \"Yeah one of them is black so be careful\".  He got \"off the phone\" and told my friend that the police were on their way and that he should put his hands up because they were going to shoot him.  

That is where the fault of the business comes in.  The guy then wandered off back into the kitchen!  He clearly worked for Slyman's!  I immediately noticed and asked for a manager.  She looked grim faced when she arrived, but not particularly surprised.  She claimed that she was going to fire the guy, but I was pretty skeptical because again, before I even told the story she had a pretty grim and knowing look on her face.   She offered to buy us a round for our trouble. Really?  That's the price of being racially harassed in their establishment?  A beer?  

I will miss the corned beef.  But I won't be back to a place that employs and appears to condone racism."}
{"text":"This is not your father's Slyman's, but it still delivers the classic taste you are looking for, just in a new building with a more well-rounded menu.  If you want your corn beef fix without driving to the St. Clair location, this does the trick, but be warned the service it hit-or-miss.

Food-wise the food is what you come to expect from Slyman's amazing corned beef, large portions, and large prices that are worth it. If you are new to Slyman's order the corned beef sandwhich on Rye, eat half and save the other half for your next meal.  It is that big, I promise.  DO NOT be a sucker and order the fries, they are run of the mill crinkle fries, go for the potato pancakes instead, they are to die for!  This location has a larger menu than the traditional Slyman's on St. Clair, the two big differences are the number of salads offered and the addition of appetizers.  At this modern tavern style Slyman's you can get a handful of salads (even ones with chicken!) and their apps menu really steps it up with fried pickles, onion rings, pierogis, and my personal favorite Loaded Latkes which are their classic potato pancakes topped with corned beef and swiss (add an egg to it and kick it up a notch!).

I have been to this location 3 times for lunch between 11:30 and 1pm and it can be a little overwhelming.  It has been packed every time, and there is a feeling of tension during the rush that exudes from the the staff and patrons.The servers and bartender I had were GREAT.  Attentive, polite, got the details right, but you can just tell they are running around trying not to lose it. One of the three times I ate at the Beachwood location the corned beef was dry, and another time my potato pancakes were soggy, but it might just be due to the lunch rush on the kitchen/staff.  Also, it can get so loud that you almost have to yell, which might not be ideal for a business lunch.

I will probably avoid this location during lunch or just order carryout maybe.  Hopefully the rush dies down a little as the location becomes less novel.  Your belly will not be disappointed in you for trying this place, just be ready to deal with all the rest that comes with it!"}
{"text":"Lean tasty corned beef and service was good.  I sat at the window next to the bar.  My complaint deals with the very loud crashing sounds that happened every time the barmaid threw the dishes into the dirty dish container under the bar.  The happened every time she cleaned up after a customer.

Very, very annoying!

I would expect that at a $2.99 dinner... Not when I am paying $15 for a sandwich?"}
{"text":"BEST.CORNEDBEEF.SANDWICH.EVER.....I'm glad Slymans opened a location to a more bar atmosphere and good hours...Def will be back again soon...and a must try"}
{"text":"Three things to help you out here.

1. They are open for breakfast.  It is pretty good and fairly well priced.
2. They are really focused on the tavern portion.
3. They are not really as good as the original downtown store.  Way over priced for what you get.  Quality is okay.

But, as I mentioned, they focus on the tavern.  And for that, they do great."}
{"text":"This is not a cheap place to grab a sandwich. Our family of five spent about a hundred dollars on fried pickle chips, five sandwiches, 3 soft drinks and two orders of fries. I lead with this because cost is important, but also: it was good. The portions are also enormous, and we brought home fries and two half sandwiches, enough for two lunches. 

If you are familiar with Slyman's in Cleveland, and you've never been to the tavern on Rockside, you'll enjoy the differences - much roomier, full bar, spacious seating area and the same great corned beef in huge portions. Sandwiches come in original size and light size. The original will give you multiple meals. The deli meats were all good, the bread fresh. Superior sandwiches at a premium price, a great place to gather. The pickle chips were really good and the fries were perfect and delivered hot. We go to Slymans a few times a year, always knowing we're going to pay...but it's  always worth it."}
{"text":"Just stopped in having never heard of Slymans. What a great meal and great staff. Highly recommended to anyone in the area looking for a quick bite."}
{"text":"After hearing a lot of hype about Slyman's Tavern, I went out to the Beachwood location for a lunch with two of my buddies. First things first, be prepared for a wait in line if you arrive right at noon on a weekday. With the local businesses, hospitals, and suburban homes nearby, you'll be sure to be putting your name down to wait in line to be seated. My party of 3 waited approximately 30 minutes. 

I took a look around at other tables to get an idea of the sandwich sizes and meat portions, and ultimately I ordered the Reuben Corned beef sandwich from the \"Grilled Favorites\" section of the menu, and for the sake of not overstuffing my stomach, I requested the \"Lighter\" portion of meat. This Reuben sandwich was quite tasty, although also quite salty. Fortunately the sauerkraut and the dressing/sauce on the side helped to neutralize some of the saltiness, but you could say I definitely met my water bottle drinking quota for the rest of the day.

As far as the hype goes, I think this is a good place to get your corned-beef sandwich fix, just as long as you don't mind the wait time, the unwarranted high prices, and a sports-bar-like atmosphere with a matching sports-bar-like service."}
{"text":"It took 45 minutes to be seated in a restaurant half full. We're still waiting to be served a half hour after being seated, stuck in the patio during a rainstorm without being offered a seat inside at one of the MANY empty tables. Out of the requested beverage, I want to scream! They blame the kitchen being behind, can you imagine if they ever had a full house. I won't come back for a long time, which is a shame as we live close and enjoyed the other locations. Maybe somday they'll get it together.. but as for now, THE MANAGEMENT SUCKS. Food just arrived, corned beef is dry and cold... go To Jack's Deli... this is just plain horrible, they should be ashamed"}
{"text":"We came here at 5:30 on a Friday night, no wait, not crowded at all. We got sat and then we waited a longgggg time for a server to come over. My Dad went up and asked someone. She came over, was not overly friendly, did not introduce herself and did not apologize for the unnecessary wait. We ordered, got and ate our appetizers before our drinks from the bar ever arrived. The waitress got one of the beers wrong and so she took the one away to get the correct, and this took FOREVER. We should have just got it for free at that point. Then our checks were wrong, and that took forever for the waitress to fix as well. No apologies for the wrong beer, or the wait on the corrected checks. The food was fine but nothing special. Our table had the pub pretzel, onion rings, greek salad with tuna, club sandwich, patty melt and corn beef sandwich. The corn beef was dry. We won't be back. Very unlike the Independence location that I've been to a few times."}
{"text":"Just okay.  Service was pleasant, though a bit disorganized.  Food is unremarkable.  $14.95 for a sandwich of corned beef between 2 slices of soggy rye bread and nothing else is a bit steep.  Not nearly the size of sandwich photos shown for the original location.  Side of crinkle fries was clearly reheated from bagged frozen fries and just as tasteless, plus lukewarm.  I'd go back if friends wanted to, but won't hurry back on my own.  I've been told the St. Clair restaurant is better so I'll try there next time."}
{"text":"I am a Cleveland transplant living in Columbus and look forward to my trips to Cleveland for family and food.  Was staying in Independence for a family reunion and was surprised to see a Slymans and to top it off was open early and late.  Enjoyed the Sunday brunch and grabbed a corned beef for the road. This capped off a great weekend.  Hoping next location will be 135 miles south on I71."}
{"text":"Stopped in today and got an original corned beef and a side of potato salad to go.  There were a couple of people in front of me placing take out orders.  Very few customers at tables.  After placing my order it took 22 minutes to get my food.  And that may have been the best part of the visit.

Pieces of the corned beef were thickly sliced and were inedible.  Most of the rest of the sandwich seemed to be small shaved pieces.  The meat was dry.  It certainly isn't anywhere near what they serve downtown.  Truly disappointing.

The potato salad was relatively bland.  There were quite a few big chunks of potato and they didn't appear to be cooked thoroughly.  Not very good.  

Overall, very disappointing.  Don't think I would go there again."}
{"text":"If you like the food at Slyman's downtown, you will like it here too.  On a warm evening, with the patio open, you catch a nice breeze even if sitting inside.  The front windows open too, creating a great open air feel. The staff was very friendly and efficient.  The beer list is long.   If you're looking for a fancy restaurant, go somewhere else.  If you want a good meal at a reasonable price, check it out!"}
{"text":"We were so surprised that a Cleveland institution had finally opened a location outside of downtown!  This spacious and nicely decorated building features retractable exterior walls and what ends up being an outdoor patio when the weather is nice!  It has a huge, beautiful bar, lovely murals, interesting decor, and FRIENDLY staff!

  The menu is huge and they even feature a brunch bar on Sundays with a Bloody Mary bar!  How awesome is that!  I've tried their club sandwich for something different and the standard reuben and nothing disappoints.   Be prepared for a crowd at lunchtime and bring a big appetite!  I also love their fries!"}
{"text":"Wow, what a disappointment,and I don't usually crucify people on yelp. First it's super noisy, disorganized.  Where do you sign in at.  Very limited menu, all meat items.  Hello vegans, no salad.  Just drink your supper!   And by the way meat lovers there is like 5 dishes on the menu.  Clearly for the under 30 crowd who can hear over deafening noise.  You'd think with only 5 dishes that you could bring the food faster.  And what was wrong with our waitress.  We asked for ketchup and 15 minutes later we borrowed the table's next to us.  My meat eating hubby said worst corn beef sandwich EVER.  Don't worry about building it up around Slyman's, this is no draw for me."}
{"text":"A refreshing change of pace from the original Slyman's downtown.  The downtown location is too much of a push and shove match for me and the attitude of the servers, well, sucks.  Plus it is more of a grab n go deli that is very cramped and old.  Or to be politically correct you can call it an institution!  This location is brand new and is more like a sports bar and is very nicely appointed.  Lots of TVs.  Pretty extensive beer and wine list.  Big food menu with smaller versions of their ridiculously overstuffed sandwiches so thank God for that.  Our server was very good.  This is a pretty good addition to the Rockside restaurant scene."}
{"text":"We heard a lot about the sandwiches from the downtown location so we went to the independence location because it was closer. In a nutshell the service was horrible. Took us 5 min for the waitress to come by and take our drink order and then 10 minutes to actually bring the drink out. The place wasn't even that busy. We ordered the tavern fries as an app and the fries seemed like they were of the frozen type, but the sauce on them were good. We ordered your standard Reuben sandwich and that was actually pretty good. I can't knock the sandwich too much. Our bill was like 90 dollars though for 2 sandwiches, fries appetizer and 4 beers. I wouldn't go back again. The sandwiches aren't that good enough to put up with bad service."}
{"text":"pretty good place to eat. 
i was worried at first because the service started slow. i ordered some soup (corned beef and cabbage) and a pastrami rueben. Danielle had a turkey rueben. we both liked our meals, though my soup could have used a little something else. my sandwich was very tasty and they brought out horseradish to pile onto the sandwich. that helped clear my sinuses. 
i'd like to try it again sometime for sure."}
{"text":"Service is not so great here, the workers and people who hangs around this place are not the friendliest. We walked in once and everyone seemed so busy doing nothing"}
{"text":"We arrived at 5:40 PM and should have known that something was wrong when the place was about 90% empty at dinner time.  We waited over 15 minutes at our table and no one ever came over to take our order. Manager just stood at bar looking at us.  There were two waitress who moved so slow I thought I was at the post office.  They walked by us and never looked at us.  They only served 2 tables and brought things out 1 at time.  We heard a comment from the couple at the next table that they would never come back here again.  We finally got up and left. Can't comment on the food because we never were served anything, not even water.  Menu also looked over priced for the food that I saw go by us. This place just opened recently, and it is unlikely that it will be open in 1 year.  It looks like a money grab from owners downtown who clearly are not providing oversight to this restaurant and have no interest in providing quality service.  They will reap what they sow.  Would give 0 stars if possible. Went over to Winking Lizard and had a good meal at what would have been half the price.  Avoid Slyman's at all cost. Won't even go to downtown restaurant  any more either."}
{"text":"We have eaten here twice.  Service was ok the first time.  Less awesome the second.

First time:  They told my wife they had something and then didn't. She was upset because she has a very limited diet and was hungry.  I asked if I could try/buy a sample of the brisket and was told no.  If you live in CLE you know brisket runs the gamut from super fatty to lean so it was a pass for me.  Food was ok but I was surprised when giant (pastrami maybe?) sandwiches were coming out but the turkey sandwiches we ordered were sparse.  

Second time:  Waitress got my son's order wrong (turkey sandwich, no tomato) and forgot his salad.  When she finally came back to our table (runner brought the food) she said \"oh yeah. I forget it. Oh well.\"  

Overall food is meh.  The deli meats aren't great and on the turkey sandwiches we've ordered they've been stingy.  They only have two choices of cheese (Swiss and American) which is ridiculous.

There are better sandwich shops with more selection, more generous portions, and better prices around the corner.  I don't see Slyman's lasting.  Especially when they put more restaurants in that shopping center.  I'd pass."}
{"text":"Everything was really great here! I had a corned beef sandwich (which was MASSIVE by the way) along with the slyman fries. I'll definitely be returning her with my family and friends"}
{"text":"I thought the price was a little steep until the sandwich arrived. I barely finished half of the sandwich and I had leftovers for the next day. I had the Rueben and it was one of the best that I've had. The meat was very tender, flavorful and fresh. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Simply put, best Reuben in Cleveland. I would travel downtown for slymans in the past and am thrilled they opened in the independence area. 

Great bar, great and fast service, awesome corned beef."}
{"text":"Eaten here 2x. Had a good meal both times. Open late. Like it. Great decoration and atmosphere. Staff very nice. Had a small turkey sandwich first time w gravy fries. Enjoyed. Had chicken soup and egg salad sandwich 2nd time. Enjoyed that too. Will continue to try different things. Love that I don't have to go dt for Slymans. Their hours don't meet my schedule since I don't live or work dt. This is next best thing."}
{"text":"This was a nice sandwich shop I visited with a friend yesterday.  We walked in and we were greeted promptly and seated quickly.  Service was good, but food was slightly slow coming out. I got the turkey sandwich with fries.  I was disappointed that the place only had two cheese options, but overall it was ok.  I was pleased that the restroom was clean as well."}
{"text":"Top notch Lady Bar Tender - Great lighting and very well done DJ Tunes throughout!
      Clean and well organized - Did not eat.
  Beer Cold !"}
{"text":"I think we can all agree that the original Slyman's is quite possibly the best thing to ever happen to Cleveland. I'd give this location 3.5 stars if I could. 

Went for breakfast on a Sunday morning and it was just okay. I had corned beef hash and it came out cold. The eggs weren't great but, Slyman's corned beef to the rescue. It was fantastic as always. There were four breakfast dishes to choose from as well as a breakfast buffet (which didn't include any corned beef). I would have just ordered a regular sandwich had I known. Service was good, we didn't have to wait at all and the atmosphere of the restaurant was pretty cool. 

I have had breakfast at the original location and I remember it being out of this world good. I'll definitely give this location another shot, it just wasn't what I expected."}
{"text":"I went to slymans and received amazing service. The food was great. Thanks guys for making it an overall good night out."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the happy hour prices and the appetizers. Waiter was attentive and knew the menu without referring back to it. 
Good experience and will visit Syman's Tavern often."}
{"text":"Was crazy over priced. But good corn beef hash.(fresh!)
And try! try! your sandwich  toasted  ( $2 extra, STUPID!) with egg ($1more). Was the best. Don't skip the horseradish."}
{"text":"Wow, just wow!  I got sliders from the appetizer Menu and it's a meal in itself.  My husbands got fish & chips - AMAZING!!!  Petrified were fresh made a s also yummy.  The manager was very accommodating to change the channel for the TV a the bar and the bartender was generous with samples . Definitely a repeat - we are new to Ohio so looking for the best places to hang out come winter."}
{"text":"tasty and quick but very pricey for size, sandwich comes with pickly only, fries etc are extra.  2 for lunch with only small sized corned beef sandwiches and one fry order was nearly $30 with tip."}
{"text":"While spending time in Independence OH on business I've had the pleasure of visiting Slyman's Tavern in Rockside Rd.  As you can see from the photo, they're kind of skimpy with the meat (NOT).  Price is reasonable, food is great and how can you not love a place with The Three Stooges on the wall.  When in the area, go to Slyman's Tavern."}
{"text":"I really don't understand the thrill of Slyman's.  It's a cute location.  Now I know I'm only 5'1\" so most bar stools can be a bit of a climb for me to get into but I swear I needed a running jump to get onto this one.  It was loud the night we were there so it was a challenge to talk to others at the table we were seated at.  Service was fairly slow even though the restaurant didn't seem overly busy.  I got a burger and potato pancakes.  Both were okay but nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"Amazing sandwiches! Great portions for the price and super tasty!! Service was attentive, quick and helpful. Will be a go to anytime I'm in the Independence Ohio area!!!"}
{"text":"Panera Is my favorite place to eat! They have the best salads and soups and the cafe always has my favorite soy milk yummmmm"}
{"text":"Went there today around 4:30. Our server Lou was amazing and didn't rush us at all. We like to just take our time, talk and eat. When doing that with 2 kids we usually get the cold shoulder. She was super nice to both my kids and treated them like adults. We will be in again!! Food was delicious as always!!"}
{"text":"Kind of a big let down over all. I don't see the hype or why this place is so expensive. Mashed potatoes taste like they come straight out of a box. Gravy is just as bad. Got the hot turkey dinner. Was just lunch meat turkey that was heated up. Order the red sangria. Had way to much peach schnapps in it. Overall disappointed with the whole experience."}
{"text":"Came for breakfast on MLK day. The food was good and measures up to the original. 2 stars are for the service. The waitress was terrible. Forgot to bring items requested, took forever to take our order, returned only once to ask if we needed refills or check on us. And there were no more than 4 other tables with customers in the entire place. It was not busy at all. Improve the service staff or I will not be returning. I'd rather drive downtown to the original location."}
{"text":"I met a friend for lunch at the Independence. We both had 2 glasses of wine, a cup of beef barley soup, and a BLT sandwich...for total of $51.90! That was an expensive lunch. We both had to ask for extra mayonnaise  on our sandwiches, as they were so dry. The restaurant was very noisy. We definitely had higher expectations."}
{"text":"this place is the bomb. love the sanwiches. corned beef . 
awesome.     and the blueberry beer"}
{"text":"I was foolishly thinking that I was going to walk into a place that resembles the Slyman's in Cleveland.  I was greatly surprised to see a great looking, welcoming, and spacious restaurant with so many TVs. And the food is awesome like the original!  The table shared the Slyman's fries: corned beef shavings, melted swiss topped with green onions.  I got the Turkey SLIMs: melted swiss cheese and cole slaw on toasted pretzel buns.  There was so much food and it was all delicious even the next day as leftovers.  I already have plans to go back next week."}
{"text":"You guys are Sly man, tricking me into thinking you had huge sandwiches.  Got the Pastrami melt, came w/ pickle for a hefty $12!  Meat was good but only 3/4\" high, not like the 2\" the server exclaimed.  Meat had a bit more fat than I'd like & bread wasn't crispy since it was over buttered. But the side salad was very generous for $4 w/ lotsa toppings.  The decor was really nice w/ a full house. 
Summary: pricey, worth another shot but fool me twice.. shame on me!"}
{"text":"There are pastrami sandwiches then there PASTRAMI sandwiches. Slyman's Taverne ranks up with the latter. Slyman's exceeded my expectation in taste and size. It wasn't humungous but it was one of the largest I've had in a while that was tasty as well. 

The carry-out service was quick for a busy lunch time crowd and though a tad pricey, you do get what you pay for so the tad pricey was worth it. 

The only negative is I live 407 miles away"}
{"text":"My wife and I went here after some shopping, it brought back memories of the Old Red Robin that was here before Slyman's. The Cleveland cult following had a good reason as the food was good. I didn't care for crinkle fries and high prices, but the portions were good and the food is fresh. I could also use more variations in sauces. 

Our servers were but you could hear them fighting over tables. I hate hearing people fight over tables to service us. But then again as I usually say we could use one in our area as the food is blah..."}
{"text":"Best corned beef in town! Sunday brunch has bottomless mimosas! If they are serving the chicken paprikash soup order it!!"}
{"text":"Mmmmmmmmmmmm Corned beef mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
I love their corned beef - haven't really tried to get a sandwich on St Paddy's day - I watch that on tv 
But let me tell you they have THE best corned beef 
I didn't care about anything thing else
Corned beef sandwich mmmmmmm"}
{"text":"NOT as good as Slymans in Cleveland.  The corned beef was fine-but nothing to write home about.  not juicy at all.  Big sandwich, but is was $14 so it better be big.  NO side dish at all came with it, not even a drop of potato salad.   The place is a bar. Period.  VERY noisy.  Not a place to go to dinner.  Great if you are drinking and eating together.  Tables are all right by the bar.  MANY high rise tables as well.  My mother ordered a hamburger and was NOT told that they are only cooked well done.  I could not find that on the menu either (if its there-couldnt fine) She cannot chow well done meat.  When we asked server why hamburger was well done, they said it is the ONLY way they cook it.  RIDICULOUS!  
I would not suggest this place."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick bite and we were glad we did. We wanted to check it out since the corned beef sandwiches at the downtown location are excellent! 
We walked in and sat at the bar where we were quickly greeted by the bartender. The atmosphere was sports bar-ish with an open feel. The restaurant was busy and there's a place in the back that will hold larger parties. 
I started off right with a yummy frozen drink that was very good! (forgive me, I can't remember the name) See picture! 
For dinner, I ordered the perogies and my husband ordered the corned beef sandwich with fries.The sandwich was huge and they definitely give you large portions. The perogies were ok...a little bland but still good.
All in all this is a good spot if you're looking for good food with a sport like feel."}
{"text":"Yum & huge - that about says it all.  Slyman's corned beef is famous in Cleveland - always has been & I think it always will be.  The tavern in Independence is a really nice venue with a \"fun & happening\" vibe that you feel when you walk in.  Assorted seating choices - high tops, regular tables, at the bar or on the nice sized patio - should be somewhere for anyone.   The sandwiches are outrageously good &  literally one can be share by 2-3 people.  Try it & you'll be hooked."}
{"text":"Took my son there. Homerun of a place, a true Cleveland original. When there, go for what they are known for - Corned Beef. My son ordered burger - nothing special, average. I ordered corned beef- home run! Go for that!"}
{"text":"We went there on Monday 4-20 and it was the worst Deli experiance of my life. Way over priced and not that good, they spent alot of effort on the buildsing and it is nice inside but $37.00. b for two burgers and fries with cokes is just ridiculous, service was horrible its probly a great place to go have a beer but not to eat nothing like the original Slymans in Cleveland, I would give a lower rating if you had negative stars stay away from this place"}
{"text":"Have not had Slyman's in years...since working downtown!  What a treat!!  You will never find a better Reuben Sandwich than Slymans!!  Best quality lean corned beef ever!!!!"}
{"text":"Great place to eat the food is delicious and you always have extra to take home. I like new location feels homey.our server was super nice. We love this place!slymans fries are sooooo good I recommend..."}
{"text":"Gigantic corned beef sandwiches for my very hungry man.  A warm Fire pit and cocktails served on a lovely outdoor patio for me.  They have it all. We arrived for opening night.  We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"I'm not sure this place will be open this time next year. 
Food just ok, worth the drive to the city for the real thing.
Second and most Important the service is deplorable. The waitress didn't get half the meals correct, forgot one order and spent the night shooting the breeze with the cooks. Two hours for a couple of sandwiches.
I'm going downtown from now on."}
{"text":"Usually lively  and upbeat atmosphere. Today servers all in slow motion and frowny faced. Going home to watch football championship game. This place is a downer. Hostess has an attitude and it's not customer friendly.   Management is slipping, used to love this place. Food still good. Next time we'll get it to go."}
{"text":"Wow! So glad to have Slymans open up here. Great set up! Slymans fries are awesome and the sandwiches are obviously amazing! Wahoo!"}
{"text":"My corned beef sandwich was averagely good. My son ordered a burger from the kids menu, and it was dry, tasteless, and flat as a board. The tavern fries from the appetizer menu were your standard Ore-Ida fries from the grocery store frozen aisle, only with an unidentifiable slop poured over them. My server Holly was pleasant, but couldn't possibly care less about our dissatisfaction. The Halloween decorations were amazing however. If it weren't for that, I would have rated the experience with one star. *sigh*"}
{"text":"Overpriced and average taste at best.  I ordered the \"large\" turkey melt to go and it was a ripoff.  Two normal slices of bread with at most 1/2lb of simple deli turkey.  Why $13 for a small basic panini???"}
{"text":"The food is excellent, but this review is based on the terrible service and experience.

I placed a carry out order 2 hours before pick up time.  When I arrived (on time) I had to wait 10 minutes to be acknowledged by any employee even though I was clearly standing at the carry out order location.  After that I poor for my order.  Then I had to wait over 30 minutes and had to check with 2 employees and then finally a manager before I got my food.

This was a problem because I had guests at my house waiting to eat dinner.  I am glad I did not bring my young kids with me to pick this up because I would have had to walk out.

It's extremely disappointing that a reaturaunt with such a good reputation and good food to have such terrible service.  

I will think twice about ever ordering g a carry out order because they are not deendable on carry out orders."}
{"text":"It's like a deli and a tavern had a baby!!! A big fat delicious baby. Warm and welcoming atmosphere and the staff was fast and friendly. I got hot ham and Swiss and it was as big as my head. You have to get the fries and gravy!!!! Just perfect. Loved how helpful the staff was and went through the menu with me. The Togo area was organized nicely and made me ordering food easy overall had a great experience and will be back for sure."}
{"text":"We were excited to see this restaurant at this location. The excitement didn't last. We ordered our meal and have been waiting forever.  Others that arrived after us are already eating. We seen others served and they are done."}
{"text":"Great big deli sandwiches, the kind you'd expect from the old Carnegie Deli. I got the Pastrami sandwich with coleslaw, my wife got the corned beef, and we shared some fries. It was all really excellent. 

The service was good too. We were seated right away, and our waitress recommended a nice local/regional beer. The \"original\" size sandwiches are large enough to take some home."}
{"text":"What's not to like. Brandon the bar tender is nice and friendly. The corned beef Ruben is awesome and the beer list keeps me interested. Nice environment, lots of tv's to watch sports."}
{"text":"My husband and I love going to Slyman's Tavern! It's a great addition to the independence restaurant scene and it's so nice to be able to get that classic Slyman's corned beef mountain of a sandwich without having to drive downtown. (I actually love the original Slyman's, too, and it's a favorite lunch spot of mine when I work downtown, so no disrespect meant to them at all!)

The standard dinner menu is fantastic. A decent variety of exactly what you'd expect and more. You can get a classic Slyman's corned beef sandwich (the half/small is usually still big enough for two meals for me) and some great salads and dinner plates. Personal favorite appetizers are the pub style pretzels and the sauerkraut balls (they may not sound good to those of us that hadn't heard of these until recently, but they're delicious!). 

Also, they have a great Sunday brunch. It is mostly a buffet (with standards like scrambled eggs, French toast, pancakes, omelette, sausage, bacon, home fries, corned beef hash and more), but they recently added some brunch entrees, too. I haven't personally tried the new entrees yet, but I'm looking forward to going and trying the corned beef eggs Benedict! Definitely check out their Bloody Mary bar while here, too."}
{"text":"Where to start.
I came in and waited 5-7 minutes for the hostess to give me a menu and to direct me to the bar.
I waited another 10 minutes for the girl behind the bar to acknowledge me.
After placing my order she told me that it would be 20-30 minutes to get my order due to the computer not working well.
Having wasted half of my lunch hour already I thanked her for her time only to get a nasty look and a comment that I could not hear.
I'm sure that is was not a \"please come back\"
I understand that sometimes things move slow but the rude comments and look will make sure that I will not recommend Slyman's in independence.
Downtown it's still make the customer happy but I guess not the case here.
Very disappointed."}
{"text":"I give this restaurant a five star review Best corn beef along with the original restaurantin Cleveland."}
{"text":"After hearing Slyman's (a cleveland staple since 1964) had opened a new location we decided to check it out. The place is huge, lots of seating inside, a full bar and nice outdoor patio. A lot of tv's around kinda gives you that sports bar vibe. Stopped in for lunch the place was pretty busy, but we are able to be seated right away. Our server was friendly and took the time to make menu recomendations. 

We decided to order a pub style pretzel, corned beef sandwich and a pastrami sandwich. Now knowing they were busy we expected the kitchen was slammed, but were talking deli sandwiches here, it took 45 minutes for our two sandwiches and a pretzel to arrive. The pretzel was average, a little greasy, seemed like they deep fried it. Now the corned beef sandwich (cold) was huge and tasty and the pastrami sandwich (warm) was delicious as well. The pastrami was definitely smaller in size then the corned beef, but still wonderful. Overall great experience, great sandwiches and we will return when in need of a great sandwich."}
{"text":"Fabulous! Visiting from Dallas, loved the corn beef , toasted with melted cheese! Great service and beautiful atmosphere!
Very very good!"}
{"text":"Ripped Off ... First ...the large corned beef sandwich is about half the size of a large at the St. Clair location. Second ...later checking credit card charges an extra $20 had been added to the bill after completion of the transaction. 3 attempts to contact the GM resulted in no response. Be advise that area from Bahama Breeze to the Extended Stay American Hotel is notorious for criminal activity Slyman's of Orange Place/ Beachwood should be a perfect fit"}
{"text":"Wow I remember the little restaurant downtown. Slymans has grown up. I was afraid that they would have lost some of their appeal but that's not the case. Great location, beautiful restaurant and of course excellent food"}
{"text":"Oh Slyman's and I thought I knew you. I have now been to this location three times and I don't believe I will be returning. The first two times were perfect. I had friends in from out of town for both of those experiences and I am glad they didn't experience what myself and another of my friends did on this third visit. The first two visits the wait staff were great and the food came out super fast and it was super delicious. This third time I swear I was at a completely different restaurant. I want to start by saying what transpired had nothing whatsoever to do with our waitress and I made sure she knew that. So I order the original and it is $14.99 and when it is right it's worth it. So the sandwich comes out and it is cold. Now corned beef is advertised as hot corned beef and no that doesn't mean hot exactly, but it also doesn't mean room temperature. Now (and I hate that restaurants do this) the person who actually brought out our food wasn't our waitress and when I tried to return it at first she wouldn't take it back. She had an attitude which really surprised me because I didn't experience anything like this the first two times I visited. Finally she took it back to the kitchen and quickly they brought me back out the same sandwich now microwaved. You could tell this because some of the corned beef was now well microwaved. I got up then to find a manager who was nowhere to be found. Finally the manager comes to the table and he has an attitude. He tried to explain to me and my friend (both of us Jewish and have eaten corned beef for most of our lives) that unless I ordered it hot it comes out room temperature. Now first this guy wasn't Jewish which is beside the point, but I did find it funny a gentile trying to tell two old Jews hey this is the way corned beef sandwiches are served. No actually you are wrong just go to any Jewish deli where there is a sign clearly advertising hot corned beef sandwiches. So I told him I wasn't eating it and if I wanted sub par service I'd go to Corky's. He then takes the sandwich back and returns with this fatty mess that was now too hot. Nice attitude. I think with this location still being relatively new they really need to check themselves because this is Cleveland and Slyman's is hardly the be all and end all of corned beef (try Mr. Brisket on Taylor which now has seating next door). I actually asked the couple next to me if their corned beef was hot and the woman answered actually no they also noticed it wasn't at the correct temperature. Slyman's you are known for one thing so how about some consistency and please stop with the attitudes because for what you're charging there's no reason nor place for it. Actually there is never a reason for an attitude especially when I know how good these sandwiches can be and for whatever reason on this particular evening this was not the case. Oh and the manager never came back around to apologize or offer something off the bill or heck even a free dessert. One last thing when I mentioned the sandwich was cold the manager asked if I ordered a Corned Beef melt. Slyman's how about getting a manager that knows what a hot corned beef sandwich actually is seeing how your claim to fame is the corned beef? A truly awful experience."}
{"text":"Server was amazing but unfortunately I asked for my sandwich to be hot and had to send it back 2 times. One of the managers had a bit of a attitude which I was surprised. Also the handicap parking is far away from the front door which it was a bit of a task to get my grandmother inside."}
{"text":"What a disappointment this new eatery is. They charge a lot and give less. In the few weeks they have turned off a number of new customers with there customer unfriendly way of doing business. They are acting penny wise and pound foolish. Without going into details, I will no longer patronize this location simply on the matter of principle. They are continuing to lose their clientele. NO worries Corky's and Jack's!!
They are smart assing themselves out of business. Keep it up Slyman's as you are living up to your name."}
{"text":"Love the location and resturant. Sandwiches are smaller then the one from St Clair location. Beers and ciders good. They carry a lot of local brewery drinks which was nice to see. We got seated right away and service was pretty good. I will go again."}
{"text":"Meh. The food was nothing to write home about. I'm not a Cleveland native, so my opinion is unbiased and my only comparison is Superior Deli so far. The service was...umm...I wouldn't want her to be my server again. She was too comfortable because we \"looked alike\" and her service reflected  her level of comfort. She mixed up the order (mistakes happen) because there was no way to determine what was what. Although we ordered different cheeses on the corned beef, they tasted the same to me after we switched plates. Lol The sandwich wasn't as big as I expected. I bit it with no problem- not having to remove any meat. 
This is one of those places that you try once to say that you went. It wouldn't be my first option to return, but I wouldn't be disappointed if i ate there again."}
{"text":"I am being respectful at three stars.  Came early for lunch and a
 Sat at bar. Ordered a cup of soup and a light corned beef sandwich. 
Before the second spoon of soup hit my lips, the sandwich showed up. 
Soup was ok, but by the time I got to my Sammy, it was cold. 
For starters, definitely not the mother ship. Besides being cold it was sliced thicker and lacked the tenderness and flavor I have been used to for 38 years. After choking down half the sandwich, the barmaid was MIA for over15 minutes. In the interim, I watched another gal behind the bar eating and ignoring me. At this point, I just wanted to cut my loss and get moving. After 5 more minutes, my gal showed up. I asked for a check and a to go box, not sure why. She never asked how it was nor did I get the feeling she cared. I tried. It is not st Clair and will NEVER be. Good luck with the independence crowd. I am sure it will be successful despite its shortcomings. No feel. Just attitude.....sorry. Truly sorry."}
{"text":"The Saint Clair location should go into the restaurant/deli hall of fame (if there actually is one), but the Beachwood location wouldn't be allowed in the parking lot. I was in a word, underwhelmed by this Slyman's location. 

The food was okay, but when your pastrami comes out cold, you know you're in for a bumpy experience. The service was clumsy and the atmosphere was a little tense and unfriendly. Too bad because this is a great location right off I-271 and Harvard. Try to be more like the Saint Clair location and you'll have a shot"}
{"text":"I have no regrets or complaints. The deal they run with free slymans fries with an entree is more than worth it. Those fries are worth driving an hour for! And that's exactly what I'm doing tomorrow!"}
{"text":"I feel very meh about this. They did a great job restructuring the restaurant to not feel like Ruby Tuesday anymore and it is a cool look and vibe. 

We went during brunch time but ordered off the full menu except for the kid with us who ordered the brunch buffet. The buffet wasn't great. The bagels were literally so hard we could have used them as a hammer and it wasn't a super awesome variety. Kind of felt like a hotel breakfast buffet.

The service was meh as well. Our server didn't seem interested in checking in on us and we were in need of water multiple times and didn't get refills. 

The sandwiches were as good as ever though so if you are going for that its a win and the grilled cheese meal was super valuable for the money."}
{"text":"I could say that they have really good corned beef...which is their Claim to Fame...justifiably.

I could also say that they have good bartenders, good management and good service...but I would be lying!

Maggie who \"tends bar\", or thinks she does is a disgrace. She does not know what a martini is, how to make one or in which glass to pour it... CANCEL...have a damn beer... I think she can pull the tap... with limited training as a mixologist.

She watered down a 1oz pour!!! and LIED on me that I drank it ....
Then she charged me for the drink I never drank and when I questioned it, called... the big fat obnoxious and unprofessional \"manager\" Christine (like the possessed vehicle in the Steven King movie) to tag team on the situation.

I only am disrespectful because these two misfits were exactly that..disrespectful, confrontational, unprofessional and seemed very misguided...who argues with a customer over what obviously was wrong from the beginning and never made it right?
TRASH!

My friend and I just left not wanting a scene with obvious trash and I will never visit, refer, mention this place to anyone again.  Not worth the unhealthy calories, disrespect, tacky, uncomfortable behavior or low class service.....and I DO MEAN LOW CLASS... I know the difference!"}
{"text":"Awesome experience! I sat at the bar and Brandi served me. I had the Original Corned Beef on Rye and it was simply amazing. Portion to feed 2 regular people. I have eaten Corned Beef around the world and this is simply supreme over EVEN NYC delis!

My only comment to the management is about the 'Krinkle fries', really? Step up your fry-game to fresh-cut fries! Anyone can make 'Ore-Ida' at home. They were bland and took away from the rest of the awesomeness that was your sandwich. This review would have been 5 stars if the fries weren't 'meh'."}
{"text":"We have always dined at Slymans deli on St. Clair.  We were in the area and decided to try Slymans Tavern in Independence.  We liked the decor and our waitress.  However the Sunday buffet was a big disappointment.  I got in line at 1130am to try it.   All of the chafing dishes were empty.  And not just for 5 min but upwards of 20 min.  I decided to order from the menu instead. We watched countless patrons lift the lids and try to scrape up anything they could.  Most just opened and closed the lids all the way down the line.  Seems as though all that was available was sausage and bacon.  The couple next to us kept getting apologies from the same waitress we had about the buffet.  I told my husband if Freddie from Slymans in Cleveland was here this would not be happening.  I think he would have been appalled.  I'm giving 4 stars because our sandwiches were great and our waitress was too.  I mentioned the buffet to her and said I want to bring my family here on a Sunday but not if the buffet has no food and the omelette  bar was behind too.  She said she had no idea as to what happened in the kitchen today..."}
{"text":"Not a well planned layout. It's a loud building. You have to get around a line of people who are waiting for take out just to wait to be seated. The pickle isn't crisp, its gummy.  Beverages were slow to arrive to the table and slow receiving refills.  The corned beef is greasy.  No reason to return."}
{"text":"Mmmmmmm corned beef.   I visited Cleveland recently on a business trip. Seeing as it was my first trip there and the fact that I apparently live for food, I searched for what the must-have item was. Slyman's huge corned beef sandwiches came up front and center. Challenge accepted...  Due to the main location having only breakfast/lunch hours and my work schedule I had no choice but to give their second, bar-style location a try.  I looked at the reviews prior to arriving and saw mention of smaller sandwiches at the \"Tavern\" so I came with slightly lowered expectations. 
Anyway, customer service was great - smiles all around and the wait staff was quick and efficient. 
My waiter didn't miss a beat although my order was pretty customized.
The food was also good; very good. It just wasn't quite what I was expecting. The appearance in my case was better than the actual taste. Easy to do because my plate looked glorious in my opinion. My corned beef melt had all the flavor I expected (especially with the spicy mustard I threw on there), but it wasn't hot. It was...medium warm. Not a big deal, but it definitely took away from the experience.  The Slyman's fries were hot, but the flavor was mostly missing; the opposite of my sandwich.  I found the melted swiss on the fries to be a bit bland honestly and the fries with no topping had no seasoning. BUT the fries (normally $8.99) were free for checking in on Yelp. It's kind of hard to complain about free stuff. I will also say that the portion sizes here are definitely bigger than most can handle.  The fries were LOADED with corned beef and cheese. This place did not skimp! My sandwich was huge too!  At no point was I able to fit it in my mouth from top to bottom. And size does matter right?! ;) 
At the end of the day, this spot is a great place to get a few drinks with the crew and some good eats while watching the game (the Cavs game of course )."}
{"text":"Going to the original Slymans is pretty cool, but the new one is just annoying.  The new location is overpriced and not nearly as good as Corky and Lenny's which is less than half a mile away from this one."}
{"text":"This is a must visit for anyone coming to town and is a local Cleveland favorite for delicious Corned Beef! Corned beef is delicious and lean and they have a great beer selection. Great location in Independence right off the freeway, super convenient for meeting up with friends for a meal after work!"}
{"text":"At this point in time, how is it possible for a sandwich place to NOT offer gluten free bread?"}
{"text":"Slymans is a deli masquerading as a tavern. It was over-priced and underwhelming.  The menu is full of deli sandwiches, which come with a small, sweet pickle.  Sides are extra.  We ordered a cheeseburger with fries and a BBQ beef sandwich with slaw.  My dining companion reported the burger and fries were fine but underwhelming.  The BBQ sandwich is heaped with meat and smothered with sauce.  They even pour extra sauce all over the top of the bun.  I can't really call it a sandwich because with the amount of sauce covering the bun I had to eat the meat with a fork.  Its perfect if you are on a low carb diet.  I could have gone for it, taking the BBQ slathered bun in hand  and covering my hands in the sticky sweet sauce but they only give you one napkin and good luck finding a server to ask for more.  The meat was slow cooked and melt in your mouth, but due to the over abundance of sweet, tangy BBQ sauce you lose almost all of the meat's natural flavor.  The sauce is so sweet and overpowering it becomes too much about half way through.  If you enjoy a pile of meat smothered in sauce then you might like it.  The slaw was bland.

Service was ok to start.  We got our drinks right away and were able to order fairly quickly.  The runner brought out our food, asking who got each dish before hastily putting them down in front of the wring person.  With only two of us she had a 50-50 shot, its not like we indicated who got which order, wait yeah we did. It was almost like why bother to pretend.  Refills were slow or non existant.  I guess its hard to tell when a clear liquid like water is too low.

On the bright side the restaurant has a nice ambiance, seemed clean, and had lots of tvs to watch the game.  That's about it."}
{"text":"Hands down the best corned beef!  I finally got around to trying it and I was blown away by how good the food was here!  The service was also fantastic!  Outstanding experience!"}
{"text":"No breakfast menu on Sundays, just their buffet which is overpriced and very mediocre.   The eggs, even though had cheese and peppers and tomatoes in them, had absolutely no flavor, the corned beef hash was dry, even after they brought out what appeared to be a fresh tray of corned beef hash, it was still dry and seemed like it had been sitting there for a while.  Took over 10 minutes to get someone to take our drinks and even then we had to call the person over to order coffee and orange juice, and they were not too pleased about having to help another table.  Got their corn beef sandwich to go, it is piled high for sure & the corn beef had good flavor, but was also dry. Overall they are overpriced, the service is pretty poor as is the food."}
{"text":"An institution in town which is known for slinging roast beef. It has the feel of a modern brew pub with 15ish local beers on tap with a large selection of bottles and wine in reserve. Besides excellent roast beef there are other Cleveland favorites such as potato pancakes and perogies."}
{"text":"Ate at this  deli Tavern style restaurant by recommendation of a friend. Was an outstanding experience the pastrami sandwiches are what they are known for an out of this world. This place was decorated very nicely for Halloween and had a super warm and fun atmosphere. Would highly recommend visiting this location if you have not already. Many many  draft selections for beer lovers as well."}
{"text":"Read the reviews and they are spot on. Should of listened to them. Got in quick. Sauerkraut balls came out fast and were delicious. Then waited over an hr for sandwiches supposively almost done. Then they said mix up in kitchen. They were apologizing to everyone because of the slow service wasn't just us. Left and right mistakes. Food was good when it came out but not worth the wait and confusion."}
{"text":"Love Slyman's pastrami sandwiches. They are delicious when you get them grilled with cheese. Great food, service and environment. Highly recommended! Thry have several locations so look for them when you're in Cleveland"}
{"text":"Meat Lovers Heaven! This is the place to go if you love a beefy sandwich. Tried the corned beef and the pastrami and they were both delicious. I love a good corned beef sandwich and this one did not disappoint. The mean was lean the sandwich was filling and there were lots of add on options. I was trying to be low key but couldn't help but notice all the delicious looking food the people around me ordered. The loaded fries with corned beef on them looked like the perfect appetizer for a group of people. I thought the brunch deal on Sunday was a steal. Endless mimosas and all your breakfast favorites if I had to guess I'd say the corned beef has was delicious. I'm certainly going back with a game plan. Eat brunch and take a sandwich to go. They have 2 sizes so you can keep it light or go the distance. The drink menu was impressive as well. I would put this on my list for brunch,  lunch or dinner. The staff was friendly,  restaurant was spacious,  clean and they have a mural of the 3 Stooges on the wall. They have nice memorabilia on the wall and it's done tasteful there's no clutter. They have 2 locations. Downtown Cleveland and Independence. I went to Independence but will certainly stop Downtown whenever I'm in the area. This is a must when you're in Cleveland...its a winner!"}
{"text":"This place brought the nostalgia and tradition of Slyman's Downtown and brought it (and then some) to the suburbs. The food is exceptional, the service is great and the bar area is ridiculous - especially when the weather is nice. If you are anywhere near Independence or Rockside Road, this place is an absolute must. Tell them Billl sent ya. And ask to sit in Amber's section."}
{"text":"If you love corned beef, this is your place! After living in Cleveland most of my life, I can't believe I've never been here before!  I came in with my family for dinner tonight and we had a feast. We ordered two large Reuben's, a small turkey sandwich, two soups, coleslaw, and Slyman's fries. Holy cow. The fries were so good. Everything was so good, really. 
Our server was also really nice and did a great job of explaining the menu to us."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere trendy decorations,  30 beer taps and nice selection of bottled craft beers. Huge portions. Machine sliced corned beef stacked on rye, big enough to share.  Had no problem finding a seat at lunch even though it was busy. Fast service with a smile."}
{"text":"As much as people hype this place up I'm so not impressed. My first experience was carry-out. I ordered a corn beef Reuben and club turkey. I ordered and paid online. While I did not dine in I had to wait nearly 15 minutes for my food. I wasn't alone another gentleman was there and had been waiting longer. The atmosphere seemed typical of any chain restaurant. I figure it's a good spot for an internet meet and greet, not so much as a date night. The server asked for my name and printed out my check. I signed and returned it to her. She looked at the check and then back up at me as if she was feeling some kind of way about me not leaving a tip. Excuse me ...I ordered online and paid online and the cook prepared my food what am I tipping you for? Nonetheless, I received my food and drove home. They got our order WRONG! We got a plain corn beef sandwich and my turkey club was dry. I specifically asked for mayo on the side and received none. There was nothing special about the sandwiches that warrant $15 each, thus I was disappointed and certainly glad I didn't leave a tip that was not deserved."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a Sunday afternoon for lunch as a party of 5.  We were seated at a high table, which would usually be ok except that one of our group was a toddler. Not a deal breaker, just had to pay a little extra attention to make sure he didn't fall.

They had run out of kids' menus, and we didn't know they had smaller options until we asked. (It would've been nice to hear from the hostess that the children's menus were available.)

We ordered drinks, which took awhile to come out. Apparently the bar had a hard time finding the beers we wanted. So, inconvenience, but not a deal breaker.

Our entrees came quickly after ordering.  However, the kitchen messed up the kid's meal by forgetting the fries. We had the sandwich only, which they placed in front of our son AND THEN TOOK AWAY. We had manage him to avoid a meltdown and then wait until his food was remade. 

Once everything came out it was really good. Corned beef is as good as it had ever been at the downtown location. The onion rings were perfectly fried and weren't greasy at all. The food is not the issue. 

Cheryl was fantastic and worked very hard to make everything right for us. Had it not been for her, this review world have likely been 1 star. 

I hope the kitchen gets its act together because they truly have some great food based on the Slyman's name. Unfortunately, I refuse to eat my corned beef with a side of confusion and frustration."}
{"text":"Went around 8pm on Saturday wasn't very busy. Had to wait to be seated while 3 waitresses stood around. When we finally were seated had to wait again for a least 5 minutes to have our drink order. That again took awhile. There was about 20 people in the restaurant and we counted 6 servers. And not one of them at a table! Not sure where they went in the back or what. When we ordered and received our food once again that took awhile. The food was cold and fries some were still frozen! Then again had to wait for horseradish and refill on drinks. Food was horrible! Service was horrendous! We will never go there again .they shouldn't even attempted to mess with the Cleveland original!"}
{"text":"Great sandwiches and the Bloody Mary is delicious I recommend it to anyone who loves corned beef stacked high.  Skip the fries they aren't that good"}
{"text":"Finally made it here just before leaving to head back to the desert. The sandwiches were huge!  Easily split the lite (smaller portion) Ruben for lunch.  Only a pickle come with your sandwich, so don't forget to pick a side to share.  The sauerkraut balls were awesome would get those in a heartbeat again.  The service was good, and the restaurant has a glassed in atrium that I guess they open for the summer.  The only down fall is the hot sandwiches were Luke warm.  We sent the grilled cheese back, it was barely melted.  The Ruben was ok \"warm\".  When I return I want to try the BLT it looks a awesome!"}
{"text":"While our family and I have always enjoyed the food, our experience with the service recently had us feel like the \"customer\" isn't considered important.

On our most recent trip, the hostess sat the 4 of us at a table and gave us all adult menus - clearly we had kids (ages 4 and 6 with us) that would've easily constituted kids menus. So I had to go and ask...only to not be acknowledged then I found them in the hostess stand. Secondly, when I ordered a chocolate milk for one child the server said she didn't have that. I asked if there was white milk - she said \"yes\" at to which I asked if the bar had choc syrup (this also should be stated the table directly beside us had a child with choc milk). Once she put two and two together she told me that she could indeed support that request.

We ordered our food, which included an appetizer and sandwiches. While it took a bit of time for our food to arrive, when it did we never got the appetizer and I had to ask about it. We were asked by the person (not our server) if we still wanted it...which indeed we did. Next we never saw our server except towards the very end of our meal. This was after I had to flag down a hostess to bring thousand island to go with my Rueben. When she did return, she refilled our drinks and we asked for the check - again not knowing when we might see her again. 

When we paid and she brought the receipt for our charges there was no \"thank you\" no appreciation. We also was charged for the appetizer. 

While the food is good, I really try to spend my money where the service is decent and as customers we are appreciated."}
{"text":"It's really unfortunate to have to say this, as Slyman's is such a Cleveland staple, but I just can't bring myself to go back here. I get that the sandwich costs should be similar to downtown's, that's not what I'm frustrated with, but EVERYTHING else is so overpriced. Appetizers, drinks, additional entrees... all of it. Not only is it overpriced, but the quality is mediocre at best. 

There are some nice and friendly people on the staff, but you can sense, and sometimes hear the drama between everyone (like when you walk out of the bathrooms). 

I think because this is somewhat a separate entity from
Downtown (from what the staff there explained) it makes more sense that the management is significantly less than stellar. 

When the food truck first launched, I called to inquire about prices and how it worked and the person I spoke with was so great and we had the truck out to our business within a few weeks. I tried to get it out this past summer and no one got back to me and I was given the runaround about who to talk to. 

It's truly unfortunate because I just can't go back there because of the experiences I've had. It puts a bad taste in my mouth for the whole Slyman's name."}
{"text":"The patio is unbeatable and the draft beer selection is fantastic. I love that you can get corned beef shavings to go to make hash at home. Good people and good food. They do good corned beef but the fries are great and so are the wings."}
{"text":"Great place with friendly staff, excellent corned beef and a retractable skylight too."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now, and the experience is consistently negative. Nice atmosphere, but the service is slow and loopy. Both visits the servers were slow with plenty of empty tables and orders were not brought out correctly and we were not asked, \"How is everything?\" You'd think that's Server 101, but it's not at Slyman's Tavern. Slyman's has potential and with new eateries opening nearby, I hope that's the wakeup call to step it up."}
{"text":"Great ambiance but the service was slow, the portions small and the ala carte menu pricing was ridiculous - two lite sandwiches, a shared order of undercooked fries and two cokes - $32 before the tip!!! Will not come back!"}
{"text":"I was thrilled when Slyman's Tavern opened up just a few minutes from my house. The patio there is beautiful and the service is great! I typically get the corned beef mighty melt. The corned beef is the best and the portion is plentiful. Most times I'm able to get two meals. The mashed potatoes are also amazing and the fried pickles are a great starter!  The only reason I didn't give a 5 star is due to the fact that I find the sandwiches to be a bit pricey and they don't come with a side buuutttt I guess you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"Not one speck of false advertising here! The sandwiches were huuuuge! My kids ate corned beef for the first time. I couldn't keep them away from my plate. They kept snitching meat! The Slyman's Fries were out of this world! Flavor bomb! Yum!"}
{"text":"Went here during the week around lunch time with some co-workers and this place is definitely A-OK! The inside is a lot more modern with a ton more space than the original location and if you're into sports you'll love the twenty or so TV's everywhere (maybe that is why 85% of the patrons where men? Or men just really like their meat?). I got the lighter version of the corned beef reuben and it did not disappoint with it's grilled rye bread, sauerkraut, swiss cheese and buttery smooth corned beef (you'll get the thousand island dressing on the side). Even the lighter version has enough meat for 1 1/2 sandwiches! But don't think that isn't included in the price; you're looking at $11.50 for just a sandwich with half a pickle spear so don't come here looking for a cheap food deal. Oh and if you pay in cash you won't get coins for change as the waiter only has paper money -  I thought this was weird, but I guess it's an accepted practice.

Overall I would come back!"}
{"text":"Reuben was fantastic, and the Slyman's Fries were fan-freaking-tastic.  Although I love the original location, I would much rather take my chances here, where there aren't long lines."}
{"text":"Food was very good.   Had their corned beef sandwich."}
{"text":"Although the corned beef was good, this was the only pleasure in this visit.  It's not a deli- it's a suburban sports bar with all the TV sets and coldness that implies.  The staff was not friendly.  We had to ask for utensils after the food was delivered.  No one asked if we needed anything- there were no drink refills. The server could not snatch my plate fast enough even though I was saving my pickle for last!  We were seated at a table surrounded on two sides by high tables- and it felt claustrophobic.  Even though we were close to a fireplace, a draft swirled around my legs.  

No warmth here- no eye contact. No smiles.  The sandwich was uninspired.  

Many of you will like the sports bar atmosphere and order beer and a burger.  It's not for me- we spent too much for some corned beef and nothing else.  Even though it's quirky, next time I will opt for Corky & Lenny's at the next exit."}
{"text":"TAKE OUT ORDER - They needed my credit card number over the phone, with expiration date and pin number.  When I arrived, the lady at the cash register requested my credit card. I told her that I gave all my information on the phone.  She looked through some hand written orders and found my order with credit card info written on it and punched it in.  I asked her what does she do with the info.  She stated that she destroys it.  I asked her for the paper so I could destroy it myself.  Cheesecake Factory doesn't do this.  Why do I want my credit card number lying around."}
{"text":"We got horrible service in the Flats. Walked out and drove to Slyman's. They totally set us up. Great service, great food. Totally recommend."}
{"text":"My dad and myself and my daughter who is 6 try to do lunch at least once a week. Today was a great day to take a little ride and try out the new Slymans tavern I thought so my dad said let's go. Place was really cool inside I had eaten at the previous place and what a training wreck that was all new. We were seated  on kids menu for my daughter given but I asked anyway and 1 was provided. I always order the corned beef or ruben so today I went with the ruben. My dad went with the club sandwich and my daughter of course chicken fingers. I thought the Reubens looked great pickle rocked forgot our frys no biggie our waitress was awesome. But 45.00 for 2 sandwiches and 2 drinks and a kids meal ehh I think they priced themselves way to high and time will tell if people will pay 15.50 for a sandwich w/o the frys 3.00 more for frys so 18.50 for a sandwich and frys idk but I won't pay it again. I wish them luck though."}
{"text":"Arrived about 2:30 for lunch. Seated right away and served quickly. My chicken barley soup was cold. Corned beef was lean the way we like it. Overall just an ok experience. The restaurant floor was dirty, table was sticky. $14.95 seems high for a sandwich with unremarkable rye bread and a pickle. Corky and Lenny's a better value, has better menu selections and excellent hot soups."}
{"text":"6 of us had dinner here last night. All of us loved it. The ambiance is cool. I had the Reuben and it was great but it would be nice if they grilled the bread instead of just toasting it. And when you're paying that much for a sandwich it'd be nice if fries were included. I don't like being nickeled and dimed to death. But I was very happy with the huge pickle!!  I'm definitely coming back. It was great!!"}
{"text":"Food was fair, service was bad. Our waitress forgot two orders of food and disappeared, We had to look for someone to give us silverware so we could eat.  That person also brought out the missing food but spilled one order all over the table. 

An 18% gratuity was added to our bill automatically for our party of 7.  I paid in cash and was expecting a few bucks back. The waitress dropped off the credit card receipts and disappeared again, keeping my cash without even asking if I wanted the change back (I did since the 18% tip was already added into my check.)  

The general consensus was that the food was mediocre, definitely not worth the terrible service."}
{"text":"After being seated for over 15 minutes and never being greeted by a waiter, I got up and decided to take my business elsewhere. This is my 2nd consecutive visit to this location with a similar experience!

Here's the funny part this time ... I asked to speak with the manager to voice my complaint and quickly learned that she was seated literally 12 feet from me in the same seating area. I'm confident she saw me sitting there and never said a word. She must've been on her break because she was on a sandwich and just chilled the hell out.

Those of you willing to wait forever to be served, you'll find the corned beef to be very good and plentiful. Just know that the service here is horrible!!!

Best wishes to this location. I won't be back!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in at 11pm on a Tuesday night. I live in CBUS, so whenever I am in Cleveland (usually for a show or a game), I can never make it to Slymans because of their hours. So, this place is a godsend for that reason. They are open late AND! is on the way home to Columbus from Cleveland. Double-score. 

Now, onto the food. I hold the reuben at the original Slyman's on a very high pedestal. In fact, I rate it the #1 reuben Ive ever had -- and yes, Ive trid Katz's in NYC, just my personal preference. I prefer it sliced thin and piled high -- and that moist corned beef! Oh! Its heaven! LOVE Slymans.

THIS PLACE -- the corned beef was NOT the same. If it was the same, it was cooked slightly differently. It was still very good, but very good does not match the original Slymans. Slymans is beyond excellent.  Some say it was dry, and yeah, I guess you could call it that, but the taste was a tad bit off for me. The portion was about 15 to 20% smaller than that of the original location and was priced exactly the same. I know, $15.50 for a sandwich is ridiculous, BUT Slymans is worth it. This place, I dont know. Maybe if they included a side. The reason I know? I was still hungry after eating it. I was eating off of my gf's plate including her french fries. The original Slyman's, I never do that. Im stuffed after JUST the sandwich and never need sides, other than a water or can of Coke. 

My recommendation -- use the same bread the original location uses and use the same portions. If you are going to charge the same, provide the same. Its not fair to the customers. Will I be back? Sure. Will I rush to go back? No. Its not the same. Not yet. I had heard Freddy was working at this location to get them started on the right foot. Maybe its time to call him back. Ill include some pictures. 

Btw, our bill was $32.55 and included one hamburger, one reuben, one order of french fries, and one coke. Yikes!"}
{"text":"Having gotten take out downtown, we were looking forward to trying here. Food was expensive and not that good.  They're getting by from the name. Avoid"}
{"text":"OK, so the corned beef  sandwiches  and veggie burgers are awesome. BUT, the restaurant is NOT clean, the bathrooms are disgusting (smelled and sinks filthy), the floors are not clean.  The bread is store bought rye..I mean, you can't get good home made Jewish rye bread for a Jewish deli?  The waitstaff was pleasant and efficient but over all, it was disappointing, especially how the restaurant is kept up.  If what you see is that dirty, what about what you can't see...the kitchen????"}
{"text":"Overpriced. Wine 9 bucks?! I can get better quality down the street at Lockkeepers and better price. I've waited to try to give this place a chance. This is my 3rd time. Bartender, Amy was fantastic. 
Usually service is terrible. Fries were old. Will not be back."}
{"text":"Slymans in Orange Place  corned beef was terrible, small and over priced!! Superior restaurant is by far the best place for tender huge corned beef ..."}
{"text":"So this is the fabulous Slyman's whose corned beef is \"legendary?\" I think not!  I had never been to the original place, or the newer one on Rockside, but when this location opened I couldn't resist.  The sandwiches are New York size, but I prefer quality over quantity."}
{"text":"Same family as downtown and same surly service. The meat was quite fat and rolled in my mouth, the bread was sticky and we were packed in like sardines. They used to own Matina's bridal and the owner's wife was always arrogant to the customers. Perhaps she's heading up the service training at this location? We do have choices when we eat out and being treated poorly by people behind the counter and wait staff is simply not acceptable. Not going back. I'll make my own corned beef at home thank you very much."}
{"text":"I know that everyone loves their sandwiches, but let's talk about their potato pancakes!  They are my favorite and I come here just to get them.  Their loaded latkes are warm, comforting and crispy.  They serve it with corned beef and cheese on top!  So good!  Please try these!"}
{"text":"We stopped in for a late lunch on a Saturday on a recommendation from local. We split the loaded latkes, topped with corn beef, melted Swiss cheese and green onions as well as a \"melt\" consisting of pastrami and Swiss on rye. Last minute my husband eyed another table get onion rings delivered so we needed an order of those as well. They came very quick with a lovely remoulade sauce. The rings them selves weren't anything to write home about other than being very hot and crunchy. They had basic panko breading but they satisfied the \"bar food\" craving the hubby had. The sandwich was disappointing as it was incredibly greasy. It was nice and hot, but just dripping with grease. Won't do that again. Surprisingly my favorite was the loaded latkes! Warm chopped bits of corned beef and melts cheese on top. Served with a side of sour cream and your choice to add the raw horseradish that sits on the table to it! 

Service was quick and friendly, food was good for the most part, especially if you are looking for the \"bar food\" category."}
{"text":"Walking in u can tell they spent time on the design.  It is very nice inside. The staff is on point. The food is what u have come to expect from this great cleveland family.  They have a winner here.  Corned beef melt is outrageous and sly man fries.   Way good."}
{"text":"I arrived at 1 PM yesterday, thinking, \"Uh oh!\" upon seeing the jam-packed parking lot.  I took a chance and went inside and left my name after being told that, as a party of one, I would be waiting 15 minutes to a half hour.  I found a seat on a bench and thought I should be looking at the menu while I was waiting, so I returned meaning to ask for one, and I was seated immediately!  I guess you can never tell how things are going to work out!
My daugher used to work in Cleveland and regularly went to the Slyman's there, raving about how fabulous the food was.  Trouble is that my husband and I could never get there during the hours they are open; we live a 90 minute drive away..  Yesterday I happened to have an appointment in Beachwood and saw the restaurant from 271, and asked the man I had an appointment with if this was really the same Slyman's.  He confirmed my hopes, and I went directly there after my appointment.  The food was as wonderful as I had heard.  I got a full-sized corned beef sandwich (reasonably priced; similar ones I've bought in NYC cost twice as much!) so I could take home the other half for my husband.  Oh my goodness.  That meat just melted in my mouth!  I'm so glad I didn't get any other stuff on it; that way I was able to enjoy the meaty goodness unadulterated, except for some horseradish (come on!  Horseradish is essential!).
I have another Cleveland area appointment on Wednesday; I believe I'll be stopping in again!"}
{"text":"It's a good spot to eat at. I especially like the bar and that it's way bigger than the location off St.Clair. But still the SLYMANS on St.Clair has the better sandwich. Not saying this place sandwich is bad, it's good.."}
{"text":"Amazing place to eat. Great service. Great atmosphere. Great beer selection. Literally the best Reuben ever! Can't wait to go back! Check it out."}
{"text":"I have been to slymans downtown and that place was awesome; so this one is closer to my house and I decided to come here to check it out with my buddy. We came in and sat at the bar and the service was top notch. The bartender was quick with drinks and quick to give us the menu and tell us about their food and recommendations. We ordered a couple drinks which came out quickly and ordered the classic corned beef with mashed potatoes and my buddy got the same thing with French fries. The corned beef sandwich was just ok so definitely a disappointment as the one down town tastes better; the mashed potatoes were awesome though. They are a 3.5-4 star place because the service was good despite it being busy and the decor was new (lots of wood everywhere) and there were a ton of tvs with the games on."}
{"text":"Ok so my point of reference when it comes to corned beef and pastrami is Katz Deli in New York. No one is going to beat that but this place is amazing. Since every review raved about the corned bed I had to try it but I am a pastrami guy. I talked my buddy into splitting one of each. Both were phenomenal but the grilled pastrami Ruben style was off the charts. So don't forget about the pastrami."}
{"text":"This was such a disappointing experience. 

Service was great. However, our server made it perfectly clear, it was the bartenders fault the beer took too long. A bit inappropriate. 

The restaurant was clean. The staff was friendly. However, the food was NOT good at all. Store bought French fries and dried up corned beef. Barely any krout and the bread was soggy. 

This makes me so sad. We allow 1 cheat day a week. This one sucked!

Boil the corned beef! 

We won't be returning :("}
{"text":"Have a group of 10!  Wanted to make a reservation and they would not take any reservation.    Thought that was kind of unusual for the area!   Was very disappointed.  Our group can have their luncheon another place."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere and he slide back porch area! Service is always spot on & I love their corn beef! Their potato latkes are very good too. Their French fries are the only mediocre thing I've had here. But I'd say Slymans is a solid goto!"}
{"text":"Slyman's Tavern is a solid 4 stars.

I had a 1/2 corned beef reuben sandwich.  As others have noted, the full size sandwich is easily enough for two people.  The corned beef was as good as advertised, but the sauerkraut was very lacking in flavor.

I also had the Slyman's Fries.  This is a large order of fries that are loaded with corned beef, cheese, and topped with what I think were green onions.  If I had known what how good this item tastes and how big it was, I would have skipped the reuben and just ordered this with a side salad.

The other issue with this place was the service at the bar.  It wasn't really that bad, but it took quite a bit of time to get my order in.  It also took quite a bit of time to get my check when I was finished.  Part of this was due to the 2 bartenders not covering for each other, which may have been due to the way tips are distributed.

All in all, I'd go back, but I'd sit at a table and skip the reuben."}
{"text":"The best corned beef sandwich I've eaten. Friendly family atmosphere. Owner or manager sat down to talk to us and mentioned how good their egg salad was. Next thing we know, he brought us a sample to taste. Corned beef was great and the potatoe salad is definitely homemade. Outstanding."}
{"text":"We have been here a few times.   We always have good service and we love the corned beef sandwiches and the pretzel!!! You must get the pretzel!  The best pretzel we've ever had!!"}
{"text":"I read a bunch of reviews for this place on the way since we were being taken out to lunch by a customer, four people in total.  The service won't be as bad as I'm reading I thought, especially since were getting there at 11:30.

Fifty minutes later and after multiple tables with more people sat down after us were served, and we asked our waitress multiple times what was going on, our food finally came out. It was good, I split a Reuben and a corned beef sandwich with a companion. I wish it was cut thicker, but otherwise it was almost everything a Jewish deli sandwich can be (Katz is everything it can be).

I didn't get fries or a side after reviews said they were phoned in and it was a good call considering it leaves more room for corned beef.

Overall, the long wait for the food soured the experience and forced us to scarf it down since we were almost late for an appointment. Yelp was right on about this place.

For what it's worth, our Italian colleague couldn't believe how large the sandwiches were. Go America!"}
{"text":"This place is hit or miss and lately it has been more of a miss.   I went today and spent $45 on flavorless food.  The Corned beef had NO flavor."}
{"text":"stars for the delicious food and very kind server. your hostess leaves something to be desired - everything was a chore, very unpleasant. eye-rolling. didn't offer a high chair for our baby. cut me off as i was walking (which blocked me from reaching said baby), etc. not cool."}
{"text":"We asked not to be sat in the sun and the hostess had an attitude. I call to speak with the manager and was told she couldn't do any thing about it and hung up on me. Go here only if you don't expect polite customer service!"}
{"text":"The food is alright.  I tired their club which is marked as a favorite and I expected a lot for a 14 dollar sandwich but was disappointed.  Not worth the price."}
{"text":"We stopped in on a chilly Saturday afternoon for the first time ever. I work downtown and occasionally the group at work orders take out from the main location, so I know the food is awesome. But, this place is a really nice bar experince too. We stoolled up and Maggie took care of us right away. She answered my beer questions and then gave us chapter and verse on the menu. Fast service with both food and booze, friendly and knowledgable (but not overly chatty) bartenders and just a really fun afternoon drinking and eating experience. You should try it."}
{"text":"Who doesn't love slymans? The corn beef is by far the best in Cleveland. If you haven't been you're doing your taste buds a disservice!"}
{"text":"Food is great, service is good, beer is cold. The only thing missing is atmosphere. How about you put the lights on a timer to dim after 6pm? I can't relax with a beer on a Friday night when it feels like I'm sitting in a cafeteria. 
Update: returned again to Slyman's Tavern during Lent. Lights dimmed at about 7pm!  Asked the server if this was a new development and she said the general manager dims the lights when she's there! Same awesome food, better ambience!"}
{"text":"The Slyman Fries are AMAZING!!! Cleveland is known for there corned beef and this is the place to go. The prices are pretty fair with how much they serve. The corned beef sandwich can be eaten by 2 definitely. Customer Service was great and very attentive."}
{"text":"Had some sort of Turkey club sandwich and it was awesome...service was great and everyone was very friendly"}
{"text":"The restaurant is beautiful! Fantastic atmosphere and a HUGE sunroom! The food is what you expect from this Cleveland staple; fresh corned beef and roasted turkey, salads and sides. I did the Greek salad and found it weird they didn't have a Greek style dressing. The Italian was good. I added shaved turkey and it was excellent. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Went here for a Sunday morning brunch. The food is great just wish it was a little more warmer by time I got the food back to my table. They do have enough options for the brunch for everyone and I like how they have fresh to order omelettes. They also have a bloody Mary bar if you like those with alot toppings u can choose from. Will go back for the corned beef sandwich. So good!"}
{"text":"After eating a corned beef from Slyman's, all other corned beef sandwiches i've ever had seem sad.

This meal was soooo good its almost hard to find words. Their regular corned beef sandwich is so large, it could honestly be two meals/split between two people. You cannot go wrong with the corned beef sandwich, which is super lean and juicy. Slyman's also has a super generous Yelp check-in offer. If you check-in on your Yelp app, you get a free order of Slyman's fries, which are basically a huge helping of delicious goodness. The gravy is an A+. Between the fries and the sandwich, a food coma is surely on your horizon. My mouth waters just thinking about it. 

Slyman's is decorated beautifully for the holidays, which naturally accents their stained glass-esque detailing. The inside is way more spacious then I anticipated, and the Tavern as a whole has 10+ TVs lining the walls. We counted. If you're dining here, its impossible to miss any game. The inside also has a huge bar area. If you come to eat (or drink), you won't have any problems finding a seat. We will definitely be back to Slyman's!"}
{"text":"First off, I can't fault this joint's food. It's pretty much the same thing you'd get downtown, along with newer editions of bar food that kids/picky people/hateful humans that don't like corned beef will accept. However, when my friends and I got there around noon on a Sunday, we were seated by a nice host and ... abandoned? Like, nobody came to our table for half an hour. There were definitely a fair amount of servers there, because every five minutes one would crane their neck around the corner and stare at our table for a few seconds. I dunno, maybe they were short-staffed? But when you (well, ME in this instance) have to walk up to the bar to simply request drinks at a fairly well-staffed family restaurant, you know things aren't running all that well.

Plus (and I hate to pile on), it was a fairly cold and rainy day. After a couple minutes of sitting at our table, cold water leaking through a spot on the roof hits my friend in the head. There was definitely a steady trickle going on. This is full-on \"You Have a Hole in Your Roof\" situation. Once we finally had a server, we mentioned this to her. She said, \"Oh yeah, we've had a lot of that lately. We've spent $40,000 on the roof so far. It's been happening all over the restaurant. Sorry.\" Um, yeah. I guess maybe go here when it's not raining out?

The whole thing was a shame, because of course the food is so (pause) damn (pause) good. Corned beef and pastrami until the end of days. I mean, who am I kidding? I'll probably be back. I've been thinking of that Reuben all week."}
{"text":"Of all the places I could have picked, I picked Slymans for my Birthday.  I was excited to be there and thus, the stated 30 minute wait time was not a problem.  After 30 minutes I went to see what was going on because there were several open tables, but no one was being seated.  Still 4-5 groups ahead of us, so I waited another 15 minutes.  After seeing no one being seated and ANOTHER  4-5 tables open up, I asked the hostess what was going on.  She said their systems were down and there was nothing they could do.  I asked if they couldn't just seat people manually.  After all, how hard is it to get someone seated and bring them water.  She said they couldn't do that and that there was nothing she could do.  She was rude and acted like she couldn't care less if we were there or not.  

I walked back to my party and someone else came out stating that they were just told the wait time was now 2 hours!!!  I walked back in to see if that was true and someone else who was waiting already had called for the manager.  I was interested to hear what he had to say.  After another 10 minutes the manager finally came over.  He was completely clueless.  By now, by one other patron's count, there were 24 OPEN TABLES.  The other party asked why they couldn't take orders on paper and at least get food to people.  The manager looked at us like we were from Mars and said there was nothing he could do.  Really?  You can't have your waiters take orders on paper like the old days?  Nothing you could do?  Not even seat your customers and bring water?

Here's my take.  First the hostess should have come out and informed everyone what was going on, rather than just be irritated that someone had the gall to ask her what the situation was.  The Manager should have actually MANAGED the situation and seated folks and run orders manually.  They must have lost $10K by leaving all those tables open with no one in them for 2 hours.

Needless to say, I left.  It will be a long time before I decide to try that location again. I know they are newly opened, but that staff and particularly the Manager need a LOT of training.  He was completely inadequate to the task and Slymans lost thousands of dollars due to his inaction."}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant, excellent service and the food is terrific. I would come back here in a minute. Carry on Slyman's!!"}
{"text":"This cannot be the same owners as downtown very greasy corned beef and dry bread will not come back"}
{"text":"Called in a take out order 30 minutes ahead and when I go to pick it up they don't have my order.   Manager did nothing to apologize or compensate for the error."}
{"text":"First time there. Been to downtown and Rockside many times. Not impressed with this location. Place was messy and floors were filthy. Bathroom worse. I counted at least 5 waitresses chatting at hostess stand when they could have been working to clean the place up. Open door to sloppy kitchen not a good look. Corned beef seemed fattier and more salty than other locations. I overheard a waitress tell another patron when asked about desert that she didn't know what was good because she never ate desert there then proceeded to read right  off the menu to the customer. Not good. Did not like the acoustics here either. Very loud. We'll drive the extra 20 minutes to Rockside  next time."}
{"text":"Asked for a Arnold Palmer and they ran out of lemonade. Could have given me lemons to squeeze on the side."}
{"text":"I have been to slymans downtown years ago and was quite satisfied. I took my girlfriend yesterday to the new one and let me tell you giant eagle sliced sandwich corned beef had better flavor. I got a Reuben and she got the fish dinner. 15 bucks for a pile of flavorless meat and a pickle. The sauerkraut was a very thin layer and had a zero on the flavor scale. Her fish was a large portion but it was oily and greasy. I don't think the fryer temp was right and the fish got saturated. The breading was very flavorless as well. 

Can't complain about the service or atmosphere that was fine. Just very unhappy. I've heard that mr slymans said he doesn't want to start a chain because the quality will be lost.... He was right. 

If anyone takes this post to heart... Don't waste your time going there."}
{"text":"I love Corned Beef.  I love Pastrami.  Did I mention I love Corned Beef.

In the Independence area this is THE best place to grab a sandwich.  The make a nice authentic product in a casual bar setting.  Really nice when the weather allows them to open the doors and windows.

The sandwich is top notch!  Get the full sized and you will have a food coma, but it is fun to munch your way through.  Both the hot Pastrami and Corned Beef are great.  The Pastrami really does set itself apart here.

They also make a nice selection of soups and a to go order is ready when you need it.

Love this for lunch."}
{"text":"Place looks great. Hostesses were very friendly and the wait staff was great. That being said...my dinner tasted like nothing. Even with salt and pepper it was blah. The manager offered to switch it out for something else but at that point in my night I just wanted to leave. Ee had to wait a little longer than normal for our meal but tbey were busy so....No hot beef dinner from the hearty portion section ever again.  I'm sure the Reuben or corned beef will be fine. May or may not be back."}

Onion rings are not bad, but become very good in the sauce provided. Like the atmosphere, including wall to wall TV's. Nice beer selection. Waitress was very friendly."}
{"text":"yes, yes, yes. I've never been to the original Slymans downtown, but this location is so fabulous. Our server was so attentive. What can be said About their food that hasn't been said before? Anyone from cleveland knows how freaking good this place is. Try the slymans fries - they don't disappoint!"}
{"text":"My 82 year-old uncle and I came for the corned beef , about which we've heard very good things . We arrived at 130 pm . The hostess refused to seat us at a four top , as those were \"only available for four people \". This made little sense in light of the facts that a) no-one was waiting, b) it was beyond the lunch hour, c) there were plenty of empty four tops , d) most of the occupied four tops had only two patrons , and e) we were polite . Unsure if this is a reflection of one individual who should not be in the business of providing hospitality or of the way the restaurant is run in general . Either way , I didn't see the logic behind asking my uncle to perch at a high top table when more comfortable seating was readily available. The waitress (Octavia) was, in contrast , sweet , polite , and helpful ."}
{"text":"None of the character and originality of the Cleveland staple, this one is in a strip mall on Rockside Road so it totally lacks a cool factor in the way that a chain usually does. But they are serving the same delicious corned beef on rye, so this is a solid choice. A Reuben sandwich is always a solid choice.  I do love the indoor/ outdoor vibe which does give this an advantage over the other restaurants in the area. Melt did this better, copied the charm of their original to a copycat strip location and when in the area and looking for a sandwich they would still be my first choice BUT if it was a warm sunny day, I'd be at Slyman's outside patio seating."}
{"text":"I love a great Slyman's corned beef sandwich as I have been going to the downtown location for years. When I heard another one was opening up I knew I had to check it out.

First the positives. This location is pretty big with a sports bar feeling.  Lots of TVs near the bar so you can watch the games or news.  Happy hour drink specials.  More things to choose from on the menu including appetizers and non sandwich type items like salads, pierogi and fish.  There is something on the menu for everyone's tastes.

What I didn't like. The tables are way too close!  Every time a customer or server would walk by our chairs would get bumped and our jackets would nearly get knocked on the floor.  This place is big so no need to cram the tables in.  One other concern.  My corned beef sandwich has not been consistent from order to order. First visit it was pretty good.  Another time I got a big chunk of unchew-able fat in the middle of my sandwich.

There are somethings that can be improved. Not quite like the quality of the St. Clair location however I'm appreciative that we can get legendary Slyman's in the suburbs.  I want to support a good thing so I will be back."}
{"text":"Not the downtown location, but very good! I enjoyed it being more of a sit down spot. The food was on par with the original (aka HHUUUGGGE) and my server was kind. With a yelp check in we even got Slyman Fries for free! Unfortunately, the closest location to me has really bad reviews, but this location exceeded expectations!"}
{"text":"Just checked it out and we were pleasantly
surprised!  Hubby had the original
corned beef and I had the Reuben.  Both were as good (and as large) as downtown
Service could not have been better!  The kitchen manager, Greg, stopped by our table    during our meal.  Upon arrival I commented
that out of all the TVs not one had a Stanley Cup Playoff game on. They asked which
game we wanted to watch and before we got our drinks, the TV in nearest proximity had the hockey game on.  We'll be back."}
{"text":"I came home to visit Cleveland this weekend and was told this place opened up about 15 minutes away from my mother's house. Like other reviewers said, it doesn't taste like the original but it is still good. I only deducted a star because of the portions versus the price."}
{"text":"We love Slyman's Tavern. Best Corned Beef in town. They do have a happy hour from 3:00 - 6:00, Monday thru Friday. It has $1.00 off all drinks, beer and wine by the glass and selected $5.00 appetizers. They also have a late night happy hour 9:00 till close. 

Prices seem high at first, $13.99 for a corned beef sandwich but when you look at the size and quality of what you get, it seems justified. If you don't feel like one of their famous sandwiches they also offer a lighter side menu. What I love is the \"Sides and Add On\" Menu.  I love, love, love their Potato Pancakes. Yummmmmm! 

What is fun is the inside/outside atmosphere at the bar. The walls and ceiling slides open and you are now sitting outside while actually being inside. Nothing like sitting at the bar with a glass of wine or a cold beer surrounded by sunshine and a warm summer breeze. On cooler nights they also have a fireplace outside.  Really....Cool! 

They are always busy so sometimes if you want a table you have to wait, but we always sit at the bar so getting seated is never a problem. The wait staff is very helpful. I have seen a few of the girls go out of their way to accommodate customers. I don't find the male bartenders as accommodating but they still do a good job. 

All in all we will return when we crave good corned beef and mom's Potato Pancakes. It won't be a nightly haunt because of the price, but it is worth a bimonthly visit."}
{"text":"Finally got to try Slymans Tavern! Of course when anyone has out of towners come in, you should always take them out for a some quality corned beef sandwich.  The ambiance is definitely nice and comical since they have the three stooges theme going on.  There is a great and big selection of beer!! I ordered the corned beef Reuben which was large in size but not as large as the downtown slymans.

They just recently opened this week so I know it will take some time for them to get used to the new equipment they have here, so people should give them time to adjust.  Just like any restaurant the first weeks are always inconsistent with the quality and taste of the food.  The texture of the sandwich was good but the meat was a bit dry.  Their french fries was ordered separately and was delicious as well.. the best part was that they were crinkled cut fries!!!

Overall I would give them a 4 star rating because the service was amazing and the food and drinks were good!! I'm sure once they get used to the new equipment that their corned beef would be AMAZING!!!  Definitely will come back to give them a try again!"}
{"text":"Killer corned beef! Great beverage selection. A place that truly celebrates Cleveland."}
{"text":"Very disorganized.  We saw several open tables both inside and outside, hostess argued with each other about seating us right away or not and we were then told we had to wait for 20 minutes. We left.  It was clear they do not care about the customer."}
{"text":"Jewish Deli with a sports bar vibe; more a Jewish deli. Had the corned beef melt and potato cakes. Corned beef is a solid B. Potato cakes were poor - basically a spicier version of what you get at Arby's. Saw the previous reviews on the bartender and if it's the same one (proud of her ink) she wasn't that bad. Not going to win Miss Congeniality but pretty attentive and that's what I look for."}
{"text":"This is a sad day for me. Slymans has officially declined to the point I can no longer look the other way and wait in vain for them to restore the glory days of bein the premier spot for corned beef. It's been a steady decline and tnite was the straw that broke the camels back. Corned beef Reuben was cold as it's been last few times. Rye bread was soggy, flimsy and cold w the cheese hardened to it as if it had been sittin Under a heat lamp for hours. I sent it back as did my uncle as his was the same. Came back out exactly as it went back in. I was astonished. Cold, ultra dry corned beef, soggy, Luke warm flimsy bread cheese hardened to it. Not to mention no matter how many times I tell them let me finish my salad before you bring out my dinner, they always come out on top of each other. I've tried to just order a salad and when I'm done w it then I order a Reuben to no avail. It's consistently dry and cold w flimsy soggy bread. The ore ida fries are always horrific but easily overlooked w a great corned beef sandwich. Now they stick out like a sore thumb. When your paying $17 for a Reuben w no sides it better be great. It used to be. Now it's not. Very sad. We won't be going back"}
{"text":"Well the food is good but pricey! The service is sad.  The service is much better at the old Slyman's.  They take your order and confirm it.  I am sitting here right now after ordering food from Denise. I ordered a drink and wanted to order another. I been sitting here 30 min   Waiting until the guy next to me asked me what I wanted and bought it for me. She tried to give me back my .50 from a miss order. I feel insulted. I also asked for a side the menu said was .50 and she billed me $2.99.  I hope this changes because that is just not cool."}
{"text":"Horrible, horrible, Horrible!  I've been downtown and Independence, both were amazing!  Beachwood was terrible.  Went last Saturday around 1:30 PM so it was not so busy.  I sat at the bar where there was 1 person helping everyone.  I waited 10 minutes for water and a menu.  I finally ordered the grilled salami sandwich and fries.  The waitress came back 4 times to ask me questions. Large or small, there was only 1 size.  What kind of bread, it was served on rye.  How did i want the egg?, says comes with a fried egg. I waited 50 more minutes for my food.  It finally came out.  The egg on my sandwich was clear, not cooked at all.....fries ice cold.  I went to chick fill a.  I tried to call and speak with someone, the independence store answered and said Beachwood was not taking calls????  Their not cooking any food, so why not at least answer the phone!"}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place. I knew going in that this wasn't the Slyman's downtown after I read an article that said Slyman's sold their name for franchise purposes. We ordered corned beef and roast beef brisket sandwiches and traded halves to taste. Both were dry beyond belief. I could not swallow the corned beef, and the roast beef couldn't be dryer or had any less flavor. Very disappointed. And just because I'm a masochist, we ordered a slice of cheesecake, because come on, every deli has good cheesecake. Nope. This was as dry as the sandwiches were despite having a flavorless raspberry topping.  Anyway, received our check only to find a promotion card to get on the email list for the Tilted Kilt. Had I known there was any affiliation, I never would have stopped at Slyman's. So did the Tilted Kilt buy the Slyman's franchise so they could open a place in the 'burbs? That's my guess. We paid too much for so little."}
{"text":"No one was happier than me to hear that Slyman's, that Corned Beef Nirvana, was opening on the east side. I had waited several months from its opening to allow it to go through the opening shakedown. Turns out I should have waited longer. 

We were greeted politely, seated promptly and our order was taken quickly. The starter, Italian wedding soup as the soup du jour, arrived at room temperature and was sent back, returning only slightly warmer. 

My \"small\" corned beef showed up quickly too, but it was clear that the bread had been sitting out (the \"outside\" of the rye was dry while the side facing the beef was not), as was the corned beef. It wasn't warm and it lacked the silky texture that was standard at the downtown location. A nice sized portion but the corned beef was dry and unappetizing. I ended up alternating bites of the sandwich with bites of the pickle, and the pickle won every time. By the way, extra pickles are 50 cents each.

We finished up with a piece of the chocolate fondant. A beautiful piece of cake. If we had been food photographers, we would have been in heaven because it looked far better than it tasted. Like the rye bread, the fondant was dry and lacked flavor. To our server's credit, when he noticed that each of us had taken one forkful and then pushed it aside, he removed it from the table and the bill.

It is perfectly possible that my experience was a one-off and that Slyman's will redeem itself when I go back to try the pastrami. So I'm not writing it off, especially because it is a terrific space with a variety of seating options and a toasty fireplace. But if I have to go downtown to get Slyman's signature corned beef, I'll be happy to take the drive."}
{"text":"Slyman's is a Cleveland Institution and they have opened a mix here.  The corned beef is really tasty and the portion size is huge.  I like the bread here too and the service was acceptable.

They have a good size bar and even the opportunity to sit outside with the bar in the corner of the building-- really nice design.  But it isn't the original and is trying to do so much here---pleasing all is not that simple.  I was disappointed the Stadium Mustard came in a little cup portion and not in a bottle which can be applied to the sandwich.

I am with those who share the sandwich and yes, if they were less busy, I probably would have liked it more.... but they are trying to be Slyman's with a sports BAR--- and for today I was looking for lunch and it was fine--not as special as the original."}
{"text":"Having been a fan of the original Syman's I can only say.... why would the family allow this franchise to use the name!  First I was greeted by a surly women who told me I was at the pickup counter and that I need to go to the front entrance in order to get a seat!  The front entrance turns out to be on the side of the building. She could have at least been a bit more cordial and accomadating, as there were only a few people in the restaurant. 

Next came my choice, corned beef and hash, eggs and toast.at &12.99!  The hash constsisted mostly of potatoes with very little evidence of corned beef. 12.99 is a high price for eggs and potatoes. The Slyman family is having their ne ruined by this place. I live not far from here but given the value/cost there are simply too many choices to come back here again"}
{"text":"Always has been and always will be the biggest and tastiest corned beef sandwich in the world."}
{"text":"The reason why I'm giving this a two star and not a one is because I didn't even get to taste the food. So I'm on my way to Bahama Breeze my husband and I decided hey let's try this new restaurant. We arrived at 10:30 and we was greeted by a girl that told us the kitchen close in 10 min and do we still want to sit down. Poor customer service.. she lied because my husband called to see if the kitchen was still open and the guy said yes and it was 20 min later. We left and went to one of our favorite places, where we was greeted with open arms. I love Bahama Breeze. If you want great food and superior customer service go there."}
{"text":"Best corned beef in the area by far! The bar is also very chill, large draft beer selection and an open patio area for nice days. The free slymans fries with yelp check in are delicious!!!"}
{"text":"Do better! I wait almost 30 minutes for a bacon and egg sandwich one morning and let me say I was the first and only person in the place. Made me late for work. And then one night I called to place an order and the young lady kept giving me my total before I could finish my order. I had to say I'm not finish twice. Annoyed! THEN the corn beef was a tad dry. Beautiful decor. Can't wait to hang out at the bar this summer."}
{"text":"This is definitely not the same as the original Slyman's location.  The service was okay.  Not great, not bad, just mediocre.  Stick to the Slyman's classics if you are ordering food (e.g., Pastrami, Corned Beef, Reuben, etc).  We ventured to try a BLT, hotdog, and the tavern fries.  Although the food arrived quickly, all three were undercooked and soggy.  Blythe beer selection was decent.  Thank goodness."}
{"text":"Service was great!  Kristen was attentive and always had a smile on her face. 
I got the Turkey sandwich. It was just ok. Portion was enormous but it was very plain. Just turkey on bread. I wouldn't get it again. 
I also ordered the Slyman fries. Very tasty and would definitely get an order for the table."}
{"text":"I love the downtown location and the simplicity this is just them trying too hard to make multiple Concepts work in one restaurant seems like they're confused between sports bar and deli restaurant. Food was okay had breakfast there twice neither time was spectacular service was very poor both times won't be returning."}
{"text":"Great service, great food, good prices. Even tho we sat at the bar, we got privacy and prompt attention - thanks, we'll be back"}
{"text":"Service was slow and corned beef was cold. The 50-cent extra for Swiss cheese was lame. I found our waitress and the waiter at the next table patronizing and putting on an act."}
{"text":"Excited to see a Slymans open on the east side. We got there about 7:30 tonight, on a Thursday, to get some great corned beef. Walked in very pleasantly surprised to see a TON of open tables. When we went to the hostess we were told 45 minutes...\"is that okay?\" No it's not okay, you have 50 open tables in the inside and out on the patio and we're asked if it's okay if they keep us waiting 45 minutes for a sandwich. Unfortunately this burned us and we walked out, drove 5 minutes up the road to Corky and Lenny's where they were very happy to accommodate our table of 2. Sorry Slymans, if you do t have enough staff to get off the ground, don't open. We'd rather wait for an establishment to establish than drive 35 minutes and be asked to wait another 45 because they were ill prepared."}
{"text":"Went here after flying in.  Was greeted and seated quickly.  The waitress was very friendly and informative on the menu.  I had the light Rueben and fries.  Light meaning smaller portion of meat.  The food came out quickly but unfortunately the fries were not very hot or crispy.  Also had a beer.  With tip the meal was about $24.  I would recommend going here."}
{"text":"As an outpost, the Tavern doesn't have the character of the original Slyman's and instead feels more like a standard chain restaurant.  That said, the Slyman's meats are still incredible here, as is the flavorful bread.  I was underwhelmed by the sides in comparison, though, feeling that they fell a little flat. The menu is good-sized; it includes a few non-meat options and a few non-deli-meat options . . . but I haven't tried anything in those categories because Slyman's corned beef and pastrami are outstanding.  There's also a large menu of beers, cocktails, and liquors.

The nice, bright restaurant and bar has plenty of seating indoors, plus a few seats on the small outdoor patio in front of a fireplace.  There are high ceilings and numerous tvs throughout.  The bar is large, with bubbling, color-lit tubes that give it a bit of a modern, mad-scientist vibe that I thought was cool.  The staff was friendly and knowledgeable."}
{"text":"Slymans on St Clair has always been my favorite place in Cleveland for corned beef.  I was really happy to see them open up a second location in independence and I wasn't disappointed.  We ate on the patio which was really fun, great atmosphere and the beer was frosty and ice cold.  The corned beef, extra lean was tasty as always. We ordered potato cakes which were flavorful even if a bit on the greasy side.  Beer and corned beef, rocking combo!"}
{"text":"This place is nothing like the Original, nothing. The atmosphere is completely different but very nice. I really like the setup and how it is arranged as they upgraded everything.

The tavern has taken on the personality of its neighborhood, mush as the original has done in its locale ......

The food??

Just a shade below the Original, just a tad drier and the sandwiches are just a little smaller. 
My profile picture is the size of a corned beef sandwich from the Original in the hand of a 6'7 man ....... the tavern sandwich is not as large.  

It's still good ... better than most ...... the Original is still the standard bearer.

This is a nice place..GO!!!"}
{"text":"I've been supporting Slymans for years. I grew up eat slymans, every time my family comes into town we make sure to swing by and get our fix. Today I was told that a tavern opened up so we went. It took an hour plus to get our food and it wasn't until I had to ask for a manger to see what was going on before they checked. Then they through our food together and rushed it out to us and had they orders wrongs. On top of that a big argument shouting match breaks out in the kitchen between employees. Last the manger didn't even come back out to speak with me to address any issues. Slymans may want to rethink this venture as a restaurant owner and operator this will kill the name they have build over the years."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Reuben Sandwiches. In fact my fiance and I both do and Slyman's have THE BEST. They are huge and they do not skimp on the meat. We went to grab some food after our two hour workout at Lifetime Fitness down the street from Slyman's lastnight. Wow...it hit the spot. I was starving. The fries are crispy and not soft. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Enjoy the corn beef so much.  I wish I did not get the lunch portion.  I thought it was small for the price.  Stick with the regular and you will be happy."}
{"text":"Breakfast on a Sunday.  First thought it will be busy, not so here at 10:09 arrival. Seated and given drinks and ordered in a timely fashion.  That's where it ended.  Coffee refills sloooooowwwww. Be careful though, strong coffee and you are slotted two creamers per cup.  Same with butter...allotted one butter pack for two slices of rye.  Oy.  Anyway, we finally received our lukewarm food at 10:58. Food not bad, better if hot probably. Not worth the wait.  Goodness knows how it would be busy.  They don't have breakfast buffet yet. That may be a good thing to come for the servers, to only have to worry about drinks orders.  Hope it gets better."}
{"text":"Hanging out with old friends, catching up. Thomas is our server. He is very attentive without hovering. Very polite and had a lot of great suggestions as this is our first time here. Food is delicious and served hot. Extensive beer menu."}
{"text":"So I'm not a corned beef fan, terrible for a Clevelander (I know), but I recently went to Slyman's and got an egg salad sandwich and must say it was pretty good. I ordered pasta salad, which was better on my first visit, so I asked for something different and was given potato salad, which was just okay too. However, the egg salad was really good and huge as you can imagine based on the size of their other sandwiches. The place also has a cool vibe and is open for lunch which is awesome! I love eating local and am happy to have another local place."}
{"text":"Wanted to check this place out but wanted the crowd to die down first.
This day the place was packed and the food was not very good. I think the other location has a better presentation and the food taste better."}
{"text":"Corned beef was great. Piled high  but we noticed the bread was smaller so it was not as big of a sandwich as the one downtown. I will try it again hopefully they have bigger bread next time so we get a decent size sandwich"}
{"text":"Food was ok but the service and the wait time was terrible. What corned beef restaurant runs out of corned beef? That's like McDonalds running out hamburger....Crazy! They also forgot lettuce, tomato, and onion on a sandwich that advertised that was the way it came. Probably won't be going back. Other bad reviews are understood after my visit."}
{"text":"It was my first time dining here, as I am not from the area. The waitress was very kind and and gave me recommendations, of which I ordered the corned beef Reuben. It was fantastic, and boy, are their portions generous! Had a good selection of beer and drinks to choose from as well. Will definitely be coming back if I find myself nearby again."}
{"text":"I've been waiting to go and finally got a chance.  
The Cleveland location is still without a doubt the best.  

Corned beef was dry, portion size smaller (I got the large), flavors were just not there.  

I had high hopes...   I guess I'll still go to Cleveland.

I hope the tavern turns things around or you won't make it. I'm going to wait until fall and try again."}
{"text":"Now I have been to this place for both brunch and dinner, I can give it a proper review! Dinner was great! I was worried we would have to wait but the place is huge inside and the service was ON POINT. I had a huge salad with pastrami on top while my husband got the roast beef. Both were delicious. I know what you are thinking- why didn't we get corned beef? Well I have already been to the downtown location on several occasions for lunch and I've had the corned beef many times!

I don't have as much of a rave review for brunch. Their corned beef hash was almost all potatoes and not a lot of corned beef. My friends corned beef eggs Benedict however,looked phenomenal! They do offer a brunch buffet which is nice and a bloody mad bar. They also offer bottomless mimosas for 9.99 which we were excited about at first until we realized they were all orange juice and almost no champagne. They are probably making a killing on those. Even when I asked for less orange juice she came back and advised that she put a bit of triple sec into it which isn't what I asked for.

Either way, dinner was great and I would definitely come back. Brunch wasn't bad but I'll stick with Bloody Marys."}
{"text":"Went for supper on a gorgeous sunny day and with 7 open tables outside was told it would be 35 minutes to seat us there but we could wait at the bar.  I think they were short servers because we sat, crabbed on the corner of the outside bar, for 1 hour and the outside tables were never filled.  What is the difference between waiting at the bar vs waiting at a table we liked, in the sun, enjoying a drink?
Ordered food at the bar with our drinks (gave up on an outside table).  Ordered house salad and the \"light\" corned beef sandwich.  Salad came after the sandwich by 5 minutes and without dressing!  Sandwich was plain -- no condiments!  Dry as a bone.
Bartender tried to comp by offering a free glass of wine.
Won't go back there."}
{"text":"This is the famous Slman's so expectations are set hi.  Unfortunately waiting 25 minutes for your beverage to show up should not be anyone's standard.  People that came in after us well after was served before we got ours. I know it sounds petty but,,,,,  the problem according to staff was the bottle beer I ordered was not in their pos so they didn't know what to do.  How about serve the customer then have management figure it out.  The staff seemed confused on other issues such as brining out the appetizers at the same time as the entrée.  Then a few minutes later another round of appetizers shows up.  Seemed disorganized.  Now to the food. I and the wife got the corn beef sandwich which we thought was a bit greasy the appetizers all of them was average.  Overall I hope it is because it just opened and will get better. We might go back in a few months to see but this dinning experience took us 2 hours and 47 minutes so plan accordingly."}
{"text":"I went to the new location of Slymans in Beachwood. I got the smaller version of the corned beef sandwich and I still only ate half. I also got a side order of potato pancakes which seem to be possibly frozen and deep-fried. Definitely not a handmade pancake. I saved the other half of the sandwich thinking I would eat it later and it ended up going bad in my fridge. Haven't been back since even though I drive by it all the time hungry."}
{"text":"We ordered two pastrami sandwiches, a Reuben & a corn beef - all were the light sandwich option.  Not happy with the corn beef and the Ryebread was way too airy & tasteless to hold up to the likes of a mountain of corn beef or pastrami.  Pastrami was better than the corn beef, but it too was lacking & again desperately needs a better, hardier, chewy rye as that bread is pretty dismal. Having grown up on the East Coast I have a high standard for what makes a good pastrami or corn beef and this is not it.  But even their fries and onion rings were below average. And for some unknown reason they're Yeungling shandy with half grapefruit juice costs more than the same sized Yeungling?  Maybe because it was opening week or maybe because they think we can't tell a good deli sandwiches from a mediocre one, but whatever the reason, this was a big disappointment from the famous Slyman's.  With 2 beers the tab topped $70, so no bargain either."}
{"text":"The portions are huge. Busy sports bar atmosphere and the food was so good. We loved the loaded potato latkes, pierogis, and sauerkraut balls. The sandwiches were huge and delicious. Would definitely come back! Great service also!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I had lunch here over the weekend, and it was okay. I agree with the other Yelpers - the sandwiches seem smaller and (sorry), the meat much drier and less melt-in-your-mouth delicious, than the downtown location. 

I'm not sure, but I also think it's more expensive at $15 for a reuben. The fact that the sandwiches are smaller than the original should not be a deterrent - they are still near impossible to eat in one sitting! 

That being said, the space is beautiful. Unlike the divey charm of the downtown location, the tavern is all sleek leather and hardwood floors and a fun pop culture mural printed on canvas. Our server was super friendly and attentive despite the place being really crowded. 

I feel like they might be financing the cost of their beautiful new digs with more expensive food (and, smaller portions) $8.50 for a Morningstar burger and no fries? That is shameful and insane.

I always hate to sound like a cheapskate, but... at the price of a sandwich and fries, you can have an awesome entrée at Lockkeepers or L'Albatros - I mention those places specifically because those are my go-to \"special occasion\" places that are infrequent because of cost... I see Slymans succeeding more as a casual, quick, inexpensive dinner or lunch.... only, it's not cheap. 

I am definitely rooting for this place, but... I can't say I'd go out of my way any time soon to return."}
{"text":"Met up with a friend here while in town and was recommended the corned beef sandwich. It was phenomenal. It sounds like this is the go to sandwich at this bar. For the price and amount of food you get, it is worth checking out. 

I wasn't super impressed with the service. The bartender almost looked annoyed we sat down. She came around and introduced herself after about 10 minutes, but seemed overwhelmed behind the bar. Nonetheless, after she took our drink order, she seemed to warm up a bit, but not the most friendly service. 

I wouldn't mind coming back if in town again."}
{"text":"One of the most iconic food stops in Cleveland is Slyman's Restaurant. Serving up the best corned beef in town (and IMHO, anywhere) for years and years- it's an essential taste of the Cleveland landscape. 

Slyman's Tavern had a lot of pressure to be just as great and I say, with a mouthful of soft pretzels, they certainly are great.
My first stop to SLyman's Tavern was a few years ago and for BREAKFAST instead of a corned beef sandwich. I was wowed from the start. The breakfast buffet was awesome. So much variety and delicious, well-prepared food to choose from.
The mark of a good breakfast spot for me is a tasty Bloody Mary. Slyman's has an impressive bloody mary bar with all the fixins you can imagine and even some you can't! The mix was perfect and really made my Sunday.

My most recent experience was just as satisfying. A friend and I shared some appetizers and even though I ordered the Lite-size Reuben, there was still a half of a sandwich left to take home. Flavorful corned beef, non-soggy fresh bread and a tangy kraut. We shared some fried pickles, a soft pretzel and Slyman's fries. (Her hubby was the beneficiary of our leftovers)  It's not cheap eats, but it is good eats. The restaurant itself is clean, decorated in a fun way and service is usually friendly and prompt.

The location is probably a huge asset for them as well. Right off 77, near 480, on Rockside Rd in a plaza with plenty of parking- there's no excuse for you to not be eating here!"}
{"text":"I thought everything was great. The service and all the food. Not sure why people gave bad reviews. I am very picky when it comes to restaurants. But I could not find any flaws. Great big sandwiches and great service. Place was very busy. I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"I have to give the corned beef 5 stars - it is always good, it is seasoned properly and is not fatty. I can make a sandwich and a half out of the amount of meat they serve. Also the pickle has a lot of flavor. 
I DO AGREE with \"Bill A.\" about the fries, I only ordered them once and will never order those again. As \"Bill A.\" said they are flavorless. I don't understand why slyman's can't figure out how to make fresh-cut fries. If they need to find out how, they could learn from the 5 guys restaurant."}
{"text":"Amazing Customer Service and delicious food! Our waitress was quick, but not impatient. Very friendly, the restaurant was clean and everything looked delicious"}
{"text":"Went here near closing time on a weekday. Good atmosphere. Waitress whipped up some honey nut Cheerio shots to start the evening, and then I went on to order a famous slyman's corned beef sandwich, and wifey got the philly steak.

The corned beef was great, but I still need to do a side by side, bite by bite with Cleveland Corned beef co. because from my recollection CCBC still seems better. 

I think it may be too thinly sliced although that certainly makes for a easier to chew meat.

We will still need to go to the downtown Cleveland location for a truly authentic slyman's experience."}
{"text":"Slymans Corned Beef has changed since this place opened. I think they are using a different quality brisket. Anyways it's a decent deli with decent overpriced foods ."}
{"text":"I think most Clevelanders have tried or at least heard of Slymans, however this was my first time going to the bar/restaurant on Rockside Rd in Independence and I loved it. It was a cool fall night and this place was so cozy it was great! The décor is very interesting and pays homage to the year 1964. I found myself constantly finding new things to check out and read on the walls. There were several games on and I was kind of surprised at how great it was watching them at Slymans. And of course the food was sensational. I'll absolutely be back soon!"}
{"text":"This is the real deal!!!  The corned beef sandwich is the best you will ever eat and is well worth the price.  Also, the bar has a good vibe and has a pretty decent happy hour as well during the week!  Definitely a Cleveland staple!"}
{"text":"I love corned beef sandwiches and reubens.  If that's your jam this is your place.  They are obviously known for their monstrosity of a meat pile.  The original I have never been and I'm pretty sure it is a totally different experience.  I like independence because it's close to home and their is a full bar.  Parking can be a bit of a challenge because it's a larger plaza.  Food is good, fast, and friendly service.  Don't be intimidated by the meat pile, you can get a smaller size."}
{"text":"A nice edition to an area that already has a bunch of dining out options (and about to get a lot more w. the addition of Pinecrest and whatever is going in across the street from it).  Everyone has heard of Slyman's near downtown w. their legendary corned beef sandwiches.  And this spot offers that as well, but additionally offers normal size sandwiches as well.  Other good options are the various fried specialties including sauerkraut balls and fried pickles and onion rings.  I said good, not good for you.   They also offer various other meat sandwiches and melts, and a solid breakfast menu.  Pretty much anything can be served with \"cheese and corn beef sprinkled on it\".  One complaint, no wifi.  Tough to have a business lunch there because of that.  A bit pricey, but always packed, Slyman's will deliver a good meal whether its breakfast, lunch, or dinner."}
{"text":"I had the corn beef hash. It was OK. I had higher expectations due to the place being known for their meat. It was a little bland and not as flavorful as other hashes I've had. 

But, on a positive note, they had a good selection of beerand appetizers which I enjoyed."}
{"text":"Slymans  has been one of our families favorite restaurants. They have amazing food but their service has gone down as far as customer service. They messed up my order didn't correct it and then said they put my name in their register book to claim my free sandwich as a correction called today and the other manager had no record of my name very unprofessional to lie to a customer I will never eat at this location again because of this bad experience."}
{"text":"My review is based only on their brunch buffet and my experience with their staff. I went there with a group of friends and we almost all got the brunch buffet. It consisted of scrambled eggs (2 kinds), bacon, sausage, frozen French toast sticks, pancakes, fruit and an omelette station. That's actually not much, was only so-so in taste, and they stopped restocking it at noon even though the buffet goes until 1. They advertise the bellinis are bottomless, but they're not, which they don't tell you until you order a second. The omelette station was also out of toppings.  The manager was both rude and unaccommodating to our larger group, even though I'd called twice in advance to make sure there would be a table for us available. Our server was also unfriendly. I don't think any of us would return for brunch again."}
{"text":"I have nothing but positivity towards this place. The food, the atmosphere, and the staff are all top notch.

I'm a big corned beef fan, and this is by far the best corned beef sandwich I've ever had. Sliced thin and piled high, exactly the way I like it. It's seriously amazing, the best in Cleveland. Heck, it's the only place you should go for corned beef. 

The staff is wonderful, everyone has a smile, everyone. It's a nice touch. 

The restaurant is decorated quite nicely, It doesn't feel crammed even though the place is always slammed. It's busy, but comfortable. 

I've seen several complaints down below of people commenting on the price, what they fail to recognize is that GOOD corned beef does not come cheap, it is a little expensive, but Slyman's corned beef sandwiches are the epitome of \"you get what you paid for.\" 

I love this place, I hope they do well."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I took her cousin here for a night out a couple days  ago.  Weve been to Independence a few happy times but this Beachwood location.....I just say, WOW! Not in a good way.  Sat at the bar, as we always do in independence. ( the independence) bartenders are great! Not to mention, easy on the eyes...We waited a solid 5 minutes before putting in our drink order then waited without menus for another 10 minutes for our DRAFT BEERS.  Received apps quickly, the fried pickles and krout balls were good , but the corned beef sandwiches came out incorrectly.  We all ordered regular (big) sizes, yet we recieved lites.  Didnt get our fries, or the waters we requested, and didnt receive our beer refills untill after we ate.  We laughed as we all noticed one of the barmaids bent over grabbing a bite to eat in a take out box.  At least someone there was getting fed.  From the looks of it, she doesnt seem like one to ever miss a meal.  This is poor management....See you in independence."}
{"text":"It was my birthday. I don't go over board. Decided to get the small version corn beef sandwich to go. Sandwich was very very dry.
Why wouldn't mustard be on my sandwich, when I asked for it, especially a to go order; and I wasn't given mustard packs. My wife ordered a turkey sandwich and asked for mayo on the sandwich, no mayo on the sandwich, but mayo packs in the bag."}
{"text":"Friendly staff. Delicious corned beef. The Slyman fries hit the spot. Nice atmosphere and decor."}
{"text":"Slyman's is on St. Clair Ave (great) and another on Rockside Rd. They're owned by the same people (must have been on drugs when they opened Rockside) they're not even remotely similar. Let me put it this way. They're light years apart! We had two corned beef sandwiches two drinks each and an order of loaded fries $71 bucks (without tip) and it sucked! 

They have a mural of the 3 Stooges on the wall. Can't help feeling I was the 4th.

Never... repeat NEVER... again."}
{"text":"I went to Slyman's for breakfast this morning. I ordered the corned-beef hash meal. The staff was friendly and helpful. However, the eggs had no flavor, yuck. Neither did the potatoes. The worst thing is Slyman's is supposed to be famous for their corned-beef but where was it. I paid $13 for a bunch of potatoes and about 5 droplets of corned-beef. It was the worst $13 I have spent this year. Needless to say I will never go back there again. I've tasted better dirt. I feel robbed. If you're going for a beautiful place with warm ambiance then you may love it but if you're looking for food with real flavor and actual meat go somewhere else. You're only paying for the city in which they're serving you."}
{"text":"I have never. ever. seen a sandwich this big. You think I'm kidding? Come see it for yourself.

They have other things to eat besides their gargantuan sandwiches, but honestly, why would you eat anything else? They are best known for their reubens, which is what I had and would highly recommend. It's literally enough food for two meals (or two people) and is 90% meat. You can also order sandwiches with a \"shot\" of turkey or other meats. 

Everything is really flavorful! Our waitress was very nice and helpful. The food came out really quickly as well. I was impressed! I have never seen a sandwich this big anywhere else, it is something to experience!"}
{"text":"Slyman's is already established as a great place to come eat loads of meat, watch every game imaginable, and enjoy a beer. As other reviewers have mentioned, the corned beef is excellent, the portions are very generous, and the location is great. It definitely deserves its stars. My husband had already been here many times before he finally convinced me to come try it out, and he was elated when I finally said yes. We visited on a Sunday evening, and while they were fairly busy, we were seated immediately, the service was super fast, and we had a good experience overall. 

We started our meal off with the fried pickles which came with a cayenne ranch, and those were pretty good! (Although, it's hard to mess up fried pickles, lol.) My husband ordered the corned beef with swiss, and I ordered the corned beef reuben. We also split the Slyman's fries that we got for free by checking in on Yelp. My husband loved his sandwich, and while mine was good, unfortunately it was kind of forgettable. I've had many reubens in my life better than this one. It wasn't bad at all, but it just wasn't \"great.\" The ratio of corned beef to toppings is far too imbalanced, and I couldn't taste any cheese, sauerkraut, or thousand island. It was basically just like eating a corned beef sandwich, which was fine, and I still mostly enjoyed. I also hate to say it, but.... I didn't love the Slyman's fries. I see people raving about them, but to me they tasted really bland and needed a ton of salt. Obviously I didn't feel good about dumping salt on fries already covered with corned beef and cheese, but it desperately needed it. 

I think one visit was enough for me. I wanted to love this place, but it just didn't happen. I think 4 stars is a good and fair review though, and I still recommend checking it out if you're in the area. Even though I didn't love it, I can see why people do! And I know my husband will still continue to enjoy Slyman's with his co-workers and friends."}
{"text":"This place is known for its corned beef, which as the picture of my sandwich can attest, is piled high. Unfortunately, it was also piled dry. I would rather have a smaller, juicer, sandwich from Corky and Lenny's. Don't get me wrong, it's a decent sandwich, but I have had better in CLE."}
{"text":"Stumbled across this place while traveling on business in the Cleveland area. Ordered take out as the place was jammed packed. The pastrami was not NYC but very good. They forgot to put my drink in the bag so that was a bummer. But other than that I'd go back again with others to enjoy the liveliness of this place"}
{"text":"Sub-par at most. The service was awful. This is a Cleveland staple (so I've heard about the original location). Obviously got the corned beef which was a nice portion and surprisingly not overly salty. The fries were room temp to cold and clearly some awful frozen brand. This restaurant needs some major improvement if it's gonna last."}
{"text":"I've never been the original Slyman's downtown but it's nice to have a local branch in my area to indulge in this magical meat show. I've probably been here 4 times and every time I always order the corned beef even though there is a decent sized menu with plenty more to offer than their claim to fame. I always get the \"lite\" sandwich and still hate myself after it for eating too much. The corned beef is stacked about 4 inches high. Slather some thousand island sauce on the baby and its game over. 

FYI: check into yelp and get a free plate of loaded fries (which is basically fries and a corned beef with sauce) 

FYI #2 they also have brunch, would not have guessed that

Nice bar section with plenty of TVs to enjoy sports games. 

I must shout out the most hospitable, professional and attentive waiter whom I have had the pleasure of being served by, Matt. I was so sure he was maybe an under cover boss or something. He gives the service of a Michelin rated restaurant would give. Look for this guy and tip him well!"}
{"text":"The service was abysmal.  Waited for ten minutes and no server came to the table.  Management did not offer an explanation or anything complementary."}
{"text":"i would not return to this restaurant. we ordered a hot pretzel as an appetizer and when it was brought out to us the inside was completely frozen. the waitress took it away and brought us a fresh one after apologizing. unfortunately, this one was also frozen. our waitress apologized and gave us a free appetizer of our choice. we ordered potato pancakes but unfortunately they were drenched in oil and not very good at all. we ordered a reuben and it was not even warm. the cheese was not melted at all. the corned beef, while a massive portion, was chewy and not what i was expecting. with all of this being said, the restaurant itself is cute inside and the staff was pleasant and accommodating."}
