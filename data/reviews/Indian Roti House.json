{"text":"Came with a few friends who were craving butter chicken so thought of this place. We all ordered the butter chicken roti and we were all definitely satisfied. The place is a little run down but the food was excellent. Large portions, tasty food the only complaint was the long wait. We must have just ordered right after a massive take out order as we waited approx 30 mins while people kept coming and going after us with their orders in hand. Other than that no complaints!"}
{"text":"Don't go by the poor review below. This place is amazing. I went in on a whim and ordered the mattar paneer and aloo gobi. The curries they make are more authentic, rich in taste but do not sit heavy in your belly and better priced than any other indian take out. Best place in town! Huge portions, truly authentic taste. If you have a craving, go for the matar paneer. It's on the lower level, looks like nothing: so if you're walking past and staring at your phone you'll walk right by it. I know I'll be back !  Mmmm"}
{"text":"Excellent. I was here for a medical convention, and it was delicious. Spice was excellent. It is not an attractive dine-in experience; but the to go food is wonderful."}
{"text":"Amazing roti - very flavorful and the serving is huge.   The curry rotis are my favorite.    Staff is helpful and friendly - my advice is to call ahead as it can take 20 minutes, so not a good place if you're in a rush.   Always so fresh and you can request spicy or extra- spicy (my fav).  Only a few seats but rarely full as every one gets take out.   Also , limited parking so if driving to try their roti...it's next to impossible to find a spot to pick up unless you park illegally on QueensQuay"}
{"text":"Indian Roti House has the best roti's. Better than Gandhi Roti and Butter Chicken Roti. The only thing I dislike about this place is the poor service. Whenever I call in, I'm usually placed on hold for over 5 mins or I'm asked to call back later. I was even hung up on once.The 25 min wait for the food to be prepared doesn't bother me, however it takes a very long time for them to pack your order when you arrive for pickup."}
{"text":"This is one of the most underrated Indian Take Out places in the city. My colleague is a regular at this place and this has become my dinner every weekend since i tried it for the first time about a month ago. The rotis are hand made and the perfect blend of flavour and spices. They recommend calling ahead so you don't have wait for your food. Even if you do wait it's totally worth it. Beautiful pictures on the wall and the folks are always ready to talk to you. Butter Chicken Roti is epic! Biryani Rice is amazing. They have one location at Harbourfront which i will check out soon. The guy at the counter - Anuk is so warm (not very common in Indian restaurants) that i thought he's probably the owner. If you come here more than once a week you just say your name on the phone and they know your order.  Keep up the good work fellas."}
{"text":"Hello, long time user, first time review.  This place is a secret gem in the Beach which is filled with mediocre places.  The food is fresh and flavourful.  I've had both the chicken vindaloo and chicken tikka marsala.  BOTH were amazing.  The option to have a small dish with rice or roti for $7.99 is unheard of.  Try it! Bet you will love it."}
{"text":"love this place! and they are nice enough to deliver so no waiting time for me. Its nice to see Roti slowly becoming sort of mainstream. I had a lamb roti and it was wonderful. My GF had butter chicken and we ended up mixing and it was amazing."}
{"text":"Picture on the left is what I expected. Picture on the right is what I got.   I ordered five containers only to find them soggy from the sauce. I called the place to ask if there's anything they can do to help but the person I spoke to said there was nothing he can do. He also said that this is how it's served. Based on the picture below, I believe this to be false. I then told the person that I would post this online and all he said was \"ok\". I asked for his name and he said they don't give out names.   The attitude and customer service made this experience highly disappointing. They simply did not care. The worst part is this used to be my go-to place. On to the next one, I guess."}
{"text":"My experience of eating here has just solidified the fact that Mother India is without a doubt my favourite roti place in the city.  We stopped into Indian Roti House after a morning spent at Harbourfront. Courteous service goes a long way with me and my dining partner and boy, was it lacking here. I placed my order and was about to pull out my wallet when the gentleman at the counter picked up his ringing cellphone. I waited for him to finish up thinking it wouldn't be long - wrong. It was long enough that he asked me to repeat my order after he got off the phone. This should have been the moment when we walked out but we were hungry and curious about the place having read the positive reviews on Yelp. So ordered placed, and off we go to sit as we were told our order should take about 20 minutes.  Since I was in good company it took a while before I noticed that almost 40 minutes had passed since we ordered.  It didn't, however, escape my notice that a group that had come in after us received their order not long after ordering.  It's possible that they ordered the daily special and there was tons of the curry in the back, but it's still a crummy feeling seeing people who come in after you eating while you're still waiting.  After about 42 minutes the staff member called out, \"What did you order?\" which was my cue to blow up but luckily for him he had our mattar paneer behind the counter.    And after all that, it was just meh. The roti was stiff and hard to cut through.  The entire thing looked quite deflated because of an uneven distribution of the curry.  I did enjoy the flavours of the curry but the whole experience had soured me on the place and I just wanted to get out as quickly as possible. Since the roti was pretty cold it didn't take too long.  Highly unlikely that I'll be back - mostly because I'm not in the area often enough but also because if I have a craving for roti I'll be heading to Mother India."}
{"text":"Good taste!!   We really enjoy having indian food here, and especially it is near our home!!"}
{"text":"i tried the chicken roti.  my bench mark is Ghandi Roti which I like very much.  i'd say it's very similar to ghandi.  and perhaps slightly better.  the roti shell is softer and more delicate.  in fact, i dropped my fork and was too lazy to go back to get another one so i just ate it with a knife.  it was pretty easy to cut through it with just a knife.  the filling was more aromatic.  there was a green herb in there i couldn't identify.  could have been thyme but not sure.  definitely gave the flavor a lift.   everything is made to order.  I had to wait 20 min for mine.  lots of other people waiting.    place has virtually no seating.  only 1 standalone bar table and 1 row of window bar seats. some seating outside.  the location is quite inconvenient as there is limited parking on queens quay and it is off the beaten path of the downtown core but if you are near harbour front this place is definitely worth stopping in."}
{"text":"There is nothing more delicious of medium spicy chicken roti. I'M ADICTED....... I eat here 2 time a week or evertime that I can"}
{"text":"Went back recently and was very disappointed to see all the prices raised. 27 bucks for two butter chicken roti is a bit much for a take out place! The food is still great, but we won't be going back if we could have a sit down meal for the same price."}
{"text":"The food here is oily and very unhealthy probably. Still, it's open most hours and is pretty prompt and convenient."}
{"text":"Very nice and cheap food, We tried the lamb tandoori and the butter chicken and they were both excellent, 12 and 14 dollars respectively."}
{"text":"They just open a place  on 471 Church st  ( Church st and Alexander ) order the butter chicken roti ,it was delicious ,I'll sure go back and try other stuff"}
{"text":"Had the lamb vindaloo roti (spicy).   Flavors were rich and authentic.   Dish was more than enough food for one.   Look forward trying their other dishes the next time in town."}
{"text":"DO NOT order the samosas for delivery/pickup...unless you like your samosas soggy and swimming in the sauce that they do not put on the side.  We placed an order for a party and were extremely disappointed when the samosas arrived completely inedible, drenched in sauce.  Not drizzled...completely immersed.  What's worse is that we called the restaurant (giving them the benefit of the doubt because surely this was some kind of mistake!) only to be told that this is how they serve it and that they were not willing to do anything to help us out.  Extremely disappointing and a waste of food.  Buyer beware!"}
{"text":"Unbelievable butter chicken roti. I miss it already."}
{"text":"Fast delivery, tasty food, and large portions. Excellent choice for quick takeout or pickup."}
{"text":"Really bad taste. Also the wrap was so inconvenient to eat. The filling inside was not dry and made the food messy. Also I felt sick whole day because of spices and so much oil used."}
{"text":"Best butter chicken roti in Toronto! Found this place a few weeks ago and I have had it several times. The service is friendly and the food is consistently good. Definitely recommend this place if you are in the mood for Indian take away"}
{"text":"Went there with friends and were pleased with the portion and taste of the roti. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Great authentic Roti. Everything I have had on the menu here is delicious with good portion sizes."}
{"text":"Environment is average. Roti was filling. My party ordered a butter chicken roti, medium spicy, a lamb curry roti, and a shrimp on rice. The best out of the 3 is definitely the butter chicken. Others are just too overpriced imo."}
{"text":"Decent tasting roti shrimp curry , the number and size of the shrimp was i of significance compared to the almost similar tasting curries with various meat options. Add pickled mango or lime pickle to your order to make the over powering spice more balance. The amount of folded bread with curry layers in between was to much . The rice and curry option is a way better choice. The place for sure needs a good house keeping and definitely in need of some kind of fan or air conditioning . It seems that roti house intends to make the customer perspire way before the arrival of their order :-)"}
{"text":"I went inside this place without any expectations just to get something to eat for my wife... But after seeing a bunch of people waiting I decided to orders for me....  Got spicy chicken biriyani & butter chicken .. We both liked the ethnic taste.. I was not out of the world or so.. But best curry I had in last few years .. Quality of the food is great too..."}
{"text":"In from the States for work.. Yelped helped me find this joint and I am salivating.  Simple saag paneer and butter chicken roti's.  Made fresh so you have to wait about 10 minutes but worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Service was slow and it took almost 15 mins for our roti & biryani to come out but that butter chicken roti was one of the best roti's I've ever had."}
{"text":"A must stop for my wife and I. Come 3 to 4 times a year when in town to see the Jays. I cant get enough of the curry chicken mango roti while my wife loves the chicken tika marsala roti. Place is nothing to look at but for the best roti I have ever had I cant praise this place enough. Go Jays!"}
{"text":"The store manager invited me back and assured me that staff will be trained to handle these situations. I am grateful and only want this business to grow. The food is great. I also noticed there is an oven to keep some dishes hot and there is food in the oven that is ready for quick purchase."}
{"text":"Good food.. but very slow service. I think these guys only have one burner  to cook everything..."}
{"text":"The Indian Roti House on Church is an unassuming little shop in a basement store front on Church near Alexander St. underneath a coffee shop called Fuel.  I didn't recognize some of the menu items , but the gentleman at the cash register patiently and happily outlayed some menu items and answered my questions.   After chatting a bit, he recommended the Malai Kofta. After a reasonable waiting period I had a large dinner sized portion of the tastiest, most flavourful Indian roti I've had in Toronto. The flavours, textures and portion size were outstanding. With tax the dish came to roughly $11.25.   I was actually so happy with the dish I ordered another helping to split with my wife for lunch the next day ( one order could do well for lunch for two providing the folks aren't both completely famished).  My fellow diner had the potato and eggplant roti which was also great.   I'll be coming back any time I'm in the area. Overall the quality of the food and friendly staff make this a must-try joint."}
{"text":"I am deeply disappointed by this restaurant and their service. We have waited around three hours for our food to get delivered and on top of that, we were treated in a very rude manner. I can't believe that this restaurant is actually open and operating with such a low quality service.  If the manager is reading this now, please work on getting you and your team some customer service courses/classes (customer service 101 will really help) because you really really really need it."}
{"text":"I check in here once a week. My absolute favorite roti in the city. They make an awesome lamb curry roti that no one even comes close to. I have tried the butter chicken roti and it's good but not my favorite. I have tried their biryani but the rice they use isn't upto par."}
{"text":"The location is gross inside and I saw a cockroach climbing the wall. The food was tasty, but I woke up the next day with a killer headache -- which makes me think that they use MSG. I only gave this place two-stars because the food WAS tasty and I devoured it...but I won't be going back!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered the saag paneer and it was divine! Prob just as good if not better than Ghandi on Queen. They give you a proper amount of filling so totally worth the slightly higher price point. One roti feeds two people. Will definitely be back to try some of the other options.   Also cash only."}
{"text":"I live right next to the Roti House and absolutely love their saag paneer. It's more of a take out place than dine in, so I'd call ahead prior."}
{"text":"So me and a few friends decided to order food from this place, for them to bring it to us at work. we ordered a total of close to 100 dollars in food from their website, after which we were prompted that there is a 75 minute waiting time for the food (they have an order tracking system which is a huge farce). After close to 90 minutes we give them a call, and they say we never received your order!  After that we asked for compensation having waited an hour and a half for our order and the manager was very rude and said we wont get compensation since the issue was from their website and not them. Seemingly he doesn't understand unfortunately that the issue does stem from them and not us.   After close to 2 and a half hours and numerous calls to which we were very rudely treated we finally got our food. The food wasn't what even close to worth the ordering price, let alone the hassle required to get the food.   To summarize: Horrible horrible horrible service, very run of the mill food, expensive. I would steer well clear from this place. Unfortunately I am forced to give a 1 star rating, I dont think they deserve that either."}
{"text":"Saw some Yelp reviews and knew I had to grab a roti before I hopped the ferry to the Islands. Mild Butter Chicken Roti with a mango lassi? Yes please!  Restaurant size: This is a small place with a few spots to sit and a \"patio\" out front during the summer; more of a take-out place than a sit and dine. Reinforcing this is the general uncleanliness of the plastic table set up. BUT WE'RE NOT HERE TO TALK ABOUT THAT TODAY!  Portion size: You are going to be FULL. Oh yes, are you ever going to be satiated.  Service: I read a tip which suggested asking which rotis were available, or how quickly certain ones can be made, and decided to act upon it. Thankfully, it would only be a quick 10 minutes!  Food quality: This was my first Indian roti, and it certainly will not be my last.I was quite surprised at how saucy it was, and the flavours were nothing short of amazing. The mango lassi was refreshing, though a part of me questioned how fresh it was... This was not a particularly \"cheap\" meal, but the experience was worth it.  Final thoughts: If you've got a hankering for Indian roti and are in the area, definitely drop in!"}
{"text":"One of the best Indian food around the area. Like the butter chicken roti.   Call in advance as there is about a 15 min wait.  Prices are a bit on the high side, but I feel that you get what you pay for here."}
{"text":"Order ahead and come in to pick-up. They are made fresh and my eggplant and potato roti took about 20 minutes after ordering. It was October and pouring so I sat inside where it was super hot!! At least on hot summer days you could wait by the lake. The two guys working were literally running back and forth from the kitchen, so they really make every effort to get food out fast. Very friendly.  The take out bag weighs a couple pounds - definitely two meals (and only $7.95). The roti wrap is light, soft and splits part easily with a plastic fork. The potato and eggplant filling is spicy when ordered medium. Other than the spice, a mild curry flavour and the occasional burst of a coriander pod, it didn't have a whole lot of flavour. The filling actually tasted better when I heated it up the following day.   I will definitely go back and try a different roti. Maybe a chicken saag or something that would have a more flavourful filling. Quality lunch options in this area are lacking, so I think Indian Roti House would be a good place to stop every once in a while."}
{"text":"Had the lamb roti last night and it did not disappoint. Ready in 5 minutes, large portion and so yummy."}
{"text":"Great little spot on the waterfront. We order takeout from here all the time (remember to call ahead), and we particularly enjoy the chicken vindaloo and saag paneer rotis."}
{"text":"I had mutton rotti here it was really good they made it close to the original indian taste which is hard to find in canada"}
{"text":"The food here is AMAZING! They have really large portions too, I am barely able to finish it all in one sitting. Every time I go downtown I try to eat here. The food takes awhile to be prepared (even though its totally worth it) so its better to order ahead. Also expect downtown prices, especially because its close to the Rogers Centre and CN tower."}
{"text":"Soooo Good. Love this place because its arguably the same quality food as big names of Indian food in Toronto such as Banjara for much cheaper. I recommend the Lamb Madras Masala if you like spicy and Tikka Masala if you don't. There are plenty of vegetarian options as well. Last tip, you get to choose rice or roti with your meal, if you are very hungry or just want value for your money get the roti, you get much more curry/meat and hence is more filling."}
{"text":"This is the best roti I have ever had, and some of the best food I have ever had in Toronto.   I got the lamb madras masala (medium spicy - I really like spicy things, but asked if \"hot\" was Indian spicy or white person spicy. Dude said it was Indian spicy. While I could have *handled* something spicier than the medium, medium was quite spicy and actually absolutely perfect, as I was able to enjoy the flavours without crying. If you do not like spicy or have a low threshold, maybe order something else).  The first bite I was blown away by how delicious it was. An absolute beautiful blend of spices. I could barely handle how intense and amazing the flavours were.  Also, the roti was HUGE. Halfway through I was full, but it was so delicious I kept eating! I just could not let it go to waste.  I also had a mango lassi, which was amazing.  I am in pain because I ate way more than I should have, but it was just SO GOOD!"}
{"text":"Loved the lamb curry roti! The portions are huge and enough for 2 people. They have a bunch of different roti options and everything is hot and fresh!"}
{"text":"Best roti ever! We usually get the saag paneer and the vegetable korma, both equally delicious. Order ahead to avoid the wait."}
{"text":"The Best. Roti. Ever.   Get the saag paneer.   Holy sh*t."}
{"text":"Excellent butter chicken roti. I had mild and it was VERY spicy. The mango Lassi is a must :) Very delicious lassi and the roti is in large portions. My husband and I could have easily split one. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Hands down best Indian I've had. Chicken Biryani is bomb here! You can get all the Roti's on Rice as well, this is my new favorite order - Medium Spiced Butter Chicken on rice, the Butter Chicken here is in my opinion the best in Toronto, if not Canada, if not the world!"}
{"text":"I ordered a matter paneer roti and it was OK.  I thought it lacked flavor.  The portion size was decent but for $10, I expected a bit more.  I find the rotis at Ghandi Roti are superior to the rotis here.  Also I ordered through tasteaway.com and was disappointed to find that they bump their prices on the site.  Wish that was transparent before ordering."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing... I was blown away from the taste.  Comes in a takeaway sealed plate and it packs all the flavors in there."}
{"text":"Tasty roti, well filled. Could have been a little spicier as I did ask for a hot vindaloo but well worth the walk to get to this place."}
{"text":"as an Indian food addict, i must say that this place wakes me at night at the thought of their butter chicken roti. I am salivating actually as I write this review. SO AMAZING... worth every mission I have made down there, including the times when you need to RUN just to make it before they close shop.  **Must try: The butter chicken roti and the lamb korma roti Chicken is succulent, creamy sauce, and just overall extremely flavourful. The lamb korma is also divine.   **Call with your order before hand, they are super packed on weekend nights - and rightfully so."}
{"text":"We got the butter chicken roti and the lamb madras masala. We also got a piece of naan on the side.  Super hot and flavourful, and I thought it was a good portion size. We got \"spicy\" for both dishes and that spice is no joke. Had our ears ringing the entire meal but it was still so delicious!"}
{"text":"Very satisfying discovery this roti place. We had the butter chicken and lamb jalfezi rotis-ordered mild which turned out on the medium hot side- and I can honestly say its up there with the best rotis in downtown Toronto."}
{"text":"I had the Shrimp Biryani while one of my friends had roti. Both were so tasty and made to order. To be noted the biryani was quite spicy, however I had plenty to eat the next day so the order sizes were on point and worth the price. Fresh and flavorful."}
{"text":"The food here is so bomb!! The wait is a little ridiculous but that's because its made fresh and you can definitely taste the difference. Its more of a take out spot so call ahead to save time!  I had the butter chicken roti it was pipping hot and creamy! I also got the gulam jaman which was so rich and sweet wow! So sad I was just visiting Toronto otherwise I would definitely come way too often!"}
{"text":"I really like this place. If you've never had a roti it's basically a curried meat or vegetarian dish wrapped in a thin soft bread. Sort of like an Italian piadina but much heartier. Indian Roti house does a fantastic job of it and the portion is huge. I'm partial to the lamb vindaloo (it's quite spicy). They also do a decent lamb biryani but the roti are the highlight.  I've only ever ordered from them for delivery but I walk past it on my way to work and it's a tiny shop, order for take out, walk across the street to the harbor front and prepare to take half a roti home for leftovers."}
{"text":"This place has gone down the tubes. Ordered an aloo gobi (cauliflower and potato) roti and it tasted like Chef boyardee sauce with heat. The roti was nothing more than a stale, soggy tortilla. Yuck. Never again."}
{"text":"Service is soooo s...l...o...w Do not come here if you are in a hurry or really hungry like I was. It took a full thirty minutes for my Roti...!? Other people who were behind me were served before me.  And the food was just okay...not worth the wait. Although, my stomach disagreed later...I think e wraps are wheat based because it caused much distress later that night. I had presumed the wraps were made with chickpea flour as many Roti wraps are by I should have asked.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"Yay! I'm a fan and a big one at that. I happened upon this place during my first few days in Toronto when I was craving Indian food. This was the only place we found on Queens Quay. Tried the butter chicken roti and fell in love.   We ended up moving closer downtown and the Church location became a staple go-to for fab tasting Indian food. Although the butter chicken is awesome, I love the Korma, Chicken Biryani and Chicken Masala as well. I'm always looking to try new things on their menu and they've never failed me :)   Its not that cheap but the quantity they provide for the cost is pretty good. Also, usually when we order in it costs around $35ish (3 items). But I'll still keep eating here. :)"}
{"text":"Half of the menu is Vegetarian, and it's all delicious.  Quality and flavour is similar to Queen West's popular Ghandi Roti, so this place is a welcome addition to the Harbourfront 'hood.  Traditional Indian fillings include peas, spinach, paneer, chickpeas, potatoes, eggplant, malai kofta, etc. The roti bake is excellent. Spice levels are on the high side, so stick to mild or medium unless you can reeally  handle the heat.    Portions are large, and run about $8-9 for the veggie options."}
{"text":"Perfect for lunch when you're in that area in downtown Toronto. Probably one of the only cheap(ish) non Western food places around. The roti is extremely flavorful and definitely worth it. Watch out though, it's not fast food! Can take around 20 or more minutes to prepare your food. Just order online or by phone ahead of time and you'll be fine. The portion you get is definitely enough for 2 meals or at least a nice snack afterwards."}
{"text":"Dont miss out on the butter chicken roti. Seating is limited inside but there is plenty of outdoor seating across the street. Recommend: butter chicken roti and lamb saag"}
{"text":"This was a tiny mostly takeout spot on the lake. After we ordered, my friend and I wished had split a single order because it was huge! If this was near my house, I would have a single serving for 3 meals easily.   The variety was good and the food was very tasty. And though we were in Canada, spicy means spicy so yum! Although this was mostly takeout there are a couple of spots to eat at the counter (and some outdoor seating but brrr it was too chilly/rainy the day we went).   Definitely a great spot to get some quick delicious food. WISH I lived nearby."}
{"text":"I've seen this place a few times biking down by Harbourfront and always wanted to try it. Yesterday I had that opportunity and boy was I disappointed. I order my usual whenever I go to any Indian place; spicy butter chicken roti. Where should I start:  1. The roti was too thin and flimsy - it couldn't hold the sauce. 2. Butter chicken sauce tasted too creamy. 3. The consistency of the sauce was almost like a soup. 4. I asked for the hottest and I got sriracha level hot - I was expecting more from an Indian place. 5. Even with all that sauce in the roti, I don't know how they managed to keep the chicken so dry.  I'll be sticking with my go to spot, Gandhi Indian Cuisine. That place never fails me."}
{"text":"Huge portioned butter chicken roti although on the expensive side, I did have it in two sittings so... it's like a $7 meal (total was ~$14). Definitely not bad at all.  Came by for take out and waited a long as/s while with no AC and a fan that blows towards the kitchen instead of the patrons. Be sure to take down their number and call ahead of time so you don't have to sweat your ba/lls off while waiting for your food.  I got the medium spicy butter chicken roti but feel like I should have gone for the spicier one (I lovehabanero and scotch bonnet peppers so you can gauge the level of spiciness).  I would definitely return but will call in ahead of time!"}
{"text":"This place is great, fresh roti and fillings, made as spicy as you want it.... $11 more than fills me up.  Great bunch of guys who run it too, always up for a quick chat..  Only downside is because its fresh you should order in advance as it takes them 10 minutes to make."}
{"text":"Yummmm!!!!! I had the butter chicken roti extra spicy. The first bite is an explosion of flavours and textures in your mouth. The smooth creamy gravy mixed with the slight chewiness of the roti and the little pieces of chicken breast (was perfect for me I hate huge chunks of chicken breast..I'm definitely in the minority here)..and a bit of potatoes that just added another level of texture.   Being Indian I'm very picky on how butter chicken should taste like..this is pretty close to a home run for me.  This thing is huge ..I would enjoy it more if I sharedit with someone  4 stars because I ordered delivery ..and it's a minimum order of $20 plus a $2.50 delivery charge and ended up ordering the \"yogurt sauce\" that was watered down plain yogurt with 3 cubes of cucumber and the aloo tiki which could have been decent but tasted like it was cooked a couple days ago .. Wish I didn't have to order that just to have to make up the minimum order requirements"}
{"text":"After I ordered, I was told the wait would be twenty minutes. The shop itself has very little seating, most of which was occupied by customers waiting for their take out orders. Luckily, I was able to stay occupied by waiting near the harbour across the road.  I ordered the medium spiced spinach and potato curry substituting the roti skin for rice. With it I order a side of nann which did not seem as fresh as the rest of the food. I was impressed by the lengthy vegetarian options. Also, this place does not play games with their spice! As a spice enthusiast I was very impressed by the medley of flavor in my dish. Excellent sized portions, 1 order could work well for two people or left overs later. The food was well worth the wait. Above all this spot is a take out place so plan to either picnic by the harbour or hold out until you get home."}
{"text":"Love this place, tiny take out shop with limited seating.  The roti is good as it gets. It is large as well.  My go to is the curry lamb roti, remember to ask for mild if you cannot handle the spice as it is very spicy here.  Only problem I had here was one time they gave me spicy instead of the mild I ordered and I didn't noticed until I got home.  Man it was like I was breathing out fire but I couldn't stop eating it since it was so good.  I think I had like 2L of water that night. One bite and drink some water.  Also another time I found a long hair on the roti. So I tossed that one away.  But overall roti house is delicious for a quick meal."}
{"text":"Really tasty food. So glad I followed the recommendation from the others and ordered from this place. Since I can't do spicy we ordered 2/10 and it was perfectly mild. The saag paneer roti was delicious and so was the butter chicken. Will definitely order again!"}
{"text":"Food was really good - not great but good  - was staying at the Radisson so it made it easy to get. Had Chicken Tikka Marsala , really good but for me to much gravy and not enough chicken. Little sloppy to eat. Samosa was very different from what I am use to but they had alot of flavor and again very good.  Try it as it my be the the best of the choices of food in the area"}
{"text":"I have to say I am more than pleased with the Indian Roti House on the Queens Quay.  Previously named Jaipur, this place has much better flavour and menu selections that make things simple.  I am a huge lover of lamb and this place didn't disappoint. It was lean and only minimal amounts of fat. The flavours were bold and just what you want from a solid curry.  I think I've tried both the Jafarri (peas, chauliflower, etc) roti and a tikka one. Tastes really good.  This place would be a 5 if the price started under 10 and if the service was a bit quicker. Had to wait 25 minutes for a take away order."}
{"text":"I like the concept but this place is definitely not worth 5 or 4 stars . Food was average but decent , there are several better indian places in Toronto. You can try it once though , just for the concept.  If you are preparing a chicken dish it does not mean that you just throw chunks of chicken in the dish. ( indian cooking 101 - fail) .  The owner should paint the walls , the place looks old."}
{"text":"Not worth. As name suggest roti house but instead of roti we got rumali roti made of maida. It's disappointing. Also, malai kofta was full of spice. Test wise it's OK."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what the hype is. The lamb roti is soooooo salty. The mango lassi was just meh. However the wait time was not as long as others made out to be. Maybe 15 mins. Also overpriced."}
{"text":"This place is right downstairs from where I live. Their Roti was good but I am no longer returning because of the way they treat their customers. I stood in line for 20 mins to order my food, which took another 20 minute to make and another 10 mins in line to pick up. I specifically asked for mild and the end product I got was the most spicy version. The box clearly labelled spicy and the guy crossed it out and wrote mild on top. Who was he fooling? I go back to the shop to inform them of this mix up. The guy at the counter told me someone was going to call me the next day to provide a full refund of my food. Heard nothing even to this day. Terrible service and I can't stand a business that doesn't keep its promises. Never again!"}
{"text":"Hole in the wall. Don't get fooled by the look, it's legit Indian food, packed like a burrito. The ingredients are fresh, even the potatoes! Had the lamb tikka masala roti, really loved it. The authentic spice with fresh lamb was incredible. Large portion, the box is pretty heavy. Canned soda for a dollar. No washroom, so make sure you go to the Tim Horton around the corner before hand."}
{"text":"The rotis here are great. Lots of meat and the roti has good texture. It's around $10 for a meat roti.   As others have said there is not much seating and no parking. I think that they take credit card.   I prefer this place to Ghandi cuisine because these rotis are mainly meat inside. I thought that Ghandi had a lot more potatoes."}
{"text":"Lamb tikka masala roti. Tender and lean chunks of meat (no fat whatsoever) with just a few small pieces of potato, smothered in a thick, rich sauce.  Mmmm...    You can eat one if you're really hungry, or split it into two meals.  The average price for a roti is about $8.95 for vegetarian choices and $10.95 for the meat eaters.   If you're not feeling the roti, you can get rice instead.    Food is cooked to order so the wait time is about ten minutes when it's quiet, more if there's a line.    Do I care that they got a conditional pass?  In June?  Naaaaaaah...  I feel just fine.  :)"}
{"text":"You can smell the amazing food coming out of this place just walking near it. The roti served here are very tasty and very reasonably priced. They aren't bursting at the seams filled with, umm, filling, but they can definitely fill you up. It may be a good idea to call ahead of time and place your order because it takes a while to prepare-- the food isn't re-heated under lamps and you can certainly tell when you first bite. Plus the walk along Queen's Quay is beautiful, no matter the season."}
{"text":"Wow that's huge says my girlfriend!  If you want to impress chicks get the roti here, it's a full container size. My girlfriend lives about 5 minutes run away so whenever I'm hungry I CALL AHEAD and run there and back for a quick exercise.   Make sure you call ahead, it can take 25 min - 30 mins they say. Sometimes it only takes 20 but sometimes they are right.  The place is not that good but good for take out and it's cheap and always yummy.  I just wish they have more variety and options.  Food 4.7/5 Service 3.8/5 Ambiance 2.0/5 Value 4.5/5  =========  Overall 4.3/5"}
{"text":"Freshly made, tasty roti made with a smile.   The location is conveniently close to the lake, where the alternatives for good food are limited. I was pleasantly surprised to find this place.   This is mostly a take out place with limited indoor and outdoor seating. It looks like it's run by two young guys - one at the cash and the second cooking. They are efficient at their work, friendly and polite.   The rotis can take some time to be cooked, so be prepared to wait 10-15 min depending on number of take out orders.   I had the saag paneer and split the portion between dinner and lunch the following day."}
{"text":"Butter chicken roti YUM!  If you've never been, it's definitely a must try. Initially, I ordered it medium spicy but that nearly took my head off. Here I thought I could handle my spice :( mild is fine for me though. Their lamb biryani is quite good as well and has chunks of boneless lamb.  I would suggest ordering ahead of time for pick up. They make their food fresh so it takes a little longer to prepare. Last time I ordered the roti it took 20 mins so I went for a stroll on the harbour.   It's a very small place with a couple tables to eat but in the summer there are spots outside as well."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem among the typical places lining Queen's Quay. I've had two different types of roti here, first trying the Butter Chicken and more recently trying the mango chicken curry.   The prices are very reasonable considering the portion. The entire container could easily be split into two meals. The mango chicken curry last night was priced at 13.95 and was delicious! The flavour is developed nicely with lots of sauce. It was very busy when I went and the order still came out in 10-15 minutes. The service is friendly, too.  Definitely try this place out."}
{"text":"Ok I've mastered the best order, medium spice chicken tikka masala OR spicy butter chicken. My fiancé and I crave it and the portion is huge. Even with the recent price increase it's a lot of food inside that roti. Good deal! Wish the inside was cleaner looking, the patio furniture is off putting but don't let that deter you, the food is fantastic."}
{"text":"I had my first Roti dish here, taken-out. Very impressed. The curry was rich, the flavor was intense, and the roti was very soft! I will go back :)"}
{"text":"The paneer tikka roti was delicious!  The seating is limited (indoor & outdoor) and tends to be pretty busy late night.  The eatery is deli style (pick up your food at the counter) but definitely worth a visit if you're in the area.  Be aware, it's cash only & they take USD ($), but at a steep price (1:1.1, while the conversation rate was 1:1.32 when we went)."}
{"text":"I was in Toronto last week for a conference, and saw the Roti House on Yelp.  Since I love Indian food, it sounded absolutely perfect; my only problem now is that we have no roti in Indianapolis...I must speak to the folks at our local Indian restaurants about this!     I had a saag paneer roti, medium spice, and it was absolutely delicious!!  I've had saag paneer many times, but I have to say, this is the best I've ever had; the spices are so fresh that the flavor just explodes with each bite.  I'm not just talking about heat here, I'm talking about the complex blend of spices that really made this dish something special.   Medium spice was perfect for me; some heat without overpowering the dish.  The chewy roti went so well with the creamy spinach and I loved the addition of potatoes.  The cubes of paneer were fresh and delicious.   As others have noted, they are making the food to order, and so if you don't call ahead, expect to wait.  I only had to wait about 15-20 minutes for mine, and it was well worth that wait; this is not food that has been sitting on steam tables all day.   No, there aren't a lot of tables, this is a carryout place, but if the weather is nice, like it was during my visit, there are a ton of benches on the Harborfront across the street that make for wonderful picnic spots.     Advice for anyone who is in town for a convention...this is a very short walk from the Convention Center...and you wanted to see the Harborfront anyway right?"}
{"text":"Best Roti in town, wow!!! Went there for lunch with an Indian friend, ordered saag paneer roti, taste is so good, cream and full of flavour. Definitely come back to try other roti"}
{"text":"This place is amazing for the price. Legit Indian food with warm Roti that is chewy and soft. You can order ahead of time using their app and also receive a discount whenever you do that. When you arrive, the food is hot and ready for you to pick up. My friend lives just a 5 minute walk from there so it is an easy pick up whenever I am visiting.  There is a good portion of meat in whatever you choose whether it is the tandoori, curry or masala.   This place is delicious and definitely a great place to hit up when you are rushed for food. They also deliver!"}
{"text":"This is a good place for Indian fix along the harbour front area. Theres is only seating outside and I recommend either ordering online or calling ahead of time. During busy times, its takes 20 minutes to make because everything is made from scratch.   I ordered the butter chicken roti - it was good! There are loads of chick in the roti with a little potatoes. One roti was super filling and you could probably share on with a friend.  The butter chicken (12.99)  was flavourful but I wished it was a little more spicy and had more tomato taste. But pretty good if you are craving Indian."}
{"text":"Had take out for lunch one day. Got the butter chicken with rice. There is a lot of food and each bite is heavy with flavour. After eating I was ready to fall asleep."}
{"text":"Got the medium spicy butter chicken roti to go. Guy taking the order was pretty surly. With tax it came to about $15.  It was alright. For $15 I expect a lot more. Also, my order of one item took about 25 minutes to get, which seemed excessive. Can't say I was super impressed or I'd go back."}
{"text":"Step 1: call ahead to order (takes at least 30 mins to prepare fresh food)  Step 2: pick up take out (the place is small and a bit run down)  Step 3: go home, put on some sweats and enjoy!   Honestly one of the best rotis I've had and I would've never imagined such fresh food to come out of a dingy restaurant at the bottom of some condos.   The portions are huge and can easily feed one person for 2 meals!"}
{"text":"This is my Go-To for whenever I'm craving any South Asian meals.   It's very tasty.   However, their services aren't the best and they aren't honest in the sense that they claim never to have change even after you've tipped the staff.   So I'd advise you have the exact amount you need and don't except to collect any change. (From $20 below)"}
{"text":"Now this is something that Pennsylvania needs more.. butter chicken roti and lamb madras masala roti.. all made to order.. awesome flavour and genuine authenticity.. !!"}
{"text":"Small shop in the ground floor of some condo buildings on the harbour front. Love the lamb roti from this place. the portions are absolutely humongous, I could never finish everything in one sitting and always had to leave some as an afternoon snack. There are only a few seats in the shop, so you are probably better off bringing the food back home to enjoy. The pictures on the wall are interesting, I always just end up staring at them waiting for the food."}
{"text":"Tried almost everything on their menu and found that butter chicken was the best! Have to get it with naan. None of the other dishes stand out as much as their butter chicken. Service was kinda slow though."}
{"text":"Tried the butter chicken roti and the chicken jalfrezi roti. I ordered the chicken jalfrezi because the description made it seem like it would have more veggies in it than the othet choices. But it mostly just had some peas and that was it in terms of veggies. In terms of the curry sauce, wasn't that impressed with the flavour.  You can choose mild, med, or spicy. I got med and it was a good level of spiciy-ness.  Butter chicken sauce was a bit better. But still don't think I'd come back here. It wasn't very memorable, and a bit on the pricey side for what it was."}
{"text":"Excellent roti shop in downtown Toronto. I had the butter chicken roti and there was a good portion of chicken and the roti bread perfectly balanced the curry sauce. It was cooked perfectly and formed a perfect envelope pouch, not dry like some other roti shops. I also had the garlic naan bread on the side which was great to mop up the extra sauces. 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Let's start with the first person you meet when you enter, very poor reception. Unfriendly and made me wish I hadn't ordered on line.  The food is very expensive, and has little taste. They drowned my usually crispy samosas in a sweet watery sauce that totally destroyed the inner flavor and left the outer shell limp and flaccid.   The butter chicken had little taste, with dry flakey chicken. The watery riata finished  off a terrible meal.   Zero stars, don't waste your time or money."}
{"text":"Awesome place! The food was delicious with great spices/flavour and a good meat and potatoes to sauce ratio.  Always lots of people there and coming for take out which is always a good sign. Great to see a local place doing well in an area with lots of chains.   Got the chicken vindaloo and went with the medium spicy option. Good spice level but i like spicy food so I will probably up to hot next time.  If you like roti, hit this place up.  Even a few tables outside in nice weather."}
{"text":"If you know going in what to expect, this place is great. Phone ahead with your order or place your orders online. You can make your order for a future scheduled time, or pick-up ASAP. This restaurant is strictly a grab and go spot for me. Seating is limited inside, there's 2-3 small patio tables outside and that's pretty much it. The building isn't fancy, don't expect it to be. I usually get the butter chicken roti, which is enough for 2 meals for me. Service is slow - do NOT walk up and expect to get your food fast. Always order ahead and you'll be fine. It's fresh, tasty and that's all I expect out of this place."}
{"text":"My first visit to this place and it was dissappointing. Papdi chat was not a chaat at all. Just the chat puris being served as is.  With a sprinkle of onions on top.  We ordered the roti's since that what is is famous for , the two stars are only for the Channa masala roti, mutter paneer roti was a disappointment so sweet was the curry. A complete let down"}
{"text":"The roti is pretty amazing. No wonder why people are willing to wait 45 minutes for their order."}
{"text":"The foods always fresh and delicious! The chicken tikka masala roti is my favorite.It's as close to authentic Indian food as you can get in this neighborhood.   FYI though, this is more of a take out place with very limited seating and they usually take 20-25 mins to prepare your food."}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong food here is amazing, for the price. I used to get takeout here once every couple weeks. However, on my last trip one of the dishes was wrong and when I brought it to their attention they said that is what I ordered. When I said that I don't want the dish they didn't even offer me a discount on the dish I actually wanted, and I had already paid... Will not return here again."}
{"text":"We had saag kofta and Chana roti. Delicious and fast service! Two people can easily eat from one order, if you're not starving. Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"This tiny, modest place is a delight! I've enjoyed the food very much! Chicken Tikka Masala one of my favourites. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I ordered the Butter Chicken roti. Worth every penny! Nice pieces of chicken. Very fresh. Huge portion. Great gem in the Village. Worth a try"}
{"text":"The restaurant is a pretty unassuming place, located along a stretch of shops and restaurants at the waterfront.    There's two tables and some countertop seating.  It's not really a great place to dine-in.  The food is served in takeaway containers so it's easy to grab the food and find a spot outside.  We went in intending to order the Butter Chicken Roti but the wait was 45 minutes so we asked what the fastest available item was.  Lo and behold, we were able to order and receive two orders of the Chicken Tikka Masala in 5 minutes.  The portion was large and decent.  The taste was pretty good but nothing earth shattering.    Overall, decent takeout place.  If you're not picky and don't order in advance, just ask for whatever is available quickest."}
{"text":"First off, let me start by saying, WOW. im here at the Delta on Lower SImcoe on the 44th floor on a mild 4 degree day in Toronto, my last day here. ive seen the Indian Roti house before here in the city and always wanted to try it, nothing was stopping me today, so i venture out.  a nice 10-15 minutes walk from the Delta here on Simcoe, down to Queens Quay W and another few minutes walk.  walk in and the place itself is small, 2 tables and a sitting area at the bar ( outside seating was not setup ) so the space, nothing to write home about, but im not critiquing the decor.  The Food: Lamb Vindaloo with Rice and a Mango lassi to cut the heat... which was a nice refresher, full of mango flavor and thick. My order came to about $15, not bad. Took about 15 minutes so i knew it was being cooked fresh and to order which is nice. The food arrived and it was piping hot, fresh and vibrant with aromatic flavors that blew me away, like nothing ive ever experienced. It was spicy, comforting, euphoric and pleasing all at the same time.... so I ate slowly and savored every damn bite. Spicy tomato gravy with nice chunks of lamb and the odd 1 chunk of potato. DEE LISH  i would definitely return when im back here in the 416 to try something different"}
{"text":"It's sooo good! I rarely eat Indian food but the mango mixed with curry is just so refreshing! So yummy and sweet+sour(although a bit salty at the end of the eating) but it's just an amazing experience eating by the harbour front in such a sunny day and enjoy the Indian curry before biking trip!  Will deff go back for other choice! Cheers!"}
{"text":"Why do I keep dating women that live near the best roti places AND then break up with them?  I miss her so much.  But damn, I really miss this roti joint too!  When we first began dating, this was more of a standard Indian food take away place.  And it wasn't bad at all.  But then it became this roti place.  Holy smokes!  Great move!  Like Mother Indian or Gandhi, you have a nice, simple menu, a decent wait for the food, great value and unmatched deliciousness.    The restaurant is still pretty much a take away but with Harbourfront across the street, this is not a bad thing.    If you live in the area you are lucky--please enjoy one for me!  Not sure if this is quite worth the commute out unless you are planning on hanging out near the water.  And that can only happen in fair weather.  This place exists mostly for the condo dwellers in the area--they need something to watch TV to after a hard day at work :)"}
{"text":"When you're tired from a day of traveling and just kickin' it in your Airbnb, you may want takeout. When this happens, call Indian Roti. Or, hey, you don't even have to call them. You can place your order online and not have to talk to a human (my favorite method of ordering food). Everything we ordered was DELICIOUS. And they give you the option to adjust your spiciness level (I went with mild because I'm a wuss and it was still slightly spicy). I got the chana masala and a veggie korma dish, served with rice, and I ordered naan. My husband, the carnivore, got a lamb dish in roti and chicken biryani. His conclusion: \"Pretty good\" (this is a glowing review from him). We ordered enough food for 4 people and the price was still decent. Leftovers are delicious, so I recommend getting as much as you can!"}
{"text":"If you're a person that gets hangry, order atleast 20 mins in advance online or over the phone! This's the only thing you need to know about this place! Almost everything is super tasty. I ordered over the phone and it was ready when I got there. Also, it's not ideal to dine in coz there's very limited seating available, so prepare to stand and eat or do a take out. Would visit again!"}
{"text":"I love their Chicken Madras Masala...!!! A must try. It has mouth watering flavours."}
{"text":"Y'all don't know your rotis. This place was horrible. I ordered a lamb curry roti, and the owner suggested the lamb madras roti. I agreed and asked for mild.  The roti was too spicy, but more importantly the lamb chunks were rock hard and unedible. I called the owner to let them know and got an apology and that was it. He made an excuse repeatedly he was on lunch time. Soooo the other three guys don't know how to cook?  For $15 I basically had roti and curry sauce, I'm really annoyed. There are some good roti places in Toronto, this isn't one of them. Don't waste your cash.  P.S. this was like eating roti, curry sauce, and OIL...and salt."}
{"text":"Visiting from out of town on business and had a craving for vegetarian Indian food. Found this place on Yelp and was initially skeptical due to the lack of sidewalk appeal. I took a chance and was so completely happy I did! Reviewers are right, this is a huge portion, but I managed to scarf the entire thing myself. Unpretentious and authentically delicious. I had the Chana Roti (mild) and loved it. Very \"clean\" food without a lot of additions or oil.   Tips: cash/debit only. No real seating. Made to order fresh (this is a good thing!), so prepare to wait 10 min for your food."}
{"text":"This is a great place to grab a cheap roti. Their portions are massive and be careful of their spice tolerance. Being raised in Asia I can take it but I've seen people's eyes water just from mild haha.   Most people giving this bad reviews hasn't had enough Indian food in their system I think. It definitely is heavy but that's how Indian curry is. If you're not a fan of thick, spiced sauces, you obviously won't like this. My only gripe is (weirdly enough) they're not as generous in their vegetarian portions than their meat portions. My partner ordered a roti with cauliflower in it and we found maybe 3 pieces of cauliflower in the whole roti. But overall, really good, strong tasting Indian food. It's easy to miss too so keep a lookout for a small shop."}
{"text":"My fav Roti place in town (just like Gandhi Roti). They have increased their prices, but they are still worth it. Most of my friends love their Chicken Korma, Tikka Masala and Vindaloo. I love their Saag Paneer and Biryani."}
{"text":"Great flavour. I had the Lamb Madras Masali Roti. Location was convenient to my work. The walk back to work was much harder due to the awesome food coma!  It was a small place with seating for 12 snugly. The food took long to make but that is the price you pay for good food."}
{"text":"Right in of the York Quay Harbourfront and next to Rabba food is a cozy little takeout place that serves the best authentic Indian Curry/Roti/Biryani/Butter Chicken dinners on the waterfront. Call ahead and place you order cuz is takes 20-30 min to make the food especially if there is a line-up before/after a nearby show. Call in your order and take in the waterfront then enjoy your meal anywhere on the Harbourfront or nearby HTO Park.   They also have a small functional patio and indoor dining if you wish. The Mango Lassi is delicious too."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious roti served in huge portions at reasonable prices. Lots of vegetarian options. Can't recommend enough! You can also order all entrees over rice instead of wrapped in roti.  (Don't go there for dining ambiance, though. It's a tiny--mainly take-out--restaurant with a few tables and stools.)"}
{"text":"At first I was a little skeptical because of the location and general look of the place it looked a little dingy.  However, the food was so good! Ordered the lamb curry roti, meat was cooked perfectly and curry was full of flavour. Definitely would go again but yea for sure the place could go with some \"sprucing up\"  Great food, highly recommend."}
{"text":"Its not quick, they don't accept credit cards and you can't eat at the restaurant (to go only), if you can deal with these downfalls the food is delicious and rather inexpensive too.  I found that one Roti dish was enough for dinner."}
{"text":"Really nice! Lots of room to eat. Really nice servers doing a great job. Food was really good and naan bread was amazing. I liked it here and food didn't take long to be made for dinner and it was busy."}
{"text":"If I could give this place 6 stars, I would. The customer service was the best. Furthermore, I was pleasantly surprised on the concept of how the food was presented inside the Roti."}
{"text":"Favorite place by the lake. The portions are generous and the food is delicious. One of the best Roti spots in the city. Quick tip always do a take out not much place to sit around. I usually go by the lake and eat."}
{"text":"You step out on the hot dusty streets of Mumbai with a mass of cars and scooters rushing around you. A street vendor calls out to you and says, try Indian Roti House in Toronto.   Furreal, pretty awesome portions and delicious curry without the travelers diarrhea. I split a butter chicken (medium spicy) and a chicken tikka masala (hot) with my fiancé. As a spicy lover, I must say that the hot was and left me wishing for some yogurt dip. The roti takes about 30 min to make, so definitely order it online when you think you might start to be craving that currylicious flavor."}
{"text":"Terrific addition to the village neighbourhood. Staff is very friendly and accommodating. Similar to the excellent Gandhi roti on Queen St.  Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"They have the best Indian food in the area. Their portions are very generous and the service is quick. Love their menu of meat and vegetarian options."}
{"text":"Decent medium quality Indian street food. It lacks the proper spices and quality ingredients of the higher notch Indian restaurants. The best way to sum it up is cheap Indian food if you're hungry and on a budget."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I love the butter chicken roti. It's so delicious! We each order our own, but split a yogurt. I love how there are potatoes inside the butter chicken roti. They are friendly on the phone and are always open, even on NYE day. It takes about 20 min to get your food, so call ahead if you plan on getting carryout. The parking situation isn't the greatest, but it's TO...what do you expect. Overall, A+"}
{"text":"This is decent place to get some takeout, as seating is very limited. One big fallback is that it is extremely slow.  They do have good options on their menu, and they have various spice levels. Just a heads up, the mild or medium is usually just right, anything more is a little too much.  The quantity is a very good size and very filling, and especially for me, I usually have leftovers. I have only tried their rotis and I like them. Whenever I am in the area, I definitely stop by, by of course allow for the wait time."}
{"text":"Service was very slow. There were 3 people in front of me and it took me 15 mins to be in front or the line for my pickup order.   Roti was good. I ordered butter chicken and chicken vadaloo, was satisfied with the taste and quantites of the chicken bites inside.   Would come back. I guess it's worth the wait when you really craving for some Indian gourmets."}
{"text":"Delicious. Simply delicious. First time here and we'll definitely be back! Place was consistently busy too, so it's well recognized by those who live here."}
{"text":"Serving style for roti is very interesting (like a canzone), easy to eat. Food was fresh! Four stars for these two things.  Didn't feel a hint of spice after asking for spicy. Place is tiny, smells like Indian food (you will too). Lots of pick-up orders."}
{"text":"Good tasting food for a decent price. Ordered the butter chicken Roti and it was delicious."}
{"text":"I have dreams about this place from time to time. I wish I lived in Toronto just so I could eat here all the time.  I had the butter chicken roti and it was so delicious. It was a good price for the size of the meal. Since they make it fresh when you order, you'll have to wait a bit. It is absolutely worth waiting for!  It's a small place with some seats. If it's nice out, you're right across from the waterfront, so enjoy the view as you eat outside."}
{"text":"I separate my curry from either choice of rice of roti. It gives me a dish of sauce with a few morsels of chicken. I usually order extra rice so I have both rice and roti which makes me courageous and full with a bit for a snack to toss in my fridge. For just under twenty dollars as opposed to fifteen I usually end up with two small meals. Eating a roti is just not enough to satisfy and a dish with sauce down the middle is also disappointing. The roti is often temperamental because I can taste the difference between reheated after on hold for a few days or recently made. However the practicality of having an in house roti maker who makes roti daily is just not a possibility in most kitchens. I love the curry and madras coconut due to the curry leaves that add an additional punch. Heat wise there is not much difference between mild and medium except a few beads of sweat that i experience with average medium curry. Know what you want on chilies before you buy. It helps."}
{"text":"Have always been impressed with the roti shell but fillings are hit and miss and absolutely horrible guest experience tonight. Husband waited in line and placed an order at 7:32pm for 1 chicken biryani, 1 veg roti w/paneer, 1 chicken tikka masala roti w/ paneer - $44 .  He paid and waited. And waited.  After 25 minutes (this is a walk up takeout counter), he simply asked them to cancel the order and give him a refund which they refused saying the food was already being cooked.  They offered him a credit, which tells me that it wasn't a big deal that he was cancelling, but refused to issue a refund.  It's almost another 15 minutes before he gets his 3 meals.  I called to follow up with guy who said his name was Sam and he said he wasn't authorized to give refunds.  It is ridiculous to make anyone wait 40 minutes for a takeout counter roti and refuse (or not authorize your staff to give) refunds."}
{"text":"Ordered the butter chicken roti and rice. Preferred the roti but would have liked some extra roti on the side to dip with the extra sauce. The rice had a grainy taste that I wasn't used to.  We ordered medium and didn't find it spicy. Would come back. They have 10% off pickup cash orders and you can preorder online."}
{"text":"Nothing fancy to look at here. Just a little storefront with a random dude chatting on his phone the whole time he's taking your order. But the roti is wonderful and we loved it."}
{"text":"They give good portion for the price. Their curry is pretty authentic as well."}
{"text":"Soooo good. I know its difficult to trust a random review on the internet but IT WAS SO GOOD!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place for so long. I've passed it every week for the last 6 months but my bf isn't a big fan of Indian food so I never got a chance to try it. Today I finally told him to get his own dinner cuz I'm having Indian!  I ordered on just eat after reading a few reviews saying it takes a while if u don't order ahead of time. The food was ready when I got there and still pretty warm by the time I got home. I got the chicken biryani and lamb tikka masala both medium spicy. Yes, I got both of these for myself. No, I didn't finish either of them. I got through about half the roti and a third of the biryani and couldn't stuff my face anymore. Since indian food can be quite heavy it doesn't take much to fill a person. The total came to about $26 and I'm pretty sure it'll last me another 2 meals so that's only about $9/meal which is reasonable.   Onto the food! Chicken biryani: really good flavour, lots of pieces of boneless chicken (I think it was breast). For me, my favourite part of biryani is the rice which I couldn't get enough of. I'm still picking at it in between writing this review actually. Even though I got medium this wasn't that spicy at all but I erred on the side of caution just in case.   Lamb tikka masala roti: the lamb was very lean which other ppl said was a good thing but I would've preferred a bit of fat on my lamb. The roti was kinda hard to cut through and a little more chewy than I expected. However, the spice level was perfect and the flavours were wonderful.   I'll definitely be back to try everything else on the menu!"}
{"text":"I love this place... I stop in at the Indian Roti House from time to time on my way home to pick up dinner. I usually rotate between the Butter Chicken Roti, Lamb Vindaloo Roti (spicy) or Mutter Paneer Roti,   In my last visit, I thought I would try something different and went for the Mango Chicken Curry Roti. It did not disappoint... In fact, it might be my new favourite dish from this place.   It best to call it in beforehand, they make it from scratch and it can take 20-30min to prepare. Plus there's a 10% discount for cash payments..."}
{"text":"Yes, you should order 15 minutes in advance of arriving.   The roti is very good. I've had the butter chicken, saag paneer, and chicken curry. Chicken Biryani wasn't as good as I found it too dry. Wish I could rate the food higher than three stars but I can't trust their spicy level. Sometimes medium is nothing. Sometimes it's very spicy. Too inconsistent.  For the price you pay, the portions are very generous. Always more than enough for the second day."}
{"text":"We came here at 9pm on Friday night and it was very busy! Once you order the food, it takes about 20 minutes for them to make it so we ended up walking around harbourfront instead of waiting in the small and crowded store. The food is very fresh (we got the biryani and lamb vindaloo roti) and it definitely satisfied our Indian food craving."}
{"text":"Was walking down Harbourfront and randomly decided to try this place. Had no idea it had such high ratings and we see why. I choose the lamb vindaloo stuffed roti and got to sample my friends Madras curry stuffed roti (lamb). We both thoroughly enjoyed both!!! The medium spicy was perfect. Quite spicy for us spicy lovers but not a suffering spicy. It was so good that I burned my tongue from eating it so fast. I just wish the curry was less wet and had more than 1 peice of potato. Loved how the roti kept dry and didn't become soggy as I was eating. The curry was flavourful and the lamb was tender. My friend found his curry a bit too salty but we both agreed this place served us some of the best Indian food we've had. For background, my mom is from india and cooks Indian food often. Honestly I would highly recommend this place to anyone and keep coming back. I also find it amazing how they have such a long and diverse menu. There is really something for everyone.   Rice can replace the roti for no extra charge.  Many vegetarian options.  They serve house made mango lassi and desserts.  Not much seating, very tight inside.   Ps. The vindaloo lamb curry made me SUPER gasy. I probably burped 40x after dinner."}
{"text":"Decided to order from their online delivery system.  Ordered bhel & spicy butter chicken roti. I also asked them to provide extra chutneys (green & red) on the side since the bhel can be very dry once mixed.   About 5 minutes after placing an order, I receive a phone call from the restaurant and the guy tells me they don't give out chutneys...period! I'm like \"huh?\" Restaurants usually want to accommodate but no not this one! Upon almost begging for the chutneys (which is so ridiculous) he still refused to do so!  The bhel came dry as predicted and the \"spicy\" butter chicken was completely bland. Ruined my appetite completely.  That was definitely the last time!"}
{"text":"Just keep calm and curry on!  Picture this: You've just come back from a long day of work/school/just all around tired in general and you need sustenance. But you don't want anything too far or expensive, in fact something perfect would be close by, a take out, fast and cheap. Enter Indian Roti House and their magnificent curries and biryani. I can't remember the amount of times I've defaulted to Indian Roti House as my takeout option, just because of ease of access, combined with the amazing money's worth I get for my food.   My recommendation is the lamb biryani or any of the chicken curries; extremely savoury, insanely delicious, prepared fast, served hot, and you really get your bang for the buck, priced at just around $11 (It's even enough meals for 2 meals tbh) Want to top it off with something sweet? Look no further and get that Mango Lassi. What's that? You wanted a fast meal but instead you're being treated like a sultan for a cheap deal? Did Indian Roti House just do some magic? Yes. Yes, they did.  Even before I moved to harbourfront, Indian Roti house has been a staple for my take out, delivery and fast food options; and now that I'm closer, even more so.  Their staff are pretty accommodating with the spice levels and will give you decent recommendations. Don't want your curry in your roti? That's fine, they'll make it separately for you!  Nothing short of a perfect score for this place! Cheap GREAT food delivered at fast speeds at an amazing price. Definitely getting your bang for the buck."}
{"text":"I did not regret my second trip to Indian Roti House. In an area lacking unique lunch options, this place is definitely worth checking out.  After my first time there, I learned you need to order ahead for pickup. Do this 15-20 minutes in advance. You will be thanking yourself later.  I also tried a new roti this time, the chicken tikka masala roti. (Fun fact: Apparantly chicken tikka masala is the most popular dish in England). This roti was much fuller than the last one I had. The roti itself had a nice pillowy texture and it was all flavourful. It wasn't as massive as Gandhi's roti, but this was a good lunch size for me.  A positive experience. I think I might be back."}
{"text":"Great Indian food.  I'm sure the samosas probably looked a lot better before we brought it home. The sauce was all mixed and if it weren't for the crazy amounts of plastic wrap, it would have leaked over the bag.  The lamb jalfrezi was ok, the sauce was watery and puddled on the bottom. The sauce tasted good, but would've been far better if it wasn't watery. The butter chicken roti was fantastic. The sauce unlike the jalfrezi was thick and the roti was soft.  They had a 10% off cash purchase posted inside and their prices in-store are cheaper than Just-Eat by half a dollar for some items."}
{"text":"The only reason I'm holding back a \"5\" rating is because I feel the place is a tad too pricey for the quantity. In terms of quality, it can rival any reputed restaurant in the great land of India itself. The saag paeer roti stands out as my favourite. The lamb tikka and madras chicken are a close second!"}
{"text":"incredibly annoyed how we waited 20 min for an extremely damn fireball spice roti.  got the tikka masala  in a spicy medium for takeout. got home, and the order was incorrect for SPICY!  (in which he confirmed with me twice for med)  i am up for spice, but not the fireball, linger in your mouth kind.  unfortunately, this meal is a toss to the garbage. 11$ not worth it.  but the portion and taste, aside from spicy, was pretty good i guess.  also, the customer in front of me, found a long hair in their food, but fortunately got a full refund, no hassle."}
{"text":"Severely disappointed with the meal. Ordered samosas for $6 and chicken roti for $12 (take out): asked for sauce on the side. Guy at counter said that he couldn't do that. By the time I got home, the somosas were very small, and they were incredibly soggy. Don't understand why you can't put the sauce on the side for take-out. Chicken roti was very bland. Mostly potatoes. Asked for it to be spicy. Guy at counter said that he could not do that??? They wouldn't even give me hot sauce."}
{"text":"Hole in the wall place that is just okay. Got the butter chicken roti (approximately $13) and it was decent, but I've had better butter chicken else where. The roti itself was pretty good.   Place, as the sign in the restaurant describes, is not \"fast food\". It takes about 20 minutes to get your food, so you should definitely call in first. I had to stand there awkwardly for 20 minutes for my food. I got it to go because I wouldn't want to eat there anyways. Such a sketchy vibe."}
{"text":"Environment: small take out restaurant with a few tables inside (very bare bones). You can smell the restaurant from quite a distance away.   Service: decent as far as a take out place is concerned. The person taking orders is frequently on the phone so you have to be patient. This is not fast food so if you just drop in expect a wait. They do deliver with $30 minimum.   Food: pretty good but nothing mind blowing. Big proportions at less than $10. Spicy and cooked fresh. Vegetarian friendly.    Tip: the medium is actually quite spicy. They do not take credit cards but they do accept debit. Order in advance."}
{"text":"Big fan of this place. Its a stone's throw from my place and the dishes are absolutely delicious. I've gotten a few of the chicken dishes and have liked all of them - not sure if you can really go wrong with any particular one. The portions are quite generous for the price and I often split it into half and eat it over two separate meals with rice. Good value!"}
{"text":"Stands out amongst a gentrified strip on chain restaurants and fast-food places, but isn't all that impressive in the grand scheme of things. The food is tasty and plentiful, but you can tell they're business plan is based on volume and turnover, not authenticity and quality. Everything comes with a sauce that's a little too soupy, the food is over-salted and the meat is dry. Not my favorite Indian place, but when I'm at work and need a quick fix it'll do."}
{"text":"speed and service aren't the greatest here, but they make good roti. the filling is tasty, generous and quite fresh - among the best in the city, imo. the restaurant itself is a bit dingy and could use a makeover. 3 stars. 4 if it's takeout or you're eating outside."}
{"text":"I was recommended by a friend to try out this place. The first time I went, I had ordered the Chicken Tiki Masala Roti. I felt sick after as the flavors were really strong and the meals was really heavy. It did not enjoy it was all you can taste was the thick sauce. I decided to give this place a second shot and ordered the Butter Chicken Roti. Unfortunately, I was disappointed a second time. It is definitely not my cup of tea. My only suggestion to people that want to try it is to order 30 min in advance as it can take a while for them to prepare it! Hope you enjoy it more than I did."}
{"text":"Looking at the Yelp rating, I thought I would give this place a try when I was in the area.   It's ok...but nothing special. I was expecting an amazing food experience here.   I got the paneer tikka roti which has a nice spicy curry with potato and paneer (it's a cheese that has a tofu-y texture type of ingredient), inside a roti wrap. The concept is great, and the prices are reasonable for the quantity of the meal.   The place does get busy with phone orders taken in advance making the service slow, so I would not suggest walking in and ordering (as mentioned in other reviews).  Also, there is very limited seating, and the appearance of the place is not the best. I guess if you live in the area and get takeout it's a good option - otherwise there is comparable Indian food at other restaurants downtown."}
{"text":"I love this place!! I get the lamb madras medium and it is so satisfying! The staff is also super friendly and the service was fast - about 15 minutes!"}
{"text":"Wandering around Toronto on a 24-hour layover, we got tired of the awesome scenery near the lake and decided to get some food. The bf wanted poutine, but I was coming down with the sniffles and demanded curry to clear my head. The place looked pretty dingy--limited seating, as other reviewers noted--but the price was decent and they took credit cards, so we were in. Turned out well!  For ~$10 a person, we each got a big delicious roti. It looks kind of like a cute personal lasagna, pan and all, but it's much more like a wet burrito made of naan with curry inside. Bf got lamb tikka roti, spicy--it was tasty and quite spicy. I got butter chicken roti, medium--it was AWESOME. Probably could have been two meals if I wasn't starving.   The wait was around 20 mins but we didn't mind so much. If I were a local, I'd probably call ahead. :)  Dunno when/if I'll be in Toronto again, but if I came back I would DEFINITELY spend another day walking around the boats on the lake and eating some curry from this place."}
{"text":"What a find!  If you are in downtown Toronto near the harbor front and want to avoid the pricey downtown food prices try this place for a fantastic meal. Roti is basically a serving of richly spiced Indian meat or veggies sauce wrapped in an Indian bread- like an Indian burrito. We tried the tikka masala lamb and just couldn't stop going for one more rich, spicy bite. This little hole in the wall is authentic, portions are generous and it does brisk local business. Very little space to sit, though, and not too clean (there's only one guy taking care of orders, register, dining area, etc)."}
{"text":"Really good Indian food. It's a take out place but there are some chairs and a table there. They will give you forks and knives but they don't really cut the roti (flour wrap) very easily. I would recommend order a mild. I like spicy and I got medium and it is more like hot."}
{"text":"Incredible flavours. Our favourites at the lamb tikka masala and butter chicken. Everything is made fresh. Order ahead and pick up. One roti can easily last two meals so they are really reasonably priced. Best spot in harbourfront!"}
{"text":"I am surprised it took me so long to check this place out. Considering I live in the building beside it.  Anyhow I had a crazy indian food craving today that I couldnt shake.  I ordered chicken curry roti spicy. Took about 15 minutes to make so I ran upstairs to drop off my stuff and come back. Service was super friendly and quick. The roti was huge!!! The spices were perfect and chicken obviously super fresh. This hit the spot perfectly. Too bad were moving in a week! Definitely check thia place out if you're in the harbourfront area instead of the thai place next door."}
{"text":"Best best best Indian Food I have had last while. My best friend lives in the condo where the front door is directly next to the restaurant , and the condo loading door is next to restaurant back door. Every time I visit her from from front door or back door I would smell the deliciousness !!!! Finally I tried their butter chicken roti! OMG it's out of this world good! I have tried roti many times before this one beats them all. Their chicken was so tender the whole butter sauce was creamy bit sweet and very very vey delicious !   Make sure order Medium spicy level if u usually love spicy . I think the first time I ordered it the Medium felt Ike suicide. However this time medium feels like medium. The chef obviously does it by eye measuring. So better safe than sorry, u don't want stomach burn.   Enough for 2 people ! Ordered Nahn at side so good!"}
{"text":"I'm not a big fan of Indian cuisine, but this place is great. High quality and delicious food. Very flavorful experience  and the portions are big."}
{"text":"The food here is 10/10. The flavours are top quality. Fast service, cheap meals. Large portions - one order of roti is enough for two people. This is a hidden gem at Yonge and Wellesley. The chicken biryani is my favourite. Out of all the Indian restaurants in the Church-Wellesley neighbourhood this one is the best value and best quality I find. I would definitely recommend! They also give 10% off if you order online and pay in cash - not a bad deal."}
{"text":"The worst chilli chicken ever. It's like ketchup mixed with water. 3 pieces of chicken. 15 pieces of Bell peppers. I hated it. There it away. Don't ever order the specials. Kadhai chicken is the same, more Bell peppers and less chicken. They replace meat with either potatoes or bell peppers. I'm appalled."}
{"text":"Awesome Roti  Call ahead and it's ready and made fresh every time! Thanks guys - we love your food!  Mark"}
{"text":"Have been wanting to try this place for a while, finally got a chance this week. Ordered the Chana Roti (vegetarian with chickpeas). I'm actually surprised by how mediocre the food was. Usually even bad Indian food is pretty decent, but this tasted like the sauce came out of a can. (I'm sure it didn't, but it TASTED that way. Not good at all).   The roti didn't seem all that fresh (do they make them on site?) and definitely, the man at the counter was not friendly. I felt like I was annoying him by asking for suggestions of what's popular. I might give them another chance and get something else on the menu, but if another item is as overtly NOT delicious as this first roti, I won't go back. As it is, I wouldn't recommend this place based on first experience."}
{"text":"I would never recommend ANYONE get food from here. They have the most despicably bad customer service - paid $30+ for food and $3 for delivery and never received my order and when I called, not only was I yelled at by the person working there, they demanded that I repay the delivery fee (for a restaurant less than a 5 minute drive from my house). As this whole thing took 2 HOURS, I asked for a refund and they blatantly refused even though they still had my food at the store. There are 100 better Indian restaurants in the area - absolutely no need to go to a place with such deceitful practices. So completely disgusting and disrespectful."}
{"text":"Love the butter chicken roti! Always prepared to order so it's usually a 10 min wait which is well worth it! You can choose your spice level which is great. Large portions and great value for the price. Friendly staff. This is more of a takeaway type place rather then a sit down restaurant however there is some indoor and outdoor seating."}
{"text":"Best Indian food in downtown. Spoke with the chef. Vegetarian food cooked separately from meat. Separate pans, ladles and oil for vegetarian items. So my dear vegetarian friends, you can eat here without guilt. Tasty food, new concept of gravies and curries inside a roti to eat just like burritos. May be called as indianized burrito rotis. Spice level can be adjusted according to your preference."}
{"text":"Great indian food, slow ish service but the food was worth the wait. The curry Roti was fantastic!"}
