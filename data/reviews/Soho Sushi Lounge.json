{"text":"Soho has recently renewed its menu. You've got to try their specialty rolls. Ex. Saveur de la mer, soho tango etc etc. It tastes out of this world! After trying many different sushi places, Soho still offers the best quality fish and most tasty sushi, not to mention the serene ambiance. Definitely a must try for sushi lovers."}
{"text":"This place obviously writes their own reviews. No way in hell this place is worth 4.5 stars!!!  Very Very stingy on the fish.  Sushi assortment for two was mostly cheap stuff like egg and imitation crab, but only a few tiny thin pieces of salmon.  Very dissapointed.  Very dissapointed with both this place and Yelp."}
{"text":"I go there for lunch many times.  Small place with very very friendly service.  I always have the 12-piece sushi special, comes with a very tasty miso soup and a salad with a nice sesame dressing.  The sushi is tasty, at par with other sushi places in the West Island without the frills."}
{"text":"Whether it's for takeout or to sit in the intimately cozy atmosphere of the restaurant Soho sushi lounge in my opinion is the best in the West Island has to offer. Not only is the quality of the sushi consistently delicious but the host and Master Chef always strive to make the customers comfortable. I've gone there so often that I've reached the point where I simply ask for the chef's choice when it comes to placing my order and I know I will never be disappointed"}
{"text":"Best Sushi on the west island.  The owners Dustin and Sara take great pride in serving fresh well made dishes."}
{"text":"Great food. Not expensive for the quality. Nice ambiance and the service was excellent. Will be back."}
{"text":"A little gem hidden within an unassuming strip mall. Tiny but warm room.  Friendly but not unctuous service. Fresh fish solidly prepared. I really enjoyed it. Bonus: ask to hear Dustin Dao's cd. DD works at Soho. He's very talented and we enjoyed the cd so much at Soho,we bought it! (I'm in no way affiliated with the musician, just loved what we heard in the restaurant.)."}
{"text":"Amazing sushi! More on the pricey side, but definitely worth it. The restaurant is nice and cozy. The service here is amazing (think its run by 2 people, and they're so sweet) Definitely will be back again."}
{"text":"Looking for outside it doesn't seem convincing to eat inside although as they say \"You can never tell a book by its cover\" or \"Don't judge a book by its cover\". After going inside and eating a great 100$ sushi supper and sake w 3 people it was well worth it. I strongly recommend it for people trying it out :) It might not be THE BEST although it's very very close to there :)"}
{"text":"Our family of three always searches sushi places in every town we visit. The 5 stars does not do justice to this sushi. We barely touched the soy sauce or wasabi because the sushi was so flavorful. It had a mix of textures and testes that made us fight for the pieces on the platter. This is on top of the clean, neat friendly family atmosphere and the great relaxing music. I wish we lived closer (we live in NH)..we would come here weekly."}
{"text":"Best chef chosen vegetarian sushi! The rolls were creative and full of flavor. Their miso soup is one of the best. It's got a deep flavor and lots of tofu and seaweed. I really liked their garden salad and banana tempura. Thank you for a delicious dinner!  If I lived close by, I would go there weekly."}
{"text":"Small restaurant in the West Island. Service is very polite and the owners are attentive to their customers. Sushi wasn't very flavourful but chicken plate and gyoza were delish."}
