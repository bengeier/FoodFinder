{"text":"I stopped at Demetrios this morning around 7:15 a.m. for breakfast.   There was no one in sight so I sat in a booth.   No one come to the booth to offer coffee or take my order.  After 8 minutes of waiting for a server, I left.   Horrible customer service.   If you are open that early in the morning, you need to make sure you watch who is coming into your restaurant.   This is totally unacceptable.   All of the low prices in the world can't make up for bad customer service.   I will never go there again."}
{"text":"Food is always delicious. However, their main hostess is EXTREMELY rude...she yells over the phone if you apologize for not being able to hear her and then will slam it down. Very very unacceptable. Especially considering a hostess if supposed to be welcoming, right?"}
{"text":"I love this place. It's so delicious and family friendly. I like food because it is a reasonable cost and delicious food. My kids love it here want to go everyday. Thank you Demetrios!"}
{"text":"This is one of the worst restaurants in Cleveland.  The waitress never even asked if I'm ready to order, or asked if she could get me anything else.  Very non friendly from the hostess to the servers.  I try to not stereotype typical Cleveland attitudes, but this is exactly the kind I'm talking about.  The food was also very bland, my mushroom omelette was swimming in grease, and my hash browns were as tasteless as an Andrew Dice Clay stand-up routine.  Anyway, stay away from this place!"}
{"text":"Took my friend from out of town for breakfast here and was pretty disappointed, especially as when I drive by the place it is always packed.  Our heavily tattooed server looked like she should be working a biker bar and was pretty indifferent to us.  Especially for breakfast, you would think the one thing they would drum into the wait staff is to keep the coffee filled.  Ours came back once, at the end of the meal.  I had the \"homemade\" corned beef hash and eggs and it was another BIG disappointment.  The hash had the exact look and taste of a can of Hormel hash you could pick up for a buck in the supermarket.  Really, overall this was a pretty crappy experience.  Especially disappointing as this is one of the few family owned breakfasts places in town.  I won't be going back"}
{"text":"I used to enjoy this place for the price until my daughter found tiny flies in the syrup bottle on the table and I went to the salad bar and it was COVERED with \"fruit flies \" which they told me they treat regularly. Told my husband who is a plumber and he said they are not fruit flies they are \"sewer flies\" and quite common in small places that don't want to pay regular maintenance of their main lines to have them jetted out . I won't be going here anymore."}
{"text":"I just love this place. I recently moved so it is now about a 30 minute drive, but it is worth it. The restaurant is always clean, the staff is always so kind and friendly,  great home style cooking,  and a great value. This is a local non chain restaurant,  and I like that.  Probably been here 20 times over the past 4 years, and I keep coming back."}
{"text":"My husband and I had breakfast this morning. The waitress was something to be desired. The cost was pretty inexpensive. The food was good for the price. Will most likely go back again. It was a decent breakfast, as far as breakfast goes."}
{"text":"There aren't too many places that I can say I've been going to for 15+ years.  This is one.  I have very fond memories of going here with my grandparents and parents.  The little lunch buffet is a great deal. The server was sweet and accomodating even after my partner dumped her water on the floor.  I actually enjoy a good cheap all american meal.  I know not everyone remembers their grandparents taking them here for meals, but I do and I'll keep coming back. 

Went back for breakfast for the first time. Gotta say it was delicious, inexpensive and filling.  The staff was as kind and attentive as can be even though I was alone and taking up a table during a busy breakfast rush.  I love this little place."}
{"text":"Pretty big menu for such a small restaurant. I had a grilled chicken club for lunch and it was awesome. The grilled chicken was juicy with a great flavor. They had a lunch buffet and salad bar as well, but I didn't get that. Very cheap for a sit down meal! 

I'll definitely be back! The service was decent too."}
{"text":"The food is absolutely atrocious. The server was incredibly rude, I don't know if I'll ever go back. STAY AWAY"}
{"text":"We were looking for a place to eat Friday night, and most places had an hour+ wait. We passed this by accident and saw it was packed. They have a fish fry on Wednesday/Friday and I can say we were not disappointed. Lake Erie has some of the best Cod/Walleye/Perch I have ever had and this place gives you all you can eat for $7.99."}
{"text":"Poor quality all around. Eggs are consistently overcooked, and even my waffle was bone dry. Service is ok, usually friendly. But you get what you pay for at Demetrio's. It's about what I would expect for a $2 breakfast."}
{"text":"If coming on a Sunday come early or prepare to wait. The restaurant is sort of small but the breakfast buffet attracts a lot of people plus the good prices. 

The food is okay nothing really exceptional but not bad either. The service matches the good an is just okay. 

Looking for a cheap and filling place to eat this is the place."}
{"text":"I love this place! Sorry to be so brief but there not much to say the service is great, the people are friendly and they treat a customer like a friend. The food is delicious and you can't go wrong with their breakfast. Come in, take a seat, grab a cup of coffee and relax."}
{"text":"Our first visit was on a Friday during  lunch. We ordered the buffet. A very good deal for the price! We were able to add the salad bar just by purchasing a drink with our meal. All in all the food was very good. My only suggestion would be that they offer more choices on the buffet itself. The staff were very friendly and attentive. We would definitely return."}
{"text":"Not sure what the deal is here, but the quality of the food has really gone down hill over the last year or so. I think I'll pass on this place from now on."}
{"text":"I know all of this is opinions and everyone is entitled to their opinion- but, I don't know how anyone could give this place one star. 

I had an entire breakfast (eggs, potatoes, toast) for $1.99. Coffee was good and our service was good. Our food came so fast that I was literally shocked. The waitress apologized bc it was out and I was doing something - lol

All you can eat breakfast bar for $6.99 and their salad bar (on the breakfast bar) was huge!

We will be back!"}
{"text":"I went here with my parents, who are retirees on a Friday morning. Where do I begin. Getting in was a nightmare. Its a haven of older folks and the aggravation starts pulling in. Its a busy road so when there is a break, seize it and pull in, right? WRONG. You cant even pull in till they scoot in. I was getting mad before I even parked. I stood by the sign that says \"please wait too be seated\" like any normal reasonable adult would do. Not these clowns. They were just walking in and sitting down. SCUZE ME!! Im seething at this point.  Finally they give me a table. NOPE!! Surrounded by lil old ladies with gawd awful granny perfume. All different ones too. I dont know if youve every smelled \"Taboo\" but it should be a taboo YUCK!!!
Nope, seat me else where. Host nodded understandingly and took me elsewhere. Thank God. I get seated and my parents walk in.10 minutes later finally got coffee. Waited 15 MORE MINUTES TOO ORDER!! Look I know its busy but hell they are all ordering the same damn senior special how hard can this be? Food came and hey, its basic breakfast food. Nothing phenomenal just eggs and toast etc. One damn refill only after I grabbed someone. 
SO.
The food is fair and reasonably priced. 
If you don't mind the old people and their staring, have at it. Me? Ill pass."}

{"text":"My wife has been talking about this place forever. It's been a tradition in her family. Finally I have experienced it. Great place indeed! The ambience is quaint family casual. There are a lot of little nooks with booths in them and hanging plants everywhere. They have a salad bar and two soups made fresh daily. The day we went it was chicken paprikash and wedding. Both were good. The salad bar had fruit, macaroni, pasta, green bean and potato salad, coleslaw,  a few different types of greens with TONS of toppings. The weekdays the lunch deal is an entree, soup & salad bar, dessert  and a drink for around 8 bucks. I got the country fried steak, mash potatoes and rice pudding. First I am WAY TOO PICKY when it comes to breading and the this wasn't bad at all. The gravy was awesome and as leftovers as well . My wife bragged about the rice pudding for months! Needless to say I'd go back just for the pudding. I'm sorry I don't remember the waitresses name but the service was excellent. We took all of her recommendations and they delivered. 5 star family diner for sure!"}
{"text":"granted we arrived near closing time but I feel no matter what time you arrive to dine any eating establishment should be prepared & willing to provide quality service & food .. I had ordered what was a tuna wrap sort of thing & it was in a word inedible .. the bacon on the bottom of the pile of tuna was beyond greasy .. the tuna itself bland & tasteless .. the pita/wrap stale & the handful of potato chips were large crumbs from the bottom of the bag .. when our server asked how I was enjoying my meal I told her the truth & while she apologized she said she would also alert the manager .. I figured surely the manager would approach our table or at min remove it from our bill or offer me something to replace it (which by that point I had lost my appetite) but neither happened .. our bill arrived & I got the pleasure of paying for food that went into the garbage .. NEVER AGAIN .. will not be back"}
{"text":"So far, the service sucks here. My waitress expected i wanted some nasty ass coffee. Then I ask for a water and I don't get it until when my meal comes out. Nobody acknowledged me when I walked in. And she was so fucking rude. I will never be back. Why do you think their so cheap because everything sucked."}
{"text":"There are only two things I can always rely upon if my life depended on it.  Mainly, my mother's word and a locally owned and run good diner & family restaurant.  The food here is excellent and the prices are from the 1980's!  Talk about incredible value.  I come here because I can get good quality food for about half of what I would pay at one of those faceless, national, overpriced chains.  My only complaint, and this is true almost everywhere I go these days, is that the servers really need to LISTEN to the customers, and WRITE down their requests, in detail if necessary.  I had to remind our server that she forgot my cole slaw, our coffee, my child's milk, and my side of broccoli.  Perhaps she was just having a bad day?"}
{"text":"We've gone here twice now, maybe 3 times. Every time we both come back with sick stomachs. The waitstaff are very friendly, and most the people in the place seem so as well. However the food is bland, and the coffee tasted like it was strained through a dirty sock. My bfs orange juice tasted suspiciously like Sunny D. 

If you looking for cheap food that will fill you up then here is your spot. But beware you'll spend the next few hours on the toilet. Even my boss came back feeling ill one day, but I can't comment on their experience as I was not with them."}
{"text":"Food was good. I had the breakfast buffet for $6.99.  Everyone was friendly EXCEPT my server, Heather.
  I will return but will make sure I don't have Heather as a server. 
   She DEFINITELY needed to go home or take some lessons from the other servers."}
{"text":"Came to this place because my husband works in the area, said they had a good cheap breakfast. I ordered the crazy Omelet with toast and home fries. My home fries were cold, and pretty much leaning more toward the super done side. My omelet had canned mushrooms in it which totally threw the taste off of it. The sliced cheese inside my omelet wasn't melted, which is kind of scary. They were super busy, my kids loved the breakfast buffet, which was small and ideal for kids, cheaply priced as well. Refills came great and the staff was nice."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner.  A lot of comfort foods on the menu.  Most come with salad bar and soup which is nice.  On this night, soup was chicken noodle and french onion soup.  Chicken noodle was meh... noodles were all disintegrating.  The entrees were OK.  I'm sure just reheated but it took a while to come out for whatever reason.   Salad bar was pretty fresh.  All in all a decent place to eat.  Will have to come back for their clam bake."}
{"text":"I'm cheap, the breakfast is cheap...can't get a clean, safe egg breakfast for $.99 anywhere. Close to Marc's."}
{"text":"Stopped by Demetrio's for a quick dinner while we were in the area. I ordered soup and salad bar as did most of the people at my table.

The chicken soup was very tasty, hot, and fresh. The chicken was delicious and the broth was thin like water, but delicious. The salad bar was also very good with lots of fresh veggies to choose from.

My son ordered chicken tenders and fries, as per usual. I tasted his fries and they were good too. The meal was under $30 for four of us, so that was wonderful. We were in a hurry because my daughter had to get to volleyball practice and our friendly waitress was accommodating. We didn't get any refills while we were there though. If we're in the area again, we'll definitely dine here again."}
{"text":"I can only speak to Demetrio's for breakfast, and to describe it I can really only use 4 words: YES YES ABSOLUTELY YES. 

I stumbled upon demetrios because it's around the corner from my boyfriends work and we wanted to grab breakfast before he went into the office for the day. He'd heard \"good and cheap\", so to us that means \"what do we have to lose\". 

First of all, there's a breakfast buffet. I would typically be ALL OVER that buffet, but we were meeting his business partner so I decided to stick to a plate. The menu is a simple, typical breakfast menu, with extremely low prices for the Cleveland area. He ordered a breakfast that came with French toast and a ham and cheese omelette for $5.99. We're not talking half a slice of thin toast and a one-egg omelette. He really did get a great sized omelette AND French toast. I got the corned beef hash with eggs, toast, and potatoes. Great portion and exactly what I expected. 

Service was fine. Simple older ladies who generally give good service. It didn't turn us off, and we will definitely be back for the food and price regardless. 

And as we were leaving they were putting out the salad bar... we'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Not a big fan of their home fries, they are hand cut and never really cooked. Every omelette I have received, vegetables are never sautéed. Service is sub-par if not unpleasant. However, the hostess they typically have is always kind!"}
{"text":"Sure, we may have had an age difference of about 30 years between us an any of the other patrons...but seeing the old couples come in added to the charm.

Demetrios originally drew me in with their cheap breakfast signs.  99cents? $1.99...sign me up!

At the same time, those breakfasts are pretty meager and you're required to get drinks...so in short, you'll just want to order whatever you normally would order.

Our service was great...prompt with lots of coffee refills.  

I ordered the gyro omelet which had plenty of yummy gyro meat and they brought me out a side of tatziki/cucumber sauce.  Delicious!"}
{"text":"Demetrios is a fine, lovely place.

In the sixties, Roger Waters spoke to a generation when he beckoned for a dirty woman. A dirty gal. 

America's youth listened, understood his lament then did each other and drugs enthusiastically. But youth can only last for so long. The days of sex, tabs of acid the size of a Nutter Butter and Boone's Farm fortified wine are gone. The people are still here.

And I know where all those people have gone. Yep. Demetrios Family Restaurant on Broadview Road. Now they want a dirty breakfast. And wow can they find a good and dirty breakfast buffet here. The bacon fuses in the warming tray, the eggs are scrambled on the flat top so you can actually see them weeping under the lights. The pancakes are as heavy as a man-hole cover but not nearly as big. The toast is wet. The juice is tang.

When was the last time you had tang? Tang is awesome in the morning with a breakfast buffet that even has gyro meat. Sometimes they have gyro meat. If they don't they should. They should have gyro meat in that breakfast buffet. Or pork chops. They should have pork chops in there somewhere. It would be better than the great it is now. It is certainly filling. Coffee.

The waitresses are nice and they know that if you're not 75, you'll leave a tip so they treat you special and the crowd is angsty and old and seems like they's itching for you to grab at their sausage link so they can cuss you out. And maybe you do. Maybe, just for the hell of it, you bump the guy with the big fork just to see what he'll do. Let's do this.

And then you remember he was a hippy once and he says, \"it's cool, man. Here you go.\"

Awesome life lessons at an awesome amazing breakfast place where you can get tang and full and happy and ready to cross that border up into the Broadview Heights you've come to need like a drug of your own. Or wait. That's me. Nevermind that last part."}
