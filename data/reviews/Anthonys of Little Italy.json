{"text":"Portion of each meal is hugee, and will definitely make you full. I had my lunch there with my parents there and we ordered different types of pasta. One of my favourite dish is the seafood pasta. Totally recommend it! They all look similar, especially since it's all covered in red tomato sauce, but don't worry each dish have different taste from one another. Dining inside the restaurant is also very classy, kind of like fine dining, so it's really nice for more formal events."}
{"text":"A very good dinner.  All four of us enjoyed our pasta dishes immensely.  The chef handmade gluten free breadsticks and pasta for one of us and all agreed both were excellent.  And the piano player there on Saturday nights is a star.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"The food and gelato were excellent and above average in quality, but the waitstaff had some shortcomings. Even though the restaurant  was more than half empty, our waitress kept trying to rush us out and cleared dishes before we finished them. Also, the prices were a bit high."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic ! Our server Corinne was amazing! The food was so decadent and mouth watering ! The manager is an amazing guy and the all a round service was great! My boyfriend and I went for my birthday, I never even heard of little Italy till now, I'm so happy we found Anthony's."}
{"text":"While my party waited for our reserved table to become available, quite a while after our appointed time, we were treated to the sight of the restaurant manager apologizing to a group of angry-looking diners for \"the delay.\"  By the end of my own meal nearly three hours later (!!!) I had some idea why.  The service was not openly rude, but it was ridiculously slow and inattentive, the worst I've experienced anywhere in years. I had asked several guests to dinner for a special occasion, and ended up feeling deeply embarrassed at having brought them here.  The pricing implies moderately better food than what they're serving, but at this point they'd have to pay me an hourly wage to sit at one of their tables, feeling invisible, regardless of whatever might eventually appear on a plate before me."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! My family and I have enjoyed eating at Anthony's for years. Great wine selection, excellent food, and delicious ice-cream. The food is exquisite! Only one thing, please bring back the lobster ravioli!   Andrew was very friendly and did an excellent job. Gracias Andrew!"}
{"text":"My wife and I are mainstays at Nido Italia, and even had our rehearsal dinner there.  We always go there when in Little Italy.  They aren't open on Monday, so we tried this place.  It was EXCELLENT! We started out with the calamari for an appetizer, and it was the best I have ever had.   For an entree I had Chicken Marsala, and my wife had Chicken Florentine.  Marsala reduction was sweet and delicious, and the Florentine was Romano cheese crusted with spinach and tomatoes.  It was also superb.  For dessert, homemade salted caramel gelato.  We will definitely have a difficult choice next time we come to Little Italy."}
{"text":"Disappointed.  Have to say we expected better of the #2 Italian establishment in Little Italy.  Someone must've called off because the hostess was our server for the evening.  Service was slow even after it took 15 minutes for someone to come around for our drink order.  The house salad was decent; the fried green tomatoes tasteless.  I ordered the chicken parmesan while the other two in my party ordered the spaghetti bolognese.  The chicken parm was pretty good but the bolognese sauce was overcooked and  heavy on the tomato paste.  The meat in the bolognese tasted like ground pureed meatloaf...was kind of bizarre.  Overall, the experience was just 'meh'; we won't be in a hurry to return."}
{"text":"Excellent Italian food and service is always very good.  The wine list is good as well.  Favorites include the meat balls in Arabiata sauce."}
{"text":"Deanna and her hunsband have owned this place for 14 years. Last night was truly magical and some of the best vegan food we've had in Cleveland. Walnut fig salad with heirloom tomatoes and a balsamic lemon dressing (no oil), heirloom tomato flat bread with fresh basil and a balsamic reduction, and our main course of mushroom walnut meatballs, an insane cheesy seitan lasagna (best I've ever had) made with fresh vegan noodles and a veggie ravioli with cashew vodka sauce. This feast was mostly oil free too!  I never knew little Italy to be all that accessible to vegans but Deanna and our vegan server Abbey made us feel right at home. The only catch is you MUST CALL AHEAD so they can prep these delicious items. While they aren't on the regular menu they are more than happy to make them. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Don't waste your time. Food I'd mediocre at best, environment is depressing, tables are too small for service of four. Highly disappointed with all aspects of our experience."}
{"text":"My wife and I had a wonderful dinner at Anthony's on 12/13/14.  Starting with a delicious calamari that was very tender and a good marinara. My wife had veal parmigiana and a side of fettuccini Alfredo, while I had the cheese tortteloni, not torttelini. Tortteloni is a larger thicker version of tortellini. I had the vodka basil sauce. We finished it off with a pumpkin cheesecake gelato and a tiramisu gelato. The entire meal was delicious and our waiter Andrew gave us great service.  We highly recommend a night out here."}
{"text":"This is the first time I write a yelp review since I don't normally write reviews but I don't want other people to experience what we experienced.   This review is 90% for the restaurant's service.  I went here with my boyfriend and his family for Mother's Day Dinner celebration.  We went here in the past for Valentine's day and had a good experience.  But this time it was beyond terrible service, worst we've ever experienced in any restaurant.   We had a reservation at 8:30PM and showed up at 8:45.The restaurant was not busy at all for a Saturday night compared to other places.  Only a few tables filled.   The lady who later turned out to be our waitress checked me in and said our table was \"being prepared\".  We stood for 10mins until another waiter realized we've been standing there for a while and told her she should have sat us down even though our silverware weren't there yet which was her excuse.   We sat down and no one came to our table for 15mins to get our drink order, not even water.  The waitress finally showed up, took our drink menu.  Brought our drinks 5mins later and we ordered 2 apps to share.  Those showed up 20mins later and we still had no silverware.  So our apps were sitting cold until I can finally flag the waitress down, if I didn't ask, she would have not given us the silverware.  Calamari and stuffed peppers were OK,overpriced for the size.  We ordered our food and those didn't show up for an hour.  An HOUR! And that whole time,our waitress never checked on us or even refiled our empty waters.  I had to again flag her down for that too.  When the food arrived at around 10:30, only one of us had a good chicken marsala.Three of us had the veal and/or chicken parms and they were terrible.  Veal tasted old. And there was so much cheese you can't enjoy/taste anything else.  And don't get me wrong, I love cheese, this was just too much, I had to pick them off. Gelato was good tho.  The bill came out to be over $250 for 5people.  We were the last one at the restaurant, had terrible service, waited a LONG time, food was horrible and overpriced.  NOT COMING BACK. Not recommending this place to anyone. Very unfortunate. We should have just left."}
{"text":"Another AWESOME meal @ Anthony's of Little Italy!  Calamari, bruschetta app, gluten free pizza, chicken parmigiana and grilled chicken Caesar salad. Katie and Sara were so wonderful and helpful!"}
{"text":"We went to Anthonys last night for dinner. We had a great seat outside. I was looking forward to the Lobster ravioli but it was not on the menu.  We ordered wine and calamari.  The calamari was a little undercooked, I ate what wasn't ,it was great. I mentioned it to our great waitress, she comes back and she felt horrible, She said the owner would take it off of our bill and would like to buy us another glass of wine, we're like wow thanks.  I had ordered the Portabella mushroom  ravioli with shrimp, excellent and hot down to the last bite, well it was so much I could not finish. Not having hot food is my pet peeve .. The owner comes out again and felt very bad about the calamari and he offers us homemade gelleto also. How wonderful the gelleto was. We were treated like family and way more. We will be back. Thanks for the great dinner and service.   Bobbie"}
{"text":"Had a group for a last minute dinner in early August.  Great service, very patient with our group.  I had the pizza and it was perfect.  Everyone in our group of six really enjoyed their meal."}
{"text":"Went to Anthony's for the first time tonight. Had no expectations one way or the other. The place is great! The wait staff is friendly and accessible. There was a Sinatra-like karaoke singer who turned out to  to be very talented and We found ourselves in the middle of a large birthday party and felt as if we were at a Tony & Tina Wedding production. Bread was excellent, the dishes (parmesan, picatta) were delicious and bountiful. Save room for the rich gelato (amaretto or watermelon). Well -priced and worth the visit (and a re-visit or two!)."}
{"text":"Outstanding dinner tonight at Anthony's Ristorante.  The food was outstanding and our server very attentive (it was a slow night).  She steered us to their best dishes and was right on each recommendation.  She started us with some bread and homemade garlic, red pepper ans pesto butters.  Loved the red pepper butter.  I started with the Portabello Salad and was not disappointed. The greens were fresh the mushroom properly grilled and the vinaigrette dressing outstanding.  On Joanne's recommendation I tried the Chicken Catchatore. Wow!  Really, really tasty.  To finish we both ordered her recommended Salted Caramel Gelato.  It too was outstanding.  But while we were determine our choice she had us try about 6 different flavors of gelato.  That's service you just don't get at many restaurants.  If you're in Cleveland, find your way to Little Italy and check out Anthony's Risorante.  You will be glad you did."}
{"text":"We are from Cincinnati and hadn't been to Little Italy before but thought it would be a neat place to check out.  We found parking easily and walked up and down the strip.  Out of all the places Anthony's jumped out at us because we could make our own pizza and they had gelato as well.  When we went in the food smelled great so we knew we were in good shape.  The service was excellent and we didn't feel rushd at all.  We ordered the provolone medallions for starters and they were huge and delicious! Then we had our mediium pizza, all peperoni and half mushroom.  It was great!  Finally we had their home made gelato and honestly it was the best gelato I've had since I've been to Florence!  We will definitely be back and would recommend this place to friends."}
{"text":"The food was excellent. So glad we found this place! I wish we had one in Cincinnati!"}
{"text":"Let me just start by saying that this restaurant was a total delight from walking in the front door to staggering out from being so full w fresh gelato in my hands,upon arriving we were greeted and seated in a booth within only a few minutes,My wife and son and I are from Detroit area and wanted to check out Little Italy and from the moment we walked in the smell of the restaurant instantly warmed us on a cold november evening,when we were seated the gentleman showing us to our booth said he was going to be taking care of us and introduced himself as the owner,He began to tell us about the restaurant and how his wife and himself are the owners and she would be preparing all of our food.He also said that 12 yrs ago he went to Italy and brought back his Gelato machine and told us we had to try there Gelato,my wife ordered a glass of cabernet and we had the provolone tenderloins w marinara for an appetizer which was amazing,the bread and homemade butters (3 to choose from) were all delicous.My son ordered a personal pizza,my wife ordered homemade cheese ravioli in a vodka cream sauce and i had the veal parmesan..the veal wasthe best i've ever had and the marinara was outstanding,my wife loved her ravioli and the pizza was great.The owner checked on us frequently and when he seen my wife hadnt drank all her wine he insisted on bringin her another glass he thought she may like better at no charge,all in all a great dining experience for us out of towners and really made us feel at home with the best italian food i've ever had.I highly recommend Anthonys to anyone in the area and will return again any time i'm in the Cleveland area..Little Italy at its best in a comfortable family frind;y atmosphere with great food and service..thx again buddy!!"}
{"text":"This review is regarding the gelato only, because I only ever go here for gelato!  I was gazing out my window at the snow today and glanced over toward Anthony's and felt a pang of sadness. This winter needs to end so that I can enjoy gelato without freezing!   This has got to be my favorite place for gelato. The flavor variety is expansive, but not too much so that I can't make a *fairly* quick decision. The staff is friendly and let you sample things if you ask nicely and are puzzled by any names. Overall, this is just a good, solid place to get gelato! On second thought, perhaps it isn't TOO cold to get some today..."}
{"text":"My family of four thoroughly enjoyed our dinner here tonight.    The kids shared a pizza topped with pepperoni and meatballs.  They were surprised at the taste until we reminded them that the meatballs were homemade and real.  It's was delicious.  We also had chicken marsalla and chicken parmesan.  Almost forgot the appetizer of bruschetta, which was also delicious.  In fact, everything was delicious.  The service was great too.    I highly recommend Anthony's as it's a great value for the ridiculous amount of food served. We're taking home 1/2 the pizza and 1/2 of the chicken Parmesan."}
{"text":"I enjoyed a lazy Sunday afternoon drinking wine and eating a caprese salad on Anthony's sidewalk dining area.  My friend and I both agreed that the dining room feels overdone, so we were happy to sit outside to people watch. I loved the caprese and the glass of Sangiovese. We should have gotten the bottle."}
{"text":"went there for a special occasion recently. Waiters were wonderful, and the owner came by to say hi and make sure we were doing okay, and introduced himself. I told him about or special event, and offered us desert! the Chicken Marsala was okay but the service all around made up for it. I would go back agian!"}
{"text":"Had to come to little Italy when we visited cleveland. Lots of choices on Mayfield but we ended up at anthony's and I'm so glad we did. great service. great food. we had pizza, pasta and salads at our table and we decided we should sample as much as we could amongst ourselves. this is the real deal! great service. sit outside so you can savor the neighborhood because this place is about locals and not tourists."}
{"text":"This has got to be *THE* most depressing interior I've seen in a restaurant in a very, very long time.  I thought I had walked onto the set of, \"Kitchen Nightmares.\"  You practically trip over the gelato cart when you walk in the front door, there is barely anything on the walls, and it's so, so dated.  I think they should convert this place strictly into a carryout place unless you want to sit outside.  It's a shame because the pizza here is pretty damn good."}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant many times since it has opened. I have always had a wonderful experience, but tonight was a totally different experience. I did not see either of the chef/owners tonight so that may have something to do with it.   We were there at 5pm on a Sunday so we figured it was ok to bring our kids. I have seen kids in here frequently so I didn't think twice about it. Upon entering we were not warmly greeted, in fact we were given a dirty look by our waitress and we had to offer up that we had 4 in our party. Service did not get any better as dinner went on. We got pizza, spaghetti and the cheese ravioli. Pizza and spaghetti were just great, cheese ravioli was really bland and over cooked. The sauce on the ravioli was really thick, creamy, bland and congealed. Really disappointing experience! Hope they can step it up for next visit."}
{"text":"This a very solid Italian restaurant with good food and good service!   The decor is obviously cheesy, which I have come to expect of Italian places. A little too Olive Graden with all of the \"Italian\" stuff around you but no big. Lots of bread with yummy flavored butter to start off the meal. The ravioli I had was delicious! There was a lot and I had plenty of leftovers to enjoy later! The waitress was really nice, the restaurant was quiet but not awkwardly so. They also have gelato which I didn't try but probably will next time! Overall, I was pleased and will likely go back again soon."}
{"text":"Food is reasonably priced. Service was unsatisfactory.  My friend didn't receive her side order of spaghetti until we asked for our food to be packed."}
{"text":"I have dined here a couple of times and the food is always incredible. This time I had the blackened salmon and pasta with a creamy pesto sauce and it was delicious."}
{"text":"With a 7 o'clock reservation we were told 6 times in 15 minutes, we will be right with you.   Server was lovely and seemed to realize it was going to be a long evening.  That would have been fine, but the food was very disappointing.  1/2 order of chicken Marsala was a 2 oz piece of chicken served Ina sweet slime sauce with a side of spaghetti.   A Bombay martini was $13.50........more expensive than a fancy restaurant in San Francisco or Honolulu.    Won't return"}
{"text":"I had a really lovely time at Anthony's.  The service was excellent (though it could have been since we were one of only 2 tables occupied when we got there at 6:00 on a Wednesday).  We never had to wait more than a few seconds for a refill, more cheese, napkins, etc.   The menu is pretty vast with a good selection that would make anyone happy.  I am super indecisive so I had the waiter choose between a few options for me, and I ended up with the chicken piccata. It was full of flavor and the chicken was very tender... Would definitely recommend it.  We also had calamari as an appetizer, and it was perfectly cooked... Not rubbery like some places.  For dessert, we had cannoli which were amazing! The crispy shell was obviously fresh and the cream was sweet without being overpowering."}
{"text":"It's a great place for a standard Italian meal. The restaurant was dimly lit & had a wonderful pianist playing throughout the night.  The service was good, just the right amount of attentiveness.  We didn't order dessert because we had a ordered an appetizer, Smoked Gouda flatbread, really good but a large serving for 3 of us, but it came out after the salads.  The Caesar salad was good, just the right amount of garlic!  The Marsala was a bit sweet for my tastes, but the Marinara on the spaghetti was fabulous.  The Caciatore sauce was good, with the right amount of peppers.  It's a good place for a date or celebratory meal, but not for a food out to explore new eateries."}
{"text":"We walked through Little Italy Saturday night looking for a place to eat. Party of 5. We came upon Anthony's. It wasn't our first choice because truthfully it was empty inside which usually isn't a good sign. Upon walking in it wasn't the greatest atmosphere. The whole set-up seems a bit choppy. It needs art on the walls and maybe even some walls taken down to open it up. The tables(that seat more than 4) are actually folding 9ft tables. Kinda tacky. The bathroom- ladies- was so bizarre with the clearly half-assed attempt at putting a wall up between the kitchen and a restroom. The steps into and out of are a hazard.  So why a 5 star rating you ask? The food was THE BEST we've had in little Italy! The bread with 3 different butters were so delicious they'd melt in your mouth. The Chianti was crisp and paired well with all of our meals. The spaghetti and meatballs according to my husband were legendary. My tortallone (sp) which was a special was to die for!  The cheeses and sauce were phenomenal. To end we of course needed their famous gelato. All were good but not great. Speaking of gelato- I'd maybe improve the look of that section too somehow. It looks thrown in there.   Overall I'd return for the food and staff but not because I liked the actual look of things. Hey, at least it was clean!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to Little Italy for Sunday mass with my father since I was a little squirt of 5 years old, now 46, we only come as a family for holidays and of course the Feast.  Today was Father's Day, and in honor of my father, we decided to come to Holy Rosary and have lunch afterwards.  We included, my father, mother, wife, and 2 boys.    I had never eaten at Anthonys but since the place had no one seated at noon, we had hoped for fast service.  After being seated, we asked if they had a lunch menu, after all, it was noon and wanted something light. After speaking to the server, we discovered that they only had a dinner menu and no children's menu. We did ask if they had smaller portion sizes.   The server did come back from the kitchen explaining that they would allow the boys to order half portion sizes.  Odd that this seemed to be uncharted territory for an established restaurant.  I mean, how many parents are willing to pay $20/kid for a la-carte pasta for LUNCH?   The order placed: boys ordered Cavatelli, my father spaghetti, the wife Marsala and my mother and myselfI had taste for a FULL dinner salad (Menu had half $5/Full$9 order).   The time from when we placed our order to serving was nearing 40 minutes and for 3 plates of pasta, one Marsala, and 2 large salads was unacceptable.  We were the only people seated.  The food finally came and it all was presented very nicely which is nothing out of the ordinary for this type of restaurant.  Neither is A La Carte but what was odd was a restaurant that didn't provide a lunch dinning experience.  When it came time for the server to hand my mother and I the plate of fresh greens, I became confused.  The FULL order of salad looked to be a half order on a HUGE plate.  Confused, thinking the server may have only put the order in for a half salad and my mother looking as if a plate of garnish was handed without the entrée , I questioned her.    I said, \"miss, are these full orders of salad\". To her credit, the server did agreed that it did look wrong and went to the chef to see if the order was wrong (4 pieces of Escarole touching end to ends, as if to cover the plate with cheese and 5 halved cheery tomatoes).  Minutes later, she returned.  Before I tell you what she said, I first would like to say that I almost always give the benefit of the doubt for human error. After all, we all make mistakes.  I also understand business and profit, and gradations of restaurant concepts and a satisfied returning customer. First, a customer is most willing to pay for some type of experience (customer service), 2. food flavor- is sometimes secondary or equal to 1., and, 3. Value. Pick 2 and your customers will almost always will return.   Now for what the server said when returning: \"the cook said we ran out of lettuce\".   BREATHLESS and seriously pissed,  I addressed my concerns with the server for wanting to speak to the manager. Here is why and what I believe is more damaging to a restaurant than any of the 3 things mentioned of a satisfied customer.  Dishonesty.  The chef was willing to charge the customer for a half size at a full size price as long as the customer didn't cause question.....on Father's Day.  I am giving the benefit of the doubt to the server as she seemed very apologetic but wondering if she may have been new as a server who has worked there would know that something was wrong.  After all, a server is the most import connection to customer satisfaction. In the end, she DID remove the 2 salads from the bill.   I would rate Anthony's food eaten on a scale from (1-Poor to 5 Excellent-3 Average), a marginal-3.  The sauce was nothing special but good tasting. The salad was flavorful but nothing special and after 5 forks full I was finished, and the Marsala was average but could have been better.  I'm thinking the chicken was frozen at cooking as the Marsala sauce was VERY watered down as well as the pasta not drained correctly (water at the bottom of the plate).        I would not return again nor would I recommend this place."}
{"text":"Poor waitstaff, seemed overwhelmed even though it was almost empty. Received no bread, had to ask for water. Cocktails were weak and much too sweet. The Ravi tasted like a bad Shirley temple and I sent it back. Tomatoes in the caprese salad were not ripe.   Stuffed peppers were good, but served Luke warm and Marina was too sweet, blech. Only saving grace was chicken piccata.   Will not returning, your better off going to Maxis or somewhere else on mayfield."}
{"text":"Visiting a friend in Cleveland and she brought me to little Italy for the first time. Went to Anthony's and this place was amazing. The food was fresh and tasted awesome and the staff brought excellent service. I will eat here again and I highly recommend it to anyone. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Homemade ravioli is amazing! Gelato is fabulous! White linen table cloths. Great place for a nice meal."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! We looked through past reviews and saw many people were recommending the vegan lasagna. We decided to give it a try and were definitely not disappointed! We were down the street and called Deanna and she was able to quickly accommodate us without hesitation.   We were initially indecisive on the menu choices but Deanna, the chef, personally provided her advice on food options. She even made us a modified vegetarian dish based on things we liked and disliked.   Ambiance was perfect. Friendly staff. Prompt service. Would highly recommended. Will be returning soon."}
{"text":"Stopped by on a Saturday evening. Made 7:30 reservation and arrived promptly. I know the waitress was trying hard but the ticket time was an hour. We got the caprese salad and split it. I ordered chicken cacciatore, she ordered chckn piccate. Everything was great. Presentation was great. We got gelato on the house for the wait. Not necessary but it was very good. Also ordered tiramisu. We got tiramisu gelato instead. Restaurant apparently ran out of everything by 7:30 pm on a Saturday. Anthony's was good but not spectacular. I would probably recommend another restaurant in Little Italy on a Saturday."}
{"text":"My first visit to Little Italy in Cleveland - many Italian restaurants to choose from and I was happy to choose Anthony's.  It was an really nice summer evening, so I sat outside.  The restaurant was not as busy as others on Mayfield Road, and I'm not sure why.  The waitress was very attentive, and the food outstanding.  I had the gnocchi's with Marinara and a meatball.  These gnocchi's were really well done (not mushy; nice and firm).  The small ceasar salad (wih anchovies) was also excellent.  For those like me who are out of town, I highly recommend Anthony's!"}
{"text":"The food is good but not exceptional.  The bolognese sauce is a bit heavy handed with tomato paste.  It could be a bit lighter but this is very minor.   The reason for the mediocre review is due to the service and pricing.   The service was incredibly slow even though there were only 2 tables seated and the prices are ridiculous for what it is.   Like I said, the food is good but in no way justifies an $85 price tag for LUNCH."}
{"text":"The Chicken Friuli at lunchtime was very good. The ciabatta on the sandwich was amazing and to our surprise, not prepared in the kitchen. My friend's mushroom ravioli was... just ok. Certainly a restaurant worth more exploration and had it been a warm day, we would have tried the gelato."}
{"text":"Another bad addition to Little Italy.  Anthony's is a newer place in Little Italy.  I thought we'd try it for kicks after having poor food at other Little Italy restaurants (note: Little Italy is for tourists, not for people who know Italian food; there are better options around Cleveland).    Strike 1:  environment This place is rented and the owner has put all of $0 into it.  It has no charm, the a/c doesn't work, and it looks more like a place that could double as a costume store during the Halloween season than a permanent restaurant.   Cheapest chairs and tables a thrift store can offer.  There was NO ONE seated inside due to the lack of a/c and only 4 tables of people outside.  This should have been a sign.  Strike 2: menu Wine here is inexpensive.  A very good value on many of their wines.  The food menu, however, is whacked.  This is supposedly an \"Italian\" restaurant, but the menu does not illustrate this.  No noodle selection (only 2 types of ravioli or spaghetti), and no sauce selection (only marinara or bolognese).  They DO list a vodka-blush sauce on their menu, but as I will get to in this review, they don't have it.  Furthermore, the pizza menu is beyond logic.  For a medium pizza for say, two people, they charge $3-$6 per topping, and most toppings are $6.   So a medium pizza with say, feta and spinach would be around $30.  And remember, this is NOT a nice restaurant.  This is a rented \"space\" that is dishing out food.  So no wonder no other tables were eating pizza either.  Strike 3: food I am Italian.  A mix of Northern and Southern.  I have been cooking authentic, Italian food since I could stand on a stool in front of the stove.  The food here is disgusting, and it is clear from the sparse and bizarre menu that the owners know nothing about Italian food.  I ordered, for lack of other choices, cheese ravioli with  a \"vodka blush sauce\".  Remember what I said earlier?  Well, what came to me was a plate of ravioli drowning in a roux.  Yes, a ROUX!  That's flour and butter to thinken gravy (those of you who don't cook), and there is no reason on this earth that there should be a roux on a plate of pasta, or any other plate.   I sent it back, and the waitress assured me that there was no flour in it.  Really?  So you, Cleveland waitress who pronounces \"marinara\"  as \"mayrinayra\", are going to tell me what is and is not reality?  I said please bring bring me the spaghetti and meatballs instead (sadly, this was the only other choice on the menu).    Strike 4: service The waitress came back 5 minutes later and said that she knows for sure that the sauce doesn't have flour in it.  I replied that whoever told her that lied to her, which she responded was the owner.  I said, \"then the owner lied to you.  You brought me a bright yellow, heavy, pasty mess of flour and butter.  It was not pink, it had no marinara in it, there is NO CONFUSING it (blush sauce is marinara plus a dash of cream and butter to give it a bright pink and light consistency).   The waitress that doesn't know food or how to pronounce \"marinara\" had the audacity to argue with me.  If I weren't with a table of very gentle people, my Italian side would have erupted here.  Instead, I just took a deep breath and waited for the peasant-food spaghetti and meatballs.  By this time everyone else at the table had finished what they wanted to eat of their meals, so we waited.  And we waited.  Finally, I asked that the spaghetti be put in a take out container.   And a 25 minutes later, the spaghetti with meatballs arrived.   I left a 15% tip which was overly generous given the circumstances, but the waitress was very nice up until the sauce incident, and we left, determined never to let anyone come to this shameful attempt at a restaurant again."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the arancini appetizer! The build your own pasta was delicious, I got the ravioli with the spicy arrabiata sauce and it had a lot of kick, just the way I like it! My friend had the chicken Parmesan, which was huge. Our gracious server was happy to make a doggie back for us. Save room for their home made gelato, I had the pumpkin cheesecake gelato and it was rich and creamy. Next time we are in Little Italy, we will stop by again."}
{"text":"It was a beautiful walk through little Italy to get to Anthony's.restaurant and greeted by friendly staff upon arrival. Though the menu was a bit smaller they had some really enticing choices. The pesto butter for our bread hit the spot. We ordered eggplant fries for our appetizer, a chicken and artichoke flatbread and an eight ounce pork rib eye.   The eggplant fries came out hot and ready, a very decent sized portion for an appetizer at a great price. The marinara and garlic/parsley sauces really added to the dish. The flatbread was good and the pork loin was very succulent with a full grilled zuccini. The service here was absolutely amazing. The owner takes interest in his customers and is visible throughout the evening. He even stopped to chat with us for a good ten minutes. If you are looking for a quaint place with large food portions and a fantastic waiter staff I would definitely suggest this gem."}
{"text":"We made our way to Anthony's shortly after a show at Playhouse Square and a brief stroll through Little Italy.  The weather was just lovely so we requested to be seated outside and had a great experience.  Service was attentive, it was fairly quiet and, with a perfect little breeze and good eats, this was the perfect setting for taking in some of the activity around the area.  We started off with a bruschetta appetizer which was loaded with fresh tomato, basil, garlic, romano and red onion yummy-ness with a balsamic reduction drizzled over the platter.    The bread came out with three different types of butter - pesto, regular (I think), and red pepper - all delicious with the crusty Italian bread.   I ordered a red wine, the Feudo d'Elimi Nero D'Avola, and really enjoyed its dryness and subtle flavor which complemented my meal well. I ordered the veal parmesan and the fella ordered the homemade cheese ravioli with bolognese instead of the blush sauce.  We were both please with our meals - I loved the tenderness of the veal with the tart marinara and he remarked that the bolognese tasted much like his mother's, a recipe passed down in his family.  You could really tell the ravioli was fresh and homemade, cooked perfectly with a generous ricotta filling.   We skipped dessert to opt for some \"to-go\" cannolis from Presti's but with all the good things I've read about their gelatto I'll plan to come back for that another time!"}
{"text":"I ate here with my 11 year old daughter.  The food was delicious.  We had a side salad, fried motzerella and a pizza with pepperoni and meatballs.  Unfortunately, we did not have room for dessert so we will have to come back.  Also there was so much to choose from.  I'd like to come back and try something else on the menu.  The service was very good."}
{"text":"A great spot for date night! We loved sitting outside on the high top table. The food was excellent- my boyfriend has gnocchi pesto and I had the blush angel hair. We both had to stop ourselves from eating the whole thing it was so good! We definitely will return here again."}
{"text":"I can't believe I have never been here before!!! The food was out of this world! The gnocchi in basil vodka sauce was five stars! My boyfriend had the chicken piccata and it was outstanding as well!  The loss of one star was because our waitress was awful!! She was probably the worst waitress I have ever had! But I will be back and avoid being sat in this woman's section!!"}
{"text":"I liked going to Anthony's in Little Italy. It was a nice old fashioned Cleveland Italian Deli. They had a hot table with half a dozen pasta dishes on one side and on the other there was shelves with pasta, jars of olives etc. and bottles of wine for sale.  But alas, Anthony's has gone upscale. It's no longer a deli with good wholesome food, it's morphed into a real restaurant. The food's still good, maybe even better than before, but the memory of what was still lingers on.  There are at least a dozen good restaurants in Little Italy, but there was only one Anthony's and now it is, in essence, gone. Booo"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch. Everything was perfect. They have a light touch with everything - sometimes Italian food can be heavy and overdone. Everyone's meal was \"just right.\" The fried calamari is some of the best that I've had. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Any traditional Italian restaurant that will go out of their way to make a special vegan meal gets 5 stars from me.   I was looking for a new place to check out in Little Italy and noticed Adam R.'s review that mentioned vegan options at Anthony's. You have to call or make a note in your reservation, but that's no big deal.  The night before my dinner, the manager called me to discuss my dinner options. I was offered stuffed peppers, spaghetti and meatballs, or lasagna. I could be Garfield the cat when it comes to lasagna, so you know what I picked.  When I arrived the next night and checked in with the hostess, they noted that I was the vegan and a first time diner and made sure to give me a very warm welcome.   We started off our meal with cheeseless bruschetta and my fiance had an order of arancini balls. He gobbled them up, so they must have been good. I don't think you can every really go wrong with bruschetta, so I enjoyed my appetizer. And then our entrees came out. My fiance had some sort of chicken and I had some of the best vegan lasagna (besides my own recipe, of course) that I've ever eaten. It was made with seitan, a meat substitute, a flavorful sauce, and a little bit of Daiya, a vegan cheese. It was really delicious.   My server told me that the lasagna is good but I need to go back and check out the vegan meatballs. If they're half as good as the lasagna, I can't wait!  Also important to note, there are gluten free options. Again, it helps to call ahead or make a note in your reservation, but kudos to the owner and chef for accomodating special dietary needs."}
{"text":"So, where do I start....  The food was good.   That's a start and that's the end.   So, I've been to most other restaurants in Little Italy and I like most and love some.  I hadn't, until today, experienced a restaurant in Little Italy that I would not try again.  But now we have a winner.  I will never go back here.  The service was horrendous.  Not just bad....horrendous.  As in non-existent.  It took us one and a Half hours to get our food.  These were all simple dishes, such as spaghetti and meatballs, cavatelli, etc.   Our waitress was no where to be seen, most of the night.  But, terrible as she was, I can't blame her.  It appears to me that the kitchen staff didn't show up.  If they aren't doing their jobs, no food goes out and the people walk away upset...as we did.   Then when we got the $100 bill for this decent food ( four plates of pasta, no alcohol), we were amazed.  A place with only decent food, no apparent kitchen staff, crappy service, and a somewhat unclean interior (i didnt mention there were cobwebs in our booth) shouldn't cost this much.   Amazing.  We should have just walked out right when we were being ignored...no one would have noticed.   We would have been happier, the kitchen staff (if they in fact exist) would have had less work to do, the waitress would also have had less work to do.... Everyone would have been happier....  I'd have walked across the street eaten better food from a more pleasant establishment and had a better night.  So, the title of this review should be Anthony's...I wouldn't cross the street for it."}
{"text":"We went there last Friday evening with a party of eight. We were seated right away. I had the 4 cheese ravioli in a vodka sauce. Excellent. Our server, David, was very good. This restaurant will become a favorite!"}
{"text":"This is a tale of two restaurants. As one might when celebrating a birthday, I ate out twice in one day. At lunch, the food was delicious and the service was impeccable, but not at all stuffy.  Dinner was another story. While Anthony's had promise, my hopes that we would be the exception to what seems to be their rule of slow service were quickly dashed - there were several unexplained 20 minute lulls in our meal, where no staff were standing around but nothing was happening.   For the same price at lunch, we left feeling like it was a special meal that was a good value. Dinner at Anthony's left me wishing I had taken the cautions regarding slow service in other reviews more seriously.  Given the number of restaurants in Little Italy, I'm surprised they're not forced to improve; you can't make a living on good spaghetti and meatballs alone."}
{"text":"My wish was Anthony's command.  I had just finished a huge, filling meal at a restaurant in Lakewood when I declared, \"I would really love some good gelato,\" and - lo and behold - I turned around to see Anthony's with gelato right in the window.  Begin challenge of finding parking in Little Italy (a spot magically appeared right in front Anthony's right after I said I wanted the gelato - cue heavenly choir), and the gelato adventure began.    I just wanted a little something sweet, so I chose to sample both the pistachio (yum) and strataciela (also yum).  I couldn't decide between the two, so my server graciously offered to give me a little bit of each in a small cup.  It was heaven!  I love the consistency of gelato so much more than ice cream, and each scoop swelled with sweet flavor.    Only downsides to the place were a) price ($4 for a tiny cup?) and b) parking -- although I got lucky, I don't know how often I will be able to scratch my itch for gelato with the traffic being what it is on that part of Mayfield Rd.  In any case, this place hit the spot for me today when I had my craving!"}
{"text":"i wanted to make number 40 special, and I cannot think of a better place than Anthony's.  Going to Anthony's for the decor is like going to a coney island and ordering the salad.   I used to go to Cleveland on a regular basis, like at least once a week. Being that I was always paid to go, I didn't mind it was Cleveland. Seriously, I grew to love Cleveland almost as I love Detroit. I even deserted the LIons in favor of the Browns.  On one hot summer day, coming back from Akron, I stumbled upon this little gold mine of a restaurant. I got the lasagna and from that day forward I was hooked. The sauce was divine, as were the tender noodles and the meat was as flavorful as I have ever tasted.   I never knew how good Cleveland Italian food could be. I later learned that Cleveland is the best place in this country outside of Italy itself for the cuisine. I mean, you're gonna look long and hard for a bad meal in this city.  I have never told anyone about Anthony's because I wanted to keep this secret to myself. But, go, eat and enjoy. The decor may be dated, but who cares? They could cook in a tent and make this caliber of food. It is simply the best. Now if the Browns could play football like Anthony's cooks, they would be undefeated for the rest of eternity. OK, so we cant have it all. Who does?"}
{"text":"Probably the best Italian meal I've ever had! I didn't have any idea where to go for dinner while I was visiting Cleveland, but I heard that all the Italian restaurants were wonderful in Little Italy.   The first one we saw was Anthony's. We glanced at the menu and decided it looked like the kind of food we wanted, so we stayed. I am so glad we did!  I had the Veal Parmesan and Meat Ravioli and both were just wonderful! I also had the house salad (with dried cranberries) with their homemade vinegarette dressing, and also the Bruschetta appetizer. Everything was very very good!   Beautiful atmosphere and excellent, friendly service.   I'm looking forward to going back! : )"}
{"text":"I've only been to this place once but it left a great impression on me. I will definitely come back to this place.  First, their entrees were delicious. We tried the lobster ravioli and chicken picatta. Both were great.  Second, the service. The lady waiting our table was the one of the nicest and most helpful people I've seen in a restaurant in a long time.  Third, gelatto."}
{"text":"My most favorite dining out experience ever was at Anthony's this summer for a date night!  From the moment we walked in, we were impressed with the friendliness of the staff.  We had reservations and we were seated immediately upon entering.  They asked when the reservations were made if we had preferred seating which is very generous, and our candlelit table was waiting for us.  The walls were painted beautifully and we admired the art throughout our entire dinner.  Our waitress, Sarah, arrived immediately and we had not had an opportunity to look at the wine menu and she recommended her favorite red so we each had a glass.  We loved the wine and wanted to try more throughout our dining experience and after trying three kinds, we both agreed that her wine was by far the best!  I have very severe food allergies and Sarah was more than happy to accommodate my requests, and wrote a list of all my allergies to give to the chef.  She arrived with fresh salads and informed me that the salad was specially made in a gluten free room by the owner of the restaurant.  That was extremely impressive!  Our meals were amazing, I ordered the blackened salmon with zucchini and it was phenomenal!  My boyfriend enjoyed the best chicken parmesan he's had and we were so impressed with the food and that the owner was so amazing and prepared and cooked our food specially for us!  We asked to speak with her to compliment her and she personally came to our table!  Her name is Deanna Anthony and she is the most amazing cook and her restaurant is the best!  She offered me something that I've never been offered before - she asked for me to call ahead when I am coming in next and let her know my allergies and she would specially prepare grain free pasta!  I have allergies to many things and she said that she would use new pans that never touched food containing my allergies!  What a wonderful lady, and WOWWWW was her cooking AMAZING!  We were so very blessed to enjoy our experience while she was there, because she made our night unforgettable!  Our server, Sarah, continued to serve us with a level of excellence!  She brought us 3 cups of coffee and 3 cups of tea and was humble and kind throughout our entire meal!  The host and the entire wait staff were all very kind and friendly to us as well!  We will be back soon, it was an amazing experience and we enjoyed everything!  Thank you Deanna, God bless you`"}
{"text":"We came in as part of our Little Italy food tour and the meatballs we had as our course here were amazing! My husband is vegetarian and his veg meatballs were also out of this world (the best he has had so far in Cleveland). We will definitely be coming back for a full meal!"}
{"text":"Great service and great food. First time visitors, we relied on Yelp to ID a Cleveland favorite. We will make this a regular stop!"}
{"text":"Had a great lunch. Owner came by to explain vegan options. Food and service excellent.  Great place foe relaxing meal. Sauce is very tasty ans pizza dough nice consistency."}
{"text":"Phenomenal. My wife and I were in town and saw that Anthony's was well reviewed. We were showed to our seats by Kimberly the manager who walked us through the menus and let us know her favorite dishes. My wife went with the pasta with blackened salmon and creamy pesto. I went with the chicken florentine. Both of us found the food to be incredible. So fresh and light. A wonderful experience. We travel to Cleveland every couple months and will return without a doubt."}
