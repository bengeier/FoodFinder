{"text":"Food is ok... but the service..... What service... either they are very blunt... either they don't speak french.... and they answer your in another language then yours.... or it is soooo cold in the restaurant...."}
{"text":"Very tasty food! I got the ginger shrimps. 8 big prawns. Plenty and delicious. Service was a tad slow but they were busy. Would go back. Price is on the Hugh side ($20/plate)"}
{"text":"La bouffe est bonne, le service est bon. On a eu à changer 2-3 fois notre réservation et ils ont été très accommodants! :)"}
{"text":"Stopped by here randomly to grab a quick bite, ended up splitting a $19 chicken and crispy noodle dish (a bit expensive if you ask me for the type of food).

The dish was very bland and tasted like almost everything was boiled down.  The \"crispy\" noodled ended up being soggy in the veggie broth that resulted from everything on the dish.

My date and I ended up adding salt and pepper to the chicken and veggies just to give it some taste."}
