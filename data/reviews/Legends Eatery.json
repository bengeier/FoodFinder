{"text":"Update:  Chef Dan read my review (below) and was kind enough to refund the meal. As stated in my original review I should have sent the meal back right away, so that part is on me. Great quality customer service.   When I go which is probably about a half-dozen times a year for the past several years.  I usually just order the Beans and Greens.  This past Friday evening I did something different, I ordered the special which sounded divine.  Blackened ahi tuna with two different kinds of ravioli asparagus and mushrooms topped with artichoke hearts covered with a cream sauce.  Well when the dish arrived I thought it was my dinner companion's meal because all I saw at first was the ravioli.  My friend was confused as well because she thought the fish, the tuna was replaced with salmon, was an unripe tomato.  It was in fact the smallest piece of salmon I had ever been served in a restaurant barring a piece of salmon sushi.  My friend joked that maybe because I was wearing a kimono jacket they thought I want a bonsai salmon.  Now I blame myself for not sending it back, this is what I should have done.  Now it gets worse.  The bill comes, my dish was $36.  Sticker shock and disappointment to say the least.  Given that the entrees at Legend's are in the $18-25 range I thought that the high-end of that range would be the price of this special.  Ah well Legend's if I do return I will go back to the Beans and Greens.  If you go and are tempted to order the special, ask the price."}
{"text":"During our recent visit to Pittsburgh, I really wanted to try this place again.  Our first visit last year was great and there were more items on the menu I wanted to try.  It did not disappoint!  We had Italian Wedding soup that was wonderful and my wife just had to try to re-create this when we got home.  Their greens and beans is a special treat, with lots of flavor -- an excellent side dish for my main dish, spaghetti and meatballs. Now I would not usually order this at most \"Italian\" restaurants, but Chef Dan does an excellent job with perfectly cooked pasta, a fresh marinara sauce, and a huge, tasty meatball.  And to wrap up, I just HAD to have the caramel apple pie a-la-mode.  I don't normally have dessert, but I've SEEN and HAD this pie before.  Yummy!  The warm homestyle atmosphere does not prevent me from feeling \"special\" when I dine here. The staff treated me like family and I'll be visiting again!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh.  The food is consistently amazing (I highly recommend the blackened shrimp pasta), the ambiance is great for a casual or more formal gathering, and the service is tremendous.  The prices are also very reasonable.  I literally crave the food from Legends....you must check this place out!"}
{"text":"We greatly enjoyed our date night dinner here! Everything we tried was delicious. Only leaving off a star because the dining experience wasn't very smooth. The wait staff just seemed a bit stretched.  We'll definitely be going back though!"}
{"text":"FANTASTIC CHEFS ALWAYS, service is not as good as the food... still what a wonderful surprise!"}
{"text":"I happened to be waiting on my bus and decided to grab something to eat in the area. I'm originally from the Northisde but have yet to try some of the smaller restaurants mainly because I just didn't know of them. I had a client ask me if I tried this place and she went on about how good it was. I loved it although it's a small menu, everything tasted great! Service was great and they are nice and friendly from the moment I walked in the door. They also have you homemade fudge after your meal. I ate alone but still had a good experience  not to noisy at all. Pretty clean and a nice style to the restaurant. I had the chicken pestnini (spell check) which was ok but not much flavor to me. But I loved the turkey panini."}
{"text":"Food: menu will appeal to vegetarians and non-vegetarians, with daily dinner specials, separate lunch (sandwiches) and dinner (entrees) menus, both soups were vegetarian (according to the waitress, never heard of vegetarian minestrone before), I ordered penne with multiple veggies and a white wine sauce, it was above average but not great, soup was good, a bowl of bread sticks was on the table and replaced regularly, salad was average size and quality  Price: dinners range from $12-18 with most toward the higher end of that range, not expensive, but the quality of the food probably deserves the lower end of that scale  Drinks: BYOB  Atmosphere: sports bar-family restaurant type setting, with pictures of athletes all over the wall, but better than sports bar quality food and service  Service: waitress refilled water many times, was on the ball and timely, answered all questions about the menu  (+): good service, reasonable prices, good but not great food  (-): nothing wrong with Legends, but also nothing spectacular  Would I go back again? I wouldn't drive to the North Side to eat here, but if I was in the North Side, it would be at the top of the list, particularly if friends/family were at AGH (directly across the street)."}
{"text":"Small, overcrowded, unfriendly staff.  The food is okay - typical Italian fair that could be better seasoned.   There are much better options nearby, but in a pinch, it's decent."}
{"text":"A cute neighborhood find!  Food is delicious and the BYOB (corkage is minimal, but waived on Wednesday when we were lucky enough to be there) is plus.  The menu, while not extensive, has something that will appeal to everyone.  We didn't have room for dessert, but they looked amazing and were huge!  The ambiance is minimal, but because of the great food and very reasonable prices, it was packed! Seriously, an appetizer, 2 entrees with salads and bread, plus our the wine we brought - all for under $50!  Hard to beat that in any other city!  Definitely worth a visit if you are in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"Fantastic restaurant. Close seating, must make reservations because it fills up. BYOB. And my meal was delicious. Maybe it was the atmosphere because it was an anniversary dinner for my husband and i, but I adored this place."}
{"text":"I took my parents here for lunch yesterday, so I could check it out for my sister.  We are going to make reservations to have dinner to honor her later in August at Legends.  We all enjoyed our lunches.  The staff was great.  I'd make reservations on a weekend night.  The place is small, I think I counted 13 tables.  There is outdoor seating as well."}
{"text":"Very good home style Italian... Very friendly staff. You should bring a bottle of red to go with your dinner... Worth it!"}
{"text":"Great experience! Service was great and very friendly. Food was phenomenal; my highest praises to the chef and staff! I will definitely be returning and checking out their other menu options and specials. I also loved that it was BYOB..Best kept secret in Pittsburgh, and I would recommend it to everyone!"}
{"text":"First time here. My parents raved about this place and how great the spots are.   We arrived at 6:45 in a sat night and were promptly seated at our table.  We ordered an app and unfortunately this is where our problems began. They brought mussels instead of our mozzarella sticks. But this was quickly corrected.   They were fair. We had the Brussel sprouts which were under cooked and did not have any Parmesan cheese on them. Plus they were mixed in with large random pieces of lettuce. So odd!   I was actually looking forward to the special. Ribeye topped with shrimp. But unfortunately they had already sold out of the special. Amazing since it was so early on in the night and nothing else in the menu looked good. It was all traditional oily foods.   Plus who can't make a veal or chick parm. It's the easiest thing to make.   My parents had the spots and the portion was sooooo small and came on an plate all by itself. I give them a 1 for presentation.   The best part of the meal was the wine. Oh yeah it was byob. So I guess I did a good job at picking out the wine. Haha.   Service was nice and friendly. And she did apologize multiple times about the food. But did nothing to make up for it.   Won't be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"I go to this place about once a month for lunch and I am consistently impressed with the quality of my meals and the service. It seems like an unassuming cafe, but the food is way above average and the waitstaff is always friendly and engaging.  Usually, I will get one of their sandwiches and I am especially impressed with their chicken parmesan panini. It's obvious that the ingredients are fresh and the bread is homemade. It's the kind of meal I would expect in an New York bistro, but it is right here in Pittsburgh.   Overall, this is a great restaurant if you like fresh ingredients and good Italian food. Also, the conversation with the waitstaff is always so fun!"}
{"text":"We made reservations for my mother's birthday for 14. No one in my family had ever been to the restaurant; we used yelp and trip advisor to find it.  They were ready for us and everything was fabulous.    I had spaghetti and meatball.  The pasta was perfectly done. The kitchen was great.  Everyone got their meals almost at the same time (which is very hard for a small restaurant with a big group).  The people were professional and friendly.  The BYOB allowed us to have wine that suited everyone's taste.  They did the pasta and non-pasta dishes very well.    This small restaurant is a gem in an up and coming neighborhood.  We walked from the Priory Hotel on a beautiful March evening."}
{"text":"Watch out for the cold table in the pit In spite of requesting a move, we were told all tables were booked.Of course that was not true. Prices were inflated for  a limited valentines Day Menu. I have been there many times in past, and raved about it to friends. Never again, they are off my list."}
{"text":"Very nice people. The food looks great and tastes good as well. Short lunch time menu. I enjoyed the special which was a pulled pork taco. Others at the table had pasta and they enjoyed it. One of the passes was a bit spicy hot. But if you like spicy as I do it was good."}
{"text":"Our first dining experience here caught a bad night at the restaurant. This time, our night out was very enjoyable. Reservations worked. Service was friendly. We weren't rushed out. Food was plentiful and very good. And bonus, Wednesday night is free corkage night. I will be back."}
{"text":"This was the worst chicken and pasta I have ever eaten in my life. Chicken was not cooked well, tasteless, tomato source was not fresh, it was a can tomato and you can still taste the feeling of the canned food. Pasta is an insult. The soup was horrible, just vegetables floating in water. I don't know why or how it gets the name as legend but a legend for being the worst. Plus I paid $23. I was hungry and had to eat so that I stayed but at another time I would definetely return. The inly good rhing was bread. The waitress, old one, was annoying.  Cry over my money."}
{"text":"We enjoyed dinner at legends tonight it was a great experience the food was outstanding,the waitress made us feel at home.  We definitely will be back the prices were also reasonable"}
{"text":"Been there three times and each time it got better.  Most recent dinner was with a party of 14.  A large crowd for a smal place but they made it work.  Everyone was extremely pleased with their meal.  The lobster ravioli & salmon specials were top notch.  The service was even better than the food if that is possible.  Best restaurant in the burgh & it's BYOB to boot.  Make sure you have reservations."}
{"text":"Been here a few times.  Decent place that always rates 3-4 stars"}
{"text":"Very good food, very good. It's very small inside and kind of uncomfortable to maneuver - especially for someone with a disability like me.  If you're in a wheelchair, don't even think about going here. If you use a cane or walker, you should seriously consider going elsewhere. I don't need an assistive device at the moment but it was still really uncomfortable for me to enter and then move around in there.  To all disabled people - go somewhere else.   Food is awesome though. So good. I took my mom there last weekend for her birthday. It was sooo good. The vodka sauce dishes are great. The desserts are HUGE. I mean HUGE. And so good. Get the homemade cannoli.  Just get it."}
{"text":"Good food, nothing too \"amazing\", a bit overpriced for what they offer, but a good little quaint place to eat. Salad looked very nice, although they were stingy on the dressing, also only have 2 kind of dressings; Balsamic and ranch. Soups could have been a bit more full in the cups. I had the fettuccine Alfredo, and it was in all honesty an average meal of fettuccine, wasn't too impressed with it. But hey, if you're looking to try something new and don't mind spending a few extra bucks, give it a try!"}
{"text":"Legends is a great place to go for a night out with your significant other, or a few close friends. The homey/intimate environment makes you feel like you are in your parents living room waiting for a home cooked meal from your mom.   Of the 4 times I've been here, I don't have any complaints. The staff is friendly and accommodating. I'm usually not a fan of getting chicken when I dine out, but the Chicken Romano and Chicken Cacciatore are on point. Chef Dan's greens and beans are delicious as well, and I can't complain about the warm focaccia bread they bring out before dinner.  It is BYOB, so make sure you bring your own bottle if wine. There is a small corkage fee, usually around $4 a person.   They have some sort of special going on every night during the week. Monday is couples night which is dinner for 2 for $30, Tuesday is .99 cent greens and beans with an entree, Wednesday there is no corkage fee, and Thursday is ladies night. Be sure to make a reservation if you can, weekends fill up fast.  All in all one of my favorite dining spots on the North Side for a special occasion."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood italian.  Really excellent homecooked, delicious fare.  Tiny, cozy place.  Love the complementary homemade fudge - a nice touch."}
{"text":"I really like this place, it is just that simple.  There seem to be some mixed reviews on Yelp about the food or the service but our experience was great.  The service was a little slow on some things like refilling our water glasses or taking our orders but nothing to complain about as they were super busy.  We enjoyed the extra time to talk and catch up with our dinner friends.  Once the food orders were taken, the food came out quickly and correctly.  Plus it was delicious.  We had 4 people total.  We split 2 appetizers, a cheese and charcuterie board special and the Norma.  Both were good, not great but solid enough.  The main dishes were tremendous.  Two folks got a salmon and shrimp ravioli special which they raved about (and I tried and agreed).  One got a blackened shrimp special and I got the Mussels Bianco but chose the red sauce and paid the up charge for the Hell sauce.  I dreamed about it the next day, it was that good.  We topped off the evening with some canoli's.  Chef Dan's wife makes most of the desserts (except the canoli's we found out later).  Chef Dan even stopped by at the end of the night.  Lastly, a great BYOB with a reasonable corkage fee and policy and good stemware.  Worth the visit.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Sat at the 2 seats right at the bar once you open the door.   Server was fast, informative, and always quick for a re-fill.  Got the ravioli and chicken special at the waitresses recommendation and it was unreal. Some of the best Italian food i've ever had, disappointed I waited this long to try Legends."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times and it is always great! Great food and great service. I am going to a rehearsal dinner here soon and I cannot wait!"}
{"text":"Decided to hit this place before hitting on 12 while the dealer shows a 9 at the Rivers.   We didn't have a reservation but the server seated us anyways (we had to be done by 7).  It is BYOB but they deal you a $4 corkage fee per person drinking.  The bread sticks were fresh and warm and were the perfect accompaniment to the delicious soup du jour, potato soup.  The side salad that comes with the meal would make the hall of fame for any side salad league.  It came with olives, Gorgonzola, julienned carrots and other veggies.  I had the pork tenderloin with veggies and mashed potatoes.   The tenderloin was perfectly cooked and the mashed potatoes were like having two aces in the hole.   It would be tough to find a better waitstaff.   Plates disappeared, water was filled, and I never knew they were there.  If your looking for a place to try before going to the casino or bucco game this is a sure bet, just call ahead for reservations.  They do have outdoor seating but the views wont show up on any postcard.  PS The 7:00 reservation called to say they were going to be late so we were allowed to relax at the table till 7:30."}
{"text":"I stopped here after a long day of house hunting. It's a small place but has a pretty nice family like feeling to it. I could tell there are alot of regulars that come here because there was alot of first name basis going on.   They bring out bread with this delicious olive oil and seasoning to start you off. The salads were pretty good from what I remember. The entrees were completely satisfying. I got the chicken fettucine alfredo and it was pretty good but nothing to write home about. The legends is not the best Italian food I've ever had but it was damn good. The dessert was amazing, all seemed home made and we even got some complimentary fudge after our meal! If you are in the area it is definitely the best Italian food around but like I said it's not the best ever. 4 stars for legends!"}
{"text":"I love Legends!  My friends and I frequent there often!  The food and service is always wonderful! Love that it's BYOB! My favorite is their spinach ravioli! I live in the War Streets so it's so convenient!  My 2 friends are having their rehearsal dinner here and I know we won't be disappointed! Thank you Legends!"}
{"text":"I was out and about on a Saturday afternoon with a good friend and we were in the north side area and he suggested that we eat at \"Legends of the North Side\" since he heard it was good.  We walked into the door and there was a woman standing near the door and she shot us a look of surprise (or frustration) and asked if we had a reservation? Well that wasn't the greeting I was expecting and was surprised at this question since the place was empty but within a half hour I totally understood why.  This small but quaint restaurant filled up very fast.  This establishment is just lovely and was clean and was decorated for the holiday season.  It was cozy.   The menu was small but had something for everyone and the prices weren't too bad but It might be a little pricey if you are on a budget but it's worth it trust me.     The service was excellent.. we received beverages and bread within a moments time.  Our bread basket never remained empty either.  We ordered the \"beans and greens\" as an appetizer and it was delicious. My Italian Mother makes this dish all the time and it was \"almost\" as good as hers - which is saying a lot.      I had penne pasta with sausage, roasted red peppers, olives and artichokes.   It was very tasty but was a bit salty for my taste (think it was the olives) but still delicious.  My friend ordered the Walleye and was very pleased.  The tossed salad that came with my entree was just the right size and everything was fresh. Fresh greens and was accompanied by carrots, red onions, feta, cherry tomatoes and olives.   By the time we were ready to leave there wasn't an empty table in the place.   The restaurant is located on the corner at a very convenient location in North side with parking available on the street right outside the restaurant. Getting back on 279 was a snitch.   The restroom doors were so festive and unique that I couldn't resist taking a picture !!   The restrooms were also clean too.  I love restaurants that aren't \"chains\" and have their own flair .. and this establishment has that!   I am very happy we decided to have dinner at Legends of the North Shore and will no doubt be visiting again ...   Bravo !"}
{"text":"We do not often get back to my home town of Pittsburgh, PA so this trip was a real treat with our visit to Legends of the North Shore - a highfaluitn name for sure as it is just the plain old North Side when I was growing up.  Down home and delicious is how I would describe Legends.  Cramped and not pretentious - it's all about the food which is delicious for sure.  This will be a regular stop whenever we are in the burg for sure.  Don't let the area scare you away - well worth the trip and the hassle of finding a parking space that is not restricted.  Just go there and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Will never return to this place. Expensive and rude. Was asked to leave during dessert because there were other parties waiting that had reservations.  I had dinner there with a couple of business associates, while we were celebrating her birthday. Ordered some fish which in my opinion was very overpriced for the portion size. It was a tasty meal but I have had much better. Word has it that the Gnocchi is frozen, not homemade.  Our table was right next to the radiator and it was so hot in there that it felt like we were sitting in a sauna. The waitress graciously adjusted the temperature, though it was still really uncomfortable.  The most ridiculous part though, was being asked to leave shortly after the waitress brought us our dessert. We were informed by a different waitress that other parties were waiting and that had reservations. We were right in the middle of dessert when we were notified. Not once during the phone conversation was I notified that there was a time limit on our dinner reservation. This was completely embarrassing to me, as I was the one who recommended the place. Oh, and the place charges a corking fee to cork our own wine (Its BYOB).  Dinner for 3 people was $110 before tip and this was with no appetizers or alcoholic drinks since we brought our own. Not in all my years of dining have I ever been asked to leave a restaurant. We were polite and not belligerent in any way.. Being asked to leave is completely unacceptable. The restaurant should give a disclaimer to people during the reservation process if they want to put a time limit on their dining experience. This place came highly recommended but I am completely perplexed as to why it has good reviews. If I could give it my own star rating it would be a big FAT ZERO."}
{"text":"I became a regular at this very cool place......if only for a week.   I was in town due to a family member's hospitalization and discovered this place. The food is great, nice atmosphere, and amazing staff.  I tried the antipasto the first day, and loved it.  Warm focaccia bread with dipping oil was brought to the table.  Tasty!!!!! The next day I had the spinach ravioli, and that's what I stuck with the remainder of the week.  The sauce is really one of the better ones I've had.  I loved it.  I tried the cannoli, caramel butter pecan cake, and chocolate layer cake.  All amazing, and all huge!  It gets crazier.  They walk around offering pieces of fudge after your meal.  It was really a calm and comforting break for me in the middle of some very stressful days.  Shout out to Janet who works there and is awesome.  I'm from the area, but currently live in TN.  I'll make sure to stop by next time I'm home for a visit."}
{"text":"I was in town, visiting my brother who was at Allegheny General in the Neuro ICU. My brother's friend Anthony \"AP\" recommend Legends for dinner. I took my parents and godparents over for dinner after hospital visiting hours ended. I must say, this was THE BEST Italian food I have ever had, in my entire life (I'm 52). We needed this food and togetherness for this time in our lives. Thank you! I had the spinach ravioli, and I'm still thinking about the flavors three weeks later, back home in Long Beach, CA! I can't recall dreaming about food and flavors, but Legends changed all that for me!"}
{"text":"So I was super skeptical of Legends of the North Shore.  My buddies from work have gone dozens of times and I've always refused thinking that I'd probably be stuck eating a salad if I went.  Well... I was wrong.  Legends has gluten free pasta available!    The interior is rather small and it gets really busy; however, this does not influence the service.  Our main waitress was a delight.  She made small talk AND she really understood what it means to be gluten free.  She was on it!  I love being able to talk to a waitress that really knows her stuff and that is exactly what I got.  I ended up getting the gluten free pasta with vodka sauce (and prosciutto) and a side salad.  Let me just say, the vodka sauce is some of the best sauce I have EVER had and the pasta was cooked perfectly( which as you guys know is a difficult ask).  I loved it and am ashamed that I stayed away so long.    Definitely give it a try :D"}
{"text":"I've eat'n here a few times over the last couple of years and have been very pleased with both the food and service every time.  I most recently was there on this past Saturday, which I don't recommend showing up on a Saturday without reservations,  we got the last two seats at the bar and were lucky to get those.  We ordered the pasta special and it was amazing.  It was shrimp and crab ravioli in a white wine sauce, cooked with asparagus, roasted yellow peppers, and mushrooms.  It was probably the best ravioli I ever had.  It was topped with four huge pieces of shrimp cooked to perfection.  Most meals come with either soup or salad, either is guaranteed to be delicious, and some bread served with olive oil for dipping.  Some other things I've had that I really enjoyed were the spaghetti and meatball, the hot anti-pasta, and their fudge.  Everything has a very home cooked feel to it, better than mom used to make.  They also use the freshest of ingredients, the secret to any good Italian meal.  The service here is very good too, and very friendly.  If you want a good home cooked Italian meal and warm, friendly atmosphere, this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch and was greeted by great-looking focaccia coming out of the oven. Based on that view, I decided to have the eggplant foccacia. It came with homemade Italian wedding soup, which was good with fresh veggies.  It also came with delicious bread and seasoned oil for dipping-- excellent!  The eggplant was good, but honestly, the sun dried tomato and olive tapenade did not enhance the sandwich. It would have rocked with a homemade marinara instead.   The waitress was friendly in a casual way, and the atmosphere was warm and contemporary.  I will try something else next time, as it is worth a return visit!"}
{"text":"Make reservations,byob,the food is awesome,the menu is always fresh,love the personal feel,great desserts,always a great meal"}
{"text":"OK so another winner in this neighborhood besides Nicky's.  The Penna Parma was outstanding and the Parm crusted salmon over whole wheat artichoke ravioli with a white basil sauce on special tonight was a great combo and wonderfully executed.  Katie our server was professional AND personable and only added to our outstanding meal.....then there were the Pittsbugh natives seated nearby who were friendly and delightful to visit with.   WOW what a place.  The only downside is that its a little tight inside and a little loud but don't let that stop you!  Well worth the trip!"}
{"text":"Very cool place to have a nice dinner.  I always go for the mussels-delicious!  Pasta is always fresh and tasty, too.  Friendly wait staff.  This would be a five-star if they were able to serve adult beverages."}
{"text":"Dealing with a situation where a family member has spent time at AGH - needing to have a meal, we saw Legends and decided to try - Oh my!!!!!! Not only was the staff amazing - the food was delicious- we have gone each day (except today - closed Sunday's )  In the midst of such a trying storm, we were so blessed to find the wonderful place - thank you all so much !!!!!!"}
{"text":"So if a restaurant is BYOB it has an instant star in my opinion even it is has a weird strip club-esque name (Legends, though? Come on guys).   So one of friends and fellow yelper lives in the hood so we decided to bundle-up, wine-up on a snowy friday night and head for Legends. The interior was more retro than I was expecting, not extremely cozy.  The menu is pretty standard with some rotating specials.  I decided on the chicken cacciatore.  Big portion. No pasta. Potato and veggies. I was stuffed!!  Besides BYOBs, I also have a weakness for restaurants that are walkable. Check.  PROS: BYOB, Friendly servers, open kitchen, large menu for a small place, WALKABLE.   CONS: Lame Corkage fees, could use an interior face lift.   Overall: This a stable on my friend's restaurant rotation so I am sure I will be back sooner rather than later!   I am curious how this place will do with all the new development in the Northside. I hope it only helps them!"}
{"text":"Legend's lived up to the hype in many ways. The atmosphere is perfect western PA Italian restaurant. The food is delicious - chicken scallopini and veal parmigiana are exactly what you want them to be. The scallopini red wine sauce with mushrooms and capers was great! Fresh pasta and homemade fudge are also delicious. More than anything, the service and hospitality of the owner and staff made our night!"}
{"text":"Oh my... Ohhh my....   So, I would rate the food here a 5 star, but MAN can they mess up service. I came in to get takeout dinner after visiting someone in the hospital. They were packed, but the waitress 1 tells me to take a seat at the counter and she would be back with me.   10 minutes later, waitress 2 says, do you need a drink while you wait for your food, and I explain that she never came back to get my order. So waitress 2 goes and gets waitress 1. I give waitress 1 my order, and waitress 2 stops her half way through and specifies that she needs to use the togo menu prices. She says ok ok and I assume that is what she has done. I pay my bill and ask for the itemized receipt (because I wanted to make sure that she put no pasta with the chicken parm). Waitress 2 comes over and looks at the itemized receipt and gets obviously mad, asks for my card back, refunds my money and re-rings it in at togo prices.  Then, I ask again if the chicken parm will have veg instead of pasta and both waitress 1 and 2 say yes.   My food comes up, I ask again if the chicken parm has veg instead of pasta and waitress 1 looks in the bag and says yep then staples the bag shut... UMMMM redflag!  So I am waiting on something and I open the bag... There is pasta and no veg. Now, normally I wouldn't care, but this lady already messed up the price, and I asked about it about 50 times, so I was annoyed....So was waitress 2, she comes over and grabs the bag and walks to the kitchen and demands veg. She also adds bread to the bag because waitress 1 didn't put any in AND gives me a gift card for $10 off my next purchase.   As for the food. My ravioli was great, my husband liked the chicken parm, the veg was good, salads were average-small, bread was really good, and the fried parm was better than most.   It is sad that one bad employee can color an experience so much. I think I will go back, just to see if this is a regular or one time thing."}
{"text":"Solid little Italian place! The mozzarella triangles are Awesome, and their sauce is boss.   I had The Godfather (salami, pepperoni, prosciutto, and provolone on their housemade focaccia). It was pretty alright! My favorite part was the top and bottom layers of salami that had been crisped under a salamander or in the oven, like a pepperoni cup on a great pizza.   Their focaccia is good...better if dipped in salt, pepper, Parmesan, and olive oil.   Others got the Cajun chicken sandwich, the pasta of the day (tortellini) and fettuccine Alfredo, and every single plate was empty when the waitress came to clear the table.   It's tiny and it filled up not long after they opened, but the service is fast and the food is worth it!  Oh, and they give you fudge at the end of the meal. Very homey feel to this place!"}
{"text":"You can taste that everything is fresh and homemade. The spot is BYOB and this is a quaint, cozy place with a pleasant atmosphere and a lot of regulars coming through the doors. Do make a reservation ahead of time. My only advice: Note the cannoli are served warm and, while good in themselves, this presentation likely isn't everyone's expectation."}
{"text":"Legends does pasta right.  The noodle is the most important ingredient in pasta and legends' noodles are perfectly al dente. I got a spicy shrimp penne dish. I'm still dreaming about it.  It was also a very generous portion size. My friend got the spinach ravioli which I tried, simply delicious.  The only negative is it gets pretty loud in there.  VERY loud."}
{"text":"Amazingly delizioso! Excellent service too!! Very cozy atmosphere! This is an absolute must try if looking for Italian food."}
{"text":"I spend a lot of time on the North Side, so I'd been meaning to try this place for a while. My boyfriend and I went in on a Tuesday around 7:30 PM, and we were the only people in the house.  The food:  I tried a house special dish of the day - It was a blackened flank steak over penne with peppers, sun-dried tomatoes in a gorgonzola cream sauce. The dish was excellent, the right combination of sweet, salty, and savory, and the steak was on point. It came with a house salad that was a delicious blend of fresh greens with olives, peppers, tomatoes, the like. It also included grilled bread with a bottle of olive oil and Parmesan cheese for dipping.  My boyfriend ordered the Veal Parm, it also tasted great, but it was nothing outstanding.  Tuesday is there \"Greens and Beans\" for 99 cents special, so we also gave that a whirl. It was decent, lacked some flavor, but I wouldn't order it again.  The Staff:  Service was excellent, our waitress was attentive and answered all of our dumb questions. You can also see the cooks making the good, all around they seemed pleasant.  The Ambience: We were not aware this was an \"upscale\" Italian restaurant; from the vibe, the name, and the decor, you'd think standard Pittsburgh food. True to the name \"Legends\" the walls were lined with your staple Pittsburgh sports news clippings. The whole place was tiny, so the tables and chairs followed suit. I would by no means have minded the ambience of the food matched the theme- but it was a $20 average plate place, and I would have appreciated the vibe to match. They also placed terribly loud, out-of-date pop hits I could have lived without. Even silence would be better.   All around, the food was great, not excellent, but overpriced for the setting and ambience. I would recommend and I may go again. Also, be weary - it's BYOB with a $4/person corking fee."}
{"text":"This is hands down the best italian restaurant in the city.  Chef Dan makes you feel at home in this cozy little restaurant.  The open kitchen is very entertaining.  I usually get one of the specials as I have worked my way through most of the menu.  Every dish is better than the last.   The Antipasto appetizer is always a good choice."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a gem. Wanted to check out another neighborhood in Pittsburgh. To an ignorant outsider, North Side didn't seem much more sketch than South Side or Oakland.   After picking up two bottles of red at Wine and Spirits on Ohio Street, my team and I got a table at the warm, homey Legends of the North Shore, where it's BYOB. For appetizers we ordered the margherita bruschetta (best choice), fried polenta, and greens 'n beans (mainly because we went on a Tuesday when they had a special deal for 99 cents with any entree). The focaccia bread is great with the homemade mixture of olive oil and herbs.   I ordered the mussels bianca over linguine--terrific. Also comes with shrimp. The portions are generous but delicious, in part because it's clear that the tomato sauces are all made fresh and in-house. I tried my coworkers gnocchi--good, but I was quite satisfied with my own dish. My coworker who ordered the eggplant parmigiano really enjoyed her dish as well."}
{"text":"Fantastic, home style Italian food in a cozy atmosphere.  Go for the red sauce dishes with Mama's sauce.  Chicken parm was a standout.  Ok for families and business folks alike.  Some of the immediate neighborhood can be rough; adds to the ambience.  Only negative is no alcohol-- byob.  Corking fee of $4 pp."}
{"text":"I definitely love this place!  A fantastic example of a little neighborhood restaurant just serving perfect hand-made food and getting it right.  The food is so savory and just melts in your mouth.  You can't go wrong with the specials.  My only complaints (which are minor) are that parking can be a bit of an issue (street parking only) and for the love of god, you need to make reservations (they get a bit shirty with you if you don't).  But these are so minor, I don't even think they affect my rating at all.  The food is phenomenal and the atmosphere is wonderful."}
{"text":"I was shocked at how good the Penne Vodka was for the price.  While it isn't a \"bargain\" plate, I was really surprised at how fantastic it was!!  I judge a place by its Penne Vodka and previously only one other restaurant in Pittsburgh have I found who makes it decently.  Legends, however, tastes just like homemade New York vodka sauce.  The place is small, so I would suggest making a reservation ahead of time.  We went on a Friday night with a group of 9 people.  My only negatives is that they will not split a bill with a certain amount of people at the table and charged everyone at the table for drinking (when I didn't, because I don't drink alcohol).  The waitresses also seemed to not enjoy their job and be really annoyed.  I don't know, maybe that's part of the attempt to make you feel like you're sitting in a real Italian restaurant in Queens, but they definitely played the part.  The place is BYOB with a corking fee.  The chef came out and he was really nice and he didn't give off the vibe of \"I'm just trying to make you feel special by coming out here\" but more of a \"I needed to stretch my legs and wanted to see how the food was going over with the customers.\"  I plan on coming back to Legends of the North Shore.  The service wasn't bad enough to turn me off from the food, but I've read a few reviews who complained about poor service so I hope they find a way to improve!"}
{"text":"Love the \"cozy\" atmosphere. They keep it simple but the food is delicious. I've gone a few times and have had great service each time. Only complaint is that the prices can be rather expensive for the basics, especially since the portions are on the smaller side ($18 for a small bowl of alfredo with little chicken). Update: They increased their prices so now alfredo is $21.50!"}
{"text":"Wonderful neighborhood Italian restaurant.  BYOB.  Food is delicious and many dishes are family recipes.  Greens & Beans are the best in the city!  As is the hand made spaghetti & meatball with Mama\"s gravy.   Deserts are also homemade so save room!  Service is very friendly which suits the atmosphere.  I love this place so much, I had my wedding rehearsal dinner here 12 years ago.  They have never missed a beat!"}
{"text":"One of my favorites - unpretentious fine dining! Reservations are a really good idea on the weekends. I was just here - we started with the beans and greens which are outstanding - they have a food truck dedicated to this dish that makes the rounds of the 'burgh. Warm flatbread (focaccia) with rosemary is served with all meals , yum! I had their spots, which are so tender, light, tasty and never fishy. Served with great mashed taters and a fresh veggie mix, all great. Partner had their pasta special, which is pricey (for Legends, not for other places) because it's essentially 2 dinners on one 16\" platter! This was salmon over 2 types of ravioli, with peppers etc. in a white wide cream sauce. Partner requested no cream - no problem - they'll do whatever it takes to make you happy! The service is outstanding, it's BYOB, the salads are very tasty (I forgot to include those) as are the soups,the main courses are sublime. But wait! The desserts are homemade, and super! Coconut cream pie a mile high, triple chocolate cake a 1/4 mile high, and others - but I usually get one of those two. And wait - you get complimentary fudge (chocolate or peanut butter - or both) at the end of the meal. A lot of excellent food in a very comfortable environment, moderately priced. What's not to love??"}
{"text":"What a great, low key, friendly and excellent restaurant. The food is cooked with heart and tastes like your mom made it. Nothing fancy here, but it is all really simple and good. BYOB. I would definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"A great little Italian inspired restaurant right next to AGH. Fresh italian dishes that surprised us with flavor. Small interior and friendly staff make you feel welcome. They offer daily specials. Fantastic desserts and complimentary homemade fudge was offered at the end of our meal. Blackened shrimp pasta was amazing! Mussels and shrimp linguine and spaghetti were also enjoyed during our visit. Just go and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Came here with some clients for lunch.  Neat location in an old building and has been here forever. Obligatory Steelers memorabilia hung everywhere.  Ordered some paninis which were outstanding. Particularly liked the homemade bread.  Worth coming to if in the area."}
{"text":"Legends makes a great little lunch spot.   It's not large inside, which adds intimacy to the experience. It feels a little like you're eating in someone's home.   The menu is not extensive, but is supplemented by daily specials. They make most of their own pasta here (maybe all of it, I'm not sure), and that pasta is chewy and excellent!  Portions are not huge, and the prices are a bit high, but the dishes I've tried here have been delicious. They also make a nice house salad, and I can recommend their fried cheese and tomato gravy as a great starter.   Service is very nice, friendly, patient, and knowledgeable. If you like a home-cooking style of Italian food, I recommend Legends without hesitation."}
{"text":"I wasn't sure what to make of this place before actually eating there, but I'm glad I trusted my date, who assured me I'd love it, and gave it a chance.  We had reservations for a Thursday at 7pm.  As other reviewers said, it's probably wise to call ahead as the restaurant itself is extremely small and cramped - just how an old-school italian joing should be!  We were seated promptly in the back corner with our bottles of wine and brought out fresh baked bread.  Next, we ordered the mussles in the red sauce.  These are the biggest, juiciest mussles I have ever had - they were delicious and I could've drank the sauce with a straw!  I ordered the chicken scallopini and my date had the blackened shrimp pasta.  Both of our meals were cooked to absolute perfection and tasted delicious.  I've already reccommended Legends to a number of my friends.  It's not somewhere I've heard of before, but it's definitely somewhere I would revisit in a heartbeat.  Really good food, a cute, original atmosphere and BYOB - cant be beat, IMO."}
{"text":"legends is losing a star. for being closed for lunch on Saturdays! who does that?"}
{"text":"Quaint and romantic with great food. I get consistently good service and there is a great neighborhood feeling that I enjoy about Legends. Really worth the visit."}
{"text":"Legends of the North Shore came with quite a reputation, including a best-of-Pittsburgh restaurants award. But, overall, I did not think the food quite lived up to it. It was good, but not out of the ordinary, in its Italian-American fare.  We ordered a Bruschetta appetizer for four to start. Now this was the best item of the meal! It was served in a round portion, resembling a pizza. Very tasty and high recommended.  For my main course, I ordered the Spaghetti & Meatball. It came with a thick tomato sauce called \"Mama's Gravy\". (\"Gravy\" is a common Italian-American name for pomodoro sauce in Pennsylvania and other areas of the East Coast.) A single large meatball in the middle. Very good, but not with the zestiness I had anticipated in this setting. A tossed salad was included. One must request ground pepper for the salad and parmesan cheese for the main.  We did not go for a dessert, but by the look of those served to other tables, the portions are huge!  If I were to come again, I would try one of the veal dishes.  Legends of the North Shore is located in the North Side neighborhood of Pittsburgh, north of the Allegheny River from downtown. Reservations are a must on weekends."}
{"text":"It looks like a diner, it is priced like a decent restaurant and it tastes great. The idea here is simple you are paying for quality of the ingredients, not the table cloths or snooty waiters.  Our meal started with the fried motzerrla  7.95. It came as 5 huge hunks of cheese, with a great marana sauce. This was made in house, not frozen sticks from a box, they come as large triangles.   Meals include a some great rosemary bread, olive oil and soup or salad. For my main I had the spinach ravioli in a pink sauce $15. This was a generous portion of homemade ravioli with enough spinach to taste and rich ricotta cheese. The sauce was luxurious and packed with savory goodness.  Service was fun and family like, the meal ended with a complimentary piece of homemade fudge.  Maybe this is not good for a 1st date but its good for a great meal or  a casual 4th date for when the food matters more than the looks."}
{"text":"Very good. Friendly service, my mom would say it was too plain, i say it was just perfect. I would totally recommend this joint to my friends, and would definably bring my girlfriend here. Next time your in Pittsburgh, give it a go. The shrimps were large and impressive"}
{"text":"Amazing! Great, handmade, homemade, Italian-American food. The pasta is handmade, and you can taste how fresh and well prepared it is.  The blackened shrimp is awesome, the sauce on most of the pasta is described as 'mama's gravy' and it's a great red sauce.  The lobster ravioli are great as is the gnocchi. The staff is great too.  When its nice out, you can eat outside on the side. Chef Dan and Family Know what they are doing."}
{"text":"Legends of the North Shore on the top 25 restaurants in Pittsburgh list? I would have to disagree. I joined a three dining companions for dinner on a recent Friday night. When I walked in, I was shocked by how incredibly tiny it is inside. We were crammed at a table next to a large party. Our server was very matter of fact and to the point. What I would expect eating at a dinner, not a nice Italian restaurant. I decided to order the Penne Vodka with prosciutto and the wedding soup. The soup was nothing memorable. I enjoyed the crisp bread (foccacia) and oil better. When the entree's arrived, I was surprised that my Penne vodka was garnished with prosciutto. I assumed from the menu that there would be more proscuitto than a thin two inch slice on top of the dish. Overall, the sauce was very good. Not too creamy, not to tomatoey. However, I enjoyed my husband's gnocchi bolognese much more. The gnocchi was tender and the sauce was flavorful and meaty. All in all, I doubt I will be heading back to Legends. With so many great restaurants in Pittsburgh, Legends doesn't make my list."}
{"text":"Another Northside neighborhood favorite! Although the physical structure and ambiance leave a bit to be desired. The food and staff surely make up for it!  The staff is always super friendly, even when you stroll in late in the evening a glass or two of wine into your night.   The food is all house made and truly delicious! The Virginia spots are one of my personal favorites. Honesty anything you try you'll be sure to love.  It is BYOB but beware of the corkage fee per person."}
{"text":"After reading some peoples reviews I wasn't sure of this place. My boyfriend and I decided to go anyways. All I can say is, wow you people don't know food if you left a negative remark! Our food was phenomenal. The service was phenomenal. No it isn't a super fancy place, but the food is incredible and very reasonably priced. Our $56 dinner was worth every penny. I had a special, he had ravioli's and we split a desert. Amazing little place that I will 100% go to again."}
{"text":"I'm pretty much committed to trying EVERY BYOB restaurant around so this was on my list for a long time. Friends told me it wasn't worth it but I persisted to the point that we went there for lunch yesterday. My first reaction was not a pleasant one. The cheap plastic chairs, the small close together tables, the tacky decorations, not a good feel but I pressed on.   Now, I didn't avail myself of the BYOB (might have resulted in a higher rating!!) and it was only lunch so I can't comment on dinner. Regrettably, I won't ever try them for dinner so this is the best I can offer.  I think Legends in their name only applies to the sports heroes and not any legendary food experience you'll find here.   The place is essentially a diner. Diner atmosphere, diner chairs, diner specials, diner everything. Not that I don't appreciate diners, I do. But this atmosphere is BLAH.  I'd rate it a max of 2 stars. Max.   Food on the other hand is ok. Not great. Ok. Worth going out of your way for? Absolutely not. I had the Parma hot sausage with a bowl of black bean soup- both things I love!!! We're these memorable? Not in the least. It's generous to say they were adequate. \"Mama's gravy\", a marinara sauce of sorts, was lackluster and flavorless. The sausage was just a split link of hot sausage and something I could replicate at home with ease. The black bean soup was listless and uninspired. Sad because i was expecting (hoping?) for so much more.  I wish I had ordered the chicken parm that the guys pressing up against me from behind ordered. It looked way better. But I'll not have that chance cause I won't be going back. I'll drive by this place a thousand times to go to other more deserving places on the Northside.   Sorry. Didn't do it for me.  Can't even imagine coming here for dinner with a bottle of wine. Would be awful.  I wanted to give it 2 stars but felt a little generous today. Plus, I thought if I worked down the block, I'd probably come here for lunch. But never would I go out of my way to go here."}
{"text":"Headed there for lunch today.  Great little place with excellent food. Foccacia bread unbelievable. ...... A must it's so good.  Panini sandwich are great about 8-10$ s. Includes cup of soup or salad. Entrée s are from 10-20$.   Homemade deserts good too. Had a huge piece of apple pie. No price on menu turned out to be 6.95$.  So not and everyday place. It's hard to get a 5 with me. Go 4.5 if I could."}
{"text":"Legends is awesome! Friendly, efficient wait staff, excellent food & a really hot chef! I will return!"}
{"text":"I checked this place out for the first time on a Saturday night. We got seats at the bar just inside the door and thus had a good view of the whole establishment. The atmosphere is unpretentious with a friendly neighborhood vibe - there were obviously lots of happy regulars.   The food was great from start to finish. We started with the hot antipasto and the greens & beans, which were perfectly seasoned. My dining partner, who has a less adventurous palate, was very happy with her spaghetti and meatballs. I got the halibut special, which was flaky and tender with a delicious apricot chutney, served over arugula. We decided to split a house made cannoli for dessert, which was warm and gooey and just plain yummy. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Its okay, but it was just ok.    There's a $4 per person corking fee which caught us off guard.  We were expecting that would be for the table.  We started with the polenta and the mozzarella.  The mozzarella was unremarkable, deep friend mozzarella in breading.  Of course it was good, it is fried cheese!  But it was nothing special.  The polenta was a real stand out, tasted home made and was delicious.  They give you garlic olive oil and garlic bread sticks to dip in the oil.  This was free so I'm not complaining, but that just seemed a heavy and oily combo to me.  Also, the breadsticks were covered in rosemary, and I loathe rosemary.  My friend had the special, pan seared shrip over pesto penne, and she loved it.  I had this chicken dish with apricots and it was ... alright.  It was good but I felt like the searing on the chicken could have made this dish excellent.  Overall I would come here again but maybe I'd stick with a staple like chicken parmigana."}
{"text":"12/15/12 heard about Legends so we thought we would give it a try tonight following our attending the Musical Christmas Carol.  We had reservations which are needed given the size of the place.  Maybe a capacity of 35 or 40.   We got seated right away.  I ordered the beans and greens and the Bird ordered the mussels for appetizers.  Although I tend to like beans and greens with sausage, they did not have sausage however they were really tasty.   The mussels were a nice portion and also very good.  The Bird ordered the Gnocchi with the meat sauce.  Again, it was a nice portion and they were very good!  I ordered the tortellini special which also turned out to include the ravioli.  (A nice surprise ).  The dinner salads were also above average in that they included Gorgonzola , Greek olives, and cucumber.  I wasn't that crazy about the Italian dressing but it was still ok.  Price wise our meal was around $80 which included $4 corking fee.  However we saw on the menu if you present your theater tix you get a 10% discount!  (Another nice surprise )  Parking was easy.  On street a block away.  All in all, a cool place with great food and great service.  We'll be back."}
{"text":"Great food with friendly service. Place is small so be sure to make a reservation and they don't serve liquor so bring your own bottle. I don't eat meat and they were more than accommodating. I have the gnocchi (without meat) while my wife had the jumbo shrimp over penne, both were fantastic! Be sure to save room for their incredible desserts."}
{"text":"How have I never been here before?  How have I never even heard of Legends?  No more.   I went here for lunch and it was delicious!  The location = little scary, especially if you would go at night.  The atmosphere = not top notch.  The food = excellent.     I was very pleasantly surprised with my entire meal.  The bread with the rosemary dipping oil was quite good.  The salad was also very tasty.  It had blue cheese and roasted red peppers which I can't get enough of and no iceberg lettuce in sight.  I opted for the spinach and ricotta ravioli in a basil tomato cream sauce.  It was very good.   Not the best I've ever had but solid.  Lots of sauce to dip more of the tasty bread in.   Did I let it end there?  Of course, not.  I had a giant slice of apple pie with ice cream.  The apples were sliced a little too thickly for my liking but it was a darn good slice of apple pie and that's coming from someone who makes an out of this world homemade apple pie.  Needless to say, I didn't get much work done that afternoon because I could barely move."}
{"text":"We LOVED Legends! Went for a date night this past Saturday. Food was superb(and reasonably priced for quality), service was great, and it was a really pleasant environment. We had a great time and I would highly recommend Legends to anyone looking for a fabulous Italian dinner."}
{"text":"Legends is good...but not special. It's just your typical Italian-American restaurant, but with a shorter menu than most. Huge portions of pasta, as expected. Started with Mussels Diablo which were good, but we had a lot of closed shells. I had the Penne alla Vodka and the sauce was good, especially with fresh basil leaves. The pasta was a bit overcooked. Basically, if you're Italian you know how to make this food at home. That doesn't make it bad, just A-OK!  The party next to us brought a bottle of grape Pucker vodka and tonic water as their BYOB. Hey, whatever works..."}
{"text":"So Pittsburgh! This is such a neighborhood gem! We took my grandmother here for her 82nd birthday and had such a good time. Nothing too fancy, just good 'ole Italian food, made in the kitchen right in front of you."}
{"text":"A decent, if very very basic menu. Roughly Italian American fare with friendly service, decent prices and a fairly comfortable (if lack of) atmosphere. I would go back without regret, but I was hoping for an old-school, Italian-American hidden gem like one would find in New York, Chicago, New Jersey or Detroit, but it is more old-school Pittsburgh...."}
{"text":"This is the kind of restaurant that lets the food speak for its self.  It's not fancy - the decor to me is very nostalgic, as I am a relocated Pittsburgher.  The special is usually the best thing on the menu that day.  Their prices are a little high, but I think for the quality, it's not too bad.  I love a good BYOB restaurant... I go here a lot when I visit my parents, who live on the north side and I have never, ever had a bad meal.  The service is usually very good.  My only complaint was that last time they were out of wedding soup and that is my absolute favorite :)  Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"The bruschetta is huge!  The spinach ravioli is really good, as is the veal parm.  I'd definitley go back."}
{"text":"What a gem! I don't know if this is a new place or people just haven't heard of it, but my party and I came here. It's quite small but it was BYOB and the food was amazing! I had the ahi tuna special and it was fresh and delicious. Everyone else seemed very pleased with their meals as well. I'd love to eat here again if I had another chance to go to Pittsburgh. Staff was also very friendly despite finding out I was from Michigan and a Red Wings fan."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised to find this quaint and cozy little Italian restaurant during my weekend trip to Pittsburgh. I was really fortunate to get seated without having a reservation on a Friday night but I think the fact that I was dining alone helped.   I ordered the mussels bianco which came with a soup or salad to start. I opted for the salad which was pretty basic but I have no complaints since it was kind of free. The vegetables were fresh and the vinaigrette was light and tart. The bread here is really tasty with a hint of what I think is rosemary - it had a nice toasted crisp and paired great with the olive oil. I mean bread and olive oil is a classic combination that you cannot go wrong with. I ate the entire basket all by myself!   I chose the red sauce VS white sauce when it came to my mussels bianco. Despite being told to pretty much avoid seafood in Pittsburgh - the mussels and the shrimp that came with the pasta weren't bad! Usually when mussels aren't fresh it has a really gritty texture but all the mussels I got were big and yummy. The linguine was cooked a little past the al dente texture that I preferred but overall it didn't hinder from the dish too much. I really enjoyed the flavor of the red sauce and thought it had a great kick. The portion was so big I had to get a to-go box. I dug into the box later on that night though because it was so good."}
{"text":"Legends is a an old style American-Italian restaurant. The restaurant is so small and they have a problem with managing customers. People who came in with reservations waited for at least 20 minutes to get seated to their tables. Other people who walked-in were seated immediately if they promise \"to eat in less than an hour\" I guess they have reservations for other people for the same table but they want to get customers anyway. I was able to witness all of that because I was seated on the bar table which has the cashier/host. The food was less than average. I tried 3 different orders + desserts, nothing was impressing."}
{"text":"I took a date here back in high school and got lucky after so it must have been pretty good because I was gangly as hell back then.  4/5 clams - TV"}
{"text":"I feel like I'm being generous with my star allocation.  But I also feel that I need to be a bit forgiving since I've been sick the past few days and my tastebuds are a bit off.    That being said the friends I was with also didn't seem overly impressed by the food, so I think I'm being generous and the rating should be more like 2.5.  I ordered the spinach ravioli and they were just ok.  There was way too much sauce and I guess I anticipated it to taste a bit more basily or something - it did say basil cream sauce, but what I got just seemed like a whole lotta tomato vodka sauce.  The spinach and ricotta didn't have much flavor, but perhaps that was due to my diminished lack of taste these few days with being sick.  All I could taste was the tomato sauce and that to me does not make a great or particularly good meal.    Oh and to top it off the $4/person corkage fee is outrageous."}
{"text":"Legends is that nice neighborhood restaurant that I probably forget about too often. Simple Italian food at a good price. It's also BYOB which is a bonus!"}
{"text":"Really great food. It is a hidden gem in Pittsburgh. If your looking for a great place to eat I recommend this."}
{"text":"I ate here this past Friday evening with my girlfriend and two other dining companions.  I had made 7 PM reservations for us and we arrived shortly before that to a table that was ready for us.  The inside of the restaurant is actually much tinier than I had expected with as many people crammed in as possible.  It probably was helped that the night we were there, there was a party of 10+ next to us.  They would also order just before us understandably leading to some slower service times for us which I would guess is not the norm.  Other than it being crowded there was not much else in the dining room to look, just some table and chairs as well as some pictures on the walls.  For dinner my girlfriend and I decided to start of the evening with the polenta to share.  It came out cut into pieces and served with some sweet sausage and a pesto drizzle.  I thought that the sweet sausage was the best part of it with the polenta being ok while my girlfriend really enjoyed the polenta.  For our dinner entrees I ordered the Penne Vodka which came with a tomato basil cream sauce and prosciutto while my girlfriend went with the Penne Parma that had some artichoke hearts, roasted red peppers, olives and sweet sausage in a garlic wine sauce.  Both pastas also came with salads before the meal and both my girlfriend and I ordered the house balsamic dressing.  The salads came topped with many different things and I thought that they were pretty good salads for being included in the meal.  The Penne Vodka that I ordered ended up being really good!  It was delivered when still at a fairly hot temperature and I really enjoyed the sauce.  It's only peculiar item was that the prosciutto was almost off to the side and not in the pasta which I found to be odd but I still enjoyed it.  Even though I really enjoyed my pasta, I actually thought that my girlfriends meal tasted better.  The garlic wine sauce on hers was awesome and made each bite of her entrée that I had a treat.  The bottom line for me is that I would definitely head back here again.  I was very happy with all of the food that we had and also loved that the prices were good for the quality of food that they were serving."}
{"text":"Service is friendly and quick! Everything comes at a timely manner and all the food is fairly priced. Although it's a little small, it's really amazing! The pasta is incredible!"}
{"text":"Excellent service, amazing food I do not hesitate to recommend this restaurant. Very generous portion and the staff is great! The chef and his wife are really friendly. We'll go again for sure"}
{"text":"My family and I love this place! We go here all the time. Mamma's gravy tastes just like our childhood. It's a BYOB, so that's always a plus. The food is always delicious.  The desserts are huge, so plan on splitting them."}
{"text":"Tasty traditional, not trendy and tempermental. Greens & beans rock! Dining here is as if your best friend invited you to tag along to Sunday dinner at his chef Uncle Nino's place. BYOB of Chianti to pair with the solid unpretentious food in a modest setting with a nostagic wait-staff. Long before the open kitchen concept became a hot topic, this cook's line has turned out many a quality  plate over the years."}
{"text":"OK, so based off the recommendation of my date, I thought  that I would like Legends North Shore but I left dinner disappointed and in need of a mint to mask the over abundance of garlic (salt) that I had consumed.  This restaurant is in a prime location on the North Side and has plenty of opportunity to capitalize on the growth in the area. That said, allow me to jump into some of the minuses:  Beans and Greens appetizer - I love beans and greens, but was shocked by the amount of garlic the chef added. Actually, I don't think it was garlic...I believe it was garlic salt (a huge no-no) Don't get me wrong, I love garlic, but there was so much that it killed a simple, rustic dish.  Blackened Shrimp Pasta - My date and I shared this dish. This dish tasted as though an entire container of garlic salt had accidentally been dropped onto the plate before being served. The shrimp and pasta, however, were cooked well. Had the chef backed off the garlic he would have presented a more edible dinner. i was not in the mood to send this dish back to the kitchen, but did call this out to the waitress once our meal concluded.  The restaurant is cute, in a great location, and service is friendly and prompt. These are all important things to me, but quality and taste takes precedence.  Unfortunately, Legends just didn't do it for me.  Would I go back? Most likely not. There are far too many other Italian restaurants in Pittsburgh that I would like to give a try."}
{"text":"The best place in the world.  I love the special board but always come back for mommas gravy. Service is experienced and super nice.  Chef Dan has an open kitchen that you can watch him create.  You will love this place.  Ps save room for his home made deserts.  Actually home made!"}
{"text":"liked this place, felt like eating at a relative's house.  low prices. last time I was there, I ordered the lunch panini special, very good but not great.   I would recommend this place for lunch if you were looking for something causal"}
{"text":"Service was kind of slow but the food made up for it. There were four of us and all had different menu items. Every one was fantastic!"}
{"text":"What a hidden gem! Came here last night for dinner with two friends and discovered a new favorite restaurant. This small but fabulous spot has amazing service and food. They start you off with some super fresh (I mean directly out of the oven) bread with olive oil and herbs amazing. I went with the Blackened Shrimp and loved every bite. It had a great flavor and just a small amount of heat on the pasta. I was also pleasantly surprised with my  salad before my pasta. Great field greens and veggies.  The service hear is friendly and I LOVED that all the servers and hostesses helped each other out. We finished the meal with a bite of homemade fudge that our server brought us. So good!! Be sure to come to Legends! I can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"Older restaurant on the North Shore. Exterior is not fancy and had some people in our party nervous. The interior is small and could use some updates as well but the staff was very friendly. We ate ob a Saturday at 430pm right after they opened and they weren't busy yet. The bathroom was very small but clean. Street parking only. Prices average approx $15 per person. The ravioli were very good with vodka cream sauce and I would get it again. I know the beans and greens got mixed reviews but I thought it was delicious with excellent seasoning and was not too runny. If I am ever back, I would consider having the beans and greens as my meal even because it was so good and there was enough to of it. The soup was hearty but bland. If you're in the area this is a good place to get a meal and I would return."}
{"text":"Don't listen to the negative reviews.  Yes it is a bit of a small dive, but we had a great staff and an excellent meal.  Highly recommend the vodka sauce and the pasta fagiole."}
{"text":"I have been here several times and always have a great experience! The food is always delicious, the staff is super friendly, and there are plenty of different dishes to choose from. The desserts are particularly great! The apple pie is delicious :)"}
{"text":"Family style portions and setting.  Good food, not gourmet.  A little loud and close tables for an intimate evening.   Great place for friends to catch up, not a date."}
{"text":"Great spot if you're looking for a quality Italian meal. Food is always fantastic and consistent. Highly recommend the chicken parm - large portion and very tasty. BYOB is a nice bonus. Good spot before a concert or sporting event. Be sure to make a reservation."}
{"text":"Legends...interesting name. With a name like Legends, one would assume sports bar, but not so much. And I very much liked it that way! Let's roll into a pro/con list...  Pros: -Great, friendly service. Morgan was my server and she was super fantastic. Quick, efficient, sweet. She offered up helpful suggestions and even let me try a sample of the soup of the day before I placed my order. -Homemade focaccia: Mmmm rosemary! Tasty and free slivers of love to go with your meal.  -Portions: Mammoth. From the bowls of soup to the pastas to the pies...sharing is caring. -Spinach ravioli: My main dish of choice. Flavorful spinach and cheese pillows of pasta cooked al dente and smothered with tomato basil sauce with a touch of cream. Damn good pasta, my friends.  Cons: -Menu items price out a few dollars higher than similar Italian joints. But, the value is here, though, because of the increased portions.  -Restaurant set up/ambiance: Is a bit odd. It's kinda like a diner...with bare tables...and carpet...and a few random pictures on the wall.  -No booze, beer or wine. It is BYO, but I didn't see the corkage fees listed on their menu.  Overall, a solid place for homecooked Italian eats. I would sprint back to Legends just for that ravioli! Mangia!"}
{"text":"Rated one of Pittsburgh's best in 2012 I was excited to enter Legends and prepare for  what was sure to be an amazing meal. Upon entering Legends, you get the immediate \"hole in the wall\" vibe (a vibe that I love) with diner style tables and chairs.   We started with the margarita bruschetta. This was delicious, increasing my already high expectations. Our waitress came back- I ordered the Penne Vodka and unfortunately was overwhelmingly disappointed.   The sauce, although good, is simply ordinary. I've been to countless Italian restaurants in Pittsburgh and could name at least 20 better than Legends.    Had Legends not received substantial praise I may have not been so disappointed, but when you're touted as one of the best I expect nothing short. To their benefit the restaurant is BYOB, maybe this gets so much praise because everyone's drunk before their meal is served...  Food C+, Service B-"}
{"text":"Excellent little place.  Went for Lunch and couldn't be more pleased.  Located right by AGH hospital."}
{"text":"This was my first time coming here. As a resident at AGH, I often drove pass without noticing this restaurant.  However, last Friday my attending was kind enough to take us out for lunch here.  Per his recommendation, I ordered the penne vodka. The food was excellent.  However, midway eating I noticed I bit into something and pulled out a coiled metal wire. I assume it was from whatever they were using to clean and scrub dishes with.  We politely informed the staff who were apologetic but was surprised they did not comp the meal for that dish. Overall food was good but was not satisfied with how our situation was handled."}
{"text":"This was my boyfriend's choice for his birthday dinner. We had both heard great things, plus we love BYOB spots.  I'll start with saying that the service was great. Our waitress made us feel like regulars that have been frequenting the restaurant for years.  We both ordered specials. They were different preparations of fish. Both were really good. Everything we tasted was wonderful.  The downfall was when we got the check. The specials were both $30+. They were good - but not that good! You can find great Italian food elsewhere and skip the $100 tab."}
{"text":"Four of us on a Tuesday night...  Went like this:  Promptly seated, served soft beverages and a unique bread plate - almost like a long crouton.  Their signature dipping oil is fabulous!  We ordered a marguerite bruschetta to share - there was plenty and although it came with a healthy serving of marinara, that dipping oil did the trick for me, again!  Two of us ordered their lump crab pasta special.  Pasta was penne and it included artichoke and roasted peppers.  Very good and enough for lunch.  Hubs ordered the gnocchi and was a fan.  Friend ordered Scallopini and I gotta say, he was the winner!  Beautiful dish, well presented and he claimed it was beautiful the whole way through.  Being Tuesday it was Greens & Beans in a small side for $1 - what a deal, they were A++!  Here comes dessert:  Two of us got the triple chocolate cake and loved it.  Caution:  It is dark chocolate, not uber sweet.  One order of butter pecan cake that was loved.  I ordered the coconut cream cake and was the only one disappointed...  It was a heavy yellow custard, just not my favorite.  Parking:  Street Service:  Excellent Atmosphere:  quite casual  We would definitely all go back!"}
{"text":"Fantastic!  We only live 5 minutes away and it took us way too long to check this place out.  Everything we had was great -- bread, fried mozzarella, salad, chipotle red pepper soup, steak pizzaiolo, spinach ravioli.  Another plus is that you don't have to get dressed up...jeans are fine.  That said, I wouldn't hesitate to come here before an event at the Benedum or Heinz Hall."}
{"text":"We have been wanting to try Legends of the North Shore for a long time and since we were right across the street yesterday, we seized the lunch opportunity. It was not what I expected at all. Tiny I expected because I'd seen it driving by many times. Diner-esque inside, completely unexpected. I knew they are BYOB but after eating lunch here, I can't imagine any scenario where I'd take more than a couple of beers with me. Not a place to linger over a bottle of wine. Tables on top of each other, cramped and kind of a low end divey diner, uh uh.  I wanted the mussels for lunch but was told they were out of them. Not terribly disappointed because our server had just run through the lunch specials and one had caught my attention enough that I mentally considered changing my mind anyway. A fried zucchini plank sandwich with melted mozzarella and side of sauce. I do love a good zucchini plank and had never heard of anyone creating a sandwich out of them, so no hardship to change my order.   That was a greasy, good lunch sandwich....heavy on the greasy but, I've always loved some tasty 'fried deliciousness!'  Hubs had the sausage sandwich... good...but mine was the clear winner. Starter soups were homemade and tasty. Hubby had black bean and I had the chicken pastine, aka wedding soup. The broth rivaled my premium homemade Christmas chicken soup broth so no complaints on that.   Overall: ambiance 1star, mine and hubby's sandwiches 3 stars, soup 4 stars. Average is a 3 - not rushing back but I'd clearly have lunch there again, if I'm across the street."}
{"text":"We went on Valentine Day.  There was a special menu for the day. The tables are on top of each other, so it is definitely not a romantic place...but the food was good.  The noise level is a little no the load side, at least where we were sitting. Had to have the beans & greens with Italian sausage....tasted great! Had veal that came with some nicely cooked and fresh veggies.  A very good meal. We split a desert, that we were told are made in house, that was very good. BYOB a plus+! We enjoyed our meal and had very good service."}
{"text":"Awesome, cozy place. It has a friendly, family style atmosphere. The food is consistently great. The servers are inviting and seem genuinely happy to be there.   I love going here on a whim. So if you're looking for a great new place to go tonight, try it."}
{"text":"I am from out of town, and I have to say this place brings a lot of flavor and awesome hospitality. I love the creativity the chef's put into their  food for us to enjoy. This is definitely a good place for a romantic date or catching up with friends."}
{"text":"Wife And I went here for dinner last week. We made a reservation before hand as it is not a big place and it generally fills up fast. Suggestion dont come without a reservation. Once we got there we where brought right over to a table and seated. They brought over some hot bread with olive oil which was delicious and took drink orders The staff where super friendly and really very nice and helpful. I had the chicken part with spaghetti. The service here is fantastic. The chicken part was good and among the better that I have had not the best but definitely good. I would highly recommend Legends Eatery and I will definitely be going there again."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was cozy and comfortable.    The food was fairly pricey (specifically, the special was way more expensive than the meals listed in the menu) and the overall experience was fine."}
{"text":"We've lived on the Northside for a year and a half, and FINALLY checked out Legends last week. Wish we would have gone sooner! Everything was fantastic. From the complimentary bread and dipping oil (super tasty) that you start with, to the Fried Cannoli for dessert - delizioso! I had the Blackened Shrimp Pasta and my date had the Penne Vodka Pasta. Both dishes were packed with flavor and the portions were huge! The fact that they're byob was the cherry on top  definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Delicious! Delicious! Delicious! Starting with their bread, yummy Brussels sprouts and polenta as appetizers, great dressings on salads and great pasta dishes! I ordered chicken scaloppini that my friend highly recommended- which was to die for - you won't be disappointed if you decide to try! Deserts were excellent as well! We tried carrot caramel cake and apple pie- both made by owners wife at their home, as we found out later. Another great thing is that place is BOB. Service was great as well! No bad comments for this place other that it doesn't have parking so you have to street park.We are definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"This was our third time eating here. it just seems to get more dissapointing each time. Our waitress was not very friendly, and barely made eye contact. we ordered several small plates, and a salad. This was the smallest, most poor excuse for a salad i had ever seen. The rest of the food was pretty good. Unfortunately this place is way over-priced. We were charged $8 just to have our bottle of wine opened. The menu stated that the charge for opening the wine was $2.50 per person (and up) and there was only the two of us. So i guess that means they can charge whatever they feel like charging for removing a cork. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Great food- don't be fooled by the exterior. Had a great lunch there. The antipasto salad was delicious. Enough lettuce and some antipasto thrown in to make it a great salad.  I loved that they gave us complimentary fudge at the end of our meal."}
{"text":"Yay! I finally got to try Legends North Shore after having the place booked mark for a few months now and so can cross this place off my list. After walking in, Legends North Star is small but homey which was nice. The place was not filled so we had our pick of tables. Our waitresses were sweet and did not kick us out after we remained at our table to finish wine 30 minutes after closing.   Legends North Shore provides bread to munch on. Crunchy airy pieces that don't fill you up entirely before the entree which I so often do and they provide a bottle with seasoned olive oil (which was kind of oily on the outside). I tried the Tuesday 99 cent green and beans special along with a salad and spaghetti and meatballs. I wasn't sure what the green and beans were but they were cheesy and salty but very watery. I thought they were tasty but confused if what I ate were indeed what greens and beans were suppose to be. The salad was fresh but nothing special, and I felt the same for the spaghetti and meatballs (made in house from the meatball to the pasta). I feel that when you go to an Italian restaurant you can judge how well they cook based on classic dishes. I couldn't stop eating the spaghetti and meatballs though I felt full half way through. I thought the meal was overall good though not anything spectacular and pricey for what it was - ~$18 ($17 for spaghetti and meatballs and $.99 for the greens and beans plus some tax). Maybe if they knocked a few bucks off to $13 or $14 or so it would be more reasonable imho. Also points are deducted for the corkage fee of $4 per person, not per bottle. We were not aware so they basically made an easy $16 bucks from the four of us at dinner."}
{"text":"If I could give this restaurant a zero, I would. We were just asked by our waitress to leave because someone with a reservation was waiting for our table. My father and father-in-law were still finishing up their coffee and we had not yet finished our dessert! I've never been so humiliated. Do NOT go to this restaurant! Their food was mediocre at best. If you want excellent Italian in a small intimate restaurant, go to Dish on the South Side. I will not be going back."}
{"text":"Great dinner - hidden gem for lunch!  Try the chicken parm sandwich. Mama's gravy ...enough said!"}
{"text":"This is a really small restaurant and is BYOB. The servers are friendly and the food was good. I ordered two appetizers (small plates) which were very good - greens and beans and then muscles. The flavours were both good, but the muscles were served with multiple closed shells which for the small portion was a negative. I don't have much to say about this experience....It was just a-ok."}
{"text":"When my friend first suggested this I almost said no because I thought he wanted me to go to a strip club. LOL. But after I looked it up and looked at the menu I realized this was a classic old-school Italian restaurant. We showed up without reservations and ended up having to sit at the counter.  I actually really liked our seat. Service was wonderful. Everybody was super nice and the menu selections are solid. We both had the salmon special. Everything was cooked to perfection. We also had beans and greens with Italian sausage. Outstanding. This is not a fancy place, so people looking for a four star off the charts experience should go elsewhere. This is for people who want a family style casual Italian dining experience with very good food. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"So....what do you say when a highly rated place let's you down??  It was okay....  When a meal rocks my world, I usually want to lick the bowl clean, yes, like a dog.  I did not, sadly, feel that way about this place.  It IS BYOB but the catch is it's $4 PER glass.  Yep, that's right, not per table my friend.  Keep that in mind.  I got the greens and beans on recommendation from many Yelpers on here.  Maybe I just don't have the taste for it, but I thought it was weird, watery and....not good.  I also thought it was going to be green beans and it was kidney beans and spinach that tasted like a warm Caesar salad.  No thanks....  I ordered the Penne Vodka, which is my fav meal to order at Italian restaurants.  I also like to add a meatball on if it's homemade.  It was, in fact, confirmed to be homemade so I was all over it!  The meatball itself was delicious.  I love a bread-y meatball.  You know the type.  Soft and packed with flavor.  It was the winner of the night.  The vodka sauce was good, but I wanted way more.  Now I have to preface this by saying I'm a total sauce-aholic.  I love me a good amount of sauce, this didn't even come close.  Then I looked over at Serena R's plate, and her ravioli (which I thought was the same) was SWIMMING in it!  So I stole some of hers....  Would I come back?  If someone really wanted to.  But I have a hunch there's way better Italian places to dine at in the Burgh...so now I'm on the hunt!  I gotta connect with my roots, ya' know?"}
{"text":"The food was great. The focaccia bread and dipping oil were perfectly seasoned. We started with wedding soup which was nice and hot, not to mention delicious. I had the chicken parmigiano and my husband had the chicken scallopini. His was better, but no complaints about mine. Nice sized portions, a tad pricey. The place is small and awkward. Our service wasn't  great but not so bad that it would keep me away. Make a reservation."}
{"text":"I have been here several times and never disappointed. The food is very good and  loaded with garlic."}
{"text":"Just had lunch here today - my second visit - quite a few years after my first when the food and service was great!!!  Today, not so great!!  The food was average at best - certainly nothing to write home about!!  I had the gnocchi, my friend had a penne and sausage special which she enjoyed, but my dish was bland and the wedding soup was a huge disappointment as was the bread served to the table when we first arrived!!  Even more disappointing was the service!!!  Our waitress was very matter of fact - not at all friendly or welcoming!!!!!  She really needs to find something she enjoys doing!!!!!!   I had planned to take a few of my friends there for dinner in the coming days, but now I certainly will not!!!  I hear rave reviews about the place all the time - but now have serious doubts about giving them another try!!!"}
{"text":"Legends of the North Shore is great.  Great food and so much fun.  My family has been here twice (for my little brother's birthday and my dad's birthday) and the whole family loves it.  Legends is definitely a hidden gem and is very very casual.  At first walking up to it, I was a little unsure from the outside if we made a good choice in picking the restaurant.  Its definitely a small hole in the wall place but the food is so authentic so the whole vibe works together! One awesome thing about the small size and set up of Legends is that you can see into the kitchen while they cook.  It makes you feel like you are in a family kitchen!  All the food is great but I would say what makes this place even better is the atmosphere in the place.  You can tell everyone around you is relaxed and having a good time (the BYOB-ness of the restaurant probably helps this!).  But overall, as long as you are not looking for a 'fancy night' out, Legends is a fun and authentic Italian experience!"}
