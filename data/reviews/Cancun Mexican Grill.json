{"text":"Great place, family run and they are honest and helpful.  They are from el Salvador and get the papusas which are a specialty from there. Very cheap and good prices with good portion.  8.99 for three decent sized tacos with chips and salsa."}
{"text":"Great tortas, tacos, even papusas. They have specials, like $1.50 tacos on Tuesdays. Very authentic, and cheaper than Mexicanada which is up the street. Great job!"}
{"text":"Good family oriented restaurant. They recommended our meals when we asked about the menu. The other patrons must be regulars as they were very friendly and knew what was going on in each others lives.   We got Taco Tuesday deal for three tacos and a burrito. Both come with chips and sauce. I would go again to eat taco, burrito, and enchiladas here because there were no nonsense about price of food. It is just what you want. I don't need presentation of the food all the time, just give me my taco to eat and thank you. That is what this place is.   Tips: while they can accept credit cards, better to bring your cash for faster payment method.   I tired chicken, pork, and beef taco. I didn't like the chicken but loved the other two. Plus, the parking here is so much easier to find than the other Mexican restaurant in Bradford.   They are located way after the Shoppers Drugmart, but RIGHT before Midas."}
{"text":"Along the newer part of the extended main street of Bradford is Cancun Mexican Grill, a standout among McD, Timmy's, Swiss Chicken and other Canadian institutional food outlets.  It's small, and simple, less colorful than La MexiCanada, but good, simple food none the less.  I'm sure that being family owned has something to do with it.  The portions are slightly larger than La MexiCanada, but smaller than Made in Mexico.  If you are looking for something other than the big chains, this is the place."}
