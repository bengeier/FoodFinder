{"text":"Great restaurant with great values! I've been working for brushfire for almost a year now and it couldn't have been better. The owner and management always go the extra mile to make sure their customers and employees are cared for. Great business overall with amazing food!"}
{"text":"I'm addicted there breakfast is delicious , lunch and dinner Five Star for me , would recommend anyone to try this place out.. friendly staff and environment as well.. I come here a couple  times a week ;)"}
{"text":"Best steak tacos we ever had..tasty and big portion. The chicken tacos is kind of dry. We love to come here. Prices are very good..highly recommended"}
{"text":"My buddy loves cool architecture and could write a whole book on shipping crate homes. So when i spayed this place from the road we had to come check it out. 

Tho place is situated in the middle of a sprouts and 99 cent store parking lot. It also has the benefit or drawback (depending on how you look at it) of bring butt up again a very propular dutch bros location. No matter when you visit it is going to be busy af. 

I got the bacon breakfast burrito. The tortilla was fresh and has a nice chew and texture. The eggs cheese and bacon has a nice mix to it but it was just a little r ok salty. Maybe that becuae it had plenty of delicious bacon. My homies got the tacos and was really hyping the sauce that came with it. 

Not you are going to have to get your grub on in the car ladies and gentleman. There is no indoor denying experience so nothing much to say there. 

Looks like they have special on Tuesday for a taco and tapas $5. 

Ill be back."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place.  That being said, not sure we will be going back.  It comes down to the customer service.  Breakfast burritos available until 10:30.  We walk up to the window and wait about 3-4 minutes and finally take a closer look inside (the windows are tinted to make sure someone is really in there). There weren't any cars in the drive thru and no one else outside..  We must have gotten their attention, a girl opens the window and says oh hi, sorry about the wait... I order a breakfast burrito and she tells me, oh we stopped making those about 2 minutes ago.... I nicely mentioned I was in line before that time, and she just repeats we stopped making those.  The end.   She seemed irritated after this so we just ordered other items off the menu.  She couldn't close that window soon enough it seemed after we ordered.  15 minutes later our order was ready.  Hopefully it doesn't take that long all the time.  I understand if it is the beginning of lunch it might take some time to get the lunch food out and prepared. Here is what we ordered and what we though of it.
Empanadas- they were ok, about 4x3 so pretty tiny but they are only 2.49.  I don't think they were homemade there, but nonetheless, the crust was flaky.
Croquetas- we didn't like them.  Not crispy, kinda mushy.
Al Pastor burrito- Best Al Pastor we have ever had.  
Carne Asada- It was ok, comparable to Chipolte.

4 stars for the Al Pasor
1 star for the service
3 stars overall."}
{"text":"So amazing!!! LOVE LOVE LOVE.  I have driven over 40 miles twice juust to eat here!  I hope the open another location in the west valley very soon."}
{"text":"Let me say that I shop frequently in this area and have always wondered how this place was.   A friend and I decided to check it out.  So glad we did (and I have been back 3 times in the past week).

They have a drive-thru, but we decided to park and use the walk up window.  Service was great, just wish I could remember the cashiers name (he was very personable).

The food..........OMG..there are now words for me.  I'm in love!!  I got the steak taco (with the guac or pico as I'm not a fan of jalapenos).   Steak was wonderfully season, a little queso added and I opted for a corn tortilla.  I am hooked.  Also got an order of their tortilla chips...so tasty.  They make them right there daily and season them with fresh lime juice and little salt.  Excellent. 

Can't wait to try something else on the menu, but I am so addicted to those tacos!!!"}
{"text":"Breakfast Bacon Taco is good the burrito needed more flavor but was a decent size. Taco was a little skimpy. Overall it tasted good. Will come back to try Lunch."}
{"text":"EXCELLENT TACOS!! My first vist, this place is friendly and the food was great. They even have a fountain outside that keeps the atmosphere under the tent cool. Good location next to a Coffee shop that has great coffee and the help speaks great english and doesn't get mad becuase you're white. Drive thru so yea I love this place already!!"}
{"text":"Brushfire is a small outside seating. Drive-through spot with big flavor my favorite go to breakfast place I always always always get the egg and potato burrito with no potato add pico they have this amazing spicy mayo that's just bomb bomb bomb and they have a point system and send you promotions text message what more can I ask for bushfire keep it up"}
{"text":"I DO love the food and they have some great staff- but lately the customer service has been pretty BAD. Last trip the drive through girl just couldn't get our order correct no matter how many times we tried and I was met with attitude when we finally got our burritos and they were STILL wrong! They have a rewards point system but you can't manage or check it without going there and seems like every time I've built up points and go to use them they've magically disappeared. 

Would be 5 stars if can get the service/attitudes we've experienced lately in check and work on your rewards program. I do love their spicy mayo."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now.  The pork tacos are greasy and the chicken tacos are usually cold and dry.  I would recommend the steak tacos and the croquetas. I haven't liked any of the salsas so I stopped ordering the combo meals.  They changed their loyalty program when I was two tacos away from a free one.  They said they could transfer it but instead of a punch card I would have to use their iPad mini.  It was a bummer.  I don't want to touch anything public during flu season.  The 'bertos across the street is better.  I think I will stick to it from now on."}
{"text":"I found this place on Yelp a few months back. I'm so happy that I did! I'm making my way around the menu. Every time I come I try something new. Today I had the steak fries (I didn't see it on the menu but I got a text alert about it from the restaurant). They were AMAZING! The food is definitely sit down restaurant quality. I can't believe it's coming from a drive through. The staff is always friendly. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Wow! I'm a huge fan of the Dutch Bros next door and finally decided to try out Brushfire. And thank goodness I did! This is totally going to be my taco spot. Not only were their prices fantastic the food was beyond delicious. I will definitely be coming back with my family to get some shrimp tacos!"}
{"text":"Overpriced small tacos and tapas. Very cheap with their salsas as well. There's better places for tacos here and Arizona for sure. I would not recommend this to anyone."}
{"text":"It was my first time there tonight, and it was amazing from start to the last bite!! The staff who took care of us were very pleasant and welcoming (they were busy, so I didn't get their names, but it was the walk up window around 6:50pm 4/3, it'd be nice if they were recognized for doing a fantastic job). I had the steak and pork tacos, and wow! \"momma mia\" they were so delicious! I'll definitely be back, and I'd recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"Great food, but a little pricey in my opinion for fast food style Mexican food, I personally think $23 for 2 people is a little expensive at an establishment like this. The food IS quality though & tastes great!"}
{"text":"I'm updating my previous review because some things have changed. They have added a steak breakfast burrito & taco to the menu, I'm so happy about that because I've been asking them to do that. Let me tell you, they did not disappoint. The burrito was so big I could only get my hand half way around it. This was now the second time I have gotten the burrito & so far it's consistent. The steak was very tender & no grizzle & it was loaded in the burro. It was also heaping with eggs & the spicy mayo & added pico puts it over the top. I have to note that the prices on all the burritos & tacos have increased but you get what you pay for. The burritos are now $4.29 & the tacos are $1.99. The only thing that I'm not happy about is that the sides of salsa have doubled in price, I think 50 cents is a bit high for 2 ounces of salsa, but you get your first one free with purchase."}
{"text":"Food is 4 stars good but my review is based on overall experience.  Food is way too expensive for drive-thru food. When did we start tiping people from a drive-thru?"}
{"text":"This is by far the best drive thru Mexican food I've ever had! It doesn't taste like fast food at all. They use fresh, quality ingredients. My new favorite is the burrito bowl. Amazing!"}
{"text":"Lame experience began at the order window when the young woman spoke so quickly, in such a high pitch as to be incomprehensible.  Food (pork taco & empanadas plus chips) were okay but unremarkable. (Pineapple was different & fresh)   $12 with two waters.  Won't be back.  Gotta be better Tacos somewhere around here.  Hint:  avoid taco stands patronized only by gringos."}
{"text":"Brush Fire has the best tacos in the area! The shrimp and fuego are life!! The staff is incredible!"}
{"text":"Far too pricey for what you get. Definitely go get taco Tuesday across the street or have delicious street tacos from the food truck on the other side of the freeway"}
{"text":"The food is very good and have never been disappointed. I definitely enjoy the salsa Verde and buy extra when I swing by. Down side is the parking and the never ending traffic for the coffee snobs next door to them."}
{"text":"Restaurant quality tacos on the cheap! I ordered the shrimp taco and a chicken taco and they were both great. You can definitely appreciate the fresh ingredients. You can either do the drive thru option or order up at the window and eat outside. I did not really know what to expect but I will definitely be returning! 
-I would highly recommend  this restaurant if you are looking for a fast,cheap,not greasy taco! 
ps try the Horchatta!"}
{"text":"Went today based on article in Peoria newspaper last week or so and the reasonable prices shown on their menue that I got online. Got there and the prices had been increased by a dollar per taco. Got 4 tacos anyway and went home. We got one of each except for the vegetarian. They fell apart when we tried to eat them. The flour tortillias were pretty poor and could not hold the filling. The beef, chicken and pork tacos had little flavor. The shrimp was OK. The rice was very bland, little cilantro and no lime, and the beans had little flavor. The owner has pledged to give 51% of his profits to charity which is good, but I shouldn't have to subsidize his generosity by a 50% increase in the cost of the food. We will not be going back."}
{"text":"Brushfire is a neat concept...very food truck-esque, with its drive thru and patio options 'round the small kitchen establishment. Brought here via a Groupon deal, I was excited to try the small, but interesting menu. 

Among the carne asada taco, shrimp taco and chicken empanada, the steak taco was my favorite, with great fresh toppings, including a little guac. I expected more from the shrimp taco, which was a little too seafood fragrant for my liking. I understand that frozen shrimp may be necessary for this type of place and that doesn't always mean bad! However, though the shrimp tasted fine, the smell was a little potent... also, not a fan of the slaw...wayyyyy too many carrots. No other explanation. Just odd. 

The empanada itself was good though I didn't get the lettuce dressed with some globby white substance (plain mayo?) in addition to their spicy mayo sauce (which was tasty, even for a non-mayo person). 

I've got two more $8 vouchers so I will be back, but I am not sure I'll be a frequent visitor. For the money, Rubio's is better and included the salsa bar. I do applaud this local place's effort though!"}
{"text":"Fresh ingredients and tasty food. Nice concept with the meal that includes a tapas choice, chips and great salsa choices plus a drink. 
Stopped by with friends on the way from Las Vegas to Tucson. Not far from the 101. Definitely a good choice for a quick bite while on the road."}
{"text":"Rather eat at Waldos Tacos...this place is too expensive for what you get and how long it takes to get it. I will give them thumbs up for the empanadas."}
{"text":"First time in I get tacos as the rating standard. The tacos were good however I have a couple of issues. First it took 5 minutes to get my 2 tacos. Nothing else. Just 2 tacos. And no one in front of me in line. The 2 guys inside seemed to be having a spirited conversation. 

Second is the packaging. Each taco came in its own Styrofoam container. I thought most everyone got rid of these wasteful containers. Wrap the taco in a piece of paper for goodness sake. 

I was eating the  food there. No need to give me 2 tacos in a bag. A simple cardboard tray would work. 

But as I said the food was good. But lots of wasteful packaging."}
{"text":"I've lived in the area for 4 months and I decided tonight that I wanted to try Brushfire Tacos y Tapas and I am glad that I did.  I had the Grilled Marinaded Chicken Burrito and I made it a \"Flight\".  A Flight is when you add chips, salsa, a drink and a Tapa.  The Tapa I chose was the chicken empanada.  They have 5 choices of salsas.  I went with the Brushfire which was their second most hottest.  

The service was quick and the food was absolutely excellent!!  

I highly recommend it.  And when you go, try the Horchata.  That was a first for me to.  I think that I am hooked."}
{"text":"I gave it a 5 stars rating because my husband and I are obsessed with it. Best tacos we have ever ever had. I would just recommend you guys to order online through yelp, not on their website because their website is not up to date. I ordered once on their website and they let me put my order through and when i went to get it the place was already closed and something on my order was some old recipe they don't even make anymore. So they did it again the next day and told us to order through Yelp. Just thought you guys might like to know this."}
{"text":"The steak taco was pretty good.  I REALLY wanted to like the papas bravas.  I love potatoes, but these had so much spice that I could not taste the potato.  It was about 10 x more spice than I wanted.  It was not too hot, just too much spice flavor which completely overwhelmed the potatoes and even the remaining steak taco.  It is hard to eat any of it in the car - better to wait until you have a table.

It felt overpriced.  There are several other places to eat in the neighborhood; I doubt I will go back."}
{"text":"I was anxious to write a review because I completely disagree with the one star reviews. My husband had the shrimp burrito, which was $8.67 and I had a steak burrito bowl, also $8.67. They were phenomenal! As for the comments about portion size, I can only speak for our meals and they were giant and well worth the price! The drive thru worked just fine. Our order came out exact and customer service was great! Maybe the veggie meals weren't as good, I'm not sure but we are definitely looking forward to going back!

Overall the flavor was great, it was fresh as you could see them making it behind the window and the portions (at least for our meals) were very large for the price! This place will only get busier!"}
{"text":"I went here based on other people telling me it is really good. I was not impressed. We ordered online and went to pick it up, which I think was the first issue. Our order was wrong. They forgot out churros and gave use the wrong salsa. My taco was cold. We got a steak bowl that the only good thing was the steak.  I got an empanada which was good. It was the best part. The chips in my opinion are better than Chipotle's, but doesn't make up for the small portions. Based on the other reviews I assume consistency is the issue with this place. For the same price I can get more food at Chipotle and I don't have to worry about service or quality."}
{"text":"love love LOVE this place!! We were excited to try them when we saw they were building it.. we love taking trips that way for dutch bros even though they are not that close to us it is always worth the trip!! very excited to see that they have put a deal on groupon! that just makes me want to go more often! very fresh and green love the pork taco/bowl!"}
{"text":"Imagine if Chipotle and Filiberto's had a baby, and read on!

I've been eagerly awaiting the opening of this \"shipping container restaurant\" next to Dutch Brothers on 83rd Avenue and Thunderbird Road. Anytime we can get a non mega chain in the Peoria/Glendale area, I'm the first in line. The construction on this building was slow going, and it wasn't until last night that I realized it was open, as I drove to Sprouts in the same parking lot. I am still unsure if this is a soft opening, but according to their Facebook, they've been open nearly a month. Very curious.

Let's discuss the notion of a drive thru/walk up only restaurant. I think it is entirely novel and very fitting that Brushfire Tacos y Tapas is literally steps away from Dutch Brothers. While the drive through is not yet open, the walk up window is. I love the innovative use of the storage container to house an entire restaurant, it is a way to \"upcycle\" or use something old in an innovative way. It seems almost too forward thinking for this side of town, or even this state; it's very \"Portland.\" I'm thrilled!!

Enough of the restaurant and anticlimactic opening; let's discuss the food. My boyfriend and I sampled just about every Mexican option this evening, spending nearly $30 on enough food for at least 3 people. Next time we will sample some things off of the Tapas side of the menu. I tried one of each:

Vegetable Taco- I only ate a few bites, but this was very good. The primary ingredient tasted like breakfast style potatoes with a mix of peppers, mushrooms, and salsa. It wasn't spicy, but it was flavorful and would be filling for vegetarians and non vegetarians alike.

Chicken Taco/Burrito- Pretty straightforward but still good. The chicken was somewhere in between Filiberto's and Chipotle: better quality than Filly B's, but not as flavorful or juicy as Chipotle. Basic taco with pico de gallo and cheese. My boyfriend got the Chicken Burrito which is their standard one. It's as big as a Chipotle Burrito rolled with rice, beans, guac, lettuce, pico, cilantro lime dressing, and cheese. Overall, more ingredients and flavors than a standard Chipotle burrito. He thought it was overall better than a Filiberto's chicken burrito, and almost better than Chipotle if only the rice had more flavor.

Al Pastor Taco- Warning, no Al Pastor ever satisfies me like America's Taco Shop, so it's almost a futile effort that I sample Al Pastor everywhere. The pork was fine, but had an almost unnaturally sweet pineapple flavor. I liked that they were generous with the pineapple on it though, but it tasted just like cold, canned pineapple tidbits. Just an okay taco.

Shrimp- When I unwrapped it (I live only 1/2 a mile from Brushfire) it was literally ice cold. The tortilla and filling felt like it came out of the fridge. Maybe because they put some sort of coleslaw on top, and then wrap it up. No matter, it was a cold turnoff. I only ate 1 bite, and the shrimp itself was tasty.

Side of rice/beans- The whole pinto beans were VERY tasty and to me had more flavor than Chipotle. I only wish their rice was equally good. It lacked flavor, seemed undercooked, and dry. It touts that it is cilantro lime, but you could hardly see any specks of cilantro, and if their was lime juice detectable at all, it tasted artificial.

Desserts- This is important: their desserts are AMAZING. As good of a warm churro as any you'd hope to eat. While the tacos were lukewarm at best, somehow the churro stayed hotter than anything else, and I ate it last. Very good!! I think it was supposed to come with chocolate and it didn't, but who cares?! Then there is the Espresso Flan, an unusual idea. It was delicious and unique, easily the tastiest thing we ordered from Brushfire!

So, overall I would say 3-3.5 stars for food, but due to its convenient location and novel concept I gave it 4 stars. You should definitely give Brushfire a try; as far as I know it's the first location in Arizona. I'd love to see Peoria as the home to more restaurant debuts like this! I hope they work out some of the kinks, most importantly: not overcooking rice and meats, and serving food at the proper hot temperature. So if you're look for a fast way to satisfy your taco craving that is a step up from Filiberto's, but yet not quite to the execution level of Chipotle, give Brushfire a try!"}
{"text":"Good tacos. Fast service. Very nice ppl but way too expensive. $4 for one taco!!! $8 to add chips and a drink. They are good but not that good. Just not worth it. Probably not eating there again unless I get more than one taco for that price."}
{"text":"We have been going here since they opened and recommended them to tons of friends. We even have a previous five star review. The cashier today added a 20% tip on the square reader without mentioning it and bacon burrito a couple of weeks ago didn't have a single piece of bacon on it. No response via their contact info to resolve when I tried. Please review your receipt before signing will update if owner responds this time"}
{"text":"Original but pretty bland. I really noticed the quality of the food. I got the steak burrito with brush fire sauce and it was good! It was really big in size as well."}
{"text":"Great service and a nice outdoor space to enjoy your food there.  The salsa was excellent and the tacos did not disappoint."}
{"text":"This place is addictive! Great food and friendly staff. I have tried everything on that menu and I have never been disappointed. My favorite is el pastor tacos!!! Yumm!"}
{"text":"Best Breakfast Burrito I've had so far in Peoria. 
I normally LOVE straight Mexican breakfast burritos. But I've been eating healthy lately and I tried their BEEF CHORIZO BREAKFAST BURRITO recently and I was Truly Amazed!! 
It was NOT greasy
It was perfect size and amount if eggs potatoes and chorizo and their Spicy Mayo sauce OMG Amaze!!
I will definitely go back and try more items in their Menu!! 
Bwt their service is awesome and fast"}
{"text":"Great food and customer service. Average meal price is $10 if you include a drink. (They have horchata!) The food was very good and fresh. On my first visit there was a mixup and my order was misplaced. They were quick to correct the problem and gave me a few free taco coupons for my next visit. I tried their chicken bowl, best chicken bowl I've ever had. Will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Really good fast food tacos and burritos. You can't even tell it's fast food, it tastes fresh and I've never waited for more than five minutes. The staff is great too!"}
{"text":"Since I have found brushfire, NO other Mexican restaurant can compare! All of their ingredients are fresh.....just like thier staff! :) The young girl that took my order was a ray of sunshine!! 
 Every menu choice is cooked to perfection! I totally dig the empanadas,I savored every bite dipped in the spicy mayo. All thier salsas have the Perfect Kick to them, but my favorite is the Verde....ohhh! And don't get me started on thier Horchatha!!!!! It's absolutely Heavenly,such a treat! (It's even made from scratch and with Love) 

Thank you Brushfire for feeding me!! 

Definitely a \"MUST GO!!\""}
{"text":"Visiting Phoenix and checking out Mexican food joints. Not what I expected but good none the less. The food was good, prices reasonable and outside dining or take home only. Staff was friendly. Menu selections limited but for the style of dining enough to satisfy most diners."}
{"text":"I spent $11 and got a carne asado taco, an empenada, an order of croquettas, chips and salsa, and a drink. The taco had good flavor, and I liked the queso fresco on top; the portion size wasn't huge, but the quality was excellent, especially compared to fast food places. The empenada was flaky and delicious, and the croquettas were small, but tasty. The verde salsa that came with my order was excellent. 

Next time If I  eat at Brushfire I will definitely order the \"flight\" combo again, rather than ordering items separately."}
{"text":"Went here the first time last night. I'm a broke college student, so this is normally out of my price range. Saw a groupon the other night for a sushi joint and went on to grab it, but it wasn't there anymore. I continued looking and decided on this place. 

I didn't really know what I wanted, guy at the counter immediately came over and asked. Started asking me how hungry I was, then told me to get a burrito. 

So, based on that I ordered a shrimp burrito, with a side of pinto beans and a side of rice, thinking the burrito wouldn't be that big. Damn, was I wrong. This burrito was bigger than one of Chipotle's, all in all. Tasted way better than Chipolte, though and at nearly the same price. The spicy mayo brought a nice flavor to the shrimp, the fresh veggies gave it a nice texture. It was awesome. My only qualm with it was that the shrimp was a little chewy, but it still tasted awesome. The pico had awesome flavor. The pinto beans and cilantro rice were both excellent, not sure what cheese they put on the beans, but I didn't really care for it. Would rather just have plain pintos, or if they had black beans available, that would have been even better.

The salsas were subpar, IMO. The volcano didn't have a ton of flavor and just relied on the heat, the verde... just didn't taste right.  The only other qualm I would've had, is that it was a little cold. I'm not sure if it was due to the transport time and the temp outside (it was chilly last night), but it did take me 5-10 minutes or so to get it home.

The price, I feel, was reasonable for the size. Without the groupon, it would've been around $11 (steep, but right around Chipolte). I didn't order any tacos, so I can't comment on that. Really, though, I'm a big dude at 220 lbs. I tapped out about halfway through the burrito and the sides. Felt like I couldn't take another bite, but it was so wonderfully delicious that I wanted too. I originally bought these so that I could run up during lunch on school days and bring this back, but there is so much food, no way I could finish it. So, it got DD status (designated dinner).

Edited it to add this: I think you can see where the one stars are coming from and not to avoid it, because of that. Nearly all were right at opening and obviously there has been improvement, shown by the reviews increasing as you go up."}
{"text":"Come on guys I really like you. But today 5.07.2018 @ 1;30 you were not that busy no one at the walk-up and two cars besides myself.
 You forgot my steak taco and I knew my bag didn't feel right so I checked it at the light. With more insult to injury not one napkin or a fork. It's okay I'm a male and I have pants and hands. Better luck next time for me."}
{"text":"Awesome ! Healthier options ! They are fast and if you join their club, they have great deals."}
{"text":"We drove 9 miles out of our way for a lunch.  We were not disappointed.  

The owner and staff were super friendly and I liked how they remembered my name and not just because it was on the ticket.  The owner 20 minutes after taking my order was cleaning up the outdoor sitting area and when she noticed I was going to the window to get a refill - \"Mark, let me get that for you.\"   And one of the workers also remember who I was when I went back to the order window.  Wow. See that is service.  And we liked her story behind the concept for the restaurant and its origins.  

Oh and the tacos were great too.  I went back for another one as did one of my companions.  Actually he went back for two more!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the food here. The guacamole was fresh and tasty, I had a pork Taco and it was very good. Also had some little shrimps off the tapas menu. The selection of hot sauce I really liked and I grabbed two different ones. The Brushfire one was great"}
{"text":"Mediocre food and decent service. Waited in the drive thru line for 15 min but they were very apologetic about the wait and had good customer service which is why I give it 2 starts. I got the pork taco and empanada as my tapa and it's just OK. The taco doesn't really have much flavor and the empanada is odd tasting. I just feel like the taco should have more flavor for being a taco place. This was my first time here and I'm not sure I'll be back."}
{"text":"Other than being greeted by the sassy girl with an attitude the man was educated and directed me towards my decision on the menu. The food was good and not terribly expensive."}
{"text":"Good flavor... shrimp taco seemed undercooked but they were nice to make another. Not sure if marinade  contributed to texture. Pork taco yummy could use more pineapple. Steak tacos great. Papas with spicy mayo were excellent! Very friendly great service!"}
{"text":"I just visited for the first time a week or two ago. I thought the food was good, but was somewhat unimpressed. You pay quite a lot for portions that aren't that big. You also wait a fairly long time for your food. I think I definitely prefer Chipotle for taste and even value, but I think the food here seems more authentic."}
{"text":"This place has great tacos. Sometimes they have $2 taco days. Don't miss those. 

Their breakfast burritos are good. All of them. Do not skip them. 

The pork taco is only ok. When I had it, it was very overcooked. 

The chicken tacos are yummy. They have juicy pieces of chicken with lettuce & pico de gallo, and guacamole. 

The carne asada here is super good. I have no idea if it's \"authentic\", but it's super tasty. I've never had it overcooked. 

My favorite thing here is the steak bowl. It's steak with rice & pinto beans, lettuce, pico de gallo, carne asada and I think roasted poblanos. It's been a little while since I've had one. 

The wings have a great spicy sweet sauce. If they were a bit cheaper I'd get them more. 

The fiery shrimp has breaded shrimp with the same sauce. So good. 

The chicken empanada is good. It comes with lettuce & sour cream, and a spicy mayo to dip it in. The chicken is mildly spiced, with flecks of black pepper in it. It's literally just stuffed with chicken, but if they changed it, I wouldn't get it anymore."}
{"text":"It's good. 
Had this for the first time. And it's good. Could be better. Not \"street\" tacos like I have in Mexico but it's an American attempt at it. Much fancier than street tacos with the grilled veggies and flour tortillas instead of corn. The rice was nasty. The empanadas are not authentic, I wouldn't recommend them. The horchata was ok, nothing special the pico salsa was lacking flavor.  But the inferno salsa was devine! I put that on everything and it kicked it up a notch. It had me on fire  
Overall it's good. Nothing special, I wanna try the burritos next time with a groupon. My husband didn't like that they pack their tacos individually, we got 10 tacos in 10 separate styrofoam containers. Kinda not green in that way."}
{"text":"Came back after just a couple of days, it's that good :)  Got the croquetas this time. 6 small ham and cheese fried balls of deliciousness dipped in spicy sauce. Also had the cilantro lime rice....it's a winner!"}
{"text":"Unique place. We went  through the drive thru, and had to repeat everything 3 times. Its pretty expensive, but pretty good. The spicy mayonnaise sauce is very good. The shrimp tacos are very good."}
{"text":"This place is ok at best, I think that most of it buiness is probably generated that it's fast non chain Mexican food through a drive thru. But overall the novelty of it does not extend over the mediocre food. Been here twice and wasn't blown away either time. Worth checking out if your bored with all other \"fast\" but this more than likely won't be a place you go out of your way to visit."}
{"text":"This place was tasty. That's the only thing they had going for them. Portions are ridiculously small for the price. Pretty sure I didn't order off of the kids meal... Took 20 minutes to get my order. For $10 I got 2 tacos 1 empenda, a tiny soda that was gone before I got my food and chips and salsa... Oh wait... When I got to work I found out they forgot my chips. What a waste of space. Zero stars if I could."}
{"text":"Brushfire has the BEST breakfast burritos in the valley hands down! Their tacos and tapas are the bomb as well!! Go give it a try seriously the best no joke!!!"}
{"text":"Brushfire is one of my family and I's favorite place to get tacos, its definitely one of the best we have found in the Phoenix area! The brushfire and verde salsa is amazing. The breakfast burritos/tacos are also super delicious! Everything we have had here hasn't disappointed us. We live 25 minutes away and don't mind driving, but wish there was one closer!! Bring one to Goodyear!  We love Brushfire!!"}
{"text":"I was excited to try this Drive Through Tacos & Tapas place, but was a little disappointed. 3 steak tacos and rice were almost $10 and for street taco size, not very filling for my husband- but they were tasty. 

I had a chicken taco with verde sauce that was good (and definitely better than Taco Bell) but I had to add a $2.50 chicken empanada and a $3 fried ham croquette order. The chicken empanada was very good and was perfectly cooked. The croquettes, however, we're very small and mushy.

I liked the concept but for street tacos, I would expect them to be lower priced. I can get 3 tacos from a standard brick and mortar Mexican restaurant for $10 and not walk away hungry - but the drive through convenience is nice."}
{"text":"It was our first time here. Great food! The pork bowl was amazing with tender pork and a hint of sweet from pineapple bits. The weather was great, so the patio was nice with a live band."}
{"text":"Tacos are good and I like the salsa selection. Problem is they are the size of street tacos that cost probably twice as much as they are worth. Very good but not worth the price."}
{"text":"Very good food for on the go. Price is reasonable. Flavor is good. Tapas are great. Never seem to wait that long, and line is usually short."}
{"text":"Their tacos are fresh and full of flavor.  Although I love their bowls, my husband didn't particularly like them.  He prefers the Tacos.   They have quick service and a little outdoor dining area that is best suited for cooler nights.  The only reason I couldn't give them five stars is because their service is not consistent.  One day we will get exceptional service and the other we will get someone who sees we are standing there and don't acknowledge us.  If their customer service was consistent they would earn five stars."}
{"text":"i had the shrimp, carne, and fish... very disappointed. priced way too high. taco tuesday at Filibertos off Glendale and Litchfield. A+ rating for cleanliness, service, and food."}
{"text":"I love Brushfire! I go there on the regular for breakfast burritos and tacos! It's the bomb! sometimes I roll there for a light 1 taco, rice and beans dinner and then get a Redbox to unwind. Sometimes when I show up to work w/ my brown bag breakfast from Brushfire, I be like \"This some good gourmet s*#t right here!!...go get you Sum!\"  - Fo real :D"}
{"text":"OMG! I've been wanting to go here for a while. We finally went today and I had the taco bowl. My husband have a chicken burrito. We got a side of the brushfire salsa.All I can say is I can't wait to go back. Our food was amazing! Love love loved it!"}
{"text":"This place needs a warning label. The flight means your stomach is going to be screaming for a break. That is a lot of food! The flight includes a drink, chips and salsa, an entree and a side tapas. It might be because I ordered the bowl. I'm not sure how large the burritos or tacos are.  I don't know if I ate the food in the wrong order, or if I just shouldn't of eaten all of it. Make sure you ask all of what is in the bowl. The menu board is not clear and you'll be wondering what's on top. The bowl container is a lot deeper than you think it is and which makes this a heavy \"salad\".  I enjoyed it, but next time I'll just order the bowl and the papas fritas or the bowl with the chips and salsa. Oh yeah, the Papas fritas are great so you might want to save those for last or you might want to not want to eat the rest of your meal because you'll be thinking about eating more of those."}
{"text":"Update: I have been back several times. There is no question that their food is delicious. Before I gave a three star review primarily because of cold breakfast burritos. They have since redeemed themselves. Hot food every time. Amazing bacon egg breakfast burritos! Delicious chorizo breakfast burritos. Friendly service.They have also updated their tech for the loyalty program. No more punch cards.

I only have one question if you are eating food someplace else....

Why?"}
{"text":"took 20 minutes to get my food and all I ordered was 2 tacos. Got home and realized that the tacos weren't even the ones I ordered. It took a long time and I was dissatisfied with the quality by the time I opened it it wasn't even very hot anymore. Do not recommend"}
{"text":"I really want to like this place because the service is very good...sadly the quantity and quality of the food is not...seems like I'm being up sold too.
The chicken taco was very dry and not big enough for a lunch portion on its own...had to add on the empanada to make it a \"meal\". Empanada was tasty enough but served on a bed of lettuce seemed uninspired. Was charged for chips and salsa too.
$8 for this lunch was too much"}
{"text":"Their breakfast burritos are by far the best around, but I wish they had them available to order all day. The tacos are great too, but don't stand out the way the breakfast burritos do!"}
{"text":"Food poisoning, I had a chicken taco and a beef taco, guts HURT!!! Long wait for food, super loud from all the cars, NO indoor seating HOT! , and TERRRRRIBLE exhaust smell from all the cars going by..."}
{"text":"I've had their breakfast and lunch on a few occasions, both are delicious. I would recommend getting a burrito instead of a taco to get more for your money that's the only negative."}
{"text":"I am obsessed with Brushfire, my husband says I might turn into it lol, I highly recommend papas bravas with the spicy mayo! Yum!!! I actual buy the spicy mayo for my eggs at breakfast at home its great!  I haven't had anything here that I didn't like!  But let me tell you why I really come back, the people who work here are AWESOME, I am sorry I don't know everyone by name but everyone is always so nice to chat with, tonight Ricardo was working in the window he is always so customer service focused, Brushfire is so lucky to have the great employees they do!! Thanks for the fantastic service!!"}
{"text":"Concept and service are great, but the food was mediocre.  Omitted from the rating was the fact that they were closed for unknown reasons (during normal business hours) the previous two times when I tried to try before.  Hoping it wasn't health code related.."}
{"text":"I decided to use the walk up window instead of the busy drive thru. I waited 5 minutes before being served. The girl who ran the window was greetful. My name was called to pick up the food and I had to wait behind a customer who was ordering so my food sat there for a while before I helped. I chose the veggie & chicken tacos which were soggy,bland and with a boring unvariety vegetables."}
{"text":"I just saw this groupon and thought I would be adventurous and try out this place. My experience with AZMEX has been a very unpleasant experience so I am reluctant to try new mexican food places because of this. This place was a pleasant surprise. The food and ingredients seem to be freshly prepared and have robust flavor. The place is a little bit pricey for the items they offer but then again if you want fresh tasting that is understandable. My only complaints is for the silly thing I see a lot of AZ restaurants doing and that is charging for refills. Why nickle and dime. I'm not going to pay 20% of the full price of the drink cause I am thirsty from sitting outside in the heat. Just make sure that when you go that you plan to go when it is cooler cause there is only outdoor seating and drive thru. I felt like I was eating at a Mexican taco shop eating outside. Overall I recommend to try this place as I think it is far better than the lard laden restaurants like Carolina's that so many people love. No comparison. Do yourself a favor and try this place."}
{"text":"I just got a steak taco. A la carte.  It cost $4.02 and was standard size. The carne was good with guacamole and cheese. Dinners were $8 ish came with a lot of stuff and drink a much better economic deal"}
{"text":"Thanks to Hope B., I received an immediate reply from Hope to correct their oversight.  It is my birthday this week & I have not received my notice for a free taco.  But, that is not going to stop us from coming by to eat Brushfire's great fish tacos.  My husband will get his belated free birthday taco.  Hope I receive mine.  Crossing my fingers.  Love their tacos!!!"}
{"text":"My family ate here on Sunday afternoon.  We sat outside at one of the two shaded tables.  It was super hot outside, but I tried to not let it bother me. I thought it was a bit too expensive for the quantity of food and the location.  As for the food itself:

Chicken taco with verde salsa: dry chicken, lacked flavor, but it was all white meat which I appreciate

Shrimp en fuego: battered deep fried shrimp, really good

Chips and guacamole: there were at least two chunks where 20 chips had all stuck together in a giant stack, and the guac had zero flavor

Empanada: really good.  Sometimes empanadas get tough but this one was flaky and delish

It is a convenient location, but I won't go back unless someone else initiates."}
{"text":"Right next to my favorite Dutch Bros so I wanted to give this place a shot. I got 4 tacos because people said they were really small and they were actually. I was still hungry after 4 and I'm an average sized male. Kinda felt sad because that was like 15$ right there. So I didn't wanna get more. The tacos are amazing the pricing is a little high for the small size. Still a good place to eat at."}
{"text":"Just ate here after a visit to the gym and I am completely thrilled with the food. I got chicken tacos, cilantro and lime rice as well as salsa and chips. The portions were smaller than what you'd get at other places but that's fantastic if you ask me! Americans overeat to a frightening degree and a place that serves high quality fast food that's healthy!? Sigh me up!

Chicken was all white, tender and tasty with a white cheese crumbled on top. It came with pico which I got on the side. The salsa (I got two fire) was pleasantly hot, left a nice burning tingle for a few seconds after eating it but didn't make me want to run for a glass of milk, just how I like it. The unsweetened tea I got was good too, too often when I buy it it's really watered down but no problem here!

I would highly recommend this to anyone and everyone with the warning of 'smaller portions, slightly expensive but you're money is going towards quality not quantity!'"}
{"text":"This is a review of their newer menu items. 

Fish taco - I was expecting fried fish but this is REAL grilled fish served with cabbage and sauce.  It reminded me of legit fish tacos I've eaten in San Diego. Brushfire's fish taco sets the bar high. 

Fuego wings - meaty wings, nice sweet and spicy sauce. As a bonus I received 5 wings instead of 4 that are listed on the menu. Definitely worth the $1 upcharge on the meal."}
{"text":"I just had the worst customer service experience I've ever had in my entire 30 years of life. I have never in my entire life left a review for anywhere but this was so bad I have to let someone at this place know about how rudely I was treated. Me and my husband ordered 6 tacos, I requested wildfire sauce on mine. And we also requested limes. They forgot our limes like always, so I walked up to the window and asked for limes, the girl  gave them to me, didn't even apologize for forgetting something so simple. Every single time we come here which has been about 7 or 8 times, they forget the Limes we always ask for so of course they did this time too. But today, they also made my 3 tacos which i requested wildfire sauce on them with no sauce. So I walked up the window and asked them for a refund because I didn't want to deal with the headache of them messing up my order again. The manager, a Hispanic guy was extremely rude, he was smiling the entire time I was voicing my complaints and concerns over the fact that they repeatedly mess up my order. He then interrupted me and asked if he could take the person behind me's order without even offering a solution to my issue. You seriously have an upset customer, and your asking to brush her off so u can help out someone else instead. These people can care less if they make your order correctly right or not. They charge ALOT, 30 bucks for 6 tacos so yes I do expect my order to be correct but obviously these people especially the rude manager don't care at all. Please everyone reading this, save yourself the headache and go to Mcdonalds or Filibertos across the street. At least they practice customer service at those places."}
{"text":"Although we arrived at closing time, we were still waited on.
the staff couldn't of been friendlier.
I had the veggie taco. it was tasty grilled mushrooms, onions green peppers on a flour tortilla, more like a mini burro instead of a taco. The espresso flan was a small serving and way to coffee strong in flavor. My husband had the chicken taco, not much flavor to it. I am sure once they get the hang of it, food will improve. It is  a convenient spot.
I think it would be best for them to expand their hours on Saturday till at least 11:30 p.m. I witnessed folks turned away in drive thru."}
{"text":"Not a fan at all .. tried pork tacos. Tried 2 of the tapas not a fan .. salsa ok at beast. Not worth it . Customer service was great though"}
{"text":"For a small stand-alone shop I was expecting very good value for the money. I don't set a rating until I've been there at least twice. 2  steak tacos couldn't feed my 44 pound 7 year old and when I asked him why he said the flour tortilla is is hard and crispy and there's not enough meat.  Sure enough there must have been 6 maybe 7 little pieces of meat, and for some reason the tortilla was hard and broken. Come on, even my 7 year old knows flour tortillas should be soft and supple. These should be called street tacos and cut the tortilla size to 4 inches because that's all the meat that fits in it

I ordered fish tacos and I couldn't find the fish in the damn thing. There's a picture you decide for yourself where the hell the fish is. Absolutely pathetic, so this place gets two stars and they should be happy with that. However based on other reviews I will stop by for a breakfast burrito or tapas just to try something else out. But for now, their steak taco sucks and their fish taco is even worse. Simply not worth the money they're asking for."}
{"text":"Great coquetas served with spicy mayo. We tried salsa verde with the chips. We used an $8 Groupon. We paid $3 for the Groupon. Instead of $26 we paid $21. We ordered 2 chicken, 2 carne asada and 2 carnitas tacos. We liked the pineapple with the carnitas. I had horchata also. A delicious meal!"}
{"text":"Brushfire Tacos Y Tapas is so fresh and delicious. They're chicken burritos are perfect. The chicken is grilled to perfection, the rice to bean to meat ratio is on point. 

Honestly, maybe like 3 years ago I would have picked chipotle over brushfire but now I'm never going to chipotle again. 

at Brushfire, they don't make food.. they're making history."}
{"text":"I love this place. It's not like any other fast food place... Their stuff is fresh! The chicken tacos are my favorite. I find myself craving them quite often lol. Their bacon breakfast burritos are good, too! If you're looking for spicy, try the inferno salsa. It's amazing!"}
{"text":"BEST. TACOS. I also love their breakfast burritos! They're heavenly! The staff is always super friendly and genuine! I love how authentic everything is! Their tortillas are amazing and so are the chips! Everything is good. Just trust me."}
{"text":"Can not top the bacon breakfast burrito with brushfire salsa. The creamy, slightly spicy sauce that is in there makes it unique and us wanting more!! Ive had other items from the menu but the breakfast burrito is my favorite!"}
{"text":"My favorite, favorite place to get a vegetarian burrito! Staff is always so friendly. Too bad that every time I'm here, I'm arguing with traffic due to the people in line for Dutch blocking the drive thru. Every. Time."}
{"text":"Brushfire has some of the best burritos, especially their breakfast burritos.  You get your choice of salsas, and all of them are excellent."}
{"text":"Good steak salad. Small for $9. Good quality steak and fresh stuff. Better than any fast food. Beats Chipotle for actual \"healthy \" Mex fusion. Expensive as a sit down restaurant nice outdoor with water misters was ok at 100 degrees."}
{"text":"I was so impressed with the chicken tacos and the shrimp en fuego! Super flavorful and fresh and the staff was friendly! The only downside was my to go bag was falling apart from the leaking sauces"}
{"text":"Well - I went off the reviews and oh boy...what on earth are you people thinking.  Tried the chorizo burrito and that was the worst burrito I have ever tasted.  No flavor just heat from the salsa.  The salsa was crap too.  Save your money and go across the street to Filibertos."}
{"text":"Great food at great prices. I work down the street from this place and it is super convenient. 

Service is fast, always use drive thru. If you're a coffee lover, Dutch Brothers is conveniently located in the same parking lot. The rewards system is pretty cool too."}
{"text":"Best Tacos in town! Their brushfire sauce is amazing. The breakfast bowls and burritos are also delicious. I haven't tried a thing there that I didn't like."}
{"text":"Soooo slow. We waiting 25 minutes for 2 tacos, and 1 burrito. We finally got it, and I opened my tacos and there was no bacon and it has the Chipotle sauce all over it when I asked for it to be on the side. Delicious tacos, need a little bit more speed and precision!"}
{"text":"When I am looking for a healthy quick lunch, I go through the drive through and order steak tacos with brush fire salsa or the steak bowl no rice.  Both are excellent. Plenty of steak in both. I do wish their large drinks were larger.  Service has always been friendly.  You might wait a couple minutes longer but worth the wait!"}
{"text":"How I have never tried this little drive through taco shop before, I have no idea. I had heard of Brushfire Tacos, but I definitely put it in the Filibertos category of drive-thru's. Not the case. The steak burrito was big, full of flavor, and the steak was pretty tender. The Chorizo Taco was so good! For 1.99 I got a flower taco stuff full of Chorizo, potatoes, eggs, and spiced mayo. The spice in that mayo is no joke. I suggest getting it on the side the first time around. It took me 2 days to finish my food. Next time I'll stick to a taco. It was plenty."}
{"text":"Met the owner today,  she was the cashier.  You have to respect a owner that takes pride,  and will work at her business.  She was just lovley.  Never have I been here and ever had a rude person.  They are always friendly with a smile on their face.  I still get annoyed with DB, their patrons just dont get it.  Stop blocking the driveway.  However the food is totally worth it!!"}
{"text":"I love this place for lunch and dinner. Fresh ingredients with its own flavor. The cilantro-lime dressing is super good, I always ask for some on the side to use. 

I'm not a big fan if the breakfast burritos which is why I gave it 4 stars but they are passable."}
{"text":"We love this restaurant! We come for the breakfast burritos at least once a week, sometimes more. Their taco meals are also pretty great, and they're very generous with their chips. Great customer service and food, we're here all the time."}
{"text":"I found my favorite Mexican food finally. 
Went here Friday night and came back Saturday for lunch. I told the manager that I'd see him tomorrow."}
{"text":"Amazing! No seriously if you're a vegetarian try their veggie tacos. They're really amazing and delicious. A bit pricey but for how good the food is it is worth it"}
{"text":"Really tasty, fresh tacos! Their pico is amazing whether accompanying some delicious carne asada or in one of their amazing breakfast burritos. Empenadas a flaky and not greasy in the least. 
Service has consistently been fast and very friendly. A tiny spot that could be easy to miss - but don't!"}
{"text":"I had the bacon breakfast burrito. It was smaller then a typical drive through Mexican burrito, but was slightly cheaper. The salsa rated 4 peppers was not that hot, so next time I'd go with the hottest one. I normally don't like mayonnaise, but the spicy mayo was actually pretty good. Overall,  not bad."}
{"text":"I will never come here again. I ordered food from here all the time but yesterday my boyfriend ordered a shrimp burrito and found a piece of a WIRE in his food! How does that even happen? Im so disgusted and curious what else they put in our food. Not only is it gross, but so dangerous. He's lucky it didn't cut up his gums or even worse, swallow it."}
{"text":"Such excellent service, even after 10 mins the lady at the window was able to recall my name. 
Ordered steak burrito had inferno salsa with it. Excellent food. I would definitely eat here again and would recommend it to my friends and family."}
{"text":"I will eat your empanadas all day. They are divine. I assumed your tacos were as well but I've tried two now and I have to ask. Are the  flour tortillas not heated up at all? I loved the shrimp inside my shrimp taco and the fish inside my fish taco (purchased on different days) but both times, the tortillas that held the sublimely delicious inside ingredients, were cold. Like they were not warmed at all. I have never had a taco that came cold on the outside like that before. I had a breakfast taco once and it was hot so I don't know if that is just the way you serve your regular tacos or did I just have two instances where the cook was in a super big hurry??"}
{"text":"What do you get a Yelp'er for Christmas? Groupons and gift cards of course!

Over the Holidays I received a bunch of Groupons from friends and family. I was one happy camper because each gift was for a different restaurant I hadn't visited. As I would say, nice!

Brushfire Taco Y Tapas had been on my to do list for a while, but I always thought it was a takeaway with a small dinning room. It's not, it's a drive-thru with some concrete outdoor seating. Now remember that if you come here after sundown.  LOL

The food was very good, bordering on amazing. We liked their Carne Asada burrito the best and their spicy inferno salsa was to die for. It was so good you wish they could have served it as Gazpacho Andaluz soup. I would rate it 7 on a ten scale for heat. Delicious. 

As you can see from the photos, we had more than enough food for the three of us. Expect to pay $10 to $15 each for some very good Spanish inspired Mexican food. And, don't forget to order their tasty huge (photo)Tapas.  I was told they were thinking of opening a location in Scottsdale. Yes!

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I'm totally bummed to have to give such a low rating.  The guy working the counter was so friendly (extra star for him) & I had really high hopes.  I was craving tacos so my husband & I decided to try this place, we've passed it going to Dutch Bro's often & had been wanting to visit.  I ordered 1 chicken taco & 1 steak taco, he ordered 1 pork & 1 steak.  It was almost $15 for our order, which I'd usually be more than happy to pay for good tacos but not for this size & the quality of these.  The meat was so dry in my husbands pork tacos that he couldn't even eat it, the steak tacos we both got were okay, meat was dried out, decent flavor but it was just coated in guacamole, that's all we were really getting in each bite.  Chicken taco was my absolute least favorite, no flavor at all & once again, super dry, I couldn't finish it. 

I don't know if it was just an off night or what but I'm sad to say I don't think we will be coming back to find out."}
{"text":"First impressions are everything, and this place killed it. I tried the Fuego Wings and Chicken taco. Absolutely wonderful. The food was delicious and the presentation of the taco was well above my expectations. The ingredients seemed fresh and the staff was friendly and attentive. I will be coming back for sure."}
{"text":"Tasty food.. but I felt the tacos were overpriced.. the croquettes are super yummy and the only reason I'd  go back"}
{"text":"Bought a groupon for this place and was so pleased with the food. Shrimp tacos were amazing. Tastes gourmet for an order counter place. Looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"Great food, fresh and tasty. The tacos are overstuffed and the salsas are delicious. They have a rewards program.  Sign up for texts to get specials."}
{"text":"Very flavorful. Shrimp taco is tasty! I did the drive thru. It's a wslk-up place in Lowe's parking lot."}
{"text":"Sit outside.... It s ok during cool months in Phoenix . Prices I would say high for that typo of food! 3 tacos and a soda about $12, so might as well to go to nice restaurant. Besides, tacos or burritos are COLD. 
Not sure if I try this place again!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place.  It's really good and pretty inexpensive compared to most.  Their breakfast tacos are really good!  The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is the parking lot and drive through is super frustrating.  All the crazy Dutch Brothers customers cost you a star.  Figure out how to crowd control that establishment and you'll get 5 stars from us."}
{"text":"So good! Chicken, shrimp and fish tacos are my favorite. The rice and salsas are great. My entire family loves it his place."}
{"text":"Believe it or not 4 stars.  This was probably my fourth visit here & least enjoyable.  Since all the other visits were so great, I graded higher.

Tiny lil place made of shipping containers.  My complaint today was overly chewy chips.  Also, the chips were caked with salt.  They tasted stale & I was given diet coke.  I didn't notice until almost home.

Ok the part where I can be positive.  Fresh food & friendly staff.  I love the verde & brushfire salsa.  Yesterday I tried the potato croquets & they were pretty good.  Hot as hell so I know they're fresh.  Then my shrimp taco was yummy as well.  Shrimp was spicier that expected but I still loved out.

In the past I've tried the beans, friend shrimp & potatoes.  None of them let me down.  They were all fresh cooked & really delicious.  

I love this \"sit down\" restaurant quality from this cute little drive thru place with only outside seating."}
{"text":"This place was very disappointing.   I got there as they opened and excited for fresh, delicious food based on reviews.  I must saw the service was good and the employees were very friendly.   However, that's where the good stopped.  I ordered the steak flight meal.  For my side, I chose the cilantro lime rice and it came with 1 steak taco, chips with salsa, and a regular soda.  The first thing I tried was the rice and boy was it bland and very mushy.  The majority of it was so mush iy was in a big ball of goo.  Now on to the taco.  I immediately could tell that it was cold, the tortilla was not previously warmed and made for a terrible meal.  80% of the meat was fatty nd could not be chewed thru.  The guacamole was brown tinged and definitely seemed it was from days prior.  Blaaahh!!!  On to the chips, there can't possibly be anything wrong with them right?!?  WRONG!  The chips were even stale and not crisp at all.  This visit was a big fat fail.  I would never return.  Mind you that this place is not cheap.  My meal was $8.65 for junk!!  It was so disappointing!!  Hopefully,  if you venture to try this place you will have a better experience and some fresher food!"}
{"text":"Update: tacos are awesome. But still expensive.  They are bigger than I thought they would be at least. The salsas are tasty too. Yum !"}
{"text":"Not the best experience... went through the drive thru and ordered 2 burritos, one empanada and a quesadilla. Get home and it's someone else's order of 4 tacos. Return to the shop, went to the window this time and they had remade the order I originally placed. Get home and instead of 2 burritos is 2 tacos, no quesadilla and instead of empanada I had wings in the bag. Unreal."}
{"text":"Meh... Over priced, and lack of flavor. Saw the good reviews on Yelp and figured it was worth a try. Also figured with small menu and being drive through it would be hard to mess up. It was disappointing, meat seemed overcooked, and lacking flavor. We only tried the tacos, maybe some day we may go back and try the burritos but it won't be a first choice on our list."}
{"text":"Went here on a friend's recommendation.  Very fresh and good tasting.  I could a bowl of the croquetas!!  It is a bit pricey, but you aren't getting taco bell tacos haha!  Wish they had a taco tuesday or thursday deal!  If they do, please let me know and I will see you there!"}
{"text":"Steak taco, chicken taco, empenada, crochetas. 

Was a bit disappointed by the tacos, I expected bolder layers but then when cooking for the public it's hard to really indulge as one would otherwise. I am pretty sure the chef pulled a punch or two on these and would like to know what he would do them when cooking for himself.

Empenada was outstanding. Can't say enough.

Crochetas were one of those rare experienceso that teach you something new, really quite amazing. Layers were just right, varied and bold, I loved them. The star of the show if you know what you are looking for. Great job chef.

Service was friendly, people there are just great.

Particularly love the architecture. Shipping containers. Just brilliant. Looks cool AF and Earth friendly."}
{"text":"This is a small semi/fast casual free standing taco & tapas shop in the middle of a busy parking lot. They have OUTDOOR DINING ONLY. You order either threw the drive threw or the walk up window. 

Some things were better than other things.

We shared a variety of things.

The chicken empanada was tasty and out of the tacos I tried I liked the vegetable one best because it had the most flavors and textures. I didn't try the shrimp taco but my husband liked that one the best.

The chicken and steak tacos were kind of meh and had little flavor.

The fish taco was awful and tasted fishy. They need to remove that one from the menu.

The side order of beans was just like beans in water. I don't know if this is the way they normally make it but if it is they need a new recipe for beans. I do note that the place had only kids working there on our visit. I don't know if it's that way all the time.

Service wasn't the best. We ordered a side of guacamole that was ignored and when we got our sack of food it was missing utensils and napkins. My husband had to go back and wait in line to get forks.

I would still recommend going here instead of something like a taco bell but just be prepared that this isn't the best."}
{"text":"This is place is SO good!  I work down the block and come here almost every time I'm working.  Super tasty!"}
{"text":"I could've sworn I had a review on this place. Holy cow I couldn't wait to come home and have a burrito from here again. My first time was over 6 months ago. I got a chorizo burrito and man does it taste good! You pay a good price for a huge burrito. You can also get tacos there. This last time that I went like a week ago I got the shrimp burrito and I got their brush fire sauce. The first time I can't remember what sauce I got. But I do know that the brush fire sauce tastes bomb. I can typically only eat about half of the burrito and then I have to save the rest for later. Oh and this place is like a Dutch bros except for burritos. It's a drive through and then theirs a little sitting area outside like Dutch bros has. So it's kinda cool. If you live in the area, you have your breakfast from here and your coffee from Dutch bros. It's literally the perfect spot for this place. The people are really nice too. Literally my stomach is grumbling thinking of this place right now. One of my favorite places and a definite try."}
{"text":"If I was just reviewing tapas I would give a much better review but I've tried quite a few things on the menu and everything but the tapas is sub par. I've tried chicken pork and beef taco and every time the meat is always overcooked and they just aren't that flavorful. I tried a side of rice and beans this week and it was so bland and blah, I didn't take more than 3 bites before throwing it out.
Tapas on the other hand is good and could be great if it was consistent. I've had the croquettas a number of times because when they're good, they amazing but 3 or 4 times they have tasted like nothing. 
Service has always been pretty good, everyone is always super friendly and wait times don't seem to be that bad. The one time I did call my order in, the sides of salsa and sour cream were left out. 
Its a great concept, I just wish the tacos, rice and beans were better because this could be such a simple solution to those nights where coming up with an idea for dinner seems nearly impossible."}
{"text":"Let's just say after the visit we came back 4 times the same day! It's amazing, food is delicious, great quality and amazing service! Their portions are big so it's definitely filling. Owner is so humble."}
{"text":"I have never been here before even though I pass by it often, I recently purchased a fundraiser card that Brushfire had a discount on, and decided to give it a try. I got a steak breakfast burrito. OMG this place is Awesome!!! This is the best breakfast burrito I have ever had, it has tons of cut up steak, spicy mayo, eggs, crispy potatoes. It was delicious, my only regret is that I've been passing by this place for so many years. I will definitely be telling my friends about this joint, and will be making this my regular morning burrito spot. Looked like they had a bunch of other stuff I'm excited to try."}
{"text":"I never knew food from a drive-thru could taste so fresh! The Northwest side of the Valley has lacked a great street taco place...and Brushfire fills that void amazingly while also being a great addition to the other quality Mexican restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"I don't know what all the fuss is about their tacos being too small! They are standard taco size.... And I had more than enough food! I ordered the combo which comes with one taco, chips and salsa, a drink, and one tapas. I was stuffed! They give you plenty of chips and a large container of salsa. I got the salsa verde which was delicious- I could drink that stuff. For my tapas I got the papas Fritas which were also very yummy! They came with a spicy mayo. I got the chicken taco which was good. It had a really authentic Mexican taste and had plenty of guacamole. The chicken itself was super flavorful. All of this was $8.19. Next time I'm going to try the shrimp!"}
{"text":"I got a Groupon for this place and I'm so happy I did. This place has great food!! I keep trying different items and really like each one. I don't like a lot of heat, but I do love the spicy mayo and the Brushfire salsa."}
{"text":"Groupons should introduce you to a new place with a discount in order to get you to try a new (or favorite) place. That's why I found myself at the drive thru this morning. Two steak and egg breakfast burritos I was glad I took the opportunity to try them. Their burritos are bigger than McDs and not quite as huge as Filiberto's.  A good size, well wrapped in a flour tortilla with a generous amount of filling and at a fairly reasonable price. They are located next to Dutch Bros Coffee and you can find it a challenge to get near Brushfire at 930 in the morning!  The service was reasonably fast but, most of all, I was warmly greeted and the food was very satisfactory.  I am still out on the \"secret sauce\"-it had a little kick but not overbearing.  No doubt I will be back to try their lunch menu soon. I feel like this was a great deal and a worthwhile stop. McD's is right across the street in case you need something to wash the food down and are not a coffee drinker!!."}
{"text":"Awesome burritos! Chorizo breakfast burrito is my favorite! Employees are amazing as well! I've been coming here for months after I get out of work in the morning! One morning my car battery died and my car was stuck in the drive thru- yes in the drive thru, with a line of cars behind me. Without hesitation, one of the male employees came running out, pushed my car out of the drive thru, helped me try to jump it! Unfortunately I needed a whole new battery and had to call for a tow truck but the staff came and checked on me while I waited for over an hour! Awesome food, above and beyond service!! :)"}
{"text":"I really like this place, the staff are so polite and happy here, and like that they offer a taco Tuesday deal. I also like how close to home it is, and can eat here often. My first visit I got a fish, shrimp, and chicken taco. Shared w my man and he loved it too. My second visit (today) I got a fish and shrimp taco, I was upset with my fish today bc it was SO salty I could hardly eat it. I ended up pulling some out of taco. I'm not sure if I need to order it differently or if it's a matter of who's cooking, bc my first fish wasn't nearly this salty. I will come back, but would more often if I knew I was going to get a fish taco I love like the first time."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! Could of checked in for the 38th time by now. I've nearly had it all and always get the wings as a side and inferno salsa and chips! You simply can't go wrong with this place. 

My only suggestion... I can tell you bake your wings because the skins not always crispy. Please fry them! Or better yet for simplicity, bake then flash fry for the crisp! 

(I'll take a pic next time.. I couldn't resist eating really fast)

PS.. Drive through girl last, Thursday 22nd, gorgeous"}
{"text":"Every time I'm on the west side of Phoenix before 11am I go out of my way to grab breakfast here.

The tacos are on point: quality tortilla, fresh cooked meats, perfect potatoes and eggs. If I don't grab extra for friends I'm in trouble."}
{"text":"Delicious 

Brushfire Tacos Y Tapas is a restaurant that has outside or drive thru dining only.  So you think to yourself, how good can this place be? Then you decide to give it try and realize, it is that good.

Brushfire offers a decent sized but not overpowering menu. You place your order at the window and then wait at one of the outside tables for your name to be called.

You can choose from single items, or combo menu that includes a taco and a tapas that will leave you wanting more.

You have to try the croquets, and empanadas, absolutely delicious. I originally went with the intention of getting a snack but ended up eating croquets, empanada, and a taco.

We will definitely visit again when in the area."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best Breakfast Burrito I got the egg and potatoe and really good.the best part of it it has that home made flavor and taste.
But that's not all the chicken empanada is to die for the best empanada I have ever tasted ever.
If your in the area I would definitely suggest you try."}
{"text":"Decent tacos but for what you get I thought overpriced. I guess to be expected but I wouldn't go rushing back anytime soon."}
{"text":"I had been meaning to try this place and I am so glad that I did!
I loved my grilled chicken taco with guac. The portion was generous and the seasoning was memorable. I eat a lot of chicken tacos so this is saying a lot.
I also had a grilled fish taco and I simply wasn't expecting to be wowed. It was just delicious and again, generous portion, instead of all tortilla and it was cooked perfectly tender, not dry at all. 
The price was reasonable especially for the quality. I think it was $7.xx for the two and I was quite satisfied.
But best of all, on the patio there was this delightful sign reminding us to invite someone to sit at our table. I know I used to be too uncomfortable to do as such, but I truly believe it's just the kind of thing we need more of. 
So I greatly look forward to returning, and sharing a seat!"}
{"text":"This place has it's good and bad days. I've been there several times and usually it is good, prices are a little high for what they give you. Unfortunately the last time I was there I bit into my shrimp taco to find a long thing piece of metal in my mouth, like a large piece of a staple. So glad I didn't swallow i notified the workers and they handled it very well, apologized profusely and gave me a refund and a free order..not sure if I'll be going back soon though. Their breakfast burritos are amazing if you can get there early enough."}
{"text":"If it wasn't for an email from Local Arizona, this taco shop would've slipped through my fingers. Tempted by promises of a free taco and/or churro with every meal on this particular day, a so-called \"grand opening\" special, I trekked out to this quaint little spot weary of what I might find. From previous reviews, which confused me since I pondered how there could be a month or so of reviews when the grand opening is actually today, \"gourmet tacos\" find their way at a drive through at a steep price, I had to find out for myself though and so off we went to put our taste buds to the test.

The menu is confusing because you can get a single taco or a \"flight.\" On the upper right corner of the menu, a small red box says, \"Get a flight, and you get a tapa, chips and salsa, and a small drink!\" That sounds excellent, but how many tacos come in a flight? One! One single taco comes in a flight. Spoiled by Taco Bell, you get 2 chalupas AND a beef taco with a meal. I was slightly disappointed by a single taco in the flight. You also have the choice of making that rolled taco into a burrito with the same ingredients, but hey, we didn't want to get too crazy with our order, so we just stuck with taco style.

Although the girl who took our order recommended chicken tacos, we ordered a flight of the steak tacos and a flight of the pork al pastor with pineapple tacos. Our hungry little appetites are seldom satiated by a single taco so we ordered 2 extra shrimp tacos and 1 extra steak taco. Since they were flights, we were able to order 1 tapa each, so we both got the flaky chicken empanadas. The empanadas had the correct flakiness and texture but were on the thinner side and came with spicy mayo. 

We really enjoyed our steak and pork tacos. From the reviews, I thought these would be street taco size, but I say they are slightly bigger. All tacos were overfilled with meat, the way I like my tacos to be! They are soft flour rolled tacos. Corn tortillas are by request. The taste of the tacos were really good. I expected less because of the drive through experience, but I was pleasantly surprised.  Today only, due to the grand opening special, they also offered a free churro with each meal and handed out free taco cards. 

When ordering here, I would get a steak or pork taco flight, choose the empanada as your tapa side, AND order an extra taco - preferably a shrimp one (to get the surf and turf effect)! Then, you would leave here satisfied and not hungry afterwards. If you have an extra hearty appetite then order 2 extra tacos, then you should be good. And extra FYI, the papas (fried seasoned potatoes) served with spicy mayo and the cilantro rice make good sides too if you wanted a little extra fillers. 

It's a fun little find. With free taco cards at hand, heck yeah, we will be back. I love tacos like crazy! Especially gourmet ones that are attainable by drive through! I mean, hey... there's just some days I'm too lazy to drive downtown, or the east side, to get my taco fix. Brushfire has lit my fire, but it's a small kindling flame at that. I want to know if it's the 'A' game today because it's their grand opening or if they're really that good usually because previous reviews say otherwise."}
{"text":"My son and I were making a u-turn and discovered this place. What a delight. My son got the make it a burrito with chicken and I got a bowl with chicken. I could not eat everything in my bowl and my son, who is a 20 year old decathlete and eats for 6, had to pace his eating to finish it. I have no complaints about the service either. I pulled up, ordered my food and left. The young lady at the window was polite and smiled....don't know what else she needed to do ? So, I don't get the people complaining about not getting Ruth's Chris service at a drive through window. Will definitely be eating here again."}
{"text":"It was yummy! No indoor seating only drive thru and patio. I had the chicken taco add beans and no tomato! I got the meal and had tapas  too. As long as they dont go cheap on the meat they will do well! Lots of dutch brother traffic is the only down fall. But love them too. The prices are budget friendly!

Keep up the yumminess"}
{"text":"Horrible. Food was incredibly overpriced. The meat was dry. Everything was cold... Total waste of money."}
{"text":"It's OK.  I have been there a few times, but I do not like eating outside on a patio when its hot and I hate eating in my car.  It makes it difficult to eat there in June, July and August or any day the weather is less than ideal.  I wish they had a salsa bar outside so I could get more salsa or try the other ones.  I also wish they had an outside drink station to get more water or tea.  I do not enjoy standing in line a second time because I am thirsty.  Over all if you are hungry this place is OK if the weather is OK too."}
{"text":"This place is dope. You can get tacos and taco related things. Shrimp tacos are bomb. Couldn't understand a word the lady was saying through the drive thru mostly cause I'm super white and can't roll my \"R\"s. I ended up just agreeing with everything she said. Food was still good tho."}
{"text":"First time here, waited 20 mins at the drive up, spent 22 bucks on 4 small tacos and 1 drink with chips nope sorry!!"}
{"text":"Soooo yummy!!!! Very filling tacos! Must try the potato and egg breakfast ones, they're wonderful. The empanadas are our #1 favorites so far!"}
{"text":"Very good food and service.  Steak tacos are great!  The reason it's 4 stars and not 5 is the location.  You have to fight to get in and out of there because of all the kids at the coffee shop."}
{"text":"They always have delicious and fresh food! You walk up to a window and order whatever you want (tacos,burritos, chips&salsa, empanadas, etc) and then you sit down outside under a canopy and wait for your order to be called. It comes out so fast! The steak burrito Is massive and the steak is always tender. Their brushfire and verde salsa is to die for! I always get some to take home for later. Upgrade to the flight it's a better deal and you get yummy tapas. We always take any out of towners here for lunch and they love it! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"First time here. Placed our order for 3 people. Picked up order at window by patio & they forgot  my meal. Went up to window to let them know & said they would have to ring up my $2.89 empanada because we were never charged for it. And we went over our order w girl at window before we paid. To make things worse the couple sitting next to us got a $20 gift card! A guy came out to tell them it was a thing they were doing for 5 De Mayo. Goid Job Brushfire for messing up an order & making customers happy for it! Never again in this place!"}
{"text":"Went here today and got the pork burrito. The burrito was mostly beans and rice and hardly any pork. My burrito was really bland and had no flavor except for a little sweet bite of pineapple every once in awhile. If I am going to spend 7 dollars on a burrito I will go up the street to Chipotle, at least that has flavor. I got their Brushfire salsa which has a flavor I don't care for (kind of plastic flavor). The girl taking the order was really nice and the fact they just opened I gave them 2 stars. I know sometimes it takes a little while to find your footing. Hopefully they will invest in some seasoning or at best some salt."}
{"text":"Amazing!! Wow! The flavor in their tacos is just wow! :D these are some of the best tacos ive tasted in a long time. Im so glad i tried this place out. The salsas wasnt bad either. Im the type who likes to venture out to taco stands and diners due to my taco cravings lol. And im sooo happy to find some amazing tacos here :D i cant wait to go back and try more items on their menu :D"}
{"text":"Happened upon this incredibly cute taco stand last night after taking the wrong exit.  At the urging of my adventurous son, we pulled up to the drive through with no idea what to order.  The great service began there! We entrusted the \"voice\" at the menu to provide his input as we were first time customers. He did not steer us wrong.  We had the chicken taco meal. Best tacos ever! Fresh ingredients, made to order! The best part of this whole unexpected experience was the friendly service at the window! Can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"Great burritos and tacos. Quick and friendly service at a great price. A must try for fast food."}
{"text":"I enjoy this place so much more than the corporate taco places out there. Support local!"}
{"text":"I really like the concept of a quick drive through place like the Dutch Bros next door. 

I wasn't sure what to try when I pulled up to the window so this isn't going to be a full review on the whole menu. Only on what I had and my girlfriend had. 

I ordered a chicken taco, pork taco, 2 shrimp tacos, and the croquetas. 

The chicken taco was so-so... They forgot my salsa which would've helped but the taco itself didn't have much flavor and the chicken was slightly on the dry side. I was glad I ordered a pork taco because that one was more tasty. Im not a huge fan of pineapple but it definitely made the pork taco unique and pretty tasty. Didn't even need salsa. The croquetas were the best part!! they were nice and warm, very cheesy with a good tangy chipotle type sauce on top. 

My girlfriend's two shrimp tacos were pretty tasty and had a yummy sauce on it. She ordered it without the slaw which I think would've made it better. 

Portions were small but I wasn't too hungry so it wasn't going to kill me. I'll go again to try more things because I find myself at Dutch Bros a lot. I'll post an update on more menu items as i try them."}
{"text":"I love this place! I have been a bunch of times in the last few weeks and haven't had a bad experience. I wouldn't sit outside because it's Phoenix! I go through the drive thru and either have it in the car or bring it home.

I don't like breakfast burritos but I love them here. I usually go for the Pork burrito with the fuego wings. Love the addition of pineapple in the burrito, it goes so well. The sauce on the bacon breakfast burrito and the steak breakfast bowl are amazing. One of the best Mexican restaurants I have been to in my 6 years in the valley!"}
{"text":"Just tried them for the first time and I have been waiting for them to open. Terrible terrible terrible. I asked a veggie burrito with no gauc and it was covered in it and I dont like mushrooms and she said that there weren't many in the veggies and that was a fabrication. I tossed it in the trash without eating it And the tacos that we ordered tasted like they had been sitting there for awhile and they were soggy. I'm glad we tried it cause now I'm not wondering and I won't be going back"}
{"text":"The food here is amazing. You can either walk up and dine on their patio or drive through. They have great service with friendly staff!! Try the croquetas served  with spicy mayo you won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"Keith H needs to get his panties out of a twist. Do not let his one star rating fool you, this place is a gem."}
{"text":"I had never even heard of Bushfire Tacos until I saw them on Groupon. After my first visit, I can say I'll be back. The gal at the window was pretty friendly for an early Saturday morning. Especially given my orders are never straight forward/easy given I eat a mostly plant based diet. I ordered one veggie taco (no cheese) with a side of bushfire salsa and some chips and guacamole. Loved the variety of vegetables on the taco and the salsa was fantastic! The chips were deliciously light and crispy. The guacamole was good, but nothing special.

My friends tried a couple of other items too:
- papas bravas: smelled delish and received 2 thumbs up
- breakfast burrito with chorizo: received an \"it was ok\" response

Of the 5 of us dining, everyone enjoyed their meals and said they'd be back. Give it a try!"}
{"text":"The BEST! I wish there were more of these around,  but I drive 17 miles one way to get my fix of Brushfire! They are really generous with wonderful, tasty meats.  I never get a piece of questionable chicken here! The flavors are amazing,  spicy mayo is excellent on everything. Come support this little local gem! Fun to eat at Brushfire and get a Dutch Bros drink right next door!"}
{"text":"It's like a permanent food truck anchored in a parking lot. I find it strange, but nonetheless I pass it twice a day to and from work; so curiosity got the best of me and I stopped here. 

I tried the croquetas--I found them gross. The outsides were crunchy, but the insides were like a soggy cream of ham soup; that is the best way I can describe them. The empanada was so-so; it's overpriced for what you get. I threw both of them out.

The burrito was pretty good; I got a shrimp burrito even though I thought I was taking a huge risk on either too little or crappy shrimp. Luckily neither was an issue. 

I'm willing to try the tacos or another burrito next time, but I would advise to skip the tapas."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a bite while visiting family. The tacos are a good size and the meats are well seasoned and tasty. The star of the show though was the empenada tapas and spicy mayo! They were bursting with flavor and generously stuffed! Service is great and food came out quick too!"}
{"text":"Awesome venue! Pick up you Tapas and Tacos and sit outside( shaded with misters)
All the food is fresh. Que no pare la Fiesta!"}
{"text":"I love their food right now I'm getting hungry just writing this review. Their menu has a lot of options the employees are super nice. They prices are great! The patio is nice to hangout under the mists. I used to come here like everyday until I moved further away. And I see they only have one in Arizona it's worth the half hour drive!"}
{"text":"Decided to give brushfire a couple more tries. They've definitely earned 4-stars compared to my first review of 2-stars. Their food is great but not $10 a burrito great and you don't have to put aioli in everything. Seriously, I know it's \"trendy\" but mayo doesn't belong in 90% of your menu. I do hope you pay your employees well or else it's just hard to justify paying $12 for a burrito and drink."}
{"text":"Meh. Had a pork burrito and just like the previous visit, very bland. I even added their habenero sauce I hopes it would help, not much flavor there either."}
{"text":"Went there around closing time and you could tell the workers were not happy that we were there. Then it took 20 minutes to get 2 STEAK tacos, so I was already annoyed about that but then when I got home and I opened up the boxes with two chicken tacos. Needless to say next time, if I ever go back I will be making it very clear what I want and not going near closing time."}
{"text":"AMAZING!!! I ordered the Carne Asada, Chicken, & Shrimp tacos since it was my first time eating from there just to see what would be my item of choice if I were to return again. I have no clue because everything was great. Very flavorful & fresh!!! A tad bit pricey but worth it. Not sure if the cashier was flirting with me or they just have great customer service. I'll take it either way. A MUST TRY!!!"}
{"text":"I have been here several times and the food is ok. I haven't found anything to bring me back regularly. The cost is also another factor too high for what you get. I do like the tacos,chips,and salsa."}
{"text":"This was my first time here. Tacos were good but the empanada was amazing! FYI there's only outdoor sitting. Overall it was a good experience!"}
{"text":"This drive thru has good food at good prices.it was so quick to get quality food. The folks inside were very friendly . I will defiantly be back. I epanada and ship en efuego. I would expect to pay more for such good food."}
{"text":"This place has a very cute outdoor space and covered patio. We ordered 2 meals (one pork taco and one with the fish taco). We got croquetas, empanada, and brush fire salsa. 

The tapas were the best thing we ordered by a long shot. Salsa was tasty.

But, the fish was so over cooked it was dry. The pork was good."}
{"text":"One of my guilty pleasures!! About once a month (sometimes twice :O) i frequent for tacos and i love to see all the improvements and menu changes!! When my out of town friends visit i bring them here! The food is delicious and the staff is fantastically friendly (especially for being in such close quarters!! ) I can't write enough about the flavor of the chicken tacos and the guacamole!!!"}
{"text":"First of all- tacos are really good, a little pricy compared to other places. Customer service is awful . I don't think they have experienced staff at the drive through. Probably a bad decision on the managers part. Girl informed us that they had dropped one of our tacos and had to remake it. She was not very friendly and never said thank you when I tipped her 20% on a drive through order."}
{"text":"Very good food!  This place was our go-to place for quick food when we lived in the West Valley.  I recommend the shrimp bowl- very fresh ingredients and very tasty!  Also, big portions for the price!"}
{"text":"Update: It was once again my turn for Taco Friday today and as before I called them ahead of time and was out of there with (only 52 tacos this time) and headed to work by 6:30 am. As expected the tacos were great and everyone enjoyed them again!

Thanks again Brushfire!
Looking forward to other locations, maybe closer to work in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Brushfire is great! The people are friendly, their food is fresh and everything is delicious!"}
{"text":"First time I have eaten here and I will be back. Staff very friendly and helpful. Has the steak taco flight and it was much better than I had hoped for! Definitely a must eat at place"}
{"text":"Okay so nice had their dinner tacos before but today is the first time I have had their breakfast. And oh my gosh the chorizo taco is so good you just have to try it. The papas bravas are always my favorite to get. Other than that the other lunch and dinner tacos are pretty good but breakfast I think takes the trophy. This place is definitely worth a try everything is really good here. :)"}
{"text":"Went here again today and I enjoyed it a lot more. I mixed it up and had the shrimp tacos with corn tortillas. They were really good. I would order them again. The corn tortilla was a little chewy, I wish they had better tortillas. The shrimp and fillings were great though. My mom enjoyed her taco as well. 
I got it in a flight and it came with chips. I got the croquettes again and they were a little mushy. 
The service was friendly and good. 
Hopefully they continue this upswing as they get more experienced! I will be back. 

Oh I had the brushfire salsa and it was good!"}
{"text":"Got the wrong item, plus the meat cold. The papas were way too over seasoned. As much as I wanted to try it out, I don't think I'll be going back."}
{"text":"Tried to get me to sign up for the spam card.  When I asked if they'd send texts etc initially I was lead to believe I could opt out of that.  She explained it as an \"electronic lunch card\" then I asked why they needed my number.  The food isn't bad but for the trouble I much prefer Chipotle.  I was told they wouldn't honor my accumulated punches;  Which would have been the next visit.  #lasttimeieatthere"}
{"text":"Meh.....  always a anted to try it out since I pass it so often going to Dutch Bros. Today I realized that I'm not missing out on much."}
{"text":"Love this place!  I go there at least once a week for their fabulous tacos and empanadas.  The best fast food joint around."}
{"text":"Lunch and dinner is pretty good here, but breakfast is where their food shines. That chorizo breakfast burrito is one of the best I've ever had!"}
{"text":"I love their vegetarian options(burrito or taco). I love coming here for lunch or dinner but there has been quite a few time where they've forgetten my Chips and salsa, or my chocolate dip for my churros."}
{"text":"Similar to a chipotle and rio cafe. The meat is not as flavorful as it should be. But the customer service is very great, we had a awesome cashier, Pearl. Decent servings for the price range."}
{"text":"Somewhere between 3 and 4 stars. This taco stand had been on my list for quite awhile but I am rarely in the area. They are literally 1 minute off the 101. I was in the area and wanting drive thru. Fun, interesting menu. I ordered the steak taco meal. The meal includes the taco, chips, drink and your choice of 1 tapas item. The chips are good but I dont care that much about chips. The steak taco was good but the tiny diced steak was disappointing and the sizing is odd. Bigger than a street taco but not huge. 1 taco will not fill me for long but they aren't priced to be buying multiples. The Chicken empanada was spicy and interesting. Also ordered churros. They were greasy and light on the sugar and cinnamon. Clearly a step above your usual Mexican drive thru. Maybe I need to try one of their bowls next time."}
{"text":"This place has an amazing mayo sauce and I love ordering all of the side dishes as snacks. Absolutely delicious!"}
{"text":"It was okay. The burrito I got was HUGE and reasonably priced too. The outdoor area was pleasant and made it a generally positive experience. I wasn't sure about the content of the burrito - the cilantro-lime dressing was non-existent, so it turned out to be quite a bland affair; hence the 3 stars - sorry!"}
{"text":"Lunch here was just right, not too much and not too little. I was able to try two of the salsas and they were right on. I really want to go back and try something else!"}
{"text":"We ride our bikes to get breakfast here often. We've never had a bad experience. The bacon breakfast tacos/burritos and a horchata are always our choice and delicious."}
{"text":"Love this place! Amazing tacos and out of this world customer service. I am always blown away by the people here- they truly care about their customers."}
{"text":"I love this place! I usually get the veggie burrito. It's amazing! It's a little pricey if you ask me, but the burritos are big enough to split out save for later. I like the \"flight\" option. You get a drink, chips and salsa and a tapa. It's a small drive thru place, so it's great for grabbing something quick. They use very fresh ingredients."}
{"text":"Love all of their food, especially their breakfast burritos!!!
Hate that it is in the same complex of dutch brothers since they always have bad traffic,
I would give five star if they had bigger cup sizes. Sounds stupid but my family likes a lot of liquid with their meal.
I recommend the bacon breakfast burrito and their empanadas."}
{"text":"Pork tacos are GREAT! The pineapple in the tacos wirh the feta cheese is excellent! Papas bravas weren't really good. Chicken burrito is tasty as well. Verde salsa was pretty quick,  to much lime flavor though.  Fast and friendly service. Will visit again!"}
{"text":"Oh this little place is so yummy.  Funny thing, the best menu items are the tapas!  I am serious, the empanada is to die for.  LOVE it.  The croquettes are good too, both served up with their tasty aioli.  We have tried all the tacos and they're all good.  I have yet to really enjoy their salsas.  They're all just ok.  Love that it's a drive through but it's so yummy!"}
{"text":"You had me at taco . This was was packed in their outside seating area (which is all there is) I went through the drive thru and was greater right away by a happy voice. After explaining I'd never been here before she gave me some great options. I decided on the steak taco meal which to my pleasant surprise came with a side, chips and salsa plus a drink. How cool is that?! This may sound funny, but it came out as the prettiest taco I'd ever seen lol. Very fast service, very friendly, and most important very, very tasty! I may be here frequently lol"}
{"text":"Wonderful burritos and tapas. Try the croquetas; they are cooked to perfection. Everything tastes fresh and not greasy. We tried all of the tacos; we were not disappointed!  The staff is friendly and patient and love dogs!"}
{"text":"Great food! I got the chicken taco with the salsa verde and it was amazing, very flavorful and fresh. I also had the shrimp en fuego and you must eat it with the sauce -- it's sweet and spicy and so very delicious! And top off your meal with a churro dipped in their chocolate sauce! The only drawback is that there is no indoor dining space - there is a drive-thru or a walk-up window with an outdoor patio."}
{"text":"They have really bomb breakfast burritos and also their tacos are wonderfully delicious pricey but really really good. The chips and green salsa are also a must have."}
{"text":"My girl and I had a steak taco, chicken taco, croquetas, and an empanada. All had a great flavor. I would suggest trying this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Really great non fast-food drive thru food!  we really wanted some Mexican food wo the time to sit down and it met all out needs!   Well recommend it to others.y"}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place. Gourmet tacos are a great idea. Now the but, first off having cleaning products splashed on you and your food while they chose to clean at dinner rush is a bad idea! Then a hair in your taco and spoiled lettuce makes you lose your appetite. Slimy chicken and a leaky container that spilled everywhere sealed it. 
On the plus side the salsa was good. But the rest left us feeling nauseous. After spending about $40 bucks, my kids hated it and I now have to get them another dinner!
Stay away!"}
{"text":"Brushfire will always be my option compare to chipotle or other mexican restaurants. The customer service there is amazing and people are really friendly going out of their way to make everything nice. The food it is always amazing and you can never go wrong with their shrimp and fuego with their burritos, it is like fries for a burger, the best combo ever! I would recommend to anyone this place and their food!"}
{"text":"2 tacos, seasoned potatoes, dipping sauce, chips, salsa and a drink for $8?  I'll eat it any day.  I had the shrimp taco with verde salsa, and the veggie taco with the wildflire salsa.  I enjoyed the shrimp taco more, but the veggie taco was delicious as well.  A good option for vegetarians without feeling like your missing out.  Yes, the tacos are small, but I think the portions are just right.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"Tasty place.  The food is a bit much for what you get but it taste great.

This a DRIVE thur place, they do have a little window you can get food from on foot , but its best to go through the window.  

oddly the sides cost more than the entrees? I'm not sure if thats good or bad.

Anyway its a good taco place and that uses quality ingredients. 

Wonderful to-go option."}
{"text":"Ridiculous how unorganized and slow for being an established business. 24 min in line behind 3 cars... for 1 combo.. as the cashier/window girl laughs and flirts with some customer out the take out window, being reminding consistently that there are customers lining up and to basically, do her job. It's a poor location, very crammed for just an oversized, nonmobile food truck. Start with correcting service, the easy errors - not just making combo meals and getting rid of taco flights. This review is after the 3rd time visiting, 3rd time dissatisfied - but I can at least say I gave it more than a chance..."}
{"text":"So. Couple things. I do want to like this place . I been wanting to try it for a while now and I did today their food is good it has flavor although that spicy mayo they put on everything and it over whelms their dish. Don't get me wrong it's good it's not bad but I had way to much of it on the steak breakfast taco which made me not taste so much of the rest and also my steak on the taco was good however it was over cooked. . Croquetas are not bad but they're super small. Size of a quarter . Staff IS super friendly so that helps them a lot. I think maybe if they came up with another sauce for their dishes they'll have a better outcome . I also tried their empanada. Not bad but then again they serve it with that spicy mayo dip which quite frankly I don't think it goes with the empanada. Now, I will come back and give them a second chance and try another item on their menu. Their food has flavor ."}
{"text":"I just don't get it.  Every time I'm at Dutch Bros this place looks busy. I finally tried it for lunch. Well 20 minutes later just getting through the drive through to pay. (3 total cars in line including me) Maybe this is why they look busy. Everyone is waiting.

I get the pork taco meal. What a waste of time and money.  One small taco, good garnish but the meat was over cooked and pithy. The rice is so-so. The drink is tiny. The only saving grace and why I give two stars was the salsa and chips. Good salsa.  

Maybe got there on a 'slow' day but for what you get not worth the money.  Unless you have 15 extra minutes to just pick up chips and salsa."}
{"text":"Order the steak tacos,you will not be disappointed,unless you do not order a shrimp taco also,they also have pork tacos and veggie tacos just order them all that way no one will be disappointedYum Yum see you want to yelp later"}
{"text":"If there's one thing I've learned by living in Arizona all these years, it's that no two Mexican restaurants are exactly alike. That's a good thing if you love adventure, especially when you run across a gem like Brushfire Tacos Y Tapas because there is literally no place like it. 

Before I get into the review, I should tell you what I think makes good Mexican food. I love fresh ingredients, unique combinations and interesting flavors. I have friends who judge Mexican food strictly by heat - but I'd rather taste everything I'm eating. I'm not trying to prove my tongue is made of cast iron, I want to take my time and taste every ingredient in every bite. And of course, great customer service is a must because it can make a good meal a really great experience. 

That's what I like about Brushfire. It's a tiny little drive thru restaurant that's really unique. I think it's actually designed out of old shipping containers and I thought that was pretty cool. It's small with a walk up window and a couple of stone picnic tables in the back for seating. It's not the typical \"taco stand\" that we see on every street corner in the Valley. It's a little more upscale and you'll see that in the menu offerings, the fresh ingredients and on the times I've visited - in the friendly customer service. 

With a menu that features tacos and tapas, you'd probably expect it to be in a nicely decorated, traditional, sit down restaurant. But this is more sidewalk fare, sold mostly a la carte and served in styro containers and cups. Like I said, it's a little different. 

So, in reading some of the earlier reviews, I can see how some people are thrown by this place. If you're expecting a typical \"taco stand\" the prices will be a little higher and if you're expecting a traditional dining experience, you might be put off by sitting outside or eating out of a takeout bag. I have to admit, I wasn't sure what to expect on my first visit but to me, Brushfire is really the best of both worlds.

Tacos run about $3.50 each but even in a styrofoam package, this food looks and tastes amazing! (How they make a taco look appetizing in a styro container is an art in itself!) Lots of fresh ingredients and subtle flavors make each bite one to savor. If you're a first timer - start with a flight and try the empanadas - a light flaky deep friend pocket of chicken and veggies, served over a bed of lettuce and sour cream with spicy mayo on the side. You may be tempted to customize your order but on your first visit, try going with everything as described because these are subtle flavor combinations that really go together. A flight includes a drink and chips and your choice of salsa (try the Verde a medium salsa with an avocado base or the Brushfire medium salsa for a little more kick) for about $7.50 - $8.00.

Most adults will want a couple of tacos, especially if you want to explore the menu. I've tried the pork served \"el pastor\" bbq style with pineapple, pico and cheese. Add a little of their Wildfire or Inferno salsa if you want to bring the heat but try one bite without first to see what's going on inside the flour tortilla. Same goes for the chicken taco, marinated in cilantro-lime, grilled, served with pico, cheese and some really great guacamole. Each came with a slice of lime on the side. Perfecto! Other taco options include shrimp, veggie and steak but I love the pork and chicken so much, I'm having a hard time getting to those - maybe on my next visit? 

If you're a light eater, you can get by on a flight, chips and a drink but if you're like me and get caught up in sampling all the options, you can expect to spend over $10 for two tacos, a little tapas, chips/salsa and a drink. I'm hoping in the future they come up with options for two taco or even a three taco flight - to help customers really have fun with the menu.

If you have the kids in tow, there are menu options for them ranging from some of the tapas offerings from the croquettas (ham and cheese croquettes) the kids burrito or quesidilla. Don't forget to save room for the churros with choco dipping sauce on the side. 

That being said, this place won't be for everyone but seriously, you can say that about every Mexican place in Arizona. Ask any three people what their favorite Mexican restaurant is and you'll get three different answers. That's one of the perks of living here so get out there and start trying new places!

Traditional taco stands will still have their legions of fans who carry hot sauce in their glove box. Those nice traditional Mexican places will still enjoy their customers that want to make a night of it. But for me, this place does the trick. And judging by the continuous line in the drive thru on our visits, the word seems to be getting around. Glad to see people coming out to support local restaurants!"}
{"text":"Muy delicioso! I've driven thru several times and each visit has left me happier than the last. 

Brushfire offers a wide selection of tacos, each with specialized toppings. I swoon for the adobado pork, which includes juicy bits of pineapple, spicy peppers, and cotija cheese in a flour tortilla. If you want corn tortillas instead, ask. 

Other tacos include chicken, carne asada, shrimp, and veggie, which has roasted peppers, red potatoes, mushrooms, and other bits. Tacos can also be upgraded to burritos, bowls, or added to a flight. 

Flights include your entree, fresh chips and your choice of five fresh salsas, a tapas and drink...and they not only have coke zero, they also have decent unsweetened iced tea. 

Tapas options seem smaller recently, but are still crunchy bliss. I love the shrimp, like the croquetas and empanadas, and haven't tried the roasted potatoes. 

Service is speedy and super friendly. This is a eat in the car sort of place, so ask for extra napkins and just relax. You may just want to drive thru again for churros or flan."}
{"text":"Love this place!!
Food is always delicious and staff is always super friendly. They pay special attention to my food allergies which is appreciated. 

** BONUS POINTS ** I typically have my 3 dogs with me when going through the drive thru, the staff always treats them well and makes a big deal about them. Dog friendly...HUGE bonus points!"}
{"text":"Amazing... Amazing! Try the veggie taco! The shrimp taco was also great! The gal at the drive their window is very friendly... Overall great experience!"}
{"text":"Had a bean and cheese burrito and some tapas. Burrito hit the spot. I would recommend asking for multiple salsas they really add to the flavor. Our side was croquetas, smaller than what you would have in Spain but good taste."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a place that serves food like Taco Bell or Del Taco do not read any further!  Brushfire offers fresh quality food that is priced higher than fast food establishments, but cheaper than the sit down restaurants.  Do yourself a favor and check this place out if in the area or looking for some flavorful tacos and tapas.

Whether you walk up or go thru the drive thru, be prepared to enjoy some great Mexican/Spanish tapas. This place could be on anyone's weekly go to list without hesitation."}
{"text":"I have eaten here 100 times over the last two years, not kidding. The food is great! There are a few reasons I stopped going: 1, it is VERY overpriced. As in, you will pay 8 bucks for a burrito half the size of a chipotle burrito and 5 bucks for a street taco that you would have to eat 4 of to be satisfied. Don't get me wrong the food is good, but if I take my girl here we end up spending 30 bucks to go through a drive through for 2 people. Way too much money for fast food. 

The second reason I stopped going was this: I also don't like the idea of being peer pressured to tip someone for handing me my food through a drive through window. It teaches unwarranted entitlement to a young person that they are deserving of tips for doing nothing tip worthy. It has happened to me several times here, and since I work hard for my money I don't like the idea of giving it to someone else for no reason just because they have their hand out and think they deserve it.

Now trust me when I tell you that I am not a cheapskate and I am a very good tipper. I enjoy tipping people who rate a tip and don't mind paying more for better products. However, this place is using a product pricing system and tipping system that is WAY above their caliber and status of restaurant."}
{"text":"AWESOME food! Great fresh ingredients, tasted amazing. Can't wait until Taco Tuesday!! Friendly helpful staff too, couldn't have asked for a better experience."}
{"text":"No flavor! Even filibertos tastes better than this place and this place is more expensive. Everything tasted like it was from a jar or a can. I got the vegetarian burrito and tried all the salsas. The verde was like watered down guacamole and pineapple. I kinda lost my appetite after trying that one. I think fast food can still have some flavor and even i can make a better homemade salsa than what i paid for. I dont know why everyone gave this place great reviews but you need to get out more and try some real food."}
{"text":"I have driven past this place many times only today making it for a quick dinner. Service was pleasant and served very quick, I ordered the steak taco with wildfire sauce on the side along with an order of the Papas Bravas with spicy mayo. The size of the taco was larger than expected and the taste was good but most of the Beef Steak was grissle and could not be broke down with chewing. This was a shame as the flavor was good. The potatoes were spiced nicely and fried for a crisp exterior and creamy center. With the spicy mayo these were the bomb and will having me come back for. I hope it was a bad day for the beef but when I try again I will be ordering the chicken and pork, not the steak imposter."}
{"text":"Great food! Had the chicken taco with beans and rice. Yummy! Superior customer service- we will be back!"}
{"text":"BACON...BREAKFAST...BURRITO

The best I've ever had and nothing else can come close. It's a little pricey compared to similar style establishments but I'd rather pay a few extra bucks and have quality food. An easy favorite."}
{"text":"It's a good drive through Mexican place that's shaking things up. 

Like it may not be my favorite, but I appreciate the variety they bring to all the basic Chipotle stans of Peoria. 

You've got two options--the walk-up window outside and the drive through. For your meals, it's essentially a choice of a large tacos or burritos that are T H I C C. They come with chips, salsa, and a drank. 

Things I like--I like the idea of their steak burritos. The ingredients and the portions of them are done correctly. You don't feel like they're skimping on the protein. You feel full when you're done, but not the same kind of full that leads you to taking a nap for the next two hours. 

Things I don't like--I think they could improve how they season their meat and rice (i.e. seasoning their steak at all). I think the salsa isn't offensive but is watery and playing it too safe. Something that's got a 4 out of 5 on your heat scale shouldn't taste like tomato juice that came into brief contact with a lone pepper. 

Things that absolutely make me LOL--They actually marketed tacos are \"tapas\". It's dumb, but I am kinda happy such a modest place like this did that before some $40-a-plate mediocre tex mex place in Old Town or Downtown beat them to it. If Brushfire did this ironically, I would have given them five stars and just doted on that while barely even touching my food opinions. 

In the end, I'm still happy to see new independent Mexican spots open up. I just don't want them to be afraid of flavor and spice. I hope they continue to thrive and improve."}
{"text":"Drove by today and thought what a great idea tacos for lunch!!  I'm severely disappointed (not about price I'm ok with paying money for good food) for about $9 you get a taco aside I took the empanada some chips and some salsa. The taco had very little Cotija cheese... some will flavored chicken and less than a tablespoon of guacamole.
The line took about ten minutes..  not a big deal. But the food was cold, my taco literally looked like someone had eaten half the chicken out of it

I'm really disappointed for almost $10 for a lunch meal I really expected better."}
{"text":"Love this place for shrimp and veggie tacos. They are a great place to go for a quick bite at a quaint place. The tapas are delicious as well. Sign up via the reward program and you earn free food and get deals texted to you as well. They are frequently on groupon so that is another plus!  Always friendly staff."}
{"text":"Finally they have something going on for Taco Tuesday. Stop by on Tuesdays to pay $5 for a combination of a taco and tapa of your choice. The tacos that apply to the special are chicken, pork, and veggie. The tapas up for selection are empanada, croquetas, and papas bravas. Unfortunately, steak and shrimp tacos are not included in the $5 combo. I still like the steak tacos best. The chicken tacos are not too shabby though.  

I started joining the Brushfire Loyalty Club. Basically, I just enter my phone number to earn points for rewards every time I order. They often will text me about promotions going on, such as earning triple points on New Year or free chips & salsa. 

I took away one star because every time I order an empanada, they always forget to place it in the bag. The first incident I paid $2.49 for the empanada togo, and realized when I got home that they did not put my empanada in my bag. With the second incident, I ordered an empanada, checked the bag at the window, and once again they failed to remember the empanada that I paid for. I would highly suggest checking that all your orders are in the bag before driving off. They will forget!"}
{"text":"I had brushfire tacos tonight for dinner. As I was opening up my cup of ice tea mixed with lemonade, I seen those brown slimy substance which between pieces of ice. I grab a strainer poured the Arnold Palmer over the strainer and out came this nasty brown slimy goop. I will never eat there again!!!"}
{"text":"What a rip off! I ordered a steak bowl with no rice or bean, instead add extra veggies. I asked for 2 pico's, 2 of their other salsa's and a side of guacamole. It cost over $16!!! I figured at a Mexican Food place they would give you a couple free sides of salsa and expected to pay for the rest. Not here! I paid $4 for 4 sides of 2 oz salsas, .75 cents for some soggy mushrooms and pepper(wasn't expecting mushrooms) and $2.99 for a 2 oz side of guacamole.  Who charges extra for lettuce and peppers?  If a place is going to charge for some measly salsa and veggies they should at least let you know. Will never eat here again."}
{"text":"The first time I went to Brushfire was a couple of weeks ago. I was stoked because the food was great and the prices were cheap. Def 5 stars. However, I went back yesterday and while the food was still good, the exact same meal cost me $2.50 more than my first visit. Not a deal breaker, but def not cool Brushfire. While I like the new styrofoam containers that prevent my taco from leaking salsa all over the bag, I'd rather save my $2.50 and deal with a messy taco. Bring back the cheap-o wrappers and the cheap-o prices :D please?"}
{"text":"I had the Groupon which was a great deal. I ordered the shrimp taco and croquetas and both were awesome. They even have a points program for regulars. The one taco and tapas was just enough to fill me up!"}
{"text":"Good food, fast! Loved the patio misters and patient staff. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Three stars in my book is solid food, just nothing that special. The \"wildfire\" salsa was lame, hardly spicy at all. Had a steak taco and chicken taco and both were pretty good. Super friendly service at the drive through."}
{"text":"The service was good.. But the shrimp taco wasn't edible..had to toss it and the veggie taco wasn't much better. Waste of $10!!! Only reason I didn't give one star was bc the girl at the window was so nice. But come on they specialize in tacos and their tacos suck.. Really hope I don't get food poisoning or something...."}
{"text":"This place was a fun little find!  I was pleasantly surprised by how good the breakfast tacos were and the salsas were tasty!  They had a cute patio and it was just an overall good experience.  The churros with chocolate sauce really ended it on a high note!  Definitely recommend and will be back!"}
{"text":"For a fast food taco place it's good I thought the food was fresher tasting than others. Was it amazing, no. But I'd come back in a pinch"}
{"text":"Goodbye chipotle, hello Brushfire!  Went for the first time today.  Shrimp burrito with verde sauce.  AWESOME!  The burrito was huge and very fresh.  Used the drive thru that was a little tight in a crew cab truck but no worse than the In & Out burger 2 miles away.  

I will be going back frequently.  Enjoy it while it is still new and not all that busy.  I can see Brushfire taking off and opening franchises across the country.  Great concept!"}
{"text":"Sigh.  Two disappointing visits in a row.  Today the food was not prepared according to the order.

I might have to give up on this one altogether."}
{"text":"I was looking for a good drive thru places for tacos within a reasonable distance, and Brushfire didn't disappoint.  We ordered carne asada tacos and pork tacos as well as an order of croquetas. 

The tacos are served on flour tortillas, although you can request corn. They didn't skimp on the filling... My carne asada taco was overflowing with me that I scooped up with a fork. The pork taco was my favorite. The meat was flavorful and the pineapple added just the right amount of sweetness. 
The croquetas were tasty, although I would have liked a little more ham. 

Service was good even though we arrived 10 minutes before closing. My only complaints are that they were out of limes and one of the tacos that I had requested items left of off was made incorrectly.  But I will define be back."}
{"text":"Waited at least 25+ minutes in the drive thru line. Food is good but not that good for such a long wait. Don't have a drive thru line if you can't get people in and out in a timely manner. I would have left but by minute 5 I was trapped in. Feel bad because the window lady was so nice."}
{"text":"I ordered the fish tacos   Way overpriced  weren't even any good and small as hell lil bitty things  I left there and went to get food"}
{"text":"Inventive menu, and tasty food. The veggie taco is good but it comes in a single flour tortilla that doesn't hold together for even one bite."}
{"text":"Rather disappointed in this place actually. Food was good, not amazing , but good. But portion size , topped with poor service made it a place we'll skip when picking a quick dinner out. I don't get their menu. Food and sides don't go together really, and the whole thing just doesn't make sense to me. When we were ordering, it seemed as if we were bothering her, which was slightly awkward. Overall, not a good experience. Cool name, but not relative to the food at all. I'd say skip this place."}
{"text":"Who am I kidding the food is amazing and I can't stay away.   Brush fire  salsa  is nothing like I ever tasted, it's addicting."}
{"text":"The service I received today was great; I went through the drive through and the lady taking my order was beyond pleasant. I wish the quality of the food matched the level of service!

We ordered a burrito (flight style - which means you get the burrito, a drink, chips and \"tapa(s)\". For $10.50, I was expecting tapaS (plural). We only received one empanada which was sad, because it was a pretty good empanada. The steak burrito was just an average burrito.

We also tried the shrimp taco, pork taco and chicken taco. The pork taco was the best out of the three, but I felt like they were all pretty small. The flavors were interesting, but not astonishing. 

The hottest salsa was good (wildfire, I believe), but the others weren't that special. The chips were fine but saltier than I'd like.

The service may bring me back to try it again."}
{"text":"Brushfire is my \"go-to taco drive thru place\" i love their shrimp taco and their pork taco! Loaded with flavor and very fresh tasting. Doesnt taste like \"fast food\". I have always received my order in a timely manner and overall the customer service is great! I love their rewards system as well. I think they should open more locations!"}
{"text":"Breakfast burritos from here are my favorite! Although I haven't ever had anything from brushfire I didn't like!!! I wish they had nutrition information and also wish they served breakfast all day :-) we are regular customers!!!"}
{"text":"Omg this place is phenomenal! The service was impressive and the food was delicious. My sister raved about this place and my mom and I were running errands nearby so  we decided to try it out - I'm so happy we did! We both ordered a shrimp taco and then got some chips and guacamole as well. The tacos and guac were amazing! I was still hungry as I hadn't eaten much that day so I went back up to the window and ordered a bean & cheese burrito (tip: ask for queso fresco in your burrito!!!). It was so yummy! It is a drive thru but they also have patio seating and a restroom right on the side of the building. It's a cute little place and truly wonderful food. We will be back very soon!"}
{"text":"I used to live in the Arrowhead area and have since moved over 30 miles away. We still make the drive for the amazing breakfast burritos, steak tacos and steak fries. Amazing customer service and delicious food!"}
{"text":"Yummy street tacos! The Best empanadas! Always great service.  Easy drive through for something great!"}
{"text":"One of the best taco's I've had in a long time.  An addictive menu with delicious sides, I just ate here yesterday and I already want to eat here again.  I would definitely recommend to anyone to eat here. Sooooo good.  Great service."}
{"text":"Had a really nice lunch here, had the al pastor taco with pork and pineapple, the carne asada steak taco, and the grilled fish taco. Order at the window, they'll call your name when ready.  Simple and delicious,  eat outside under a tent with tables and chairs."}
{"text":"Stopped by this place for a late lunch and let yelp reviews decide what I ordered. Had shrimp, chicken, and pork tacos. I also tried the croquettes as well. Shrimp taco had the most flavor of anything I had. The salsas I tried lacked kick but hit the spot in the fresh department. I wan not impressed with the chicken or pork tacos, to me the meat was a bit dry and with the tortilla it just added to it. 

Shrimp taco yum
Spicy mayo bomb 
Pork and pineapple combo good
Pork and chicken was dry 

I'll give it another shot one day. The design of the place is pretty cool with the storage container look and feel."}
{"text":"Heard about this place from one of my friends and was excited to go try it. Reputation is gourmet high quality food, but casual patio dining and drive-thru service. Decided to just try a carne asada taco today. 
Actually pretty disappointed with it. Seemed overpriced at 4 bucks, but it could have been worth it if it had been done well. Really the whole taco was lukewarm, and tasted like it had been refrigerated previously and left out at room temperature maybe for a while. This was very confusing because I had to wait about 10 minutes to get it served through the drive-thru window when I was the only car in line. So I was expecting it to be fresh made, and for this price it should be. The meat seemed high quality, but again wasn't fresh and was somewhat congealed and semi tough and cold. If it had been served fresh off the grill, it probably would have been more tender and flavorful. Cold tacos? I think not."}
{"text":"I was really excited about this place opening so close to my house.  We went a few times before their grand opening.  The first time was really good where everything was fresh and tasty.  The shrimp tacos were really good.  But the two times after we went back they were inconsistant.  It just wasn't as good.  I tried the chile lime rice and it was mush.  I think we'll try it again but only after they've been open a while and hopefully get more consistant."}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time tonight. The cashier was very friendly. We ordered some veggie tacos and they were delicious! They were a little on the small side so next time we'll probably order three each. At only about $10 for two people (not including drinks), we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Food is decent here but it's not very customer friendly. We bought a Groupon that had three $8 vouchers for $15. Terms at bottom say \"1 voucher per person per visit\" and \"Fully transferable.\" 
I drive my family of five 22 miles out of our way and the guy wouldn't let my wife and son use the other two vouchers. No exceptions, didn't care that we lived so far away we would never use them. Tried to explain the the Terms were super misleading and wouldn't budge. No exceptions. That's BS. Clear up your Terms on the site!"}
{"text":"We went here instead of grabbing fast food and were pleasantly surprised.  We got the steak, shrimp and fish tacos.  I liked the shrimp the best and my husband's favorite was the fish.  We went with corn tortillas instead of the flour.  The spicy salsa we got on the side was good on all three tacos.  We also tried the chicken empanada with spicy mayo, which was pretty good but not sure it was worth the calories, as it was fried and served with spicy mayo.  We probably would just go with more tacos next time."}
{"text":"First time eating here, but hubby was in town and we're always looking for a good taco place to try. Funny thing is that we didn't order tacos! Immediately saw the empanadas on the menu and just HAD to order that. Husband ordered the chorizo burrito (cause it was only about 8:30 a.m.), and some quesadillas and churros for our 3 yr. old that was with us. I was very happy with my chicken empanadas! Its not the traditional corn flour empanadas like the ones I had in Cancun, but the filling was delicious. The outside was very flaky and yummy as well! They serve it with spicy mayo on the side. I ordered their salsa Verde (which is on the mediym scale if spiciness; so if you like a \"comfortable kick\", then get this one. It went well with the mayo and empanadas. My husband was impressed with the chorizo burrito. Some places cook the chorizo WITH the eggs, but Brushfire didn't, so it has more of a chorizo flavor. They also had potatoes, a melted cheese (that wasn't thick; more on the runny side, so went perfectly with the rest of the filling), and spicy mayo. It was good and a good size....not thin like those silly McDonalds breakfast burritos. Very pleasantly surprised by this small outdoor restaurant. Will definitely be back to try their tacos! Guy who took our order was also very friendly and welcoming! A must-try!"}
{"text":"Santa knows if you skip Taco Tuesday.

So don't skip it, bruh.

On Taco Tuesday, they have a BOGO half off special and you can make one of those tacos a meal if you want.  My friend and I each got a BOGO taco with one as a meal.  He got steak taco with guacamole, pico salsa with his chips, and an empanada. I got the pork taco with pineapple, verde salsa with my chips, and an emanada.  I also got us a side of croquetas to share.  Our meals also came with a soda.  

Since we each got the BOGO meal, we exchanged tacos so we got the chance to try more food.  I'm usually a sucker for al pastor tacos and while the pork taco had good flavor, it was sadly dry.  It looked insanely gorgeous in pictures and in person since it's so colorful but I enjoyed the juicy steak tacos more.  The verde salsa was the better of the two salsa as it had more flavor but it really didn't have any heat.  The empandas [pastry filled with chicken and veggies; spicy mayo, lettuce, sour cream] were good although a bit too salty and greasy for my taste.  My friend really liked them though.  As for the croquetas [potato balls with ham, cheese, and spicy mayo], which come six per order, these were tiny gumball sized potato balls which were great with the spicy mayo provided but easily nothing too memorable.

As I type this, I'm about to fall into a food coma.  It was a decent meal and I want to come back to try their breakfast.  The prices are on the higher side for a place with no indoor dining but the quality is there.  Decent eats for a decent price.  I wouldn't go out of my way to come here but I wouldn't say no to an invite for some Brushfire!"}
{"text":"I've tried coming here multiple times because I always hear such great things about it. It's usually so busy and right next to Dutch brothers so when I saw it was slow today I jumped on my chance. I have never been there before so ordering for the first time was slightly confusing but I ordered the steak taco meal. I assumed it would come with more than one but surprisingly with the side of rice and chips and salsa I was actually full after eating it. I wish the cups were slightly bigger however I got tea and it was really good. 
      The guy at the window was very friendly and nice and I really enjoyed that he took the time to talk to us while our food was being bagged. I was excited to try this place after talking with him because he really seemed like he likes his job. I got home and the food really was very delicious. I will definitely be back if I can catch it on a slow day again."}
{"text":"Breakfast burritos are great.  Other things not so great for us.  We ordered chicken and beef burritos.  We actually ended up throwing them away.  Bland and just not good.  Which is to bad, because the breakfast burritos are soooo good.

We've been there four or five times now.  Customer service has been pretty good, with only one exception.  The girl seemed irritated by our Groupon."}
{"text":"I've never felt so robbed , the many wonderful Mexican restaurants out here. I encourage exploring elsewhere."}
{"text":"I have only had their breakfast burritos, which they only have two options bacon and chorizo.  The chorizo is good but the bacon is better and the bacon is crispy which I love!  And the spicy mayo is good but I could do without it.  The verde salsa is yummy."}
{"text":"Food was fantastic. Really fresh and very good. The chicken on my taco was a bit dry and the portions weren't very big..... I'm a BIG \"value\" guy though and I'm not sure it's that good of a value. My lunch was a chicken taco \"flight\" (their term for a combo meal) to include chips and salsa, a drink and a side. I paid another $1 for the shrimp side. Al in it was over $9 to sit on a concrete bench outside and eat out of styrofoam. I think that if chipotle can be a brick and mortar with a dining room and serve fresh Mexican food with their overhead.... And make HUGE MONEY....This joint made from shipping containers and no dining room should be a slightly better value in the price department.  That said... The food was great."}
{"text":"Spanish-Mexican fusion?! Yes.  Don't have to ask me twice as I have a special interest in Spanish cuisine.  With this fusion, you get fast service, but at a cost of quality.

This brick and mortar business should have gone the food truck route as the menu would easily fit the bill.  Instead, they operate inside a small, narrow building similar to one you see at Dutch Bros. Coffee.  

Let's not judge the book by its cover right? The menu is basically either a la carte or you can do a combo or \"flight.\"  The flight gets you 2 tacos of your choice + 1 tapa + 1 chips/salsa + 1 drink = approx $8.

What I enjoyed the best were their carne asada tacos.  The beef was cooked well, decent charred flavors.  As for tapa, I went with the chicken empanada which was mediocre at best.  In fact, everything was quite mediocre or below average, from the chips and salsa to croqueta, which is deep fried potato with ham.  The salsas were a big disappointment.  Lacked authenticity it seemed.  I assumed when your salsa has habanero in it, it be spicy and hot, yet all it did was cool my tongue! #fail 

One area that needs improvement in is in the food.  Service was nothing extraordinary.  Would I make a return, probably not.  It was worth a first try.  I really wanted it to stand out since I'm big into Spanish but it fell 2-stars short."}
{"text":"A fresh drive-thru taco stand sounded great and I was excited to try it, but sad to say I was disappointed. I am giving this place one star because I have no choice, but also for the super sweet and helpful cashier. Where do I begin... The drive-thru didn't work so that defeated the purpose of convenience. Our order was incorrect and our food was cold. The portions for the cost is not appropriate either. Overpriced and under delivered! Since its a new place, I can only hope it improves."}
{"text":"Got an invite to meet my son, wife and grandson for lunch. This is a fairly new place. The food was good and prices reasonably. 
This place is a small building. You order at a window. If you want to eat there you have a few tables. I think two or three to choose from. These are located outside in the Arizona heat. There is shade. But when it is 110 the shade does not make comfortable to eat outside. Most people were just ordering and taking it home, to their work place, eating in car. None of these being my choice. We ate there.
I believe there would be more people eating there if there was more seating outside and some misters. I will be back but after it cools off."}
{"text":"Typically the service and food is amazzzing, but this morning when I went (06/27/2018) the girl working the window was pretty rude, and they got my order wrong twice, and the second time I wasnt able to fix it because I'd assumed they'd simply added cheese to my burrito. Instead I got a pork (or chorizo) breakfast burrito when all I ordered was a steak breakfast burrito, and was told twice it was a steak breakfast burrito. Plus, looking at the receipt I realized they over charged me. Today left a bit of a sour taste in my mouth."}
