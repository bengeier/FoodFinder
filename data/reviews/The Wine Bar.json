{"text":"Came here with a friend after work. The place wasn't busy, but it was a Tuesday night. The waiter told us that it's a sharing menu and that we should start with 4 dishes and see how we feel after (good thing he didn't say 4 dishes each). So we agreed on the mushroom and eggplant soup (very good!), cheddar and green apple salad (equally good and fresh tasting), butternutsquash risotto with goat cheese and the ribs. The risotto was a bit salty and if by goat cheese they mean a tiny piece on top of risotto to decorate the dish, then that's what we got. Risotto wasn't al dente, but the butternutsquash was tasty. The ribs weren't the ribs I pictured. They were more Korean style, very thin slices of meet with a sweet marinate. The side dish (creamy polenta) was my fav! My friend kept getting tiny pieces of bone stuck in her teeth while eating the ribs (hmm, not good). For dessert we decided to go with the dark chocolate mousse. The color was not of a dark chocolate. It tasted okay, a bit too sweet for me. When I picture a dark chocolate dessert, it should taste a bit bitter. Overall, I might go there again for a glass of wine if other people are going, but I don't think I'd go there for their food again."}
{"text":"I ate at this place again in February 2010 and took a work colleague since I enjoyed so much the last time. It was even better the 2nd time, although sigh..they ran out of my fav. Duck Confit to early for me to get my 2nd order in

Remember it's Tapas style so if you go with a group, and like a dish, just order again. 

Love the Wine Somelier, very knowledgeable and let's face it, it's funny when austraulian guys talk...just to hear him ...

Let me know how you fare there..."}
{"text":"I love this place. The food was some of the best I've had since arriving in Toronto 3 weeks ago (and we've eaten out a lot). The portions were perfect for sharing and the wine list is impressive. We ordered 5 tapas between the two of us, all gluten-free, and were stuffed at the end. The service was attentive and awesome and even though it wasn't a packed room, they were still hustling, which is a good sign of front of house management. I would definitely recommend this place for either a small bite and a nice glass of wine or a full meal."}
{"text":"This was a wonderful find. We split the beef pontine, duck breast, and cheese plate. These were all small plates but exceptional in their detail. Service was attentive and genuine. We chose the locally grown Norman hardie Cabernet franc as accompaniment. Expensive but worthy of a treat."}
{"text":"Very disappointing...I love the idea of small portions and sharing, however portions seemed extra small and frankly, not that good. 
   There was a wide selection of wines, but all way over priced. We settled on a reasonably priced Ontario Chardonnay, only to find out it was the last bottle...not that it mattered, because we never saw the waiter again until we gave up and hailed him for the bill. One round of tapas and a bottle of wine for the five of us?...we left starving and considered the hotdog joint on the way to the car."}
{"text":"First time at The Wine Bar with 10 friends.  Very quiet evening for the restaurant which allowed seating at a large square table promoting engaging conversations.  Their menu changes daily; my favourite savoury tapas was the P.E.I Mussel Risotto and my favourite sweet tapas was the Banana Bread Pudding.  Overall, good food but a little on the pricey side!!!!"}
{"text":"Liked a decor in the restaurant. open kitchen is always nice to see chefs performance.
Seems like the menue changes often even though the restaurant is located in the downtown feels like more neighbour's restaurant. very cozy. Just way cold.

Service; 4 (we got there at 6;30)
Food;3.5 
 We shared a Anchovy and Heirloom tomato w/arugula salada.
 Main; Tenderloin stake and ribs(marinated with some kind of asian flavor but unfortunately was way  salty.  But the fried cornbread was awesome)
  ***We felt really cold once we got in. the food wasn't really \"hot\" more ..like a warm. so we thought had to eat quickly before it get really cold.

Drink; Very geniusly priced. 

I think this place might good to go like during a week night. but not so much of weekend night."}
{"text":"A Groupon offer persuaded us to buy not one but two deals at The Wine Bar. Because we live in nearby, we wanted to like it. But the only thing to like is the wine list. The food just doesn't have enough flavour. 

First dinner: Calamari looked pale and rubber; the beef cheeks tasted like my own cooking (heart in the right place, execution a little off the mark). When I sit down with a nice glass of wine, I want my meal to meet the same standard. I'd rather open a good bottle at home and phone out for pizza.

Second dinner: waiter tells us we've arrived early, then realizes their computer made a mistake. He grudgingly seats us and we wait too long for someone to take our order (is the computer in charge of this?). Most of what we order is pretty; with the exception of the flank steak, nothing has any depth of flavour. And because the steak hasn't been marinated, it's tough. No steak knives, either. For shame!

It's just not fun to eat here. Too many false notes. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Came here with a Buytopia coupon that was $69 for 2 glasses of wine 2 appetizers and 2 mains, and I was so impressed. The wine was a beautiful Gamay the service was amazing and the food even better. We had the mushroom toast that was so delicious and the butter chicken poutine that was amazing especially for someone who doesn't like butter chicken. Our mains were the steak which I have to say was probably one of the best steaks I have ever had. I will definitely be coming back without the coupon to try more food. Highly recommended and great wine selection"}
{"text":"I would actually give this place 3.5 stars if i could.

The place is cozy and the ambience truly is relaxing and comfortable. They have 1000 points tables on opentable.com which instantly earns my respect - anything for some of them points! :)

They were doing a summerlicious menu for $25 which was great but since we are not big on desserts (i know, quite alien of us) we decided to opt a-la-carte instead. 
I read the reviews prior that complained about the higher prices - i thought they were reasonably priced. Tapas plates started from $6 up to $16 a plate and the portions were a good size - very share-able. The food was good and we left content and not over stuffed - just the appropriate amount of full!

Tapas plates to share:
1) Butter Chicken poutine
it was quite literally butter chicken dropped on top of fries. Both dishes separately were good however i personally was not crazy about it together. It felt like eating to sepearte dishes. However, i still liked it since those are two of my favourites dishes/foods.

2) pear salad with cashew nuts
it was nice - light on the vinaigrette but paired very well with the pear and nuts

3) Lamb chops with red cabbage
was the best plate of the night - the lamb was well cooked and the red cabbage salad was unique and delicious.

4) Flank of steak with potato salad and carmelized onions
the onions were tough to slice to eat and the steak was good but not memorable. 

Its a good tapas place with a good ambience - nice date place in the heart of the St. Lawrence market. However, there are some really great tapas places in the city and The Wine Bar doesn't stand out amongst those."}
{"text":"Don't come here if you're hungry or broke.  Or if you're not a cheap date.

We weren't broke, but we could have eaten a cow.  It's not that the tapas were small portioned and expensive.  They were small portioned and ok priced.  It was the 13 dollar p/glass (and up) or the 10 dollar half glasses of wine pairings that we decided to indulge in for each tapas plate that broke the bill.

Ok, so we didn't have to do it that way. But we figured, why not?  They suggested pairings on the menu with each plate, and they know better, right?  

We had the poutine, duck, scallops, the cheese plate, and the expresso creme brulee.  Our favorite was the creme brulee....it was pretty amazing.  

The cheese plate came with 5 cheese items, and for each, they put down 5 glasses of wine for each pairing for the both of us.  That's 10 glasses of wine on our little table and a little plate of cheese.  Yeah, we looked like total lushes.

If you come here, try that creme brulee.  And if you feel like splurging and trying different wines, then go do the above route.  However, if there's a next time for me, I'll just do something normal like, get one carafe or something."}
{"text":"We had a great evening. The place is beautiful, very warm and elegant. Service and food were amazing. 
Wife and I set on the bar so were served by steve the barman whom was very nice, friendly and helpful.
We had a Groupon voucher so had a choice of two apps ( cheese plater and duck confide poutine) and two main ( steak and fish) all were excellent. Cheese cake and a bottle of wine wine ....what can I say, give it a chance, the place is a gem....would totally go back and glad we gave it a chance
Thank you"}
{"text":"Disappointing. I walk by here almost daily and thought it looked great: a classy wine bar with light eats. I made the mistake of recommending this restaurant for a group outting one night. 

Here were the issues, in order of their appearance:
1 - Our waiter smelled of alcohol. He also didn't seem to know very much about wine, which is odd given the restaurant's name would imply they'd be well-versed on it. 
2 - Our waiter never checked on our table for the entire three hours we were there. Pretty basic service to ask how the meal is, how the wine was tasting.
3 - All three waiters stayed at the end of the bar chatting the entire night. It took me several tries to flag them for water, for my friend to place an order our waiter missed, and to just get the bill so I could leave. Pretty amazing given we were one of only two parties in on a Thursday night.
5 - The food is terrible, delivery is worse. I ordered the pizza, which is actually a flatbread with pizza toppings. It was completely black on the bottom and sides and the wood board leaked juice onto the table. (Juice from what? I don't know.) I asked the waiter if they could remake it. A few minutes later, he brought me a flatbread that was so raw the dough was chewy and lukewarm and the cheese wasn't melted. The waiter gave it to me with attitude. I ate it because I didn't want to make a scene at the table with a group of people. I shouldn't have because I was sick all night. 
I contacted management about the experience and the response a few days later was a copy-paste apology. The owner showed no concern regarding the raw pizza and terrible service and made no effort to find out how they could best address the concerns and negative experience. 
Too bad. It was a fantastic restaurant with good quality food and top-notch service when it was owned by Jamie Kennedy a few years ago, according to one of my friends. I was looking forward to making this place a regular haunt. Maybe it'll get new management soon and I can revisit."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing food. Each dish was well seasoned and very flavourful. I would highly recommend the lobster taco appetizer, worth every bite.

The steak is also very unique. They put a green sauce that had a wadabi like so picyness to it that worked very well. They definitely know what they are doing. And of course the great selection of wine that hence the dinner experience."}
{"text":"Very nice ambiance; a cozy place.  The quality of the tapas fare, however, is somewhat incongruent with the price. Those sampled (poutine, duck, scallops) were all good, the service is fine, though its just difficult to recommend this place due to mismatch of cost and quality."}
{"text":"This sexy little spot is most ideal for intimate dates or small social gatherings. The staff all seem very knowledgeable about what they have to offer and are not at all forced or pretentious. Corking service is available for a moderate fee, but their wine list is so vast that you may prefer to go empty-handed and try some of the wines they have in house, especially the well-chosen wine pairing suggestions on the menu. Most wines they offer are only available by the bottle, but there is also a decent list available in smaller portions for those who want to try many different wines in one sitting. 

The menu is small yet tasteful, full of elegant, inspired ideas plus a few new takes on classics. Beautiful presentation and a nice variety of options for different tastes (including a lamb poutine with red wine sauce, perfect for the laid back guys in the group who are just looking for anything resembling pub fare!) The kitchen is open and we were lucky to get a table right next to it where we could smell everything and even peek over at what the chef was doing. I was visually impressed by almost everything that came out and everyone seemed thoroughly satisfied with what they ordered. The only thing that may need improvement is the chocolate mousse -- I didn't try it myself, but some of my friends ordered it and it came out looking slightly unappetizing, which is pretty difficult to do with anything chocolate!

It was a great experience and we all left in great spirits at the end of the night. I would definitely go there again, maybe on a date next time!"}
{"text":"Franchement à éviter et c'est bien dommage. Nous y sommes allés deux fois, en couple puis avec deux amis. 

En cuisine, on assure, on innove même. Le chef Bryan Burke est capable de proposer des mets exceptionnels comme des choux de Bruxelles frits avec câpres pour ne prendre que cet exemple. Le menu vous propose une sélection très intéressante de vins pour chaque mets. Voilà pour le positif. 

Le service laisse à désirer : arrogance, mépris, précipitation, interruptions constantes, retrait des plats avant qu'ils ne soient terminés. 

L'endroit est très bruyant. Si vous y allez un vendredi soir et que le restaurant est complet, le niveau de bruit devrait dépasser allègrement les 90 décibels: tables trop rapprochées, pas d'insonorisation et espace réduit."}
{"text":"Came to this place because they had the 1,000pt bonus on Open Table, but I'm glad I decided to give it a try. The curried chicken mac n cheese was GREAT. I really liked that. Also, I wasn't sure what glass of wine I wanted, so the bartender gave some great suggestions and let me taste a few and I was able to decide after that. I had a white (think it was Pinot Gris) from Ontario and it was really good. I would try this place again if I make it back to Toronto."}
{"text":"Friday night Jan 22, approximately 7pm, we were a group of 4. Maybe 7 couples were seated in the restaurant, it's a cute place.
Nice atmosphere but that's about it. The wine is overpriced for 5 oz glasses but they do seem to free pour and provide samples. I was given a vague description of the Chablis when asked (\"fresh and crispy\"). At the price point and it being a wine bar, the servers should be well versed in their basic wine menu.
We ordered the cheese plate to start which served a group of four reasonably. It came with two small flatbread crackers and grapes that were not fresh at all, it was the middle of winter but I wouldn't have plated that. Again, it's the price point. The server could not tell us about all of the cheeses in detail. At one point he said \"this is a Dutch, um, I can't remember...\"  and did not elaborate. The staff just seemed indifferent and only partially knowledgable of the menu. 
Main: My husband and I had a beet and goat cheese salad which was over dressed so it was soggy at the bottom. We both had the scallops with chickpea ratatouille. The scallops were not seared well, they were stringy and smelled fishy. The chickpeas were hard, the diced tomatoes had too much juice and tasted as if it came from a can. Cooking chickpeas sufficiently and fresh tomatoes are not going to break the bank. My husband asked if they had bread to soak up the juice and the waitress said she'd see if they if baguette to bring over. He received two pieces of bread, no one else was given or offered any. My parents both had the the lamb, and while I cannot say how the lamb was, the potatoes had a ton of undercooked garlic in it with way too much butter. Needless to say the food was sub-par (amateur) and would have been at half the price, nonetheless $27 - $30 a meal. When we had finished, the empty plates (with bones) sat in front of us, my father ordered a coffee and finished it, and we received the dessert menus all the while the dishes were still there. Will never return."}
{"text":"Got a groupon from here ($89 for dinner for two- includes 2 apps, 2 mains, one dessert, and imone bottle of wine) and it was really really worth it! The food exceeded my expectations. The ambiance is nice, chic, fancy but it was dead when we went- monday night, of course. Otherwise every food item we got was quality stuff: the calamari appetizer was very nice and savoury, the crab and lobster croquette pretty good; for the mains the lamb rack was delicious, well cooked, and the potatoes it comes with is moist sweet, the beef rib was fall-off-the-bone tender but heavy to eat alone, better to share it with another meal otherwise u get sick of it, and the creme brulee dessert was decadentttt buttery sweet smooth taste. All in all, it was well worth the groupon. The groupon was valued around $ 160. Would i pay $160 for this whole meal (which includes a bottle of red or white) ? We valuated our food part alone to come to roughly $80-$85, so it's like the wine wouldve cost a remaining $80? I think for the groupon price it's worth it, it's like getting free bottle wine. Otherwise just food alone i guess it's still the right price for the quality although i would probably only come here on special romantic occasion cuz a tad pricy for me hehe but dont get me wrong, it's great quality!"}
{"text":"Disappointing on multiple fronts.

I used to love this place when Jamie Kennedy was managing, but much has been lost in the transition.  We ordered the grilled hanger steak and found it extremely tough, difficult to cut and chew.  The fish was bland and the service frenetic.  The only highlight was the yukon gold fries.  In short, I would not recommend the Wine Bar as better food and value exists in many other places."}
{"text":"The first time that my fiancé and I tried to make a reservation here, they confirmed a reservation on Sunday, so when we went, the place was closed. But we sent an email about this issue and they apologies and let us use our groupon on Saturday since we didn't have opportunity during the week and the coupon was about to expire. So we appreciate that they assumed their mistake.

The wine selection is good, the appetizers were amazing (lobster and crab croquets and Brie cheese), the dessert was also good (cinnamon churros), the entrees were really disappointing (lamb chops and the striploin), really over cooked with charred areas and a terrible after taste."}
{"text":"I came here at the suggestion of my friend who lives within 4 minutes of The Wine Bar. This was my first time here and first impressions were dark, woodsy, and modern décor. I arrived first and was seated in a little alcove where everyone else was sitting -  for a Monday night it was quite busy!

As the name suggests, The Wine Bar does offer many glasses of wine in 3oz and 6 oz size. The price of the 6oz portion varies from $12 - $24. I had a glass of the Maconne which can be considered a Super Tuscan so in this sense it was nice to try a glass, but expensive. For main course my friend and I had the Yukon Fries which comes with Ketchup, Mayo, and Spicy Aoili; Beet Risotto; Chorizo; and Fried Calamari. I have to admit that every dish was average...nothing out of the ordinary. For dessert, we had the bread pudding which was by far the best dish of the night in my mind. Needless to say, this isn't a dinner venue, but rather, a pop-in for a bite and a drink place. And because of that, it's not bad. If you wanted to have a glass of wine and some nibbles in proper style before a show at The Sony Center, then this place would be great. 

Service was efficient and the bill came out to almost $100 plus tax and tip for two so this place is not the cheapest."}
{"text":"My wife and I had gone there to try the resto since it changed from Jamie Kennedy.   The service and food were fine and until I wanted to used my groupon (which was the only reason that made me want to try that resto again).  They refused to honor it citing reasons of small print and that it applied to the regular menu, which wasn't available for a few more months due to the summerlicious menu.

Your money is better spent elsewhere that can easily provide a better eating experience for less money.  Try Table 17 instead, delicious food and they provide corkage as well so you can have your favorite bottle of wine with the duck and risotto."}
{"text":"I can see why they have a Groupon deal for this place now. Appetizer was alright but my main course (ravioli) came out cold because they were waiting for the other course to be ready as well. Chocolate cream brûlée tasted like chocolate pudding with melted sugar on top. Service was garbage. Will not come back. Thank goodness it was just a groupon."}
{"text":"I have passed by this restaurant various times but was never compelled to actually dine there. Then came a $89 Groupon for dinner for two which included two appetizers, 2 mains, 1 dessert and a bottle of wine.

It seemed like a great deal and since we were attending a concert at the Sony Centre just down the road we bought the groupon. I made reservations by emailing the restaurant and got a response back right away.

Upon arrival the restaurant had 1 other couple other than my friend and I. The waitress was very nice, explained to us how the groupon works and bought out a bottle of Nua Brut Prosseco which is $50 on their wine list! I was really impressed that this was included in the groupon!

For our apps I ordered the duck confit tacos and my friend got the Quebec crispy fried brie. Both were really good. The duck was moist and well accompanied by fresh  tomato  & cilantro  salsa,  shaved  baby  spinach and habanero cheddar. The red taco shells were very light and crispy and supposedly house made chimichurri  sour cream. My friend's dish was crunchy on the inside and melty goodness on the inside.

For our mains I got the Grilled  Moroccan  Lamb Skewers which was really nothing special. It was tough and had chunks of fat that I had to spit out. However my friend's dish which I got a taste of was heaven!!! She got the seared scallops which were perfectly cooked and served with a pickled corn. I definitely regretted my choice after tasting hers.

For dessert we shared the triple chocolate cheesecake which was ok.

Overall I still liked the experience even considering some of the flaws. The bottle of prosseco, the tasty starters, the scallops and the super friendly service made the night.

As a note, all their dishes are plated to share and they have free corkage on Mondays. 

I would definitely come back, especially for the scallops!!"}
{"text":"The best wine bar/tapas place in the world---flat out! This place is totally happening. I got there at 5 and was the first person in the joint and asked if I could sit and have, you know, wine. The guy spent a minute or so trying to find unreserved seats AT THE BAR! Yikes! I did, er, I mean, they did....and proceeded to have the best time of my life at a place like this. I almost shoo'ed my driver away at 9!"}
{"text":"Had dinner there this past weekend, there were four of us. Bottom line, wine was very good food was just ok.

Portions were very small; too small. Even ordering 6 tapas as they recommend for 4 people was barely enough.  Also, all those plates just do not fit on the table.  We spent a good part of our evening shifting plates and dealing with space issues so we did not end up with food on our laps .

Service was very good, so credit there.

Tips: lamb is not that good; avoid it. Brie was good as was the cheese plate.  For the money though, you get more and better food elsewhere."}
{"text":"I would actually give this a 3.5 if I could.

A friend and I went to use a Groupon on a Wednesday night. The place was really quiet, and we were the only ones sitting at the bar. As a result we got our waiter/bartender's full attention, which was great. I was excited to try this place because I am a wine nerd. The guy behind the bar was really enthusiastic about wine and let us try a bunch of them to decide whether or not we wanted to commit to a glass, which was nice because the wine is pricey. They have some amazing non-LCBO wines, but you are definitely paying a premium for them.

I can't really comment on the food -- we were mostly there to drink -- but we did have the seafood chowder which was tasty and seriously full of seafood. 

The ambiance was great -- dark wood and colours and as many other reviewers mentioned, would be a great place for a date.

So to sum up, amazing wine, really good service, but it's priced accordingly!"}
{"text":"Celebrated a Birthday with friends at the Wine Bar.

With our reservation, we were seated in a more private area of the restaurant (nice wall of wine behind us).  Ambiance is nice - dark, romantic mood lighting, candle lights....

I say the Wine Bar is more of a late night (snacks & drinks) place, rather than having  full dinner. 

Portion sizes are quite small.  We knew it was Tapas style; however, still felt that the plates could have been improved. For example, the seared scallop dish came with ONE scallop. Just one lonely guy.

Lots of good drinks/wine selection available in 3oz or 6oz.. The menu has pairing recommendations - great if you like variety.

Some of the highlights were the butternut squash risotto and the artisan cheese platter. However, I don't recommend the sausage and bean poutine or the short ribs. They weren't great.

Flow of the food was slightly off. Our waiter mentioned that our dishes would come out slowly, rather than all at once. But after we placed our order 70% of our dishes came at once; then, we waited quite a while before the remaining ones. It was odd.

Costs run between $5-$15 per dish. Expect to spend over $50+ for your meal (our waiter recommended 2-3 tapas per person)."}
{"text":"Had a really great time here on a Saturday night.

Although located close to lots of things, it's feel like it's off the beaten path.  Decor is gorgeous, atmosphere in side is really nice.  We got seated in a great seat, in a wine-walled alcove.  If you make a reservation, ask for the bath portion of the room.  Bar seating did look nice, they have two bars, one that faces the kitchen/chefs, one that's more a traditional bar.  

Service was genuine.  Our server wasn't really in our face -- which is nice if you're trying to have a romantic, private night.  He didn't offer much guidance in terms of how much to order (the restaurant is sharing-plate style - don't know why so many restaurants misuse the word tapas, but in this case, they mean you are meant to order many dishes and share).   Menu changes frequently so what I had may not be what you can have, but I would recommend everything we ate.  We paced it out so we shared three courses and three glasses of wine to match those; then another 3 with some other wine; then a dessert (dessert was the best course, which I never say when dining out!).   We never felt rushed.  We were there almost 3 hours, which is so nice on a Saturday evening.  

Overall, I'd highly recommend this as a date-night spot or for an anniversary.  Corkage fee is $30, should you want to bring your own.  They do give samples out for free, so feel free to try a few wines before you commit!"}
{"text":"Nothing about this place was terrible, but nothing was great either. The service was slow and the staff aloof. It seemed like we were putting them out by being there. They weren't overtly rude, just really cold. 

The small plates were passable but smaller than expected (and I am a huge fan of the small plates movement). Wine was fine not not unbelievable. Prices were higher than quality and quantity would dictate. In a city like Toronto, you can do better."}
{"text":"Great Find!
We were looking for a quaint restaurant for Valentines Day and we found one. The Wine Bar is much more than just its wine - the food was fabulous. But of course the wine selection was tremendous and if you wanted to bring your own wine, there was a standard corkage fee available. A nice option when you want to have your best wine with great food and with people that appreciate good wine. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"i came here on a Friday night. it was summerlicious and we decided to try it. I had the apple salad which was quite good, but it went downhill from there.
I ordered the ribs, but i can't eat potatoes. the waiter said I could not substitute it. the dish came with 2 small thin pieces of spare ribs, which you can find better in a food court. taste and portions aside, a food court would still garnish better in the Styrofoam box.
lemon creme brulee tasted artificial and left much to be desired. 

ate crackers when I got home."}
{"text":"Came to Wine Bar with my co-workers for some Summerlicious lunching.  The restaurant itself is rather small, with the bar being the focal point of the restaurant.   It is owned by the same owner as Hank's and the Great Burger Kitchen.

Our orders were promptly taken, though the order to table speed in which the food arrived was rather slow (so if you work on a punch card system, this is not the place for you to eat lunch!)  The portion sizes left more to be desired as all 3 of us left feeling as if we could eat more.  But then again, this is a tapas/wine bar - so I suppose its forgivable.

For starters the following were ordered: chilled asparagus soup, mini burger poutine and a broccoli salad.  Of the 3, I ordered the salad and it was quite tasty.  The broccoli was blanched and sprinkled with almonds and raisins with a honey balsamic vinaigrette.

For mains we ordered: salmon open-faced sandwich, wild mushroom cakes and grilled quail.  I knew that the quail would be small, so I didn't order it because I knew it would not fill me, so I opted for the salmon open-faced sandwich. It 1/8 of a whole baguette in size, topped with some average smoked salmon (even store-bought stuff has more smoked flavour than this stuff!), and spread with some dill spread.  It was quite tasty as a sandwich, I only wish the serving size was a little more generous.  The grilled quail was indeed tiny, though my co-worker did comment that it was quite tasty.  The mushroom cakes were really tasty and was held together by some sort of creamy, glutinous ingredient that I suspect was a mix of flour and potatoes?

My favourite part of the meal was dessert.  I ordered the Chocolate Tart, which came with the thinnest crust possible.  I really hope that I will be able to find the recipe someday.  It wasn't buttery like most tart recipes, nor flaky like phyllo... It had me guessing as to how it was made.  But I didn't care - a thin crust meant that there would be more chocolate filling!  It was extremely good - a dense chocolate tart, but it wasn't heavy nor too sweet.  I absolutely adored the chantilly cream.  The Niagara Sour Cherry Bread Pudding was also ordered.  This was served with a rum-butter sauce.  My co-worker's only regret is that the serving size was so small.  She wanted seconds!Last but not least, a Peanut Butter Crème Brûlée.  How could you go wrong? What a genious idea to incorporate peanut butter.  This was served with an almond shortbread cookie. 

Verdict:

Good food, but small portions.  The service was good, but slow.  Would probably come back here for tapas and wine, but not for an actual meal."}
{"text":"Love the concept - Canadian tapas.  I really liked the andouille sausage and the mini bread that comes with it.  They, of course, have excellent wine selection.  The fried chicken slider was also tasty.

Even though the place was empty, the decor and ambiance were both super attractive.  The service was attentive, but that is probably because we were one of two parties there."}
{"text":"Just spent New Year's Eve at the wine bar and hank's. 

Wine bar was great with their prix fixe menu of $50. 5 courses with an amuse bouche, intermezzo and prosecco. The ambiance was really great. We were a big group of 10 and were able to chat the whole time.

My personal favourites were the scallops, potato leek soup, duck terrine and cheesecake! The menu always changes so you may not get the chance to order them.

They transformed Hank's into a night club/lounge after the event. It was awesome with a live DJ and a great sophisticated crowd. 

Cheers! Looking forward to next year."}
{"text":"This is a great place for a quite dinner. Ambiance is beautiful and relaxing.
Service was very fast, faster than a fast food place, for lack of words. The waitress was very nice and warm.
I am not expert on wine, but the selection is not your typical LCBO selection.

We have orders several dishes, steak was tender and tasty, I really recommend it, but the scallop was even better, probably best I have ever had.

Prior to visiting the place, I have checked out the reviews on Yelp, some customers were complaining about the food portions, so I went to the wine bar with that review in mind, but once we ordered the food, it became clear to us that those reviews were not fair, the portions were right, this a tapas place, if you honestly concerned  about the food portions, then tapas is not for you. 

One thing I have in mind after I visited this place is that this place is all about taste and beatiful ambiance."}
{"text":"Really looked forward to trying out this place, but was quite disappointed.

The food was mediocre and service was horrible"}
{"text":"My review is based on a Wine Bar/ Hank's experience in November, 2015. We actually hosted an event here.

We hosted our event in Wine Bar while Hank's was open and when Wine Bar opened, we moved over to Hank's. I'll enumerate my pleased-ness.

1) They were really helpful with letting me store things at the venue (for at least a few hours - all I needed) before the event actually happened. Extremely great since I had enormous projectors.

2) They were helpful with my setup (of said projectors) even of things that had nothing to do with them (like, again, the projectors).

3) They were helpful with the tear-down. We really pushed our rental time in Wine Bar to the limit, staying probably 10-15 minutes past the time they told us to move to Hank's - despite the fact that it gave them just a tiny window to set up

4) Everything was delicious!

5) They opened Wine Bar for us before it was actually open and they opened Hank's for us after it was actually closed. So, so great.

6) Service with the food and drinks we ordered was phenomenal.

7) When we had money left to reach our minimum after the reception was over at Hank's, they allowed us to dine at Wine Bar to reach the minimum. So generous!

I think that's it. I wouldn't recommend an event where you need Internet here (unless you have a hotspot) because it's not the best reception, but it's otherwise really great. I'd definitely have another event here (if Internet was not required) and eat more of their delicious food."}
{"text":"Went here for summerlicious menu last year (I've had this review under the wrong resto for the past year in case you are wondering about the delay)

We made reservations, but our table was not ready when we arrived. We were politely seated at the bar. Understandably it was busy. We waited ~30 min. We were checked on a couple times which was nice. What was even nicer, is when they sat us, they gave us each a small glass of wine on the house, to apologize for the wait.

Great touch. Totally turned our mood around. Restaurants should really do this more often. Its a small gesture, but makes a huge difference. We felt like valued customers :).

I had the smoked salmon on potato patty (my indian background tempts me to call it an aloo tikki but that was not the name they used!) as appetizer. It ended up being my favourite part of the meal. Followed by steak dinner-they didnt ask how I wanted it, and luckily it came out medium rare, as I like. It was...chewy. It was...tasty. But alas nothing too exciting. For dessert, I had the strawberry creme brule. It was delicious, but tasted more like a well flavoured pudding, and had the texture of such, vs actual thick and creamy creme brule. 

For $25, excellent summerlicious menu. Good serving sizes. On the flavour side...it could be slightly better.

My favourite part of Local Kitchen, apart from the amazing waiter service (they brought our meals quickly and were very attentive, filling our water etc) was the ambience. They lighting and decor is very chill, almost a lounge vibe (without crazy dance music in the background). I would go back here for drinks at the bar...or some wine :)"}
{"text":"I'm surprised at some of the reviews here! We really enjoyed the wine bar. 

We had a groupon, 2 apps, 2 mains, dessert and a bottle of wine. 

Beautiful restaurant. We had the Angel's Gate Cabernet blend to start, which we both loved and have been trying to find in an LCBO ever since. For apps, we shared the baked Brie and the pear salad. Both were delicious. 

I had the butternut squash ravioli which we both LOVED. My dining partner tried the lamb stew which neither of us enjoyed. We had bread pudding for dessert which was delicious. 

The service was excellent. Wine and food was great. we left full and pleased with our experience. I would definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Great wine place. Shared the scallops and steak, they were both delicious and we topped it off with peanut butter creme brulee. First time I had brulee and I'm sure it set a high standard for my brulee going forward. I recommend this place if your looking for a nice chill place with great food paired with excellent wine."}
{"text":"Ever since my first review a year and a half ago I've been about a 8-10 times and I wouldn't change a thing about what I first said. It's very consistently delicious and the waiters now know me and seat me at my favorite spot (kitchen bar) upon entering. Only If I lived in Toronto... Le Sigh...."}
{"text":"3.5 STARS

This is a cute and cozy place that is wine first and food second!  They have a decent wine list and the servers really know their wine so if you have any questions they can definitely lead you into the right direction.  The food here is small plates/tapas styles...so to be honest...you may need to eat before or after as well.  A little too small if you are HUNGRY....but if you just want some nibbles with your wine..well then you will be fine.  The butter chicken poutine was lovely as well as the seafood platter (shrimps, lobster croquettes, smoked salmon..etc).  It's small but lends itself to a nice relaxing atmosphere.  You can also sit at the bar and watch the chefs prepare your meal right in front of you.

So for a fun evening I say check this place out...wine not? (lol yes bad joke inserted there)"}
{"text":"\"Great local spot for a date night with wine, local fare and freshness\"

I've been here a few times before and have always left happy and full. Each time has been a date night, two times with the aid of groupon which included 3 course meal and bottle of wine.

This place is part of the same ownership group who owns Hanks next door and the burger place last I checked so good is always fresh and tasty.

Atmosphere

Nice mix of old and new wood accents combined with some clever use of the space and decor elements and it is a nice place to sit and have a meal before a night out or after a work day. Which is why I recommend it for a date night. Good lighting and casual or slightly upscale casual with parking all over.

Food

The wine bar is proud to serve many local dishes including pork belly, short rib, rib eye, and lobster most of which is as local as possible (Ontario for example).

Calamari and croquet appetizers were nice flavourful with a nice vinaigrette and mushroom sauce respectively. The pork belly lobster dish was both crispy and creamy and very filling. With the lamb dish being both fresh and aromatic. The critique I have is the lobster dish should've included the claw and not the tail with the meat being pre pulled or shelled as it was very messy to take apart. Also the lamb and side were both tasty but could've used a little less time in the oven as it was just overdone.

Other than that is be happy to go back and try the other proteins as they all seemed quite appealing

Value

You'll be looking at roughly $40 - $50 each which includes wine and that's not bad. Sometimes the restaurant has a BYOB day where their corkage fee is reduced. Given that we used a groupon I was happy with the selection from the regular menu and he service. Would come back again.

Was going to rate this 3.5 but will bump to 4 instead of down because food was pretty good combined with the rest of the experience."}
{"text":"Went here again this week. For the month of July they have a \"G-ate\" promotion - $25 for 3 courses. Basically trying to support businesses that lost money during the summit. However, depending on what you order, 3 \"courses\" may not fill you up. The ravioli for instance, was literally 3 pieces of average-sized ravioli on a bed of veggies. For $10, that was pretty steep. The delicious fries offered the most bang for your buck - a good-sized mini-bucket for $6, served with delicious spiced aioli, herb mayo, and homemade ketchup. Food was good but I felt like the portions have decreased significantly since my last visit. 
I do like the fact that the menu changes daily, so you can go back and try totally different things."}
{"text":"Also came here on a Groupon, no issues using it. Redeemed just using my iPhone too, didn't need to print it off.

Lovely setting, the jars of preserves on the wall are really neat! Very nice wine list, great variety.

I was REALLY excited to try the scallops, but they did not have it on the menu. Waiter talked them up for a few minutes only to come back later to say they didn't have them, and was an old menu. He then replaced the menu with a newer version which didn't include the scallops, but did include a great pork loin. 
Cheddar and Apple salad was quite good!
Service was attentive, and relatively quick. 

Moderately disappointed with the flatbread, it was cold! How can it have melted cheese on it, but be cold?! Fail.

Seems to be a reoccurring theme with reviews on here that one hand doesn't talk to the other. 

May return...but like sushi places, there are tons of wine bars out there."}
{"text":"Very disappointing. We love tapas bars and bought a Groupon to check it out. The restaurant was pretty dead at 730pm on a Friday, but it still had a nice ambience and lighting and we were greeted warmly. We started with the Philly Steak poutine and a bottle of Australian Shiraz, which was a very nice start to the meal, but it went all down hill from there. We then had the Chorizo Crostini which was disgusting. The crostini was stale, and in the middle of the plate were soggy vegetables as decoration!? Who wants soggy cauliflower with Chorizo? We than had the Scallops which were way too salty and the zucchini was overcooked and then the Steak, which was tough and unappetizing , and the sweet potato sauce accompanying it had no consistency and was flavourless. Our service was incredible which ended up being one of the only reasons we still had a great night despite the disappointing food. It's a cute place with a lot of potential, but they really need to rethink that menu."}
{"text":"I super love this place!
I love the atmosphere, the food, the service, everything!
I went here about a year ago and I was just blown away! We sat by the bar where the chefs cook and it was really awesome to see them while I drank wine. My boyfriend and I tried about 4 of dishes and we couldnt decide which one we liked the best because they were all so good. Everyone was also super nice and really paid attention to us. 
I cant wait to go back the next time I visit Toronto."}
{"text":"I would be more inclined to give this place 3-1/2 stars, but since that's not possible, I'm rounding down. 

I went here for Sunday lunch with a group for Winterlicious. For $15 we got a choice of appetizer, entree and dessert. 

We arrived first and our table was waiting for us. The restaurant was not busy at that point and our waiter was very attentive with water and the wine menu.

Once our party finally arrived we all ordered. I had their Chipotle Sweet Potato & Goat Cheese Dip, which was average. The salads looked much better and got better reviews. Same with the soup. The dip was literally a dollap of dip at the side of the plate with some crostinis on the other end and 1 piece of pickled cauliflower and a few slices of onion in the middle. The dip was good, the pickled cauliflower alright. It was nice when all combined on the crostini (pickled veggies, dip on top of crostini). 

I had originally wanted to order the double pork slider, but I saw it arrive at someone else's table and it was literally just the one, single mini pork sandwich, with a few thinly cut fries at the side. It looked good, but it was appetizer size, IF THAT. The chicken sandwich was more reasonably sized, so I ordered that. It was good. I really liked the bread. The macaroni was also more reasonably sized. I sampled it and it was fine. Didn't blow me away. 

Dessert was the highlight of the meal for everyone I think. Some people ordered the mousse, which I thought was fine, but the people who ordered it loved, so there you have it. My husband loved his apple terrine, which I tried and was good. I liked the flavour of my creme brule very much, but the top was over toasted and had hardened to the consistency of a thin, hard candy. It was hard to break with my spoon and got stuck in my teeth. 

The service was consistently good, so no complaints there. None of us had wine with our lunch (although some had other drinks), so I can't comment there. 

This is a tapas bar, so I expect sizes to be small. BUT when sizes are small I expect them to be priced accordingly and/or to be in sharable portions. They gave the prices of each dish if you were to purchased them individually. These would all be hard to share and wouldn't really be worth it. They are nice as a Winterlicious meal, but I'm not sure this would be my first choice to go back to."}
{"text":"I wish I could balance this review with pros and cons but to be frank there is really no downside to this place.

Right from the moment I sat down the service was five-star. The  wine list is imaginative and features a good balance of local and appropriate. However if you ask what you're looking for suddenly you be poured a glass that is not on the menu. Pretty much the best way to attract a wino :-)

The food menu is equally imaginative and focuses on local and sustainable goods prepared to perfection! The only criticism Is the lack of baguette to accompany each of the fantastic dishes. However when I requested some baguette, it appeared quickly, my dish went back bone dry :-)

If you like a fantastic wine list and an adventurous food menu, this place is a must!"}
{"text":"It's kinda nice to be able to sit at the bar and watch the food being made, but sometimes it isn't. I remember learning when working in food service not to use my cell phone and touch food right after because it's unsanitary. Unfortunately the intoxicated man making our food didn't get that memo, or didn't care. And yes, he appeared to be drunker than any of the 8 patrons in the restaurant, throwing stuff around like he really didn't wanna be there. 

I thought it would be exciting to watch staff prepare food but this wasn't like other places. That part of it was really boring and kinda sad. The cooks appeared to hate their jobs, especially the drunk one. Why would a restaurant put people on display who obviously hate the work they do? Doesn't it make everyone look bad?

The wine was delicious. They had a sale on their overstock fancier bottles.

Our server was friendly. Food came out at a good pace. 

The lamb poutine was pretty good. The crispy kale salad was strange and it felt like I was eating salad topped with flavourless kale chips from a health food store. The spring roll was quite good, and the coleslaw that accompanied the steak was delicious. The steak was pretty decent too. the shoestring fries were kinda weird. I guess I like a more substantial, less deep-fried-to-a-crispy-death potato. 

The cheese plate was ok. A couple were delicious but one of the cheeses was so hard and bland I was shocked that it would be in such a restaurant. Obviously the drunk guy I witnessed cutting the cheese plate with his dirty cell phone hands didn't care too much about the quality of the cheese he put on the plate and put chunks of the refrigerator-hardened pieces. That's such a rip off. 

The wine is the highlight of this place. I don't think this place is good value for money. If you go you may not want to sit at the bar and watch them prepare your food. I probably would've given them a higher rating if I didn't see the drunk cook and his cell phone hands man handling chunks of the dried cheese they served us... 

Overall kinda weird and disappointing but the DELICIOUS wine gave me a good buzz so I still had a good time. Great wine and the friendly service helped improve this somewhat disappointing experience.

If you're a wine snob, this is a good place. The wine definitely overshadows the food. Makes sense; this place is called Wine Bar not Food Bar."}
{"text":"the wine is pretty good, but the food is atrocious, and that takes away from the wine drinking experience. the poutine is perhaps the sorriest effort i have ever seen in a nicer toronto restaurant -- just cheap fries with a bit of melted (melted!) cheese on top, with non-descript other stuff. the server couldn't seem to figure out what soup they were serving, and when they finally brought it out, it had changed again! and yet instead of telling us beforehand, they brought it out. 

sigh.

i wanted to like the place, but it needs a lot of work. ONLY drink the wine."}
{"text":"Expensive, but enjoyable.

Regular 6oz glass of wine will cost you anywhere from 15-20 dollars. Half litre 50 to 80 dollars. Each tapa is small in proportion and also approximately $12-$15 dollars.

I love the food there though. We had the risotto, steak, duck, and peanut butter creme brulee. The risotto was really good, but i didnt like the mix of goat cheese. The steak only came in two pieces, but the best of the three tapas we got. The duck was made well. I loved the peanut butter creme brulee...couldn't stop eating it!

Service was mediocre for the price. Wine is as expected."}
{"text":"Meh, for an upscale restaurant, I expect better.

Not that the food was bad, it was pretty good, albeit overly salty. For the price that we were paying, I wanted to be amazed. We overheard another couple ask about the pre-fixe dinner, which our waiter had failed to tell us. The pre-fixe ended up being a much better deal as you could get three different small plates for $25. If we hadn't asked for the pre-fixe, we would have gotten only two of the plates for $26 or $27. The Wine Bar offers half-glass options, which make it easy to do a wine pairing with each little plate. 

We had the flat bread, fries, scallops, perch, goat cheese ravioli, and the rib eye steak. And then we had the pavlova with strawberries for dessert. All of the small plates were good, but not particularly creative or interesting. In general, I felt that I could have eaten what I had there anywhere else. The food was overly salty, even for restaurant fare. The pavlova was way too sweet. I did really love the homemade ketchup that they served with the fries. The ketchup was thick and luscious, with a very good mouth feel. I truly felt the umami soul in the ketchup. But you wouldn't come here, just for the ketchup.

While not a bad dining experience, I don't feel that The Wine Bar warrants a visit. It's seems overpriced for what you get. 

I asked my companion how he felt about dinner and he responded with, \"The company was better.\""}
{"text":"I went here with a few friends and there were tumbleweeds blowing through the place!  It has a nice and cozy ambience, and the wines are really nice, as are the staff, who were very attentive.  However, the food was average at best (we ordered several appetizers) and I left slightly hungry."}
{"text":"Just came back from the wine bar. Peanut butter brulee... wow"}
{"text":"Wine selection was great as was the food!  We shared a Brie Two Ways, Grilled Calamari and the Lobster and Pork Belly.  It was a quiet night, and we enjoyed chatting with the chef while he was cooking in the open kitchen.  Would definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"Pretty good, but it'll cost ya.

The French fries, came with a great trio (aioli was our favourite).
Our bill came to $89 + taxes, + tip.  For two people.  We had 6 main dishes, and 2 desserts.

Service was nice, but then the restaurant became busier (Hanks opened up - and our waitress was shared with that other restaurant).

Food was very good, but if you are at all a strict vegetarian or vegan, look elsewhere.  

I had the lemon on shortbread (puckeringly lemony), my companion had the mocha creme brulee.

Washrooms were clean, and the restaurant's whole ambience was very warm, inviting, and fun. 

pros: good & quality food, good service, nice decor;
cons: costly, a drag to walk to while we're TTCing it and it happens to be raining outside."}
{"text":"I went here for a private party and the staff and food were exceptional.  We had various tappas style treats from a corn dog that had jalapeño in it to poutine, amazing lamb sliders and chicken sliders to name a few of the items.  The staff at bar and wait staff were so friendly and seem to like what they are doing.  Solid team of staff there and can't wait to go for dinner one of these days."}
