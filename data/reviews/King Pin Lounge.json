{"text":"Inexpensive, great way to have family fun. It is away from the casino part, so it doesn't even feel like going to a casino. We love to bowl and this place is great. They have enough smaller bowling balls, so I always get one. At other bowling alleys, they often do not have the size 8's. But here, not a problem. Another plus, you can catch a movie afterwards!"}
{"text":"Sunset Station is a Palace of Entertainment in the City of Henderson. When I want to feel like a King for an hour or two King Pin Lounge is one of the Sunset Station bars I will hang out in.

  Sunset Station can also be seen as a mall of bars. King Pin Lounge is the bar adjacent to the Strike Zone Bowling Center ( just like in the other Station casinos). It is a bar where I enjoy a $3 Bud Light draft while taking in the bowling scene. Their Blue Hawaiins and Spicy Bloody Marys are likewise decent. I see bowling alleys are upbeat places. There is something nice about the sound of a ball barrelling through an alley crashing into pins. Whether I am just hanging out or bowling, I enjoy drinking a cold one around all this upbeat energy. 

  Because Sunset Station is a Palace of Entertainment with a focus on gaming, the majority of its bar stools overlook a Game Maker machine. This is also an advantage to the patron. From my experience here, when the bar tender saw me gambling ($5 at digital Keno), the Bud Lights have been on the house. Disparite from Rosalita's Cantina at the far end of the casino,  the bartender has passed over mandating maximum betting. The disadvantage to the patron is that the machines appear to be the tightest machines in Sunset Station.

 King Pin Lounge is also a bar to view sports. There are HD TVs throughout the bar. From the back stools I would look up to see a professional sports game on the HD TV above and bowlers straight ahead.

 In addition to being a bar, King Pin Lounge is a decent hangout spot. There are a couple of arcade games, a pool table, and a neat bowling pin chandelier. 

  Service is hit and miss. Sometimes I have to wait for the bartender.  Other times the bartender is assertive with bringing drinks.

  When I review bars, I strive to take into consideration the opportunities for sobering up when I incorporate the rating. Before I wrap up this review, I will mention that if the water has been flowing too fast that there are plenty of opportunities to sober up. Bowling could be fun when your buzzed. There is a state-of-the-art Regal cinemas. If your hungry the Grand Cafe and a couple food court restaurants are open 24 hours. And there is always the option of spending the night in a Sunset Station hotel room"}
{"text":"We had a birthday party here and we had a blast. The employees that worked here were friendly and helpful. This isn't a place that a professional bowler would come to bowl (i think). The lane that we were on slanted to the left. Maybe that is how all bowling lanes are? Like I said, I'm not a pro. What this place is, is just awesome for kids. 

After you pay for your lanes your assigned area and use the little screen attached to the table to enter your names. You will have options to have bumpers pop up for your kids so they won't have gutter balls. You can also adjust scores and even change the theme of the game. They have several options to choose from. 

The place was nice and clean. Everything that we used worked which tells me they have good maintenance. The restroom were clean also. 

One of the only things I didn't like was in the middle of the bowling ally there was a bar and it had a strong smoke smell coming from it."}
