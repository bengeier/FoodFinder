{"text":"Expensive for what it is! We were on a hurry and they promised us they could be fast enough but they almost forgot us at our table. The food was disappointing too especially for the price"}
{"text":"Sorta ended up her by accident, but what a great accident!  It's literally right next to Salle Wilfrid Pelletier, so if you are going to a show it's a top place for a pre-show dinner.    We went for lunch after an event and it was great!  I had a seafood casserole that was really tasty while other people also enjoyed what they had.  One person had a quiche they said was fantastic and another had a chicken salad type dish that they enjoyed.    The service, again, was fantastic, they were friendly, polite, and very prompt.  They were also more than happy to speak to us in English, which normally wouldn't be a big deal but my elderly grandparents were with us and they struggle with French.  My only concern was the price.  What we had would have been something off a dinner menu, if they are going to be open for lunch they should look into a lunch menu.  I also thought that what I paid ($26.00 + tax) was a bit steep for what I had and others were thinking the same way, so that is the only thing keeping this review from being a 5 star."}
{"text":"Excellent souper hier à ce restaurant,avant un concert de jazz à la PDA. Foie de veau tendre, délicieux accompagné des traditionnels oignions. Ma compagne a choisi les côtelettes d'agneau qui, cuites à point, tendres et assaisonnées subtilement. Le tout accompagné d'un Bordeaux suggéré par le serveur qui se mariait très bien avec nos choix de plats.... Restaurant très bien situé, dans le complexe de la Place des Arts."}
