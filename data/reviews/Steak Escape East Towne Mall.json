{"text":"Great spot to satisfy your craving for a Philly cheesesteak sandwich.  Also I loved the house made French fries and scratch lemonade.  Keep up the good work guys !"}
{"text":"It was was marginal. I got a steak burger and it was dried out and was more like jerky. Baked potato was alright though"}
