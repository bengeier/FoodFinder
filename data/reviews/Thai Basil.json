{"text":"I've only been here twice, but they impressed me the last time we went. A friend and I were craving some Thai food a few nights ago and showed up at Thai Basil 20 minutes before they closed. I thought they handled us pretty well as the waitress was making jokes with us instead of rushing us through our meal. The food was also still spectacular and came out very quickly. The Red Curry is a must-try!"}
{"text":"We've never had anything but a hot, delicious meal from Thai Basil. Whenever we've ordered for either takeout or delivery, the food is ready very quickly (or if it won't be, they tell us ahead of time). The food is fresh and flavorful, and they are great about accommodating dietary requests."}
{"text":"Nice environment , nice decor and diner set. Nice place for romantic date. Third time visiting this place and I noticed Waitress don't seem to smile at all maybe it's just me. Prices are reasonable. I got to try red, green and yellow curries. Majority of dishes are made with coconut flavours. I love their red chilli fried rice which why I visit this place."}
{"text":"Best Thai food in the valley and consistent from one restaurant to another!

The Thai basil house special sauté is one of my favorites. The red green and yellow curries are marvelous too. 

Always super fresh ingredients. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Decent ambiance, terrible food, good service.  

I ordered 'larb' chicken wrapped in lettuce, beef green curry, and deep friend veg spring rolls.  The larb was awful, tasted like it had been microwaved/accumulated other smells from the freezer where I'm sure the meat came from.  Beef curry was okay, nothing special.  Also had a sickly green colour which I've never seen before and the spring rolls were prev. frozen run of the mill.  Nothing special there.

The staff were very accommodating at taking away the larb and not making us pay for it and even offered a weird corn/tapioca dessert pudding thing after we were done.  I had one spoonful and didn't want more.

This place needs to make their enormous menu smaller and work on their recipes.  Until that day I will be getting my Thai food fix from elsewhere."}
{"text":"I have been here several times and have always had good service nd good food. I really like the green curry. They do an excellent job of keeping the place clean."}
{"text":"First to start. The food here is quite good. Portions arent huge but fair. The flavours are quite delicious. I dont think that I have ordered a dish that I was disappointed with so far. The only down side is that their service is consistently slow. The servers are nice and polite but I think that their kitchen may be understaffed. Each time I go, it takes quite some time before the dishes arrive. Otherwise a nice place with good decor and fair price."}
{"text":"I love their Red Curry.  I could eat it all in one sitting because it tastes so good.  But I usually try to only eat half while I am there and take the other half home so I can enjoy it twice."}
{"text":"In town, on a layover flight to Cabo San Lucas.  We showed up here by a recommendation from the host at the hotel.  It was fantastic.  My wife, who previous to this restaurant, said \"I do not like Thai food.\" Is now a fan. She loved the eggplant entrée.  Our 3 yr old liked the BBQ chicken type dish and our 5 yr old loved the curry.  The waitress was great.  She held our 9 month old baby and walked around showing him off to the rest of the staff, which may be too much for some, but it allowed mom to get a few bites in without him on her lap.  They do have high chairs, but he decided mom's lap was the place for him.  We would definitely do by again, if we were in the area."}
{"text":"Pad thai was horrible and overcooked . the cashew chicken wasnt good the chicken was completely bland and tasted like it was on the verge of going bad so I did not eat it. I will stick to vegetarian next time"}
{"text":"Have been to Thai Basil several times and have never been disappointed! I found the prices to be reasonable (they often have two can dine type specials). Highly recommend Cashew Chicken and Mango Chicken. The lychee mint tea is also delicious. Sometimes the service can be a little slow but overall I have never had a bad experience."}
{"text":"Man the thai basil chicken is so damn good here!  also the papaya salad is to die for!  try the thai iced tea also while you are here and you wont be upset!  well worth the drive!"}
{"text":"Good food, efficient  and friendly service,  decent prices.We ordered the green curry and seafood pancake and they both lived up to our expectations. The portions are plentiful also.Would love to come back!"}
{"text":"I have tried almost all dishes there, and those taste great! Really recommend if you like spicy food, but you can choose no spicy flavor though."}
{"text":"The food here is excellent.  I have previously worked for this place, and seen what goes on behind the scenes, and know how fresh they keep their ingredients as well as the skill care and attentive nature they pour into every dish.  It is as authentic as you can likely get without heading yourself over to Thailand itself.  They can kick the heat up on *any* dish you order as hot as you can handle, and iIve had a good number of their dishes, not a single one i was disappointed with, my personal favorite is their Pad Woon Sen with chicken, kicked as high up on their spicy as they will go.
The only minor downside is they do not yet have a dine-in option, but considering they are specifically carry-out, hard to fault them for a service they don't advertise.
Would definitely recommend to anyone who enjoys this type of food, spicy or no."}
{"text":"This is by far the best Thai food around! Just had it for my first time yesterday. I'm so hooked. I ordered spicey beef noodle and had them add mint. Yummm"}
{"text":"Just tried this place had them deliver to the office I work at. The food was great, would def order again. Delivery was quick."}
{"text":"Gag!  Worst Thai ever.  I wanted Pad Si Ew but they didn't have it, so I got Drunken Noodles.  Gross!  I got it to go and as soon as I got home and opened the container, I was overwhelmed by the stench of the funky food.  Figured it was just the smell that was bad, so forced myself to eat some.  Blah!  The sauce was totally greasy and yucky.  I felt sick afterwards.

I was weirded out when I got there and noticed that in addition to Thai food they also serve sushi.  Hmm... weird mix.  I will not be trying the sushi that's for sure, or ever returning."}
{"text":"mmmm mmmm delicous!! This is by far one of my favorite \"different\" places. Im not known much for trying new things when it comes to food, but here I feel like I can branch out a little! My friends and I were recommended to this place a couple years ago, and now we take everyone we meet there! My husband and I went the other night, he got the special which was the Thai Basil with lamb, and I went with my always favorite spicey noodles with chicken! The Thai Basil was full of flavor it made mine taste whimpy in comparison, but I will always love the spicey noodles! The waiters and friendly and try to get you a seat as soon as they can even when its packed on a friday night! 5 stars from me!!"}
{"text":"Note that this place has changed names since the review. No longer appears to have even a small eat-in area. http://www.thaibasilcarryout.com/

My rating is a placeholder as we only drove past when we saw that there was no dine-in option."}
{"text":"Consistently great; I especially love their coconut soup, but the curry is also excellent. This is at least one of the better Thai restaurants in the southwest."}
{"text":"Tried the chicken pad thai spicy, it tasted amazing. Very big portions as well. 

Place seems authentic and very appealing to dine in, 

Will try lunch specials next time !"}
{"text":"Very disappointed. Tum yum shrimp soup tasty but noodles so overcooked it was unedible. Service was terrible. I have to say they were not rude but clearly they were not happy to be working on valentine's day and made you very aware of that. Staff all looked very unhappy and made me feel like I was a bother. Terrible heating system. Blows warm to cold air from the ceiling directly on your neck and shoulders. Very uncomfortable on a cold night!"}
{"text":"We decided to try this place and ordered soup. Thinking soup would be regular size cups we ordered 2 and then ordered 2 more dishes. Soup bowls were massive, a meal in itself. Waitress didn't help us in pointing that it is too much food for a family with 2 kids. Otherwise food was decent."}
{"text":"Excellent Thai food.  I have had the Thai Basil and Green Curry.  I like the low lighting atmosphere.  Some asian music usually plays in the background.  Another reviewer mentioned long wait for food, but I've never had that experience."}
{"text":"This is the new Thai Basil location at Park Central Mall.  I am happy to report it is much like its Tempe location in food quality.  I had the Thai Basil and it was just as delicious as the Tempe location.  I went during the lunch rush and had no problems, only prompt service and very yummy Thai food.  The mood of the restaurant is also quite similar to the Tempe spot--with the addition of outdoor seating.  This yelper recommends it!"}
{"text":"Best Tom Yum Soup in town!

I love the small, quaint interior of this place.  It has this intimate ambience that you won't get at larger restaurants - and because of it has much fewer seating, the wait time is much longer.  BUT the food is worth the wait.  

I love the Tom Yum Soup but I personally find the Pad Thai very bitter.  

However, I can't wait to go back again and do recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Excellent food, great value and the Iced Ginger Lemongrass cold tea was great!
Love the atmosphere, clean and inviting!"}
{"text":"For lunch, arrive by 11:30, or expect to wait for a seat. Service is a bit slow (understandably, given how busy they are), but it's fine as long as you aren't in a hurry. The Garlic Chicken and Spicy Noodles dishes are my favorites. Since the chicken pieces are over-large for the dishes, I usually order the tofu. I've visited for lunch several times and have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"Excellent food, nice atmosphere, clean, with great service. I had #30 Cashew with vegetables and steamed rice. Mild, still had some spice. Husband had Drunken noodles, medium spice which he described as \"plenty\". Everything was fresh. The shrimp with my dish was cooked slightly long.  All in all very tasty! Portion sizes were generous without being too large."}
{"text":"I have eating at Thai Basil since it first opened and go at least twice a month.  I have never had a bad meal and have taken many friends and out of town guests.  My favorite is the kung pao chicken with cashews and the chicken panang.  I travel fairly often to Thailand and Malaysia, and I still find Thai Basil's food to be very representive.  The staff is very willing to please and will be happy to explain how the dishes are prepared."}
{"text":"Actually been here a few times... the service is hit and miss but the food, especially the curry, is really good.  The Penang Curry is the dish I would most recommend, although it isn't always consistently great, just always good.  Consistency is a big issue for this place, actually... they have plenty of staff, but its a little cramped and the seating can get frustrating.  They might try to seat you in odd places, too.  If you go as a couple, insist on a booth, and you'll be fine.  The pad thai seems well prepared in advance but was quite tasty.  The drinks are well made, and the bartenders know their stuff.  Overall a great place to score some decent thai food in Thornhill!

I went again and bumped them up for their dessert, which was really good, and better service as the year progressed..."}
{"text":"Their signature dish is Thai Basil. Their Thai Basil was disappointing. Hardly any flavor. Their rice was way overcooked and when we dug down to the bottom of our bowls, it was burned. The vegetables were undercooked. 

However, I did get their red curry to go and that was very good."}
{"text":"The food here is excellent - this is one of my go to restaurants for an inexpensive meal or takeout. The food is very fresh and flavorful. The service is quick and the servers are very friendly.

5 stars for food 
5 stars for service
3 stars for ambience"}
{"text":"Great green curry pace see ew and fried rice
Everyone loved fried banana dessert
Olive fried rice
Egg plant
Yum"}
{"text":"This is currently my favorite restaurant in the Scottsdale/Tempe area.  I really have not been able to stay away since going there for my first time in December.  Their coconut soup with tofu is amazing --- sweet with bit of a lasting bite.  Tofu can be subbed into all of their dishes, so it is an excellent vegetarian restaurants.  Their curries are particularly good.  I've had a number of dishes there and I have never been disappointed.  

They ask you how spicy you would like your meal.  The spiciest option has a nice flavor and a bit of a burn, but it is not overwhelming.  Lunch specials costing around $8 come with a spring roll and soup.  Dinner is slightly more expensive."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE it here! I'm so glad I stumbled across this restaurant as I was heading to one of the stores in the same plaza.

The place is clean and the food is full of flavour. The prices are really good too, especially for their large portion sizes. The presentation of their dishes are creative- especially the pineapple rice which is served in a hollowed out pineapple.  

I introduced this place to both my parents and boyfriend, and we order from here all the time! 

The only thing is, if you are planning to dine in, it gets get busy (which I guess is a good sign). When it's like that, the service is quite slow. Other than that, I would definitely pay this restaurant a visit- a must-try!!"}
{"text":"Ate here a couple of weeks ago around noon on a Saturday.  Upon entering the place, we were pleasantly surprised by the cute atmosphere.  The waitresses there are pretty friendly and served with a smile.  Our party of three ordered from their lunch specials:

* Spicy noodles with pork 

* Spicy Thai basil with ground chicken

* Eggplant with tofu

The portions were huge, considering that it was lunchtime.  We ate family style, so I was able to taste all three.  We requested all three dishes made spicy, and in terms of the level of spice, I rate them as medium-spicy.  

The spicy pork noodles were flavorful and moist, the Thai basil chicken was good (not great), and the eggplant and tofu dish was kind of flavorless.  The cook could have left out the broccoli and bamboo, and added a bit more ground chicken and basil to the Thai basil dish, and it would have appealed to me more.

We ordered two Thai iced teas and one Thai iced coffee.  The drinks came in long, tall glasses...well worth the price for each drink.  The Thai iced tea was good, but the iced coffee was too sweet and had a weird aftertaste. Oh yeah, they serve this cabbage and tofu soup (flavorful) as a pre-courser to your entrees.    

Overall, the food was good for a quick lunch, but nothing to write home about.  The price for each dish was around $7-$8."}
{"text":"Had my pre hockey meal here.  Got spicy noodle with extra beef.  It was amazing!! So flavorful and delicious.   Lots of food.  Probably ate more than I should have but it was soo good.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"My GF and I came in here today around 430 to get some food before hockey.  I ordered spicy noodles and beef and she got red curry.  Food was amazing, flavorful and came out fast!"}
{"text":"Nice find off the beaten path of Mill St. Food was really fresh. Pad thai yummy. Beef salad and spring rolls to start were fresh and hot. Each dish was really good. Would have loved a beer or wine ;-)"}
{"text":"I went to the Richmond Hill location. The place was packed so I opted for take out. I ordered the lunch special, an entree, spring roll and soup, all coming in around $10 with taxes. The spring roll was the highlight to my meal, the Tom Yum soup was waaaay too salty for my liking, and the mango chicken with cashews was alright. I would do the lunch special again, since it's alot of food for ten dollars, but I doubt I would go in for dinner."}
{"text":"I ordered delivery through grub hub. I made many modifications to my order and everything was correct. So tasty!"}
{"text":"My experience is based solely on the lunch special. I'm beginning to see that just because it's 'special', doesn't mean that $7.95 necessarily buys you a satisfying meal.

Your lunch special of choice comes with:
- vegetarian spring rolls (quite possibly the best part, and fried to a magnificent deep brown)
- hot & sour soup (meager little bowl, but nice and sour)
- green salad (ice berg lettuce drizzled with a big of dressing)
- rice (but not if you have noodles...no rice for you)

I had the pad thai with chicken. I didn't finish the whole plate (it was a generous portion), but I ended up chucking the styrofoam package right into the bin. My stomach felt twisted up after eating it... don't know if it was just a bad day, or a case of so-so noodles.

For dinner, I would try Thai Basil again, because I don't think restaurants should only be judged for their pull-customers-in lunch specials.

One thing that did bug me was that a worker was cleaning all the glass near us while we were eating... mmm, chemicals."}
{"text":"The best Thai food in Madison. The ingredients are fresh. Things are cooked to perfection and the dishes are amazingly flavorful."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Very affordable during happy hour and they give great portions. I always get the Pad Thai, but their curries and seafood pancakes are also great. My only negative is that the tofu in their pad thai is not that great tasting. I also wish they made it spicier. I ask for thai hot and for extra chile sauce and it still isn't that hot for me."}
{"text":"I love thai basil. esepcially this location. 
Great for lunch, service is great, its always packed so maybe avoid the lunch rush?

Lunch special comes w. soup, spring roll, fruit desert and the meal.
Great price and food is always fresh. 
Also their purple rice and mango desert is awesome!"}
{"text":"It was my first try at Thai food in United States and I was impressed. The dishes were tasty and service was good too. 
The only problem was the server messed up one of my dishes and refused to take it back. 
Other than that the experience was quite pleasant."}
{"text":"Nice decorations!  Full of wooden Thai Buddies!  Environment is nice and lighting are great.

Must try the Young cocount Seafood fried rice, Marsaman curry beef briskets!!  Green curry are nice also.

The Tung yum kong soup are also very outstanding!"}
{"text":"I've eaten at Thai Basil a countless number of times because it's absolutely delicious. I am a huge fan of the tofu and veggie red curry with rice and the tofu cashew nut with rice. It's out of control amazing. I usually do delivery and they have been at my place in 15 mins after the order was put in. The staff are a pleasure."}
{"text":"Excelllent thai food. I have been to a couple of thai restaraunts in Tempe. None of them compare to Thai Basil. The staff was friendly. The food was excellent. I am normally a noodle guy and usually substitute rice for noodles but not there. Their rice is fantastic. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"When staying in Phoenix for a business trip, my co-worker and I felt like some Thai food after a long day of work. Searched Yelp and found this gem. This place is the best! Large portions, spicy, and great prices! I recommend Thai Basil to anyone looking for excellent Thai food in the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"This is a terrible place for real Thai food. My coworker and I ordered from here for lunch, the prices weren't the best, but with the reviews it had gotten we figured we would try it anyways.
We ordered the Pad Thai. First Mistake- 
The Tofu was the only thing that had any type of flavor, (which isn't saying much since tofu usually doesn't have flavor)  the noodles were dry and had no flavoring. There were egg patties that were watery and over cooked, overall it was awful. Like the other reviews on this page, we are avid Thai eaters. This place may have had its glory days, but its far from them now. I will not recommend this place to anyone, nor will we be returning. I agree with the other Thai lovers, in saying this place is not authentic, has no flavor, and agree with them when they say they have eaten in a number of very good Thai restaurants over the valley and this is not one of them, we also will not be returning here.
I hope this review helps others who are craving Thai, go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Open on Sunday! Lot if places aren't, around here. I ordered the fresh roll appetizer with chicken. It arrived quickly. They were large, with lots of vegetables, as I like it. Didn't detect any cilantro or basil in them, which I tend to enjoy, but these were still satisfying: fresh, crispy, julianned vegetables with a bit of chicken. The fish sauce and peanut sauce were ok. Good, but a little one dimensionally sweet - probably for American tastes. 

Next up, I had the Thai basil. I requested Thai hot. It came quick on the heels of my fresh rolls and was spicy but not searingly so. Vegetables were vibrantly colored (read: not over-cooked) and abundant, accompanied with a fair amount of chicken. Wasn't as much basil as I would have hoped. Overall it was a nice dish, however.

Service was friendly and prompt. Decor clean."}
{"text":"I saw Thai Basil as I walked down to the subway stop and have been bugging my co-worker to go for lunch. We decided to go one day. Although the website said that they open at 11:30, a sign on the door said they would be opening at noon. That's fine...we just walked around a bookshop beside the place. 

However, we went back around noon, and saw that the restaurant owners were having a meeting. There was another couple waiting there, and they didn't even come out to tell us what was going on? I thought that was very poor service on their part. They lost our business that day. 

We went back another day, and they were open on time. I got a lunch special: Cashew Tofu and rice. It was not anything special...slightly watery and not very flavourful. I wasn't a fan of the soup...and the spring roll was pretty basic. 

All together it was OK food."}
{"text":"I was first introduced to Thai Basil on a date (the location on University). I don't know if it was the food or the company but I had a fantastic time and have been with that very same boy for over 2 years now :-) Good first date choice, Sean R! We probably get take out/dine in at Thai Basil once every week or two. When the new location (within walking distance of home) opened up on Rural I was ecstatic. The owners/waitstaff are always warm, friendly, and inviting. The restaurant is cozy, dark and intimate and the food is amazing with killer prices. I can't begin to describe how much I love Thai food. My favorite dishes are the Thai Basil with chicken or shrimp, Garlic chicken or shrimp, the Red Curry chicken, and the Coconut soup (soooo good!). The spring rolls are amazing as well. I have never had a bad experience...in fact, I think I'll get takeout from Thai Basil this evening, it just sounds so good writing about it!"}
{"text":"Awesome!!  Still here and was inspired to write a review... Had an absolutely delicious dinner.  The BF had a curry fried rice that he loved and I had a tofu cashew pineapple Thai stirfry on brown rice that was absolutely awesome - I requested my vegetables cooked crunchy they were perfect.  Always love sake bombers - love that they have gluten-free Japanese beer served in chilled mugs - bonus!  Only thing we are sad about was at the coconut ice cream has cows milk in it - bummer :-( it's homemade but maybe they'll be inspired to make it with just coconut milk next time .  Our server, Nitiya was lovely, so helpful and friendly - really added to our experience, made it even that much better - ask for her!

Thanks Thai Basil - we'll be back !!"}
{"text":"In town for a week been here 3 times! Food is very addiction tasty!  I order combo fried rice, ragoon and curry noodles.  Place is a dump (carry out place),  location is hard to find around high traffic road.  but all I care about is the good tasting food."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this Thai place in Tempe. My favorite lunch spot whenever I can unchain myself from the desk!"}
{"text":"Let's keep this review simple.. This place is on point. I've tried all their curries!!! So yummy. I love any of their peanut sauces and they are so cravable. Ps I love to pick out a good this place if they have a solid Thai tea.. And they do!"}
{"text":"Ordered in from here and was disappointed on all fronts. It arrived barely warm. The pad Thai is not even average. I ordered the pad see ew with chicken and tiger prawn. I received chicken and cocktail shrimp. When I called to complain, they spent the majority of the time convincing me that the order was accurate. After much debate, thy contacted a manager who approved a refund for the amount of the dish. Overall, a terrible experience."}
{"text":"Went there for dinner tonight. The food is pretty good.

I LOVE the Thai BBQ pork! It's tender pork grilled in Thai style, served with pickled vegetables and homemade spicy BBQ sauce.
I LOVE it! The pork is so tender!!! It is super super delicious with the homemade spicy BBQ sauce.

I also tried the Pad Thai and Pad Woon Sen. They were okay, strong tomato sauce. I don't think authentic tho..

I also tried the Thai cold roll for starter. It is rice paper wrapping vermicelli, shredded carrots, cucumbers, green onions, basil and mint leaves. It has a really strong taste of mint leaves. I personally didn't really like the cold roll because of the strong taste of mint leaves...But if you are a fan of mint leaves, you probably will like this."}
{"text":"I would have to completely disagree with the other reviewer in regards to the panang.  I absolutely love it!  My husband and I get take out from there at least every two weeks.  He has tried every noodle dish on the menu, but keeps coming back to the Chicken Pad Thai.  I find the vegetable panang to be very authentic, and sometimes it is spicier than other times - but I always love it.  I agree that the decor is an interesting mix and that the restaurant is more Asian blend that straight Thai - but for it's convenient location and decent prices, as well as fantastic panang, we return time after time."}
{"text":"Yummy !!!! The food here is delicious, fresh and portions are generous. A wonderful place for both lunch and dinner. Service is very quick and attentive. One of very few restaurants that will actually prepare your food to the level of spiciness you desire -- and I love my food very spicy -- double to triple Thai hot. The restaurant is consistently busy due to it's proximity to ASU, but always clean."}
{"text":"Holy mackeral.  They yellow curry is DELICIOUS!!!!!  My favorite place to go to get great Thai food that i can actually afford!  You can request the degree of spiciness as well, which I love.  Portions are huge too!  So go hungry!  They also do take out which is awesome when i want to just run in."}
{"text":"I got there at 9:20pm.Very friendly service, nice relaxed atmosphere.  three choices of table settings: the booth, the square tables and the high tables with high chairs. I went for the high table. intimate lighting, soft music. now for the food, I chose the Rama with peanut sauce and chicken. I like my food very spicy so I ordered it \"double Thai hot\". And hot is was! :-)  it caused a good sweat and a running nose, lol, but that's how I like it. The wonderful different flavors of the food still came through very nicely and I enjoyed it a lot. Fried banana with ice cream to top it off (YUM, I feel like i'm in Thailand) and it was a great late night's dinner. I recommend it highly for a relaxed date."}
{"text":"My wife and I love this place.  Even our little toddler loves the bbq chicken.  The service is always really good, even though they are very busy at lunch, the help works their butts off.  Try the Duck Curry, this is my favorite dish!"}
{"text":"I was hesitant to try after reading some of the reviews about this place.  After getting a feel for what folks liked and didn't I decided to give it a shot and was pleasantly surprised.  The restaurant is beautiful and the staff pleasant. The food was what I expected it to be and i will be back.

Note, I did NOT expect it to be Mom and Pop authentic Thai.  Why?  Because it is not a Thai Restaurant!  it is an Asian restaurant that serves Vietnamese, Japanese, Chinese and Thai (I'm sure i missed something there).  So, as I expected, the food was somewhat \"middle of the road\" between all of those.  Not strong curry or strong spice...  But it was perfect for a small group who couldn't decide which type of restaurant to go for lunch.

The Bento boxes are HUGE and filling (I had leftovers). 

If you want authentic Thai (or chinese or Japanese) Go to a Thai place. not an \"Asian Fare\" restaurant.

For what this place does, it does it very well and we will go back!"}
{"text":"In Tempe looking for decent restaurant for dinner. Marriott Courtyard had list of nearby places. Yelped a few and thought I would give it a try. Would definitely come back next time in town. Had clear broth soup w veggies and shrimp - small bowl...enough for a meal. Also had Pai Thai..very good. Server extremely pleasant..strongly suggest you give it a try. Marc"}
{"text":"The Yelp description for 3 stars fits this place pretty well...it's A-OK. It's not the best Thai in the Valley, and certainly not worth driving out of your way for, but if you feel like Thai and you're in Tempe, it's good. A word of warning: no alcohol is served...so if you're craving a Thai beer, this isn't the place for you. The combo appetizer is very good, as is the panang. The pad thai is just okay. Service is friendly, but a little slow on refilling drinks, to the point where you need to walk up to the counter to ask for more water."}
{"text":"My Valentine's date brought me here last year. If not for him, I probably would have never heard of this place. Though I love curry, there are few places that have as good of curry as Thai Basil. Plus, their Thai Iced Tea is so good. SO GOOD.

I usually like to dine there whenever I'm in the area. :)"}
{"text":"pretty good overall, there's good deal on lunch combo."}
{"text":"We just moved here and were searching yelp for a new Thai spot. The high reviews this establishment received made us feel confident in our decision to order take out. We were so disappointed! The curry was ok. The Basil chicken, their \"signature\", was so dry we didn't eat it. The pad see ew, which is usually one of our favorites was the best thing we ordered, although even that was lacking a great deal of flavor. We won't return and honestly, we may not trust yelpers as much as we had before. My question is, does Phoenix simply not have very good Thai food and so everyone thinks that this lackluster spot is delicious??"}
{"text":"i eat here often and i love it.  It's one of my favorite restaurants in mesa. when ever i have friends in town i take them here.  the food is so tasty and the everyone that works there is friendly and happy.  5 stars for sure."}
{"text":"I really like that this place is close to home and their service is awesome. I just wish their pho wasn't so bland. Their bento box is pretty good though. I was originally brought in because they sell sushi& pho all in one place. It has a quiet relaxed atmosphere nothing too fancy."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in the Drunken noodles. Far too oily and lacking in flavor. I asked for it to be spicy and they did a good job of giving it heat: the problem was the lack of taste associated with the heat. There just wasn't any balance in the dish. 

Prices weren't cheap but not super expensive-- $9.50 for a pretty solid portion of noodles. 

Friendly guy running the counter, and it took less than ten minutes from ordering for them to have my food ready. 

Ultimately I think the restaurant has to be judged on taste, and unfortunately my dish lacked in that regard."}
{"text":"I love Thai Basil and have eaten at a few of their locations.  I have always had my food to go from this location and never had any issues.  You get a huge portion of food that is still hot when you get home and the spring rolls are still have some crunch, not just soggy!  My favorite dish has always been the Chowmein with chicken.  My fiancé loves their Yellow Curry."}
{"text":"This is as good as Thai food gets.  I haven't been to the other Thai Basil locations because the wife and I are just a hop, skip, and a jump away from this one. If we ever eat at other Thai restaurants she gets the pad thai thinking she'll get what Thai Basil gives her.  She is always disappointed.  There is no other pad thai outside of Thailand this good.  For me, I'm a massaman guy.  So good, it will make your head tingle!"}
{"text":"Can't believe how great this place is. Ordered late Saturday night and they delivered in 15 minutes! I was sure I had misunderstood and it was going to be 50 minutes but they were prompt and the food was great. I got the chicken pad Thai and my friend got the yellow curry and we were both pleased. I even enjoyed the remainder of mine reheated the next day and it was still good.  I'd highly recommend to anyone!"}
{"text":"The Spicy Noodles and Pad Thai were excellent! The portions were a good size too and I got two full meals out of it. I wish they served alcohol but at least now I have a great local thai place that looks super easy to pick up from."}
{"text":"Overpriced, bland, and crap. The Pad Thai is dry and flavorless. It is basically over cooked plain noodles with rubbery chicken."}
{"text":"Service is great, food is great and speedy! Always have good experiences here. Prices are good as well, especially the lunch specials. The staff is very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Excellent Thai Food, good atmosphere, family friendly, service was good and quick. We (2 adults and 1 kid) had pad spring cold rolls as an appetizer. Thai, seafood and fried noodles. Total was $60 tip and tax included."}
{"text":"I had seen this little restaurant on my way to work a million times but it was only one of the many I saw everyday and I never paid \"real\" attention to it. Once my hubby and I decided to check it out we were absolutely hooked, that was last Saturday, it has been only one week and we had been there three times already, I think that means a lot of love right? I really hope it never breaks our heart. 

I have a deep fascination for curries, they are so comforting to the soul, for me, it's an exotic mix of aromatic herbs that makes you fall into a trance whenever you are eating them, in a good way though :)

So far, we have been hypnotized by the pineapple curry (with shrimp), I think the mild seafood flavor it's what makes it great. 
Also, The Panang Curry, which I think it has the base as the pineapple one (only without the pineapple and tomatoes). They both come with red and green bell peppers, carrots and Thai basil leaves, they are very good and sooo aromatic, mmmmmmm.
 The Green curry it's also good and very different from the other curries because it combines herbs with a beautiful roasted Thai eggplant flavor. 

Also, you have to have their Crab Rangoons! Golden brown and crunchyy with a nice cream cheese filling; Acompannied by a glossy honey sauce with a few red pepper flakes on it, perrrfect. 

You have to try this place by yourself and maybe, just maybe think of me a little bit whenever your senses feel spoiled ;)"}
{"text":"Worst restaurant ever! Service was bad! Try asking for a refill on your water...you will be waiting forever! Don't order the fried rice...it's pretty bad. Beware...entrees don't come with rice...it is an extra $1.50 for a small bowl. Eat somewhere else...any where, but here..."}
{"text":"Thai Basil, its one of the best places to order out some food.  Its also one of the best places to dine in.  I only speak the truth, the service is great, the food is pretty darn good for Arizona Thai food.

The people there are always happy to see you and are supper nice.  When I order Thai food I always judge the place on there pad thai and theirs is so good.  I like to get mine medium spice because I am not one for drinking water ever 5 seconds.

The yellow coconut curry is just as good as well.  They also have specials when you go in that you can look for on the white wash bored.   

Recommendation: Go for the food, and then stay for food.  I have yet to try other thai restaurants around town.  But so far so good."}
{"text":"My favourite Thai Resturant in Toronto.  

Make sure you order their Larb!  Good spicy kick!  We've tried all their curry and it is our fav!!!"}
{"text":"This place would get 0 stars if it wasnt for the good food, but the sushi chef is not very nice at all. We would frequent this place 2x/week minimum for a couple months. We would order the same things every time, it was a LITTLE different then what the menu stated i.e. we would get the singapore noodle and make it a combination and no bell peppers....not that big of a deal right?

Well one day we ordered the usual, and the sushi chef just SNAPPED. Started yelling at us and it was just insane, i know it sounds like its a story, but its a TRUE story. Amazing....i used to take care of the chef so well $$$ wise, and for him to call us out saying we are a pain in the rear and how we disrespect the menu by adding and changing our own things, it was just ludicrous. 

I really like the who's your daddy roll though and singapore, and the sweet n sour chicken....but its not worth going there having to deal with the DK whad behind the counter."}
{"text":"Best Thai food I have ever had! And I love Thai! Staff is friendly and quick. Love that I can order for takeout."}
{"text":"LOVE the Thai Basil w Tofu. Their tofu is so good! I'm very picky about my tofu and Thai Basil gets it right. I've gotten one of the curries once and it was good, but I love the fresh and light Thai Basil dish. We order takeout from here quite often and they're always friendly, fast and never screw up the order! The prices are great too!"}
{"text":"I had been to Thai Basil a handful of times a couple years ago and then all of a sudden stopped going.  I couldn't remember why this happened and decided to pay a visit the other night.  Well, as Celine once sang: \"It's all coming back to me now...\"

Let me start by saying the name of the place is THAI Basil, yet on the front of their restaurant they also advertise pho, sushi, and Corona.  Maybe they are trying to cater to the North Las Vegas crowd who has a serious lack of Asian (and beer?) choices, but I'm always leery of a restaurant that is mainly one type of food but throws in some other options as well.

In order of best tasting, we had: Thai Basil Vegetables, Panang Curry with tofu, and Pad Thai with tofu.

Thai Basil Vegetables: I have to give them some major props for fresh, well-cooked veggies.  It had tons of broccoli and baby bok choy and very little carrots (bleh).  My body was happy for the nutrients.  However, the praises end there as the sauce was thick and goopy and a little too sweet.  Despite being the most flavorful thing we ordered, it could have used some more love.

Panang Curry: I was excited to see a giant container of curry when we got home thinking we had hit the jackpot.  But then I became sad once I started to dig around and realized that it was mainly curry broth and very little \"meat\" to it.  It contained mostly tofu (I was hoping for veggies) and the tofu was cut into huge pieces.  I hate this because the tofu ends up not soaking up as much curry as it can if the pieces were cut smaller.  As for veggies, there were only a couple pieces of tomato and green pepper.  There was also a good bit of onion- which I would normally enjoy- but the onion was completely raw.  Sorry, I can't handle that much raw onion breath, thanks.  On top of it, the curry was pretty bland with only a tiny bit of spice.

Pad Thai: I know that this is typically the white people's noodles in Thai restaurants.  I normally don't order Pad Thai, but when I asked the lady which noodles she recommended, she was enthusiastic about them (perhaps she was playing it safe with me?).  Anyway, the noodles were super thin, super dry, super greasy, and super flavorless.  There were hardly any bean sprouts and there was zero spice.  Granted, they gave me some chili paste on the side, but I prefer my noodles to be spiced-up on arrival.  

In all, if you are the kind of person that can't drive out of your way to go get some good Thai food, then this place will do if you live in the area.  Otherwise, save up a couple bucks for gas and get your butt out to Komol."}
{"text":"Great place, easy access for folks on the Tempe campus of ASU, and a killer menu for anyone who likes Thai.  My favorite is the eggplant dish, but everything is really good here.  Not as oily as some of the other Thai places in Tempe (i.e. Thai Rama, although I like Thai Rama, too)."}
{"text":"I was craving yellow curry since I came back from a vac-kay in Hawaii.  The only thing I ordered here was the chicken yellow curry. I thought it was a little on the sweet side with no spice at all. The guy who took my order didnt ask for a spice level, but I assumed there would be a hint of it. I was wrong! It was ok. Lunch seemed a little expensive to me. I also ordered a Thai iced tea. It was like tea and cream on ice. I thought that was way too sweet also. Overall the food was tasty, but just missing the kick of spice. The restaurant is small and quaint, but traditionally decorated."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great Curry & the coconut soup is the best!"}
{"text":"Excellent service! Me and my mom went there yesterday. I got the Pad Sea Ew and my mom got the Pad Thai. My mom unfortunately didn't know that there was going to be tofu in her Pad Thai and wasn't a huge fan. The staff was super understanding and offered my mom something else at no charge since she didn't like it. She ended up getting the same thing that I got and really enjoyed."}
{"text":"Two stars based only on the three items I ordered during my first visit, to go.

White rice: once out of the box, it dries really fast. I'll likely turn this into fried rice with leftovers.

Papaya salad: I requested medium spice. They gave chili sauce in a cup. That's just weird to eat papaya salad with this kind of chili sauce. They should've used thai chili peppers. The salad itself was edible but not great. Would I order again? Likely not.

Drunken noodles: I ordered this as is. It lacks flavor. A lot of it. I'm guessing that's the reason for the 10 packets of soy sauce I received. The only thing I like is the beef. That was tasty. Would I order this again? Probably not.

I don't think I'd come back to this place based on that and knowing there are restaurants closer to authentic. Now I'm not saying this to be rude or anything, but this style is more catered to people that are not familiar with any type of spice and flavorful thai. Some people say it's white people style lol again, not in a mean way. That's just how we describe it when we explain how the food is."}
{"text":"Chicken curry was great and service was awesome. There was only 1 waiter but he did his best helping everyone. Will definitely be back"}
{"text":"They have really great Thai food. There prices are also great! I love there lunch specials! 

Every time I go the staff is so friendly and I am seated quickly!"}
{"text":"I love how Christine makes every thing on the menu.. I've been eating there since they opened probably 14 years ago....I have eaten at other Thai places but nothing compares to Thai basil my very favorite. The pad thai is divine the flavor delicious. The Thai spring rolls are my very favorite I usually get them every time I go... The spicy peanut sauce rocks my world. I love their pickled cucumber salad very delicious. Eat there you will see what I mean. I also love the fact that every day they eat together as a staff and a family."}
{"text":"Decent thai food for a reasonable price.  I had the drunken noodles and the evil jungle noodles (both with tofu).  I was a little disappointed in the drunken noodles because they had a \"burnt wok\" taste to them.  The evil jungle noodles were good but could have been a bit more spicey.  The tofu had the taste of being dipped in the deep fryer.  The portions were large and the food was piping hot when delivered.  A good choice for thai delivery, but I would go elsewhere if I were drivng."}
{"text":"Generally a very plain dinner, it's not the worst, but if I had choice I wouldn't go back there.
Coconut tea: a bit like coconut flavored milk tea.
Mango salad: average, it's everywhere. My friend said their grilled beef mango salad was awesome but they crossed it off from the menu now.
Tom-Yum: I'm not an expert but I love tom-yum, this was not so bad, at least it got all the spice in it, but it's a bit too sour.
Green Curry chicken: not bad, if I went back I will order it again.
Pineapple fried rice: hmm definitely had many better ones, no much flavor. I'm telling you, if you need to mix your pineapple with green curry to enjoy it something has went wrong.
In one word, I'm ready to try other thai places."}
{"text":"The calamari appetizer was probably best calamari I have had anywhere not close to the ocean. Green curry chicken is excellent dish as well. Flavorful and colorful."}
{"text":"If you're up for some authentic Thai food, you're in the right place. The food there is so spicy, but not in a way where you can't taste anything.

We ordered the dinner for two, with Thai basil chilli noodles (with minced pork) and pomelo salad, which turned out to be more than enough for four people. Definitely try their numerous salad options, don't just stick with Pad Sew!"}
{"text":"Okay, so I just moved here two months ago from the Bay Area where we have a big Thai population thus resulting in a large Thai food restaurant population. Anyways, I'm a big fan of the stuff and figured here in burrito land there would be nothing decent from Asia. Wrong.
After reading some reviews I gave it a shot and was more than satisfied. Good food, good portions.... sums up the food. The service was marginal with my requesting for water and all, but the guy was nice and gave us some free rice upon my price inquiry. 
I will most certainly be returning, hopefully to more hospitable service, and hope to soon refer to this as \"the place I always go\". I definitely advise Thai Basil to anyone in question."}
{"text":"Thai Basil is the best Thai food I have ever had.  If you are a fan of Thai or have never tried it..it doesn't matter because you will love it.  My favorite thing is the Peanut Curry (Spicy).  It is so flavorful and large portions.  The service is very quick and they remember you when you come back.  One of the best restaurants in the Valley!!!"}
{"text":"At 12:45 pm, this place was packed. Some had to stay outside to wait for their seats. Good food, service and reasonable prices for a Thai restaurant. I would come back again next time when I am in town."}
{"text":"Food is always top notch. The mango roll has to be the best roll I've tried...  I visit very often."}
{"text":"A decent Thai place if you're close by but definitely not worth travelling for. The lunch special is a pretty good deal.  I thought the service was very prompt and polite but as far the food goes this is a good example of \"you get what you pay for\".  So don't expect to have your mind blown."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for over 10 years. It's my favorite Thai / sushi place! The service is always great. Thai Basil is the definition of a mom and pop restaurant. Frank (the owner) and his wife make us feel like we are part of the family. The prices are good and the food is amazing! The panang is my favorite. My son loves the bento boxes. You have to check it out!"}
{"text":"Great flavorful-fresh ingredients and would go back weekly if I could make it that often .. Decent prices, great chai tea:) Great environment to have lunch in (it does get quite busy) love it tho!"}
{"text":"Food was delicious quick in and out lunch on a Tuesday for 2 $21.00 including tip
Would have been a 5 star if I didn't run out of water."}
{"text":"The Tom Kha soup is the best exotic dish that I ever had this soup is delicious and a must try for soup lovers!"}
{"text":"I don't know what happen to the restaurant today, the wide noodle I ordered is so chopped and broken, looks like leftovers. It's so terrible."}
{"text":"The curry is too sweet for me but the fried rice is perfect! And the noodle is good too."}
{"text":"I have been eating at this Thai Basil location for the last 4 years. I love coming here. Not only is the red curry (my addiction) spectacular, but so is the service. We also have never had to wait long for food. Some people may think that the food is overpriced, but honestly I have found that they give you enough food for two meals. 

Definitely worth it! I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"The pad see ew was the worst I've ever had.  No flavor, no basil leaves, and greasy!  The Penang curry was pretty good and Tom yum was just alright.  Service was friendly."}
{"text":"I have only been to this establishment once but the one visit makes me want to go again! Quiet restaurant placed within a plaza location. The decor  and seating was very elegant with nice paintings and lighting. Great for family outings or a business meeting. The food was great. My girlfriend and I kept it light and ordered their lunch specials. Wait time was reasonable and not rushed like most Asian restaurants. They delivered and plateda nice tasting and eye catching meal.

Pad Thai Noodle
Thai Chicken Fried Rice

Both come with Vegetarian Spring Rolls and Tom Yum Thai Spicy & Sour soup (Very delicious appetizer)

Under $20"}
{"text":"Best Thai food I've had in Arizona! I've traveled all over the country And love trying new Thai spots. I'd definitely return for the thom kha soup, pad Thai and green curry."}
{"text":"The food was quite delicious, and we got it quickly.  The waitress was really sweet and helpful and went out of her way to make sure our food was perfect.  We had a strict carnivore, several omnivores, and a vegan in our group, and everyone was able to find something they liked.  Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Really good food. Nice waiters, nice place to eat with friends. There curry is good same with there noodles"}
{"text":"This is one of the best thai places! I have moved 5 times since I found Thai Basil and I still go out of my way to order there. My favorites are the curry dishes and the pad thai. Service is Good and fast."}
{"text":"I had lunch there a couple weeks ago and this past weekend took my wife there. We both liked the place. Food is good and the service and atmosphere nice. Not quite the best we've had but worth going back again when we are in that area."}
{"text":"The food was very good.  Chicken was high quality, I often opt out of the meat at thai places as I'm picky about rubbery chicken,  no need here.

Basil chicken dish was excellent.  I'm new to the area and will be going back for sure."}
{"text":"YUM!  Fantastic food, nice people.  The garlic eggplant and yellow curry are fabulous.  We are vegetarians and I appreciate that we can get so many things made veg. there.  I'm giving 4 stars only because I haven't tried a lot there - but what I have tried has been really really good."}
{"text":"The pineapple fried rice with a Thai iced tea is my go to order here.  I typically order it for carry out, but occasionally eat there.  The employees are always friendly and give good service.  There are much closer Thai restaurants by me, but it is worth the drive to go to this Thai Basil location!"}
{"text":"This is my favourite thai restaurant. Great pad thai (recommend with shrimp) and pineapple and coconut fried rice (served in actual pinapple/cocunut). Also, they have excellent mojitos!"}
{"text":"I was setting 5 minutes, but nobody give me drink  or menu , plz don't order the back young coconut seafood, it actually come without a coconut"}
{"text":"I always  look forward to eating at Thai Basil when I visit my daughter,who lives in Tempe. Thai Basil's food is consistently tasty, attractive and healthful.....lots of fresh vegetables, .rice and your choice of protein, with yummy curries or sauce.

I am originally a New Yorker,  who grew up with an abundance of ethnic foods and numerous restaurant choices, so I am fussy about my Thai  food.  Recently I brought a friend from Chicago to Thai Basil and she . . loved it too.  We both agreed that the food was delicious and fresh, the service was quick, the restaurant is clean and Troy is delightful!"}
{"text":"I am apprehensive when trying places that have too many different types of cuisines on the same menu.  How can a place that serves Thai food also serve sushi, and do it well?  In the case of Thai Basil, my apprehension was validated.  I went there for lunch because it is conveniently located near Aliante, and a friend recommended I try it.  I ordered the chicken panang curry, which was a huge disappointment.  It was bland, watery, and overly sweet.  I ate about three bites and couldn't eat any more.  Anyone could make much better curry at home with the paste in the can.  I saw their moderately priced sushi menu and decided to get a couple things, just to try it out.  If it was decent, I would order more.  I ordered the maguro and hamachi nigiri: another disappointment.  Both were horridly lukewarm (lukewarm sushi is one of my pet peeves), wafer-thin, and the sumeshi was unpleasantly hard.  The hamachi was sort of edible, and the maguro was flavorless and so full of gristle, it could pass for chewing gum.  The service was friendly, but slow.  I left the place, unhappy, unsatisfied, and still hungry.  I ended up going to the Taco Bell next door to get some quick grub to fill my tummy."}
{"text":"38weeks pregnant & craved for eating some yummy Thai food one last time before going into labor any minute now, but terribly & extremely disappointed. 

Ordered 4/5 spicy Tom Yum soup which was salty but neither sour nor spicy to the desired level. 4/5 Spicy vegetable fried rice came out super bland & comparatively lot more stickier than an usual Fried rice. So when we sent back food to add some spice, they sprinkled some hot chili powder on top but still overall the fried rice wasn't tasty. Last but not least, ordered vegetable rice paper rolls which were okay, but the sauces on the side for dipping were terrible.

So overall none of the dishes turned out good & regret coming here for fulfilling my Thai food craze one last time before child birth & starting my post-partum diet after. Oh btw, small thing but surprisingly our soup was the last item which came in much later than the Fried rice ..this never happened to us ever before."}
{"text":"Food was so yummy!! I couldn't make up mind mind and it took over 15 looks of the menu to make up my mind.
Lots of choices and all reasonably priced.
Our table ended up with spring rolls, tea, seafood grill, pineapple fried rice, chicken noodles, chow mien...it was all DELICIOUS! 
The service was great too! :)"}
{"text":"I have always enjoyed takeout from this restaurant, but I must admit I only order squash curry as it is my favorite Thai food. On this narrow basis, I would give the restaurant five stars. However, there are some negatives: the price is a little high for takeout and accessing the restaurant by car is awkward - and sometimes dangerous.

Nevertheless, I have always loved the food itself!"}
{"text":"I found that their food was always really tasty. I was hesitant to try it at first based on it's location but was surprised at how much I enjoyed it. My favourites include the tom yum soup, eggplant and they also make great cocktails."}
{"text":"- Service 2/10 

- Food 6/10

- Ambiance 4/10

I waited for 30 mins for my desert, when I asked the waiter was extremely rude"}
{"text":"The Thai Basil was delicious and reasonably priced.  Very quick service, highly recommended."}
{"text":"Not what I expected. I have been looking for a Chinese restaurant close to my house for a few weeks and I had real high hopes for this one. The staff is nice and the restaurant is clean, but the food was terrible:

Pork fried rice: Should re-name it saturated oil rice w/ pork.
Chicken Lo Mein: Not too bad, but no flavor.
Pepper Beef (Spicy): How do you cook a beef dish and make it taste like 3 day old dead fish? BLEH...
Sweet and Sour Chicken: My wife said it was ok, but not great.
Sticky Rice: Nailed it! 

Unfortunately, this was a to-go order so I just trashed most of my $36.27 dinner and am ordering a pizza instead."}
{"text":"10,000 hours to be an expert or 10,000 grains of rice to be a regular. I'm not sure which I would prefer when talking about Thai Basil, arguably the best Thai restaurant in Tempe. Although the area around ASU is inundated with local independent Thai spots, Thai Basil is the hottest (Sorry 5rcha, Thairama, and, Thai Elephant). In fact there are more than five indie Thai spots in the square mile are Mill and University! In a small sample, and quite casual, taste test with a few of my close colleagues, we found that Thai Basil not only has the most flavorful yellow curry, but it also has the freshest and best textured veggies to accompany their superlative sweet and spicy coconut base. The atmosphere is always set to tame lounge covers of pop songs, and mood lighting that settles the agitated or overwhelmed. An order of fresh rolls with the perfect hint of mint accompanied by a mellow rendition of Katy Perry's \"I Kissed a Girl\" is enough to make the wrong day right. Not only are they open until 10 p.m., which makes that post nine o'clock \"where do we go\" purgatorial discussion of fast food options fade, they also will carry your order over to Taste of Tops if you want to enjoy a your Thai dream in another seemingly moonlit establishment that offers the best in draft beers an absurd bottle selection.
The close by Tempe Farmers Market adds to the convenience of the location as many post dinner trips home are made complete with grabbing a few of those household necessities you've been meaning to get while you are out, or if you just want to sneak a quick vegan treat. The service is impeccable; I've never had a complaint let alone even heard a complaint about any of the staff or quality of the food. The one lone soul who spoke out against getting a bite there a few weeks prior was advocating we get Jack-In-The-Box on Mill, so you know their taste buds can't be trusted. 
The only problem that has ever arisen has been finding a parking spot, (literally one time out of dozens) which was quickly remedied by available street parking on Farmer. I will say the neighborhood and location are above average in general \"cool feel and vibe\" but if the ambiance is not to your liking, their take-out service is as convenient as any I've seen. The neighborhood part mostly goes for the University location, but the rest can be generalized to the other two, which I've patronized both and they maintain the standard set by their University site. 
I am not sure how one would be an expert at Thai Basil, as I previously suggested would be possible in my opening line, but over the years as I've slowly made my way into the \"regulars\" club with my idiosyncratic fried rice order, I know I wouldn't trade that status for anything. Maybe for some free entrees. Wait nevermind."}
{"text":"Went here on a first date.... the service was great, kept oit drinks full, and the curry was amazing! Excellent Thai food! Salmon tasted fresh, we couldn't have been happier, not to mention aawesome company!"}
{"text":"Great place to have a quick, affordable, filling and delicious meal!! I have been to this particular Thai Basil many times, both lunch and dinner. The food is always tasty, and service is great!

My favorite is the Red Curry (red pepper, bamboo shoots, carrots, green bean, basil in coconut milk base soup) with Chicken (I have at least ordered 5 out of 6 times I was here, it's that good!!!), and I usually have it in medium spicy. I ordered this again for tonight's dinner, and we also tried the Fried Banana and Ice Cream with Honey for dessert, sweet and delish!!"}
{"text":"I came here with my boyfriend and I ordered my thai favourite pad thai, and he ordered the fried rice in coconut. To be honest, i have had pad thai in so many thai restaurants including the west, but pad thai here really did not taste what I have expected. it did not even taste as good as a fast food thai place in BC. I tasted the fried rice in coconut, it looks very nice from the outside, and it tasted just like what we have expected. 
The service there was not bad, and I like their decoration inside their restaurant. it looks very sophisticated to us. 
I give this restaurant a 3 star mainly for its decoration and location."}
{"text":"The Panang curry was lacking sweetness and flavor and the vegetables were gigantic chunks! (Onion and peppers). My husband ordered pad thai and it was flavorless. 
Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Inexpensive, tasty, fast. The gentle peanut dressing on the pre-meal salad gets you started on a simple, no-frills meal with exactly one option from all of the classic dishes you expect at a Thai restaurant in America: massaman, red, green, yellow, or panang curry; pad thai or chowmein; meat or vegetable rice plates. There's nothing extravagant in spices or food choices, but you can order the spiciness level to you liking."}
{"text":"Great red curry, pad thai, and rice. They can make it as spicy as you want, but you have to ask them to make it thai spicy to some degree."}
{"text":"After my visit to Thai Basil yesterday, I realized that Thai Basil means great food and lousy service. 

I really enjoyed my plate. I decided to try something I've never had and went with the Pineapple fried rice with chicken. There is also some curry mixed in. The dish was great. I do wish there was more chicken. There wasn't much chicken overall.

I also sampled my wife's pad thai and was also really good. She was jealous of my selection though.

Where do I begin about the service? We were sat down promptly and then proceeded to wait quite awhile before the sever came back to take our drink/food order. Since this was a long delay we ordered our drinks and food at the same time. We waited for the food for about 10-15 minutes (which was fine), but guess what, no drinks still! Slowly, two plates come out, no drinks. A few minutes pass and my plate arrives. We ask again and finally our drinks arrive. WTF? 

The server must have been new, inexperienced at handling a couple of tables, just bad or a combo of all of them. As I ate, the two tables next to us had to deal with similar experiences. The folks next to us had to wait about the entire time we ate to get their check. At least our payment only took about 5 minutes. 

I found the service provided unacceptable! One of the worst experiences I've had. I'm just happy the food helped ease the blow of the ineptitude.  

With better service this place can easily be a 4.

I hope next time the service is better at Thai Basil, because the food is very good. Maybe I'll save myself the trouble and get take out."}
{"text":"So the food is still amazing. I'd probably say best Thai in York region. When I last ate in, I ordered pad Thai (I know, how adventurous of me). I wanted some more cilantro but was told it's an extra dollar. WTF? Like how about I walk a few doors down to the grocery store and buy a whole bunch for $.80?

Who charges for cilantro?

The manager (who quite honestly should be the owner, she is so dedicated and works really hard), said she can't do anything about it, owners said anything extra... Peanuts, cilantro, sauce, whatever you want is $1 extra. 

Apparently it's getting more expensive for them to operate, so rather than raise their prices, or find a more efficient way to operate, they're just gouging customers on any and every little addition or even convenience. How rude!

Maybe next they'll charge for toilet paper and napkins. 

I definitely eat there less... I used to be a weekly customer. Now, if I can, I choose Salad King. It's downtown but it's just as good, if not better and ways busier. So you know it'll always remain super fresh."}
{"text":"Disappointed with the quality of late ... we ordered the shrimp fried rice, coconut rice and pad thai and very disappointed with the taste and quality. Service was good, but poor taste and flavors. Disappointed and will not be visiting them again."}
{"text":"Absolutely not Authentic. Their lunch menu is great though,  at about $10 you get a small bowl of Tomyum, a spring-roll and one main dish. The dinner is on the pricy side and rice is not included. I tried their baked coconut seafood and panning curry, imo they were toooooo sweet. Definitely not going back again for dinner."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times; the first couple of times I was into it, especially the sweet potato appetizer.  But the last few times I have visited, it has been very underwhelming, and with so many other Thai restaurants popping up in the area, there are better options.  

On my last visit I ordered Rama's Favorite, and I found it to be inedible.  It tasted like boiled beef in a peanut sauce that was somehow laking the peanut flavor....gross!  The Thai Basil chicken also seemed to have lost some of its previous greatness.  If I were to be coerced into dining here again, I would stick to something simple and safe like the Pad Thai."}
{"text":"Its a decent thai food, had ordered drunken noodles with chicken, it was alright. I am basing my standards off the food I Have tried in Thailand, this was verrry \"americanised\" version of thai food.. Overall, mehh.."}
{"text":"Delicious food, fast service, fair price, quiet location: What else do you want/need? We selected spring rolls, Pad Thai, Panang Curry, and the Drunken Noodle with chicken. We appreciated the fresh basil in the spring rolls and the peanut sauce was excellent. The Panang was a notch too spicy, so make sure you order appropriately. The Drunken Noodle was great, but could have used a few more vegetables. 

So, get out of the McDonald's drive thru line and enjoy some fresh Thai food at Thai Basil. Support our Aliante area small businesses!"}
{"text":"Hole in the wall spot but I'm not too impressed. Got the Combination  Vermicelli which needed more variety of meat. I also got the fried tofu which wasn't too great. I usually go to this Thai restaurant on Lake mead or one on durango, but I figure since this one was closer to home I would give it a try. Maybe the other dishes are better. Since the service was fast, I may give it one more shot."}
{"text":"The red curry with chicken is very good. I usually order my meals in advance and pick it up 20 min later. Service is not bad"}
{"text":"I am from Washington, and am thus pretty spoiled by the Asian food I have eaten in my life. My favorite thai restaurant at home had a head chef who was the owner's Thai mother (he literally brought her from Thailand to cook authentic Thai)... so, yeah. I know my thai food. 

This place is AWESOME. I have no idea what the bad reviews are referring to- because this food is delicious. Appetizers are incredibly affordable (especially during happy hour)- let me recommend the chicken satay and spring rolls to start. 

I have wanted here many times and have enjoyed several of their curries, fried rices, and pad thai- NEVER disappointed. Try the sweet peanut curry- it will rock your world. Their peanut sauce is also amazing, and as a side with their pad thai... oh yes.

I am also a sometimes-vegetarian, and their dishes all give you the option of what kind of protein, which I think is awesome. Their tofu is flash fried and then added, which helps it maintain shape and texture. Did I mention it was delicious?

Survey says: go here. Eat their delicious food. Thank me later!"}
{"text":"So, I ordered Yellow Curry with Chicken & Cheese Rolls for an Appetizers. The Curry I ordered Mild and asked to give me some Chile paste on the side because I split it with a friend and she doesn't like spicy food. as soon as I saw it come out I could see it was spicy but I took it anyway. It was very spicy not overwhelming but not Mild at all. Other then the spice there was no real flavor to the curry. There was barely meat I know we split it but we both go like two small pieces. It kinda suck because I have been wanting to try this place for awhile now and now I'm not sure if I'll ever go back.. I doubt If I go back anytime soon"}
{"text":"really good food!! flavorful and all staff is super friendly everytime.   only thing ive noticed is that its usually pretty cold inside.

tip! try the panang curry, really nice :)"}
{"text":"My brother and I love this place!!! Pad Thai is amazing. Spicy Basil is our favorite for sure. Tom Kah and Tom Yum soups are very good. The staff are always so friendly. Their delivery service is great and always arrives hot."}
{"text":"We love this place! The yellow curry is an absolute must try. We also like the pineapple fried rice, the service is great. Do not forget to try the Thai iced tea, it is delicious!"}
{"text":"We went a couple weeks ago to Thai Basil for a dinner. That was our first visit and we decided to order dishes staff suggested as most popular. I had Pad Thai and some squid appetizer. Unfortunately, Pad Thai was completely bland and absolutely tasteless. I love Thai food  but this joint really didn't impressed me at all. Prices are quite decent therefore it all balances out."}
{"text":"I ordered the Lunch Thai Basil Rice for pick up.   I have been to nearly every thai restaurant in my area (Thai Rama, Swaddee, Thai Elephant, and many many more..) this is the only place I've ever picked up from that had the white rice separate from the vegetables, sauce, etc.  It was more of a curry style (where the white rice is separate from the curry part) which I was disappointed in. I asked for thai Hot 4 (the spiciest they go) still not spicy or hot.  Barely any red flakes or peppers.  I won't be going back. Was just sub par.

(FYI, the best place I've had Thai food is Thai Rama in Chandler and, on the west side is Line Thai in Sun City)"}
{"text":"Food was all right/decent. Service is wanting. No, humiliating. There is a certain sauce (simple sweet hot sauce, the clear sugar and red chili sauce) I requested. They had no idea of what I was requesting. I tried to describe more than once. My mistake. The waitress rolled her eyes , said something loudly, from near the door, to the kitchen staff in a snarky tone of voice that elicited laughter from the kitchen. I don't like to think I'm paranoid, however, I think they dissed me to my face. With glee.

Mind you, I am not a rude person. I thought I was asking about the sauce in a courteous tone. Others reviewers have cited the lack of good customer service and lack of respect for their customers. Perhaps it is not paranoia after all."}
{"text":"I've been here on a few occasions and have never been let down. Great Thai for a great price."}
{"text":"I'm not sure where to start. This was my first experience at any downtown restaurant in Phoenix. Food was good, service seemed to be good and all of a sudden our lunch was ruined. There were four of us and my back was to  the kitchen. One of my coworkers pointed out a roach coming out of the kitchen to the cash register area. As we set and watched we saw at least three roaches. The place was so packed I didn't want to mention it to a waitress or anyone. I was worried it would alert everyone inside the restaurant. 

As we left we all became angrier as the day passed by. I tried to call and could not communicate with the woman who answered. After googling the health hazards of roaches I was disgusted and worried that this place would allow this problem to affect their customers. I decided to post in on yelp, against what I would typically do, because I am concerned about the health hazards. I called the county health inspectors and they told me they were already familiar with the problem and were encouraging the restaurant to get it fixed asap. I'm disappointed I don't know more people to warn. The place seemed to be a place that stays packed most of the day."}
{"text":"I loved the bell chimes as you walk in 
So tranquil and welcoming 
Loved the decor of the restaurant 
Very tasteful very home like 


I was dining alone 
Seated in a nice corner 
And given a little bit of time to settle before asked if I was ready to order 

This was my first time here 
So I was really hesitant about my order 
I went with the Moo Goo Gai Pan but spicy 

I asked for lemon water also 
I
Received lime water instead ... No biggie 

My food arrives and it wasn't placed in front of me 
Never been to restaurant where I had to reach for my own food .. Because it was placed so far from where I was seated 

The rice wasn't very tender .. 
 The middle of my dish was hot 
But the outer parts were cold 
The chicken wasn't the best but it wasn't terrible
All together it was tasteful just flawed 

Customer service was great until it was time to pay 
Which is backwards but ok 

Would I visit again 
Probably not 
But the place is very beautiful and the prices are very affordable"}
{"text":"Super friendly owner who is more than happy to give recommendations and cater the ingredients and spiciness to your taste. It's much faster than other Thai places around, both in terms of service and delivery. While they only have two dine in tables, you can usually find a spot without a problem as most people take out or order delivery. The food is great and the portions are good. There is even free delivery for orders over $20. You can't go wrong with this place!

Recommendations: Drunken noodle, green curry (the eggplant is delicious!), pad thai. Basically everything on their menu. I will say that I got their Thai Iced Tea once, and while it was good, about 60% of it was ice, but it's not a big deal to me."}
{"text":"Tried Spicy noodle and Drunken noodle and both the dishes were just okay! I live in DC metro region and have had much much better. Service was good."}
{"text":"Not a fan. Ordered delivery. Pad Thai is bland and yellow curry is way too milky. No flavor in the food. Portion size is good . Food not so much . Going to cook a party pizza . Thai tea is good ."}
{"text":"If you like Thai food you need to eat here! I love the food here! I come here with my boyfriend often. We only go during happy hour because I only order the beef salad which is half off during that time and it is AMAZING! The papaya salad is also very good! He always orders the hot and sour soup and it's the best hot and sour soup we've ever tried."}
{"text":"Terrible Thai food. It is not authentic from ingredient to cooking method !!!  Pad Thai without bean sprout! Super Small portion plus slow service"}
{"text":"The food is good overall, and the lunch menu is good value. Most meals are average compared to other Thai joints in the area, but do not order the Pad Thai.  It is bland, and really rather tasteless. However, there is a large menu with lots to choose from. 

Nice atmosphere, and service is quite good. Prices are reasonable. A decent place for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"The Hampton Inn front desk person told me to walk toward the back of the hotel, there would be several restaurants. I chose this restaurant and sat outside for the weather was very pleasant. The place was not very busy from the seatings outside but the waitress did not come until 5 minutes later. I ordered the papaya salad and it was not as expected for I have frequent numerous Thai restaurants so I know. There was some papaya lying on a bed of chopped up lettuce with a few peanuts and two shrimps. I guess shrimps are scared here. I missed my dried shrimps on my papaya though. The sauce was fine but not hot as I requested. The portion was alright but I was still hungry and ordered the calamari. The second dish came out pretty quickly and it was good. After the meal, I asked for my bill and again I had to wait.

Overall, this is not a bad Thai restaurant and the food was not bad. I had better! The service was slow."}
{"text":"One recent, very rainy, afternoon my girlfriends and I were looking for somewhere to eat along bloor. We decided on Thai Basil because it was right across the street and that's about as far as we were willing to walk in the downpour.

We were pleasantly surprised. We shared three items - green curry, garlic and basil eggplant, and spicy noodles. One of my friends is vegetarian, so the items were sans viande. 

The curry and noodles were both good. Not mind blowingly so, but solid. And the eggplant dish was a complete delight, richly flavoured and striking a good balance between the basil and the garlic. We oohed and aahed a fair bit.

The service, however, was barely adequate. We were approached at least six times before we were ready to order and felt a bit nagged. From there in we had to focus really hard to catch someone so that we could order food and additional drinks. At the end of the meal we sat and sat and sat with plates in front of us waiting for a chance to ask for the bill. It's no worse than the majority of restos in this city, but still lacking.

I'd go back, though. Inexpensive, yummy, well-located, and the service was just lacking, not rude."}
{"text":"Ive been here multiple times and out of all the Tempe area Thai houses, this is my favorite. The Pad zee ew is the best, especially with the thai coffee to go with it."}
{"text":"My criteria for three stars is this: Would I go back? Yes. Definitely.
Was I impressed with their food? It's standard fare, presented cleanly and efficiently and at a very fair price. The lunch special that includes a small salad, a slice of watermelon and an egg roll is a great deal.
I was able to take a coworker who usually sticks his nose up at anything that isn't buffalo wings, pizza or a chain like PeiWei."}
{"text":"This place is cute and quaint and just plain good. We have been going here for years and never had a bad meal. We go for lunch, HH and dinner and everything is great. I love the Thai Tea !!!"}
{"text":"Tried the singapore noodles which i have tried at many many places and this was by far the worse Singapore noodles i have ever had. The fried rice was also so tasteless that i had to cook my own curry chicken to add flavor. Drunken noodles were by far the worse meal ever. This was my first and last time eating here."}
{"text":"I keep a running log of all the great places that I have eaten when I travel.  Thai Basil made the list and I'm just getting around to giving my review.  Never fear, I take good notes while I eat so I can remember the specifics.  

When I eat Thai, I usually get satay and the Pad Thai.  I do that for two reasons... 1.) cause I like satay and Pad Thai 2.) to keep it consistent when I review.  I have something to compare it too.

Thai Basil's Pad Thai was very good.  The prices was reasonable too.  If I remember, I think I ate dinner and was stuffed for about $17, including my iced tea.   I would certainly recommend Thai Basil for anyone going to Phoenix or the Phoenix area. I believe they are a local chain."}
{"text":"The service was OK.
Green curry was actually good, maybe a bit too salty, as well as the salad.
The soup was like POISON, it was way too salty.
Pad Thai did not taste authentic.
Price - average.
BIG PROBLEM: TOO MUCH SALT!"}
{"text":"I came here for a quick lunch as it is less then a block away from one of my work locations. I got their signature dish thai basil, and I chose tofu for my protein. The salad was a surprise to me, and I enjoyed it, and as other reviews said the dressing was really good.. The food came out really quick, which is perfect  for a work lunch break. I was looking for healthy and tasty, and this hit the spot. Very light flavors, but flavorful enough. The vegetables tasted fresh with that slight crispness that I like, and the spring roll was a nice addition. Not every restaurant can pull off tofu well, but they definitely did. I think this is a great spot for something light, relatively healthy, and quick."}
{"text":"Thai Basil is a fantastic little Thai restaurant. The food is delicious and relatively affordable. Even more important the food comes out fast and the service is excellent. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a great lunch spot, or anyone who loves spicy food. Beware of ordering your food \"Thai spicy\" unless your capable of eating extremely spicy cuisine. I usually order my food \"regular spicy\", which is still pretty hot."}
{"text":"Food was good. Order the pad thai.  Wife and i go all the time"}
{"text":"This has been my go-to Thais restaurant in Phoenix for about five years! It's quick, fresh and delicious. The staff are very helpful and friendly. I love the spicy noodles, the siamese chow mein and the signature Thai basil dish. Thai iced tea is always good too! As with any restaurant, the lunch prices are better than the dinner prices. Plus, lunch comes with a salad! Either way, it's a great place."}
{"text":"I was going to this restaurant everytime I was in downtown and food was always good.
Went for lunch today, had a lunch special with Pad See Ew. Tofu was cold and not enough soya sous in the noodles.  It was definitely Pad See Eewww...
Service was poor.
Do not think will be back again."}
{"text":"Myself and a friend ate here last night. I am flabbergasted at the positive reviews! The food was awful. I had the Pad Sew Ew. I was tasteless. My friend had the Basil Beef. The beef was tough-virtually inedible and the rest of the food was just noodles dumped on a plate. Where were the Thai flavours? Not in the food here! The vegetarian Spring Rolls were greasy. The restaurant itself is small and was so hot that it was smoky inside. The service was fine. The clientele that comes here often obviously do not care about the quality of the food. They just care that it is cheap and plentiful. Just gross!! Fast food Thai is better than this slop!!"}
{"text":"Best Thai food ever!!!!!!! Excellent food. Excellent service. I can't say enough as to how awesome Thai Basil is. One of those hidden gems. Don't miss."}
{"text":"The food was delicious. Got the red curry with beef. Wife got fried rice. We'll be going back."}
{"text":"The food at this restaurant is excellent, but the service is awful. Rude servers, food coming out sporadically, no rhyme or reason as to what is coming out (we ended up with our soup in the middle of our meal, which took two hours to complete).  It's unfortunate that a restaurant with such good food provides such bad service.  Not sure if I'll eat there again."}
{"text":"the food was absolutely lovely and the service was impeccable! 

we went at the lunch hour special time where any entrée that was on the list came with a small soup of tom yum goong (arguably the dish that most represents thailand - sweet, tangy, and delicious) and one scrumptious vegetarian springroll.

 i ordered the fried rice and pad thai that were both good, yet sweet, and had a more westernized type of taste.

the service was amazing! the staff seemed to have a small amount of workers but they were extremely nice and friendly!"}
{"text":"Thai Basil never disappoints! We love calling ahead and going to pick up the delicious, mouth watering, authentic Thai food. Soooo good!! Everything my husband and I have tried here is a winner! Our favorites are the Tom Ka Gai soup, the drunken noodles and the signature dish: Thai Basil. Always ready in about 15 min!! Now my stomach is growling just thinking of the food!!"}
{"text":"Food wasn't good at all  Not even thai coffee.! Find somewhere else to eat save yourself a disappointment."}
{"text":"I have been going to Thai Basil since it was Thai Orchid. The menu is expected with great descriptions and prompt delivery.  I am only giving 4 stars because to me \"native Thai\" usually offers some heat. This Basil's 4 star heat was not even warm."}
{"text":"Food was delicious and taste good. I would said it is authentic Thai food. Green curry chicken and mango salad are taste good, it is similar as what I had in Asia, Thailand."}
{"text":"Thai Basil on Central is one of the best Thai restaurants I've ever eaten at. I've made this a regular place to go to. Their food is amazing, especially their silver noodles and spring rolls! They have great service, and you can order to-go orders which are prepared quickly and just as good as if you were eating it at the restaurant. They are located in a great area with a lot of parking."}
{"text":"Been curious about this place for a couple years and decided to finally try.
Less than impressed. I ordered tom kha goong or coconut soup, pad thai. 

Pad Thai: Extremely chewy like eating seaweed rubber bands and the flavor lacked.

Tom Kha Goong: Too much cocunut milk and not enough broth, also veggies were tossed in broth completely raw after soup was poured into a bowl. 

Overall I will keep looking for a more suitable Thai food restaurant."}
{"text":"I just had the spicy fried rice and chicken pad Thai. So good! The fish in the fried rice was plentiful and overall portion is very good for the amount you pay for. Friendly man who took my order and nice delivery guy. Overall great experience and happy for a legit Thai restaurant in Wisconsin!"}
{"text":"Quick service and server was nice. Food was good but not mind blowing. If it was possible to give 3.5 stars, that's probably where it should be. I had their signature dish and it was pretty good. Worth going to but not worth going out of your way to try."}
{"text":"They took 50 minutes to bring three bowles of pho out... They forgot my coke, so I got up and got the soda myself... Make the trip to Spring Mountain Rd. instead people... Bad tast, bad customer service..."}
{"text":"This place was a huge disappointment. I would highly suggest you try somewhere else if you want a consistent and enjoyable experience. The menu is really hit or miss.. and by miss, I mean epic fail.

The coconut soup we ordered as an appetizer was so horrid.. lacking real flavor  or ingredients - but lots of fish sauce - extra salty :( Nothing like any pictures posted on here -- thats for sure! Their Spring rolls were a huge let down.. how hard is it to make a spring roll? Apparently super hard at Thai Basil - the coating was super thick - you could barely bite into them...

My husband ordered peking duck and his takeaway thought was - this food isn't fit for human consumption. YUCK. It was PLASTERED in bbq sauce and the meat itself tasted like luncheon meat. Totally gross. It did not taste authentic and was truly laughable as a dish.. except when we saw the bill and the cost for a couple of pieces of garbage mystery meat and a load of bbq sauce.. Could they really be serious? Wow..

I ordered yellow curry which was okay -- but overall.. not worth ANYTHING but a bad review on yelp. Super disappointing as we came along way to try this place out.

Whoever claimed this place is a Michelin star quality establishment was either paid by Thai basil to write that review or is a part owner of that business.. because their food is FAR from good - let alone Michelin quality.

The service was lacking. 

Diner beware...."}
{"text":"A hidden gem in North Vegas.  We're especially fond of the sushi happy hour from 3-6 pm.  The freshest ingredients beautifully made, and the front side of the sushi menu is half price.

Many Vegas residents consider Archi's the go-to Pad Thai in town.  Thai Basil's is less sweet and more balanced in flavor.  I'll take it over Archi's hands down.

And Thai Basil does one free refill on their Thai tea.  I don't know any restaurant in Vegas that offers that.  Amazing.

Seriously, eat here."}
{"text":"For $10 you easily get two meals. I live right down the street and come here weekly. I've had quite a few different things but usually stick to a few of my favorites:

Red curry- so delicious. if you like spicy foods get double thai hott as the coconut milk/ dilutes the heat. The veggies are also crispy and tasty. 

Thai Basil- their signature dish. Get it with beef. This is really good over rice. 

Fresh rolls- I get them with chicken. They are made to order (unlike some places). Especially good with the plum sauce they serve them with.

Really good place to eat!"}
{"text":"The place is quite nice and cozy from inside and service was also good. My fav are the chilli fried noodles. The Penang curry was not very peanuty in taste. The shrimps in chilli paste were fantastic"}
{"text":"Food is great I have been going there for years. 

I recommend the red curry and the pad see ew. Yum! :)

The people are great too! They know my daughter and are SO good to her."}
{"text":"I've probably eaten at this place 3 times already in the past couple months. GREAT service and the food is delicious. The pad thai is probably the best I've had. The curry is also great! I've tried the yellow and the green curry. Came with white rice. From what I've noticed, the staff makes sure to greet AND say goodbye to everyone--which is what a good business is all about. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We love the food here.  Everything we've tried has tasted great, although the spice level can be disappointing to someone who loves spice.

We have had some communication issues when ordering but have always gotten the correct order. Certainly worth supporting this great ethnic restaurant!"}
{"text":"This location has a nice decor and a good lunch menu. Lunch specials come with a spring roll (that comes piping hot) and a soup (which is amazing). I ordered the pad thai, but wasn't that impressed with it. The green curry, which my friend ordered, was great; it had the right amount of spice to it"}
{"text":"I eat here all the time! The Pad Thai is amazing and the portions are so big I can usually eat it for two meals."}
{"text":"I come here for the lunch specials as they are priced pretty well. My favourite dish they sell is by far the tom yum soup. I cant get enough of it.. Its spicy yet savoury at the same time. The pad thai is also very good but sometimes the tofu tastes off. Overall a good restaurant to go to for a cheap lunch."}
{"text":"Catered Thai Basil for my company for a going away party. Was extremely impressed with both the service and the quality of the food. Catering was for 75 employees, but definitely received more food then needed to feed everyone. Jay the owner was extremely helpful and the whole family came to drop our order off. Great family owned business, would absolutely suggest to anyone especially if you are catering a lunch :)"}
{"text":"I give it 5 stars because they remember me. They're friendly. They're clean. My choices are always delicious. I don't eat any meat and they have options for me! Their spice level is tolerable as I am not a spicy kind of gal ;) All in all I come here a lot and I'll keep coming back unless I move!"}
{"text":"I really don't like giving poor reviews, but it went right in the trash so I felt like I had to. 
The restaurant is mediocre AT BEST. I relocated to the area and have been trying to find my favorite spots. I was so disappointed how poor the food is. 
This restaurant completely missed the mark. The first thing my fiancé said was, It doesn't taste like Thai food. 
And I'm sad to say I could have made the basil rice myself.  Go elsewhere. If anyone has an authentic Thai restaurant suggestion, please let me know."}
{"text":"I love Thai food.  I've been going here for years and have traveled extensively through Thailand, so I think I can safely say I know good Thai food.  The Thai food here is excellent and fairly priced.  There's a reason I keep coming back."}
{"text":"This place is soo good!!!  it is soo much better than pei wei and all those other chains. The food is delicous! they ask you how spicy you want it the food is made very quickly and just overall is soo good. the rice is never dry, the veggies are delightful, I would recommend the sweet and sour plate"}
{"text":"My family and I were just passing through town looking for a decent bite and decided to resort to the Mall we were passing, and boy did we luck out!  The service was prompt, helpful and friendly and the food was delicious and inexpensive.  Even the kids were happy, and we're all pretty spoiled with a great Thai restaurant just down the way (if you're ever in Southern Marin, I recommend Thep Lela!), so we were very grateful to the travel gods that day, I can tell you."}
{"text":"Thai Basil is most likely the best Thai food restaurant in town. The pad thai is delicious!"}
{"text":"One of the best place to have Thai Food.. It's awesome... The vegan items are too good :-) A must go place for some good food"}
{"text":"Excellent pad thai on the west side, highly recommend if you're looking for something tasty on this side of town! If the prices were just a little lower, I'd be even more excited about this place. But $10 pad thai for one person is a lot to me, since I'm used to the $5 version from downtown food carts (which is just as tasty)."}
{"text":"The yellow chicken curry is absolutely delicious. The staff is friendly and service is quick. I love this place."}
{"text":"We only order for delivery. The food is always great. The delivery folks are always pleasant and ontime.  Great pad Thai and masamun."}
{"text":"Thai Basil is close to my home and my standard 'take out' place for Thai.  My favorite is the Squash Curry.  They recently changed their 'fresh' roll to a 'garden' roll and I'm not a fan of that change - the garden roll is basically a bunch of lettuce with dipping sauce.  The Pad Thai is good."}
{"text":"Love it!!! I lived within blocks of this restaurant for over a year before I tried it, which was my mistake.  My friends and I have a theory that they drug their food because it is so addictive.  Their Green Curry is heavenly and I go back & forth between getting it with Chicken or Tofu.  The Thai Basil is good too.  Try the spring rolls. The take out portions are not skimpy, and the veggies are always fresh & perfectly cooked. This restaurant is one of my favorites."}
{"text":"I love their lunch menu. I am a huge fan of the complementary spring roll, salad and soup! YUM!! I adore the eggplant and pork dish in their lunch menu and always go there for this dish. Their pad thai and curries are also very good. The reason I knocked off one star is because they aren't as good as my favourite thai place and there's no complementary dishes outside of lunch special :("}
{"text":"Food:
Yellow Curry Seafood Stir Fried w/ soft shell crab:
Favourite dish here. The curry was creamy, mild, and had a very good milky/sweet taste to it. Good portion size.

Baked Yellow Curry Seafood in a Coconut: pretty much the same taste as above, but this one had so many tiny ginger slices in it

Service:
Service was always pretty fast but sometimes not quite friendly"}
{"text":"I went for dinner last night. The Pad Thai with chicken I ordered was delicious, a huge portion, and reasonably priced. The service was decent. I will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"3.5 start review!!

I came here on weeknight with a party of 4.  

I ordered the: 
vegetable green curry  - really tasty and flavorful
chicken panang curry - tender chicken (and lots of it), really nice heavy sauce.
spring rolls - nothing special, i wouldn't order them again.

You could probably share of curry order between two people.  Rice is not included in the order, so you have to order it separately.

Service was good and food was quite enjoyable.  Wait staff was constantly around and refilling our water."}
{"text":"Don't get the bad reviews for this place!?! We have ordered from here many times over the last few years and had good experiences every time. The manhattan and bonzai rolls are probably my favorite. We also order entrees, noodles, and curries. Big fan of the pineapple fried rice and yaki soba! On top of everything, THEY DELIVER!!!"}
{"text":"We went here once a week for the year my husband was in grad school.   The food is a 4, but the waitresses are a 5.   It was a half mile from our apartment and so we would walk there and walk back to work off the huge portions.    This is the only restaurant in my life where I could consider myself a regular.   We never really talked with the waitresses or knew their names, but they always knew what I wanted; I didn't have to order.  They always gave me water with no ice no lemon, my husband's with ice and lemon, gave me my panang curry with chicken medium and waited for my husband to choose what he wanted. He probably ordered most of the items on the menu.  They refilled my rice if I ran out without asking.  Our bill always came to $19.53 for dinner more times than I can remember.  We went maybe twice for lunch, but almost always for dinner.  My husband graduated last month and we moved from Tempe but we miss this place dearly."}
{"text":"I decided on grabbing some Thai food last minute, read reviews and dined at Thai Basil. Very yummy food :) Good customer service! I saw a few people stop in for take out orders while I was there, so I know that's available too. My only dislike was that the Thai iced tea was WAY too sweet; I wasn't able to finish it :(
I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here for lunch about once a month over the past year, and will continue.

I must admit that I've only had the Pad Thai. This isn't because I don't like or want to try other options. It is because the Pad Thai is so good that I keep wanting to experience it one more time. :)"}
{"text":"Walked over for dinner while staying at the nearby Hampton Inn.  I went here largely on yelp reviews and was not disappointed.  I ended up doing take out, but ordered the penang with chicken (spicy) with rice.

The flavor was right on (almost like being in thailand) and the portion was a good size for the price.  I was also impressed that it was fairly spicy (not ridiculous) but nice and tasty.  The staff was friendly although my interaction was minimal."}
{"text":"Sad to say that I won't be returning to Thai Basil- shocking because I used to come here quite frequently.

The service is just too terrible to be overlooked. Our waitress refused to split the bill for us, so one friend ended up paying for the entire group's meals! Another waitress hit me with some plates (accidentally, but still forcefully) and didn't apologize. Lastly when clearing our table she kept telling us to pass all of the cutlery/plates on the table to her in a very rude tone.

The eggplant/chili with tofu is good. The hot and sour soup that comes with the lunch special is inedible (too salty). The spring rolls are also good. Those are probably the only redeeming things about this place. Garlic beef and broccoli comes with about 4 tiny broccoli pieces."}
{"text":"The service here is pretty good, they could give you more attention, but they are very friendly. The food here is great! It is always fresh and exactly how you like it. My father and I come here every month its become a wonderful 'daddy-daughter date\" place of ours. I recommend it to all family and couples."}
{"text":"The food is not bad, it comes out quick . However , the service beyond that is a tad slow and what really made me rate them a three was that because I was paying the check for all five people in my party the bill was automatically increased from 9.95 a meal to 12.50 a meal. I am generally a great tipper even if the service is bad or mediocre ; but if you tell me how much I will tip on a table of five and then not disclose that in the menu or up front, well that is just poor business etiquette and for that reason I will never go back nor will I recommend it to anyone ."}
{"text":"Only been to this one Thai place in Phoenix, but it's so goo I don't need to go anywhere else.  Great, friendly staff.  Have brought friends from out of town who have loved the food too. Glad to randomly find this place."}
{"text":"It's hard to find perfectly executed Panang Curry, but Thai Basil is a consistent winner.  Occasionally their sauce is a little runnier than I prefer, but the flavor is always excellent.  I've tried a couple of other items on their menu as well, but I love the curry dish so much I rarely order anything else.  It's definitely worth the wait or call in for carry out.  Lunch pricing is reasonable too.  Only four stars because it's just too darn small in there and for the inconsistent sauce prep.  Overall a great place to get Thai food in Tempe."}
{"text":"Its always helpful having someone dine with you who has never eaten a certain culinary style. a new view on thai food allows you to really understand what attracts more seasoned eaters in to the food in the first place.


 we took a friend who had never had thai food to the lunch special at the Thai Basil on bloor today. the decour was nice, sleek and clean, and the value of salad, soup, a spring roll and entree was amazing.all for 6 bucks.


 However, the food was nothing special, a safe rendition of somthing we have had dozens of time before. if you not looking for the greatest Thai food of your life, than thai basil is fine. But dont come expecting the flavour knob to be turned up to 11"}
{"text":"I lived in South East Asia for a few months and gained an appreciation for the region's great food...so I can be picky about the Thai/Cambodian/Vietnamese food I eat here in my new home town.

Thai Basil was perfectly satisfying - reasonable price, yummy Thai Basil Chicken (can't help but love it when my cheeks flush a little bit from the heat:).

As others have mentioned - the ambiance is nice (especially relative to other places on the Annex section of Bloor which seem take take their location and price as a sufficient excuse for completely forgetting about decor). The service was fine - I was with a large group that was disorganized and ordered things out of sequence but it was all sorted out just fine.

Since I am in the area frequently I will be back, but other wise it is just another Thai place that is better than Spring Rolls."}
{"text":"i have been coming here for years and i love it.  the chicken and beef feel and taste like chicken and beef rather than fatty and chewy like other places.  i don't eat sushi so i can't comment but almost everything I've ordered is good.  i think the tempura is bland but I'm not a big fan anyway.  it's a little hidden behind Taco Bell but worth finding."}
{"text":"delicious, yet not completely authentic. Having grown up in Thailand I'd say these dishes are not completely authentic or the best but from all the many Thai American restaurants I've eaten at thought the States this has got to be one of the best."}
{"text":"The food is so so with poor service. This place is dirty. The wonton soup we ordered taste like soup from the can. I had terrible diarrhea when I got home. We don't recommend this place unless you are willing to take the risk of having possible E.coli infection. Our family and friends were disappointed. This is one of the place in our blacklist. :("}
{"text":"Service really needs help.  One thing that's consistent: they always seem to be understaffed. Twice have ordered and waited, waited, and waited, while everyone around you is servered.  I've canceled the order and walked out.  Too many other choices to spend my money."}
{"text":"This place is so good. I their peanut curry is amazing and I love the Thai iced tea. The place is kind of small so there might be a wait if you go during busy times but it's worth the wait. The restaurant itself is nicely decorated with good lighting and comfortable seats. I've done the take out too and it's just as good as eating there."}
{"text":"Nice lunch specials, with salad, tom yum, a spring roll and an entree starting from 7 dollar + tax.  Nice ambiance too.  Though, I must warn, this is very tame Thai food; good, but a bit bland.  If the Pad Thai (which was too sweet, in my view...can't rule out ketchup as an ingredient) and the green curry are any indication, flavors are dulled down here.  Sigh...."}
{"text":"Great food for a reasonable price. Location is good and the food comes fast. Portion size is good, and the staff are fast. Turnaround time is usually 10-15 so really quick!"}
{"text":"Truly a disappointing Thai restaurant .
My husband and I usually drive all the way to Weera Thai off Sahara which is AMAZING, but they were closed for renovations so we decided to check this place out since it was close. BIG mistake. Atmosphere is cute, but the food was such a disappointment. 
It's a Thai restaurant but they had a limited selection of food. My husband ordered Pad See Ewe and it was very bland. 
Thai food is usually full of flavor. I wanted Tom Kah with seafood and was willing to pay extra, but he said it was only chicken unless I wanted to order the big bowl. I got the tom Kah and it was bland and hardly tasted like coconut. I asked for Thai chili or Thai chili powder because he didn't even ask me how spicy I wanted my soup and he brought me regular chili powder. 
I also order some nigiri rolls and without asking they already put wasabi under the fish which I found weird and displeasing since I'm not a fan of wasabi and every sushi place or restaurant that serves sushi I've been to has never put it on the sushi without asking the customer first. 
Disappointing \"Thai\" place. everything just lacked flavor. 

Lesson learned. We won't be going back."}
{"text":"We were driving back from Tucson and just wanted to pick up some Thai take out on our route.  I used yelp to find a restaurant with a good rating along the way.  

Thai Basil seemed to be a good choice so I called the order in.  We had the fresh rolls, Pad Thai and Sautéed Thai Basil Plate.

I was asked how hot to make the entrees out of mild, medium, hot and Thai hot.  I chose hot because we really do like a spicy dish.  

We eat a lot of Thai so the flavors and heat of typical Thai dishes are very familiar.

If we were to eat here again I would have the Thai Basil Plate.  It has a nice Thai basil flavor with a slight sweetness.  Fortunately we have eaten in a number of very good Thai restaurants on our visits to Phoenix and we will not return here.

Both of the entrees were really mild.  There was no heat at all.

The Pad Thai was just not good at all.  It just didn't have much flavor.

The fresh rolls had a good flavor but I would have preferred to have tofu or shrimp in them.  In addition to the typical vegetables they had a crunchy something that we could not identify and there is no description on the menu."}
{"text":"I was introduced to Thai Basil today via co-workers! We picked up food to go, due to working in Phoenix, but spent a few moments observing this small restaurant, that apparently has quite the impact!  Every table was full, and I saw the working crowd lunching, students taking advantage of their leisure days, and probable regulars.  I can see why! Nestled in a corner, steps away from Top Liquors, this place is endeared and slightly off the beaten path!  Parking was an issue, so be aware.

Before I mention the food, I do have to state the atmosphere is very Thai, and it is designed with touches of artistically crafted wood that I felt was imported from Thailand.  the main woman behind the counter was charming, and warm.  Its a fast moving joint during the lunch hour, so grab a menu while you wait in line, and be ready to give your order! I cannot wait to sit down and enjoy the ambiance more!

NOW onto the food, it is brilliant Thai cuisine!  I ordered the Yellow Curry with Chicken at a medium heat.  It was spicy, but nicely so, and was delicious! I am glad to have left overs to enjoy another day! And the spring roll app was a little nugget of goodness, which I didn't know I was receiving.  

They have a few locations throughout the valley, whether you're in Tempe or Chandler, and in the mood for Thai, check them out for sure!"}
{"text":"Great local thai restaurant with some sushi. Friendly service and excellent food. Happened to be around the area around dinner time and was not disappointed! Definitely recommend the Soft shell crab roll and the fried rice."}
{"text":"Great lunch spot.  Quick service and healthy and delicious Thai Food.  I love the Thai Basil chicken."}
{"text":"I go to Thai Basil quite a bit on my lunch break.  This is a great spot to go to if you are looking for a quick and delicious lunch at a good price.  I usually order the Thai Basil (their signature dish) and it is so good every time. There are quite a few Thai places in the area and this one is my favorite.

One suggestion... the place is pretty small.  If you are going at a lunch or dinner rush time I would not go with more than 4 people in a party.  I've seen people come in groups of 6 or 8 when it's busy and it really slows things up.  The Thai Basil on Rural (not far) is quite a bit bigger.  Go there if you are in a large group.  Great food there too!"}
{"text":"We ordered Yom yum chicken and prawn soup and crispy vegetable spring rolls...the spring rolls were amazing and so was the soup ! Only wish the soup portion was larger for the price and only had 2 prawns per soup ....but nonetheless ....the soup was incredible and so were the spring rolls.... we went there near closing time (9:40 pm) and they close at 10 pm...the service was amazing !! They weren't pressuring us to leave and were still very welcoming ...considering we came so late and were the only customers there ....the inside is clean and very beautiful and fancy ....the Waiter said that Sundays after 730 it gets less busy so great tip to know if you looking for a quieter place to go Sunday eve...I'm extremely impressed and Deffinty will go there again !"}
{"text":"I'm not particular on Thai food, however, I was really impressed with the teriyaki chicken with fried rice and brocolli.  Usually, teriyaki has an overwhelming sauce, but I felt their sauce was absolutely perfect and meshed well with the fried rice.  Also, I highly recommend the curry chicken with pineapples.  I felt for the quality of the overall food/beverage, the price was affordable at 7-9 bucks.  If you don't want to dine it, you can always order for carry out.

I'd go back."}
{"text":"Ok when I first stepped inside. My first instinct was to grab an umbrella. lol

The waterfall in the front entrance wayyy too loud -- it's intrusive to the dining experience. It was as if there's a rainstorm happening. 

I looked around the place and there was practically no one in the restaurant at the time about 2pm. So it is the waterfall causing a higher than normal ambient noise. And is probably the reason why Darren S commented about this place being so loud. People have to raise their voices to talk over this thing.


Anyways I got seated and proceeded to peruse the menu.


I decided and ordered a dish and a drink. 

\"Mussa-mun\" Curry Beef Brisket
Beef brisket simmered in Thai curry paste with potatoes, peanuts and onions

Coconut Milk Shake

And 1 steamed rice as my beef brisket didn't come with rice.


Here my take;


the Mussa-mun was indeed a thick, rich , and warm red Thai curry paste, but it's an extremely salty dish with a wickedness of fish sauce that requires a serious liberal tongue brushing afterwards. What it needs imho is some serious dilution.

The peanuts and perhaps the potatoes were roasted before simmering in the pot.  Nice touch and they tasted good.

The one saving item I ordered was the Coconut Milk Shake drink. It provided a nice cooling alternative to the rich salty curry.  I would come back here just for the drink.

So being here once and based on what I ordered.. It was okay.

Later when I got home to finish writing this review I browsed their website and noticed that there is a lunch menu!?!  Thanks a lot for not presenting it. 

I wish they would have been more forthright with it.. Now I think they were just being greedy and gave me the dinner menu to order from. Hmm.."}
{"text":"This is my go-to restaurant every week for take out or for a chill Friday dinner with a pal.  I've been going to this place since my grad school days, and the owner and son already know who I am.  It does feel nice to step into a place that's familiar and warm.  For that, i would give Thai Basil 5 stars.  Top-notch service for reasonably priced food.

The Thai dishes are  flavorful and it's pretty much the only Thai restaurant I go to in the Valley (I get better Thai food at home in Hawaii, but since I'm in AZ for the most part, I had to find a substantial alternative).

The menu items that never disappoint:  Thai iced tea, yellow curry with chicken and pad thai."}
{"text":"This place is fair and I would have given it a 3 stars but when I float my little mousy cursery arrowy deal over the 3rd star it reads \"A-OK\" and I'm not really feelin' that. This place is definitely a lot of effin' hype. Sure the food is not bad (no sparkley magically taste-bud juice inspirings going on though) and the lunch prices seem fair but if you try to lunch there it's really obnoxious and definitely not wheelchair accessible. The place is not set up for relaxed dining. Seems more of a here's your gruel now gimme yo' money and GTFO! please *bow with no eye contact* thank you *bow with no eye contact* kinda place. 

For Thai in Tempe Lemon Grass is so much more tempting and tantalizing and in every terrific kind of way. It's almost like a happy ending tabletop side but you know you have clothes on and are eating food and drinking tea and clean up with warn wash clothe isn't as messy."}
{"text":"I love this place. Good food, authentic and ethnic, quick, nice atmosphere, courteous staff (family). it's my favorite Thai food. I've been to their other stores in Tempe too and it's the same. My favorite is red curry with chicken, medium. I like the green curry too. Eating there is good and take out works well too. OH, the Thai Iced Tea...sugary but I LOVE it! They have a real nice covered patio that's actually not too bad in the summer as well."}
{"text":"Good food and value.  Friendly service from waitresses.  Has parking but the lot is sometimes crowded.  Overall a good place if your hankering Thai."}
{"text":"Thai Basil is alright, not great but alright. I ordered the Pad-see-ew and the weirdest thing is that the noodles were tasty and delicious but all the veggies and chicken were pretty well tasteless. Plus, my medium to hot dish was much more mild to no spice. 

However, my iced Thai coffee was delicious and the service was very friendly, they even went to find me when I stepped out to Tops while waiting. Also, the the prices are very reasonable, my whole meal was less than 10 bucks.

So, ok for now, I'll try some more dishes and hopefully be more excited."}
{"text":"Tried this place couple of times.  Both times good.
Vegeterian fried rice, noodles both good.the best was vegetable rolls . They stuff this mint and tofu.  Different touch when compared to other thai reataurants have tried. Curries also good."}
{"text":"Great food for a reasonable price ~ quick friendly service. 

It's a blessing to have such a nice place within walking distance from my business.  :) KC"}
{"text":"This has been my go to Thai place for almost 7 years. I have tried to be bias by trying other places BUT ALWAYS come back to the best. I usually bring my friends & all of my out of town family here. The atmosphere is really laid back & chill. The owners Jay & Dee are very welcoming. 
I have eaten most things off the menu (except the soup & salads). But my top favorites is the Pad See Ewe, Pad Pik King (with Salmon) & the Yellow Curry. However, all dishes thus far, have been very delicious. 
(This review is for the Thai Basil across from ASU, next door to McDonald's)"}
{"text":"Whenever its the most wonderful time of the year I always get the Pumpkin Curry. This is definitely one of my favorite Thai spots to go to. They can be busy quite often but the wait time is usually short."}
{"text":"One of best place for Thai food  and very nice staff. Only bad thing is they don't have enough space, little cramped. Good place for lunch esp their lunch combos."}
{"text":"This location is way better than the one off of central.  The prices are whats advertised, unlike the location on Central.  
The food at this location is flavorful and the staff is helpful

I have been to this location, and will continue to order from here, but I will never go back to the location on central and Thomas.

This location should serves as a model to the other locations. 

THE ONE ON CENTRAL and THOMAS IS TRASH compared to this one."}
{"text":"Ive been to the Tempe location, and its great, but this one overcharges, or there menus have the wrong price unless tax in phoenix went up at just this location by like 10%.

I also got WAY WAY WAY overcharged for an appetizer, 5 cold crab puffs, and a bowl of wonton soup came out to $20 for lunch. I am never going back to this location, if I ever go back. They honestly lost a regular customer.

And the salad you get is overdressed and it looks like they do not rinse their veggies."}
{"text":"went with a food group and thoroughly enjoyed myself. started with a coconut based soup with shrimp and scallops, with a hint of lime and lemongrass.asked for hot, more medium-hot.  for entrees, i had spicy noodes, again with shrimp and scallops, and it was great. the rest of the group had yellow curry dishes, which i samples and were ok, fried rice which is hard to screw up, and they did not, and sliced beef dish in a tangy sauce, also good. for dessert, i had one of my favorite thai desserts. sticky rice and mango. all in all a good experience, and they also have an outlet in central phoenix on central near thomas. good neighborhood food. wish they had thad mun for an appetizer,. which are fish patties that i enjoy and you can find at thai rama on camelback and 13th ave. otherwise, i recommend this place."}
{"text":"I could enjoy the pad thai but it tastes a bit like ketchup.
Much better than most of the thai places in Toronto though.
Pretty big portions too"}
{"text":"One of the best Thai places near ASU, great service & lunch selection as well."}
{"text":"Fresh, crisp, nice flavors.  Very clean and prompt.  My one complaint is that it is small and feels a bit aloof.  (So, i prefer take-out.)  But really good food."}
{"text":"We came upon this place after leaving Restoran Malaysia because of their lack of credit card/debit card payments. Thai Basil has beautiful decor and the food is good but way overpriced for simple Thai dishes that can be found in greater quantity and at a fraction of the cost. We ordered a two drinks, deep fried calamari which was highlight of our entire meal, basil chicken which arrived in a small platter with 1 shredded chicken breast - enough for two people? Barely. Finally the Bangkok pad Thai with chicken and shrimp which was plenty for two people, good depth with regards to taste but lack lustre in presentation. The dish was bland looking with absolutely no colour - the dish's saving grace was the taste which we'd give 3.5/5."}

Which we thought was very overpriced for such simple dishes. If it wasn't for the price this review would have hit 4.5/5 stars."}
{"text":"One of the top 3 places my wife and I frequent. The bill is usually $20 and the money is worth it. Peanut curry is amazing as well as sweet and sour chicken. We drive about 25 miles to eat here sometimes."}
{"text":"Thai basil once messed up my order by giving me the wrong sauce for the chicken and they wouldn't refund my money for one damn chicken how cheap can you be?  The waitress told me it was going to come out of her money and I said they can't do that to you. It's not fair to the servers but at the same time I'm a paying customer and I didn't get what I ordered so why can I not just get my money back? I feel bad for the servers but at the same time I don't want to hear about her problems.
They said I ate it I said I stopped eating it when I realize that the sauce with some nasty gross thing and not the right size and I'm trying to return it and they wouldn't do it.
They also don't have coconut sticky rice and can you please tell me how a Thai restaurant doesn't offer that?
One time the Penang chicken was a little off it seem like the chicken had a smell to it and wasn't fresh. They also barely include any vegetables with the Penang chicken it's all chicken and no veggies.
The lunch special doesn't taste good either their mango salad really sucks the dressing they put on it is very vinegary and doesn't taste authentic so I wouldn't try to get that either."}
{"text":"Ok to eat here when nothing else is open. Unfortunately I can't recommend their Thai food. It seems to me like a Chinese eatery trying to make Thai food. To end on a positive note. Plenty of parking and it's close."}
{"text":"Known for holding holiday/event specials, this intimate restaurant has a classy atmosphere, but what could seem date-worthy is actually offset by the families it attracts. If not the families, then the noise level. Still, lovely decorum which I know they put a lot into.

Service was good. Pad thai was bland as hell. While it's nothing spectacular, the menu offers a lot of variety and thai dishes."}
{"text":"Thai Basil serves a wide variety of Thai cuisine.  Along with must-have Thai noodle dishes like pad thai and pad see ew, they also have curries, rice dishes and a variety of appetizers such as spring rolls and crab rangoon.   The curry stands out as some of Madison's best, but all of the dishes I've had have been well prepared and quite enjoyable.

I think if Thai Basil when I want some comfort food.  I generally get take out, but have also eaten in their small dining area.  The staff is pleasant and goes out of their way to make sure you're satisfied without being overly attentive.  While they're not going to get a Michelin star any time soon, they do what they do well and with care."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times because their food is usually pretty good. They tend to cram the tables in, so you really have to squeeze (even as a normal size person) to get to the bench seat. And then you're practically on top of the person next to you. You'll also notice the bizarre door that they have at the entrance: it's a sliding door that must be operated manually.
I got the panang curry chicken ($10). They charge extra for rice ($1.50). Presentation and temperature were good, and the portion was adequate. Flavours were good as well, although I will note that the pieces of chicken still had bits of cartilage attached.
I think that the curries are typically rather good here. I'm no fan of their pad thai, as I find it much too saucy and wet. Don't bother ordering their mixed drinks, as they water them down so much that they taste like nothing.
The biggest thing against this place is the service. The waitress this time was quite rude. My friend wanted to get the lunch special. Okay, it was 6:30, but he offered to pay a higher price, but she said \"no exceptions\"--not sure what logic that makes. Anyway, fine, so we ordered our food. And then she brings it and, I guess there's a plate in the way of the dish she wants to put down, and she says \"can you move?\" Apparently, she didn't have much training in waiting tables. At one point there was some eye-rolling coming from her. Her bad attitude continued when neither of us could understand what she was saying--turned out to be \"anything el or that be all?\" (she couldn't be bothered to finish saying the word \"else,\" and so turned it into \"el.\" I believe she was rolling her eyes again when my friend asked to take the rest of his food home.
So I wasn't too pleased with her service, and I made that clear by giving her a far less than average tip ($0.12 to be exact.) Of course, so readers will find this mean of me, but I'll argue that the whole idea of a tip is to reward good service. In this case, her service sucked, along with her attitude. I'm certainly not going to reinforce her behaviour with money. And it's not my fault that waitstaff get paid pennies, and so I refuse to tip simply to supplement their wages.
The problem with these chip and pin card readers is that there's the social pressure of the waitress knowing right away how much tip (if any) you left. Her reaction was priceless. First she thought it was a mistake, but I said, \"no, that's correct.\" She was really fuming now, and said, \"you should at least give 10%.\" Clearly, she's completely unprofessional, and her reaction just confirmed that I had given her the right amount. Waitstaff who think they are entitled to tips shouldn't be given any at all."}
{"text":"I was out in Tempe for work and came here for dinner with 15 of my colleagues. Luckily we called ahead and were able to get a couple of tables next to each other and in the back area. The service- super quick! Our waitress was all about the speed and was always fast to refill a drink or get whatever was needed. I'm not a huge Thai fan and my boss ordered a bunch of random food for the table so I'm not 100% on exactly what I ate but I really enjoyed it- especially the spicy soup- goes great over some white rice."}
{"text":"I went to this place not too long ago. The severs weren't attentive. I practically had to wail my arms to get a refill! The food wasn't that great. I wouldn't go again."}
{"text":"One Statement: Don't get fooled by 4 stars. This place doesn't even deserve one star.

Its rarely happens that we leave behind all the food we ordered. Not sure where to start with. We ordered fried clamari and fried tofi for starters, both starters were bland and lacked any kind of seasoning. Chicken satay was good. Bunch of us ordered fried rice and who the heck puts lettuce in fried rice. Both fried rice and green curry had loads of frozen vegetables not cooked properly. I could taste the ice in the veggies.

They just focus on food quantity and absolutely lacked quality.  I dont even want to comment about the service; the servers were rude and didnt care for us."}
{"text":"Since my first ride on Tempe's Orbit transportation system I saw it. That SIGN that teasing sign... Thai Basil! For months I saw it as I rode by on my way to and from class. For months I wondered what was really going on behind the tinted windows. Was it open? Was it closed? There's no reviews for it on yelp! Could it be... an undiscovered place in the middle of the ASU area?! Can't be!! It must be an fluke! For months I saw the occasional car in the parking lot, but the sign was never lit, never any signs of life... until tonight!!

As I came home from class I saw balloons adrift from Thai Basil's once lifeless rooftop! It's open! It's open! My stars! It's open! I could smell the Lar Nar! SHWEET!!

I considered going there after class to see if it lived up to the hype in my mind but a pesky homework assignment called me home and so I broke out the sweats and fired up the lappie thinking it was going to be loong night when my friend Becca came to my rescue!

We entered the brand spakin' new Thai Basil on the night of their grand opening when I realized that maybe it wasn't going to live up to the hype in my head. We entered and saw a cool looking dining room to the left with coffee tables and pillows for dining on (yay!) and some pretty cool looking booths (yay!), a bar with wine proudly displayed (double yay!) and huge dishes of after dinner mints (triple yay!)  and then we were seated in the corner away from all the fun (boo). They didn't have a wine or drink list eaither. (double boo) Yeah it kind of sucked because I think we were seated by the bathroom but oh well. 

I had their White Zin, sweet but nothing great - it's barefoot. I like barefoot, but still I know there's some wine conossiours out there who'd rather put their foot in their mouth than drink a glass of barefoot. Unfortunatly, my very thirsty friend realized that there weren't ANY mixed drinks there! but there's a bar RIGHT over there!! Hopefully they'll get this straightened out soon otherwise that nice spiffy bar is just a very fancy bottle tray!

On to the food...

Beckita shall be mentioned first as her meal hit the table about a good 8 minutes before mine did! She had the Veggie Delight with Chicken... question: wouldn't that render this dish a Chicken Delight? I'm just saying. It had various veggies, the usual suspects: Carrots, zucchini, green onions, sprouts etc.. I had a bite and it was way too garlickly for my taste. She liked it just fine. I don't think I'd order it but I could see a lot of people enjoying it. 

I had the Rad Nar, which is their version of Lar Nar... wide rice noodles with stir fried carrots, broccoli and beef all swimming in a savory gravy. I ordered mine with extra carrots and hot. I got the carrots but was missing the heat. The beef was a little too tough for my liking. Also, The waitress gave me a dish of red chili flakes and told me to add my own spice. If that was the plan all along then why ask me how hot do I want it? Is this to proportion the chili flakes? 

We skipped dessert, split the check and called it a night. Tableside, we decided that this was a solid 3 stars. The service was decent but not great, the place was clean but wasn't very modern or comfy (well atleast the section we were in) and it just felt like a solid 3 star place. To my yelpers I say: If you're very close by (saaaaay the ASU dorms?) and don't have transportation and MUST have thai food or you'll burst then give Thai Basil a try. Hopefully, they'll work out some of the smaller kinks for you by then!"}
{"text":"Thai Basil is family owned Thai restaurant. We went to this place not really expecting much. And it definitely left us a great first impression,  this hidden Gem definitely deserves a five star rating  . I must admit that I'm big on customer service/interaction. If the food is good but your service is not up to par. I will never go back there. However this place blew us out of the water. Anthony gave us one of the most personable service. He knew it was our first time there. He asked questions. Made recommendations and definitely made us feel welcome, even though it was 1hr before closing. We didn't feel rush and the food was really good. They had more options. But for the first we wanted to try our all time fave dish, Chicken Panang and PorkChop katsu style. Their Thai tea was one of the best I've tried so far. And I've drank a lot of Thai teas in my life. I suggest try this spot you won't regret it. The ambiance of this place makes you feel like your really in Thailand. The decorations and color scheme of the place was well decorated. I highly recommend this place. From what Anthony told us that they've been open for 12 years. That's a long time for a hidden Thai restaurant . Try it and I hope you will love everything about it. #greatservice #thaibasil #thairestaurant #foodie #restaurantreview #customerservice #quality #lasvegas #vegasdining #foodie"}
{"text":"I've been coming to Thai Basil for years and have had nothing but excellent food.  I'm frankly surprised at some of the negative reviews that others have posted. Tasteless? Maybe if you order plain rice it would be, but everything I've ordered has been superb.  For me, the portions are adequate and filling. There's simply is no other Asian cuisine in the area that can compare. I love the Pad Thai, Singapore Noodles, Drunken Noodles, and scallops. They also serve fresh sushi if that's your thing. Staff is friendly and attentive.  Prices are moderate,  but a reasonable person would expect that from quality food. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I come here all the time. I always love getting their Chrystal Noodle Soup with either chicken or beef. The pad thai is also very good as is the pineapple Fried rice with beef. Since I am and always will be a Tempe native this is my go to place for Thai food in Tempe. I try to avoid going with the rush of ASU students but meeting my parents there for lunch (they are ASU professors) is always a good time :)"}
{"text":"I went here for dinner while staying at a nearby hotel for work. Very good place to eat. I had the seafood pad Thai (medium) and the mango sticky rice and it was very tasty, esp the mango sticky rice! 
The seafood dish had good amount of seafood: shrimp, scallops, calamari, and tofu :) the dessert was just perfect! Friendly and attentive staff & nice patio to eat outside too."}
{"text":"Best Thai food I have ever tasted with service from super awesome and friendly employees.  Been going here for over 6 years and have never been disappointed even one time.  I could swim laps in their peanut curry.  So bomb."}
{"text":"Typical Thai restaurant - I went here about a year ago. My friend ordered pineapple friend rice which came in half shelled out pineapple which we thought was neat.  I ordered one of the thai chicken curries with rice.  Ambience is clean and renovated, you can bring a date here."}
{"text":"College meets expat atmosphere, truly great food, excellent service and fun decor. 

-took a friend who never had Thai before, we had: Tom Ka Gai, Sticky rice w Mango, Thai Iced Tea and some yumi chicken vegi thing...it was a success!
I now have a partner in Thai!
Cheers!"}
{"text":"I have written a review for Thai Basil before and I was very pleased.  Tonight...not so much.  First of all we arrived at 5:38pm, early I know, but time was of the essence.  There were 2 other tables of 2 in the restaurant and the hostess tried to seat us smack dab in the middle of both.  An empty restaurant, seriously?!  We asked for another table and were told no, that every table was reserved, really? At 5:30. I insisted on a 2 top by the window. Waited 15 minutes for a drink order and then we were rushed through our ordering process, my apps were cleared before I was finished, we were hovered over through our meal(not service wise...get the hell out of here wise). Needless to say, we didn't order mains and left pissed off.. What was once my go to place is now my no go place..BTW..food was good but for me service needs to be there too."}
{"text":"Excellent excellent excellent that's all I can say I had Thai pad Thai and it was delicious it was the seafood one there was lots of different seafood amount was great I thought it was expensive at first but then I looked at the amount and I said that's fair so it's definitely the best place in Arizona to eat I love Thai basil"}
{"text":"First and Last time eating here.

I ordered a takeout order that was said to take 15-20 minutes.  I showed up about 20 minutes after I placed my order.  I had very quick service when it came to ringing me up and paying.  Then I waited, thinking my food would be ready soon.  
In total it took about 50 minutes from the time I ordered to get my food.  While I was waiting I was not recognized by any of the staff, only in the way as far as I could tell.  The one very disturbing thing I did see that, more than just the general uncleanliness of the restaurant, would make me not go back, was that one of the waiters (who appeared to be the manager), came out of the kitchen with an entrée he was about to take to one of the tables, grabbed a fork from over where the dirty dishes were (I only hope the fork he took was from a clean pile, b/c they had been putting dirty dishes in that area since I got there), and scraped off parts of the noodle dish into the trash before taking that plate to one of the tables.

The food itself was on par in my opinion with Little Dumplings and several of the other local thai places I have visited in the area as far as the Pad Thai is concerned (had 7 star spicy).  I only hope this was a one time incident b/c that was the first time I had ever seen anything like that happen in a restaurant (though other restaurants may do the same, but I had never seen that before).

I hope I just visited them in an off night, but there are enough other places in the area I could go that I will not be going back to Thai Basil."}
{"text":"Fantastic food!  Love the Medium yellow curry chicken!  I can get over the marginal service for addictive good food.  What do you expect from a little mom and pop?  C'mon people get over it!  I love this place!"}
{"text":"What a disappointment! We went in hoping for some REAL authentic Thai food, not the modified fusion version to fit western taste. There is nothing unique about the menu (may be dessert menu could be better but by the end of the meal, we were so disappointed, we didn't even want to stay and try it out). 'Eggplant and pork hotpot'?? That's Chinese!! 'Stir fried Vermicelli Singapore Style'??!! Come on people, there's NO SUCH THING!! ask anyone from Singapore and they will tell you there's no such dish in Singapore! My friend had the 'Pad Thai', it tasted just fine, like any other Thai restaurants, except the shrimp wasn't fresh and he had upset stomach after wards. 

However, there is one good thing I'd like to say about the place, like many others have reviewed, the price is relatively reasonable for its location and the restaurant is nicely renovated. If you are looking for a nice place that serves good food (mind you not authentic), I'd say go for it. Just don't get your hope too high like we did, or you will be disappointed... Well at least I know one thing, I'm out of there, Ciao!"}
{"text":"I was going to eat here and decided to look them up on the computer........low and behold, they were on \"Dirty Dining\"......Yuck !!!  Yuck !!!   won't be trying this place.  With all these good reviews, hope nobody got food poisoning......"}
{"text":"First time here and had a great experience with the food and service. I ordered the Thai Basil Chicken and asked for the mild basil sauce instead of the spicy. It had a really nice flavor. It came with rice and a vegetable roll. The lady was really nice and went over to our table a couple of times to see how the food is and if we needed anything else. Definitely coming back here again! We were here during lunch time, maybe we'll try dinner next time."}
{"text":"I've been to Thai Basil several times over the past few years and the service and definitely the food is very inconsistent.  I understand they are in a difficult location but that does not mean they can lack on the food quality or service."}
{"text":"Good selection and excellent food.  Friendly waitstaff.  The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because of difficulty communicating what \"hot\" means.  American hot or Thai medium means that I want to sweat when I eat."}
{"text":"I eat Thai 3 or 4 days a week.  I generally spend at least one of those days at Thai Basil.  It's a really great spot for a quick lunch because they are FAST.  There's a good selection of lunch special items.  All the food is fresh, hot, and tasty.  The appetizer salad that they serve has a dressing that makes my life worth living."}
{"text":"I got the red curry. It was delicious! I got the extra hot and it was perfect. The lunch specials were well priced and good portions. I'll be coming back"}
{"text":"If you love the Tempe location, be advised that the food is different here. The University store is magical and delicious, but the Central location is so-so. Panang tofu is usually my go to, but it's not very good here. I would highly recommend the cashew tofu with a big glass of Thai iced coffee, though."}
{"text":"My favorite Thai place. Fair prices, massive servings (I usually get the pad Thai noodle with tofu), and especially their Thai tea... Mmmm. You can even choose the \"level\" of spice u want in your dish. Recommend!"}
{"text":"Came here to meet some friends for dinner on a trip to Phoenix.  The hot and sour soup here is perhaps one of the best I have had.  the rest of the fare was decent and I would claim is average."}
{"text":"This is off the beaten path.....But, The sesame chicken and kung pao chicken are obscenely good. The prices are fantastic..."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. I've honestly never had Thai food this good (though admittedly I've only eaten Thai food a few places in Phoenix and in San Francisco).  Their Pad See Ew is amazing and their curry is awesome as well. This is actually the only place where I can even eat the curry (all other curry I've tried has been disgusting), so it's possible they make it slightly differently.

Their prices have gone up slightly in the past few years, but it is still very reasonable money-wise. Overall one of Tempe's best restaurants, I'd say."}
{"text":"This is the closest Thai food to home... I ordered out & got Panang Curry. It wasn't too bad compared to other places. I'd definitely come back again."}
{"text":"I've been coming to Thai Basil for a couple of years and have been searching Tempe for good thai food. This place is awesome. It's right across the street from my dorm, and their food is cooked to order. They are super accommodating to people's tastes and very nice. You can come in for dinner with a huge party and they will do their best to fit you all together. Their dessert of sticky rice is great, the pad thai comes in a huge portion and is fairly priced, the lunch specials are great. I would say this is one of my favorites in Tempe. Being Asian I like eating some genuine Asian food from time to time and this place is great! Their thai tea is awesome enough for me to stop by during the day and grab two for myself."}
{"text":"Love their duck curry! It was a little busy when we went but that is a good thing! It's hard to find good curry in Tempe, so I was a little bit leery of trying it, but it was one of the best I've had in a while. I must say the left overs the next day were even better! Will  definitely have to go back."}
{"text":"I don''t give many 5 stars.
This place deserves for flavor, service and fair lunch special pricing.
Hot, fresh flavor explosion.
I love tom-kha and red curry, and this place has delicious examples.
I recommend the red curry #29... make it Thai hot for a perfect kick, that's how I like it --- but I heard double Thai hot might be too hot for some people.
Service is quick even when busy, and you can be in and out in 30 mins if you chow down! HOW, you may ask, when the food is so piping hot?
Well it comes with rice, and you fish out some major chunks and lay them on the rice, blow to cool. You can spoon the sauce when that cools in 20 mins. In and out in UNDER 30 mins, I've done it.
I haven't sampled the menu extensively, but I think you'll be happy!
Outdoor seating for cooler temps.
This is one of the hidden gems for the Phoenix area, I hope you think it's worthy like I do."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good! I like going here for lunch because they offer great lunch specials at a reasonable price. I really like their Cashew Nut Chicken. At night time, they offer a nice and cozy atmosphere that is good for couples and friends."}
{"text":"Great red curry here with the appropriate level of heat.

Oh a whim, I decided to order some red curry with tofu ($8.95) to go. I feel that a curry forms a good baseline judgement of an establishment, much as a simple hamburger does for most pubs.\"If you can't cook a simple burger...\" as the saying goes.

Well, mine is if they can't make a flavorful curry with the right heat and consistency, then the other dishes are unlikely to perform any better.

It was a hit! Great, silky consistency, without being runny like soup. Each spoonful of this potent curry delivered bites of bamboo shoots, green or red peppers, and soft, fried tofu. I ordered level 4 out of 5 and enjoyed a good sweat, so they are not playing around with an ambiguous rating scale of 1 to 1000, be aware when you choose your spice level!

I really liked that the tofu in the curry was firm yest still spongy, unlike some restaurants that prepare their fried tofu and end up with rough, tough edges. These morsels were lightly fried just enough to maintain their shape but still able to absorb some of the curry, giving it some flavor.

They don't offer papaya salad here, which is disappointing. The one pictured in my photo is leftover from another place, sorry to be a tease :oP

If you are in the mood for some piquant Thai food, stop here for some curry, they are open 7 days a week and have weekday lunch specials from 11 am until 2 pm!"}
{"text":"Lunch time 11-3 pm mon through sat is more wallet friendly.

Whenever I go up to ASU to visit my sisters, Thai Basil is the first thing we all agreed about for lunch. Not only, as stated above, is this lunch time friendly, their curry is super yummy. Their lunch portion is smaller than dinners but it is just right. Steamed rice with your choices of curries and meats. They have shrimp, tofu, vegetables, beef, chicken, pork and seafood. So many options, right? I simply can't choose so I always get seafood and steal some chicken or veggies off my sisters' plates. Of course, this meal is not complete if you simply order water. You have got to try their Thai Iced Tea; you can share this because it does get overwhelming after awhile with the curries. The other nice option is to have hot tea which warms you up and cleanses your palate after a bite of curry."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. Ordered chicken Pad Thai to go and I didn't notice until I got home that they put tofu instead of chicken. The flavor was very plain, there wasn't even peanuts in it. Don't recommend."}
{"text":"Thai Basil is my go-to carry-out Thai place. I love the green curry. Mmmm. Green Curry.....
The staff is very friendly. They don't just say trite things when they talk to you. They are definitely interested in getting to know their patrons. That makes a big difference to me!
The food is always, always fresh. I love how the carrots are scalloped, and obviously never frozen. Fresh green beans, jiminey, I could go on and on!
You can't go wrong here. It is a chain restaurant, but the owners have made it their own. I love to go here. 
Can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"Excellent. Pad Thai with tofu was wonderful, lots of tofu! Got order to go and when I got it back to my vaca home it was still hot!
Fresh and tasty...."}
{"text":"On one of my first nights in Toronto I decided to go here on a whim after wandering down Bloor St. The decor and ambiance is very warm and relaxing. The staff are friendly and welcoming. 

I tried the yellow curry chicken which was really tasty, but very filling. I could not finish it all so I left about half the bowl untouched. When the server came to take it away she gave me a funny look and asked me if I didn't like the food. I said yes I liked it but I was just full, so she continues to intrude and ask if I want to take it to go. I say no (because I was going out after and I wasn't about to carry around some curry with me). She then looks offended and wonders again if I was unhappy with the food. Um, so anyone deciding to eat here please make sure you finish alllll your food or else you'll practically get scolded by the staff. Needless to say, it made me feel a bit awkward.

However, overall I did enjoy this place. Location is great, food was good, as well as the atmosphere."}
{"text":"The bbq pork was excellent! 

I called in a take out order and I thought I ordered the dinner portion of bbq pork, but I ended up getting the rice and a fried spring roll combo. I don't care for fried food and I avoid eating a lot of rice, but I'm sure they tasted fine. I cannot complain about the food. I  was a little sad I didn't get what I ordered. I will try to be more specific next time I call in. I'm sure they would be happy to give me more yummy meat for more money. I am looking forward to a day when my diet permits me to order their green curry.

Go eat here!"}
{"text":"Nice and close to the ASU campus.  Fairly easy to find parking and doesn't seem to be too busy. 

Seating/decor
Can accommodate groups but will probably need to call in advance for reservations.  Decor is nice and we'll kept.  Some tables with booth type seating.  Dark wood tables and chairs.  Hard wood floor.

Service
Wait staff was very attentive and frequently made sure our glasses were filled and that we had everything we needed to make the experience great

Food:
Go to try the Green Coconut Curry with Avocado and the House Fried Rice along with the Pad Thai.  Food was well seasoned and portions fair for the price. Wished I had tried the more spicy version of the curry and look forward to repeat visits to check out more of the menu."}
{"text":"Food was mediocre. Service was mediocre. Nothing special about this place but they still got 4 stars?"}
{"text":"The food was OK, generic tasting Pad Thai that was more red and ketchupy than I like, spring rolls were cold and the golden/yellow thai chicken curry was tasty but not served hot. Staff serving skills were more indicative of the sushi places found in the area. The soup served with the lunch special was tasty and probably the highlight of the meal. Will likely not dine here again."}
{"text":"Reasonable price considering the portions. Food was good but not amazing. Will be back :)"}
{"text":"It's good!  A trustworthy place.  You can count on it. :)"}
{"text":"OK, I'll get the bad stuff out of the way first. 

Thai Basil is pretty decent Thai food, but it gets frustrating when each time you go, the story is always the same: a really long wait for any food to appear on your table.

Considering it's not a fancy, hoity toity sit down place, this is a little unusual. Even soups and satays take around 25-30 minutes. There may be only one cook doing everything the back kitchen, but they need to sort this out because at least something to munch on (appetizer/soup) should appear in front of you within 15 minutes of giving your order. 

That said, now the good stuff. 

The food is pretty decent. Not amazing Thai, but not mediocre either. And when you ask for the food to be spicy, they don't just nod their heads and then ignore your request. They'll routinely make it spicy to order. I've had their special Thai Basil Chicken, as well as the red, yellow, green, and masaman curries - and they've all got good flavor. Service is friendly, and waters will constantly be refilled, and if it wasn't for the food taking forever each and every time, I'd give the service a really high rating. 

The restaurant itself is clean and not too big (strip mall setting), and you've got your Tempe undergrad/grad student/older folks mix of patrons about.

All in all, I'd give the food somewhere between 3.5 to 4 stars, but the wait is what holds the overall rating back at 3, unfortunately. I'd definitely recommend their food if you're in the Tempe area, as again it is decent Thai, but either order it to go or be in the mindset for a very leisurely lunch or dinner (ie. come up with some good conversation topics with your companions)."}
{"text":"You know that song \"Suddenly\" by Billy Ocean? What, you claim you don't remember? You're cool now, but I know you've heard people dedicate it at least 100 times on Casey's American Top 40. But by chance you partied too hard in college and have forgotten an entire decade, here's a reminder: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWaqauMk5ts. 

Why am I going through all this trouble for an intro? It's because this Central Avenue location of Thai Basil is the \"Suddenly\" of Phoenix Thai food. 

Except it's the Kenny G sax version, so there's no lyrics. Which means there's no \"wake up, suddenly....you're in love\" gush of emotions when it comes to experiencing this establishment. Instead, it's a giant bowl of dentist waiting room lite jazz; too milquetoast even for Blaise Lantana.

For it was this song, \"Suddenly\", that played along as I ate some extremely bland beef Masuman curry a few nights ago. None of the requested heat, and none of the expected rich flavor. All I could think of was the color beige.  I mean, who gets bored with Thai food? 

And then, as I ate, a new song. The muzak version of \"Set The Night To Music.\" 

Great.

Which, ok, this all could be chalked up to the fact that Thai Basil may have had an off night. Except this is my 5th time eating here, mostly due to the fact that it's the closest Thai place to me (ok, the other joints are barely any further away, but anyway). And each time the food served to me, whether for lunch or for dinner, is equally bland, no matter how I request it and no matter which dish I get - curries, sauteed dishes, noodles, whatever. 

Service is a little hard to come by at times, usually because the servers are busy bantering amongst themselves or huddled around a laptop. But they're very friendly and professional when they do come to your table, the place is very clean with additional outdoor seating, and the prices are very reasonable, so there's that.

I just get the feeling that this place is a little lazy when it comes to putting much effort into its food. It's like a paint-by-numbers Thai joint, which would be fine, except there are now what, 4 other Thai restaurants within 3 miles of this location? You've gotta step up your game here.

All in all, I'm usually not one to equate Thai food with Billy Ocean balladeering, but I will make an exception here. The food, like \"Suddenly\", is not bad or horrific. It's just dull and not very exciting. 

But hey, chin up Thai Basil. In the grand glass-is-half-full scheme of things, at least you're not \"There'll Be Sad Songs (To Make You Cry)\" played on a Casio keyboard. 

Always a silver lining.

2.49 stars."}
{"text":"I really love this place.  The lunch special chicken pad Thai and the Massaman Curry are awesome, as is the black sticky mango rice.  I would recommend a spice level 5.  The place is small and gets real busy in the lunch crowd hours.  The Massaman is very creamy, not the crappy broth texture that some places have."}
{"text":"How can this be a Thai restuarant? Their pad Thai is terrible.

It's super sweet, defiantly ketchup based (fake way to make pad Thai) 
You can go to Thai express and get better Thai food! 

Their spring rolls are good though

After this experience I won't return to try anything else."}
{"text":"Thai Basil was a pretty good experience overall for a late lunch. The prices were reasonable/affordable, and the Lunch Special came with Tom Yum Soup, a Spring Roll, and an Entree. The Tom Yum Soup was very flavourful, and I really liked the broth but it also tasted a bit \"metal-ish\". Our entrees were the Cashew Tofu and Pad Kee Mao, and both were reasonably good and filling, but not overly astounding. However, the Pad Kee Mao packed a good amount of spice, which hit the spot!"}
{"text":"I LOVE Thai Basil!!!! Staff is very friendly we are repeat customers and always recognize us.... I love that! I have tried almost everything on the menu and there is not ONE dish I do not like.  That never happens... EVER!!  The only issues I have with this establishment which are not communicated at all; the food comes out at seperate times, sometimes u r waiting while the rest of your table has their dinner, also the staff is really really really slow.  But that has not deterred me from the amazing food!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice for the pad Thai and both times it has been amazing. I'm looking forward to trying some other dishes. They have spice levels 1- 5 for their dishes and it is not a dine-in restaurant, but they pack the food well and it reheats well the next day."}
{"text":"Delicious and prompt service. I ordered the Pad-See-Ew(sp) as carry-out after walking in intending to stay but I ordered to-go instead. The hostess was super friendly and the shop was very pretty and well-kempt. The only reason I didn't provide five stars is because the sauce on my dish was a little bland, but I will still definitely be back to enjoy more options."}
{"text":"This place leaves a lot to be desired for me.There is a lot of Thai places to choose from in the Valley. They certainly do not need my business. But, I feel I have no reason to ever come back here. I really wanted to try the one on University. But, since I was driving down Rural, I thought I would give it a try. It was about 1:30 so the lunch rush was over. 
The lot has lots of parking, and the place is clean and well decorated inside. The ladies room is clean also.
The thing is ,when I came in there was only two other tables other than me. The first table was just getting up to leave. So then there was just 2 of us. My server cleaned every dirty table in the place until she came to take my order. I ordered the Yellow Curry with shrimp. 
While it was good , I feel that it was the Sweet Yellow Curry. Which is good , but I wanted the Spicy Yellow Curry.
I happened to hear the man at the other table tell them they gave him the wrong tea. He wanted Green tea and was given something else. I wanted Jasmine Tea and was given the correct Tea. 
No one ever came back to my table the entire time I was there to see if I needed a refill, to check on my food, or bring me the check.
I finally had to as a male server for my check. The food was good , but customer service is not. 
They are located in the middle of ASU so they have plenty of Business. So I know that is why they probably really don't care about one person stopping in for lunch.
But, I know I won't return."}
{"text":"Yelp, I feel a little let down.  Solid 4-star reviews, and I was expecting a really great meal.  Not that Thai Basil is terrible, but there are better options in Phoenix.  The Tom Kha soup was good, and the drunken noodles were good, and the yellow curry were good, but just not *amazing*.  My recommendation for Thai in Phoenix is Yupha's Thai Kitchen instead."}
{"text":"This location is so much better than all of the others - the food is great, the staff works quickly and is very friendly! I would recommend the drunken noodles and the chicken eggplant! I always order for pick up because the restaurant itself is very small."}
{"text":"Nothing extraordinary here.  Service was good and food came out quickly.  Portion sizes were alright for dinner and the prices aren't all that bad (or great).  Food was alright, not great, not bad.  I had the Thai Basil and wife had a cashew dish.

The hunt for a good Thai restaurant in Phoenix continues."}
{"text":"The hotel I was staying at had it on its list of recommended restaurant.  When we got there the staff was very friendly. I had the pad Thai with chicken.  A homemade sauce is used to prepare the dish unlike other Thai restaurants that use a pre-made bottled sauce.  Everything was delicious.  The place was clean the prices were fair.  The decor was nice.  I would definitely recommend giving this place a try.  I saw a few other dishes like the curry and the papaya, both looked very delicious.   The Tom yum soup was also very delicious."}
{"text":"I was expecting the typical \"even bad Thai food is pretty good\" meal, and was pleasantly surprised. Really good food for really cheap. Hopefully they get their liquor license soon so I can have a nice cold Phuket with my meal next time."}
{"text":"Great dinner spot in Tempe. I've always had good food and good service here. The red and green curry are both delicious. I usually get the curry dishes with chicken, which is always good. The vegetables are very fresh and pair excellently with the curry sauces. I recommend either the thai tea or the chai green tea to go with your meal"}
{"text":"Staff are very kind but the food was below par and I could tell the ingredients were not fresh. I ordered the pad Thai and spring rolls. The pad Thai lacked flavour, as if they didn't add enough sauce and the shrimp was cold inside when I bit into it. I really wanted to like this place."}
{"text":"Good food but they upped the minimum for delivery to $20. I realize that they are a small company but get real! $20 is far too much to charge for delivery"}
{"text":"First time I got take out the coconut soup was outstanding. So was the sticky rice with mango. The new week I ordered again and the soup was a disappointment. Rice with mango was still great. Think I'll check out other options before going back."}
{"text":"I have always liked this restaurant,  the best Thai in the valley to me, having tried many, including 2 other Thai Basil's, which are not the same, different owners!

Sadly this time while I was waiting for my food I looked up and the older man, who I think is the owner as he mainly handles the cash register,  was wiping his nose on a handkerchief from his shirt pocket- not a tissue so you know where it went when he was done. He was wiping and picking ng and wiping and digging and wiping and then... wipe and finally,  back in the shirt pocket! This is in full view of the dining area behind the bar, didn't even turn his back, gag!
Then, did he wash his hands? Did he use sanitizer? No! He did stack some plates at the pass thru though! Holy Boogers Batman, it doesn't matter how much I like the food, I am never going back since I cannot be sure proper hygiene practices are followed.  Sad day! #maricopahealthdepartment #gross"}
{"text":"Food is bland, almost like they are trying to sparingly use spices. I guess someone who likes bland food would like it here. We ordered pineapple curry, pad Thai, drunken noodle and spring rolls. Overall bland. Service was extremely slow. Waiting 20 min to get plates to go. Lastly I got BIT by something on my FACE as we were waiting for the check! So douse yourself in bug spray before you come. I didn't see it but most likely it was a spider of some sort. Table of new guests gave up after 15 min of waiting to put in drink order."}
{"text":"One of the best Thai food I've ever tried. Thai basil(dish) is very flavorful and fresh, with the choice of heat(hot or medium is enough, Thai hot is too hot for me). Tried seafood and beef, both are good though I prefer seafood more. Bamboo shots and scallops are tasted extremely great! Dish is not too sweet and the taste of basil is not overwhelming. Service are quick during lunch time. Would definitely comeback."}
{"text":"The ONLY negative thing about this place is that it's in Tempe and I live in Peoria :( I have been going to this Thai Basil before YELP was around. I LOVE this place. The owner is a sweet woman who takes pride in her food. I always get the Peanut curry (Panang) but I have tried all their food. The flavors are always on point even though I can't handle spice they accommodate my wimpiness. Lol. Give this place a try. You'll love it."}
{"text":"Another Friday spent here after a hectic week of teaching. Food as always was fabulous, beers cold as ice and a totally relaxed environment. I love this place. No rush to eat and run just a great place! Can't get enough!"}
{"text":"Seriously, I love this place! They have gotten better on their cooked veggies, and I now just get the yellow curry (leave out the pineapple) b/c I'm lazy. Communication is good with a new front man. Delivery time is very extreme hit or miss - so I just pick up now.

Ps. My curry and rice reheats just right for second day approval!"}
{"text":"Great texture and consistency in their curry here. Smooth, creamy, warm. Provided in new lunchware to keep on hand. I have had the fresh spring rolls, which are on par with similar primarily take out restaurants around. Their red curry is comforting, as described above. The evil jungle noodle is simply the red curry with noodle, and although this was good, I was hoping there would be more to our than that. The noodles absorbed the curry so there wasn't much liquid to it. Their tofu is perfectly chewy and actually cut in appropriate sizes. I had mixed experiences with the seemingly frozen veggies, some perfectly cooked and others still very crunchy. Next on my wishlist here are some of the noodle dishes."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner tonight with my hubby.  We are from Las Vegas visiting family for the holidays. After eating left over foods, my husband and I craved for something different.  It was quite hard to find a restaurant that is still open at 9:30pm.  Luckily, I found Thai Basil in Yelp and called them.  Although they closed at 10pm, we did not feel rushed at all.  We got there at 9:54pm and the lady that waited us still had a smile on her face and asked for our order politely.  That is where the extra star is from.

We ordered Tofu Panang, Tom Kha and BBQ Chicken.  I was a little disappointed with my tofu panang as it did not have enough tofu in it and the tofu was not fried.  The Tom Kha was ok nothing special to it.  I've had better.  The Jasmine tea was excellent, perfect for the cold weather.  The chicken BBQ was the most disappointing of all.  For $10, they served 3 small pieces of chicken breast on a bed of a bunch of cabbage with sweet chili sauce.  My husband was so disappointed!!  The taste was ok nothing special but if I knew that we are only getting 3 small pieces for 10 bucks, we wouldn't have ordered it.  Their thai tea was good according to my husband.

The 3 stars is definitely for the service and the late night availability.  The food is not all that and they are quite pricey for the amount of food that they are serving.  If we ever go back, we will definitely not order the bbq chicken and tofu panang.  I think I will try different place before I come back here."}
{"text":"Eh! Taste fresh for take out, I guess. I ordered the Spicy Basil with Beef. The sauce was spicy, and the vegetables were fresh, well-prepared, and plentiful. A little too plentiful. I only had a small portion of beef in my meal so I won't be returning. :-("}
{"text":"The deep fried items were made very well. Perfectly crispy.  We tried 5 entrees to share. My favorite was the red curry, mild, which was perfect for us.  A nice blend of sweet and heat, but not overpowering. Nicely done.  Small place.  Not noisey, even when busy.  Take out busy. Looks locally owned.  No alcohol on menu, which I think is a plus because such places have to really focus on food.  May be more than one location."}
{"text":"FOOD
Lived in the area for the longest time and never gotten the chance to try this hidden gem. Finally have the chance to try this place and wow, it was good. Came here for lunch where we had the lunch special deal - which makes up for our first visit.

Lunch Special:
Small soup (a bit too salty) 
Spring roll w/ sweet and sour sauce on the side

Order:
Chicken Pad Thai
Yellow Curry Chicken
Mixed Fruit Drink Special

Both dishes were very good - my husband approved of the pad thai he ordered. The mixed fruit drink tastes really fresh - was a special for Easter Monday ($4 as oppose to $4.95?). The only thing I'd like to add is the potato in the yellow curry dish. It wasn't cooked long enough. If they cooked it longer, it would've melt in your mouth like heaven.The portions were a decent size for a hungry person. I couldn't finish my curry dish and had to take it home with us - was only half way. 

SERVICE
Great service, all the staff were friendly. All the food you ordered comes out together at the same time. 

KIDS
Not so great for bringing your babies with you. We have twins and it won't fit our double side ny side stroller as it would take up the 90% of the walkway. Bringing a stroller is probably not a good idea for parents. They do have high chairs and booster seats for kids but better off coming with older kids.

PARKING
Great restaurants in the same plaza but limited parking space available. We got here around 1:30PM and we were lucky to find a parking close."}
{"text":"Well I love Thai basil been to all their locations. This location sucks. I called and asked what the lunch special was. I was told one plate only, which was the green curry avocado. When I got there, there was more stuff on the lunch special. She gave me the most expensive over the phone & didn't care  to explain the rest when I first called. Then I question her about the sign that's outside the restaurant that says lunch special $6.95.  She had an attitude with me and didn't seem to care on what I was telling her. She took my food & gave me the regular curry. Very confusing. Won't be coming back to this location."}
{"text":"I wasn't really Into thai food until I came here. Now I love it! Every time I have gone in I've tried something different and so far there is nothing I haven't liked. The staff is always super nice and helpful with the menu. They also give you the decision to make your meal as spicy or as mild as you'd like."}
{"text":"Stopped by for some take-out and thought the restaurant was cozy and cute! My food however was mediocre. I ordered the veggie delight with some brown rice. It was not very tasty and sort of bland. My fiancé ordered the red curry, which was good. The portions are pretty decent, prices are average, but the customer service was great! If I do return I will definitely order something other than the veggie delight."}
{"text":"Ordered pad thai chicken med spicy.  The portions are too big could have easily split it.  Cut the portions down and reduce the price.  It was dry and really spicy for medium.  Also the noodles tasted like they were cooked in tap water, had a weird taste.  Disappointed for sure.  I will not go back.  Quality over quantity please!  This place is all about big mediocre portions."}
{"text":"It's a chain, so... honestly not the best Thai food I've ever had, but great for my boyfriend's first time! The food was pretty solid, the spicy-levels were appropriate, and the service was AWESOME! The food came out quickly and with a smile. It was a great dinner with friends, and I'm happy we went."}
{"text":"Got the saddest looking coconut soup I've ever seen. Wife said it tasted good but i was so depressed i didn't eat it at all because it was just watered down coconut milk with some cheap mushrooms tossed in raw and a few spices. Oh was i so sad because i was looking forward to good thai. Fresh rolls were ok. Not amazing just your standard run of the mill fresh roll with some peanut sauce made probably from jiffy peanut butter which btw is not a good thing. Never going back."}
{"text":"Disappointing experience. Ordered from GrubHub a Super Spicy Papaya Salad and a Chicken Fried Rice. The Chicken Fried Rice was delicious but the Super Spicy Papaya Salad was not even spicy at all, and the portion of papaya in the \"papaya salad\" was so small compared to the other items in the container - lettuce, tomatoes, nuts, green beans, and shrimp. I am not someone who regularly eats spicy food but once in a while I like to try something spicy. I was bracing myself for a spicy salad that turned out to be mild. I complained to GrubHub and was told this restaurant will not refund the salad, and that per the restaurant they included hot sauce in the bag. The only thing in the bag I received were two order plates, napkins, and plastic forks, no hot sauce. Never ordering from this place again. Seems to be run by idiots."}
{"text":"First time here and I was very impressed. Started off with an appetizer, pot stickers, very light and fresh, tasted wonderful too! Went with BBQ pork and it was awesome. Wife had chicken pad see eiw and it was spicy and very good. Did not have room for dessert but will be back soon. A very nice lady gave us great service as well. All in all a very nice dining experience."}
{"text":"I love the University location. It's nice and snug and always full.  They have great variety of food and it always tastes great!  I crave i pretty often.  I will miss it when i move to California.  My favorite dish is the beef Thai Basil signature dish.  They have great lunch specials and everyone that works there is always very nice.  Never any complaints from me."}
{"text":"Just a follow up review to say that my first experience here was no fluke. Came back and had their insanely delicious red curry and more of their yummy pad thai. When it comes to Thai food, this place is heaven on Earth and my current choice for the best  restaurant in Tempe."}
{"text":"The bbq chicken w/peanut sauce is fantastic! I tend to stick to foods at restaurants I like, so I haven't had a chance to try anything else there yet ... but I like this location.  Haven't tried any other location as of yet"}
{"text":"I walked in because I have a thing for Thai iced tea but I was pleasantly surprised with this dish, Khao Soi, fried crispy egg noodles, sitting in a really creamy curry broth...on the spicy side but does not burn the palette.  Definitely a good foodie find!"}
{"text":"Went in to order take out last week and got home only to find one of the meals was wrong. It very much took away from the entire experience.  Wrong dish and too spicy to eat.  Since going back was not an option it left one person with no food they could eat. 
Disappointing."}
{"text":"I almost licked my plate. 

Seriously.

When I saw that a Thai restaurant had gone in at Park Central where a greasy, fast-foodish Chinese place had once been, I immediately was turned off. However, when I realized it was Thai Basil, the same Thai Basil in Tempe, I was excited. 

Yesterday my friend Lisa and I went to Thai Basil for lunch (with cutesy rugrat Olivia in tow as well!). I ordered my usual favorite - Panang Curry with Beef. Lisa also ordered the Panang but with chicken.

I already mentioned - I almost licked my plate - so clearly you know what I thought of my meal. I liked that they brought us a salad when we sat down, but I didn't think it was super-fabulous.

We sat outside and enjoyed the lovely weather. We were served quickly and catered to as we desired. 

Lisa wished her Panang was spicier, but mine was just right. 

Can't wait to go back again!"}
{"text":"I'm new to the area and have been trying to find a good Thai place....tried so many others and was disappointed.  This place is perfect!  The food is fantastic!"}
{"text":"Cheap! The lunch special is such a good deal. My one complaint (and I got there A LOT) is that sometimes the chicken isn't the best quality. Other than that I definitely recommend this resto, especially for lunch special (which is 11:30-5)!"}
{"text":"Really good food!  I was pleasantly surprised!  Do I have a rival to my coveted Thai Spices????  One more visit to decide!"}
{"text":"I was quite surprised at the tastiness of their sushi rolls since this is a Thai place. I would definitely recommended their curry soft shell crab; that was my favorite."}
{"text":"Customer Service has drastically improved. Food is still great...love that Bento Box, Sushi, & Mongolian Beef."}
{"text":"Tried Thai Basil for the first time Sunday.  It was amazing.. I ordered the Siamese Chowmein with a side of peanut sauce, (I don't what is in the peanut sauce exactly I only know it tastes like world peace).  My chowmein was delish and my friend's food was also tasty.

Be good to yourself and try Thai Basil."}
{"text":"This place is so delicious. Great for people who appreciate good plant based flavor with really good spices."}
{"text":"I really liked the service and the food is really great for the price. I come back often because of the exceptional quality. Definitely recommend for anyone not familiar or that wants to take a first dive at Thai food."}
{"text":"It was moderately good and it was cheap! I had enough for two meals! Will be back! 
I got their yellow curry and really enjoyed the lemongrass aroma!"}
{"text":"Delicious pad see ew and yellow curry! All locations are consistently good, too. Real food in a ramen-filled (student food!) neighborhood"}
{"text":"Solid lunch experience and I would return. 

Food
For $10.99 I got a tom-yum soup and spring roll for an appetizer and the green curry with chicken. Good sized portions and decent flavour, I ended up taking a doggie bag with me. The food is not overly greasy or salty like many Thai places. 

Service
Was friendly but a tad slow, but did not take away from enjoying my experience at Thai Basil."}
{"text":"Taste: I ordered off of their lunch menu which is available from 11:30 to 5:00. The lunch combo comes with a Tom Yum Thai Hot & Spicy Soup which was flavourless and was not Tom Yummy at all. It also comes with a Vegetarian Spring Roll which was nothing special. For the dish, I had the Mussamun Curry Beef Brisket. This I thought was great because the beef brisket was nice and tender, and I really enjoyed the peanut flavour of the curry. 

Service: The service was good. Nothing bad happened, and nothing exceptionally good happened.

Value: I think that the prices are really good here, even though part of my lunch wasn't so great. The whole combo was $9.95 which is super affordable for a decent Thai lunch.

Ambiance: Nice Thai themed decor and a lot of table room."}
{"text":"Not much to choose from on the menu. Food didn't look appealing and fried rice was cold."}
{"text":"Horrible service. We had a party of 6 and one entree came out 20 minutes later than the rest. 
We had to ask about it and then waited for another 15 minutes before our last entree arrived. 5 of us finished our dinner before our last guest got his food! Servers were not apologetic at all. The restaurant wasn't busy at the time either. Very bad customer service.  
Food is not as good as the other Thai basils around the valley. Worst Thai Basil we've been too. Will NEVER be back again."}
{"text":"They ripped us off during lunch. 

Our group ordered the daily special posted outside the cute, quaint entrance. I was the jerk who recommended the place... we were humiliated when we asked to see the prices per plate we ordered. $40+ for lunch. For THREE people, no booze. 

We'd ordered from the lunch menu. Had the daily special. We politely asked about the bill and the outrageous price. The waitress returned with scrawled lines, different prices, and it was still $40+. Nothing itemized. Of course we still tipped her, however, it resulted in a fight about it in the parking lot.

Normally, I wouldn't even care to post this review had we not been in a few times prior, tipped extremely well, were kind, polite to the staff... they pretended to recognize us... but we had always ordered off the printed price menu. Should that even matter?!

Buyer beware? Pain in my butt the rest of the month and beyond trying to live down the embarrassment. And now my group refuses to ever give Thai Basil further business-- which leaves me to grovel, find a new Thai place, etc. Sorry but I still feel cheated. Probably from the constant reminders.

AVOID"}
{"text":"I go here for lunch often.  This is a VERY BUSY central downtown location.  If you go early or late, you can usually get a table without a wait.  Small shop - so if you are looking for a place during the busy lunch hour and are at all claustrophobic - avoid it.  The Penang Curry is SO delicious - I get it every time.  Food always comes out quick and hot. Staff are average."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place for Thai take out in Madison. I haven't had a bad dish yet. Though my go to meals are the pad see ewe and pad Thai. Their lunches are super cheap and you get a spring roll. Lunches are more than enough food, you definitely don't feel short changed. Dinners are great too."}
{"text":"Our favorite Thai food in Madison! We usually get the pad thai, yellow curry with beef, and the pot stickers. The fried rice is also delicious. Food is always ready when we go to pick it up. Definitely a hidden gem!"}
{"text":"If you want good (read as: decent) pad thai, you really can't go wrong here. The house soup is a bit bland, but rhen again, I've never been a fan of Thai soups. I think this place is convenient for some good take out as opposed to hitting up other Asian places like Panda Express or whatever. If you work/live in the downtown Tempe area, it's very accessible and there are rarely long waits, which is definitely a plus."}
{"text":"Pad Thai Beef & Pad Thai Tofu tasted like noodles with a hint of dirt. The meet and tofu tasted like nothing. 

Pad Pik King Beef was flavorless meat and vegetables with tomato sauce and sugar. Not a sweet sauce just plain sugar. 

Rama w/Tofu was flavorless vegetables and sugar coated Tofu. Not a sweet sauce just plain sugar. 

We eat Thai food all the time and this is by far the worst."}
{"text":"Ordered the chicken pad Thai. Wife said it was bland and it didn't have any peanut sauce. Had some Thai spring rolls and wasn't a fan of the creamy sauce. Had the pho, was taken back how it was prepped to go, but once I threw everything in a bowl, I enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Wonderful hospitality and delicious food.  Loved the fried rice and chicken pad thai.  Would definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"I have pass this place many times driving home from work. I was glad I stopped.  it was very good.  I have hit every Thai place in town.  I would visit this place again."}
{"text":"It was really good here. I had the veggie spring rolls, veggie cold rolls, and red curry veggie. The red curry veggie was very spicy, but that's how I love it. The food was delicious and had an authentic feel to it. I would definitely come back for sure."}
{"text":"What can i say, they really have not missed on any thing. They make delicious food, their sauces iin all of the dishes ive ordered are spot on. They dont over salt. Vegetables are in abundance(and they are not sliced or cuut up tiniie tiny) the veg they put on your meal is a normal good chunk of vegetable . The fresh rolls are very good, and the peanut sauce for the fresh rools is much better then any other thai restaaurant ive been too. And they do not chintz on portions. Your plate is full. Very clean establishment and the staff is wonderful. Very attentive and friienndly. Lots of university students eat here. If your looking for great thai food this is the place."}
{"text":"This place is near my work so I go there during lunch. The food is always tasty the service is always good."}
{"text":"Came here expecting to eat at Palee's crown and found it had changed to Thai Basil. First impression was good, it looks clean and nice inside and the staff was very welcoming, I had some curry but ordered it medium hot as when this place was Palee's Crown medium was like very hot most other places. The waitress was very charming and when I told her what  wanted and she said she would make it medium and bring me some chili sauce if I wanted it spicier. The food came and was on the mild side but delicious and after I added some chili sauce was perfectly to my liking, The fresh rolls were very good also, like a salad wrapped up in rice noodle with a very delicious sauce, 

The service was excellent and the food very good, Overall a great night."}
{"text":"Still awesome. The wonton soup is fantastic when you feel under the weather.  Strong broth with veggies and tasty wontons. :)"}
{"text":"Just got into Tempe for a conference and needed some good food before the first session began. A friend told me she found this place before and really enjoyed it. I can totally see why. The Tom Kha was amazing with mushrooms and tofu, followed by a Masaman curry that delighted my senses. Such a wonderful meal with friends before getting into session."}
{"text":"Just ate there for the first time.  We were absolutely floored by the fantastic service we received immediately upon entering.  The man greeted us enthusiastically, and when he found out we'd never been there, he told about the most popular dishes on the menu.  The food came quickly (less than 10 minutes), had really good-sized portions and was SO yummy!  Cooked to order, you can see the kitchen, everything looked clean.  They ask what spice heat level you want for each dish, customizing your order to your preferences.  You can also choose from vegetarian, meat or seafood, which was nice.  Prices are very reasonable.  Seating, not so much - there are two tables that each seat two people.  Period.  We ate in and got great service.  We saw a number of people come through for carry out, and they had a delivery driver on hand, it looked like a strong take-out business.  We'll be back!!"}
{"text":"Another happy and successful meal with Thai Basil. I am consistently impressed by their yellow curry. Honestly I have no idea how they get it so much thicker than any other Thai place around but man it makes the difference! It's so creamy and delicious. 
This time around the pad Thai had plenty of sauce and was just delicious as well. 
We also ordered the Massaman (sweet nut curry) and Tom kah soup, both were delicious
Definitely one of the best Thai places in the valley."}
{"text":"There is a reason I ALWAYS come here. The food is always good, the portions are better than any other thai place I've been to. I never pay more than $10. Whoever rates this place less than 4 stars is just being an asshole."}
{"text":"Enjoyable lunch.  The pad thai was good.  Thai tea was enjoyable and the service was good"}
{"text":"Worst drunken noodles ever. Just taste like pepper on noodles with half cooked vegetables."}
{"text":"great food, service!! wonderful variety of thai, chinese, vietnamese & a fresh, full- service sushi bar. i definitely  recommend thai basil to everyone!!!"}
{"text":"Hidden little gem in North Las Vegas. The food is fresh, well prepared and worth the stop. The prices are very reasonable and they have a great lunch and dinner menu.  Staff is very friendly and attentive. I had the wonton soup and garlic shrimp, satisfying portions and very tasty! A must try you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"It's good. Not very interested in going back. So that tells me all I need to know. No real complaints the food just didn't have enough flavor for me. The Thai House is just so much better and within driving distance of this place. If you're in the area and craving Thai it'll pass. It it's definitely NOT going to knock your socks off if you know what I mean."}
{"text":"When I moved to Arizona from Philadelphia, this is where we went on my first night for dinner. It was a great start to my time here. Since then I visit here probably about once a month.

The staff is great. They are always very friendly and polite. They are good at answering questions that you might have about the menu and are always on top of refills.

The selection is good and the food comes out fast. You can specify how spicy you want most of the dishes and they are good about getting it just right. I vary the amount of spiciness depending on my mood and they're always spot on.

The other nice thing about this place is that I have never had to wait for a table. There are always people in there, but it is never full to capacity, so you never have to stand around."}
{"text":"My bf took me to this place and I'm happy he did. It's such a weird restaurant that has everything: chinese, vietnamese, japanese. 

We did try the sushi because it was a special and we actually really liked it. 
We also had a couple chinese dishes that were just well.. chinese dishes.. nothing fancy or special--kinda what you would expect for a chinese restaurant.

I still keep this place in mind when I'm thinking about sushi in north las vegas because there aren't very good ones on this side of town."}
{"text":"Today was my first time at Thai Basil--I was impressed! I had always heard about this place from friends in Tempe, and I can understand why. The restaurant itself was small, but it was pretty busy inside (always a good sign). I started with a Thai coffee, yumbo. Love those. I ordered the spicy chicken fried rice and cleaned my plate.

I left feeling satisfied, but not grossly stuffed. Our server was not overwhelmingly attentive (which I always appreciate) and our food came out very quickly. That Basil is now on my rotation when dining in Tempe."}
{"text":"I love this place.  I am completely biased, and you should consider this review totally biased.  I love the people, I love the food, I love everything about it.  That said...

Every plate of everything is delicious, and if you get it 'Thai Hot', expect to sweat.  They offer mild, medium, hot, and thai hot.  They don't openly tell people about 'Thai Hot' because it's serious business, and you will have digestive problems the next day as a result, I promise.

Either way, everything is delicious and wonderful.  The staff are enormously friendly and know me by name.  The place is nicely decorated, and it is great for a first date.  Check it out and enjoy, but be careful during lunch as it can get busy and have a wait."}
{"text":"The dishes that I have eaten here are excellent! Last night I had the the Thai Basil and tonight I had the Larb Kai. The spices in the Larb were wonderfully blended mixing the fresh flavors of the vegetables with Thai peppers.

I will absolutely return to Thai Basil on my next trip to Tempe!!"}
{"text":"Apparently this is the second branch of the more known Thai Basil located in Bloor. I had to try this place out with the couple of Dine.TO awards posted at the front drawing me in. I've never gone to the original but have to say I'm quite impressed with what I have been served here so far.

I'm in no position to say how authentic the food is but I can definitely taste the Thai ingredients in it, like palm sugar instead of sugar, the lime leaves, the lemongrass, galangal, where I cannot say the same for other restaurants I've tried. Servings size is more than satisfactory and they don't skimp on the ingredients. Mango salad is mostly mango (not extenders as I've seen many times elsewhere),  a lot of coconut cream over milk, (therefore sauces are very thick) etc. 

This is only place in I've tried in my lifetime where I actually appreciated a bowl of tom yum. Never liked that stuff but I thoroughly enjoyed this one. According to my wife it was almost exactly like what she had in Bangkok albeit this one was not as hot (and yes it was hot).

Overall, excellent food so far, I have yet to be disappointed."}
{"text":"If this place is part of the other Thai Basil at 1st and Adams...stay away. Very unsanitary and they do not abide by any health regulations. They do NOT clean their kitchen EVER!!! Don't know how they stay open.. Must be paying someone off. Horrible food poisoning!!!"}
{"text":"This place was superb! I got lunch to-go because I was short on time. I'm always nervous to try new Thai food places because I've been to new places before and they weren't good! I got the mild Pad See Eiw with chicken. Flavor was great and the egg roll that came with the lunch portion was crispy! Only reason I'm giving a 4 and not a 5 is because I got a canned soda. I was hoping for a fountain drink to-go. Ill be back!"}
{"text":"My husband and I enjoy ordering Thai Basil for delivery. I love the Pra Luck with tofu (Peanut Sauce) and he orders the Green Curry with Chicken. He says it's the best green curry he's ever had. We also recommend the crab rangoons - very creamy and not overly sweet. He tried the Tom Kha soup today and says it has a very rich flavor and tasty veggies."}
{"text":"Staff was super friendly and that's where the 2 stars come from. As for the food it was ok at best. I ordered the BBQ beef and it was lacking some serious flavor. My wife ordered the coconut soup which had some flavor but didn't really scream coconut. Perhaps another attempt would be in order to try some other plates. Get their early it is rather small although you can set outside."}
{"text":"My favorite Thai food restaurant in Tempe. There are a couple of other locations but this one is right next to the Mcdonald's off of University. 

Service is fast/prompt. I've never had to wait more than 10 minutes after ordering. The lunch special is reasonably priced and includes an entree, egg roll and soup. 

They offer a range of ''spiciness'' from 1-5. I usually go for 3 or 4 depending on how I'm feeling. 5 is Thai Hot and it's too hot for me. I love the Thai ice tea and wish they were refillable. 

There is a bar here but never ordered a drink."}
{"text":"Thai food and restaurant service in general does not get better anywhere in Tempe than here. I've been patronizing them since they opened, as I also did the Japanese restaurant that preceded them here. They've always been very good, but in the past year they have seriously improved to possibly my favorite place to eat in all of Tempe. I somewhat suspect that some of the 1-2 star reviews for this location are by competitors.

A hallmark of food such as this is the freshness and quality of the veggies and meats that they use in their dishes and theirs is always very clean and fresh tasting. Everything from the soup they give you prior to your main meal, to the jasmine iced tea to the heavier foods with sauces such as the curries and pad thai. They are very good about asking what spice level you would like and delivering on that choice. The value is quite excellent also; the amount of food you receive for the price is absolutely spot on.

As for service - they are kind, friendly and very attentive. Even during crazy lunch rushes, they seem to try and have a full staff with everyone dutifully attending their roles and tending to their customers. As a stated previously by at least one reviewer, their parking lot is very small. However, I've been there before during one of the lunch rushes and one of them actually came out of the establishment the moment I pulled in and helped direct me around their building to a good place to park. Just absolutely outstanding service.

No question I'm a fan. I stress to anyone who feels that they've had a bad experience here, give them another try. It will absolutely be worth it. It's a small, family run establishment that puts a lot of heart into their food and I appreciate that greatly."}
{"text":"I have been here several times before, and keep returning partially because I like the food, but also due to the location.  The food is good, but not the best Thai food that I have had.  Most recently, I went there for lunch, and I had the tom yum soup, and shared some vegetarian cold rolls with my boyfriend.  I liked the soup a lot - it was very very tasty.  I have had better cold rolls.  They were flavourless, and they did not provide enough dipping sauce.  It is a biiiiiit expensive for the quality of food that you are getting.  Also, if it's a cold day, don't sit near the windows, as it's drafty.  Overall, I liked it, and would probably go back for the tom yum soup again."}
{"text":"Nothing too exciting.  The lunch dish came with a quick serving of salad drenched with dressing.  I would have preferred the dressing on the side.  As for the entree, I ordered the thai basil special with chicken.  Nothing really stood out and it was typical.  The vegetables seeemed overcooked because they were a bit too soft.  Otherwise the chicken was just thrown into the dish."}
{"text":"I didn't give the full five stars because of various reasons : We ordered the appetizer platter to try a little of all and nothing from the platter stood out. The chicken and beef satay were tough and the rest of the items were bland. Their beef panang was also bland. Also, their banana fritter had a very thick coating when this type of dessert is usually airy and light. The waitress seemed to be in a rush to get us out of there which was bothersome and got on our nerves. All in all however, we enjoyed the deco, the drinks(non alc), soups, and green curry. Hopefully they won't be in such a rush to get us out of there next time seeing that we ordered enough for a party of 5 and still were hurried."}
{"text":"I came here with friends after an intense workout. We were all starving and wanted large quantities of food, lots of carbs. So of course Thai food came to mind. We were seated right away and I ordered the cashew dish with tofu, it was so good!!! The restaurant had great service and this wasn't my first time here so already knew they had great food. Love this place need to come here more often. It such yummy Thai comfort food, great for after a draining week, when it's raining, when it's cold, when you're super hungry, after you finished a really heard work out. Basically most of the time this place will satisfy you."}
{"text":"I had lunch with my wife.  I ordered the beef panang with rice for $5.95, my wife ordered Sriracha Beef for $6.50.  The Sriracha Beef came with an egg roll (that I ate) and fried rice that the wife substituted with white rice.  I'm a good sized guy and I did not finish my beef panang and rice.  A nice sized portion, and it tasted great.  On a 1-10 for spicy, I ordered an 8.  Yummmm.  The wife enjoyed the Sriracha Beef, a spicy dish with veggies and cooked in Sriracha chiles.  She could not finish her portions.  The service was brisk.  They gave a free refill on the Thai iced tea!  Two people ate for about $15.50.  A very good value, tasty food, and prompt service."}
{"text":"Could be 5 Star

If they only had a few more tables.  In Madison for an overnight business trip and craving Thai.  Thai Basil was pretty close to the hotel.  But must have mis-read the reviews, thought a few said service was improved.  Fortunately there are two tables and no wait.  (Besides - nothing worse that eating take out in a hotel room - SOOOO stereotypical).  So sat in the place and had delicious fried tofu and a wonderful Pad See U; always like the wide noodles.  Washed down with a smooth Thai Iced Tea.  And had the place to ourselves, so can't complain about the service and view of the kitchen."}
{"text":"I'm new to Madison, been here a month, and already eaten here 4 times. I'm not that familiar with Thai food so been trying a different dish each time. They have all been great. The Garden Rolls are cool, lettuce stuffed with veggies and wrapped in rice paper. The entrees are very filling and affordable, about $8 will feed two people easily. It's not really a sit down place, more of a take out joint though there are two little tables if you want to eat there.  Service is fast and friendly."}
{"text":"I go to Thai Basil almost every week and the Panang or Massaman Chicken curries with brown rice are my faves. I like somewhere on the spice level between Medium and Hot, but I cannot do spicier than Medium here. If you are feeling crazy, try Thai Hot on the spice meter. Drink a LOT of water.

This restaurant turns out great food super quickly and you get a satisfying meal for $10. 

There are 2 reasons why I can't give Thai Basil 5 stars... 
1. You don't get the yummy free salad if you get an order to go
And
2. They told me it would cost $1 for a to-go cup of my drink (The Good Egg next door gives you free to go cups filled fresh).

Still, great Thai food and a great group of waiters.

I'll be back."}
{"text":"This is my fourth time coming here. I always order the curry with either tofu or shrimp, but it's all delicious. The Thai Iced Tea is my favourite beverage here and the staff is always super nice. They are courteous and friendly. I will always stop by if I am in the area. Food comes out fast and piping hot.
This place is a must if you like Thai food."}
{"text":"alright so location....eh....but when your inside you still cant get that out of your head.....BUT when the food come lol your mind can definately forget where you are.....and the food is very good and the establishment is clean aswell we usually get some sort of curry and desert ....price is good and the staff are nice!"}
{"text":"Very friendly staff, great tasting \"American-Thai\", and the signature Thai-Basil, is incredibly delicious. The management team even brought our table a slice of cake with a lit candle upon realizing we were celebrating a birthday, awesome!"}
{"text":"This is my office favorite for lunch.  

Lunch here is always speedy, but also very good.  During peak lunch times, my office mates and I can always come here and find a seat.  Within minutes of being seated, we are served a starter salad with a delicious sesame dressing. 

I have tried several of the dishes and been pleased with all.  Some of my favorites include the eggplant, spicy vegetable, and the green and red curries.  My only complaint is that the \"spicy\" isn't super spicy.  That being said, spicy carry some heat, and it's enough to please me and keep me coming back.  

Oh, and did I mention the price?  Lunch with tax and tip usually runs me about eleven dollars.  Not bad for a hot lunch, salad and egg roll with quick service!"}
{"text":"The BEST Thai iced tea in the Valley bar none !!! Excellent stir fried and curry dishes too. Love it !"}
{"text":"The Pad Thai had WAAAYYYY too much peanut flavoring, could not finish it. And the yellow curry was alright. The coconut milk used in it is what I had to get use to. Service was good. Place is small but clean and popular. We came around 12 and music wasn't playing so it was a little awkward at first for all the guests I could see. They are very frequent in filling up waters. As for the food overall the best part had to be the side egg roll that came with our dishes ."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service!   Best we have found during our visit to the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"For some reason I've just recently made it over to Thai Basil after finding out that our regular Tempe Thai restaurant (Thai Rama) had closed.

The good: 
- Great flavor for green curry. Asked for medium and it was a medium spice. 
- Prices- 2 curries, plus rice and one Thai Iced Tea was $24 + tip.  
- Atmosphere was fine, not too big at all (I'd call ahead for larger groups). Service was good as well. 
- Thai iced teas are HUGE! Get a small. If you get a large it comes in pretty much a large beer mug. 

The bad:
- Yellow curry was definitely lacking spice and flavor. I asked for a medium as well, and the spice was maybe a mild. I ended up mixing with my dad's green curry
- Vegetables were undercooked and quite hard (esp. carrots)
- Chicken was extremely dry. Usually dry chicken in curries at least have the ability to soak up some of the curry liquids; this chicken was very, very dry. 

I'd go back again- but wouldn't take someone there for their first Thai experience."}
{"text":"Othis place is totally awesome! It's a small place around University and Mill right by ASU so it get pretty busy... But man oh man! Parking was a b*tch... I guess we came during rush hour... But I got lucky and found a spot so everything was fine :)

Service was great super fast and friendly staff. They refilled our water constantly too!! 

We got chicken pad thai and red curry chicken! Both mild haha.. I like the sweet and salty taste and a tiny hint of spice... Maybe one day I'll try a spicier kind.. But anyways.. Enjoyed it so much that I can't wait to eat my left overs!!

I love pad thai! 

And the curry was pretty creamy tasting even if the soup it self doesn't have the creamy consistency..

Idk thai food is just kinda addicting lol...

Totally just realized We forgot to order dessert :( but next time!!

Can't wait to come back!

4 stars for parking!!

Portions are family size and definitely for sharing!!"}
{"text":"We ordered take out (they only have take out or delivery). the time quoted was accurate and the food arrives hot. I got the pineapple fried rice with tofu instead of meat and got it medium. It was very flavorful and not too spicy. However someone else got he pineapple curry medium and it was significantly hotter-does not seem to be consistent with levels. Also for having a pineapple dish, there was only about two pieces of pineapple in it which was pretty disappointing."}
{"text":"Thai Basil is really clean, staff is very friendly. I usually order the chicken curry lunch special. Medium spiciness is more like a very mild but you can always adjust the spice level up. Can get crowded at lunch time."}
{"text":"Had my first visit at this place today and I meant to eat in but my daughter was in a hurry so I ordered to go.  I ordered the simplest most common dish, beef chow mien.    I was disappointed at how extremely dry the noodles were.  So much so, that they were even stuck together and looked like rubber bands, stretching as I tried to eat.  

I read some of the other reviews about their large portions and I'd have to disagree...at least with my take out.  I was shocked to see how small the portion was.  Maybe I shouldn't say small...but I guess you could say, \"enough to feed one person\", no second meal with this.  I must mention...I'm not a big eater so when most people say you get two meals out of it, I can usually get three from it.  The portion I brought home was enough for me to have my one meal...absolutely no left overs.  Yah...it was small.

The waitress that served me was very sweet and courteous.  All though I first ordered to sit down and eat in and then had to change it to go...she was very quick to change it and a huge smile on her face.  I still left her a nice tip.  The place is very clean and inviting.  All though I'm a bit disappointed with my chow mien, I'd still give them another try."}
{"text":"Not only is the food great, but so is the customer service. I ordered through grub hub. My food didn't show up when expected, so I called both the restaurant and grub hub to find out that the system was down and the driver could not receive the delivery information. The woman working (presumably the owner) at Thai Basil offered to deliver the food herself. She was here within a few minutes with the hot food in hand. Happy customer here!"}
{"text":"This is a small run down place by ASU, I have been here a couple times before. On this occasion I ordered the orange chicken. Big mistake. The chicken was soggy and disgusting, it tasted like it was dunked in a glass of orange kool-aid. I wasn't even able to finish my meal. Not to mention the vegetables were cold and hard when they were supposed to be steamed to perfection. After finishing my meal I was accompanied by horrific bowl movements for the remainder of the night along with stomach pain. Coincidence? I think not. I will not be returning to this place due to the terrible quality of food."}
{"text":"Thai Basil on University Dr is absolutely delicious! When I lived closer to Tempe, it was one of the places I went to frequently, and I still make the drive to go there.

I typically get the Panang Curry with chicken but also really like the Drunken Noodles and Pad Thai. Every time I've gone with someone else they've enjoyed their meal as well. The veggies they use always seem crisp & fresh, and the spice level is always on point. If you ask for mild, it really is mild, if you ask for hot, they really bring on the heat!

My only note is that during lunch and dinner hours it gets really busy, and while they have parking in front of the restaurant, it fills up quickly. If you're going to get something to pick-up, I suggest going at an off-time so you don't run into any problems with that. Either way, the wait and parking pains are worth it!"}
{"text":"This was an unexpected find here in Phoenix, a good noodle shop. I really enjoy the rice noodles with chicken or beef both are great. I have not tired the coconut soup but many other customers have been ordering in when I have gone in for take out and rave about it so that will be one on the list to try. They have dine in or take out. The servers are very pleasant and give good recommendations or explanations of the dishes. I would have given them 5 stars but the service can be a little slow but well worth the wait."}
{"text":"LOVE this place!! Everything I've ever ordered there is fabulous! Heart their peanut sauce in particular. I want that recipe:) The ambiance at the restaurant is great as well, it's a small place though so remember during peak times it fills up fast!"}
{"text":"I ordered take-out tonight for the first time since moving to the area.  We order two dishes, one dish at a level 4 (Evil Jungle Noodles) and my dish (Drunken Noodle) at a level 2.  Unfortunately there must of been a mishap because my dish was also a level 4.  While it tasted delicious i could only eat a few bites before my mouth could take no more heat.  My friend loved her dish but I will be worried about ordering over the phone again."}
{"text":"Thaii Basil has the best Thai food in the valley. Their ingredients are always fresh and flavorful. Don't miss the Coconut Shrimp soup and Pad Thai  Noodles. There are several
Locations. I prefer the location in Tempe on University near Mill Ave. The service is always friendly."}
{"text":"This location kicks the other ones ass! There curry is excellent!!! This is the only one I go to now because the food is consistently good and the service is fast!"}
{"text":"\"Honey I Shrunk the Lunch Specials and the Restaurant, too!\" is more apropos of a name for Thai Basil. Now don't get me wrong, I like Thai Basil.  The food is decent and the interior is nice, but the tables/diners seem to be squished elbow-to-elbow New York style. Spartan, but slightly upscale, this restaurant ALWAYS seems to have a wait.  

The yellow curry here is my favorite with a delicious balance of coconut, spice, carrots chicken and potatoes.  I can't ever seem to get enough, and I really mean that.  The portions here are small, and while lunch portions are expectedly small, portions elsewhere (at Chanpen Thai, for example) are larger and less expensive. Elsewhere the Thai BBQ chicken comes with 1/2 a chicken, but at Thai Basil they give you three lonely strips like cheapos!  The massaman curry and pad thai are pretty good too, but I feel they're just OK.  I've had better.

Service is hit or miss here.  One thing that's consistent: they always seem to be understaffed. Once when I was dining alone (at a 4-person table) they had the nerve to ask me to move while in the middle of eating, to a 2-person table. 

To me, Thai Basil is style over substance.  Not impressed.  Next."}
{"text":"Love the pad thai - their pad thai is not greasy and when I order the beef pad thai, it also has tofu. Panang curry is also good. I went to this restaurant three times this past week :)"}
{"text":"I tried the green curry pork and the curry flavor was spot on.  It had eggplant which was good, and broccoli which is strange for Thai curry.  The dining room is very small and crowded (the servers barely have room to walk), so be prepared to get it to go or to sit outside in the heat.  The lunch portion was very small so if you are very hungry you should ask for the dinner menu.  Price was OK.  Green Curry pork with salad, spring roll, and can of coke was $10.50."}
{"text":"Food is always awesome! Very friendly service.

I'm a big Tom Yum fan and had a hard time finding a place in that makes it well...until I found Thai Basil. Thai Basil (by far) has the best Tom Yum in Phoenix (among other dishes).

Definitely recommend anyone try it if they're a Thai fan."}
{"text":"Consistently the best Thai restaurant in the area. Crab Rangoon is the best I've ever had and you must finish with the sweet rice with mango."}
{"text":"Came back with the kids. The lunch specials were too pricy for what you get. I wont come back again."}
{"text":"Do not judge the book by its cover.

We looked at the menu posted on the window, thinking the prices are okay. We walked in and saw the decor, and thought, \"uh oh\"... Decor is nice, but we wanted to find authentic Thai food, not westernized fancy upscale Thai.

We ordered a curry and a Pad Thai. Curry is good, but nowadays you can buy any curry mix (red, yellow, green, panang, you name it) at many Asian grocery stores. T&T carries different variety of really good curry mix!

The Pad Thai is NOT authentic!!! Traditional Pad Thai uses fish sauce. Westernized Pad Thai uses ketchup. Whenever I visit a Thai restaurant with ketchup Pad Thai, I never return. This restaurant is one of them!

Service overall was slow and unfriendly. I notice some customers were waiving their hand trying to flag a server.

Food was very slow, we waited about 20 minutes.

Portion was extremely small!!!! The curry which cost about $12, comes with only a small bowl of curry, and no rice! Rice is $1.50 a bowl, but the bowl is super small.

Atmosphere was very upscale, but lack lighting, and was very noisy. It was difficult to start a conversation."}
{"text":"A very popular restaurant in the Annex and I can see why it's appealing in that it serves fresh, tasty, unexciting Thai food.  I tried the thai basil chili noodle with chicken (very good), kana chinese broccoli in a garlic chili sauce (the best part of the meal), and ginger beef (very chewy).  A decent meal overall but nothing overly exciting."}
{"text":"So my job orders from here frequently. So after someone let me try their curry fried rice, I was in love ! So I ordered the dinner size shrimp curry fried rice and some sweet and sour chicken. IT WAS SO GOOD! Like I'm absolutely satisfied with these choices. My husband and I both were satisfied with the flavors. I'd definitely order from here again. Both dishes were $10 each. But the lunch specials cost less. When I called, they said lunch specials end at 3:00pm."}
{"text":"Thai Basil is my go to Thai food place. It is consistently delicious and the portions are large enough for leftovers. Spicy meter is consistent as well.
There's not much else to say here."}
{"text":"I liked this place! cute little spot near the university, packed with college kids... we got a little table in the corner, good service for a Saturday night. I got pad Thai and spring rolls... I liked both but there was corn in my spring rolls which was a first for me and I think my pad Thai may have had soy sauce in it...also unusual for me. Everything was reasonably priced, good parking and nice area."}
{"text":"I went here to just grab a quick to-go lunch. I got the Pad Thai with chicken cooked with no heat. You can have the options to have the Pad Thai mild or spicy hot. I was feeling timid so got the mild.

The Pad Thai was awesome! I really liked the sauce they use as it is on the sweet side which I particularly like. If you'd like to see a picture of what I ate, you can see it on my food blog: http://bit.ly/bkrvl3

My to-go lunch Pad Thai + egg roll was $7.55 with tax which to me is a real bargain. I will definitely come back here for lunch or dinner to try other dishes."}
{"text":"I would give this a five star, but I am particular about Thai Food. Most of my four star comes from the tea I got so it may be kind of biased. I ordered a tofu dish and I was not displeased. It's a nice spot if you need some food casually. I had a nice experience at the restaurant and would also recommend it to vegetarians."}
{"text":"My new favorite lunch spot!
I had a co-worker that told me this place was great and I have been wanting to eat here forever.  I finally stopped by the other day for lunch and I was so happy I did!
The interior is beautiful and the place has an initmate feel to it.  
I was worried because they literally had one server working and it was getting busy.  That one server ran his butt off and made sure everyone was taken care of.  I was so impressed!  Our food came out in a timely manner we had fresh refills and he had several large tables he handled at the same time.  
My chicken pad thai was awesome and at $5.95 I cant imagine finding a better lunch deal.  My boyfriend had curry beef that was also inexpensive and tasted perfectly spicy and delicous.  
Overall a great experience and we will be back, alot!!"}
{"text":"Convenient to ASU, friendly service, simple warm ambiance, and pretty decent Thai food. I've had AMAZING spicy Pad Thai here and then the next time it was only so-so, so the consistency is a bit hard to predict. I really like that they offer different levels of spiciness for their menu options (personally, medium doesn't seem spicy at all to me). I enjoy the fried tofu with sweet and spicy sauce, the papaya salad (order it spicy!), the Pad Prik King (green beans, carrots and lemon leaves stir-fried with your protein of choice), and either the Pad Thai or the Pad Woon Sen (glass noodles). Service has always been extremely nice and prompt."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times, spaced over two or three years. The service quality is pretty consistent and positive. Great decor and ambience. We ordered the chicken panang curry with rice and pineapple fried rice. Curry was delicious, with lots of coconut milk taste the way I like. Pineapple fried rice was standard. Prices are reasonable. Would come again."}
{"text":"Great value for the money sums this place up!

I split my visits between the regular entree visits and their lunch special.

The lunch special gives you a salad, roll, soup, and entree for only $9 and is delicious every time!  The soups are not as consistent, however, ranging from perfect to too salty - but still delicious in either case.  Ordering an entree off the regular menu is just as delicious.  I've had great curries and their eggplant is also well made.

The actual restaurant has modern decor and is quite comfortable for lunch. I haven't visited for dinner, but have heard that the ambiance can be very romantic when the lights have been dimmed."}
{"text":"It's about the most average Thai food you can eat. If there is a place that looks better near here try it out, but it's not that bad. I go here when I don't feel like going any further than I have to. I'd give 3.5 stars but since I can't I'm rounding up"}
{"text":"I tried 3 different curries and they all tasted the same. Vegetables in a curry were previously frozen for about a year or so therefore they lack any taste or texture whatsoever. Dinner portions are large enough but if you eat it the next day, there will be a terrible aftertaste of the cheapest oil on Earth. Service is ok but not the friendliest."}
{"text":"Great food awesome service my wife and I try to eat there once a week . 
The spring rolls are a must have"}
{"text":"I really love the food of Thai Basil but the service is either great or terrible. The food and some of the servers make it worth the drive, time, and sometimes hassle."}
{"text":"The food was great, I am always looking for great Thai food and this place didn't disappoint"}
{"text":"I went here for the lunch special the other day and It was pretty solid. I remember ordering from this place all of the time in university when it was too cold out or we were too hungover to move, but this was my first time actually being inside. 

Over all the place has a warm feel. Pretty nice decor and really attentive servers. My boyfriend and I both ordered the lunch special which comes with Tom Yum Soup, a spring roll and a main dish. I was really surprised with how much food we got. It's reallllllly worth the 10 bucks!  
Everything was really tasty but thing only thing negative I could say was I wanted a bit more curry..I like my food drowning in sauce sometimes..you know? 

If you're in the area and you're hungry for a filling lunch I suggest you check this place out!"}
{"text":"After reading such great reviews me and my boyfriend decided to try. Great food and a wonderful price. Thai tea was sooo good as well a the green curry with pork. Wonderful spring rolls and great service. The place was packed at lunch time and I would definitely go again. Awesome and highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I have now ordered takeout from Thai Basil twice. I've had the Pad Thai, Crab Rangoon and Tom Kha soup. 

Service is fairly quick, it takes about 30 minutes from placing your order to pickup. They also deliver. 

The Pad Thai is some of the best I've had in Madison. Definitely better than some of the restaurants closer to me. The Tom Kha soup is also very, very good. Its' perfect for a cold day when you're not feeling so hot. I would have liked it with less mushrooms and more chicken but that's me being picky. The Crab Rangoon is just okay. Not the best but not terrible either. The last time I ordered it it came out lukewarm at best which was a big disappointment. I probably won't order it again."}
{"text":"I miss Thai Basil (this and the Rural Rd one) now that I live in Texas. I make a point to grab takeout every time I pass through town. No one can do yellow curry like they do.  There is just the right balance of base (broth) and coconut milk - so creamy, a little sweet, and as spicy as you can take it. I used to get it with beef, but the Rural Rd location started using (apparent) lower quality and now I've switched to Tofu. I like that the veggies (onion, potato, carrot) still have substance to them. Not undercooked, just right. I realize these two locations are separated now, but I still consider them under the same umbrella - and this one was the original. 
Service has always been great for sit down or take out and their Thai tea is excellent. 

Seriously, I pine for this place while living in Austin."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere and good service. Food was just not up to par given the price point. Between my friends and myself, I tried the cashew chicken, red curry beef, and curry brisket. The cashew chicken had a really strong poultry smell like the chicken was old or something. Rice is extra cost (never experienced this at any other Thai resto). The red curry was my favourite but still not the best I had. For this price Sukothai is an excellent option with more menu items!"}
{"text":"I keep coming back to Thai Basil. There don't see to be many Thai restaurants in the 905 area so j can't say this is my favourite, but it probably would be.

This time I tried their Thai Iced Tea, Friend rice baked in  young coconut and baked seafood in red curry. Curry here is always delicious and flavourful. Slightly spicy with hints of sweet creaminess. No flavour overpowers one another and instead compliment each other very well. Whether this be red or yellow curry, it is always delicious. Not to thick and not too runny. 

The fried rice in coconut was also delicious. The rice was fried with coconut juice and also strips and chunks of coconut meat/flesh. It was aromatic and sweet tasting.

I can't wait to go back and try more!"}
{"text":"The interior is pretty extravagant, considering how cheap the dishes are. I ordered the chicken drunken noodles (pad kee mao), and did not enjoy it very much. It just tasted like a bland blend of salty sauces with a barely existent tinge of basil. The menu was very diverse with Vietnamese, Thai, Chinese foods, which probably explains why the drunken noodles did not taste Thai at all."}
{"text":"Ordered the red curry with chicken. Tasted good until I found a roach in it. I will not ever eat there again. Disgusting."}
{"text":"Amazing! One of my favorite Thai food places. My boyfriend and I go here all the time. Great price, speedy service, and your choice of protein and spicy level. 

I usually get the Pad Thai noodles and they are exceptional. The amount of food you get is enough to take home for a second meal or snack. Unless your like my boyfriend who somehow demolishes everything and doesn't gain a pound. We also like to finish with mango and sticky rice. Omg it's the most delicious treat ever. 

I would recommend this place to everyone who loves Thai!"}
{"text":"I really like this place, it is my favorite Thai restaurant in north GTA. They have great selection of curries, very good tom yum goong (my favorite soup), and for non-adventurous their pad-thai is quite good too. My favorite dish there is smoked duck with tamarind sauce - yummy!
Rating is 4 stars because of service, I've been in this place like 10 times but rarely seen smiles on waiter's faces and often didn't even get \"thanks\" and \"good by\" after paying the bill (despite leaving good tip). Yet, the food is good so I come back again :-)"}
{"text":"You guys complaining about the soup are idiots. It is the best soup I've ever had.If you don't like Tom Yom soup, don't order it, and espcially don't write nasty reviews about how bad it is. The reason you don't like the soup is that you don't like that kind of soup. It is the best Tom Yom in Toronto. Your criticisms are like someone complaining about a creme of mushroom soup being too cremey and tasting too much of mushroom, or not liking a chicken soup because your vegetarian so you couldn't eat it. THIS IS THE BEST TOM YOM I'VE EVER HAD. Don't listen to the haters complaining about the soup. They've probably never had Tom Yom soup before. They are probably not even Thai and have no idea what they are talking about."}
{"text":"F yeah!  This place rules.  Curry is amazing.  Even if you choose a meat they load it with vegetables.  Nice serving size.  The Thai Basil and Ginger are also good menu options.  Yum.  Lunch special is really well priced without compromising quality.  Love them."}
{"text":"If you are planning on spending 8 dollars for lunch at a fast food joint, all the while wishing you could have ANYTHING else but that, take your 8 dollars and head over to Thai Basil. I love love love this place! 
Recently had the masaman curry with tofu, at a medium spicy level, and was so pleased that I vowed to return again the next day! The lunch combos come  with your main dish, a spring roll and rice. Next time, I will have to try the Thai Iced tea. 
Fast and friendly service, clean restrooms, a really sweet Thai mom at the counter all make Thai Basil well deserving of 5 stars."}
{"text":"Nice, ordinary, solid Thai menu, good for a quick lunch, which includes a spring roll and a tom yum soup with my green curry. Typically, the spring rolls in these types of combos are unremarkable, and this was no different, though the soup was very good. You think you're getting a great deal because it's three items for the price, and while the soup is a lovely start to the meal, the spring roll is nothing special. My partner had regular chicken fried rice served in a hollowed-out half pineapple- exactly what he was craving, good, but not high-end."}
{"text":"Wow! We found this restaurant on Yelp and we were not let down!

This is a tiny place and it gets PACKED with people lining out the door for lunch so get there early if you want to be seated right away.

We had the fried tofu and I wouldn't get it again as it was bland but the rest of the food we ordered was fantastic.  We are vegan and they accommodated us by leaving out the egg and offered tofu as a protein.  We had the vegetable fried rice and the coconut curry.  We asked for it to be \"very spicy, Thai spicy\" and she said \"we can make it a 5 or double, triple or even quadruple that\" so we asked for it to be \"double\" and it had just the right amount of heat for us.

We will be returning!"}
{"text":"OK, I have only been here one time.  And that was the last time.  Sat down and looked at the menu.  I saw the mixed seafood plate which comes with shrimp, scallops, fish fillet and squid.  

I asked my waiter how it was prepared.  
       He answered, \"in a sweet and sour sauce.\"  
Me: \"sweet and sour sauce?\" (incredulously)  
       Waiter: \"Well, mostly sour sauce.\" 
\"Are you sure?\" 
       \"No, not really.\"  
\"Can you please go ask?\"

I ended up ordering it as it usually is prepared in some fantastic basil/thai chili paste sauce that I love.  It arrived, just as advertised, in a lemon, fish sauce, chili-flakes concoction.  The scallops pieces were microscopic, the few squid rings were rubbery, and the fish fillet was gross--all on a bed of lettuce to distract you from the real size of your $13 or$14 entree.  The sauce was as simple, and uninspired, as explained to me by the newly-informed waiter.  The amount of fish was disappointing.  The sauce was below average.  

I am only giving this place 2 stars, instead of one, because if I lived here, I might be forced to return.  There don't seem to be many Thai restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"I haven't been to Thai Basil in a couple years since we're usually not in Tempe. I remember liking it previously so I was happy to stop here when our other lunch plans fell through.

The soup that came with the lunch special had unusually sweet broth. Unfortunately, this carried over to my entree as well. I love pad thai, but I could barely eat my dish because the sauce was cloyingly sweet. I ordered medium heat which was very mild so adding some extra chili sauce helped combat some of the sweetness.

My husband got the green curry which he liked, but not nearly as much as our neighborhood place. The portion was pretty small, and he left hungry.

We were happy with the quick service during a busy lunch hour. I wouldn't come back here though."}
{"text":"Went to Thai Basil today for lunch for the first time and loved it. I got the sweet nut curry (chicken) with jasmine rice and a nice tall glass of jasmine iced tea.

The food was great and the service was fine. I have read reviews here that the service is poor, which I personally did not witness, although the place was packed.

The only complaint I have is that there wasn't enough rice for me - then again, I am sort of a pig when it comes to jasmine rice.

Would recommend Thai Basil if you like curry/Thai"}
{"text":"I had the Pad Thai (with chicken) combo for takeout at lunch today.  The lemon grass soup was very delicious, I would have been happy to have a huge bowl for a meal!  

The Pad Thai itself left a lot to be desired.  It wasn't dry, but there was no sauce.  The noodles were orange, and that's about it. No flavour. I added my own sriracha from our own supply at work. There was a decent amount of chicken and tofu. 

The fried spring roll was not crispy, it was actually chewy like it was just microwaved. Sad face!"}
{"text":"Just had spicy mango curry with chicken instead of shrimp, chicken pad Thai with 5/5 spice level, crab Rangoon and tom yum soup!! Every dish was on point!! Will definitely order again!!"}
{"text":"Decent prices and decent food for lunch special. Staff was friendly.


Orders panang curry and the flavor was good and the amount of portion was good except the meat was a tiny portion.

I looked a couple of times to make sure, and it could have not have been more than 2 small pieces!

The vegetables were done correctly with the right amount of cooked/crisp balance

Had mangoes and sticky rice for dessert. Decent but not the best I have had.


Would have liked to give better, the staff was nice but the lack of meat portion was damaging."}
{"text":"Very tasty Thai food, they have variety of gluten free options. It's very close to Ted roggers cinema, which is perfect for when you finish watching a movie and just can't think of anything other than food!"}
{"text":"I don't write reviews often. I've been here 3 times and it is a hidden gem. Thank God for yelp.. The pad thai and drunken noodles  are amazing. Curries and sushi is great too.. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"My favorite Thai place in Arizona! I was a regular when I was dorming at ASU, now I unfortunately come less often since I live farther. I took a friend my last visit and he absolute loved it. My favorite menu item is the tofu silver noodle plate with mild spice."}
{"text":"I've only visited once, but they've already won our loyalty!

I had the shrimp Pad Thai (I know, cliche but what can I say - I like noodles!) and my husband had the curry. The food was ready quickly, and we could both tell the ingredients were very fresh. And the portions were huuuuuuge! I ate most of my food but still had enough to eat leftovers for dinner. It was about $30 for 2 people, to give you an idea of price; the portions made that price well worth the money.

Our server was also so friendly! I think she was smiling the entire time, even before we got there. What a ray of sunshine! =) We recommend this place, and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Just okay.  Not the best Thai place.  Skip the Pad Thai (worst I've ever had.). Price is okay, but I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Thai Basil, how disappointing. I've ordered from your establishment every other week for the past two years, but we were very disappointed by tonight's encounter. My wife and I ordered noodles, spicy level 2, which is our regular order, but when we received it, it was insane spicy... inedibly spicy. We called and you refused to make us a new one, claiming the peppers are spicier depending on the batch. This may be true, but what you should have followed up with was, \"and we apologize, and of course we'll fix you food.\" At no point in the conversation did you consider the happiness of your customer. You make great food, but you decided one dish was worth losing a customer over. Disappointing."}
{"text":"I truly enjoyed my visit here first time trying Thai food in Arizona they were excellent requested everything that I wanted and they made it for me the menu is very condensed and expandable to what you would like they can add in anything that you would suggest

I got the typhoid rice with chicken and beef it was awesome I got it medium but ask for some chili paste on the side which helps for you to manage how hot you want your food to be the dumplings were awesome the place is just nice and quaint you got to get there though to get a seed because it's limited space or you can do the carry out which is excellent.

I definitely will be going back very soon to try the other items that are on the menu you have to give this place to try don't sleep on it's right there in the corner right there on Fisher and University don't pass it up five stars"}
{"text":"Bad service. server took away my friend's soup before she was done. ordered takeout but I was ignored. Food is not enough to bear this."}
{"text":"My go-to Thai place in Toronto. Huge portions, convenient take out, and delicious dishes. 
I would eat there daily if I had the expendable income and calories."}
{"text":"We did take-out. It was relatively speedy, about 30 or 40 minutes although we only live 2 miles away. My girlfriend ordered the Pad Thai and was very pleased! She gave me a taste and I agreed wholeheartedly. My green curry was tasty but left a bit to be desired. Not much meat/eggplant in there, though the coconut milk was tasty."}
{"text":"Classic authentic Thai with friendly service and reliably yummy food! Great protein options but sadly no alcohol served. Good pricing though!"}
{"text":"I'm in town for work and I love Thai! I ordered the Pad thai & also the fried rice. NOTE that the lunch dishes come with an egg roll but the dinner portions do not. I ordered delivery to my hotel through grub hub and it was great, I also went in store and the ladies were very nice. 
The mango sticky rice dessert with coconut cream is incredibly delicious.I've gone back for it this week twice! Clean establishment and nice service."}
{"text":"Food was very good, and the service was excellent! This is a small operation, and mostly take out. I think there were three tables for two. We will definitely be back for more in the future."}
{"text":"Thai Basil is the best Thai food in Arizona that I have found so far. I have traveled all over the world and there was only one place that I feel is better. If anyone knows of a better Thai restaurant, please let me know and I will try it out. I really love Thai food. My favorite dish here is the Kang Dang, but I ask for extra juice and I put a little sweetner in it and mix it up. It really brings out the coconut flavor in it. Try it and tell me what you think! Also, the salad dressing is wonderful before your meal. I have gone to their locations in Chandler and this location and the food is the exact same and service is great too!"}
{"text":"Came here on a date (which sucked BTW)  but onto the food. Great atmosphere and friendly fast workers. The food is yummo however if you're into spicy spicy this isn't the place. Overall I'm giving it a 5. I recommend it"}
{"text":"Came here for a late lunch around 1 on a Saturday and it wasn't very busy. 

We got the lunch specials. The yellow Thai curry chicken & the massaman curry with beef brisket. 

Both were quite flavourful with more sweetness than spiciness which is what I look for as I'm not a big fan of spicy food. 

I think I preferred the massaman curry over the yellow curry because of the extra sweetness of the massaman. 

Overall would recommend giving it a try if you're in the area. The lunch combos are less than $10 and come with Tom yum soup and a spring roll. 

However, it definitely does not compare to pai/Khao San road and sukho Thai."}
{"text":"Spicy noodles were delish. 
Service was great 
food is out fast what more can you want? 
perfect place for lunch with friends (:"}
{"text":"I really liked this place. My entree was very good , and the staff was attentive. I ordered Thai hot , and it was very spicy.  Nice place to go to, if your in the area."}
{"text":"Good food. Decent Prices. Great customer Service. What more can you really ask for? 

While the location and parking situation may not be ideal for this place, it was not enough to discourage me from taking part in all the wonderful food that Thai Basil had to offer.

From curry to tofu pad thai, your options are only limited by your imagination. I visited this location with a couple of friends and was enamored by the variety of flavors and pairings that were offered. The duck with red curry was absolutely phenomenal. So was the panang curry and pad thai. You can completely customize your order with a protein of your choice (tofu, chicken, beef) and a varied level of spice (medium is spicier than I thought it would be! be careful!) 

With every bite I could taste the crisp freshness of every ingredient and flavorful sauces to boot. The portions here are large so if you aren't supremely hungry upon entry, you are sure to go home with some left overs.

The food came out quick and was amazingly flavorful. I can't wait to try some other things off of this amazing menu the next time i'm in town!"}
{"text":"Came in for lunch with the wife. I'm not one to try something new and we saw it passing by. I was surprised how good the food is (pad Thai with beef). I will return again next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"I always get my order to go so it's ready in the box, but I found out to get it for here still because you get a delicious salad with it if you are dining in!

I order the beef pad see ew and though it is not the best I have had, it is still good. I hear a lot of people ordered the chicken pad thai, so I will have to give that a try!"}
{"text":"Thai Basil is a great place. Perfect for a college student who loves Thai. The menu is pretty basic and with fair prices. The servers and workers are wonderful. Very quick service.  I'd recommend anything here."}
{"text":"Overall - 3.5/5.0

My favourite uptown spot for Thai curry dishes. Also can't go wrong with the BBQ Pork Neck appetizer! Service is also quick and courteous. The decor is also classy with various Thai elements and low lighting.

Haven't tried any of the other rice or noodle dishes so I cannot vouch for it. Some folks may find their curry portions a bit small but I find it just great if you couple it with an appetizer or two."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat with so many great items to chose from. The mongolian beef is one of the best tasting dishes and the heat is just right. I love their thai spring rolls dipped in a warm peanut sauce. Also the sushi was pretty darn good.

 I really love this place and the staff was friendly and great customer service. If you want a good variety of asian food then you will definitely like Thai Basil. This is one of the best restaurants in North Las Vegas and you will be impressed with their food that will keep you coming back for more."}
{"text":"They still can't figure out their pricing. I always order the same thing, pad woon sen, no meat Extra noodles. Sometimes it's $11, sometimes $12, today $13. Same dish, same time, different price.

If the dish cost $11 dollars with your choice of tofu, chicken or beef, then substituting extra noodles in place of meat should cost nothing. Sometimes they understand, others times $1 extra, next time $2 extra (plus sales tax). 

But you can't expect foreigner Asians to understand that. In their culture, apparently you can charge new prices on the fly for the same dish. 

The dish is good, but sorry, $14 is too much for lunch. They also seem to have trouble keeping staff, as there is nearly always someone new there. And, they exclusively hire Asians. I like Asians, but where's the love for everyone else?"}
{"text":"I got the Drunken Noodles, Chicken Pot Stickers, Crab Rangoons, and Mango Curry with Shrimp. All of it flavorful and delicious. There could be more shrimp in the mango curry (counted 2) - for the price that was kind of outrageous - and Drunken Noodles could be less greasy, but was still tasty. Nothing was too spicy on the palate, my nose was running from the heat, but it I wouldn't say it was too hot to eat at all!"}
{"text":"RUDE hostess. My friends and I visited after 9 pm on the weekend. There were many available tables around, but she put us at a small, poorly located table. We politely asked for a better table and she snapped at us and told us we should have considered making reservations. It was late and the restaurant had a lot of empty tables. We never got a better table. I did not record her name, but she was chubby and wore a lot of make up. Horrible service!!!!!"}
{"text":"Good Pad Thai! Throw alittle soy sauce on it even better Pad Thai. Good service. The server always twist my arm to do Saki bombs."}
{"text":"Yes, Pad C U twice in a week/???  I'm all up for it!!
Usually I eat homemade lunch, but this week has seen my out and about with all sorts of work to do...
So, I've been to the Tempe location of this restaurant and it rivaled Touch of Thai at Bell/35th Ave for my favorite Thai place in the Valley, though none have even come close to the places back in Chicago.
Solid, solid, solid-you get a small salad as you sit down and I ordered Pad C U and a Thai iced coffee.  The coffee was sweeter than I remembered but the Pad C U was quite good.  More significant 'gravy' than Thai House in Scottsdale and just delicious.  Cheaper too even though they're downtown!"}
{"text":"I always come here when I want great service and great food.  I've been a long time customer and Thai Basil always comes through.  The staff know us and always anticipate our needs. What more could you ask for?  Thank you for making my mothers birthday special for my family and for another awesome dinner!"}
{"text":"Just picked up lunch... before I started eating I noticed brown old basil leaves in my rice. I pulled the out hoping it was just an oversight. Then tried. Taste of rice is horrible! I ordered Thai spicy fried rice w/chicken. It has a fishy and rotten chicken taste! Yes, rotten!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite thai restaurant at arizona. I'm from california and i always go back here every year to eat,yellow curry is very good and they have friendly staff and service is great! Thank you"}
{"text":"The green curry is the best. Will definitely come again."}
{"text":"Very fresh vegetables and really tasty chunks of white meat chicken were found in the dish I ordered - the namesake Thai basil. Glad I branched out from the usual pad Thai because the garlic sauce on this dish was boldly flavored and still prepared mild for me as requested. Huge chunks of onions and broccoli really elevated the dish and the rice was great touch on the side for free. I have my eye on the peanut sauce and the curry for the next visit. Open til 10pm and free parking is great since I really can't pay to park and get take-out on Mill, it just doesn't seem right. Very nice staff too."}
{"text":"I really like their spicy noodle, I order it each time.
It's spicy with wonderful flavor and cook perfectly, but I hope they increase the meat portion."}
{"text":"Really good, lots of flavor, decent service, nice restaurant. Slightly expensive for thai food but worth it always solid."}
{"text":"I've been going to this place for over 5 years now. The food is really good and the green basil chicken/shrimp is to die for. Very yummy and good for you. I've tried many of the other dishes and they are spectacular as well.

The ambiance is really nice and romantic in the evening when they dim the lights."}
{"text":"Since moving from Seattle a few months ago my family and I have been in search of a new Thai restauRant. The pad Thai was the best we've ever had and the mussamun curry was fabulous. We will definitely be back again!!!"}
{"text":"Staff is always friendly and we get seated quickly. Every dish is very good. 
This visit reviews:
green chicken curry - good spicy curry flavor. Sauce was very thick. 
vegetable sushi roll - everything was good about it
miso soup - great
pineapple curry - sweet, curry flavor. Sauce was very thick as well
chicken teriyaki bento box - good, not great. Vegetable tempura had a hint of moldy flavor 
California roll - fresh rice, good crab 
spicy tuna roll - fresh, very good roll"}
{"text":"Been here a couple times and always had a very enjoyable experience. I've never had an issue with service here. The servers are polite, attentive and very friendly. 

I love starting off with the cold fresh rolls either with chicken or mango. When I go with groups of 3 or more we order plates to share. Typically, we get a curry dish, a rice or noodle dish, and a veg dish. This is a good amount of food for 2-3 people. I would absolutely recommend the Penang curry with chicken and the basil chilli eggplant with tofu (or something like that) which you can request with less spice. Just a heads up that the rice is an additional cost and doesn't come with any of the curry dishes. Their dishes are reasonably priced and pretty on par with other Thai restaurants, approx $10-12 per dish."}
{"text":"Attention vegetarians - this is for you.  This review is specifically for vegetarian food that we got as take-out.  My experience eating in at Thai Basil has always been great and I recommend it highly.  But, take out was a little more disappointing.

To their credit, the folks at Thai basil know what vegetarian means, which is a big plus.  Many Thai restaurants will insist that a dish is veggie, but still use fish sauce.  These guys, at our request, removed all the fish sauce and helped us navigate what dishes we could safely order.

All curries and soups are off the table here if you are a veg.  We ordered thai basil eggplant and tofu, a crispy chilli tofu dish, a mango salad and vegetables in black bean sauce.  Overall, the food was okay, but not great.  The veggies were a bit limp and the sauces were understated.  The chilli tofu I found a bit watery.  I really liked the crispy garlic in the mango salad, but it was warm because it sat in the bag with the hot food, so lost its freshness.  You might have more luck with a noodle dish - we didn't order one.

Overall, not a bad place to get Thai takeout.  We felt confident that the food was indeed vegetarian, which was a big plus.  But it's not nearly as good as take-out as it is to dine in.

Vegetarian score: 6.5/10"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place and would highly recommend! The service is great and it never is that packed, so it's never too loud. The atmosphere is great!

I always come here for lunch when I'm in the area as their lunch combos are amazing! The main dish comes with a side of tom yum soup and a springroll. The tom yum soup is one of the best that I've ever had. The price is also very reasonable! I usually get the Pad Thai with chicken as that is my favourite thai dish. However, the green curry chicken and cashew chicken are also very delicious!

Overall, one of my favourite thai places in Toronto."}
{"text":"This place had great food. People were nice and the service was fast. It looks really cosy and fresh inside. I grabbed the combo for two which includes mango salad, vegetarian spring rolls, green curry chicken, veggies in black bean sauce & steamed rice and it was spicy and damn good. I also ordered some ginger green tea healthy drink it was hard to swallow. On the positive note, I had so much food I had to pack the rest to go and enjoy left overs!"}
{"text":"The food was fresh, flavorful and had a nice variety of menu options. The ambiance was simple and Thai. Our server gave us excellent recommendations for appetizers, entrees and desert. We really enjoyed our dinner! We will be back.

A solid 5 stars!"}
{"text":"We had a great meal here. The place was packed! The servers were slow initially BUT it was packed and once we were seated, the service was fine. Tons of vegetarian options. The food was well spiced and the portions were sufficient.

I would visit again. 5 stars!"}
{"text":"I ordered the Pad See Ew with chicken but it was pretty plain in comparison to other Thai places in the valley. However, the service was great and the way the inside is decorated is very beautiful!

Also, the Thai Tea comes in an extremely tall glass, I was very surprised by the size. Lastly, prices here are pretty much the same as other Thai places."}
{"text":"I've enjoyed a few meals at this establishment over the last 2 years. It is easy to find, clean, priced well and fast. The clientele during lunch is predominantly local office workers. The ambiance is nice, they are friendly and the food is good.

I would recommend this establishment to family & friends."}
{"text":"Came here with my MIL, hubby and kids. Staff was very attentive, even tho we didn't order right away (waiting for MIL). It appears to be a very clean restaurant and nice lighting for a romantic dinner. 

Now for the food. We started off with a combination appetizer. It was delicious! I've had better peanut sauce, but other than that it was very tasty. We ordered silver noodle soup with tofu and all shared as an appetizer, omg, so so so good!!! MIL got the green curry with shrimp and said it was very good. My kids ordered the Thai fried rice with brown rice and chicken, they loved it. I ordered the chili vegetable platter spicy. Very good, lots of veggies and it was nice and hot. My husband got some grilled fish platter, it came with shrimp and scallops, he was a little confused that the scallops were raw, but loves sushi so it was ok. 

Overall, I would say we had a very yummy dinner and will be back."}
{"text":"This is a great take out place. If you are craving for spicy Thai food, this is the place to go. I have ordered several take out from this place and they don't disappoint. 

Their curries are good. I would recommend their green curry with beef. Pad Thai is great. Make sure u specify your spice level when ordering. 5 is really spicy- order only if u know you can handle spicy food. I usually can handle good spice but I order spice level 4 whenever I order here. 

They don't always deliver. Pick up is the best. Give them more time than u think. I once was told 20 mins and they let me wait 10 more mins after that. They can be pretty busy depending on day of week."}
{"text":"Besides it's easy access location from where I live, Thai Basil has the nicest people working here! They take the time to explain and answer whatever questions we had concerning the menu and even the ingredients of sriacha, the history of the use of thai chilis, and even the meaning to life (well, not really... haha!)!

The first time I ate food from Thai Basil, was for take out and I found the food sitting on my kitchen counter. I flipped the lid and chowed down. I asked where the food was from and found out it was from Thai Basil. I destroyed their pad thai! I made it a point to come to the restaurant someday soon!

...And that day came when we decided to celebrate my mom's birthday at her favorite Thai spot. Authenticity may be in question, but regardless of that detail, the food was very tasty and came out piping hot and... the rarest thing in a lot of restaurants nowadays: a smile! We ordered a gang of food to celebrate:

Panang fish-- Deep fried fish filets in panang curry with a hint of coconut milk. Delicious and packs kicks and punches if you're generous with those cute tiny Thai chilis.

Eggplant beef-- I'm not a huge fan of eggplant, but the way this dish is prepared makes me a believer that eggplant is supposed to be edible. lol!

Pad Sew Ew Chicken-- Not too bad. Not too great. It makes me think if cooks hide flavor with spice. Hmm. I hope that's not the case here.

Although Thai Basil isn't on my top list of Thai spots here in Vegas, I'll go back as a family past time because my mom likes it and it's near the house. I do find it kind of odd that Thai Basil serves all kinds of Asian food, but it definitely isn't the first (Asians love to do that!) This place is definitely one I'd love to discover there specialties at."}
{"text":"Like other reviewers, I get carry-out from here at least once a month. The curries last for multiple meals and are fantastic. I'm also a sucker for the Thai iced teas."}
{"text":"I really like Thai Basil. If you have never tried Thai food, I highly recommend - the quality is very consistent here. I have been here multiple times (both for dine-in and takeout) and the food always comes out very fast. The chicken pad thai (medium) is my favorite and I get it almost every time. The Thai Basil, their signature dish, is also delicious and has lots of fresh veggies. My only complaint is they do not use cilantro or lime in their pad thai, which I think is pretty standard for pad thai, and which I do miss (I asked for a lime once, and they said they don't have any! strange for a thai place, no?). However, when I order takeout that isn't an issue for me, since I usually have those things at home and I can add them myself :) 

If you're looking for a scrummy treat, try the Thai Iced coffee. It is to die for! Mmmm."}
{"text":"The best Thai food I've ever had. This is the only restaurant that I order something different every time I go and it never fails me. I've tried almost everything! For an appetizer, I always get the fresh spring rolls (with rice paper, not fried) with tofu and smother it in the peanut sauce it comes with. I always order my dishes with tofu and with Thai hot heat level which I love. You can customize your dish with protein and spice, everything else is fresh veggies with rice or noodles. The service is lightning fast and really lovely. It's intimate but casual dining and there is no shortage of flavor. I've never had to wait for a table and I always leave full. The staff is kind!! This is my favorite restaurant in Tempe, it's a must try."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good and quick for lunch. After you sit down, you get a salad and then you can order from the menu. I get the Thai basil meal with seafood and it's wonderful with vegetables and rice. I don't think this place is open for dinner."}
{"text":"I love sushi so this place is a good place they dont have ayce but they have decent rolls at a good price I best time to go is during lunch hours cuz sushi is half price!!! Mmmm the who's ur daddy is a good roll I always order it because my husband isn't a lover of sushi but that seems to be the o.ly roll he will eat from there! We go on a regular or about 1 every few months n every time service is great its a small hole in wall so u never get treated like ur a nobody:)"}
{"text":"This place was alright. I would go again. I ate the pineapple fried rice and had some calamari. Another time I had sushi, which was sub par but not terrible."}
{"text":"Amazing service & food. My husband doesn't really like any type of Asian food but he really liked this place which is great for us since kids & I love it . Very clean and great service. Our waiter kept checking on without being annoying lol. It's pretty hidden behind the main building on Ann rd but We will absolutely be back."}
{"text":"Favorite Thai spot for sure. Great curry dishes, fresh vegetables and a relaxing atmosphere. Great hangover food and cheap lunch specials!"}
{"text":"i've never eaten bad food from thai basil. if you're looking to try thai food for the first time or if you just enjoy flavorful, thai dishes then look no further. i'm not a huge curry fan, but the panang here is one of my favorite dishes on the menu."}
{"text":"I have eaten at Thai Basil several times although never actually dined in until last night. The food is flavorful and the service is great. They do not serve alcohol but the quality of fresh food served and the costumer service provided is worth the visit. Thai Basil is a little restaurant with casual, clean atmosphere. Highly recommend this place when you're in a mood for Thai food."}
{"text":"Excellent! Our waitress was very pleasant. She was the daughter of the owner. She knew the menu very well and provided excellent suggestions. I had the honey pork which was offered as a suggestion by our waitress. It was an unusual Thai dish to find on menu but was assured to be an authentic dish found in Thailand by our waitress. You can choose the spice level for all meals. I ordered it medium spicy and could have used a little more heat. I do like my food spicy though!"}
{"text":"Very decent hole-in-the-wall place. It wasn't very busy so it worked out for me. Food came in timely. 

I'm pretty sure this is my first time having Sushi and Thai food paired together, two things I love. 

I ordered the Manhattan Roll that I found at the bottom of the Happy Hour that I basically ordered for my appetizer, it wasn't bad, it tasted just as I'd expect it to from what my waiter described. 

I then ordered a Thai Green Curry with Chicken. I wanted to add it came with a bottom lamp warmer to keep the curry warm that works out for people who eat just as slow as I do. The curry was, slightly bland from the curries in used to enjoying, *however I did have Chinese Eggplant added into it so that may have thrown the house recipe off. A good number of times the meat in curry is over cooked, this wasn't the case. The chicken was very nice and tender. 

The last thing I ordered was Beef Pad Thai. It was delicious, very saucy & good portion. The peanuts are lightly crushed so there's bigger chunks and garnished generously with cilantro.

My waiter was friendly and attentive even as it got busy soon after."}
{"text":"Amazing Thai tea. They were very accommodating to me as a vegan. I was able to order Thai tea with coconut milk. I ordered some tofu and veggies dish. Outstanding service."}
{"text":"We went here for lunch on a Friday.  We were seated quickly and the eating area is clean.
Our waitress was very friendly and was working the lunch crowd (impressively) alone.
Service is 5 star for sure.
We ordered peanut curry, pad thai, and dumplings.
Like some of the other reviews, they were a little light with the spice.  The pad thai was mostly sweet, but still good.
The peanut curry was also a lighter version of 'spicy' but still good as well.
The dumplings....were just ok, and The rice was instant?  Something weird.
Overall, minus the rice thing, great lunch place, with excellent service, and affordable too.

They had several lunch specials and our bill was less than 20$, incl. the appetizer."}
{"text":"Great fried rice, great noodles (all of them, and very friendly staff that doesn't keep you waiting. Perfect for lunch, only 10 including tip for a tasty meal and quick service."}
{"text":"Another run-of-the mill Americanized Thai restaurant that seems to be the norm around AZ.  Rubbery meats, American broccoli, boring carrots and zucchini. No spice factor, few herbs and fish sauces, no authentic dishes, or dishes done authentically. Where's the roasted duck red curry, larb salads, Asian/Thai vegetables, whole-fried fish, papaya salad with blue crab? Oh, I forgot I'm in Central Phoenix. Geeze, I'm such a food snob. If ya'll think this is good, your mouth will MELT when you get the real stuff.  On the plus side, it's a nice, small restaurant and was very busy at lunch. To-go orders don't get the house salad they serve but you do get a little eggroll wrapped in foil.

My search for  true Phoenician Thai food with bold, complex flavors continues.  Any leads would be greatly appreciated."}
{"text":"Do you have Thai-me to hear about my neighborhood Thai restaurant? I come here on a regular basis and order my favorites: Chicken Phad Thai and Panang Curry! We also got chicken Fried Rice this time. If you're in the mood for Thai and are in the area, Thai Basil is a safe bet! I've almost always had a good experience with quick service and attentive staff! If you're in the mood to try a curry try the Panang curry! It's sweet yet spicy and goes great over a side of rice. All the dishes we ordered came with cooked veggies mixed in including carrots, red pepper, green beans, broccoli, and much more! 

Date night or just eating for 2? Try my personal twist:  My partner and I always order the Chicken Phad Thai and Panang curry. We put the Phad Thai over a bed of rice and drizzle the curry on top for extra flavor. It's my favorite combo and only about $24 after tip! You'll have plenty of left overs. 

Great date place or for just a night on the town. They also have a decent selection of beers and other favorite drinks! 

Overall a great place to cure that Thai craving!"}
{"text":"Love this place it is some of the best Thai food in the neighborhood the staff are friendly helpful and quick. The price is really good for the portion size in my opinion and I highly recommend this place to anyone looking to get a quick casual bite that isn't fast food or chili's across the street."}
{"text":"There are times when a place if business is exactly what it appears to be and our meal at Thai Basil was one if them. Pleasant affordable good food with a helpful waiter. It deserves the 3 & 1/2 Yelp stars. A great place for a good quick meal when you are new in town."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever at a restaurant. Their food is average however the way they run their business is awful. We were a party of four and ordered one appetite(~$8), four dishes (~$12 each)and four desserts(~$6 each). I expected the bill to be around $80 before tax. To my amazement, the bill came at $120 with no details. Puzzled I asked the waiter for an itemize bill. When the bill came again, two things struck me: 1.) it went from $120 to $110; 2.) a gratuity was already included. Mind you, we were only a party of four and the last time I checked it was only customary to add gratuity for a party of 6 or more.  The worst part was the service we received was the very minimum and service people were close to being rude. With the difference in the bill their only comment was math is never my strong suit. Really? That's how you run a business? Needless to say, I will never go back to a place where it is run with no business ethics."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch to break a two day fast due to a medical procedure.
A fresh salad with a peanut sauce dressing was brought by the server only seconds after being seated. The peanut sauce dressing was excellent and complimented the greens nicely.
I ordered the House Seafood Special which was a large portion of mixed seafood in a very light and flavorful sauce. I ordered medium spicy but it was still pretty tame.
For dessert I had the fresh mango with sticky rice that had been simmered in coconut milk.
This was OMG good and perfect on a hot Phoenix afternoon.
If you want authentic Thai you might be disappointed but otherwise Thai Basil delivers a very nice Asian experience. The Thai coffee is also pretty good...I had two!"}
{"text":"Very good neighborhood restaurant.  Good fair prices for good Thai food.  Curry shrimp is excelkents.  Portions are great.   Should be rated better than three stars."}
{"text":"Thai obsessed. Chicken Panang Curry, Pad Thai and Pad See Ew are great. I love getting take out."}
{"text":"Love the green curry & pad Thai here. I ordered medium spicy next time I'll go for hot. My wife and I like Thai food with a kick. My togo order was accurate and ready. It was 15 min before closing and the staff didn't make me feel rushed at all."}
{"text":"Normally, I couldn't eat Thai food because of its smell. 
However, this place brought me to a whole new world. 
I can't deny that the food was slightly americanized. but that's the good part for me. :)  

You will love their crunch egg role and Pho thai. Wanna.. grab it again. :D"}
{"text":"Food is just average, service is fine.  Ambience is good.  But this place is overpriced.  Obviously they target couples for fancy thai food.  Only decor is good and food is not good enough for the price they charge. 

Will not return."}
{"text":"I wanted some Thai food as my last dinner here in AZ and decided to make my way here. I was seated immediately and asked by the waitress about my experience with Thai food. I told her I loved it and she asked what I typically ordered. She offered guidance in ordering with dishes that may be similar to what I normally get but decided to go with a starter of Chicken Satay and their special for the day Roasted Duck Basil. I appreciate the effort on the part of the waitress to get me food I will like. While waiting for my meal I saw that they have really made the best of the small space with covering part of the window front area with decorations and the ambiance is warm- it's very comfortable and inviting- they keep the temperature cool. Others who have ordered curry have adorable serving pots which lends to a \"sharing\" aspect but also is cute.  I got my Chicken Satay and the meat was cooked and seasoned beautifully and the peanut sauce was sweet and savory. Served with cucumber and onion pickle. VERY GOOD. last time I had Chicken Satay like this I went back the next night (in Puerto Rico) haha! My main dish was very good. I got it in the mild spice range and heat level was what I would expect after requesting. I haven't had duck very often so I don't know if I don't like duck or what. The vegetables where good. Cooked perfectly and the portion is large! I enjoyed myself so much that I decided to only eat half of my meal and go for desert also. It pains me I came here on my last evening. As I wish I could come back for the chicken satay at least once a week. Thanks for a great meal!!"}
{"text":"We stayed at the Hampton Inn nearby and went wandering for lunch.  Stumbled upon this little place and ordered the pad se yu lunch special to go.  It came out pretty fast and was piping hot!  It seemed like your basic standard Americanized Thai food and was pretty good!  The lunch portion was huge!  I was only able to eat half so I saved the other half for another day.  

Also, this place was immaculate and the staff was very friendly while we ordered and waited for our order."}
{"text":"Finally something in Tempe that doesn't think all customers are drunken, poor college students. Not that I'm making fun of them, I was one of them. and when I was I also didn't really care about the quality and overall taste of food.

Thai Basil is fairly small, often cramped, somewhat noisy, but always tasty. They are one of the best in town for tofu dishes.

The curry dishes are also quite tasty. Overall, a great find in Tempe."}
{"text":"This place was WAY more Americanized than I expected from reading the reviews.  It wasn't bad, but it wasn't anywhere close to authentic.  To start with, none of the dishes in their appetizer sampler actually tasted like Thai food.  It was just fried/grilled things with a side of peanut sauce and plum sauce.  I ordered their Pad See Ew, and I don't know if they used different noodles or just didn't cook them long enough, but they were smaller and a different consistency from what Pad See Ew normally is.  I also asked for it medium spicy, which at a Thai restaurant should mean it carries a moderate risk of death.  It was extremely bland; I think I've eaten bacon that was spicier.

So to summarize:  not bad, but not authentic."}
{"text":"Kind of ok. Food doesn't always taste good. Sometimes tastes old. Servers are nice but could be friendlier. Prices are good. I go often because most of the time the food is good."}
{"text":"I found the drunken noodles to be rather bland. I had go so far as to use soy sauce (a cardinal sin) to give them some semblance of flavor. This was after adding additional chilli sauce to them. The waitstaff is very polite and the ambiance is good. It's nothing to write home about, but Thai Basil is a fair lunch option if you don't feel like venturing too far off of campus."}
{"text":"There are two Thai Basil restaurants within two miles of one another. Don't be fooled. This is not the one to go to nor order from. Your meal always comes out wrong and I've gotten sick from food at this location. Twice. Do yourself a favor and keep driving to the one on University rather than this one."}
{"text":"Silver noodle salad takes me to a happy place. They also have amazing daily specials worth being adventurous with - especially if it is a fish dish. Save room for purple sticky rice and custard for dessert."}
{"text":"Wonderful cozy atmosphere and quick service. The Pad Thai and spring rolls were incredible and the price was very decent for the portion and taste. There's not too much to say except that this is an exceptional little restaurant. Will absolutely recommend!"}
{"text":"I ordered the cold rice wraps and pad Thai. Both were not enjoyable at all and the cold rolls were a total rip off. They said there were 4 spring rolls but really there was only 2, cut into 4 pieces. The chicken inside was not just minimal but very bland. The carrots were cut nice though. But then the dressing was too vinegary so it was really just ruined. My friend also got a mango salad that was 10$ and it was literally a cup of mango that wasn't even ripe. Decent taste but not worth it. I also called to ask about the rolls I ordered and the lady was extremely rude and didn't care about my concern."}
{"text":"Nice ambience, courteous staff and good food. I highly recommend their Penang curry. Maybe a little pricier than other restaurants in the neighbourhood, but it's cooking quality might be worth it."}
{"text":"As you walk into Thai Basil, the walls are wonderfully decorated with art work giving the space an authentic, but modern look. With a quick greeting we were sitting at a table (This was before the busy dinner hour of course). The waitress took our drink orders promptly. We ordered a Thai Mojito and a Summer Mango. Both were excellent. For appetizers we had an order of the fish cakes, shrimp rolls and the shrimp crisps. Personal favourite was the rolls.  All three apps were quite good even though I'm not a fan of fish and cakes. Onto the mains was a red curry beef and a green chicken curry. Now I ordered the red curry beef not knowing there were two different dishes. I wanted the beef with jasmine rice, but instead I received a curry beef soup instead. So possibly the wait staff made need to have a clearer representation between the two. The mains were both full of flavour, the curry was a sweet and mild spice with freshly cut vegetables added to the mix. Overall the meal and service was excellent. I would highly recommend this place  for a authentic and delicious Thai experience."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!The Thai food here is as good as any resturant on the strip!I am very discerning about food ......I am from back East.You guys from the southwest are tired of hearing it.....but do this .....go to New York.....Miami, Washington DC ...order Thai food there.....then come back here and order.....you will see the difference......except for Thai Basil.This place is back East quality at it's best.OK.....the green curry shrimp is fantastic.....flavor FLAVOR! The shrimp are LARGE.....not the little ones.The scallop dishes  you will want to keep eating all night long.The scallops are HUGE......full of flavor.Basil calmari.....OMG.....the real deal not compressed and full of breading.Succulent squid breaded lightly!!!!The Thai Basil shrimp is excellent.....with plenty of basil flavor. If you want  EXCELLENT FOOD STOP IN AT THAI BASIL."}
{"text":"Not a lot of people know there is a Thai Basil at the Paradise Valley Mall!  It's a great restaurant with wonderful food and super service.  We enjoy going there for lunch, where for $7.99 you get a small soup or salad, an egg roll and a main course.  Best kept secret at PV mall!"}
{"text":"Fantastic chicken fried rice and pad see ew! My favorite Thai place. Enjoy your meal! The atmosphere is nice."}
{"text":"Please people... stop eating Thai in this city... stop.  Went to this place after checking Yelp, Chowhound, and Blog.to... It's bland, typically overpriced, and ultimately unsatisfying.

Spring Rolls were bland.  Best thing was they weren't oily, but flavour?!

Lemon grass soup - overly sour, not enough balance in the flavour.

Pad Thai - sweet, standard, boring.

Green Curry - good, 3 stars.

Mixed vegetables - decent 2.5 stars.

Was about 20 per person with water, before tip.  Granted a good amount of left over, but sorry... with the exception of Salad King, which really gets it right, for the right price, this place like all these 'top' thai restaurants in the city come at you with McDonaldized flavour at Milestone's pricing...  Blech. I'm exclusively Salad King from now on."}
{"text":"I love Thai cuisine and I want ethnic businesses to succeed, but I must be ill-fated with Thai cuisine. Perhaps it was an off night, but I placed a late (8pm) weeknight takeout order for yellow curry and pad see-u with sticky rice. I paid extra for a larger container of sticky rice only to open it up at home and find two containers of old, chewy plain white rice. I even remember telling the lady taking the order twice that I wanted sticky rice! 
There was no flavor to the pad see-u. Presentation was great, the noodles were brown and oily with a good amount of meat. If they had added just a little bit more sauce, it would have been better. The yellow curry was the highlight of the meal and we ended up sharing that dish. 
The next day, my co-worker ordered takeout for lunch and it smelled amazingly good in the staff room. I asked her if she liked her meal, and she said it's one of her favorite places for lunch. 
I'm still holding out for this place and will give it another shot."}
{"text":"Best Thai in Tempe!

The people are soooo friendly and everything is delicious!  Definitely get the spring rolls, coconut soup, any curry, pad thai, chili garlic veggies... really everything is fantastic!    I could eat their green or peanut curry everyday!

Everything always comes out hot, is fresh, and is consistently amazing!

One tip:  If you order curry, I do think you get more if you order it to-go!"}
{"text":"No free refills on soda. Refills on ice tea. Good food. Nice people. Lots of parking."}
{"text":"Food is cheap and flavorful. I'm a huge fan of its coconut soup and green curry. When I lived in Tempe, the only time I ordered a takeout was from there. We enjoyed the food, and thought Thai food went well with the season finale of Game of Thrones. While we may not want to revisit the scene of the red wedding, we would order food from Thai Basil over and over again. My inlaws also like the food from here! You can select the spicy level, and a medium is tingling but not firey. A great place in the college town."}
{"text":"Best Thai south of Indian School! Very simple and reliable. Fresh, fast, and affordable!"}
{"text":"I was in the area, waiting on some car work to finish up and I had a craving for something spicy. I was not disapointed! Amazing Thai food and fantasic service! 
Staff is friendly and the place is clean. I dont usually eat thai food, but I have always heard how good it is and it comes up because people know I like spicy food.  I got the green curry and it was excellent. It seems to be very authentic but I am far from an expert on thai food. I do know my veggies and spice and the ones they used were very fresh and high quality. I went there bymyself in the late afternoon but I am going to come back with some company to try more. (more plates to sample from)."}
{"text":"Loved this place.  Visited here with my familyOrdered the Satay Chicken, Calamari, Thai Basil Chicken, Thai Iced Tea, Teriyaki Chicken for the kids, Curry for the husband.  Everything was delicious and the service was great.  Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"This restaurant stayed open a few minutes after hours so I could pick up a meal while my wife was hospitalized. I didn't know what to order so they set me up with Thai Basil. 

It was excellent and I have come back a second time with wife;) and enjoyed the meal a second time. 

Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I was craving Thai food today so I decided to try Thai Basil today. I had a really good first impression of the place- very clean, modern decor and a nice quiet restaurant. The lunch specials are now $9.95, so the pictures of the menus on Yelp are innacurate now. I ordered the Pad See Ew with Chicken and the Yellow Curry with Chicken and they were both tasty. I enjoyed the curry more, so I would recommend that dish. The lunch specials also come with Tom Yum soup and a spring roll which is a nice bonus to the meal. It is not the best Thai food I've had but it is definitely good, and worth it for the price you pay. Will satisfy your cravings!"}
{"text":"I used to love this place, but I can't get over their roach problems. Health inspections are public record. Honestly, some of their violations just sicken me to the point that I will never eat here again ... and I eat at some sketchy places in Guangzhou, China several times a year. If a girl who eats chicken stored on the sidewalk won't eat your food, damn."}
{"text":"It wasn't remarkably fabulous but the food was good and the place was packed.  

I'd return."}
{"text":"My usual Thai restaurant stop while traveling for business

Service was good and food came out quickly.  Portion sizes were good for lunch and the prices are on par fo the food.  

Food was alright, not great, not bad.  I had my usual Pad Thai Shrimp spicy and ordered an bowl of Tom Kha Gha (coconut soup).  Lunch meal came with a small eggroll and s slice of watermelon.

I liked the soup because they spiced it up.

I was pretty full for lunch and just by-passed the salad and went for the good stuff.

My only gripe was if you go for lunch, good luck with seating.   The inside is packed and tables are close.  We ended up sitting outside, under a fan and next to a mister from the restaurant next door.  That was a life saver, as you Phoenix is brutally hot at noon.

I would go back."}
{"text":"I dont write too many yelp reviews, and my goal is not to write this and make it sound too negative. My goal is to literately give the owner some business advice.
So last week my sister brought home lunch from Thai Basil. I was so impressed, and did not know that it was literately a minute down the road from our house. I thought wow, why have I never heard of this place before? The food is amazing, and the price is really good. 
Tonight my friends and I decided to go for dinner. The place was a little awkward (ex, a sign in the ladies restroom asking to \"dispose of toilet paper in the trash can\" vs the toilet as if we are in Mexico & the place reaking of bad cleaning chemicals). We were all ordering and I had pointed to something on the menu asking the waiter if it was what I was describing (seeing if it were the same thing my sister had brought home last week). He said yes, that it is. I said okay, I will have that.
Dishes came out one by one in 7-10 minute increments. We awkwardly sat waiting for everyone to get their food. Finally mine comes, (the photo posted seperately is what it is). Literately a dollar store bag of salad with thin chicken strips on top sprinkled with sesame seeds (mind you they wanted $7.99 for this \"salad\"). 
I do not like to make others feel bad, but my friends insisted on me saying something. They said hey, it happens they'll understand just ask to order something else, so I did.
He came back, and I told him I would like to see the menu and order something else because the salad was not what I asked him for and ordered and asked to get it to go since everyone else was done eating I figured ill just eat it at home down the road no big deal.
So he brings the food and the check, no apology or anything and my husband tells him we werent getting the salad. He then instead of apologizing for the inconvenience back fired on my husband with an attitude claiming I had eaten the salad when I just shuffled through it with my fork to see if there was stuff underneath. Again, I already had felt embarrassed ordering something else but he made me feel even worse. He didnt seem to understand english too well, which could of been it but still not reason to treat a customer as he did. I could understand if I were tossing out a plate of noodles & meat, but what he brought me costed them nothing as you can see if you look at the photo.
He ended up taking the charge off but all my years working in customer service and food have I ever not corrected a wrong I had done nor given a customer attitude. 
I will not throw down names, but I highly recommend the owner to talk to the staff, rewrite the menu so it has good descriptions, as well as get rid of that god forbidden plate they call a salad. I now know why they are not a busy place, which sucks because the rest of the food is amazing. 
I may come in for take out here and there, but I will not be dining in nor buying salads.

I give 2 stars just for the food."}
{"text":"I went here once and became addicted. I love the Panang Curry with chicken and have tried each level of spice. I like the medium the best. The servings are very big and I always have extra to take home. I have done take out a few times and the servings are very big for takeout as well. The only negative is they tend to take a long time to bring the check so after your done eating it takes a good 15 minutes to pay."}
{"text":"We had eaten in the restaurant once before but opted to do take out tonight. It was 3.5 stars. Tonight my husband had yellow curry and I had pad see yiu tonight.
Boring, no flavor. Mostly dry noodles. So unsatisfying. We won't be going back."}
{"text":"The food here never disappoints. The egg rolls are the absolute best, and are made fresh...You must wait at least 5 minutes to eat them...They will burn through every taste bud you have...I LOVE IT. We order other food items here and they are second to none, but the egg rolls OMG"}
{"text":"It's so hard to find high quality Asian food in Madison, but Thai Basil has the best Thai food I've had here. If you've had good Thai in cities like San Francisco or New York, you'll be proud of yourself for discovering this place in a tiny city like Madison. The only downside is you can't eat-in; this place is strictly takeout or delivery. However, my mouth is watering just writing this review, and that is not an exaggeration.

We ordered the chicken pad thai and the crab meat fried rice. Both dishes were flavorful, and yes, they use real crab meat in the fried rice. We also tried their crab rangoon. That was creamy on the inside, crispy on the outside, and came with yummy sauce. Try this place out!"}
{"text":"Average food quality. Good price. The waiters love to look at you and talk in their native language, which can be uncomfortable."}
{"text":"Haven't had anything here that wasn't excellent. I've tried the beef satay, Kung Pao chicken, fried rice, and drunken noodles (which were my favorite). Very generous portions for your $. Good service."}
{"text":"Went with business colleagues after work and the place was empty at 7pm just north of downtown.  Seating for only about 30 comfortably inside but there is a patio.  Fried spring roles were a bit dry.  Thai Basil dish with chicken was good and fresh.  Will explore other Thai spots before coming back."}
{"text":"This is probably my must go for Thai food. The service is exceptional and very polite. Their servers are well trained and well manner. Their food quality are average. I enjoy their lunch combo hours from 1130 to 2pm, you can choose one item from the list and the price include the Thai Tom Yum soup and Springroll. Their desserts are well portioned and sharable.  They recently added Khao Soi to their menu, surely check with the server when ordering.  I am so used to visit East York and Downtown Toronto for a decent Thai cuisine experiences but now Thai Basil in Richmond Hill has it all at uptown . The decor and service both are comparably competitive with those in Downtown . The bonus is free parking and a few other chained stores around to shop e.g..Ecco, Global Pet Food, SDM and Starbucks and BBT cafe as well.

I recommend this restaurant in RH for good service Thai food."}
{"text":"So yummy. Love the green curry.  Great for lunch.  Good prices. Great place to grab a quick bite."}
{"text":"I came in, ordered food, sat for 20 mins, and the first thing i got was the receipt?
Btw the food was really good:)"}
{"text":"I love Thai Basil because the portions are great, the service is fast (at least for take-out), and the lunch combos are really good deals. I like their green curry, pad thai, and pretty much all their noodle dishes!  I can't say this is my most favorite thai food place and it has a little bit of a fast-food feel to it but I still really like it."}
{"text":"Very fast service with friendly wait staff, albeit always looking just a little bit stressed out.

Moments after you sit you get a salad with Thai sweet dressing, as well as a menu. Pretty good selection for a small place. Been happy with every dish I've had so far. Fast. Great food. Plentiful portions. My go to spot for lunch."}
{"text":"The Thai Basil Chicken was awesome!!  However, there was a creepy old Asian lady that was crashed out in a booth and she didn't look too healthy:  Not sure what was all about.  Anyway, the table was wobbly, but the food was great & I shall return."}
{"text":"The best Thai we've eaten lately...is not here. Sushi was ok. We stopped here during happy hour so at least the price was decent. On the other hand, we overpaid for everything else so I guess it evened out in the end. The green papaya Salad was so excruciatingly hot it practically ruined our pallettes. The thai beef salad, which was 9 bucks, was the size of a side salad. It was dressed in that really sweet vinegar/sugar dressing and the beef was like leather. Overall, not a good experience.  For Thai from now on we'll just drive to Pam Real Thai on Decatur. The food there is absolutely incredible!"}
{"text":"Really great food here. Service is good during non peak hours. They can be packed and worth the wait. Steve"}
{"text":"I've been here twice with my boyfriend when we had curry cravings.  Normally, I like to go to Mix Zone for curry because they make it as spicy as you want (and I love spicy food), but this place is a lot closer and sometimes when we feel like having curry, it's on a Sunday and sadly, Mix Zone is closed on Sundays.

I've gotten the Panang curry both times. I thought it was pretty good, but I haven't tried it anywhere else before, so I can't compare it with anything.  The only curry I've eaten before Mix Zone's and Thai Basil's is homemade dishes or from a restaurant in Chinatown, NY (I'm Chinese and originally from NJ; my family spends a good amount of time out in NYC).  I don't know what kind of curry was used, but everything I had back on the east coast was definitely prepared differently (while the curry is good out here, I still prefer my dad's).  I thought it was cute that the bowl of curry is served atop a stand which contains a tealight to keep it hot (I uploaded a pic).

So the food was pretty okay.  Not impressed with the service, but it wasn't bad.  They brought me my food and refilled my beverage.  They just didn't do anything exceptional, but I didn't really care as long as we weren't being ignored.  I can't vouch for anything anyone else wrote here, like about the utensils being taken from the pile of dirty dishes.

My experiences here have been okay so far.  We have no reason not to come back.  I only gave them 3 stars because I haven't tried anything else on their menu and their service was okay."}
{"text":"Cross-eyed after an intense essay-writing session, I walked along Bloor looking for some place with table service, a/c, some healthy food, and a pleasant ambiance.  

Thai Basil was busy, but not too busy, so I though I'd give it a try.  Their prices are reasonable, and I ordered the prawn pad thai (so much for the healthy options, but it's my benchmark dish).  

Ho-hum.  The starting salad was chunks of iceberg lettuce in a tasty yellow peanut dressing; surprisingly good.  The salad arrived with what looked like spring roll sweet chili sauce; I decided not to apply it to the salad.

It was rapidly followed by soup and a spring roll (aha!).  The hot and sour soup was so sour and salty it grabbed at the back of my throat - it was flavourful, but not worth the grief, not to mention the sodium intake.  Some cilantro leaves & button mushrooms swam in the broth.

Before I got to the spring roll (nice flavour, quite mushroom-y) my pad thai arrived.  It was the intense orange colour of middle-of-the-road pad thai, but it did come with a lime wedge, a little pile of crushed peanuts, and some spring onion cooked in.  Where's my cilantro?  The noodle texture was nice : delicate, firm, and not gummy.  It may have been due to all the grease.  

Have you ever suspected that Toronto has a city bylaw requiring all shrimp dishes to be served with exactly four shrimp? I can count on one hand the number of times I've seen it raised to five or (bastards) lowered to three.  

Ech.  You can do better, but it's a nice ambiance, and the service was quick."}
{"text":"Ordered Pad Thai & Beef Fried Rice for take out. 

Pad Thai: Bland noodles, not portioned out. Very little beef comparatively. Beef Flavor good when added the Lime.

Fried Rice: Good, but kinda salty. 

Customer Service is good
Overall lacking flavor, don't know if it was bad night or just didn't want to put effort into the food they serve their customers."}
{"text":"This my favorite Thai restaurant because they have bomb green chai tea. I've taken a few friends there and they loved it too. The food is delicious you definitely get what you  pay and so worth it. I highly recommend this place you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time and had the hot and sour soup. It was amazing! Huge portion. Filled with vegetables and great flavor! Great service and fair prices as well. I happened to be in that part of town and the restaurant was suggested. Although I live far from here, I plan on driving back to eat there again!"}
{"text":"I've been to this place a few times trying different dishes. It is by far one of my favorite spots for Thai food. The service is superb and the restaurant is clean. I would highly recommend the Thai Basil (signature dish) or even the chicken pad Thai medium spice. Drinks here are excellent, especially the Thai Iced Tea. 

Do not pass this place up for food. You will love it!"}
{"text":"I came in yesterday, it was very quiet and they have enough shade inside the restaurant so I imagine in the summer it doesn't get too hot inside the restaurant.

Our waitress who was the chef's/cook's daughter was really pleasant to speak to. She spoke well and was just very friendly but not over the top.

I ordered a medium tofu pad Thai and \"fresh rolls\" which were spring rolls. My mom ordered beef fried rice. It was all really great and came out very quickly.

My only issue was my nephew's  water cup had a lip stain on it. I wiped it off with a napkin. Other than that I enjoyed my time here."}
{"text":"Picking a dinner date with my friend, we agree on Thai Basil. Although there is another one closer to my house, he insists on coming to this specific one...

... because the server there is hot. Our criteria for dinner places are a little different.

Fair enough. I come in and look at the HH list while I wait. I notice that all the drink specials went up by $1 and the appetizers also increased in prizes. Much to my surprise, I pull up some old reviews that told me about the awesome $2 Blue Moon and other treats and wonder if its a typo. Unfortunately the business needed to raise their prices to be more cost effective and so the great value on their HH pretty much went away.

I go ahead and order the Crying Tiger: a large piece of grilled beef (sliced) served with steamed veggies (carrots, broccoli, zucchini) and a side spicy sauce. Like everyone says, the veggies are cooked really well here- not soft and flaccid but with tons of fresh flavor and crunch. The sauce was extremely spicy (hence the crying tiger!) and the beef was cooked well. The dish was all-in-all good but nothing to rave about. It is also listed as a HH special at $8.50 but my bill came out to about $11 + tip, so there is either a $3 tax that I forgot about or I didn't get charged the HH pricing.

My friend ordered the green chicken curry at Hot (not Thai Hot). The heat level was great but the curry sauce was very thin and lacked spice (not heat- SPICE, as thai spices mixed-in to give the curry flavor and complexity). Definitely an A-OK meal, but nothing particularly authentic.

But at least my friend was right about the hot server..."}
{"text":"If it was financially possible for me to eat at Thai Basil four times a week, I would, without a doubt.

I will admit that I am not very well versed in Thai food, so I can't comment on whether or not this is authentic. What I can comment on, however, is that it is FREAKIN' DELICIOUS. 

I have been to three of the Thai Basil Locations: The one on University (next to Tops Liquor), this one (next to McDonald's on Rural), and the one on Baseline (on the south side of the street). The food has been consistently delicious at all three. The employees are always, always, always friendly. I haven't received anything less than excellent service.

Most recently, we tried the cheese/shrimp egg roll appetizer things (I honestly can't tell you what it was called) -- but holy tastiness, Batman! My boyfriend and I were both really glad that we ordered this.

The Chai Green tea is excellent too. Really refreshing, unsweetened, lots of flavor. Mmm mm mm.

But for me, this place is ALL ABOUT the curry. If you try the red curry (mild for me) or the massman (aka: \"sweet nut\" -- also mild) curry, you will not be disappointed. The red curry comes with your choice of meat/tofu (we always spring for the mixed seafood: scallops, shrimp, calamari) and has a variety of veggies in it too. Yummo.

The massman curry comes with meat/tofu, carrots, potato, and onion slices. The flavor is downright incredible. I don't think I could choose a favorite between the red curry and the massaman curry, but I think I crave the massman curry more (if that makes any sense).

The lunch portions are a nice size, maybe on the small size for some people, but they are perfect for me. At dinner, I always have to get a to go box.

I do recommend ordering dinner for pick up from Thai Basil. The curry comes in this GIGANTIC plastic container, and you get a nice side of rice. And, bonus, the curry container is reusable and can be heated in the microwave. I am beginning to have a stockpile of them.

All in all, Thai Basil is a win. I highly recommend it and cannot wait to go back."}
{"text":"Quick service and ample seating, even on a busy friday night. I had the pad thai - it was a bit saucy, but still delicious. Ginger lemon tea is fantastic, and must be sampled."}
{"text":"I love ordering their food Thai-Hot (thats the hottest you can get here). If you like you're food spicy, you can't go wrong. Their pre-meal salads; which come with every dine-in meal, has an awesome salad dressing. They also sell their salad dressing for ($5) to take home. I forget how many oz. they said it was. I think its close to 12 or 16, but don't quote me on it. Every meal seems to come with a slice of fresh cut watermellon.  The watermellon is a nice refreshing pre or post meal snack and also light on the added calories; although the rest of the meal may not be.

My favorite dish is their garlic dish; either rice or noodle, ive had it with chicken and tofu before. The tofu is prepared in such a way that it has a crispy outside and a buttery inside. I don't think that I've ever ordered a tofu dish before and thought \"I might order this again some time.\" 

Their lunch meals will cost you about $10-$11 after tax + tip, so I don't visit all the time, but they are a great choice if you can't stop thinking about thai food and you're in the midtown area near central ave and thomas."}
{"text":"This place is by far my favourite Thai restaurant in Richmond Hill. Its use of spices make each dish unique and flavourful. My favourite dishes are its Banyan Shrimp Rolls, Thai Green Curry and Mango Sticky Rice. If you give these dishes a try, I assure you that you would not be disappointed.

Banyan Shrimp Rolls ($7.95):

Thai Basil's Shrimp Rolls are fried to perfection. The crispy rolls consist of minced shrimp and ham. A generous dip in the plum sauce along with a squeeze of lime bring a sweet and tangy flavour to the rolls. Unfortunately, it only comes with four pieces, leaving you wanting for more as you eat your last bite. 

Thai Green Curry with Chicken ($10.95):

Thai Basil's Green Curry is rich and silky smooth in texture. It has a strong coconut flavour and a tolerable level of spiciness. The green curry includes eggplant, red pepper, lime leaves and basil leaves, which together enhances the overall appeal and flavour of the dish. A good pairing with the green curry is Thai Basil's Baked Fried Rice in Young Coconut ($13.95).

Mango Sticky Rice ($6.95): 

Its black and white sticky rice is drizzled with a generous layer of coconut milk. If you are a fan of sweets, this dessert is a must try. The sliced mangoes compliment the sweetness of the rice and milk. It is a great final addition to your meal.

On top of everything that I mentioned, the customer service and décor are both amazing!"}
{"text":"I have been ordering from Thai Basil for about 4 years now... and it continues to be some of the BEST Thai food I have ever had.   I travel a great deal, and I always search for a Thai restaurant.... and no one compares to Thai Basil. Great staff, but really excellent, full flavored food.   I ALWAYS get the Squid Salad which is fantastic... and the Tom Yum is amazing.... the salad rolls... and the Pad Thai with shrimp.  So good!!    I spend my winters in AZ.. and my summers in Madison... and I always make sure I find a place to stay within their delivery range.  I order from Thai Basil every Sunday night !   Highly recommended Thai Food.... delicious!  And the owner is a hoot!!    You can't go wrong!!"}
{"text":"I was let down. Prices were decent, that was the only upside.
I ordered the drunken noodles, they were slightly different to the drunken noodles I have had at other Thai restaurants in the past. I noticed there were no tomatoes, I've never had drunken noodles without tomatoes! 
The whole selection of Thai food in general was lacking, I didn't see any pad woon sen, squash curry, or red curry.
The reason I love Thai restaurants is because the selection and flavors have a lot more to offer than a typical Chinese restaurant.. Honestly though, this place reminded me of a cheap Chinese food restaurant.. Or worse I'd say it was almost as bad as a Panda Express.
I really didn't feel like I was eating authentic Thai food and that was what I was looking for. I think because they offered sushi along with Chinese, it made it not as great.
Ill try and find a Thai restaurant that just focuses in on Thai food.."}
{"text":"First time at this Thai Basil. Been to three other locations. I arrived at 11:20 on a Wednesday morning and there were 10 full tables and 30 empty ones. 

After I was seated, I was immediately brought a cup of cabbage/onion soup. Even tho it was hot outside, the scallions and cilantro kept it light and refreshing. 

I ordered an iced tea, shrimp Pad Thai and crab puffs, which came to $19.30 plus tip. 

The six puffs came in three mins and I don't think there was crab in the puffs but since it wasn't on the lunch menu, I don't know it they were supposed to. They were light, crispy and full of cream cheese. The lunch came 5 mins later. 

The Pad Thai arrived with a small veggie egg roll plus a dipping sauce. The main dish also had marinated tofu, along with the five shrimp. The scallions and carrots were artfully cut and the sauce was classically made. The peanuts were weird, cuz they seemed 'moist' rather than chopped or crushed. Adding in the noodles, bean sprouts, scrambled egg and white onion, there was more than I could eat. Good dish, if lacking shrimp."}
{"text":"Had such high expectations as its just blocks from our condo
In a big plaza with starbucks so plenty of parking.
Outdoor patio and inside seats as well.

Got here on a Saturday afternoon at 2 pm. They gave us the lunch special menu. Very good pricing. 
Tofu, chicken, beef or pork dishes are $7.95 and shrimp dishes are $9.95.

Salad comes with each order and the dressing is good.  Apparently so good that people want to buy it so it's on their menu as a side for $5? 
Other sides included hot sauce and different sauces. No actual sides like Tom yum soup or chicken satay or papaya salad.  I did notice they have those on their dinner menu but we weren't given that menu.

It's nice they have Saturday lunch special till 3pm but I guess I found the menu limited.

Food was Bland so the pepper and hot sauce tray came in handy.  The thai basil signature dish is Rice and sautéed vegetables. Hubby got it with shrimp but didn't enjoy it.  My red curry which I was so excited about was runny and not enough flavor. She didn't ask if we wanted hot, thai hot or medium hot and I forgot to say so I guess we just got regular?

I think this is a swing and a miss.  Might try once more for dinner and get their pad thai and papaya salad. That's how I usually judge a thai restaurant.

The server barely spoke to us...maybe lack of English. Just blah."}
{"text":"Fantastic food. Great environment and pleasant service. Came for lunch and got an amazing yellow curry FOR LESS THAN 10$ Really enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Definitely one of the better Thai options in the Valley.  This place is small and pretty casual - but they do have nice touches like carved wood decor inside.  Got a green papaya salad with grilled prawns and a chicken satay.  The satay was perfect.  The salad was also tasty.  The Thai tea was the ideal accompaniment.  And afterward I could not resist the sticky rice with mango - which was fantastic.  Prices were reasonable, too.  I'll for sure be back.  The location is quite convenient, including a huge parking lot."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times while working in the area.
I was there again with a lovely friend of mine and we had a wonderful meal together!
We ordered the Panang green curry which was awesome flavorful and uncomplicated!!

We shared as well as an order of pad Thai ...a standard but very enjoyable . The noodles tasted fresh and it's sweet and savory combination were right on target!!
It was very busy and the service was a little rushed ...but all in all quite good.

I am not disappointed. My palate and appetite for wonderful food was quite pleasantly satiated !! Yummmm

As a nice little side benefit I quite like the decor with all the Barnwood. I also love The earthenware upon which the meals are served, 
Dessert deserves an honorable mention here !!
I  strongly  recommend that you order the mango sticky rice as I would go back there just for that!!

Oh no .... You will not be disappointed in Thai Basil!!"}
{"text":"The pad Thai is just as good as everyone says. I wasn't huge on the drunken noodles, but I haven't had it anywhere for comparison. I definitely recommend stopping in for takeout."}
{"text":"This place was really good, I was surprised. I got Pad See Ew made with beef instead of chicken (+ 1$). I really liked the combination of tofu and beef (surprisingly) and the sauce was subtle but really good. We also got shrimp chips, and I'm not a huge fan of seafood but they surprised me - I still ate a lot of them. My bf got pineapple rice. It came inside a pineapple which was super fun and the flavours went so well together, it was super pineapple-y and it came with raisins which was a great combination. It was so flavourful it made me realize how white I am. Would recommend."}
{"text":"I love coming to this place. I've been here a couple of times and the food quality is still at top notch! I love their lunch specials. It comes with spring roll and soup, their spring roll is always crispy and their soup had a kick of spice which I love. 

I normally get their pad Thai - chicken! I have yet to try their dessert, it always looks so good! My only complain is that their portion is a little bit small for me!"}
{"text":"Thai Basil is in the heart of the Annex and is a pretty decent Thai restaurant.  I ordered the pad thai noodles with prawns which is an ok option but nothing spectacular.  It was a decent portion size and had good flavours.  My friend ordered the red curry beef which had a spicy rating of 2 which indicates medium spicy. She didn't think it was that spicy but I guess that depends on your tolerance levels.  The service was ok and the prices are quite cheap for the area.  I would recommend trying Thai Basil."}
{"text":"First time at this Thai Basil. Been to four others across the valley. 

I arrived at 11:15 on a Tuesday and there were 8 other parties (about 1/5 full). My lunch arrived quickly, within 7 mins but my ginger salad was delivered faster. The traffic picked up as I ate. 

The service was mostly efficient but I did feel a bit ignored. I think they view lunch as bang, bang get them out concept. 

The meal was fine (standard Pad Thai) but forgettable."}
{"text":"Very good selection of food for meat eaters. But I'm not a meat eater. I requested a vegetarian plate. But they don't do that. They do offer tofu though. Thai tea is great. Great atmosphere. I will come back for the spring rolls. Lol"}
{"text":"I will never spend another dollar at this establishment after how I was treated today. I located Thai Basil's menu online to order dinner. I called the number on their website and a man answered. I told him I wanted to place an order for delivery. He asked me my address, which is about two miles from the restaurant. I placed my order and he told me it would arrive in 15 minutes to one hour. 

I waited an hour and when my food still hadn't arrived, I called the restaurant. The man I spoke to earlier said the delivery person was out sick and it would be an additional 30-40 minutes; their delivery was very slow. I asked why he hadn't told me about that earlier--I would have ordered carrypit otherwise--and he proceeded to yell at me and hang up. I called back again and he hung up on me again after proclaiming that the store was too busy and he had no time to talk to me. 

I then drove to the restaurant; the owner claimed it was extremely busy (it wasn't) and said that the delivery person hadn't even showed up to work until 5:30pm. I reminded him that he told me the delivery person was out sick and he denied it, claiming I called before the delivery person arrived. I showed him on my cell phone where I called to place my order at 6:31pm. The owner screamed at me, put his hand in my face, and refused to give me my food. I demanded my order and he eventually gave me my food, prepared the wrong way and stone cold. 


I will not tolerated being disrespected and lied to, especially by an establishment I *choose* to patronize. I'd give this place zero stars if I could."}
{"text":"\"Don't judge a book by its cover\", was all I could think about after I enjoyed my meal! The food was fresh with great flavor and quantity! The crab Rangoon was amazing and very flavorful! And the staff, very attentive and courteous. Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I ended up with a piece of glass in my good. I'm very lucky it did not break my teeth after chewing down and breaking the piece of glass in half! It has always been a great place to go, but after my experience today, including the wait staff just blowing it off, like it was a common occurrence?!?!??? I'm sorry when there is GLASS in your food, may it be in the rice or the sweet and sour chicken sauce, you SHOULD BE CONCERNED! I will never go back! I've been there soooo many times for lunch! But what the heck?!?!?!? They didn't charge me for my meal, but the people I was with, who obviously stopped eating their lunch, still had to pay.  I'm sad that this happened, but they should at least have acted concerned! I would have taken a photo of the glass to post, but it was taken away VERY quickly!"}
{"text":"Visited on a Thursday night and the restaurant was quite busy. Dimly lit, clean, modern décor. 
Food - 4/5
We ordered the baked seafood in young coconut and thai red curry duck. The seafood in coconut was quite tasty although I felt it was not spicy enough. The red curry was delicious, although the duck meat was just okay and didn't really stand out. Also, I felt that it was a bit odd to have grapes and grape tomatoes in the curry. But again, the flavour of the red curry was so delightful that it made up for the other shortcomings. 

Service - 4.5/5
Service was friendly and attentive. Prompt with the seating, ordering and food delivery. Quite pleased.

Value - 3/5
A good place for good authentic Thai food. I feel that all curry dishes should automatically come with rice. I actually asked if they have roti or naan but unfortunately they did not. So why would none of the curry dishes NOT come with rice?!?! Do people eat curry by itself?.. I took off 1 point in this section because of this. Charging $2 per bowl of rice is not good value. Anyways, I like this restaurant. Good food, nice ambiance. Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Yellow Curry and Pineapple Fried Rice..delicious! I got mild and it still had a little spice but nothing major. Staff were super nice, it's near the college so sometimes traffic is a pain getting in and out of the parking lot but that's my only complaint. Oh, and a second party was seated right next to us when there was a lot of room elsewhere..however it started filling up anyhow. Why do restaurants do that?  I want to go back soon:)"}
{"text":"Are here two times and both experiences were below expectations especially compared to their downtown location.  We ordered their pad Thai and it was poorly made, overly wet with too much runny sauce, noodles were overlooked, flavour was bland.  The biggest disappointment is there satay beef skewers, this was my favour and a must order for appetizer everytime I visited this restaurant downtown.  But this location over cooked it, the beef was chewy and tough. 

We made reservations prior to dining there for the second time for me to give it a second chance.  The restaurant was busy during my second visit but not enough nor good enough reason for inattentive staff to be standing around chatting amongst each other and missing our waves.  Tables around me were getting noticeably upset and annoyed, as was I.

Won't be visiting again, this used to be my favourite Thai restaurant and for those that may have read my Bloor street location review may have noted that I've visited this restaurant over 30 times there.  But this has been a very very disappointing location."}
{"text":"I have visited Thai Basil for about over 30 times in 3 years but have stopped since I don't visit the Annex these days.  This restaurant's provides a very warm and beautiful decor except that it is a small restaurant especially if you are sitting at the tables for 2.

My usual favorites are green vegetable curry, malaysian curry is good to except it has lots of potatoes that I'm not a fan of.  Their pad thai is very good with only one complaint and that it is too oily for me but this dish is equally oily everywhere else.  I also recommend the garlic shrimps with broccoli very flavorful...everytime I go, I MUST order their jasmine green iced tea - it is very refreshing and good!  I really like how the waitresses know I'm a regular and everytime I request for extra spicy that they will use some special chili spice to make my dishes extra HOT!!!  I highly recommend the satay beef skewers as they are the best I have had in town but do watch out for the chicken skewers because they were pretty dry the last 2 times we ordered them.  It comes with a peanut dipping sauce so watch out for those who has any allergies as peanuts does come up in few dishes.

The only one dish I tried and disliked is basil seafood, I've ordered this on 3 separate occasion and the mussels taste spoiled everytime so I stopped on the third time.  

Prices are comparable same as most other thai restaurants and if you go there for lunch they have their lunch specials that comes with salad, soup, spring roll and the entree but the soup is not that great."}
{"text":"Oh yummy!  This place has the best lunch-hour specials ever!  The food is terrific, great portion sizes, great prices, fast friendly service.  It's often crowded during the lunch hour but even when there's a bit of a wait, they're quick so you never have to wait long."}
{"text":"I alway came here on Monday Pad Thai and Spicy Basil was wonderful and staff pretty friendly"}
{"text":"This place is not bad for uptown Thai food. Tom yum soup was delicious and flavourful. Pad Thai was soo sweet (wouldn't order this again!). Mussamun beef curry was pretty good. Bbq pork jowl was probably the best thing we had. Thumbs up for service, ambiance, and weekday lunch deals"}
{"text":"Solid Thai; like other reviewers, they can REALLY increase the level of their heat especially if ordered dishes to be Thai Hot. Unlike my previous review, I consider TB to be one of the better in town and have been back numerous times."}
{"text":"Came here for actually the third time the other night--I am really bad at keeping up with my reviews. Anyways, I have a thing for yellow curry, so I get it every time. Their yellow curry is pretty dang good and I always have enough leftovers for the next day. The most recent time we went, we both got the curry but for some reason it was...flavorless. All we could taste was rice. It was definitely strange and it's usually not like that, so we brought it up to our waitress (we're usually non-confrontational, but we literally couldn't taste anything) and she was very apologetic and sweet. Brought us new, delicious bowls of curry within minutes. I'm convinced they must've just made a mistake and forgotten something, but it wasn't a problem, because they're human too. They are always very attentive to our needs and get us food fast, we will keep returning here for our thai food cravings!"}
{"text":"Just had their green curry with chicken and pat-see-ew with pork.  The noodles were over cooked and mushy.  The curry was better but the color wasn't green unfortunately.  This location is great for a simple dinner date but the food isn't awesome."}
{"text":"One of my favorite thai restaurants! Great food! Not a lot of money. Service is okay. The seating is aweful. Get there before the croud. Bottom line is that the food is amazing and its worth the trip."}
{"text":"Worst Asian restaurant ever. The \"pho\" tasted like noodles and plain hot water. The eggrolls lacked flavor . No matter how I tried to doctor it up it still tasted terrible. Waste of money. I'll haul my butt to Chinatown from now on."}
{"text":"Yum! the penut curry is delish and prices are low. The only downside is the atmosphere change that and it's a 5 star."}
{"text":"soooo yummy! pad see ew is #1 in my heart forever. I'm from northern california, and am going to school here at ASU, so I had to find another yummy thai restaurant nearby, and this is sooo good. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Me and my husband order take out from Thai Basil, the order was around $45, and once we sat down and started eating diner the flavor was very bland not like Thai authentic seasoning and flavors, how disappointed we were,  this was our second time eating there and we wish we could take  the food back and ask 4 our money back. VERY DISAPPOINTED"}
{"text":"After moving to Bay Area for almost a year, I still miss Thai Basil, definitely the best Thai place in Madison. The red, yellow curry and Tom Yum Soup are all really good and takeout order usually just takes 10 minutes to get prepared, which is super fast. Simply put, you can't go wrong with any item on the menu."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with family.  Was pretty good.  Curry was nice and hot. Enjoyed  the atmosphere and food."}
{"text":"Service was friendly. The drunken noodles is the best thing on the menu! It's packed with flavor and so delicious. The kung pao chicken is also very good. We tried the sriracha chicken, and while it was good, it lacked the spice kick I was hoping for. Overall, I would go back; it's a nice quiet place to enjoy good food."}
{"text":"A very cozy and dim restaurant. Enjoyed eating at this place more so than other locations. I like the furnishing and the staff as well. They were genuinely friendly and helpful when it came to menu choices. I'd come back because of the friendliness of the staff by itself. The food was great as well - quality and portion of each dish were priced correctly. I had the tom yum noodles.. It's a spicy sour-ish soup base (sounds disgusting by my description, but absolutely must try) with noodles made to perfection - not under or over cooked. Fiancé had the pad thai.. That was awesome too! I like how they separated the peanuts into a small dish so people can use it to their discretion. Good job, ladies and kitchen!
I'll be seeing you soon!"}
{"text":"The food is awesome!  Everything is perfectly cooked and flavored well.  One of the best pad thai places of the valley.  Prices are typical.  Nice ambiance.   Love the antique type serving wares.  Service is great too.  The place wasn't packed or anything but the food timing was pretty perfect."}
{"text":"I waited a few days to cool off before I wrote this. I didn't want to be emotional. I was pissed when I was there last Wednesday. I visited around 1:30pm, after the crowds hoping for good service and expecting great food. I ordered the chicken massaman yellow-curry mild. I received theeee largest bowl ever, full of watered-down curry, with less than half cup rice noodles and a few chicken pieces. I'm like WTF!!! $9.98 for fkn WATER! Was provided a cup of ice-water with no straw. Not once did anyone asked me if I wanted anything else. Before I could drink the curry , the check was placed in passing by a server and kept going. So the lesson here is if you want real Authentic Thai food cooked by Mexican-kitchen staff , served by some kind of Asians, with the skimping ass food portions, this is the place for You!"}
{"text":"The beef satay and peanut sauce were great but the pad thai was so overly sweet that it was quite disappointing:(  The pork in the pad thai was very dry but the portion was very generous on all accounts.  The meal overall was very affordable but I have to be honest that Pei Wei's pad thai is a lot more enjoyable."}
{"text":"This is the worst Thai food I have ever eaten. The Tom Yum soup tastes like it has a pound of sugar in it. There's no discernible taste of lemongrass or Kaffir lime leaves. The drunken noodles is plain cooked noodles with vegetables. Drunken noodles should be swimming in a delicious savory sauce, and this was as dry as a bone. There is no sauce on the drunken noodles! What a waste of money. If I didn't live 20 minutes away I would have returned the food for a refund. Avoid this place at all costs."}
{"text":"The flavors are amazing and you can order to your heat taste.  I have never left there with an empty tummy, actually I always leave with leftovers. And now that I have been to a few local and different Thai places this one ranks one the best. Just down the street is Thai Elephant and I found there flavors were not as enjoyable as Thai Basil. Hit this place up and get the Pad Thai or the Panang curry."}
{"text":"Delicious all around. Appetizer platter giant. Reasonably priced."}
{"text":"This hole in the wall Thai eatery is consistently tasty. The service is a bit lackluster but it is worth it to taste this food. Prices are reasonable and you'll leave with your Thai urge met. If they are busy, don't stay, go back when they are slow. Even a slight crowd causes the servers to provide extremely bad service, they are easily overwhelmed. I'd advise going mid-week."}
{"text":"Best Darn Tofu Appetizer in the World! I haven't seen any restaurant prepare tofu like this place does. Golden Tofu is a must order if you come here.
The Sriracha beef is so darn good! I haven't tried their sushi. The service is friendly here. My favorite Americanized Thai restaurant is right here."}
{"text":"Ok we ordered Thai and sushi here. Decent sushi, rice has good flavor and presented nicely but a little on the moist side. Service was attentive. The dishes had good flavor. They could stand to put some more chicken in the dishes, seemed like there was hardly any in it (5 slices?). I would expect to have more proteins overall especially if it starts with Chicken, beef @#! etc. Decor is good."}
{"text":"Coconut Soup and Masaman Curry had great flavor, texture, and portion size.

The Pad Thai Chicken was a nice portion but lacked some of that peanut flavor I crave in a good pad Thai noodle.  

The Thai tea was very flavorful and colorful."}
{"text":"My 2nd time visiting this place was last week don't recall the date but food was on point. I don't remember what I had the 1st time I went there,  Whatever was that was good too. My 2nd visit I had soup.  I think it was soup, yellow chicken curry, not bad. Very tasty except for one thing.  I'm going to suggest that the potatoes for yellow chicken curry be cut into smaller pieces, you're feeding people, not horses.  Otherwise the super good I don't care for the soup in the little bowl that they serve you when you first coming.  I don't know what it's called but I think I would rather have it egg drop soup.  Looking forward to my next visit to try something else."}
{"text":"De-licious. Do yourself a favor...eat here as soon as you can. The wait staff was very attentive and sweet. You can't go wrong with anything on the menu. They can spice-up and spice-down any dish you want because everything is made in-house. Want super hot yellow curry or super mild red curry? You got it with a smile! Wonderful fresh Thai, period."}
{"text":"This location is new and food is delicious. I saw it open up on my daily commute and had to stop in.  **I love this place**. The fact it's less than a mile from my house is a extra bonus. Their approach is classic Thai. They are nice with the spice and use quality ingredients. Maybe it's because they just opened but you can tell they take pride in what they do here. The service is polite and attentive. The dishes arrived quickly and were well sized. Although I had Dinner here, I am sure this place would have fast enough service for lunch. I have to do my weekday lunches downtown, there is a Thai Basil there too but its an absolute zoo at lunchtime. 

Thai Basil A +++(A great dish and the namesake)
The veggies A+ (Very fresh)
Noodles A++ (Perfectly cooked)

Price: Very Reasonable"}
{"text":"Food was amazing!!! Had the seafood pad see ew and it was the best I have had. Best grub hub choice to this day."}
{"text":"I've eaten in once, and ordered takeout a couple of times, and I'm a generally a fan of this little neighborhood Thai joint.

It's a simple enough operation, and the folks here have always been friendly. I've never seen more than one or two other tables full, but I have only been in during odd times. You know, you get those odd time Thai food cravings and you've got to get you some.

You can stick with the basics and be pretty happy--they make a nice green curry, red curry, panang, and so on. They're not heaping with meats and veggies, and tend to run on the thinner side of curries, but that's just fine with me. I like to pour a little over rice and make it a big, wet mess. 

Spice levels are adjustable, and they seem to have it dialed in as to what constitutes mild, medium, hot, and authentic. Hot is just on the edge of tolerance, so I always go with medium. It just burns the lips a little afterwards. Know, however, that I'm a big wussy mouth.

Sadly, they recently stopped doing online orders (as of 12/14.... but do check and see if they started again). This was my go-to, especially as sometimes I order from a distance and send someone else to pick it up. I just won't be able to order from them the same without the online function."}
{"text":"Well made and delicious Thai food here.  Portions are on the smaller size but we were full enough as their curries are rich and the coconut in them makes me feel full.  The service is great and the place is youthful probably because of the college nearby.  Almost 5 stars."}
{"text":"This was very delicious food and gracious service.  It was a nice respite in a busy workday to connect with a work girlfriend and eat good food.  I had the ginger chicken with medium spice.  It was super flavorful and done perfectly.  My work friend had a noodle dish that looked amazing.  We were both too busy stuffing our faces to try each other's food.  Good value both to the pocketbook and the waistline."}
{"text":"Place sucks. Right when we went it, we showed out Restaurant.com gift certificate, and they rejected us because it was a weekend. No where on the gift certificate does it say anything about using it on the weekday. So there service isn't great, it was dead in there... no customers and they still didn't take our gift certificate... bad business to turn customers away especially when there's no one in there. Haven't even got to try the food... darn."}
{"text":"The food was not very fresh. The spring rolls were ok but the noodles were dry as if they had been sitting around for some time. The flavor wasn't that great either. I've had better."}
{"text":"The Pad See Yew with tofu was delicious.  Medium was...well, medium; could have been a little spicier.  The tofu itself was really good -- sliced thin and very lightly fried so it had a nice hearty texture.  The dish wasn't exactly piping hot though.

There was some confusion with the salad.  We tried to order the dressing on the side and were told that that wouldn't work because it really needed to be mixed in.  We said fine, just go light on the dressing.  The salad arrived some time after the main course, with a huge bowl of dressing on the side, as opposed to lightly mixed in as we had agreed on with the waiter.  The dressing was very liquidy and kind of a mess, so it would have been better mixed in.  

The place is very small, just one little square room so you never manage to forget you're in a strip mall.  The prices are reasonable and we had no difficulty getting in on Sunday night.  If I lived closer maybe I would go back."}
{"text":"If you like thai food, then this is the place to go! They have great staff and the restaurant its self is comfortable to be in. 

I'm not a big thai lover, but I love their pad thai and thai teas. I've never had any problems here and the amount of food you get is definitely just to the prices."}
{"text":"Very disappointed, gone there with my son & we both got sick. Tufo was old, fried rice was older service was not to be seen still gave them %20 tip but no more. Never again."}
{"text":"This is a restaurant that you go to for the authentic Thai experience rather than simply to fill up your stomach till it hurts.

Surprisingly their prices are reasonable and many of their lunch combos are under $10. Portions are small through. The soup bowl is so tiny I thought it was dipping sauce for the spring roll. I assume it's their culture.

Wonderful service. Clean, spacey restaurant with extra fancy decor. You should totally take a girl out here and show her how cultured you are."}
{"text":"I came here specifically for a Japanese bento box. I got the beef teriyaki which was ok but it definitely didn't taste like teriyaki and seriously needed more sauce. My bento box came with:

miso soup - pretty good
edamame - average
shrimp tempura - horrible, it tasted like a fish stick and had completely different breading than the vegetable tempura
vegetable tempura - average
4 small pieces california roll - good but very small
white rice - average
beef teriyaki - see above

I have never had a bento box that didn't leave me stuffed. I was still actually hungry after eating this and so was my friend that I was there with. The portions of each item are incredibly small. Overall, it just wasn't that great and I don't think I would go back for Japanese food."}
{"text":"Food just ok. Definitely didn't blow my away. What blew me a little, and in the wrong way, was one of the servers. Boy, did she come across as upset. May be she just has one of those resting bitch faces that have a complimentary body language to reinforce her attitude. 

Luckily, midway through our dinner, a new server took care of us. As such, the tip meter started to move higher."}
{"text":"The place is a bit small in the front dining area. The food is hit or miss: I had the yellow curry duck twice and it was excellent but the yellow curry chicken was bland on a third visit more tofu in t that chicken and the house thai basil rice was too spicy and hot and we asked fr it mild and there wasn't much meat in it. On the third visit , I wasn't able to get the waitress I usually get and the waiter I had wanted to bum rush me out the door."}
{"text":"Not sure why people like this place so much. The dishes seem to all come with the same brown sauce (except curry), which seems lazy to me. The servers are always rushing around and the place seems understaffed. I've eaten lots of thai food and this place is less then memorable."}
{"text":"What could be better on a stormy night than some spicy Thai food from Thai Basil?  Not much.

I've eaten here several times but this was my first pickup experience.  The lady was a bit difficult to understand on the phone and I wasn't quite sure if she understood me, but the food was ready in 15 minutes and how I ordered it.

* Spring Rolls - Excellent and I loved the sauce.

* Hot & Sour Soup - Excellent because I always custom order it with all the meats and shrimp.  It costs a bit more but it doesn't matter because it is so good.  The only problem is that I ordered it too spicy.  I went with the Thai Hot and it was a bit too hot.  I'm going with medium next time.

*Cashew Nut Sauteed Plate w/ Chicken - excellent and full of good stuff.  I love love love their curry stuff but since I was sharing with my wife I could order it because she prefers regular stir fry stuff.  Anyway, again, I ordered this too spicy as well but no big deal because it was good.  Next time a medium spicy curry dish for me!"}
{"text":"I ate at Thai Basil for the first time, and I was pleasantly surprised! The restaurant looked a little small for my liking, but the staff members were really nice to the customers and the food was absolutely delicious. I ordered the green papaya salad - mildly spicy, and vegetarian stir-fried chow mein. I usually don't enjoy salad at a restaurants, but I have to say, the green papaya salad was delicious. It was a perfect blend of sweet, sour, and spicy. The different levels of crunchiness from the grated papaya and lettuce worked well together. I really enjoyed it. The chow mein was also delicious as well. The food lacked presentation, but the noodles were chewy, just the way I like it! The spicy/sweet sauce went well with the noodles and the stir-fried vegetables. The veggies were stir fried, and were perfectly cooked, without losing their crunch. The best part about the restaurant was that I did not have to wait for a long time for the foods to be served; it was served almost immediately. The food tasted really fresh. The portion size was also quite big, so I was not able to finish it all by myself. I enjoyed the overall experience, and am definitely going to come back again with friends and family. The food at Thai Basil was a little pricy, but it is absolutely worth it. I would recommend others to try Thai food at this restaurant because it gave me a good impression on Thai food."}
{"text":"Great food! Great service. We say in the back area, super cute!! Loved it! I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Thai Basil is my go-to for take-out Thai food. I have yet to have a bad meal.

The crab Rangoon is consistently the best I've had and a great treat once in a while. prik king is excellent, as is the spicy cashew nut. All the curries are good but a little thin. I think Thai Basil does their best work with their stir fry, so you may want to hold in that direction.

Service is quick and I've never gotten anything that I've had to wait a significant amount of time for...10 minutes to be finished, tops. Just call them, hang up and then drive over.

They have a scale of 1 to 5 for spicy and 4 is usually quite good. 5 is still easy to eat, but a little one dimensional in flavor profile. 

Also, be advised that sometimes an extra ingredient not listed on their menu may work its way in to the dish. If you have an allergy, you may want to mention it."}
{"text":"Went for lunch the other.  I am on a Thai kick lately- tried 5 thai restaurants recently and am trying another next week.

Thai Basil was just okay.  Prefer the soup from Thai Elephant.  Prefer the curry from Papaya Thai.

I did try the Thai iced tea for the first time at Thai Basil.  It was good but I would never order it again.  To heavy for me.  It tasted like yoohoo.

For lunch I had the Panang Curry.  It was good but just nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"The minute I walked in I felt like I was in Thailand.  No wait, I felt like I was in Japan.  No wait, I felt like I was in Vietnam!  If an independent restaurant could steal anything from American corporate restaurants, it is this identity crisis.  

Let's get one thing straight; Thai Basil does not serve Thai food.  They serve Asian-styled American food.  However, I feel that Thai Basil, even despite the name, advertises itself as a fusion restaurant above everything else.  Normally I am hard on non-authentic Thai restaurants, but this one really is just an Asian fusion restaurant, thus I will rate it as such.

We ordered the 'Thai\" iced tea, the Drunken Noodles ($5.95), Panang w/beef ($5.95), the Thai Basil Chicken ($6.95), and a Philadelphia roll just to try.  We also tried the cream cheese wontons, which were a slightly better version of the ones you would get at Pickup Stix, although they were a little bit over cooked.  They came with a non-homemade, sugary sweet and sour sauce that didn't really impress me.  They also offer Pho here, and its probably the only Pho in all of North Las Vegas!  

The \"Thai\" iced tea was the first clue that this wasn't a Thai restaurant.  It was normal brewed coffee over ice with a lot of sugar in it.  I could feel the slight heat from the freshly brewed coffee as the ice cooled it down.  The second hint was that they had soy sauce, but no real Thai chili peppers or fish sauce.  They brought us a thinly ground chili powder, and some sort of chili \"flakes\" upon our request for Thai chili powder.  

The food wasn't bad, but it wasn't great.  The beef Panang was lightly sweet, perhaps a little too sweet for some hardcore curry lovers.  While it was a thick-soupy consistency, it had a definite Indian flavoring to it.  The beef was very tender, although perhaps a little bit fatty.  The Thai Basil Chicken was more of a Chinese dish, with a very light but sweet marinated sauce on it, along with cabbage.  The chicken was well prepared, and very tender.  There was no spice involved in the dish, as one might suspect from a Thai dish.  Probably the worst item that we had was the Drunken Noodles.  The noodles were a flat noodle that you would see in Americanized Chinese restaurants, and the sauce was pretty flavorless.  The noodles were too dry. 

The Philadelphia roll wasn't bad at all.  I am not an expert on sushi, but it seemed fresh, and they stuffed a lot of salmon and cream cheese in the roll. If this were a purely Thai restaurant, I would give them 2 stars for the Thai food.  However, since this is more of a fusion restaurant, and the food was for the most part acceptable, I am giving a generous 3 stars. The prices are also extremely cheap, although the portions are a little bit on the smaller side compared to other restaurants.  I would consider coming back for the sushi, but definitely not the Thai food."}
{"text":"This is an authentic Thai restaurant, no fusion crap.  Dimly lit restaurant with Thai music playing.

Good selection of lunch combos.  The Tom Yum had potent flavours and they didn't chince on the chilli peppers. Spring roll was hot and fresh, not sitting under a heat lamp.

Green curry chicken for the main - fresh ingredients, tender chicken and just the right heat.  Would have preferred less eggplant but that's just me."}
{"text":"I LOVE Thai food.  I have eaten in some great places.  This place...this food....superb!!!  The timing of food may be a bit off...appetizers out late or along with entree and the service a little jumbled...but THE FOOD!!!  Totally, completely, utterly worth all of it.

Vegan friendly.  Food delicious. Place is clean and attractive. Staff are kind, lovely and generous souls.  Good sized portions.

Take your time, eating, enjoying, savouring, every bite.

Great place!!!"}
{"text":"I think this place is delicious! I know I know, there are many locations for Thai food, but this is a short walk from school and the service is always so fast. 

I love getting the eggplant with tofu, the pineapple fried rice with shrimp, and the green curry with chicken. I've also had a really good special that I think was a duck Panang curry, mostly I order everything hot (spice level wise) and can't really notice between medium or hot. Sometimes, if I'm in need I order a Thai tea!

P.s this location offers door dash now for delivery and even though it takes a bit to show up, if you're busy with school work you can get this deliciousness delivered to you!"}
{"text":"I've been going there since they opened. Absolutely love the décor, small but intimate. 

Red curry duck was a bit disappointing- actually had to ask the server where the meat was...she said 'duck's very expensive meat so we measure the right amount..it's there'. Ok...could hardly taste any. 

Baked coconut seafood is served in a coconut as the name implies- fun to eat, wish there's more seafood.

Pineapple rice is a must!

Their green curry is always good.

They used to have the grilled cod as an appetizer but now as a main dish, I haven't tried it as a main dish...hope it's still good."}
{"text":"Mild Pad Thai no tofu with extra peanut sauce is to die for! About $12 bucks but lasts 2-4 meals if you're a poor college student like me. Employees are super nice and always have smiles. Great place to go for quick takeout or to dine in if you've got some time with friends."}
{"text":"Their curries are good, but i don't like their signature entree, that taste too salty"}
{"text":"Simply amazing.  Runs circles around the other Thai restaurant in Scottsdale.   Crab puffs,  spring shrimp rolls, red/peanut curry and pad see eww were all great.  If you like spice, this.is your place."}
{"text":"It's close to ASU so it's very convenient for students! They usually have a lunch special between 1-3 PM. The pad thai, drunken noodles, and green curry are all delicious. The serving size is good, and I usually feel very full afterwards. Service is okay, but not very consistent. There was a time my water was never refilled. Another time, I was just 10 minutes into my meal and my check was already brought over. Other than that, my experience has been pretty positive!"}
{"text":"I have driven by this place so many times and always say I am going to stop in...well, we finally did!  The food was quite good, but the service was definitely lacking.  They were more interested in talking to each other instead of serving customers.  The decor was standard and I didn't like that you could see the kitchen...since all they did was talk to each other instead of cook."}
{"text":"Went with my family tonight .
We have been there many times and they never disappoint . Great food , good prices and friendly service"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place. I can't comment on the meat because I'm vegan, but the food is did order was fantastic. Definitely try the Thai eggplant!"}
{"text":"Rip off! Ordered a Vege dish with curry and you get a small bowl with half filled vegetable worth 50 cents of ingredients; all for $15 including tips and taxes."}
{"text":"I was advised by a server that 90% of the dishes here are prepared with MSG. Clearly this is because the owner is Chinese and not Thai. News alert: Thai food if prepared properly has a ton of flavour and doesn't need f'n MSG.
Banned."}
{"text":"Have tried two times recently and found out that this place is THE place for a pickup.

The owner is super friendly and the food is amazing. I ordered pumpkin curry with shrimp and drunken noodles with spice level 6(which I asked if I could go higher than 5). I absolutely loved them both. 

I will keep coming back to get some takeout orders here since they don't have a dining area there."}
{"text":"The food was disappointing to say the least. The panang was extremely watery, the sweet and sour chicken, which was supposed to be pork but she got it wrong, was mostly vegetables light on the chicken, and the chicken pad see you (spelling is way off) was extremely dry."}
{"text":"Tried Thai food for the first time. I wasn't disappointed. Service is quick & it's not pricey. We ordered Thai Chicken fried rice & Thai Spicy noodles. Both of them were delicious. We should have asked them to make it thai hot as it tastes way better. A friend of mine had Panang Tofu curry, which they highly recommended. Overall it was a nice experience and I'd be back again."}
{"text":"I always get their drunken noodle with chicken and extra veggies. It is amazing!! I also love their Thai coffee. It is pretty good for a Thai chain restaurant and super cute inside with a modern romantic ambience."}
{"text":"Thai Basil has the nicest staff and friendly service every time I dine there. They provide accurate, quick, and labeled take-out which is hard to find in Tempe.

Best dishes are pad see ew and yellow curry. I highly recommend this place for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"First time visiting and I will def return. Their lunch combo menu has good portions, is reasonably priced, and the pad thai is tasty. Nice decor too."}
{"text":"For the price and quality of food, this place is fine. Considering the Malaysian place across the street is slightly cheaper but with better tasting dishes and more variety of dishes, I would choose that place over Thai Basil.

The pad thai was good, the green curry with rice is good, the spring rolls were not so good, a bit flavorless and not enough dipping sauce was given! I shouldn't have to ask for more.

I think you're paying for the great service and ambiance, it feels high end in the restaurant. 

As someone who prefers value over anything else, I don't think it's as good a value most Thai restaurants in the GTA which are much cheaper, taste the same or better."}
{"text":"I'm not a huge Thai fan but I decided to take a chance and come eat here.

I absolutely fell in love and now I crave Thai food all the time! The thai basil with tofu is so good! It has tons of various veggies all in a sauce that bursts with so many complimentary flavors. I warn you to be careful on how hot you order it because at times, my food has been so spicy but so good that my mouth was saying stop but my stomach was making me keep eating. Their spring rolls are really good as well."}
{"text":"Decent Thai food. It doesn't stand out as anything special but the food is good! And locations make it an easy place to go to."}
{"text":"The food was tasty and service was good. I didn't have any negative reactions to the food either (like I sometimes get with low quality Chinese food). The problem was that I was hungry like 45 minutes later, and my comrades that ate with me weren't full from their meals alone. The portion sizes are too small for lunch."}
{"text":"I ordered the shrimp fried rice. It came with frozen vegetables heated in the rice....some of the peas were hard. Needed salt seasoning, dish was chipped. Three servers asked me how it was. Only one of them cared (a more mature and experienced lady) when I told them. Atmosphere was nice, service was prompt.  But I won't be back."}
{"text":"Thai Basil is my go-to for Thai food. I've tried other Thai places, but none of them have been as good. Depending on my mood, I either get the pad Thai, Thai Basil, or curry chicken. It's all so good! I especially like the veggie soup that comes with lunch special. I love soup and could just make a meal off of that."}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch today. We had pad see ew that's was so salty and inedible. Ordered Thai hot and I got some pepper sprinkled on top. I received much better food and service at Thai2go which is considered fast foods.. pretty disappointing"}
{"text":"Fast, friendly, & delicious.  

I went with the tofu Panang Curry. My friend had the Pad Thai with chicken.  We were satisfied.  

The only issue - she was given two random shrimp with her order.  But I solved the problem by putting them in my belly."}
{"text":"As a newcomer to Phoenix, a good Thai restaurant was a must for my new home. Thai Basil does not disappoint. I'm a huge yellow curry fan, and I gauge Thai restaurants by the quality, flavor, and textures of their yellow curry dishes. Never before have I eaten such a creamy YC. This renders the curry flavor very slightly less...curried...but I find myself going back time and time again for their take on this classic. Having eaten at lunch and dinner times, both in-restaurant and takeout, you will get a cheaper lunch that's overly filling, or for a dollar or two more a dish that'll last you two meals at least. Parking can be hit-or-miss, but I do love how close Thai Basil is to Tops!"}
{"text":"I have been to this location and the Rural Rd location several times, both are awesome. I prefer this one because of the atmosphere. I definitely recommend eating here, delicious. I get the Musaman curry frequently, but I'm a curry person."}
{"text":"I ordered green curry with chicken, requested medium spicy. The curry was as spicy in terms of heat, but it was mostly coconut cream and very thick. It also lacked the flavors of green curry and was bland. The green pepper was large pieces and it felt like there was not so much meat and veggies as I'd expect, but a lot of thick, coconut gravy."}
{"text":"Very fair pricing and great Thai. I picked up an order of sweet potatoes and green curry prawns. OMG! It was so delicious I took a nap afterwards that was also glorious. Great for lunch and dinner. I will be returning again."}
{"text":"I'm Thai and I approve!  I really enjoyed the food here and all the dishes I tried exceeded my expectations.  The restaurant is brightly lit and simply decorated.  There's a private parking lot for easy parking.

The menu offers your typical Americanized Thai food options.  I like how they categorize the menu by flavor and you can pick your protein which varies in prices (chicken, beef, pork, tofu, shrimp, squid, salmon, red snapper, or seafood (shirmp, scallop and calamari)).

--Thai Ice Tea - Large $4.50 - The biggest Thai iced tea I've ever had.  It was good to the last drop!
--Chicken Tom Yum Soup $10 - Expensive for soup, but good value because the portion is huge and can serve 4.  I wish they had an option for a smaller size.
--Crab Puffs (6 pieces) $6 - These crab rangoon were on the skinny side, but they were tasty.
--Thai Basil with red snapper $13 - This was a great dish and the red snapper was nicely cooked. I love that there was a lot of vegetables in it along with the fish.
--Pad Thai with chicken $10 - Perfectly cooked noodles and delicious!  

We didn't have room for dessert, but they had great options on the menu: fried banana ice cream, sweet sticky purple rice with mango or Thai custard, sticky rice with coconut ice cream, and coconut ice cream.

{"text":"Not only is this place closed on Sundays. But it was closed for 3 days after mothers day. I've heard their business has been slow. Now I know why. They're only open 3 days a week. At least the Fried rice is good though."}
{"text":"By far the worst Thai food I've ever had. i had the drunken noodle - noodles were so soggy they fell apart on my fork and the only vegetable in it was cabbage which tasted strongly of chemicals. My dad had the pad thai which was closer to italian spaghetti than any thai dish. When the server came back to take our bill he never asked how our food was even when noticing i had only taken one bite. when i politely tried to give him some feedback on the dish he said \"it shouldn't have tasted bad\" then walked away and brought back the bill. No apology or offering to bring me something else. Wont be back!"}
{"text":"Taste so good! Completely out of my expectation. The spice is just right.  I had a Tom Yum noodle soup with chicken. Yummy!!! Recommend anyone to try if you are craving for spice suddenly."}
{"text":"Tried this restaurant on a Wednesday night with a party of 6. My first impression was that the decor of this restaurant is very nice, and the ambiance is definitely on the comfortable to romantic side. good for a small party of friends or even a couple. 

Now onto the most important part which is the food. The restaurant i find has very up and down in terms of food some good and some bad.

The first dish we tried was a the crispy shrimp/seafood. This dish was by far the best one they had, as the sauce had a very good flavour and texture, just the right amount of sweet and salty. 

The Second Dish to arrive was the Green Curry Tiger Prawn, this one was very disappointing as the green curry itself to begin with was not spicy at all, and also the \"tiger prawn\" was not tiger prawn as advertised but rather regular frozen shrimp. if the restaurant charges more for tiger prawn and advertise as such, they should provide tiger prawn at the very least. and if you were to cook it curry it is supposed to be you cook the prawn separate with marinated to get the flavor before you put it in the curry to soak it in. 

The Third Dish was Pineapple fried rice. This dish was average, the food had good presentation value, however the flavour was not better then other thai/viet restaurants that serve the same, in fact you could tell there was not much effort spent putting the right spice into the rice. 

The Fourth Dish was Smoked Duck, which was not only small in size, but also defeated the purpose of smoke duck, as it had way too much sweet sauce on it, and you cannot taste the smoked part if there was any at all. at the price of 14 something they charged pre tax you expected a better portion at least or better quality one or the other. 

The Fifth dish was the baked seafood, which was actually kind of nice, it was placed in a coconut and a thicker richer texture, the flavour was actually pretty good, and the seafood was plentiful inside. it was a very creative dish and the presentation value was nice. 

The Sixth Dish we did was the steam fish, which was fillet, the fish was largely tasteless, although it looked good when presented, you can tell it was done properly. 

The Last we went through was Desert, we had the tapoica desert, which was nice and simple which was tapoica with a coconut based cream. 

Overall i feel this restaurant has a lot of potential, as it has a solid menu of choices, and the environment is nice, however many dishes had flaws in them. I believe a focus on the cooking and marinating is necessary to improve"}
{"text":"So my lunch crew come here about once per week for the lunch special. Comes with a cup of soup, a spring roll, and an entree. First off let me say this. It's $7.95. It comes out in 10 minutes. It tastes pretty good.... and did I mention, it's $7.95. Granted this is for the chicken pork or beef. Shrimp is $2 more and seafood special is $3 more. 

I usually get the special with chicken or the chow mein with chicken or pork. Spice levels are low meaning Medium for me is not problem. Friends have had hot and Thai hot and they said the same, could kick it up a notch. 

Service is alway slightly above par. Meaning it's not fantastic but it's good enough to never have to complain. And they routinely fill the water glass. 

All in all, this is a no frills Thai restaurant that doesn't pretend to be anything else. Food is above average considering price point.  Great value!"}
{"text":"Went here for a quick lunch here yesterday, after not being here for years.  I used to come here quite often when I lived around the corner.  We had sesame chicken lunch, drunken noodles with chicken, and a sushi roll with soft shell crab.   The food was pretty good.  The crab in the roll was almost non existent, being chopped up a lot.   I like it when they keep the fried soft shell crab whole.  I estimate it had only about a 1/4 of a small one inside.  It was $9.95, and I would have paid more if they did that...but whatever.  The menu is all over the place...Thai, Vietnamese, Japanese and Chinese.  I didn't realize all the sushi specials until after I ordered and was walking out, because the board was in a weird place and the server didn't say.
The place is oddly decorated, kinda fancy...but ok.  At least they had a tv on, that had soccer playing.  We were the only other table in there occupied at lunch.  The service was very good though, attentive but not overbearing.  Just wanna mention the slight \"sewer\" smell still there.  It was there when I used to go, kind surprised it's still there....    Overall, ok food, excellent service, reasonable prices.   Will probably be by again if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"This restaurant has very good food. The yellow curry is amazing. The fish is very tasty and the Malaysian style vegetable not too salty."}
{"text":"It is always nice to find a place that can make just about any dish with tofu as the main protein. This means a vegetarian like me can choose from any dish on the menu.  Despite this flexibility I tend towards the red curry. I get this as hot as they will make it with out an argument ensuing, which is usually pretty decent on the heat scale. It is a great medley of crisp vegetables in a creamy coconut milk base red curry. The tofu is the fried style which adds an interesting textural variety to the standard tofu.

The lunch specials come with a small salad, a small soring roll and a little slice of watermelon all in the $7 range. 

Service is decent, my water received frequent refills as i tend to drink quite a bit with spicy food. 

Parking here can be a bit tight at high times, and there also may be s small wait. If there is a wait go to the liquor next store to find an amazing beer selection."}
{"text":"Absolutely nothing to complain about. We were surprised they gave us the happy hour menu although it was after 6 p.m. Service was fantastic and the restaurant was very clean. I will definitely be a repeat customer."}
{"text":"Been back a few more times and tried a few more dishes.

Satay still pleases and the curries are excellent specially the Green Curry with its excellent bite and character.



Service is consistently friendly from visit to visit with familiar staff (low turnover) overall one of my favorite restaurants hands down."}
{"text":"Overall one of the best Thai restaurant in the valley,this is the mother ship of there 3 locations,and they cook when ordered.you can pick your level of spice.sweet,
They offer traditional Thai dishes and deserts.yummy sticky rice
You can BYOB,so bring your favorite bottle of wine and enjoy.
Stay gold yelpers"}
{"text":"Thay are okay, first time for me to try thai food"}
{"text":"Great little joint. The food is very good most of the time we go. The owner and family are great to deal with. Pad Thai is good, massaman is excellent and green curry is great too. Lots of good food. Not the best that I have ever had but will do for Tempe. Close, easy and good."}
{"text":"I would like to start out by saying that the service here is exceptional. The waiters are kind every time I go, and the atmosphere is great as well- it's decorated very nicely. The food is also good- I felt like the curry was cooked well, and the dessert (sticky rice with coconut) was delicious. One of the better Thai places in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Central location in downtown Phoenix. This location is in the strip mall next to Starbucks. Great daily lunch specials that are affordable. This location is great about serving you hot and fresh food. Out of all the Thai Basil's this one is not my favorite. The quality of service and taste of food is not good as the others. The last visit I had earlier this week was during lunch. The restaurant had plenty of tables open as we beat the rush lunch crowd but that did not slow down our server. She was not the friendliest wait staff. She seemed a little frazzled and had no smile. My order did not come our right however, I decided to try my best to enjoy it. My chicken was dry, the sauce was scarce and I do not believe I got the order I asked for. My friends order came out perfect. I asked for extra sauce and the server told me she would have to bring my plate back and they would remake me a new one. I did not want the trouble so I settled. We paid our tab with no thank you for coming in. I honestly think if they stepped the service they could win me over. I am in no rush to return here anytime soon."}
{"text":"My friend and I ordered the panang curry and red curry with chicken. Both curries were delivered hot and fresh. However, both our meals had only 2-3 pieces of chicken in them. We were pretty surprised since we ordered online leaving very little room for ambiguity. In any case, we ate it all. It was good anyways."}
{"text":"I went during lunch time and luckily we got a table right away. Soon after, the place get really busy. Because the place is located in downtown business area, you'll see most of the customers are non-asian. 

The lunch menu is limited to rice dishes, curry, and pad thai noodles. But you can still order from the dinner menu. We end up ordering papaya salad, which I thought was just okay. There wasn't much papaya in the dishes as they also overfill it with salad and tomatoes. 
The best I thought was the tom-yum soup, which is sour, spicy, and a taste of sweet. I would recommend the tom-yum soup. 
We try their signature dish of Thai Basil, which is a stir fry of your choice of meats and vegetables. The dishes came out really really spicy, which was a surprise to me. I should have tell them to do it mild."}
{"text":"Good lunch specials - reasonable prices, includes soup & spring roll. Quick service. Tried fried rice with tofu and garlic shrimp. Both were well prepared and delicious. Recommended!"}
{"text":"I started going here for the Pad Thai, but have since tried their sushi and I really enjoy it. Their night time server is awesome and it's a nice quite place to go enjoy a meal with the wife or family."}
{"text":"Loved it.  The owners were awesome, family owned business, lady was very sweet. Just moved here from LA and was close to the hotel so decided to wander in.  Had the Tom yom soup with shrimp. Delicious, and generous amount of larger shrimp, and they even take the tails off which most places don't, so annoying.  No complaints, just good food and a great experience."}
{"text":"I cannot get enough of this place.  Especially when I was hipped to the Thai hot secret.  It's very inexpensive, and they have the best Thai Iced Tea, which I could drink 3 glasses of if I didn't know any better.

I can't stop rocking the red curry."}
{"text":"Fast service and good Thai food. Perfect for a quick lunch away from the office. The staff are quick to refill drinks, my water was never empty. Will certainly be eating here again."}
{"text":"My favorite Thai restaurant in town. They are a Phoenix local chain, and seem to be family run. All of the servers and employees are awesome and really friendly. Thai basil is a great place to fine in for a casual, yet nice dinner or if you just want some take out. 

I always go with the Crystal Noodle! Gotta get it spicy, and for the bold... Double Thai spicy!"}
{"text":"Very typical Thai food. Not bad. Not up there. The drinks size are really small; I paid $4 for a tiny cup of ice tea. But it's not a big too deal. I usually have a lot to say but I am speechless for this restaurant; it's not because it is bad but the food is just what you expect. Solid tho"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite Thai restaurants.And the only one in North town I like. 

They have lunch specials for $7 and my favorite is the Moon Harbor chicken and Panang Chicken and Pad Thai. 

Great place to eat sushi as well. =)"}
{"text":"A true small gem in North Las Vegas. Loud tourists aren't something you have to deal with in this local spot. All waiters/waitresses are attentive to the diners. Food is priced great, and came out quickly. You'll definitely need a take home box :) you won't be disappointed by eating at Thai Basil!"}
{"text":"This location is a pleasant, \"cozy\" restaurant that can fill up fast during rush hours. Call ahead, or get take out if it's packed. The food is very good; the signature dish that gives the restaurant its name is my favorite. 

Thai food is traditionally spicy. You know this. You expect this. You want this. On my last visit, I ordered my food at the \"medium\" level, and it was not spicy at all. Certainly not \"Thai medium.\" Are they holding back? 

Plus, Thai always makes the BEST leftovers. I purposely save a portion of my dish every time just so I can have it stew in its own juices for 24 hours and reheat it the next day. YES. ...Is that weird?"}
{"text":"It has been a while since I visited Thai basil. They had lunch specials today including red curry with roast duck and tom yum noodle soup. I went with a large group and we tried both. Both dishes were underwhelming. They weren't bad, just not the amazing food I have come to expect from this place. I will stick with their regular menu in the future."}
{"text":"My first time here. I just moved from Florida couple days ago. This is the first restaurant in Arizona that I try. The sever is very nice. The food very awesome and very big portion!!!"}
{"text":"Our favorite Thai spot in the Tempe area. The curries are fantastic and I found it hard to stray from them. Fast service and great for take out."}
{"text":"I've only ordered carry-out from here, but I must say everything has been top-notch. All of the curries are packed with veggies, loaded with flavour, and absolutely delicious! I like that they serve alcohol too, so I'm excited to try dine-in sometime."}
{"text":"Located in a plaza on Major Mackenzie, Thai Basil is not difficult to find. There are plenty of parking spaces here.

When we came in, it was decently filled, but we still were able to get a spot in the restaurant. I love the decoration of the store - it's really Thai styled, but not over the top Thai style. Their Thai iced tea is delicious, definitely worth trying.

Food prices here are less than $10.My friends got the curry with rice, which was actually had delicious authentic taste. This was served separately, so you are able to choose how much curry you wanted to add - if it's too spicy, you add a lot less.

I got the pad thai, and unfortunately, it was one of the worst pad thai's I have ever had. The pad thai was much more sour than usual pad thai. I felt like they added less sugar to mix in the taste. DO NOT COME HERE FOR THE PAD THAI, but come here for the rice and iced tea!"}
{"text":"I guess Thai Food is like sex because it is always good but some are better than others .

As soon as we were seated the server gave us on the house cups of tofu vegetable soup that was fresh and tasty and later took our order skipping out before we had time to order drinks .... then we got glasses of water .

I have the Green Curry with tofu Lunch , my curry came out white and tasted ALMOST like melted coconut ice-cream but with chili's and Basil . My tofu was browned on one side and I got some nice vegetables , rice and a fried vegetable roll that was almost burnt .

I have been here before and they really were much better last time  so ?????
 This really wasn't the best Thai maybe it was the worst I've had so far but it was OK I think..."}
{"text":"Sigh...this place is just a huge SIGH. Food looks awesome on pictures, most reviews are a thumbs up for this place but yet....when I came to this place with my bf , was just us and one family. Food came out relatively quick. Waitress was friendly but sigh...the sweet and sour chicken, curry style rice in a pine apple as well as an order of pad Thai were all cold. I tried to eat it but was so cold , especially the sweet and sour chicken. I told the waitress to please replace these dishes as they are all cold. Besides these dishes being cold, the flavour is lacking big time. It tastes so bland and just has no kick to the mouth with flavours at all , let alone from Thailand. Needless to say, we had a couple of bites, paid and never returned."}

{"text":"I LOVE Thai Basil!
Seriously, this is my go to food. Whenever my boyfriend and I don't want to cook and are really hungry, or want to treat ourselves we look at each other and one of us will undoubtedly ask \"Thai Basil\". YES always YES!
I love Thai Basil so much that as I am writing this I know what kind of food I will be eating tonight!
Try it!
The shrimp Tempura is amazing.
The wontongs... oh my gosh!
and I love love love the Spicy Cashew Chicken.
The people working there are really friendly.
If you like Thai food you will love it! :)"}
{"text":"Probably the best Thai food I've had in downtown Toronto. 
Went with my parents and we split 4 dishes - shrimp tom yum, shrimp pad Thai, shrimp green curry and chicken pad see ew. 
The tom yum soup was absolutely fantastic and probably the best dish we had. Just the right amount of kick and spice, paired with the lemongrass - perfect.

Green curry was also really really good. I had most of the pad see ew which I never tried before - I usually get pad Thai and I'm glad I mixed it up! It was really really good. Surprisingly light and you don't feel super stuffed.

The pad Thai was probably the least favored dish. It wasn't bad, it just wasn't the best pad Thai we've had. 

Service was fantastic too & prices are reasonable. In conclusion, if you're coming here your best bet is to try other Thai dishes instead of the usual pad Thai. :)"}
{"text":"Very average food and horrible service. Waitress gave us attitude for not understanding her accent and never even bothered to check on us once during meal."}
{"text":"I have given this restaurant several opportunities to get it right.  Rarely have they ever got it right, from poor service, to cold food and numerous other negative experiences.  I totally give up and hope to never revisit this restaurant ever again.  If you want good Thai food, with efficient friendly service, don't come to this establishment."}
{"text":"I have had curry many many times from places that was just ok or very blah or downright awful. This place amazed me! I really can't believe how yummy it was. I had the masaman curry w/tofu. The curry was so flavorful. I even commented to my coworker that I would love to bathe in it! lol (Ok.. slight exaggeration but it was delish!!!!)  I will be back FOR SURE!!!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on Tuesday around 1 PM. The room looks newly furnished and AC is running good. Sat down by the window and met with super friendly server. He explained the lunch special deal and I ordered the Basil with pork. Water came first, followed by a bowl of soup (veg soup). No longer than 7 mins, my lunch came and I began! It was a big plate for lunch and totally worth the price. I also got a take away, BBQ Pork, it came before I finished my lunch, so I sampled several pieces and those pork is so tender and very delicious!!!! You gotta eat it right after, though. Just like any BBQ meats. Over all, it was a great spot for me! Repeat"}
{"text":"We came around 8pm on Friday and we didn't need to wait too long to be seated. Service was okay. The past couple visits I would still give a 3-4 stars but this time the food quality totally disappointing. The chicken Pad Thai is extremely sour.. (probably too much ketchup??) It's just not as good as before and the quality keeps going downhill. Unfortunately this will be my last visit. However, the only thing I would recommend is the Thai iced tea."}
{"text":"Went for lunch one day with a co-worker.  It was pretty busy but we were still seated quickly.  You get a salad with your meal, which I did enjoy.  I ordered the pad thai.  It was a little too sweet for my taste."}
{"text":"I love Thai food and this place was a huge disappointment.

Clean, good looking interior. Really helpful and charming staff. Good prices.  All these positive attributes mean nothing if the food is bland, overcooked, and for Ganesha's sake, they served me boil in a bag rice. I prefer Jasmine rice. Hell, I'd tolerate well made white rice, the sticky kind. But no. Boil in a bag tasting rice that doesn't stick and falls all over the plate. I want to pour curry over it and go to town on it, but they denied me that!

2/10 Will not return

Oh, and I ordered medium hot curry and it was spicy like a carrot. Which is not at all. /cry"}
{"text":"We ordered two entrees and one side for dinner along with two Thai Iced Teas.  The price was right and the food was good.  If it wasn't so far from my house I would be back more often!"}
{"text":"This place is a staple lunch place for the people that I work with. It's always a good time and really easy to eat within an hour. 

I love rice dishes and my favorite is the signature Thai Basil with shrimp. You can order your meal any temperature you like. I love mine spicy and it's usually perfect. 

I have never had a bad meal, but once I ordered a bowl of soup and didn't feel like it was a good deal. It was basically the free soup that they serve before the meal and they charged $7 for a bigger bowl. Not a value! 

Overall, this place is delicious and generally a good value. I just know not to order the soup again."}
{"text":"Great place for lunch!

I like to come here for lunch sometimes when I can even though I am not an avid fan of curry in general! I like their curries actually, they're not overpowering and have a smooth texture. 

The lunch menu is seriously a blessing, it is a great price for the food you're getting as it is prepared fresh and well. I love the Mussaman Curry, it is literally one of the best things I have ever tasted. The beef brisket is tender and the curry is heavenly. It is extremely flavourful, the peanut really comes through and there is sweetness from both the onion and the curry itself. It's fairly mild, not so much a heated or spicy curry but it is insanely delicious. I love potatoes simmered in sauces and this curry comes with potatoes! There's just something about potatoes when they're simmered and soft. I highly recommend this dish if you ever go here, it's really good! 

The spring roll and Tom Yum soup you get with the lunch menu orders are okay, I don't like the soup personally but it's not bad. The spring roll is nice, it's crisp and has a good filling. 

The skewers are actually okay, they're not super great but not bad. The peanut sauce they come with however is delicious. It's smooth and sweet and it has the consistency of a curry. I would order the skewers just for the sauce, if only this came with orders of rice so I could drizzle this over everything! 

The fried banana is a hit consistently! I always order the fried banana! It's a little pricey for what it is, but this fried banana is the best I've had so far! They don't use your ordinary bananas, but the Latundan banana I believe. It's got this nice light sweetness to it that your ordinary banana does not have. The batter is nice, thick, and crisp. Fried to perfection! The banana does not have a lumpy texture after it is fried, but a slightly softness to it. Drizzled with honey and served with mango ice cream, it is a definite order every time. This fried banana is almost unreal. 

The interior is nice and clean, a little dark but comfortable. Good food and a little pricey, but the lunch menu is definitely a good deal! I would definitely recommend a lunch here when in the area."}
{"text":"Mediocre at best thai food. There are so many superb Thai places in Toronto that it's not worth eating at the average ones. I've eaten here with my mother once and I will never go back. Did not taste authentic (flavourless). The mango salad was the only thing I actually enjoyed. I would not recommend this restaurant to anybody I know."}
{"text":"Went to Thai Basil for lunch today and thought it was very good.  The service was friendly and efficient and the fool was fresh and tasty.  

The pre-meal soup was a mediocre broth vegetable soup.  Nothing too exciting but not too bad either.  I could take it or leave it.

I ordered the Green Curry lunch special - Thai hot, which she warned me was \"very hot\".  The curry came out quickly (almost too quickly - meaning the ingredients were thrown together and not allowed to marry) and it was spicy indeed , but not too much so.  The meal consisted of the curry itself, an egg roll, and a little bit of rice.  The egg roll was tasty and the curry was fresh and full of vegetables.  I do wish the veggies were a bit more cooked and the flavors of the curry ingredients were more combined, and that more rice was served with the meal.

Overall very satisfied with my experience with Thai Basil.  My rating is more of a 3.5.  A place I would not go out of my way to get to, but also a place I would go to again willingly."}
{"text":"Vegas Thai restaurants are better than here in tempe. So we ordered:
*red curry: the chicken was tough but there was too many vegetables 
*pad see eww: flavor, spice & veggies were good but the beef was cooked tough as well
*pad tai: it was \"alright\" 

Our server was very friendly & conversated with us. He recommended the \"Thai basil\" but was too spicy so substituted it with the \"ginger\" w/o charging us

Side note: it was not busy when we came in, & there were 3 employees just talking not doing anything. Well when I walked into the 1 stall bathroom, the trash was overflowing & they were out of toilet paper. Hello restroom check? Talk about lazy.  Just saying"}
{"text":"For the past 4 years my husband and I have been weekly customers of Thai Basil.  For the past few months we were noticing inconsistencies with the spices, and the portions were getting smaller.  We adjusted our orders accordingly when ordering and enjoyed our meal.  Last nights interaction ended our patronage of Thai Basil.  Our family placed a larger than usual order for a party we were having.  We SPECIFICALLY STATED numerous times that we needed it to be very mild.  This is how we have always ordered from Thai basil and for the most part we received edible dishes.  We could not touch last nights dishes.  They were caked in red pepper flakes.  Like anyone would do, we called Thai Basil and I explained that our $60 order was not at all  prepared the way we requested.  The gentlemen on the phone recalled our order and asked the kitchen how it was prepared.  The kitchen said that at a mild (a one star) they put 1 Tablespoon of red pepper flakes in each dish.  1 tablespoon is NOT mild, and when we've ordered mild before it has NOT ever looked or tasted the way the dishes did last night.  Anyhow, the guy answering the phone told me he would have the dishes remade.  I asked him to deliver them since we didn't care to head out again to pick them up and he told me i would have to wait an hour.  I said we would come back to the restaurant and he told me to bring the uneaten dishes.  I thought the issue was resolved until the owner told him to tell me he was not making any of the dishes over and that I should \"probably stop eating their food.\"  Well Mr Owner, you got your wish.  I will stop eating your food, and I will make sure everyone I know also stops eating it.  I was willing to look over the lack of consistency with the dishes but the complete unprofessionalism & extreme rudeness was the icing on the cake.  
Upon reading other reviews it seems that the owner does this often."}
{"text":"Get the noodle curry with chicken. You won't regret it. This place is small and probably overlooked but worth the time. Everything from the Tom Yum to the entree to the Thai tea was really well prepared. Also if you like heat, request their Thai spicy. It will light your fire."}
{"text":"Thai Basil would have won a 4-star from me if their service was better, because the food is delicious!

First of all, the decor is lovely - it's modern Asian flair that isn't stuffy or over the top. I loved the bench seating style with the cushions - very comfy.

The food was tasty - I was actually worried it'd be a bit watered down (this is my first Thai Basil visit EVER)  but it was actually good. It could have been a tad spicier (I tried to play it safe with the medium but ended up dousing my food in peppers anyway) but it was still enjoyable. I had lunch with 3 of my friends, and I shared pad thai with one (my favorite Thai dish - it wasn't the best pad thai I'd ever had, but I will go back for more) and I had the chicken panang. I like the panang to be a bit sweeter, but it was still delicious. 

As far as the service, I hate to say that it's your average small-time Asian restaurant service. Everyone basically seems rushed all the time, no one was personable, and they just did the bare minimum - take orders, drop off food, and I honestly can't remember anyone smiling. We sat without our waters refilled for quite some time and only had it refilled when our food arrived. There really wasn't much else to it.

If the service improves, I'm sure the tips will too. But I'll definitely come back for the great food."}
{"text":"Stopped in on Wednesday for a quick lunch, only had 30 minutes. Ordered my favorite Panang Curry, ordered it \"hot\"...meaning spicy.
My order was quickly delivered, a bowl of curry and a mound of rice, looked pretty good. Once the rice was added to the bowl and dish cooled down, I dug in....no chopsticks were given, it was a fork to feed yourself place. The curry was tasty and all the right ingredients were there, however, it was far from spicy enough. My guess is that a downtown place will not make food spicy as some will order but not really want it that way and thus not return. So, I understand. The restaurant was clean, nicely arranged and service was fast and good. I would return, I would just ask if they could add a bit more spice to the dish I ordered."}
{"text":"Good, not great, and that's ok.  It's not conveniently located, and that's ok too.  

Food was fast, which always makes me scratch my head a little bit.  Everything was also just a bit too sweet - another head scratcher.  Pad Thai was good, but the spring rolls and the drunken noodles left me wanting something more authentic.  The food here is definitely geared towards the American palate, which is probably how they ended up with a Japanese sushi bar in a Thai restaurant.

Decor is very \"strip mall\" and not what I want in a dining experience.  However, the tables are well spaced which is good because they are always understaffed.  Servers and managers (owners) are running around trying to serve too many guests at once.  This creates a wait at the door, and a wait at the table.  However, once your order gets to the kitchen, it comes out lightning fast and hot.

But going here means that I am supporting a local small business, so I'll be back in hopes of it getting better."}
{"text":"If you walk in and see it's busy, or there is a large group dining, go somewhere else if you have time restraints. Service is usually ok, but when there's large groups or it gets a little busy, it gets a little rough. 

I come during my lunch hour, and it's usually a decent place. The lunch special is a good deal and the food is decent as is the portion size for the price. It's nothing stellar or out of the ordinary, but it is still tasty and an easy choice for the usual Thai fare if you need a quick bite and like to sit down. 

The restaurant is very decorated, clean and comfortable. 

Overall it's a decent choice in the area. There are, of course other choices nearby if it looks too busy."}
{"text":"I like Thai Basil and come here pretty often as it is easy for me to walk here on my lunch break between classes or call for take out on my way home or for a quick dinner. I generally stick to a few basic things with the curry dishes (panang curry being a favorite of mine) and tom-kah soup. I mix it up with what meat i get in things but usually chicken in my curries and beef in soup.

I tend to order my foods hot which is very spicy in the soup but not so bad in the curries. They pack good flavor especially the soup but the meats just seem off in the curries, they don't seem to have the right flavor or texture.  The beef in the soup is perfect however and melts in the mouth. The other thing i have noticed is when i have ordered other curry dishes that have potatoes they seem to lack flavor and don't absorb the curry like i am used to. The one time I ordered a non-curry dish i got the eggplant garlic which had great flavor but sadly lacked on the eggplant.

I do love the lunch specials here at $7 for a meal that is an entree with rice and a little spring roll it sure beats an over priced meal at the MU or McDonalds next door for the same price. I keep coming back because it's convenient and fills a craving for thai food and my spicy side. Honestly i could have the tom-kah soup with beef all the time as that spicy coconut soup is just perfect. Yet for a complet Thai meal with a curry dish and soup Thai Elephant is my go too."}
{"text":"Had beef satay, chicken pad thai, and ginger tea. Both dishes were very tasty and came out super quick. The beef satay was so juicy! The ginger tea was also excellent. All this for just over $20. Good food, quick service, and great value. Will be back."}
{"text":"Another spectacular meal at Thai Basil! Had out of state guests and took them there for dinner on a Saturday night. We asked Darlene, our waitress, for suggestions and she asked the right questions to make sure we loved our meal. Cant wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"Very good food we were very happy the only reason I am not giving it a 5 star is it's not a really great looking place like as in first date not a home feeling ore like strip mall feel bla. Workers very nice and as I said very good food"}
{"text":"Cockroach in the Thai Iced Tea-gross. The manager tried to say it was a fly but it was definitely a roach."}
{"text":"Actually, more like 3.54576745 stars.

These are the same peeps in Tempe and I'm sure Chandler, and now they're in Downtown Phoenix. Thank goddess, because the pseudo-Asian hole that was in its place before was rank. I was sooo excited to see Thai Basil, with its kicking-my-boring-office-lunches-up-a-notch potential move in. Only ever having been to their Tempe location, I know at least there they had some of the better Thai I've had in AZ.

Luckily, the same applies here. The food was good overall (and their Thai tea is always yum); although my barbeque chicken was a little lackluster, my colleagues had the red curry and Thai basil special and were both impressed. 

What wasn't impressive was the service. It seems this downtown location is still getting used to that hustle-and-bustle office lunch crowd (I think it just opened last week). We saw our server twice - once to take the order and the second to bring it - and afterwards, were on our own for extra silverware, water refills, and asking for the check. Which usually can be forgiven if the food's super good - but not so much when I'm on my lunch break and need to get back to the office pronto.

They actually apologized for the service (they really did seem overwhelmed) but could've left us with a better first impression if they'd comped the drinks or given a discount.

Nevertheless, I'll be back to this location, though probably for takeout. If I try them again for a sit-down and the service is improved, I'll add the 4th star. I know you're all waiting with bated breath..."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant !  The people are awesome !  They remember your name when you call them up for great take out!"}
{"text":"Always crowd, but fast. I usually just be there to have a thai fry rice. I have to say the food is decent, and worth the money. If they could have more seats then it would be prefect."}
{"text":"Rather poor service. Flagging a waitress was harder than trying to catch a thin slice of mushroom with chopsticks. Just saying...
I was so frustrated that I  hastily finished my delicious green mango salad (topped with fried onions to give it the perfect crunch) and got my main meal as takeout.

In other news, the pad thai, bright orange and too sparsely decorated with the supposed-to-be-standard toppings of vegetables, tofu, and peanuts, tasted sugary sweet. Almost like cough syrup."}
{"text":"I wish I had only eaten what I ordered! The special Thai basil with chicken, it was was awsome! Fresh veggies in a perfectly spicy sauce with lots of white meat chicken with perfectly cooked jasmine rice. Unfortunately I tried what my hubby ordered too. The pad Thai was inedible it was so sweet. Way too much sugar and the noodles were gummy and yuck. Luckily there was enough of mine to satisfy us both. We also tried the Thai iced tea and Thai iced coffee, as well as the sticky desert rice pudding with mango. Interesting texture and good flavor. I will be back and I will never eat the pad Thai again."}
{"text":"I like Thai food a lot, and I have tried almost all the Thai restaurants in Madison, even the divey ones that have since closed. One friend, who is a green curry fan, told me that you can tell the quality of the Thai restaurant cook by how well the green chicken curry turns out. Others say it's the Pad Thai.

My wife and I were hungry and in the area. We stopped because we hoped they had seating. While they have nice tables and chairs, the city health department won't license them for dining in the establishment. It's take out only.

I ordered a medium green chicken curry and she ordered a chicken Pad Thai because it was mild. My green curry came out the best I've had anywhere in Madison. It was medium, just the right level of chili pepper, and her dish was good too. Fresh and hot!

The place was busy with people going in and out for take out all the time.

I'm really happy that I found this place, and I plan to introduce it to others.  Needless to say I will be back."}
{"text":"Terrible service. We ordered for take out tonight and we had to wait at the restaurant on top of waiting when we first ordered at home. We got there to pick up and I had to ask them to acknowledge me to pay for my food. They change there serving sizes which is not good business but we wanted to give it one more try. We will drive farther thai places so we don't have to go here after this. After being ignored I asked for a small side of white rice and it took them 15 minutes just to give me some white rice which we all know they have it pre made. And to add they only had a couple people so it shouldn't have taken that long. Food is good but terrible service and portions are different every time. It's about the principle and I wont be coming back."}
{"text":"Yellow curry medium heat was delish!  Didn't quite burn my mouth but had enough kick."}
{"text":"If the waiter brings you new napkins without having to ask, I can totally respect them. It was my 5 y wedding anniversary and I wanted to try a restaurant I'd never been to. Had to get my fill of Thai. 

Why 3 stars? The appetizer soup was delish, the eggroll that comes with the entreé is yummy, but the eggplant dish I ordered was really bland. Generous for the price, yes, but very bland. (I ordered it mild, not dead.) Please note that the chai tea is not the American-style blended, froathy tea but just tea with a lot of ginger in it. That was good. Maybe one should just stick to appetizers and dessert??

As far as the atmosphere goes, it was memorable. Even on a Saturday, the place is quiet."}
{"text":"not the best thai i've ever had, but it got the job done; maybe i ordered the wrong dish. i went for lunch and had the pad see ew, which came with soup and a spring roll.  portions and prices were decent. if i were to visit phoenix again, would i come back? meh."}
{"text":"I just threw about $20 worth of their food in the trash. I will never go back.

I ordered 2 items to go. The chicken coconut soup had a great flavor so I was enchanted...at first.

Then as I stirred up the soup from the bottom of the container I found slices of chicken that were extremely chewy and bland, almost as if the meat was old.  Ok, I can eat around the chicken, I thought, but no....there were hard inedible shreds of lemongrass like floating pieces of straw that made the remainder of the soup unsalvageable.

Then I tried the Pad Pik King. Oh dear.  The string beans were partially cooked and very tough. I couldn't locate a single piece of beef that didn't have gristle in it. But hey, the plain white rice was okay and generous!
Don't bother.  Really."}
{"text":"Good pad thai, good sized servings. This is my favorite thai spot in the area."}
{"text":"This place used to be the best Thai food in all of Phoenix as far I was concerned. Thai basil has always been my favorite but less and less often is the food of any quality. Most recently I had ordered a simple Pad Thai with Shrimp. What I got was rehyderated rice noodles and two pieces of shrimp and tofu. There were hints of vegetables but no sauce what so ever and noodles on their own taste like soggy cardboard I have recently found out. I am a terrible cook but am confident in that I could have made better Pad Thai than what I was looking at. This is the straw that broke  this camels back. R.I.P. Thai Basil"}
{"text":"Love this place!  Atmosphere is really nice and well decorated.  Restaurant is clean and food quality is excellent.  Staff is very friendly and accommodating.

Pad thai is really big and I usually have to take half home, which makes for a really yummy lunch next day.  Coconut soup (my absolutely favourite) can be a bit too spicy, but they will make it mild as well.  Curries are also really good, creamy and always enough to last through the last bit of rice.  Food is mostly authentic, and very similar to what I've had in Thailand, although of course, tailored a bit to western tastes"}
{"text":"I love this place. I was first introduced to Thai Basil by a friend of my husband, and since then, I've been in love with their food ever since. The restaurant is nicely decorated. The food is what keeps me coming back. I love their curries, especially the Panang (coconut milk and peanut based) curry, Massuman (which traditionally has beef and peanuts as well), and their red curry, which tastes delicious with chicken or prawns. I noticed that they have red curry duck but have yet to try this. Their mango salad is delicious, with crispy onions. My family and I quite like the eggplant and tofu dish which has a nice basil flavour to it.
During my visit this evening we had red curry chicken and shrimp pad Thai. The noodles of the pad Thai stuck together more than I would have liked but at least they were not oily and the prawns were perfectly cooked. For these 2 dishes and a side of rice, our dinner cost $31. Well worth it when I felt I wanted to drink the last of the curry sauce after we ran out of rice!
We will definitely be back!

3.5 stars

 All we wanted to do was to grab something to eat after a long drive from California to Arizona and we found this on rurual road, in Tempe. The exterior may look plain but hey, there's a bar and happy hour happening so why turn around?

What does happy hour have? Well, well , well... 1/2 off appetizers, $2 blue moons and drafts that they carry. And there's specials on selected food.

Got the..

+ fresh rolls ($3) chicken - http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/7N3q70C_mwEYQ2QcGfjvgA?select=N1mhk603JkCFuPZJ58Cxew#mYLsvj4kSTgz7tqwKX07NQ 
You get to choose either chicken, beef or tofu. We got the chicken and it was pretty good. The sweet and sour sauce was a bit different from the Thai places I've been to. Usually there's garlic in it, but at Thai Basil, they put chopped up peanuts instead. So if you're allergic with peanuts, best ask for the sauce without the nuts!

+ Papaya Salad ($6.25) mild
Tasted great! Only sad thing is that we only had one shrimp :(

+ red snapper with mixed veggies and bamboo (mild) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/7N3q70C_mwEYQ2QcGfjvgA?select=vhgbwyKOgx0caLeacQ1zQQ#pD9KU2uHEGRBQS4H02AJEQ
Oh so yummy! Tasted garlic-y and having it over rice is delicious.

Service - Was great. The ladies who works there are very helpful when we asked what in what and they will let you know what's their special of the day. And yes, there is a bar here. Eat while you drink in front of a big screen t.v. 

Overall, not a bad place. I just wished they gave more than one darn shrimp!"}
{"text":"Super great food. Love the yellow curry and pad Thai. My mom and I order from here all the time and we have never had any mistakes or disappointments! Highly recommend:)"}
{"text":"I just came from here tonight and I had an AMAZING experience. I started my adventure with the lemon ginger tea (great, especially since I have a cold currently :( ) and then shared the dinner for two with a friend. The amount of food was perfect, the green curry was a nice level of spiciness and and left completely satisfied.

So far I think this is my favourite fairly cheap thai restaurant! Check it out if you haven't already!"}
{"text":"Awesome Thai in Richmond Hill

This place is a family dinner favorite spot and no wonder its all in the ingredients and experience

Try the Larb Lettuce Salad which is a lettuce wrap with minced chicken , thai herbs, lime and onions

Tom KhaTaley is their Coconut Seafood Soup

Mussamum Curry Beef Brisket offers up the meat that's simmered in curry with potatoes, peanuts and onions

Another special is the Mixed Seafood in Young Coconut . I guess this is a baby coconut shell that is full of stir fried seafood with coconut, basil, red peppers, carry and coconut milk. Its a delicious dish with an impressive presentation

Another different dish is the Spinach in Thai Black bean sauce. The spinach is stir fried for your pleasure

Now for the fried rice the Baked Pork and Olive Rice in a Hot Pot which includes cashews

What I love about this place is they have the usual Thai staple dishes but the chefs go above and beyond with interesting dishes for a refreshing dining experience

Service is quick and friendly and it can be noisy as family's laugh and chat during their tasty dinner

Generous portions means leftovers for the next day"}
{"text":"Portion size and prices were good. Friendly service. The food was just a bit spicy - not intolerably hot. The flavors were quite good but the food seemed a bit fattier than Thai food usually is, and my chicken green curry had only chicken and mushrooms - no other vegetables, except for two small chunks of tomato. But it was a good enough experience, and unique enough for Madison, that I'm sure I'll be back."}
{"text":"favorite thai place. cute atmosphere and nicely decorated. if im in the area I would def visit here.

I love the green curry, thai basil noodles, softshell crab with crispy basil, mince meat garlic eggplant, pineapple fried rice."}
{"text":"Decent thai in the wilderness of whitebread with mayo Phoenix.

Just so everyone knows by me saying it explicitly, this is four stars in Phoenix, and likely less everywhere else.  :D

They didn't fight me on wanting thai hot, so that's nice.  It's standard dry red chili flake dosage here.  Best I should expect around here anyway.

So yes.  It's a totally edible and as hot as you want it thai (which if you're a whiteboy like me, you know it's occasionally hard to get people to give you actually hot food).  You'll have no serious complaints and, it's likely the best around."}
{"text":"Went on a weekday night for dinner.  We ordered the fried calamari for appetizer, the Thai Basil signature dish with beef and the Pad Thai with chicken.  Everything was good.  The Thai Basil signature stood out as very flavorful and would return just to get another bite of that.  The Pad Thai had a very sweet flavor that I didn't care for.  Overall not a bad option to try in the Park Central Mall area."}
{"text":"My boyfriend is Thai and he agrees that the food is incredibly authentic! The crab rangoon are really good. Also, thai iced tea is not overly sweet and super awesome! The owner is very nice and is always there. He's the one with all the swaroski diamonds, lol. Very accomadating to your spicy needs."}
{"text":"Awesome Thai food. One of the best in town. And the coconut ice cream and fried plantains was hands-down the best Thai dessert I have ever tasted. Wonderful people too!"}
{"text":"The food was remarkable.  Good service and environment.  We got the coconut soup, peanut sauce steamed veggies and chicken, and pad Thai.  Excellent food."}
{"text":"If there was ten star I would do it for thai Basil the food is delicious especially the cheese roll is the best I had never have  in my life ."}
{"text":"Came to ASU for a conference and stayed at the Holiday Inn around the corner from this spot. Food and service was so good the first time, had to come back for seconds.

First time we came here was Happy Hour so they had discounted beers and food. We shared crispy egg rolls, cheese egg rolls, and so Pad Thai. It was all delicious. The cheese rolls were my favorite.

Second time around I had to try their version of my favorite Thai noodle, Pad See Eiw. It was lunch time so they had a special going on starting at $6.95. Lunch menu was simple, pick a noodle, pick a meat, comes with an egg roll. I choose Seafood combo (shrimp, calimari, scallops). Tasty!

If I'm ever in town again, I'd come back. Friendly service, affordable menu, good food."}
{"text":"Inexpensive and popular place, gets quite crowded at lunch.  We tried the Peanut Curry (Panang) with chicken, and the red curry with beef.  Service is good, and friendly.  Lunch specials come with a small egg roll, that is quite good, rice, and a light cup of soup.
Their scheme of spiciness is quite accurate in my opinion.  The Panang chicken was quite good, with more vegetables than I am accustomed to.  The red curry was tasty, but the beef was pretty chewy.  Guess I'm spoiled by the Thai in Los Angeles."}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise!  My husband will have absolutely nothing to do with sushi, so that leaves me with \"me time\" to have a good lunch and read a book - all by myself :)  I decided to try Thai Basil the other day, and found the sushi to be very good, but what caught my attention was the décor of this restaurant.  To say the least, it was so inviting with the big chairs with high backs and arm rests, I could have stayed all day!  My server was a delightful older man - look who's calling someone \"older\" - who was so accommodating and helpful, and I felt really welcome here!  One minor problem, the restaurant sits behind other stores in sort of a difficult area that is hard to access, but keep trying as it's definitely worth it.  I will be going back for their Thai food, and by the looks of those who were eating here, it should be very good!  Oh, I forgot to mention that I ordered two rolls of sushi and a side salad.  When my server brought over my bill he pointed out that they had a special going on for two rolls, and my bill was actually half of what I thought it should be!  Now that I like!"}
{"text":"Food:
I shouldn't have ordered the chicken fried rice but I was really craving some rice. The chicken in the chicken fried rice was excellent - flavourful, fragrant and just tasted oh so good! The fried rice itself was also really good and had a slight coconut taste to it that distinguishes it as a Thai fried rice dish. Although the dish that I ordered was good and did a really good job in filling me up, I don't really find it really special. It didn't stand out too much from other fried rice dishes other than the fact that the chicken was exceptionally well done. 

Ambiance:
Restaurant was nicely decorated and gave off a relaxing ambiance. It was almost like eating at a spa actually, given the Buddha themed decor, wooden furniture and warm coloured accents. 

Cleanliness: 
Clean restaurant and facilities.

Staff:
Friendly and accommodating staff. I appreciate the good service and the fact that my water glass was constantly being filled.

Would I come here again? Yes, but next time for one of their curry dishes."}
{"text":"On my first trip to Thai Basil, I was lucky enough to try the green curry with tofu. Hands down, the best Thai dish I've ever had, and I've eaten a LOT of Thai food. Literally, I have dreams about this green curry. I can't attest to any other dishes, as I've only been twice and had the green curry both times. But, wow. It's perfect."}
{"text":"I have had thai basil both in house and as take out. since i live right next to it, i am not sure how it stands up to long distance travel, but, i have always been happy with it when i got it home. 

for appetizers, try the fresh rolls, they are one of the better ones i have had in tempe. the spring rolls are also yummy, crisp and fresh tasting. 

if you ever have a craving for a strange soup that will clear anything out of your head, be it hangover or sinus infection, try the tom yum. its a spicy lemongrass broth soup with huge chunks of onion, mushrooms, and choice of meat or tofu. I love it with the beef. It is more than a full portion of soup, even if you share it, so come hungry. 

the pad thai, another classic choice, is tangy, sweet, and has a kick of spice that is just right. most places seem to use a peanut butter based sauce, but thai basil uses a nice tamarind based sauce and only garnish with peanuts, which are nice and roasted. tofu comes standard, but you can up the amount of tofu or add a meat of choice. 

the prices are fair, good sized portions, and great atmosphere when dining in. the service was great, and was always friendly. 

and for the adventurous drinker (non alcoholic) try the green tea chai. its bold, refreshing, and makes you just say \"..hmmmmm...\" but in a great way!"}
{"text":"Tonight must be a good night! 3rd review.  I've had too much time to eat. :(
Thai Basil.  An addiction I've gained from my last college dorm room mate.  It makes me sick as hell to eat it, but the yellow curry is AMAZING.  I don't even want Tofu in it, cause it ruins the coconut goodness.  Aside from the flaming hot veggies, it's pretty good on top of the jasmine rice.  The great part is, they give you more than enough to take home...and it's not bad cold either.  Asian food is never bad cold the next day *grins* The ice coffee and thai tea looks awesome...little too spicy for me. of course they choose to open one right next to my old dorm AFTER I leave. Typical Thai Basil...Typical. Try it out, it's yummy! Great for veggies and Vegans...even you poser vegans...you know who you are. Night!"}
{"text":"The best curry! I love nearby and eat here at least once a week. I've had 100+ curries from here and they have all turned out wonderful. Great price for the amount of food. Calling in to order pickup is fast too. I never have to wait more than 15 or 20 minutes to pick it up."}
{"text":"Best curry ever! I had the yellow curry and my boyfriend ordered the sweet nut curry. If you are a curry fan you will love this place!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch during training at Interface, I was feeling sick so I just wanted a soup with tons of vegetables.
They were friendly and fast.

I asked for a recommendation and I ended up ordering some sort of bean noodles soup... with lots of vegetables.

The only thing is that like mid lunch I realized the menu said the soup had mushroom and my bowl didn't have any. I got the attention of one of the servers and asked it about that.  He apologized an offered to get me some. I got a small bowl with mushrooms, when I put them in the bowl the soup was kind of cold for raw mushrooms, but my left over the next day were delicious : )

Good place for lunch."}
{"text":"Great food and friendly service no matter how busy it gets... Love this place!"}
{"text":"This is a good place to go get curry TAKE-OUTS.  Despite the remote location and the small dine-in area, the food is quite good in contrast to the restaurants appearance. I'm comparing this to Sai Bai-thong and Curry-in-a-box.  Sai Bai-thong is a bit over price for the volume and ingredients."}
{"text":"My family and I have eaten here for years, as it is close to our house.  Restaurant has a nice local following, and many of their diners are Take Out diners.  Their menu is limited but the items served is hot, fresh and flavorful.  My husband loves their sushi.

When you arrive, you are immediately greeted and seated.  Be sure to check the specials listed on the chalk board near the entrance.  I like the decor, and facility, dining plates, utensils and glasses are clean.

Staff is efficient and accommodating.  The menu is concise but has enough available for almost anyone.  Prices are reasonable and portions are above average.  Definitely will return."}
{"text":"I decided to pick up some food on my way home. I orders pinapple beef curry and pad thai. Both were very bland. Not at all spicy. The vegetables were completely raw in the curry. I ordered to go and it didnt take very long to get my food but would have waited longer to get food that was edible. Will not be going back."}
{"text":"Service is very nice.  The cooking though is uneven.  The dishes we had during our first and second visits were very good.  Our third visit was not as good."}
{"text":"Food was delicious, and I got great service from very nice people, at a great price! Took my girlfriend out, both got dinners, appetizer, beers, and we were out of there with a $35 bill. It wasn't very busy, which may be why we had so much attention paid to us, but I'm okay with it!"}
{"text":"Great place for take-out, though I like eating in as well! Awesome Thai food, and you can choose how spicy you want it. I love the panang curry (which is both sweet & spicy) and the chicken pad thai. Super fast service (our food was done in ~7min!) and friendly staff who make every effort to be accommodating. I've brought parents, boyfriends, and friends here and they all love it."}
{"text":"Food was mediocre at best. I got the drunken noodles and the chicken potstickers. There were too many bamboo shoots in my drunken noodles and it wasn't as flavorful. I have had better. The potstickers were alright."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have become regulars. We LOVE this place. Be sure to try their dragon roll! It's phenomenal! Their eel sauce is super delicious!"}
{"text":"Yes,yes, and yes! After moving here from Denver 3 years ago I was desperate to find a good Thai place. Fortunately the first place I tried was Thai Basil, unfortunately it was not the last. After trying at least 3 other Thai places, Thai Basil still has the best Pad Thai in Madison. Regular is delicious and if you say you want it spicy then expect it to be spicy! Noddles are never soggy or mushy like other places we've tried. Price is great and the service is always friendly. Even after we moved from Fitchburg to near down town, we still make the drive and it's well worth it."}
{"text":"I ordered the Peanut Panang Chicken.... I rqstd to the waitress that I wanted extra Bell Pepper. When it came, it had -NO- Bell Peppers at all.... i actually didn't realize this until about 5 mins into eating it. could not find our waitress, I waited about 7 mins, finally, I had to get up & search for her. I found another waiter & told him my problem. He took my Dish, but then came back to tell me that they are \"All out of Green Bell Peppers. Would I like Red Bell Peppers\". I said yes, of course.  This whole experience has put a sour taste in my mouth about this place, which is next door to the 'mediocre' Good Egg on Central.   I like Wild Thaiger on Central MUCH better instead!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  They know how to make the food and the service is great too..  Kid friendly and great ambience! Their green curry is awesome and also their pineapple fried rice!"}
{"text":"I wasn't a fan of the Orange Chicken and servers were rude which was surprising for Thai restaurant.  Thai was not authentic at all.  I've had better!"}
{"text":"My second fav Thai food place in downtown Toronto. They have great food, awesome variety, good service and quite nice ambiance - quite a good overall package. I usually go there for dinner and I'm never disappointed!"}
{"text":"this place is on our way to our recent thai favorite place, so instead of going routine, we opted to meet some friends and eat here instead. 

first thing you'll notice is no alcohol. which put me off at first, but after dinner, i was glad i didn't have any beers to bloat me up. the menu is small compared to most asian style restaurants. being ever adventurous, i went with something i haven't ordered before, the restaurants namesake, the thai basil. 

i should have stuck with my usual curry, pad thai, or pad see ew. it was good, but it just tasted like vegetables with some basil. maybe that's the point? i don't know because i've never had it, but in any event, it wasn't my favorite. the side of brown rice was good though. i did order an app of the fresh spring rolls which were tasty, with two dipping sauces. 

my wife wasn't impressed by her seafood vegetables, stating it tasted like bagged salad underneath pre-bagged/frozen seafood. 

service was prompt and friendly.

they probably have other good dishes, but we just happened to order 2 we didn't care for."}
{"text":"The Thai Basil was really delicious, even reheated as left overs it was still just as flavorful. This place does Thai food right!"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE PLACE CAUTION DO NOT GO!

I ordered a mango, papaya and prawn salad to go and was charged for it, the waitress then informed me the wait is 15 mins for a salad. 

I came back 15 minutes later and she told me she charged me for a green mango salad by accident and I have to pay the extra charge. Then made me wait another 10 minutes while they fixed my order. The waitress basically shamed me into paying by saying oh it's just two dollars, my mistake, just pay it in front of 3 other customers. 

When the order was finally ready I walked out with it, but checked it at my car because I had a bad feeling about the place, it turns out they messed up the order again and gave me a papaya salad. 

I went inside and expressed my frustration, and although the waitress fixed my order, she was extremely rude. She basically threw the salad at me and when I asked why it was so fast this time, she said they just toss it it's very fast. Then yelled, \"you wanted a fresh one? Huh? The wait time is still the same!\" 

As for the salad ( see photo) goddamit do they know what prawns are? And there were only two in the entire salad, funny cuz I paid 2 dollars extra??? The mangoes were mushy, like thawed Costco mangos... Absolutely disgusting place and food I will never go back. 

While in line I chatted with other customers who reflect similar experiences, avoid this place at all costs!"}
{"text":"Been to this location of Thai Basil quite a few times, usually for lunch. Their dinner service is a lot busier than their lunch, and there's a lengthy wait if you walk in without reservations. The decor of the restaurant is nice and very classically Thai inspired. They have both booth and chair & table seating available. The food and the service is where it is a real hit or miss. Judging from my many visits, I'd say that both miss the mark 40% of the time, which is quite a lot.

Their customer service is usually friendly to begin with but can go downhill really fast when it gets busy and depending on how much staff they have working. During the less busy lunch hours, the service is mostly friendly and efficient. On the other hand, for dinner, the efficiency of service goes down by a lot. Everything from placing your food order to asking for the bill results in quite the wait. Perhaps they should staff more servers during the busier dinner hours....

The food is great most of the time, however sometimes even their staple dishes are a major miss. When done right, their tom yum soup bowls are delicious and have the perfect balance between spicy and sour. But when it misses the mark, the soup is usually way too sour and barely spicy. Being a Thai restaurant, their kitchen should have the flavours of their staple dishes nailed down to a tee. The same can be said for their noodle dishes; sometimes the seasoning is on point and tasty while other times it's too sour or bland. 

The only consistent dish I've ever had here is their beef and chicken skewers with peanut dip. It's always delicious. Everything else I've ever had is a hit or miss. Thai Basil just needs to improve and get to a more stable level of consistency with their food and service. Ultimately, I'd still return for a meal or two (preferably lunch), however I would definitely bring it to their attention if the food I order isn't seasoned or cooked properly. Hopefully, customer feedback can help them improve and be more consistent."}
{"text":"If you can, go over to Rural and eat at the other location. The pricing, given the small portioning, is like a dry booger on the roof of my nostril--irritating and unreasonable. The staff have the friendliness of a video game NPC. It's like talking to soulless shells."}
{"text":"I love the curries, the Pad Thai, and the fried banana ice cream dessert is amazing. The Thai tea is quite good, too. 

On the other hand, I've experienced terrible service on maybe 9 out of every 10 visits. I've gone through many meals where they never fill your water, even when asked. Some of the staff is nice enough, they just seem to be bad at their jobs. Although, I have been served by people who seem to be on a perpetual period. They drop your food with loud clangs and make eye contact only if they're tipped. I've sat waiting for 45 minutes on a day where my wife and I were in an almost empty restaurant."}
{"text":"I have been at this Thai Basil more than a couple of times, but today will be the last time. I was seated on the far right table close to the kitchen by the wall. I was enjoying the peanut curry with Thai tea. As I was finishing up my meal, I had a weird feeling and looked at the wall to my right to see a disgusting roach I quickly moved over and looked up to the wall behind me to find 2 other small roaches.... I almost puked! PLEASE if you care for your health DO NOT HEAT HERE."}
{"text":"My uncle manages a hotel in the area, and told me to check out this place. I took a friend out one night and haven't stopped going back ever since! Every dish I've ordered has been delicious. (Try the Panang Curry!)

Service can be a little slow when things start to get busy, as they often do, but all the waitresses are friendly and attentive. At this moment, it's been several weeks since I've been here, and writing this review is making me want to head back tonight!"}
{"text":"Another one of my favorite places that I have to fight off the urge to eat there three times a week. I want to be careful not to get sick of it which would be devastating!

I love the yellow curry/pork and the pad Thai/pork. Ordered many times, consistent and very good! 

I have found that pad Thai is the key to a good Thai place. Been to many all over the place. Some places it just looks, off, and smells, hmmmm off, but this particular place it is just \"fresher\" I don't know how to describe it. This place serves as my standard for pad Thai quality so yes, good food and love it.

Also, ordered the fresh rolls many many times. The ones with avocado (girlfriend doesn't like meats) we have had many times. Huge and very yummy. I like the open end with the lettuce hanging out, nice touch because you can see that the fresh roll is in fact \"fresh\" before you even bite into it. Love it.

Recommended! There are other locations, not positive about affiliation, but I always go to this one and never disappoints. 

Staff and location is fine. Good energy in here."}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant for 3 times already and was happy each time. The food is great and the prices are affordable. Very recommended if you're looking for a casual tasty meal."}
{"text":"Whenever I come to Thai Basil I feel like the staff are very happy and welcoming they suit you nicely and are very attentive to your needs.

The food is also very consistent I really like the panang curry or the green or yellow curry. The pa thai is also pretty good.

 recommend for family and friends"}
{"text":"Cant go wrong with HAPPY HOUR. $5 or $6 a plate. But if you decide to order from the menu(regular price) they will give you a big portion. So worth the money! Family can totally share. Staffs are all friendly as well."}
{"text":"Good curry. Liked the thai style spider roll. Wife said the chinese was good. something for everyone you should try it!"}
{"text":"I chose the pork fried rice from their lunch menu, the pork fried rice was good, but I've had better. The staff were very patient and friendly. 

I'll defintely go back here again to try their other dishes."}
{"text":"This was weird. I found them on Yelp and called to make sure they were open. \"Yes\"-hang up. Um, what? Do you not want my business? We went anyway, which is rare because I am stubborn about those things, but the pictures looked really good. When I walked in, they just stared at me. I had to ask for a menu. And water. It was so weird. We joked that you must have to be a regular or VIP to get attention around here.. When the food came, no doubt it was delicious. The ambiance is nice, but I'm not going to go out of my way to go here again because it felt like I was intruding on them or something.

They earn stars for: high quality food, open late, parking. They lose stars for: bad service, no liquor license."}
{"text":"We ordered take out because I was craving pad thai but to be quite honest the pad thai was quite disappointing, it really wasn't authentic and there was nothing special about it. The spring roll weren't too bad. I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"One of the best Thai restaurants I've tried. Busy on a Saturday evening, with a very high proportion of Asian diners.  I could tell right away that this was a good choice.

I started with the Wonton Soup.  It is different than the true Chinese version but just as good, with a flavourful broth, and tender wontons.  The Panang Curry beef was as advertised, a wonderful curry flavour and beef brisket.  Although I would not normally order eggplant, my associate ordered the Thai Basil Eggplant with Tofu.  It was also amazingly flavourful.

The real surprise was the Mango Sticky Rice.  Several sweet and ripe mango halves were  accompanied by white and black sticky rice, and a small cup of coconut milk to pour over the rice.  Subtly sweet, chewy, al dente, fresh and vibrant, it was a perfect end to a great meal.

The menu is diverse and enticing.  This is a restaurant you need to visit many times.  I will!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. Pad Thai, drunken noodle, chicken friend rice, pineapple fried rice, and peanut curry I would all highly recommend. I used to come here all the time in college & now that I live in Tempe again I'm a regular again."}
{"text":"Consistently good and fresh.  Great for lunch, although it is always crowded (because it is yummy).  Service is pretty fast and they cater to the business lunch crowd with their fast service.  Typically, we arrive and grab a seat inside or out, and someone comes by and drops off a small salad before we have a chance to exhale.  They charge a buck fifty for the brown rice, which I don't care because rice, and they will spice it up or down to your taste.  Signature Thai Basil dish is always a winner.   Tell em Candi sent you."}
{"text":"Simple and delicious Thai food. Keep in mind that unless you say otherwise they will make it spicy to their preference."}
{"text":"Amazing! Super high quality and delicious food!! If you are an ASU staff or faculty looking for a place open during summer/breaks this is it!!"}
{"text":"Thai Basil straddles the middle ground between Pei Wei and Malee's on Main. 

The prices are probably the most memorable thing about this restaurant.  At $6.95, Thai Basil might be the cheapest Thai dinner I've had.  

The food is good also.  The vegetables are fresh, the sauces and curries are powerful and tasty.  As some others have noted, the biggest problem with the food is that there's nothing to say about it.  It's not bad at all.  In fact, the Thai Basil Chicken and Spicy Noodles were both quite good.  However, they taste much like every other Thai place I've been to.  The food is good, but not a standout.

I will offer one complaint.  The restaurant is small.  Too small for the number of tables and waitstaff.  The result is a relatively cramped feeling.  Last time I ate there, my company and I were hustled out of the restaurant to make room for more patrons."}
{"text":"Good, yet not spectacular, Thai food.  The combination sampler had tasty, greasy fried spring rolls in a lovely sweet and sour sauce.  Chicken skewers in peanut sauce and fried potatoes.  I enjoyed them all but that part of the meal was not extremely impressive.

My husband and I both ordered the Red Curry with a spicy level of hot and our friend ordered the Garlic Chicken.  While the red curry was pretty good, it definitely was not hot, so get the extra hot if you are serious about your spiciness.  Service was prompt but note that they do not have a liquor license so don't ask for booze.  This was a great, quick place to grab some dinner but falls a little short compared to other Thai cuisine I have had."}
{"text":"Nice location close to the \"airport\" hotels near University Drive.  If you are tired of hotel food just drive east on University.  The food is ok it has a nice spice mixture.  It does lacks that bite that most Thai food has but I find that most Thai places have \"dummy\" their food down to appeal to a larger base.  It is worth the trip down the road."}
{"text":"Ordered seafood curry...1 shrimp and 3 squid pieces.
Ordered shrimp pad thai...3 shrimps and some tofu.
Crab puffs.
Unless you are high and have the munchies, this is not worth 40 bucks."}
{"text":"this is a pretty nice restaurant for thai food. i really like the decoration inside because it somewhat makes you feel like you're at an authentic thai restaurant. i come here quite often and most of the time i would order the thai bbq pork. (im not a huge fan of the other food too much because i usually hate how some thai food taste sweet to me like homie i would rather just eat a dessert and go xD) this is a part of their lunch combo and so it comes with a bowl of tom yum soup and two spring rolls .. 

moving on to the taste of the bbq pork, it's really good! the meat is chewy and a little crispy on the outside which really brings the whole thing together. there's this nice sweet and spicy sauce that you can eat along with the rice or pork! rly good 

whenever i feel like splurging, i would get the beef (or pork i don't really remember which). if you get two kebabs it comes with this really bombass peanut sauce. goes absolutely beautiful with the taste of the kebabs MMMMMMM"}
{"text":"This place is great. The menu is huge, and the items are all really different, so you have tons of options. I prefer the sweet curries, so panang and musaman are my favorites. I'm also a vegetarian and they make great tofu! The fried rice is another big favorite of mine!"}
{"text":"Ordered pad Thai take out today.
It was tasteless. Pad Thai should be a signature dish full of flavour. Sadly I couldn't even eat it."}
{"text":"food's alright. satisfies my sushi craving when im lazy. they deliver. chinese food is bleh, okay. not awesome."}
{"text":"It's not very often that you come across a Thai/Sushi/Chinese place all in one!

Thai Basil is hidden behind a small strip mall and Chevron gas station on the north east corner of Ann Rd and Simmons.  

Very traditional asian feel with the interior decor.  Very clean.   

I tried my very first sushi here at Thai Basil many years ago.  Yellowtail and salmon nigiri to be exact.  I had the super white tuna again when I went last week.  The super white tuna nigiri is fish on rice with a small amount of wasabi in the middle and (idk what kind of) sauce on top.  The small amount of wasabi in the center between the tuna and rice gave a nice kick to it = awesomeness!

Other than sushi, I tried the Hong Kong Noodles, which includes shrimp, chicken, bbq pork, mushrooms, bok choy, broccoli, and brown sauce.  My favorite part is the crispy thin noodles.  Way better than soft noodles.  Not every chinese restaurant can make good hong kong noodles, but this being a \"thai\" place, they did a great job!  I would definitely get it again.  

I also had the beef panang and pad thai.      

I would say that the size of the dishes were sharable.  They give you a good amount.  That being said, prices are reasonable.    

Thai Basil has a lot to offer."}
{"text":"Good fast dependable.  Not the most authentic, but it's at Park Central, what did you expect?  Given the choices there, I'd happily go to Thai Basil over the Good Egg or Starbucks."}
{"text":"Great service, great food.  Why can't I get Thai food this good in Palm Springs?  Fresh, tasty and authentic ingredients."}
{"text":"I come here for the best coconut soup in the East Valley 'Tom Kha' with chicken. Delicious for lunch or dinner and with white rice makes it perfect. It comes with onion, mushrooms, light to heavy spices based on your order, and you can order chicken- beef or shrimp.

It is a little pricey for a soup but well worth it. Their lunch menu is also a deal. I approve."}
{"text":"I grew up eating amazing Thai food at a little place in the Bay Area. Thai iced tea and crystal noodles hold a special place in my heart. That said I really haven't found a Thai place in AZ that I've been crazy about yet. Thai Basil has changed that.
We decided to try them on a whim as I had a craving for chicken satay and a menu happened to be in our junk drawer magically. This location is relatively new but Yelp reviews seemed favorable so we gave it a shot. Definitely satisfied the craving and won some Thai food newbies over as well.
I agree with the reviewer who said the portions were huge! We ordered 4 orders of chicken satay, a chicken pad thai, and a side of crystal noodles for take out. It was ready in a quick 10 minutes, and was more than enough food for all 5 of us to split. Also ordered two Thai iced teas and our total was still less than $60 with tip(yes, I tip even with take out!). 
Was very impressed with the service and the food. The actual dining room seemed a bit informal but probably wouldn't be a terrible place to eat in. Thai Basil offers delivery to my area so my lazy butt might never actually find the need to!"}
{"text":"I came here with my family.  They were visiting from the mid-west and they were wanting something \"different\".  Considering I grew up in the mid-west, I thought this place would not be too different for their palates. 

I've been here a couple of times before but bringing them made everyone quite happy.  Most of them ordered the Pad Thai and I stuck to my usual curry.  All very good, food wise, this is a great place.

With that said, parking is horrendous if it's busy.  They simply do not have the room for their clientele when it gets busy.  It was really nice to see someone (manager/owner?) trying to assist outside with parking which shoes they do care about their customers."}
{"text":"I enjoyed their tum yum soup. Their pad sew was okay. I have had better. It was just dry and had no flavor. This was my first time here and decided to do a take out."}
{"text":"I really like Thai Basil because every time we come here the food is tasty and the staff is very friendly. It's great for take out or to eat there. 

If you go to Thai Basil, you have to try their signature salad dressing. It's so good it's like liquid crack! I was so happy to see that they know sell the salad dressing for take home (it's $5 and you get a good amount).

For dinner, I decided to try something different so I ordered the Spicy Noodles. It was really good with chicken, panfried rice noodles, and a variety of vegetables. You can really tell they use fresh vegetables and good ingredients. While the dish was delicious I would have liked it a little bit more spicy, especially with a name like \"Spicy Noodles.\" I have had all there curries and they are all terrific but the best one is the yellow curry."}
{"text":"UPDATE:  2 weeks later - Tried two other dishes

Pad See Ew:  Edible, but nothing to write home about.  Everything was a little dry starting with the noodles and onto the chicken.

Green chicken curry:  Also edible, but nothing to write home about.  Chicken is dry and the dish itself is incredibly plain.  Other than chicken and curry sauce, they include one soggy slice of eggplant.  No red peppers, even though it's on the menu.  

I've downgraded Thai Basil from 4 stars to 3 stars"}
{"text":"No less than 30% of my measure of a great Thai restaurant is their Thai iced tea.  This place serves it to you in a giant glass and lets you mix the tea and cream yourself - which is just fun.  Add to this nice quick service and a simple delicious menu and you've got a winner.  I am a sucker for Pad See-Ew with pork and this was a nice ratio of noodle / veg / protein - I had enough to take home for later.  I got it \"Thai hot\" which is like five stars or something, it was just right.  I will be back without question and recommend this to anyone who needs a Thai fix."}
{"text":"Excellent food.  Excellent service.  Good prices.  

The place was clean, even the restroom.  The staff was friendly, efficient and attentive.  The decor was, well, like a Thai restaurant.  Tables were comfy.  

I was impressed by the one page menu.  Really.  If you're going to open a restaurant, keep the menu short, and hit home runs with every dish.  And boy, did they!  We came as a family of 5, ordering 4 different dishes, so, we were able to sample a variety of their offerings; Thai Basil, Pad Thai, Eggplant Something Or Other, and BBQ Chicken...all excellent.  The spices and flavors were PERFECT.  It was some of, the best Thai food I've had in a long, long time."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday evening and the server wasn't too excited about having new guests after 8pm. However, we got seated, got the menu and ordered a Mango Margarita, the Coconut Soup with Chicken, the Curry with Duck and Pad Thai with Shrimps. 

Let's start with the Margarita..no flavor at all and alcohol? Nope..nothing. Taste was more like Green Tea or something similar.
The food continued the same..the Soup was way too sweet, guess someone mixed up Coconut Milk and Cream. 
The flavor of the Curry was nice and spicy but come on.. grapes and curry?! But okay, maybe people like this combination. 
The Pad Thai was the biggest desaster. Absolutely no flavor. I love Thai Food and the quality always differs but this was just dissapointing. I used some of the Curry Sauce from the other dish to put some flavor on.
Whoever is cooking in this kitchen should learn some basics."}
{"text":"I worked at a Thai restaurant for four months before moving down to Phoenix and was really craving some yummy Thai food. We were seated, waited a while for the drinks (no biggie), kind of an awkward exchange before ordering food (no biggie.) The fresh rolls were delicious, fresh, the sauces were really yummy. I ordered the Yum Woon Sen, which I had before at the restaurant I'd worked at (not a Thai Basil restaurant) but I knew that every place was going to be different, so I was curious to see how it tasted there. My husband orders the orange chicken.

The Yum Woon Sen (it's a salad) comes out. I'd ordered it without chicken but it came out with chicken (still, no biggie. It's not like I hate chicken.) I put some on my plate, and I smell this weird smell, but I'm like, whatever, Yum Woon Sen has always been delicious before. I take a bite and there is this OVERWHELMING fish flavor, like half a bottle of fish sauce had been dumped in there. My husband tastes it and agrees it's rank so we put it to the side. 

The orange chicken is okay. It essentially tastes like Panda Express, chewy, small pieces of chicken with tough breading - not what we were looking for. The chicken tasted like it had been breaded and frozen, not fresh, and the vegetables sat on the side looking sad and uninspired. But it was edible, so we ate it. 

The waitress comes by and asks us how it is and I tell her about the Yum Woon Sen. \"It's just got this overwhelming fish flavor, which I didn't expect since it's a chicken dish, and I really don't like it and don't want it.\" She asks if I want something else. I say no. She says, are you sure? You don't want a chicken salad? No. She takes the plate. I figure I'm kind of done experimenting since that one turned out so badly. My husband and I eat the orange chicken and at the end she the check.

\"The manager took 15% off,\" she says. I think, oh, wow, on top of taking off the dish? That's so nice. 

No. The guy took of 15% of the total check. 

When she comes back I say, \"I know this isn't your fault, but he only took off 15%? He didn't take off the dish?\" 

\"No.\"

\"Can I talk to your manager then?\" She tells me he's up at the cash register.

I explain the situation to him and ask why he only took 15% off.
\"We can't just give out free food here. You can't just try this, I don't like it, try that, I don't like it.\"

WHAT?!

I argue, tell him it tasted like fish - \"but there's no fish in it (not entirely accurate since there was shrimp in it)\" YEAH. I know. Which is why it shouldn't have tasted like fish.

Eventually he very grumpily takes the meal off, still complaining that he can't just give away free food, we pay and leave. 

We won't be going back. The food was mediocre and that Yum Woon Sen was really gross. We would have considered going back just for the fresh rolls if he hadn't been so rude and stingy. Whether you're Burger King or a five star restaurant, if a patron tastes the food, thinks it's gross, and gives it back, YOU DO NOT CHARGE THEM FOR IT. If you can't afford to lose $8 worth of food (really, less than that since you're only losing the cost) to keep a customer, then you shouldn't be in business."}
{"text":"The soup and egg rolls that come with the lunch menu are super good. If you get a soda, it's just a can so it's definitely overpriced and not worth it. 

Very fast service."}
{"text":"Thai Basil is the business! Very authentic and have a vast variety of Asian cuisine. It says Thai and Chinese but they definitely have a lot of Japanese influence. There is bit of a language barrier so I have had an order messed up a few times, but the quality of their food speaks volumes. I always get the veggie roll (because I'm a vegetarian) and I ask them to put tempura crunch on it and cream cheese inside sometimes. It is really good, but one thing that bothers me about it is the lack of consistency. Every time I order it, it's different! I never know exactly what I'm going to get. Aside from that, the tempura and fried tofu is always very good. If you love strong coffee, try the Thai iced coffee! Oh. My. God. It is BOMB. The staff is always very nice, patient and helpful. They go out of their way to make something just the way you like it, which is what keeps customers like me coming back."}
{"text":"Warning: when you tell your friend to meet you at Thai Basil -- always always be sure to coordinate to the correct Thai Basil!

Why!? Because there are so many Thai Basils in the valley it can be confusing.  Fortunately, this one is close by 2 other ones so I wasn't too off!

Seriously someone needs to change their name and differentiate themselves.  No alcoholic beverages at this location, so no Phuket beer for you!  I wonder how they make the drunken noodles here. Wink!  Not to worry still got pretty good food here.  I think Thai Basil is starting to become the McDonalds of Thai food. I ordered me a Mc-Pad See-Ew with chicken; no super-size for me.  If you need a quick Thai fix this will do the job.  However, if you wish to be wowed and powed; I suggest moving on.  My friend ordered the tofu fried rice and she really enjoyed it so I guess it could be a hit or miss, but still I'm the one reviewing haha!    

Service was good and the ambience -- well pretty simple Thai decor.  No Panangburgler? - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Haven't been here in a while, but my family was looking for some thai food. Needless to say, the portions are small, the beef / chicken tasted as though it was microwaved, and the curry was watered down (seemed like microwave mix almost). The price definitely does not justify the quantity/quality... If you're looking for something remotely close to authentic, I'd suggest looking elsewhere."}
{"text":"It wasn't bad, but I've had better Thai food. I ordered Pad Thai and Thai Tea that was brought it to me in a to-go box (not sure why they assumed it was to-go...)

The flavor was right but the noodles seemed a little soggier than normal. The portion size was good enough and the spring roll was a nice added bonus. I'll probably stop in again sometime if I'm hungry and nearby."}
{"text":"Food is delicious, good prices and nice people. Perfect combination..."}
{"text":"Pretty good for that authentic taste! Very nice inside and very clean. The owner is very nice and the pricing is great! Definitely will come back again!"}
{"text":"I got the Pad Thai from here and it was yummy. The egg rolls could of had a bigger presence od veggies all you could see was the noodle filling. The guy at the front counter was great, friendly and helpful guiding us through the menu.  I will be back to try it again."}
{"text":"I love Thai Basil. It is fast, reasonably priced and, best of all, delicious. One thing that is really great is they have a lunch special for $6.95 that includes a cup of a vegetable broth soup, entrée and egg roll (the menu said \"fruit\" also, but it's really just a slice of orange to drizzle on your entrée, which is a nice touch). I think their Thai iced tea is fabulous also. It's a classy place and yet feels very comfortable, and you know it must be good because a lot of people of Asian descent eat here on a regular basis. My favorite dishes are the noodle ones, like pad thai and pad-see-ew, hubby likes the rice dishes, but we both go for the tofu. It's nice to be able to eat totally vegetarian and have a delicious filling meal. If you're like us, you'll go back again and again."}
{"text":"Went there to try the mango sticky rice with my boyfriend on a Sunday morning, but we were told it was already sold out at 12pm. Considering the store open at 11:30am, I am so disappointed."}
{"text":"Holy Thai Food!!!  This place was amazing.  Quick turn around after we called in our to-go order was topped by the delicious food.  We ordered the Eggplant Garlic with tofu (no meat) and the Red Curry with chicken!  Both were amazing and so different in flavors.  My meal (the Eggplant Garlic) had gigantic, luscious pieces of  Japanese Eggplant.  I will be going back for sure.  Next time it will be the Red Curry (hot) with Tofu.  Can't wait!!"}
{"text":"This is our all time favorite Thai restaurant in Az. They have a few Thai Basil in the Phoenix metro area, but this one is our favorite. I usually get the red curry- the vegetables in it are cooked just right and their vegetables are always fresh. The yellow curry is perfect with brown rice. The Thai iced tea with sweet cream is amazing.  Their sticky rice and mango is delicious- they make it with the purple rice. Unique and satisfying!  They have a great appetizer combo with satay chicken, fried tofu, tempura sweet potato and spring rolls. I sometimes order this as my meal. Their Pad Thai is perfectly put together. They add the right amount of sauce, unlike some place that drown the noodles with sauce and all you taste is sauce. The veggies on top of the noodles are fresh and tender. Lastly the papaya salad- awh is perfect as well. They add the jumbo shrimp on top along with wedges of tomatoes"}
{"text":"Decent papaya salad. Awesome after they added more herbs and spice. Perfect pad Thai. Not the best service at the bar."}
{"text":"The bad reviews about this place make me sad. I am in love with Thai food after a trip to LA, and everywhere I've gone in Vegas isn't even comparable! We've gone to more popular places with better reviews and I honestly thought they weren't that great. The spicy drunken noodles from Thai basil were absolutely amazing! My boyfriend got another dish and he absolutely loved it as well. It was clean, quick, and had SUCH great food! I'm so happy a place like this is near my house! This is easily my favorite restaurant in Vegas!"}
{"text":"I've been to allot of Thai places, and this is my favorite in town. This is also my favorite of the Thai Basils in the area because they are more heavy-handed with their spice. (If you don't like your Thai that hot, go to the one of University.) They have the best lettuce wraps in town (forget P.F. Chang's), and they also are willing to grab your extra lettuce as they are more than generous with the chicken. Their Tom Ka Ga is amazing and light, with the most incredible little porcini mushrooms floating about. My favorite is the eggplant dish, medium, with tofu. (I'm not vegetarian; I just really love the way they fry their tofu.) Everything I have had, though, is incredible, and you cannot go wrong.

This is also a great place for large parties. We've shown up last minute with 12-15 people, and they accommodated us without hesitation. They also have great memories, and if you, like me, have a favorite, they will remember it :) 

PS Get the Thai iced tea to heal the burn."}
{"text":"Possibly the best fried rice we've ever eaten.  In town for just two nights and this place was so good, we ate dinner here both nights.  We got the Spring rolls and the Thai fried rice both nights.  The pad Thai and pineapple fried rice were both good, too. We ordered \"medium\" for the spice level - it was maybe a little too spicy for our daughter but a good compromise for one of us who likes a moderate heat level and the other who usually wants the spiciest possible. Great prices for the portions and friendly customer service. We'd definitely come back again."}
{"text":"First time I came here with a friend, I got a combo dinner for 2, which comes with spring rolls, salad and a choice of 2 entrees. We got pad thai and vegetable green curry. The pad thai was very average, curry wasn't bad. Mango salad was not fresh, mango wasn't ripe yet and was pretty firm, so I really didn't like it. The service here is very bad. 
Yesterday I came here for the last time. We ordered Tom Kha Valay (seafood coconut soup) and Tom Kha Kai (chicken coconut). The soup itself was the same, they just threw chicken in one \"broth\" and seafood (weird, really) in the other. I couldn't finish it at all. The mixture is like water mixed with coconut milk from can. It was extremely sour and coconut barely tasted at all. Not even to mention one shrimp, the rest were some weird spongelike seafood, that i decided not to eat. 
The yellow curry was alright, but not a lot for a price. Service wasn't great again.
I wouldn't come here."}
{"text":"I just have to say why can't we have a Thai place this good in Old Town Scottsdale?  I drove my self down there for the family on football bowl day and fought the traffic just for a piece of this sweet action.  Friendly, fast service, excellent prices, and a-mazing food.  The mints are the soft chalky kind too:)  Please open one to the north Thai Basil?"}
{"text":"Had the basil signature dish and the drunken noodle, both were just average."}
{"text":"Awesome Thai food and not too expensive. I had the coconut soup, and hubby had red curry. The coconut soup was full of basil and lemongrass. The flavor was so strong it took me by surprise, but was delicious once I got used to it. It was just slightly over-salted though. The fried spring rolls were great and came with what tasted like homemade sweet and sour sauce.

The restaurant was not busy at all for a Saturday night, but there were people coming and going pretty regularly. Even so, the atmosphere was very quiet, which was nice."}
{"text":"Pretty good. I had spring rolls and green shrimp curry bowl. Initially the portion didn't look that big but by the time I finished it I was stuffed. I ordered it with the mild spice and still had a good bit of kick to it. So I would say my meal was very good overall. We both got The Thai iced tea, and we both liked that.

My wife got the tofu pad Thai. She said the tofu was overcooked and not real flavorful. She would rate the food quality as merely average.

The service was friendly and prompt."}
{"text":"The exterior of this place is misleading - I walked inside expecting a dimly-lit dive-feeling place, but it's nicely decorated and pretty clean. The menu is relatively simple, too. I was warned that Thai spice is not to be taken lightly, so I ordered my noodles \"low spice,\" which I was told was a 2-3 on the 10-point scale, but they didn't taste spicy at all! Next time I'll try medium spice."}
{"text":"This place has been open for awhile now. First time there, wasn't a memorable experience. After a long time, this was my second time and boy has it changed. 

Nice and comfortable seating area, nice utensils and great attentive service. 

Food was delicious. We ordered thai platter, green curry chicken, coconut rice and pad Thai. 

Thai platter was proportionate (shared between 5 ppl)..sauces included was quite flavourful. 

Green curry was also delicious, the spicy taste was an after taste. We also ordered coconut rice served with it. 

Young coconut rice was creamy up to par. Served in a young coconut. Delish! 

Pad Thai was an a-ok..had better elsewhere. 

Desserts: tapioca cakes and coconut overall cream was good. Tapioca cakes were a little over sweet. 

Service was attentive and food was quite good. 

All in all, this could possibly be one of the better Thai restaurants uptown."}
{"text":"I've come here on multiple occasions, trying various dishes and I always want to come back. Their food is solid for a reasonable price. Decor is nice and service is always pleasant.

Its always a staple restaurant to go to on my visits home. Double thumbs up."}
{"text":"Thai Basil, coming from a chef this is indeed a Michelin star quality establishment. The food is top notch, you won't find anything like it in the GTA. Green curry is unlike anything I've had before. 

To top it off the service is far too good to be true. No matter how many times I try to let my cup run dry it never happens."}
{"text":"Friendly service. Quick order process. Great food. Perfect lunch spot!
Love this place and their super friendly service, everyone was smiling even though we got there in the middle of a lunch rush. Service was very fast as well, didn't wait very long for drinks or food. They even give you a small vegetarian soup (sampler sized almost) as an appetizer while you wait to place drink/food orders - very cool! 
The food was great, and good sized lunch portions. Also, their Thai Ice Tea is amazing - try it!"}
{"text":"I have withdrawals now that I've tasted their crispy shrimp pancakes! I keep going back for those...I find sometimes they taste better when you get take away and eat them a few hours later. For under $10...its a great snack to pick up when you're feeling peckish"}
{"text":"Have been here several times now and its without a doubt one of the better Thai places I've been to in the US. 

We ordered the spring rolls, pork rice and pad thai (both medium spice).

I LOVE Thai food and Thai Basil was not a let down at all. This restaurant was priced well and the food was very authentic and delicious! I don't really have anything negative to say about it at all. If you are an ASU student or live near ASU and feeling Thai then I would recommend trying it out.

The service was excellent and fast. I had a very good experience here for my 1st visit. I do anticipate after 1-2 more trips I will be editing this review to 5 stars. 

Zero complaints, much praise."}
{"text":"5 Stars for being what it is - an excellent cheap easy thai restaurant.  This place isn't winning any awards for outside appearance but the food is all I want and I want more of it!"}
{"text":"I love Thai basil! They're service is fast, the servers are great, and the food is always amazing. After my 10 years in the food industry this is one restaurant that impresses me with their quality. My combo- pot stickers for my app and pad see ew for entree"}
{"text":"I was very disappointed with this place.  I called and ordered the spicy fried rice with chicken, and attempted to add an order of wide rice noodles. I should have known the order was going to be wrong when I had to explain the a la carte order three times. Surprise!!!! There seemed to be a bit of a language barrier,  but an employee should be familiar with their menu.  I received a large side of albino egg noodles, plain. The ingredients in the main dish were pretty good, but they were so far and few; literally three pieces of bell pepper.  The description says everything is cooked In a spicy garlic sauce,  so when she asked me what spice level I wanted I said medium. Medium at any other thai restaurant would mean a good heat without burning my fave off.  Apparently here medium means they don't even use any sauce.  Dry rice and tiny pieces of other ingredients is what I received. 

As if that weren't annoying enough,  the girl at the register was rude and wouldn't even make eye contact.  Sorry you hate your job but I never made you work here. Passible food and terrible customer service will keep me from returning."}
{"text":"Tried the Pad Thai, mild spice. The portion was large enough for two meals (for me, at least). It was hotter than I expected which was okay. I ordered it with tofu which was crunchy and dee-lish. I enjoyed the dish immensely."}
{"text":"I like the steamed white rice . I ordered the hot and sour soup, Thai eggplant, and Shanghai egg rolls. They may have been marinating in oil or something. Everything as SUPER GREESY. I thought I order well enough food so that I didn't yack at the gym but I'm certainly not going after attempting to eat that mess. The rice was  though. It's funny but I'd go back and try something else because other people seem to like it."}
{"text":"Two visits in one week (last week)! Big servings, quick and friendly staff, cozy atmosphere. The price is great, too.

If you like coconut dishes, check out the Red Thai Curry with Chicken."}
{"text":"Trying Thai Basil once again, different location but experience not much different from my last. 


I would have to agree with the identity crisis this place seems to be experiencing. Found it to be somewhat creative to be able to mix so much in one small place. Loved the cleanness, minus the sticky table tops. 

Service was average. Our server was pleasant, helpful and was attentive of our needs. 

Food: 
Drunken Noodles- after realizing this place didn't have Pad See Ew, this was the next closest dish. Looked amazing at first but after first forkful, I was done! Extremely starchy, had beef and beef was chewy, almost elastic like. 

Lo Mein Noodles- words cannot describe how terrible this dish was! The worst dish of all dishes I tried. Also starchy, no seasoning whatsoever, we added shrimp and got 4 pieces of shrimp total and those were also bland! Panda Express serves better than this!

Pad Thai- noodles were overlooked to an extreme. Also added shrimp, and shrimp in this dish actually tasted a lot better. Surely not good pad thai.

Chicken Teriyaki-saved the best for last! One dish was enjoyed by the entire table and this was the Chicken Teriyaki. Chicken was flavorful, nicely grilled and simply amazing! No complaints on this. 

Love Thai food and this joint was extremely mediocre in my opinion. Their prices are very reasonable and portions are huge but was not a fan. Scratching off my list and will not be back."}
{"text":"Ordered green thai curry and eggplant/minced pork from the lunch menu today. Both came with a spring roll and soup for appetizer and a side of rice. The portion is just right for lunch, felt full but not exploding by the end of it. 

I liked how both dishes were very flavourful. The green curry was creamy and had a strong coconut flavor but the chicken tasted dry despite the copous amounts of sauce. The eggplant dish was too salty but like I said, the flavor was there and it was not bad.

We also ordered glutinous rice with fresh mango and coconut sauce. I would not reccommend this dessert. The glutinous rice was dry and too hard. It was also warm while the mango was cold. The combination of everything together did not mesh well.

For the price, lunch menu is worth it. The food is not bad. The servers were very cheerful and the decor is well done which made the experience nicer. I wouldn't mind eating here again but it also would not be my first choice."}
{"text":"Thai Basil has been our go-to takeout place for Thai food. They have a variety of dishes to choose from. So far we have tried pineapple fried rice, ginger stir-fry, pad thai, chow mein, spicy eggplant, pad see u among others. The quality of the food is consistently good. There is usually not a lot of grease and the quantity is more than enough for one person.

Food is usually ready in less than 15 minutes and is always fresh and hot. Prices are reasonable. The owner is friendly and is open to feedback. We once had slightly undercooked ginger stir fry and he appreciated the feedback and corrected/refunded the dish for us the next time we ordered from them."}
{"text":"Friendly and helpful staff. Love going here for Asian food that is spot on and always consistent. I had beef teriyaki bento and my husband had chicken teriyaki bento."}
{"text":"This is real Thai Food!  I am literally upset with myself right now for having seen this place for years and never stopping in...  What amazing Thai food and service.  I like spicy food a lot, and I asked them to make is extra spicy.  They did not just add peppers, they actually made it spicier with real ingredient that taste good.  The flavors were all separate and not blended together like many other Thai places I have gone too.  Best i have had!"}
{"text":"Submitted in error"}
{"text":"There are quite a few Thai restaurants to choose from in downtown Tempe, but this is my favorite. They have the best Pad Thai and a fantastic Red Curry. The employees are always super nice and greet me with a smile when I pick up my order."}
{"text":"I love this place!  First restaurant I visited in Downtown Phoenix and I was blown away with the great service!  Their yellow curry is amazing!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch with a friend and shared orders of green curry and pad-see-eiw noodles. Both dishes were very good, but very spicy for a medium-level. I love spicy food, but I don't think I could handle much more heat! Service was fine, but the restaurant wasn't very busy."}
{"text":"Absolutely my favorite Thai restaurant in all of Toronto. I've been to so many different so called 'authentic' Thai restaurants and it doesn't compare to this. I've traveled to Thailand and this restaurant is the most authentic.

All their food is full of flavor. I've tried their curry beef mussamun and their green curry chicken. My favorite dishes there!! For some people green curry might be a little spicy for you but overall the flavor of the basil is not too overpowering but just enough to bring in the flavor of the curry.

Another one I have tried recently is the fish boiled in the soup. It has so much flavor of the lemongrass and the soup is so flavorful that you could simply drink the soup and taste the fish. Goody!!!

Desserts I love there are the mango and coconut rice. And I've also tried the black rice dessert but kind of too sweet for me. Another simple tasty dessert is the deep fried banana with mango ice cream!! Mmmm mango ice cream! 

A recommended Thai restaurant for sure!"}
{"text":"Great service.  However, I didn't think this place had good ambience and the food was eh mediocre.  I had high expectations due to the 4 stars.  I don't have anything terrible to say about this restaurant but there was no wow factor.  I probably won't be back.  It's not even in the same league as Yupha's Kitchen."}
{"text":"I went on a girls day out this last Saturday. We got there around 1, it was pretty dead, so we had the whole place to decide where to sit. It is quite a bit bigger than the University location (that is the only other location I have been to, and partly why this one is getting five stars). We took a few minutes to figure out what we were getting (well not me, I order the same thing every time, I need to venture out a little more, but I just love love love the masaman and Thai fried rice so much). My Sis got the masaman also, she is stuck on it like I am, and our friend got the sweet and sour. The food came out so fast, like five minutes! Of course my Sis and I loved it, we are Thai Basil fanatics. Our friend had never had Thai, but she said she really liked what she ordered. We indulged and got the sticky rice dessert, and I loved it. 

I am going with a five for a few reasons. First, this place impressed me more than the University location, which says a lot in my eyes because I love the University location a lot. The service there has always been amazing. The food was good 'ol Thai Basil, but something about it was just better. The cook must have just been better or something, cause it was just better for some reason. So as far as comparison, this location is great and gets a five! Also, this is coming from my narrow Thai food scope, but it is the best I have had. The only other Thai places I have eatin at are Line Thai and Siam Thai, both are great, but this Thai basil location is awesome!"}
{"text":"The Thai Basil restaurant is decorated with Thai statues and black framed art. Every table has a vase with a green plant and a paper light. For drinks, I'd recommend the Thai Iced Tea, which consisted of thai tea and half and half. Unlike most Thai restaurant, it was a brownish orange color. The Fried Tofu consisted of 6 deep fried, gigantic tofu triangles. It was served with homemade sweet and sour sauce. The Pad See Ew with Beef consisted of stir fried wide rice noodles, egg, sweet soy sauce, chinese broccoli, broccoli, and carrots. The Kao Pad Pineapple with Chicken consisted of fried rice, egg, pineapple chunks, cashew nuts, tomato wedges, carrots, julienne onions, and peas. It wasn't in a tomato based sauce. The Sweet Sticky Rice with Mango consisted of black beans and sticky rice topped with condensed milk and served with sliced whole mango. It was a great way to end the meal!"}
{"text":"This is the greatest Red Curry . The portions are a good size. The sweet rice mango desert is the bomb and a must have is the Thai tea. The service is always amazing."}
{"text":"meh... I had the Pad Thai, which should be a pretty easy dish for a Thai place to make. Ironically I had read a previous reviewer who mentioned that this place had excellent pad thai because it wasn't drowned in sauce... I thought that was peculiar because I had never really had Pad Thai that I would describe as being too saucy... Well it must be an Arizona thing.. and if this place was NOT soupy, I would hate to visit the more saucy pad thai joints. Maybe they just serve it in a bowl with a spoon? :) My Pad thai was drenched in a syrupy sauce that really took away from the taste and texture of the rest of the ingredients. On the plus side, the seafood was cooked well. The prices weren't horrible either. But I wouldn't go back. Obviously the tastes of the students near by has something to do with this places 4 star rating :)"}
{"text":"Food portions were a little small for the price in my own opinion. It wasn't the best thai food I've ever had but it was a good try. The pineapple fried rice was ok, but again the hollow pineapple was such a waste.  It made the rice portion smaller. Never that busy that you can't get a seat. Overall experience was ok."}
{"text":"The boys and I were out and about and as normal craving some Thai, we drove by Thai Basil and decided to give them a try.

It was a Sunday night around 6pm and the place was steady not too busy, we were seated right away. Right off the bat we all ordered Thai Tea, we know what we like. The Thai Tea comes in some tall glasses and I just  love the contrasting colors of the tea & cream till I swirl it and blend it all up! This Thai tea was delish too!

We went with the crab puffs as starters; they were simple and good for starters.

For my main dish I went with the massaman curry, Thai hot!  it was chicken bathed in massaman  curry with coconut milk, carrots, onions peanuts & potatoes and hit with some heat! It also is served with steamed jasmine rice.  This dish was delish! It was creamy, hot and full of flavor! 

Service was great and friendly glad to have stopped by and given Thai Basil a try."}
{"text":"I have not been there for awhile, just had lunch there today and I was disappointed.  It was hot, noisy, and the flavor of the food has gone down.  What a bummer!  I got the lunch special BBQ Pork, with fried rice, and a thai ice tea.  Got the veggie soup, it was salty and very peppery.  Ok, moving on to the lunch plate it was the same as before but the taste of the sauces is watered down or something,  It was just not as flavorful as I remember!  The egg roll was meh, diffent than the thai egg rolls I have had before at other places.  The Thai Ice tea was the only thing that had good and strong flavor.  

Maybe it was a miss today?"}
{"text":"This place is great for lunch. They have a lot of scent lotion. From make your own noodle soup to the lunch specials on the menu. Their ties he is always really good. I always like the pad thai, make your own noodles Bowl, and grilled pork.  The service is quick and friendly. And there's also an option you can sit outside when the weather permits"}
{"text":"This place was recommended by my close friend, so I decided to give it a try. The place opens at 11:30am amd we got there quarter after 12pm. Tables were about 1/3 full. As you walk in, you will be greeted by the courteous hostess with a smile, which is a big plus. Loved nice cozy wooden decor. Our server knew what he was doing. They were friendly and very attentive. I asked any recommendations. So we ordered lunch chicken pad thai($8.95), green curry chicken($8.95) and \"mussamun\" curry beef brisket($9.95). 

Pad thai was decent. It was little dry but quality and quantity both were good. Ask extra peanuts. Sooooo good.

Green curry was pretty good. Eggplant was a very good combination. Just a right amount of heat.

\"mussamun\" beef brisket was da bomb. No description needed. Sooo good! Just so good. 

Only minus would be port of curry was little too small and pad thai was too much. Hope they have a nicer plates. 

I'll definitely come back."}
{"text":"having eaten at a fair share of thai restaurants, this was one of the nicest thai restaurants i have been at- the decor is quite impressive, restrooms were clean! 

the food was great- no complaints, very reasonable prices as well- definitely worth every penny! 

reasons for not giving it 5 stars: noise level- on the loud side, due to the size of the restaurant (on the smallish side), because of that it was also a little cramped inside. but don't let these factors defer you from trying this place out!"}
{"text":"If a friend tells you to not go here, unfriend them...they are stupid. This is a great place that is pretty much no frills Thai food. Their selection is great. Portions are huge. They can make the food HOT too which is pretty nice to see. Also, they serve the food fast which is really nice during the lunch rush. The only thing that kind of stinks is the parking lot size. It's pretty small and tight but if you are creative, there is always a spot for you. Maybe park a block away and just walk as it is worth it."}
{"text":"The atmosphere and decoration is very unqiue and nice. We ordered a tom yum noodle soup and a chicken pad thai. The noodle soup was great, tasted a little sour with a kick of spicy in it, not too spicy but just enough to make it last on your taste buds. The pad thai was also good, the sweet and sour balanced well and noodles were not over cooked. I would recommend my friends and family coming here to eat and I will come again."}
{"text":"Wow!!!  Stopped in for lunch and ordered a number of vegan dishes. Honestly the flavours were amazing and everything was prepared 10/10. Place is exceptionally clean and the staff are super friendly."}
{"text":"The Tom Kha coconut soup is amazing to go. I also ordered the pot stickers and spring rolls as an appetizer. Neither were good. They were both over cooked and hard and had little taste or filling. The sauce that comes with it is amazing though. The green chai tea hot is so good!!"}
{"text":"I'm ordering from Thai Basil once or twice a week.  Thus far, I've tried a few different curries so far and a few of the appetizers.  I enjoy the fried tofu and crab rangoons.  I recently ordered the pot stickers.  Good flavor but I found them a bit too chewy for my taste.  The curries are pretty good.  I like my curries spicy and they don't disappoint.

This is intended to be a take-out restaurant, though they have 3 tables in the storefront.  Good food, quick turnaround, friendly service."}
{"text":"I have a like/hate relationship with Thai Basil.  My gourmand of a self thinks that on many levels, it's the penultimate example of the gentrification of world cuisine - as if Arizonans couldn't handle the dishes as they'd been prepared in Thailand, every dish was constructed with a pre-picked starch, meat and sauce, same vegetables in every single friggin' dish.  Thai Basil Beef? Cabbage, broccoli, carrots, zuchini, red peppers and bamboo shoots.  Fried Rice? Rice, cabbage, broccoli, carrots, zuchini, red peppers and bamboo shoots.  Spicy Noodles with Shrimp? Rice noodles, shrimp, cabbage, broccoli, carrots, zuchini, red peppers and bamboo shoots.  It's kind of insulting in a way - it's like \"Give us some credit and make the food the way you'd make it for yourself! Not the Thai version of Panda Express\"

And yet, I go to Thai Basil.  All the time.  When I'm jonesing for stir fry or a mess of rice, it's cheap and plentiful.  And it tastes really good.  Aside from the curries, which are shockingly bland, the rice and noodle dishes are all insanely edible.  It makes me feel guilty for being a hater and demanding that my Thai food taste like Thai food.  In the words of Jamiroquai, \"if I like it, I do it...\"

I guess this will continue to be my drunken hookup of a restaurant.  I don't want to make my love public, but I'm all up in it like the rest of the crowd.

Ok, I'll put my haterade down now ;)"}
{"text":"The food is delicious, the service is terrible. The night I came was not that busy, but my table was treated like the table no one wanted to service. We had six guests, a good money making table for them, but I had to approach the server twice to get our drinks in. Once the orders were in, the orders all came out pretty messed up. My noodles were good, delicious, even, but the service turned me off. Especially since the same issues occurred at the Scottsdale location.

Plus, the bills come with just a total, no itemization. The server handed me one, then handed me a larger bill and said she mistakenly gave me the wrong one. How was I to know she gave me the right bill that time?"}
{"text":"My 2nd favorite Thai place. Service is super fast and the salads have a delicious peanut dressing..  I had the bbq chicken and the chicken was grilled with two decent size pieces of chicken rice and bbq dipping sauce.  I also ordered the limeade.  Absolutely the best I've had.  Unexpected happy surprise.  Eager to go back."}
{"text":"You know, the best thing about thai cuisine is how colourful it is. Came wtb ftb on this shiner of a day. The green curry is hotter than ex girlfriend."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Thai Basil.  Wow!  I loved it, and will certainly be going back.  I don't live in Phoenix, or I'd be there every week.  I ordered the special (Curry with Roasted Duck).  I got it with the red curry.  The veggies in the dish all seemed fresh (as opposed to frozen).  It was a huge portion!  Just talking about it is making me want to eat it again!  Go here!"}
{"text":"Everything was perfect! Potstickers were awesome, green curry was awesome, portions were huge and the waitress was great! Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Been there twice for lunch.  Very yummy bento box and good Chinese/Thai decoration..."}
{"text":"If you're looking for Thai food that has lots of flavor this is not the place! 


Worst Thai food I have ever had. Months ago I tried the ginger stir fry in which there was only meat, broccoli and bamboo shoots. Totally disappointed. Then today I decided to give them another try, because hey! It could have only been the stir fry but boy was I wrong. I got the Pad Thai and it's the worst I have ever eaten in my life l, I'm not fibbing."}
{"text":"You know i was going to give them 2 stars at the very very beginning...Honestly i was. Why only 2 stars you are most likely wondering.  To start off to give you a little idea is that i was born and raised in the bay area for almost 22 years of my life on nothing but the most amazing Asian spots to eat at with the best flavor and all. 
     Luckily i did find a Thai spot out here in hot dry Arizona which does not happen to be Thai basil obviously.  Second off i happen to be a huge foodie and let flavors sit to get the full experience. Thai basil lacks A LOT of flavor because everything was so watered down. 
      I asked for mild panang curry and my friend ordered the mild pad thai.  i was expecting some sort of spiciness given the fact that i had asked for MILD and not  MEDIUM. I shouldn't have to order the hot to get more flavor out of it wouldn't you agree?? something in between spicy and no spice? it would make sense...but thai basil failed that miserably on the flavor aspect and spiciness lots of points missed there. 
     Now we had got there 5 min after the lunch hour meal deal had ended but we did not want huge dinner portions at the time so we had asked very politely if it was possible if we could order the lunch meal instead. The manager, I'm assuming agreed and brought us out some soup to start. The soup was not bad since we were starving at the moment and i love tofu so okay onward with my review.  Shortly after they had brought out my awaited panang curry which looked to be quite soupy and full of veggies which i do not mind. What matters the most is the consistency and flavor. Which you should have an idea of how the flavor turned out but it gets worse. As i poured some curry over my rice and go to eat a spoonful i am quite used to a spoonful of curry to cover the rice with enough flavor.  This was not the case here. i had to basically pour a whole bowl of curry onto a small tiny cup of rice to get any flavor of curry over my rice. :(
       Thai basil had screwed up my friends pad thai and brought out her piping hot plate a couple minutes later hers was not even tinted with any redness we should not need to add more hot sauce when  we asked for mild we expected mild. We were more than happy to get the lunch special than a huge dinner plate because of the fact  that we should not have to pay so much for HORRID(cleaned up word for what i would like to say) food. We were definitely complaining but don't you think  you would also if you were to see a rating of 4 stars out of five on a highly reviewed Thai place?  My other friends pad see ewe? was lacking of all flavor apparently in 85% of the dish and said the rest was bland.
        The employees were giving us the dirty eye the rest of the time when they realized how much we hated their food. When they brought us to go boxes we didn't need i just told my friends it was pointless to pack the nastiness up when we really wouldn't be eating it later. They agreed and asked for to go cups for our thai tea instead the employee came back and slammed the cups down and walked away continuing to give us dirty looks. TERRIFIC. So freaking what if we dont like your disgusting food. Everyone has a right to their own opinion. and this was 3 reviews in one. 

        We did NOT leave a tip because the employees were not helpful or considerate since we did not enjoy their food in the slightest. it was not worth my 10 dollars because i ended up having the worst stomach pain for 12 hours straight and bubble guts for probably a good 7-8 hours in the beginning. gross, i know.  I would like to give them another chance but after my 12 hour long incident i really don't want to risk it. I will continue to go to my beloved thai rama when they are open that has to suffice until i go back to the real deal in San Francisco, Milpitas, San Jose or Tracy, CA."}
{"text":"Yum Yum!
I love that they actually use spices to heat the flavors up & they ask your spice level.
So GOOD!"}
{"text":"Dropped by for lunch after school - went with the usual- shrimp medium spiced red curry. They brought it out with a veggie roll and soup. 

Food came out quick and service was fine. 

The shrimps were good/large and the portion was filling. Very good meal."}
{"text":"I ordered a Chow Mein and it had 3 tiny pieces of broccoli and like 2 slices of carrot. It's basically JUST noodles. Nice service but the dish lacks severely. Not coming again :("}
{"text":"Food is amazing! The decor is very nice and the staff is very friendly. Love this place!"}
{"text":"I was looking for a Thai place close to me and was pleasantly surprised that Thai Basil is literally within walking distance. I ordered the pad Thai and spring rolls to go. The sauce they give you for your salad is so good (comes with the spring rolls.) I loved everything. The pad Thai could have used a little more sauce but overall this place is fantastic. Won't be my last time here."}
{"text":"This place is very nice! Tastes great, good seating, lovely staff, and the decor is beautiful! Very delicious. It's definitely one of the top Thai restaurants in Markham and worth the drive for those of us who don't live quite that close.

Start off with some tomyum soup or try the coconut chicken soup. A touch spicy but great way to start your meal.

We enjoyed the pad Thai very much here. Usually, pad Thai is very mushy and sticky, but here it's well made, doesn't clump together and tastes great! I also enjoy the massumum Curry beef. Very sweet and nutty 

Something really unique was their steamed Thai mullet. It's a whole fish cooked in broth with a delicious array of vegetables and a spicy, refreshing sauce. :) 

 Finish off with their sticky rice desserts. Comes with fresh mango pieces and a yummy coconut sauce."}
{"text":"One of our favorites! Always consistent and everything we have had is great! Some family favorites are: seasame chicken, Mongolian beef, and chicken pad Thai."}
{"text":"Found a new location of one of my favorite Thai places, this time right around the corner from the technical training class I was taking to brush up on my Cisco networking.

I had the lunch Spicy Noodles with chicken and it was just as good as anything I've had at the Tempe location. The service was attentive at first but kind of fell off after I got my food. 

I will definitely be back for more when I go back for more training!"}
{"text":"Yummmmm... Pad Thai!  You can smell that this food will be good before you even enter the restaurant.  We took our order to go and it was all I could do to not rip the bag open and start eating in the car!  We ordered the chicken skewers with a rich, thick yummy peanut sauce and pot stickers.  The Pad Tahi had a lot of green onion and big chunks of chicken in it.  Great food.  Order it to go and hop on over for a beer next door.  They'll bring it over to you!"}
{"text":"Okay, so I know 5 stars is being a bit enthusiastic, but when you have the best thai of your life, you just gotta shout it to the world.

I went here with my brother in December after hearing rave reviews from him for years. When I saw the special sign outside say \"pumpkin curry\", I knew my life would never be the same *cue lovey dovey music here*

Place was small, but cozy and nicely decorated. Waiting staff was very attentive, and probably eyed me for drinking so much water haha. 

So back to the curry. Normally I'm not the biggest fan of thai curries and prefer an indian curry mostly, but this was perfectly sweet and savory. Everything about it was perfect, I kid you not! Salad, rice, chicken curry. Beautiful. 

And now I'm back in Michigan. le sigh.

So go here and experience the greatness. Prices are not bad, parking is plentiful, and a good place to bring a date, or a sister, as it turns out :)"}
{"text":"Great Thai! Last visit I ordered the green curry and will again. It's a bit overly cozy for romantic date night but the perfect place for lunch with my daughter."}
{"text":"This. Place. Is. Great. Been going here ever since I spent a month in Thailand in 2008. When I came back I had super crazy cravings for Thai atmosphere and food... Thai basil delivers. Khob khun krap."}
{"text":"We ordered tom kha soup level 4 spicy, but they gave us mild, so the soup was too sweet. This is the 4th time this has happened. We also ordered the red curry and there was so much water in it that it was thinner than the soup--not exaggerating. Because of all the water, it also did not have any flavor. We literally couldn't eat it. Total waste of money and the last time we'll be ordering from thai basil."}
{"text":"I like most things on their menu, but Lunch specials are heavily recommended. The service can be hit or miss and sometimes the noodles are greasy. But usually, going here means a good time."}
{"text":"I know there are some people who will argue, but for me, this Thai basil is as good as it gets for Thai food in the valley.  The trick however, is that it must be this specific Thai basil.  When I moved out of Tempe I tried the Thai basil downtown and eventually every other location they have and none compare to this one.  Their curries have more flavor, they give you more rice, and the people there are extremely nice.  

This place was a staple for me while I was in college, and whether I was coming in alone for a quick lunch, ordering pick up for dinner, or coming in with friends, I have never had a bad experience at this place.  

Their green curry is my favorite dish and they have a good range of spice to satisfy whatever mood I'm in, or whatever wimp I'm with who can't handle the heat.  

In addition to their main courses, they have excellent complimentary miso soup at lunch time, and tasty spring rolls on the side of every dish.  

I usually can't pack in dessert after polishing by heart portion of curry, but if you are feeling indulgent while you're there, try the F.B.I. (Fried Banana Ice Cream).  Its a great dessert that's delicious, but not overly sweet on the tongue. 

I highly suggest you try this place out, it is a guaranteed great meal, but do not think you can stop at any Thai Basil instead, they are not carbon copies like most restaurant chains."}
{"text":"We ordered takeout from here several times now and they are very consistent with the quality. You know what you are getting. We usually get the pad thai, brisket, and chicken rice. We've also had the mango salad which is very nice. The mangos were a little too hard, though so we didn't get it again. I prefer them a bit riper.Overall, I really enjoy the flavours of Thai cuisine and although some dishes are very spicy, I don't mind that. The portions are a good size for sharing in a group and the delivery is fast. A great place to grab a quick bite once in a while."}
{"text":"Been here once before. Came to pick up lunch around 215 and they close at 3. For the last 45 minutes that the restaurant was opened they ignored their phones. Finally we drove by around 240 and they had the open signs off and still answered no calls. The food is decent but this having happened more than once was unacceptable...the customer service dictated this review."}
{"text":"Was in Phoenix for business for 3 loooong weeks. Saw this place after I ate at some other place in Tempe....Looked crowded and checked it out on Yelp.

Pretty good Thai food, Pad thai is yummy (imo) however the curry was kinda watery.  It didn't taste like it had coconut milk in it....That's just me though. I've made Thai curry (or at least my hubby has) and it had a much thicker consistency with a stronger coconut flavor.  

Other dishes are good and they are reasonably priced. If I ever have to go Phoenix again for business (and I hope not) I will stop by this place.  

One other thing, usually Thai places have a spice rack, this one didn't have one. I'm used to have a vinegar mixture of garlic and thai peppers, some hot chili flakes, some soy sauce with ginger and green onions and jalepenos."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Thai restaurant!  The staff is always frindly and courteous.  The Pad Thai Chicken is the best I ever had.  Always hot and fresh, cooked to your spice-level, and served quickly which is important for the lunch hour."}
{"text":"Delicious!! We're visiting the area from L.A. we found it driving around. We're definitely coming back tomorrow. I ordered The spicy noodles. It was delicious . Service is great and fast"}
{"text":"This is one of the worst restaurants I've ever tried to order from.  They take 2 hours to get you delivery, they always screw up the my order and they have no clue how to give good service.  Every time I've worked with them, they've screwed something up and they've never tried to make it right.  If Madison had any other food options, I would never order from them again."}
{"text":"First let me say this, this food was amazing!

Went to dinner with a group of friends from nearby Landmark Education.  I had never been here before but I was looking forward to it.

The restaurant was clean and inviting...  First impressions were definitely a good start.  The server indicated we could sit where we wanted and quickly brought out sparkling clean glasses of water with fresh lime slices in them.  First time I have had lime in my water glass and it was a refreshing change.,

I ordered the Papaya salad.  \"A North Eastern Thai style salad, fresh green papaya tossed with grilled prawns, carrots, tomatoes, peanuts, green beans and spicy lime juice.\" 

I have never had green papaya, and was intrigued,.. The order came out within 10 minutes.  Beautiful plump looking prawns sat atop a mound of shredded green papaya.  The salad was garnished with a lovely carrot rose.

The salad was absolutely delicious.  The spicy lime juice was not too spicy, indeed, I hardly noticed any spice at all.  Just a tinge of sweetness made it a perfect accompaniement to the prawns and the green papaya.  The salad was fresh, sweet, and beautifully prepared.  I really enjoyed it.

My dinner partners also enjoyed their meals from Thai Basil, to Pad Thai, everything came out fresh and deliciousliy prepared.

Highly recommend, can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I have been here few times already but the last time I was here was like a year ago. We came back this time is because my sister want to eat Thai food and this place was good; but this time is not. We ordered the pineapple fried rice and there's no taste! Just taste like plain white rice. We also order the tong yum gong soup and it was warm; like they putted out for a long time and didn't even reheat it. We also ordered a dish of vegetable and no taste. Basically all the dishes was no taste. Don't know if they changed the chef. Before it was good, and now.......

I hope it was just that day. I might go again since maybe they will change the chef again."}
{"text":"The absolute best Thai food around Tempe and possibly Phoenix. Convenient location right next to Tempe ASU campus."}
{"text":"Thai Basil is probably one of the better Thai restaurants in Phoenix; however, it just OK to me. Most of the dishes I've had are somewhat flavorful, but I feel like they all leave me feeling like they are a little bland. In addition, vegetables are often undercooked, especially the potatoes in yellow curry. The meats are of decent quality, but are a little bit dry and tough. The spiciness is inconsistent--I usually order things \"hot,\" but the dishes will still range from only mildly spicy to sweating/burning hot."}
{"text":"The service is fast, servers remember you and food always tastes great. Love their green curry chicken lunch special! (It comes with a slice of watermelon... never seen this before at a Thai place, but it's delish!)"}
{"text":"While the food here is very good, the service leaves much to be desired.  Visited solo on a Friday night at 7ish during a business trip.  It was moderately busy with ample empty tables. Hostess sat me in a rush at a 2-top with no niceties or eye contact. After a very long wait for a drink, a young fellow, presumably a family member of Asian origin, came over to take the full order all at once - would have enjoyed a beer first but whatever. Quickly took the order with zero hospitality and rushed off before I could ask for brown rice rather than white, or another beer. The food was delivered with a quick drop-down and rush-off - no attempt to see if I needed any side condiments or another beer.  No one ever came over to see if I needed anything or liked the food spiciness. I had to flag the boy down to get my second beer.  Having said all that, I had the Thai Basil signature dish, which was quite good with bright veggies and not over cooked.  I would have enjoyed it more with brown rice and a side of chili paste, but never got the chance to request it. The bill was delivered with no thank you, and again I had to flag them down to take the credit card.  While the food was 4-star, the negligent unwelcoming service is at best 2-star.  I noticed another server being quite friendly with her customers so perhaps it's just mom and son who need customer service training - badly.  Sorry to be harsh, but you've got to be much friendlier and hospitable if you want your customer to enjoy the experience of dining here, not just the food."}
{"text":"Great food. Love their Soups, apps are great. Really good pad thai. Delivery is consistant. Their driver is particularly rude. Comical almost."}
{"text":"The happy hour is very satisfying and service was great. The only upsetting part is every chair seemed to have armrests except for mine."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! I always get the Green Curry, just vegetables -HOT! The Red Curry is always great. They both have FRESH large pieces of carrots, mushrooms, etc. SO GOOD! It comes with a side of white rice. Hot or Cold, if you get it to go it will last for dinner and breakfast the next day. Just make sure you don't get the lunch size.

The place is small but plenty of seating, the decor is nice and the service is good."}
{"text":"Ordered take out yesterday for a girlfriend and I, it was delivered before the suggested time which is always good. 

Ordered the shrimp pad thai, chicken pad thai and the tum yum soup. All delicious and full of flavour however, the seafood tum yum (what's written on the menu) soup only consists of shrimp and mushroom, for 6.95 please put more than TWO shrimps and 4 pieces of MUSHROOM in a large cup full of broth. I will ordered take out again just not the soup."}
{"text":"My sister introduced me to Thai Basil couple years back and this has been my go-to spot for some Thai flava.  I am giving this place five stars because the food is good to me and throughout my years with Thai Basil- it has never failed- dishes are quite consistent. 

Cute little restaurant in Bicycle Plaza, clean, service is ok- pretty good for an Asian restaurant. :)

I love the Spicy Noodles with chicken, papaya salad is what I always order, tom yum soup (need more seafood ;), the lunch plates are delicious and you get a little bowl of soup before your meal.  

I've been to other Thai restaurants but Thai Basil is the one for me. 

I highly recommend Thai Basil to first timers as well...if you have never had Thai food- try out Thai Basil- you'll love it...if not like.  I promise!"}
{"text":"I'm glad I discovered this place.  In the past couple weeks I've tried the ginger, pad thai, tom kah, and tom yum (all with tofu).  Each was delicious, except that I would have preferred that the pad thai be made with more peanut sauce.  Their menu offers peanut sauce on the side for $1.00, and I'd suggest getting extra if you enjoy the peanut flavor of pad thai.

I'm looking forward to trying many other dishes -- I love thai food."}
{"text":"I ordered food from here the other day. I was so excited to have my long waited for Chicken Red Curry. Unfortunately, not only was it the wrong size, it was not \"Thai Spicy\" as I requested, and it was missing the red in the sauce- looked like pure white curry. When I called to discuss this with the manager I was put on hold for 14 minutes and then hung up on.  When I called back no one answered. I will never go to this restaurant and I DO NOT recommend it!"}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times. Their green curry is awesome and a must try!"}
{"text":"Yet another entry into the Thai Basil family...so far...better than the others I have tried.

Sunday Afternoon, 3 PM and in the search for Thai, everything is closed between lunch and dinner.  

The luck of a good eye catching the name of the restaurant drew me in.  It appears to be the stripmall version...not a lot of ambience, about 50 seats, Only 1 other table seated when I entered the establishment.  

Host/waitperson is sitting behind the pay out counter, and as she stands, she waves me in.  Picking up a menu, she meets me at the table, opens my menu and invites me to sit.  She turned to get water.  Seated, I checked the menu and when she returned, I let her know I was ready to order.  

Steamed Rice and Som Tom, which is shredded green papaya salad.  The salad is papaya, palm sugar, tomato, garlic, lime juice and fish sauce.  Some places add green bean, shrimp or salt crab.  I just want the basic.  Some thai restaurants understand the idea of Thai hot, though the waitperson had to ask for clarity.  Thai hot is, to me, more spice than is fit for human consumption.

8 minutes from order to delivery.  Salad portion is respectable, about 1 1/2 cups.  It is served on cut lettuce with some shredded purple cabbage.  While I ordered Thai Hot, I received a preparation that was 5 hot (5 makes my nose run, 8 makes my forehead sweat and 10/Thai Hot brings tears to my eyes).  The chef came out and asked my impression of the salad.  I advised it was tasty, a bit salty and not as hot as I would have liked.  

She said she would remember next time.

Rice...1 1/4 cup, a little mushy.

Certainly a better experience as compared to the Thai Basil locations close to ASU.  The location is clean...nearly looks barren in this Sunday afternoon light.  I will be back to try other items."}
{"text":"A renovation...looks to be different kitchen and wait staff as well...tho the wait staff is needing a little contact with regard to acceptable and appropriate daytime restaurant service attire.

There has been a renovation...and the space has certainly been improved.  With about 60 seats in the room, the colors and varying heights/spacing of the tables  of dining areas make for what feels like privacy.  On arriving 11:30 AM on a Thursday, I was gratified to see about 40 people in the restaurant.  With no sign about seating self or waiting, I caught the eye of one of the waitress' and she directed me to a seat not far from the kitchen/main service area.  

I sat and received both water and menu.  Double-sided, but only lunch menu...no indication of the salad I wanted.  From previous experience as well as menu of other Thai Basil around the Valley, I know the staff has the ingredients and knows how to make my papaya salad...Som Tom.

If you have seen any previous review, you know that Som Tom is julienned green papaya prepared with thai chili, fish sauce, garlic, fresh-squeezed lime juice, tomato and palm sugar.  The salad is frequently offered with green beans, shrimp or salt crab.  It may also have julienned carrot in small portion.  

When the questionably attired waitress came to take my order, I requested Som Tom and steamed rice...ordered Thai hot, no green bean and no shrimp.  She wrote down my order and turned to tender my order.  On to the phone, checking email and news, occupying my time until lunch arrived.

The salad and rice were presented to me in about 10 minutes.  What appeared to be a very large portion of papaya salad, about 3 cups, was an illusion.  The salad was placed on top of a pretty large amount of lettuce, which I did not see until I had taken a few bites of the salad.  I figure I actually had about 1 1/4 cups of papaya salad.

Spice was 5 (makes my nose run, while 8 makes my forehead sweat and 10 brings tears to my eyes).

Rice...a pricy portion, 1 cup, fresh and well presented.  Just kinda hurts to have to pay for rice that is a traditional accompaniment.

No windows on the west side means comfort for afternoon and early evening enjoyment...

With regard to  the questionably attired waitress, what is going on with the denim shorts not fastened in front, hanging off the backside...netting and a t-shirt that does not meet the waist of the denim shorts...it leads me to wonder about the cleanliness of the presentation."}
{"text":"As a Tempe retread (my initials are still scratched into several corners on Rural from pavement being poured in 1989 and 90), I am rediscovering a few old favorite places and trying many new opportunities.  Last night, Thai Basil had both star earning and star losing moments.

The \"Gotta have THAI\" monkey popped up on my back early yesterday.  As the love of my life is out of town for a few days and does not have the same passion for Thai that I do, the monkey's timing was good.  Since we are now within Orbit range, I went to my trusty Yelp mobile app and  told it to Thai me.  Thai Basil struck and away I went.

On arriving at 6 PM, there were 5 cars in the lot and on entering, about 20 folks seated at tables enjoying.  The restaurant appears to be clean, though the lighting is dim.  There is apparently a second seating area that I did not explore, so don't hold me to the customer count.  I stood at the door for a moment (in TV terms, a moment is 1 1/2 minutes) and was greeted and seated.  The host handed me a menu and walked away.  I perused the menu for a minute, closed it and started waiting.

5 minutes passed, and I caught the eye of a server who brought appetizers to a table near mine.  She came over and I asked if I could place my order.  She nodded and walked behind the bar, tapped what turned out to be my waiter on the shoulder and pointed at me.  My waiter turned and waved, then walked into the kitchen.  5 minutes later, he came out with his pad and pen.  I ordered Som Tom, the yardstick by which I measure every Thai restaurant, and jasmine rice.  I requested that the green beans and shrimp be left off.  At the menu's suggestion, I ordered Thai Hot.  He wrote down the order and walked away.

I was surprised that there was no request for a beverage order.  I caught the eye of the server again.  She came over and I asked if I could get a glass of water.  She nodded and walked behind the bar, tapped my waiter on the shoulder and let him know about my desire for water.  He turned and waved, then walked into the kitchen.  5 minutes later, he came out with my Som Tom, rice and a glass of water.  He asked if I needed anything else, and when I responded no, he walked away.

Som Tom, properly made, should have lime, chile, palm sugar and fish sauce each of which brings tangy, sweet, salty and spicy notes with the crunch of fresh papaya.  While the portion size was respectable, 2 cups of salad, the seasoning was totally off.  There was no fish sauce or lime that I could detect.  The spice came in at a solid 9 (5 makes my nose run, 8 makes my forehead sweat and 10 brings tears to my eyes), but without all the notes, this was a bad karaoke version of what should be a great song.

I put my fork down and caught my waiter's eye.  He waved, then walked into the kitchen.  5 minutes later, he came to the table and asked if everything was satisfactory.  When I replied to the negative, he said he was sorry and walked into the kitchen.  A moment later, a lady came to the table and asked about my dissatisfaction.  I asked about missing ingredients in the salad.  She grabbed a fork and tasted, then she said it was very sweet.  She offered to have the order remade.  I agreed, and she took the salad to the kitchen, yelling in Thai that it was not right.

I nibbled on rice and sipped water while the order was remade.  The rice was OK, not too sticky and not too dry.  On the second presentation, the lady (who I found out is the manager) asked me to taste this version.  I tasted, and it was a saltier version of the original.  I could get the sweet, the fish sauce and the spice, but no lime.  I asked if I could get some wedges of lime and she said she would take the order back and have it remade.  By this point, it had been nearly an hour since I had arrived, so I asked for the order to go. 

I finished the rice and water while I waited.  Instead of bringing the new order out to the table, the manager waved me over to the bar with a go box.  She had me taste and again, it was below par.  I asked for some lime on the side, only to discover it was juice out of a bottle.

I paid my check and proceeded home.  For the price, $8.95, the time and the multiple attempts, this Thai Basil is not worth the effort.  The contrasts between Thai Basil on University and Thai Basil on Rural are kind of strange.  As I have been made aware, there are 5 Thai Basil operations around the Valley...and being an adventurous sort, I will probably try them all."}
{"text":"This is actually my friend's favourite Thai restaurant so she brought me here.  Before I came I thought it was average, but maybe it's cause of the different food we ordered.  My friend ordered a steam fish, coconut curry, tom yum soup.  It was good! tom yum soup was a little too spicy for me but very flavourful and is my friend's favourite.  Overall the food is very flavourful and the environment is nice."}
{"text":"This is one of the best places I've found in North Las Vegas to eat at.  I work at a local high school and whenever we have staff days, etc..  Honestly-the quality of our food choices (restaurant-wise) are pretty poor in the area.  This is definitely the best Asian food I've found in this area, and they have GREAT lunch specials.  A group of five of us went for lunch, and all of us were very pleased with what we ordered.  Four of us had the bento lunch (7.95!), which includes 4 pieces of sushi (from a choice of a California Roll or a Spicy Tuna Roll), 2 crab wontons, vegetable tempura, a meat dish, edamame and a scoop of rice.  Wow!  It's very cute inside, and service was good.  It's not a WOW restaurant, but it's a great deal in this location.  Definitely give it a try!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch. Prices are fair on the lunch combos which comes with a spring roll and soup but portions on the mains are on the stingy side. Food was great, very authentic Thai taste. But not sure if it was just our table or if it was happening to others as well - the place seemed to be infested with small flies. I usually just swat them away subconsciously and don't mind much of them, but I found myself to be doing more swatting than eating while I was seated. And it's -5 degrees outside! If this is happening in the dining area, I don't know how I'd react if I were to see the room where my food was prepared."}
{"text":"There are many Thai options in this area. Tonight we went to Thai Basil on university. I gave it 3 stars because it is kind of small and they were a little slow for not being very busy. There was only two waitresses, maybe that's why. Our waitress was very sweet. Unfortunately my food was a little cold by the time I got it. 

We ordered Chicken Pad Thai and Tofu Pad Thai. Both were very yummy despite to temperature. The portion size was nice-perfect amount of leftovers and a pretty good price. Just under $10. 

For dessert we got mango on sweet rice with coconut drizzle. The dessert was amazing! Highly recommended

Their Thai tea is delicious! They don't give free refills on lemonade. 

The location is really nice. Right in the heart of Tempe. However, if you are going with more than a couple people, maybe try a different spot."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Thai restaurants in Tempe. I love- you guessed it- the Thai Basil! :)"}
{"text":"Our favourite is the \"Mussamun\" curry beef brisket. 
Thai red curry chicken is also one of our regular orders. 

The Pad Thai is not so good, but their other dishes and nice environment make up for this."}
{"text":"Excellent Thai food.  Nice folks.  Quick delivery.  They also make custom dish just for me . The dining room is beautiful, clean, and nicely laid out.  Oh, happy hour Sushi deal as well."}
{"text":"If I could give this place 0 stars I would. Came here once before for dinner amazing! So decided to have lunch ordering over the phone was a hassle. I got here and told them 15 minutes later they ask me if this was my order... um yes. So I ask to see if it is warm NOPE COLD. So I tell them no it's cold I don't want it. They bring it back to me 5 min later MICROWAVED!!!!! I'm talking salad and everything steaming hot smh. I'm done this is gross I told them no I don't want it they tried to make me pay for it before I saw the food. If you order Togo make sure you check your food smh never again"}
{"text":"I have eaten at this place multiple times and every time I've eaten here have had nothing but the best service and amazing food. Their willingness to serve, and ability to customize makes them truly unique. great atmosphere."}

Thai Basil
Tempe, AZ
1111 S Rural Rd, Tempe, AZ 85281 ~ 1.4 Miles
(480) 557-0101

I genuinely love Thai Basil, back in 2013 I started my freshman year at Arizona State University. Back in those days, I didn't have my own car so it left my food options very limited. My residence hall at that time was located right next door to Thai Basil. I remember thinking at first that the outside of the building looked old, sketchy, and somewhat rundown. I admit, I was being a snob and flat out refused to try it just based on its outer appearance. However, one day I got the BIGGEST hankering for Asian food and Thai Basil was the only thing within walking distance. I was so sick of eating mess hall food and frozen dinners, so I caved and walked in one day. 
I could not have been more wrong about my previous misconceptions of the place. Upon walking in you are immediately greeted by their extremely professional and friendly staff. The restaurant is extremely clean, the food smells amazing, and the ambience they have created on the inside with their decorations makes you feel like you are actually in Thailand dining in a fancy restaurant. I remember being completely blown away by this, the exterior of the building looks old but the interior is amazing and cozy. The food itself is by far some of the best food I have ever consumed, I have tried multiple dishes there and I have always really enjoyed what I've ordered. I have never ever had a bad meal there; their yellow Thai curry is to die for!
I have been to multiple other Thai Basil locations over the years and this one remains my favorite. 
This location has the freshest food, the nicest atmosphere, and by far the friendliest and most helpful staff. The owners in particular really make you feel at home here and they are by far the nicest people I have ever met. Their store is well run, efficient, and they make sure that their staff also treats the customers as family while in the store. This attitude is something specific to this store because the other stores I've been to don't have staff that is as friendly or efficient as the team here. Another thing I really enjoy about this business is how affordable it is, being a poor college student at the time I loved eating here on the regular because of how affordable it is. They also give you extremely large portions of food so you get your money's worth. 
Depending on what you order, you can expect a nice hearty entrée, mixed vegetables, and a bowl of rice. All of this costs around $10.00 and given how big the portions are here you can usually take home leftovers and get another meal out of it. I cannot stress enough how amazing this place is, if you haven't tried it or are afraid to give it a shot don't be. Thai Basil is by far one of my favorite places to dine at to this day."}
{"text":"In the past, I avoided this place because it is located in a strip mall.  So how good can it be?  I should have listened to my mom when she told me not to judge a book by its cover.  

I've now been here three times with coworkers and each time the food has been tasty and hot (temperature). The staff are friendly and even though it's a small place, we've never had a problem getting a table.  They use the space well.  

The lunch portions are just the right size:  large enough to fill you up, but not so large that you need a nap afterwards."}
{"text":"My mom & I stopped in here for a quick lunch on our way out of town.  The place itself is tiny & crowded into a small strip center.  Parking was pretty tricky, too.  It was a Monday right around the lunch rush (we have a talent, what can I say?), but we managed to find a table pretty quickly.  A waitress had drinks in front of us pronto & we browsed the menu.

I requested a Thai Iced Coffee & it was quite delicious.  I tried out the Thai Basil Signature which boasted chicken & lots of veggies.  The lunch special also came with a spring roll, so that seemed like enough.  I requested it to be extra spicy (as I always do at any Thai restaurant) & ended up with the same result: nowhere near spicy.  When I asked for the spice tray, I got a sideways glance, but I'm used to that by now.  The dish was quite good - a nice balance of flavorful chicken and fresh vegetables.  And the spring roll was great, especially with the dipping sauce.  Yum, indeed.  I couldn't eat everything, but I tried, dangit.  There was no point in a to-go box because I had picked it over so much.

I'm a fan of anywhere that stuffs you full of well-prepared food, is courteous, and gives you a cheap bill.  All the better!  Since the place is so small, it wasn't hard to get our server's attention, so we never lacked for anything.  They were basically friendly & obviously intent on getting you food & drinks quickly.  I'm definitely a fan & will return on my next trip."}
{"text":"Food flavors are tantalizing! Ambiance is serene. Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Thai food, and I've been to the others surrounding Mill. But this one wins. By far the best tasting Pad Thai in Arizona! 

It's atmosphere is great, their staff personable, and hours are amazing! If you want the best Thai experience in town, make this your first stop!"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, good service, nice wine selection, and most importantly, good food. Went to dinner with my wife, kids and in laws. Everyone enjoyed their food. Our waitress was lovely. Will definitely return. Btw... The chocolate lava cake was fantastic."}
{"text":"If we lived in Tempe (or anywhere nearby) we'd get take-out from there every week. Since we were visiting we got to sit in one of the high tables. The staff here understands vegan and takes your dietary concerns to heart. Lovely service as well. I cannot recommend this place enough."}
{"text":"the food here is good for the price but just ok when you consider other thai places in the area like thai elephant.  Its an ASU favorite and their Curries are the way 2 go.  I recommend at least trying this place and forming your own opinion."}
{"text":"My only experience with any Thai food has been here, so I have nothing to compare it to. But I still give it five stars because everything I have tried here has been delicious, between my boyfriend and I we have tried about six different dishes and everyone as yummy as the other, I'm confident I would enjoy anything on the menu here."}
{"text":"Discovering Thai Basil has been one of the better restaurant experiences I've had in Tempe. Unlike many other restaurants so close to ASU, Thai Basil is not part of a chain or simply college food. The prices are reasonable though, and the place always seems packed with a diverse-age crowd. Sometimes this can be a problem as Thai Basil seems a little understaffed in the kitchen, and I've had to wait a half-an-hour for appetizers to appear at peak weekend hours.

It's always worth the wait though. The Tom Kha Gai Soup is excellent, as are the calamari, fish, and noodle dishes. I like to explore a menu, and I've never been disappointed here. Unlike some Thai places I've been, Thai Basil serves up nicely-sized portions, and they do ask (as seems to be the norm out here, but not back East) at what level of spice should your dish be prepared. 

Easilly the best Thai food I've had in Tempe, I would heartilly recommend Thai Basil even if it's slightly off the Mill festivus."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Stay away!!! 
Could not even wait until I step out of the restaurant to give a 1 star review. 

Ordered 'homemade' shrimp chip , which is not homemade, and the peanut sauce on the side is way too sweet.
Panama curry with beef = beef jerky soaked in sweet soupy curry.
Red curry duck was really soupy too. The duck meat was not even cut before serving to us. Think abt an entire chunk of duck meat cut only halfway and simmered in even more soupy red curry sauce.
I asked for some basil leaves on the side and the waitress brought me the tiniest basil and told me she could not give me more otherwise she will have to charge me. Come on, your name has 'basil' in it and I ask for a few stems and you are gonna charge me?!
Even worse, the rice was individually charged.... First time ever go to a Thai restaurant having Curry and need to pay for rice seperately .... Stay away from this restaurant ... There are plenty of good Thai restaurants around, don't come to this one."}
{"text":"The lunch special is cheap ($8-9), generously portioned, and comes out VERY fast (I was in and out in 35 minutes).  If you haven't forgotten your high-school algebra, you can easily solve the restaurant equation for the remaining variable--quality.  

The salad was just a tiny bowl of dressed lettuce with a few wisps of carrot.  The \"spring roll\" was fried (I expected fresh) and had no flavor to speak of.  The tom yum soup was okay.  The pad thai was...odd.  It was orange and glistened with a sort of gelatinous sheen.  There was one lonely piece of green onion and a few sprouts, but otherwise no vegetables (thankfully it DID have peanuts).  It actually tasted all right, but very different from any pad thai I've ever had.  The chicken had been grilled rather than stir-fried and lent a nice grilly flavor to the dish.  Also, there was tofu in addition to the meat.  

But--it WAS fast and cheap.  And the special runs from 11:30 to 5.  Also, the service was pleasant and the setting lovely.  I wolfed it all down because I hadn't eaten all day, but I probably wouldn't return."}
{"text":"Visited this place for lunch and dinner twice. 
There are hits and misses with all their dishes, but one thing is for sure, portion is too small and over priced. $6.50 for a tiny and I mean TINY bowl of tom yum soup is just outrageous. One vegetable dish was just crap, food court dishes had more ingredients than them. 

Services were ok."}
{"text":"We just love this place..great food in decent pricing..we'll keep coming back ! Some dishes are quite spicy so drink plenty of water"}
{"text":"Fresh, flavorful and vegetarian-friendly. All the curries are superb!

Ordering take out can be a bit difficult because the restaurant is small and can be crowded...order ahead!"}
{"text":"I've come here for a few times and not a time has ever disappointed me.  Their curry is GREAT!  It is always to the right level of thickness.  If you like spicy, basil chicken is highly recommended. Their pad thai is a must try as well.  Everything here is yummmm!"}
{"text":"I hate to say this but Thai basil doesn't serve tasty food anymore and the service is slower. I'd think twice to visit Thai Basil of I wanna eat Thai food in Toronto. They don't serve mango sticky rice, the pineapple fried rice was tasteless, the fresh spring  roll are also not good. DISAPPOINTING"}
{"text":"I was their first ever customer on August 8, 2005! Totally delicious food and warm hospitality. They sponsored High Trek Adventure Phoenix. I can't wait to return to the Valley of No Fun (jk) and swing by for a bite."}
{"text":"Pretty good food, nice people, small small restaurant. Disclaimer: you cannot eat in this restaurant. Take out, pick up, or delivery ONLY!

I came here after a cold night at elver park. Parking was pretty difficult and annoying to find (most spots are reserved for neighboring restaurants). It wasn't until I asked that I realized that patrons aren't allowed to eat there (no dining license). I was slightly disappointed, and my friends and I just had to order and leave.

The menu has the staples of Thai food: pad Thai, pad see ew, tom yum soup, etc. I ordered the spicy basil with a spice level of 3. Food took around 10 minutes to make. Friends ordered different menu items, and we all received a to-go box of rice.

Spicy basil dish with chicken was pretty good. Mixing the rice and sauce at the bottom made it pretty amazing. Also, very very spicy. If you can't do spicy, I'd recommend a 1 or 2.

Best part of this dish was eating it the next morning. Something about eating this meal with the rice soaked in all the sauces overnight made it better than eating it fresh. I recommend mixing the rice in right away and letting it sit as long as possible.

Overall, I liked this experience. I don't like the location, parking, or the inability to eat inside, but the food makes up for it. I wouldn't say it's authentic Thai food, but it's still pretty good!"}
{"text":"Really 4 stars, but with only two reviews, I'm going to boost them up to an even 4.

Thai Basil is the 5th restaurant in the continuation of the empire of Thai Basil which is ravaging the valley.  Same great quality here.  Same freshness and variety of flavor that is known across campus.

What's an improvement to this one is this has bar and grill.  They have a nice small selection of beers and wines, including thai beer.

A few dishes differ from the other Thai Basils, including what I had, the Crying Tiger.  I had never heard of this.  What it was, was a grilled steak with a fresh green chili sauce.  Really tasty and fresh, the chilis being fresh brought a different spiciness, which can come back to haunt... 

Went back for Happy Hour, which is from 4-6 every day but Sunday.  They have a nice selection of 1/2 off apps and also some salads (including the aforementioned Tiger).  Fresh salads for happy hour is a great addition to my after work snack repertoire.  $2 domestics and $3 imports (including Kirin)

Thai Basil has notoriously good veggies in their dishes, excellent curries and noodle dishes.  A good place to introduce newbies to Thai food and a place that will continually draw you back on weekday nights for hearty, healthy, tasty thai foods."}
{"text":"Very good service. We happened to go in on a slow part of the day and my friend and I were the only ones in the restaurant, which usually results in being ignored in smaller places. But instead, everyone jumped up to serve us and was very polite. The food is always amazing and the atmosphere is very comfortable."}
{"text":"Food was fast and delicious.  The  customer service was attentive. I ordered the pad see yew spicy seafood. Also, they're portions are generous."}
{"text":"If I could give this place 10 stars I would. The food is delicious, the service is excellent, and the prices are amazing. I've been here at least 10 times and I haven't been disappointed once. The yellow curry and the spicy noodles are my favorites. You cannot beat this value!!!!"}
{"text":"I can't believe I've not written a review for Thai Basil yet but I went there last weekend for dinner with a friend and it reminded me I should! 

I saw another reviewer mention large portions and I want to second that, you definitely get enough to eat with a huge bucket of rice (I normally end up with lunch for the next day too!) And the food is delicious. I like spicy food but am a bit of a baby with what I consider \"spicy\" so I normally order the mild dishes and they're plenty spicy enough for me. Spicy or not, the flavor combinations they have (which you can customize with what type of meat/fish/tofu you want) are mouthwatering.  

The prices are decent too so you won't be blowing too much cash on dinner/lunch - and like I said, you'll probably get leftovers for another meal as well."}
{"text":"First time ever at Thai Basil. This location is SUPER small inside and they were somehow able to accommodate a table of 11 at noon. Service was fast and food was on point. Coworkers have said it can be kind of hit and miss but I was pleasantly surprised. I had the Thai Basil Chicken lunch special, it comes with a salad, rice, and an egg roll for $10."}
{"text":"While I don't deny the food is delicious, in my opinion CUSTOMER SERVICE means a lot.
I have had 2 obnoxious customer service issues with this restaurant. 
1.  Went there with children (7 year old) who doesn't eat meat or eats too much.  When we asked if they could make plain noodles we were told no by manager/owner, then they changed their mind and took chicken out but still charged $9.00. They would NOT adjust the price for removing the meat, nor would they make a smaller portion.....NOT nice!!!! poor waiter was mortified at the stinginess of his \"boss\". 
2. The entrees are substantial and beg to be left overs. They are initially served with about 3/4 c. of rice (not enough for the size of entree) when I requested more rice to take with left overs, she charged me $1.00 for an even smaller portion to take home!!!  These were already $9.00 dishes! 
My point is.....why couldn't she just be nice and give me the the damn rice? and Smile for crying out loud.
I will not be going back!!!!!! Just RUDE money grubbing! 
Thai Elephant from here on out....worth the drive for sweet sweet nice service!!"}
{"text":"Good food, the curries are very good the Pad Thai is OK (would be better if there was some fresh bean shoots and no ketchup in it). I liked the variety of teas. Good service"}
{"text":"So this place get's an extra star for being a great delivery place with friendly service. The food was piping hot, we live about 5 minutes away, and very good. Babe and I had Pad Thai, one with tofu (me), she had the chicken; we also tried the pot stickers. I am impressed the Pad Thai had great flavor and I enjoyed the tofu, and the rice noodles were al dente. The pot stickers have the usual sauce but I enjoyed it more because it wasn't as salty as other places. I don't know why we waited so long to try this place being in the food delivery desert between Madison and Verona, but we will definitely be ordering from them again very soon."}
{"text":"Having been greatly disappointed to find that a particular dim sum resturant which I was searching for was closed, I came across this gem.

Thai Basil offers authentic Thai food in a very relaxing environment. The host is very friendly and the service is spectacular. I had the chicken pad thai lunch special and it was super cheep. For $7.95 I got a salad, spring roll, and soup as my starter and the chicken pad thai as my entree. The thai ice tea is not bad either.

Beyond being a great value, the food just flat out taste good."}
{"text":"The green curry is soo good. I've come back twice in two days for it. I got the \"hot\" with chicken and it was perfect, the curry was very flavorful, and the takeout was just as good (and still very hot even though I came 45 minutes later). They will definitely see me again and again since I live down the street from here. I'm not sure if they do the lunch special listed online though, cause both times I was charged full price. But I'm excited to try something else next time."}
{"text":"This place was a huge disappointment.  I saw the reviews but still came here against my better judgement because I was in a hurry.  I ordered the \"Thai basil\"(supposedly their signature dish) with chicken to go.  It came out really quickly which is probably another reason why it was so bad.  

One word that should never be used to describe thai food is bland and this was BLAND.  The sauce was really thin and watery and the dish tasted like very lightly seasoned steamed chicken and vegetables.  On top of that I also ordered it medium spicy so I can only imagine what mild would taste like(boiled??).  The one pro with this dish was that you didn't have to eat much rice with it considering how unflavorful it was so...."}
{"text":"Best Thai I have had so far in Arizona. I would come back any time I thought of wanting to eat Thai or getting a craving for it."}
{"text":"We went as a party of two.  

Food: We ordered the dinner combo for one ($16), that came with a spicy thai soup, 2 spring rolls and 1 pad thai entry.  We added an order of red curry duck ($14).  The  combo for 1 was a good deal as it had enough food to feed both of us.  About the red curry dish, I would not order the duck or even any meat next time.  There were 10 pieces of duck meat in the bowl only, and they were nothing special.  The red curry was rich and thick (authentic thai curry is not watered down) and was the true star of the dish, so I didn't regret ordering it.  If we had ordered the vegetarian version, we would have saved $4 and would have enjoyed it just the same.  The spring rolls were standard.  The pad thai was not bland as all, as opposed to the comments of other yelpers.  I guess they have changed the recipe based on the yelpers' comment.

Service was friendly and super fast.

We found the decor amazing.

All in all, we enjoyed the meal and the experience. We would come back again."}
{"text":"I ordered a shrimp, chicken, and tofu Pad Thai last month and had it delivered using Grub Hub. All of my directions were followed, the food was still hot, and their portions were generous."}
{"text":"Have been here twice, once for dine in, once for take out. Thai Basil is in a good location close to ASU and the prices are very reasonable and portions are big. It's a basic small Thai Resturant (nothing fancy - basic decor and ~ 14 small tables) but the food is well worth it. 
I always order the pad see ew and it's really good. 

NOTE: they do not serve alcohol. 

However they are conveniently located right next to a bottle store. If you're looking for good Thai food at a good price this is the place."}
{"text":"Portions are good size. Taste is excellent! 
Our server she was very nice. 
Great place!!"}
{"text":"This is a good restaurant. I liked the atmosphere and decor. It just seemed a little weird to me that they are a Thai restaurant with a sushi bar. I tried some of my husband's sushi and didn't love it. I ordered red Thai chicken and it was very good. The only thing was that I ordered a 6 in spiciness and it was definitely a 10 or something. Couldn't eat much of it, thats how hot it was and I actually like spicy. We are a regular at Thai Grill and there I always order a 6 and I end up adding hot sauce to my food. Service was ok. Restaurant doesn't have super authentic Thai food and I think maybe they should focus only on one thing, either the sushi bar or the Thai food. I'm not sure if I will go back just because Thai Grill is so much better with a much bigger menu."}
{"text":"I worked here back in 2011... and was able to try most of their dishes... so I am soley reviewing on the food ONLY.

Haven't been here since 2012...so I'm not sure if the menu has changed but...
Things to try/order:
-crispy rolls, cheese rolls
-crying tiger: the green sauce is to die for!! Dip your meat in it!
-spicy noodles: similar to pad see ew w/diff veggies &sauce
-tom yum:
-pad see ew
-pad thai: automatically comes w/tofu so add diff protein!
-spicy fried rice & pineapple fried rice
-spicy beef salad
-papaya salad
-mango with sticky rice

These were all my favorite appetizers & dishes at Thai Basil.
I really like how you can pick your level of spice.  I love love love spicy food and can handle my spice very well.. I would usually go with medium or medium+ (btwn medium & hot)  
I don't recommend going Thai hot...because that stuff is literally fire!!! 

Parking is kind of limited...I remember one summer, the restaurant would get so packed... there were actually customers waiting!"}
{"text":"Walked in Friday night around 7 and got a table for 2 right away. We ordered the Thai BBQ pork to start which was delicious but the sauce it came with has a really strong kick to it! The pad Thai I ordered wasn't bad and the portions are huge! We both had to pack up our food for the next day as we barely touched half of it even though we came starving. Perhaps consider sharing these dishes :)"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my entire experience at Thai Basil. It was in a convenient location especially for college kids attending ASU. It was a cute little restaurant and I loved how it was set up. They decorated with a bunch of Thai knick knacks, and played very relaxing music. It was altogether a peaceful place to eat unlike most restaurants that are loud and obnoxious.

I never knew that I liked Thai food until I went to Thai Basil. The food tasted so fresh and it was presented very well. They always start you off with a fresh bowl of soup when you first sit down which was of course delicious. Everything I ate was amazing and i felt healthy and satisfied after eating.

All of Thai Basil's  staff were super friendly to their guests. They always gave you what you asked for and didn't make mistakes. The only minor improvement they need to make was their communication using English. I think it would really enhance the restaurant if the servers could really have a conversation with you and they could interact more."}
{"text":"Great quality authentic Thai food!"}
{"text":"Another exceptional lunch at Thai Basil! 

Pleasant service and a calm, clean atmosphere make this a go-to whenever I find myself in Phoenix. 

I always order the same dish and I am never disappointed. The Thai fried rice comes loaded with carrots, cabbage, broccoli, peas and your choice of meat and seafood. You receive a spring roll with your meal, which is closer to lumpia. Delicious! I always find myself ordering an extra side of the sweet and sour that comes with the spring roll because it compliments the rice so well.

Almost forgot to mention the complimentary salad you receive at lunch. Simple salad, but the dressing is to die for! (I also hear you can buy some to take home now!)"}
{"text":"Food is hit or miss. Hated the calamari and fried rice dishes. I do like the yellow curry quite a lot."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Thai Basil. This place is super busy every time I order from there, but they always get my order ready promptly and accurately.. and are always so friendly. If you call for delivery and they are too busy, they may have stopped taking delivery orders for the night....so just be prepared to possibly switch to carry out on a busy night. I'd rather have a place honestly tell me they are too busy with deliveries and not deliver, then take the order and take forever to get it to me. So I'm totally fine with that. The food is so good, and they are very good at getting the level of spice perfectly for my husband and I. If you like Thai food, you will not be disappointed with Thai Basil."}
{"text":"We were staying at a hotel nearby and were able to walk here before they closed. I had the green curry which was really good. Everything came out really quick and the server was friendly. Loved the decor inside just don't look up. The air vents were pretty disgusting looking. Lots of outdoor seating as well. Overall good experience and convenient to both the Hampton inn and Hilton."}
{"text":"Not the best thai restaurant. It is just an average. The food was lacking its flavor. Not so authentic at all. The restaurant is clean and well decorated. The soup was ok. The location is very good for the student."}
{"text":"I have to appreciate the fact that they deliver, but OMG it is not worth their prices.  The entrees (even soup and salad!!!) cost $8.95+ and the appetizers are $5.95+ while the portions are mediocre at best.  I can order delivery from any Asian outfit and get twice the food for half the cost.  The quality and taste of the food here is just average.  Fool me once, shame on you..  fool me twice.. haha... ain't gonna happen.  It's just sad that a really good, authentic Thai restaurant in this location was replaced by a money-hungry chain."}
{"text":"Just ate a meal here after the name was changed to Thai Season... had to throw my Pad Thai in the trash after a few bites because it was so plain and nasty. Some of the vegetables weren't even cooked!"}
{"text":"We were around town and I remember going to Thai Basil when I was in high school. The dishes were good back then.... The interior of the place is really dated. They have the same furniture for more than 7 years.You can even see filth on the chairs. I was pretty grossed out but I sucked it up.
 I can see this business becoming  better in the future if they fix things around.
However, the service was on point!

The food is okay. The appetizers were better than the main entrees we ordered.
For appetizers we ordered the fried calamari which was pretty good. 

For entrees we ordered the panang, pad thai, and fried rice.

The panang was NOT GOOD. It tasted like it came from a can. I was pretty upset about this because panang is one of my favorite dishes and I was disappointed of the outcome.


The pad thai was okay needed more flavor. We asked for a spice level 7 and it tasted like a 0! WTH??

The fried rice was decent had good flavor but the shrimp looked a lil bit raw. Thankfully I was okay. 

I feel the chef needs to go to other Thai Restaurants and taste their competition because the menu needs help!!!!!"}
{"text":"2.5-3 stars. Food is 2.5 stars. Decor and atmosphere is 3 stars. Multiple flies around our table, doesn't feel clean. Food crumbs all over the floor. 

Pad thai - tofu was horrible, has a weird taste as if it were stale. Flavour was lacking, overall a very bland signature dish. Chicken was tender.

Tom Yum noodle soup with shrimp - flavour was okay, noodles were bloated, shrimp hd a fishy taste. Both dishes were not served at optimal hot temperatures. 

Demographics - mostly caucasian, minimal asian. Dimly lit with background music. Will not return."}
{"text":"Good warm soup for a cold day! I don't remember the name but it had mushrooms. Tried a bit of the thai basil chicken and also had a good taste. A small, cozy place, with good service and happy costumers. Good to share with groups."}
{"text":"Thai Basil has become a lunchtime staple for me and my coworkers. It's not my favorite thai place in town but for a quick, filling lunch for under $10 this place is great.

I usually rotate through my three favorites - the pad thai, the thai basil and the thai basil seafood. Every entree is served with a bowl of soup, a generous portion of rice and a small but tasty eggroll. it's not uncommon to have leftovers or to head back to work stuffed.

The place is small and tends to fill up at lunchtime but we've never had to wait real long if we have to wait at all. The service is quick, we can get in and out in under an hour."}
{"text":"I love Thai Basil and this location especially, despite its small size! Love the intimate atmosphere created by the low lights, soft music unobtrusively playing in the dinning area and the medium stained woods and browns of the decor.

The food is fresh, tastes amazing, and even when they're super busy, comes out fast. I think this is the best Thai I've ever tasted. 

The staff is always friendly and seem good about anticipating the needs of their customers. 

Tonight, my friend from out of town ordered the glass noodle soup with tofu and I had the green curry with tofu. He really liked the food and managed to finish his soup even though he had some of my curry and he typically doesn't eat much. He said it was so good he had to finish it. 

He even suggested that we come back again some time while he's in town! I will definitely be back and will try to bring my friend one more time before he leaves."}
{"text":"Excellent Thai AND inexpensive! Spring rolls, pad see ew and green curry all fantastic, drunken noodles also good but a step down. Whenever I'm back in Tempe ill be back at Thai Basil!"}
{"text":"Not impressed. The food was OK not great.  Massaman curry was good with chicken. The fish cakes were tasty and the mango salad.  The Basil chicken was OK not awesome. Garlic beef wasn't good at all.  But worst of all was the service.  It was horrendous.  The slowest service I have had in a long time.  Just too frustrating."}
{"text":"Great Panang curry! I wish they had lunch specials, though :-("}
{"text":"I got lost looking for a client and stumbled across Thai Basil. The interior is nicely decorated and they even had a sushi bar - odd? 

My waiter was spot on with service and Thai Basil offered a good selection of different Asian cuisine - Japanese, Thai, Chinese and even Vietnamese Pho are offered here! 

My order the Bento box which started with miso soup - and my Bento box included basil shrimp, spicy tuna roll, rice, tempura veggies, crab cheese won tons and edamane. The quality of the basil shrimp was tasty and flavorful, spicy tuna yummy, tempura veggies greasy, crab cheese won tons crunchy tasty and edamane tasted dated.

Overall a decent lunch with a nice atmosphere but I felt the food could have been of higher quality. Maybe they are trying to offer to many selections and choices?"}
{"text":"We ordered take out last night. I had the pad thai and my partner had the panang curry. Both were yummy!  Delivery was faster than predicted! So great! We'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"My wife and I are huge fans. We mostly go there during lunch. They have an excellent lunch menu. Very reasonable and VERY tasty. 

My wife and I travel a lot and we have had Thai food from many cities and this is one of the best in terms of overall value. 

The green and red curries are excellent. The yellow curry and pad thai is so-so; I would stay away from the udon noodles....I dont know why they even have it on the menu. 

Overall it is one of our favorite thai places in the city.."}
{"text":"Within walking distance of my hotel and recommended by the staff. There are great lunch deals there, plus air conditioning to get out of the Tempe heat. 

$7 for soup, pad thai, salad and thai iced tea. It's less than $10 for tax plus tip. Not bad. I have to agree with the other Yelpers about the crappy service. It has such yummy food that I want to rate higher, but I can't do it."}
{"text":"Dang this stuff is gooooood! Red curry w/chicken, spicy noodles w/beef, cashew dish (with tofu which I dont care for but the rest of it was good) and spring rolls - small, crunchy, even after take-out! 
The red curry is damn near perfect and I can taste every ingredient that goes in it. The noodles, too - the food isn't overcooked nor is it overly spiced. And I like spicy. but I also like to taste my food, so yeah, I dont need to see through time while the heat radiates from my forehead while I eat! The ingredients are fresh and the food is light. I don't like rice too much but I had it to soak up some of that outstanding curry and I still don't have that \"heavy\" feeling from overeating... and man, did I overeat. HooWHEE I stuffed myself."}
{"text":"The Thai Basil on Central is my favorite midtown Thai restaurant.  Super fast service and friendly staff are just the start. The curry here is amazing, though my husband and I agree they are usually skimp on some of the ingredients like potatoes.  I usually can't get my curry as spicy as I ask for (either I'm becoming desensitized or \"Thai Hot\" doesn't mean hot at all here) but that's really the end of my complaints.  If you want a fast, hot meal that's flavorful, Thai Basil is your joint."}
{"text":"Best! Best! Best! Service EXCELLENT FRIENDLY. Food DELICIOUS PERFECT. Dont ever change love this place definitely our favorite anytime"}
{"text":"I love this place! So many vegan friendly options. Service is quick and they are very knowledgeable. The crispy spring rolls are amazing :)"}
{"text":"I have been to Thai Basil numerous times over the past few years. I used to like it, but their food has just become so bland that I won't be going back. I ordered the green curry for takeout and when I got home I was so disappointed. It was hardly green, really thick, and had no flavor. Seriously, it was so bland and definitely not worth the $10 cost of the dish.

Why is it so hard to get good curry around here? I bet I could make it myself and it would come out a whole lot better."}
{"text":"The eggplant with beef and spicy noodles with shrimp super delish... highly recommended."}

{"text":"Packed at lunch. Staff is nice and good is delicious! I always get eggplant garlic and it's full of flavor."}
{"text":"Overall experience:

 - Good service
 - Mediocre food
 - Nothing special about the atmosphere

I've heard good things about Thai Basil and I live in the area so I decided to give it a shot! Unfortunately, it did not live up to the hype as expected. I ordered the Tom Yum Goong Noodle Soup with Chicken. The food took about 15-20 minutes to arrive. To start off, the Tom Yum soup was quite bland and lacked a lot of spice to it. Not to mention, the chicken was very dry. A majority of the dish were noodles. For about $10, there are a ton of alternatives."}
{"text":"Always get their tofu pad thai, yummy. Probably should try more menu items to form a well rounded review."}
{"text":"Pad Thai was yummy as always, and it came with salad and a spring roll for lunch. I liked the dressing, wonder what it's made of. Initial service was prompt, and they brought the check out early, but it took them a while to pick up our credit cards. From the map it looks like you can get here from 3rd Ave but the shopping area is right off Central Ave."}
{"text":"Another stellar meal at Thai Basil. Came for dinner this time and noticed that my favorite dish (Mussamun beef brisket) is $10.95 during dinner. When I ordered the same dish for lunch it was $8.95 and it included white rice. Much greater value during lunch. Other than that everything is just as good as I remembered from the first visit. Most memorable is the curry sauce of course and it was once again so good that I poured it all over my fried rice and even the pad Thai."}
{"text":"We absolutely love this place! The pineapple curry is out of this world and the prices are great. The serving sizes are large enough to share and then have some left over. Love this place :)"}
{"text":"I'm a little biased because I've been to Thailand on multiple occasions and had the best Thai food I've ever had in my life for under 2 bucks, but this was pretty good. 

I had the larb Kai which had more tomato than just about anything else but nevertheless a good tasting larb Kai. My wife had the pad Thai which was pretty good but nothing special in my opinion. 

Nothing really stood out to me too much so I'd call it pretty average."}
{"text":"I have eaten here a few times and each time it was WONDERFUL.  They are efficient and can have you in and out about as fast as you want.  It is a small and wonderful place to dine and I recommend lunch.  

Each time I enter I am seated promptly.  The wait staff serves water and a wonderful soup.  The menu is easy to navigate and the wait staff are eager of offer suggestions.

I have tried a few items and seem to go back to chicken dishes.  The portion sizes are proper for lunch and I am generally out in 30 minutes or less.

They have excellent sauteed vegetable dishes along with curry.  They also adjust the \"heat\" to accommodate your taste buds.

If you out and about and want a great lunch - you will like Thai Basil!

{"text":"This location has THE WORST THAI FOOD AND CUSTOMER SERVICE I have EVER had the displeasure to experience. I would give it negative stars if I could."}
{"text":"I'm not a big Thai food fan, so I honestly can't really compare it to anywhere else, all I know is everything I had there was awesome.
The restaurant is pretty small but right on the corner so it's easy to find. Really nice decor and pretty chill. I ordered the Pineapple Fried Rice and spring rolls. I've never seen pineapple put in fried rice and was concerned, but I tried it and it was awesome; full of flavor and delicious. Same goes with the spring rolls.
Great little place to grab some lunch."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious lunch. I had drunken noodle and my spouse had pad thai.  Nice servings and just very flavorful.  Did crane quickly, too. Service great!"}
{"text":"Great lunch deal - as an ASU employee I eat here all the time and its pretty good every time. The veggies & meat always seem fresher than some of the other Thai places around campus, and (I think?) it is family owned, as I always see the same older couple working both lunch and dinner shifts. Also great for take out. I probably eat here way too much..."}
{"text":"This place is constantly delicioussss. A coworker introduced me to this place and I can't get enough of it.  I've gone over ten times now for lunch and I have not been disappointed yet. I have tried the Thai basil signature dish with chicken & mild spice. The garlic dish like above chicken & mild spice & the fried rice which I think is the first thing on the menu again with chicken and mild spice. The portions are good and if you eat in they serve a free delicious little peanut sauceD salad free of charge. The inside restaurant is small but well decorated and clean and they have a nice outside eating area as well although I don't think they compensate the heat with misters. The only thing is in my experience if you have a large party be very attentive to your change & make it clear you want separate bill from the start. Splitting the bill seemed to cause them a lot of confusion. Other than that service is great. They're quick and attentive. All in all the food is amazing I'll always come back."}
{"text":"Easily BEST AUTHENTIC THAI MADISON! Also, liked that they've allowed me to customized my dish an they were willing once to stay open 10 extra minutes after I called order in at closing time. :-) Panang is The bomb! ~ Yet everything is so darn delish!"}
{"text":"This is so wrong they charge $10 for shrimp Tom Yum soup and there is only one shrimp in the soup NO NOODLES included for that price that is outrageous shame on them ONE SHRIMP ONLY for that price!"}
{"text":"Come to Thai Basil if you have a craving for great Thai food, but don't want to pay a lot or wait very long. This local watering hole for ASU staff is a great option for lunch because their prices are great and their wait time is very low. Enjoy great food, good service, and a enjoyable atmosphere at this Tempe favorite."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here for our first date and since then we eat here at least one a week we love it!! Always ask to sit in the back it's a way cooler ambiance also not only are the prices super cheap but the food portions are huge and amazing! Always good and fast service when I go to thai basil I am never disappointed!"}
{"text":"Great food, rather pricey but it is nothing but quality.  Take out is quick, and the service is great and always kind"}
{"text":"I asked the waiter what the house special curry is and he told me it was the panang. So I ordered the panang with veggies and tofu, no meat ($9). Screw you, little Asian man. You should've warned me your special curry sucked. 

Okay, in all fairness, it didn't suck. It just didn't taste great, as panang should (see: Komol). It was marked with an asterisk, meaning spicy. I'm a wuss when it comes to spicy food, but that ish did NOT phase me. Spicier things have come out of my ass. 

My cousin ordered golden tofu (NOT like Chinese stinky tofu; $6). Its like, battered in tempura-like stuff and fried and served with a shoyu-ish sauce ... ish. That was better than my stupid panang. You don't fuck with panang. 

Anyways. The place was decored with cheesy Asian furnitures. Like shoji screens and seats with random kanji. 

Oh, and they had a sushi bar. And the menu had moo goo gai pan. It wasn't so much Thai, as it was randomly Asian. 

The help was really friendly, though. I guess you need to be if your food sucks.

The lunch specials were a decent deal, my thai basil chicken was pretty decent, but her chicken pad see ew was not at all. The chicken was really not fresh and had a weird texture.

{"text":"Thai restaurants seem to be popping up everywhere but this spot is really the best. The staff is extremely friendly and even during peak lunch/dinner hours they ensure drinks are never left empty. 

The food is crazy delicious. The thai basil pork is one of my favorites or the seafood pad-see-ew (also great with chicken)."}
{"text":"The prices were quite fair. Ordered the chicken pad Thai and chicken green curry. Pad Thai was your typical pad Thai that you would find anywhere else, nothing special. The green curry was very flavourful though. Overall, reasonable pricing for decent food."}
{"text":"Had a variety of dishes here (ranging from Pad Thai, to their chicken entrees, to the Tom Kah soup) and all of them were run-of-the-mill and not as epic as the rating would imply."}
{"text":"Food-wise, I think this place may have deserved 2 stars. I'm from the Bay Area, and the Thai food there is delicious!

The coconut soup wasn't what i expected-- the taste was okay, though a bit watery. I liked the lemongrass in it.  then we had Rama's Favorite, which was basically beef with peanut sauce. more like peanut butter-- the peanut was overpowering. 

the WORST part was the food poisoning-- both my fiance and i subsequently got vomiting, nausea, and diarrhea. i even had to bring him to the ER, it was so bad. I see Thai Basil is generally well reviewed here on Yelp, so maybe it was just an off day? but just warning you-- something we ate there was bad, and I think it was the Rama's Favorite."}

{"text":"I love Thai Basil!  It is hands down the best Thai restaurant that I have been to in Madison! My favorite dishes include the curry dishes especially the red curry.  I also love the chicken fried rice and the tom yum.  The service is pretty fast and they deliver which is awesome for Sunday night when cooking doesn't really feel like an option.  I have never had a bad meal there!"}
{"text":"I love Thai Basil. I have been eating here since they opened.  The sushi is amazing and delicious.  They have wonderful bento boxes, and the best Thai spring rolls in Las Vegas..the peanut sauce is the best."}
{"text":"The space of this location is tiny and I would not advise eating there. The food is not impressive. Pad Thai is the first thing I order when I try new Thai restaurants, and the Pad Thai at Thai Basil is not authentic and cannot compare to Siam in Glendale, AZ. I've tried their curry, it's edible, but there are better Thai restaurants in Arizona."}
{"text":"WOW! EXCELLENT food with EXCELLENT service! The teriyaki chicken is to die for! Very tender and flavorful! The bento boxes (Basil Chicken & Teriyaki Chicken) have more than enough portions, that there is no way an \"average\" person will least unsatisfied both mentally and physically. YOU WILL BE SATISFIED! 
The pad thai with chicken and shrimp is also worth mentioning. The combination of flavors blended well with my pallet. 
The pot stickers and crab wontons were also good, but nothing out of the ordinary."}
{"text":"My dish was bland, service wasn't great. There are plenty of other great Thai spots in Mesa & North Phoenix, I would go elsewhere. Not worth the price. The place was empty and the quality still wasn't even close to par."}
{"text":"Oh yes. And the search for the best Thai establishment in the valley continues. 

As usual, I was craving Thai tonight. Not that this is really a surprise. I wanted something decadent and full of flavor, spices, and heat. Due to talking I believe, we passed Thai Elephant which is what I intended to try and instead hit Thai Basil. 

I do have to give them props for having a seriously cute interior in a small plaza establishment. I was told that it's usually packed, which might've scared me considering how small it actually was. However tonight it was pretty slow. 

I ordered cashew chicken hot. The sticky rice was perfection and the cashew chicken was definitely hot. However, I didn't get all the flavor I have from other Thai places. I left wanting a little more in the way of flavor and spices. However, the dish was very fresh and healthy. 

I'll probably give it another try. Hoping it was just the dish I chose that was lacking spice and flavor."}
{"text":"Slightly better than average for Toronto for Thai food. Prices are middling. I go here because it's convenient and reliable. The lunch specials are a good deal and last in to late afternoon. My favorite is the cashew chicken."}
{"text":"Came to this place after reading good reviews and I was not too impressed. I expected get a authentic Thai food but the food here is Americanized. Nothing wrong with that since many of the clientele are not Thai. I ordered the Thai Ra Na which is supposed to be flat noodles stir fried with Chinese broccoli & meat, and served with brown gravy. Dish came out and made with regular broccoli and the did not have brown gravy. Noodles were not the traditional flat noodles. It tasted ok but not what I expected. In addition they do not serve sticky rice which Is a must for a Thai restaurant. First Thai restaurant I have been too that did not serve sticky rice. Staff was very nice and spoke Thai well. They explained that do not get very many Thai clientele and made their food more American style since 80% of their customers are Americans. I can't blame them for that but Americans love authentic Thai food. I think they need to serve authentic Thai food and it would help their business. I recommend this place for anyone that wants simple fried rice and chicken. If expecting authentic Thai food then this place is not the restaurant for you."}

The guy who took my order was friendly and polite even read my order back to make sure it was correct... not bad.... I went 25 mins later to pick up my order and was very happily greeted and the got my order with a smile and it was nice.... Went home feeling satisfied with the service... if it was based on service alone i'd give it a 3 1/2 stars... 

but theres more....
 I ate my food... not the best thai food I have ever eaten but it was ok... ugh I start eating more... and what do I find???
 A FREAKING COCKROACH IN MY SOUP.... WTF?!?!  YUCK!!!
 No I didn't mistake it for some kind of herb... ITS A FREAKING ROACH! I'm sick to my stomach... I attempt to call them and guess what NO ANSWER! I'm sorry but I WILL NEVER GO BACK HERE AGAIN!!! It's obvious that their kitchen has sanitary problems... I'M DISGUSTED!!! Please be cautious on making the decision to eat here.... The service is great... but I will not order from here again.... make sure you check your food before you take a bite...."}

{"text":"My friend recommended it because his family orders take out from them and claims they have great food, but has never been to the restaurant. We arrive 30 minutes before closing time, they're very happy and seat us. (gotta love smiling workers!)

The seats are like sitting in your own dining room! The menu had lots of items, mainly main courses. I usually order pad see eew but it wasn't on the menu! Thankfully I had to ask and they had availability.

They serve sushi and pho also.

My friend who came back from Afghanistan tried to get away with ordering a drink by showing his military ID- all my friend had to say was \"You're very good at math, I like you\" xD our host was a great sport, he smiled even though he probably didn't understand the humor. So in that case, I ordered a glass of lychee sake. It is very good!

I was there with 3 other friends and I had a great time. My friend even claims the bathrooms are nice! Lovely decorated, I'll come back again when I visit the north side!"}

The food is very good.  It's always fresh and the place is very clean.

The place is adorned very nicely and it is pleasant to sit in there.

The restaurant seats a lot of people which is great if you go with a lot of friends, but it can get quite loud at times.

I had the mussaman curry and the coconut soup.  It was as always a very good meal, and fairly priced with lunch specials.

Lots of desserts and different teas.  Lots of teas.  The dessert rice is killer with the coconut cream!

They have increased the amount of desserts that they carry and now offer a mango sticky rice with ice cream as well."}
{"text":"Curry soup extra spicy with anything you want in it. Hella yelp yes... again hella yelp yes, 1000x, yelp yummy! Lunch specials moderately priced, and awesome service. If you must get Thai'd, bind yourself here. Completely fresh... no joke."}
{"text":"Thai basil, isnt the best thai food ive ever had. Spring roll sauce was too salty. had their noodle boat soup. it was lask of flavor. Then i tried the thai sausage, too salty. Was not able to finish the fiod. had to ask for a to go box, couldnt eat it the next day.
Hopefully they will consider cooking their food not too salty."}
{"text":"I really liked the decor of the restaurant. The waiters were checking up on us from time to time. The waiting time was not long, it was less than 10mins after ordering our appetizers and the same with the mains. The quality of the dishes were okay. The red chicken curry was rated 2 \"flames\" (spice level) but I did not find it spicy. I found the salads to be quite sweet.
I found the Tung Choi (garlic flavour) not salty, which is to my liking.
The Tom Yum soup was actually good."}
{"text":"Great price, yummy food, quick and friendly service!"}
{"text":"Beautiful waterfall as you enter.  My kids were mesmerized for the time it took us to be seated and get comfortable.  This is my parent's favourite Thai destination for eating.  They love the Thai green curry and fried rice and have probably tried most items on the menu.

They also like ordering the slightly chillied prawn cracker appetizers.

For my kids and I, we ordered the Bangkok style Pad Thai.  It was delicious.  Also ordered a clean chicken noodle soup that the children whacked.  

We ordered the mango coconut rice dessert and fried banana dessert.  Both were very good.

I took away a star because I felt the meal was a little pricier for what we received in terms of quality, quantity, and number of dishes."}
{"text":"Food was mediocre at best. Ordered their mango and green papaya salad with shrimps. It came with fish sauce and tomatoes that wasn't mentioned in their menu description. It would have been forgivable if their fish sauce was overly salty... I tried to dilute it with water and it was still way too salty. My friends ordered their Pad Thai and said it was flavourless.

It would've been a better review if they had better customer service but that was also a huge let down. I typically find great and friendly service at small Thai restaurants, this was not the case. Won't be back any time soon."}
{"text":"This is an update to my review from my first visit. I've become a semi regular here, so that's gotta mean something...and every time I come, the place is packed. Pad Thai is one of the measures of a good Thai restaurant.  If the Pad Thai isn't made well, it makes me question the rest of the menu.  The noodles and ingredients are fresh.  If you get the prawns, they are delicious and huge!   I've had several different curries.  I think their Masaman is my favorite.  The service has always been pleasant and quick. They have a lunch special, price is great. 4 stars only because it's really a small place, and tables are pretty jammed up close together and the parking can be pretty much the same."}
{"text":"Best Thai food hands down. They're yummy and have good portions as well. The staff is always polite and ensure that you receive good service, whether it be ordering take or or dining in. Highly recommend them!!!"}
{"text":"(Disclaimer: I don't know much about what authentic Thai food tastes like, having never been to Thailand... But here's my subjective opinion of Thai Basil.)

I just moved nearby this place, so I've been a few times over the last couple weeks. It's pretty good-- I've been in a noodle mood, so I've tried the spicy noodles, pad see ew, and pad thai (all with tofu). The spicy noodles were alright, but I was surprised to see they were made with skinny (linguine-width) noodles... Back home in NY, similar dishes always came with wide noodles.  But the flavor of the spicy noodles was pretty good, and I appreciated the generous amount of basil (makes sense, given the restaurant's name). 

Thinking I could assure myself wide noodles the next time, I ordered the see ew. But no! To be fair, they were wider, but still only about one cm wide-- where are the awesome monster noodles I love so much? It tasted ok, but didn't really compare to my favorite versions from home. The sauce was kind of boring, and it had normal broccoli instead of chinese. Eh.

Giving Thai Basil one more shot, I went back and got some pad thai for take out the other day. Now, this is where they shine, in my mind-- it was quite yummy, with lots of crushed peanuts and scallions and an overall a nice balance of flavors. The tofu was also fried just right. (Full disclosure: I did add a dash Thai fish sauce to the dish at home, just to pump up the taste a little bit...It doesn't seem to have any of those little dried shrimp bits in it, sadly, so I figured the fish sauce might help compensate for the lack of brine. It worked. Wish they used the dried shrimp, but this will do for now.)

The inside of the restaurant is pleasant by Tempe standards (as I've observed them so far), and the service was quite friendly both when I dined in and got take-out. It's the kind of place you could feel comfortable eating alone or with six friends, no sweat.

So that's the verdict-- decent Thai, certainly edible enough to satisfy a craving without leaving the neighborhood. Earth-shatteringly good? No. But the pad thai will probably end up being a frequent order for me because of the convenience factor. Now if only they delivered...!"}
{"text":"Would definitely come back again. We're visiting from la n found here on yelp. Great food and price and staff :)"}
{"text":"Low food quality 
Wont comeback 
Great atmosphere and interior 
If you are a thai expert you will get the low quality food
My pad thai tasted like burnt very oily and noodles low quality"}
{"text":"This place should not be affiliated with the Thai basil in downtown at ALLL....first off it doesn't even look like its run by Thai ppl....second the food I ordered is like Chinese style Thai food...my frd ordered the mango chicken and he said he rather goto Manchu wok....pad thai I ordered had too much sauce and it was sour, nvr again will I come to this place for Thai food....I gave it 2 stars because of the decor and that's it"}
{"text":"3.5 stars

If I have a hankerin' for Thai when I'm in the Annex, I always come here. The menu is extensive with all your standard dishes, and prices are good. I usually get the emerald curry chicken, classic pad thai, and mango salad to share. Their 'baseline' spiciness is considerably more spicy than most places, but you can still ask your server to dial the spice level up or down a notch. The place is simply decorated and nice. Service is unremarkable. I had a birthday here once, because it was one of the few places in the Annex that would take reservations on a Friday night. Also, I once saw Deepa Mehta having dinner here!"}
{"text":"This spot is the best for lunch. 

Drive up and there's plenty of parking. Walk in and seat yourself on inside or on their lovely outdoor patio. Their quick and friendly staff will promptly bring you waters and a small salad with their delicious and tangy signature dressing. 

Their dishes use a lot of fresh vegetables and can be ordered as spicy or not spicy if you need. When I'm feeling healthy, I'll order something with tofu and extra veggies. The tofu is soft and creamy, and in some dishes it is lightly fried, yum!

Finish off with a Thai coffee to fight the post-lunch lethargy and I'm ready to head back to the office."}
{"text":"The red curry is to die for. It is worth every penny and the portion sizes for dinner is enough for 2 meals. The service is attentive, but I typically take my orders to go. My go to Thai curry spot!"}
{"text":"Pretty swanky venue at reasonable prices. Got the pad thai - definitely tasting ketchup in there. Whomp whomp"}
{"text":"With all the recent rain I was in the mood for pho.A neighbor said that this restuarant served pho.Since it's only 2 blks from my house I decided to give it a try.It's safe to say that will be the last time going there for pho.No flavor in anything .The all important broth-no flavor the noodles-no flavor.It was just my bad luck that Jasmine Express (2 miles away) sold out of pho before dinner."}
{"text":"This was my 3rd time coming here with my boyfriend, and i must say their food is delicious! The place was so cozy and relaxing. This time I had wide noodles with oyster sauce, beef, and some vegetables (i believe it's #45 \"Pad See Ieu\" or something). It was so good! We will be coming back for sure :)"}
{"text":"Ridiculously awesome drunken noodles!  HUGE chunks of Tofu, which is nice, too.  Don't bother with the chicken satay- it was the smallest appetizer portion I've ever seen- less than 2oz for $6!  PLUS- they deliver all the way the heck out to my house!"}
{"text":"Best Pad Thai I've had in Phoenix! And I've tried several since moving here last year. 

Cute, smaller Thai place, but the decor is tastefully done. Friendly service and they do a great job of keeping diners in a tight lunch hour on schedule. 

The homemade salad dressing is amazing and I love the fact that the little salad is included with any meal. If you live or work near Park Central, I would highly recommend Thai Basil!"}
{"text":"Great thai food in Tempe, my go to in the whole Phoenix area! Chicken Phad thai and the gyoza are the best! Always busy, and a great environment. Highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"stay away from this place, they come off nice but they are ruthless and do not care about \"you.\"  for as empty as this restaurant is you would think they'd be different towards the customers. we would go in here 2-3x a week some times and itd be empty and id always take care of the sushi chef and servers....not anymore. this place is a joke when it comes down to true character. stay away stay away stay away....... most sushi chefs dont mind a little suggestion here or there, dont bother talking to this one, he takes things way to personal......want spicey salmon mixed in with a roll???? no chance!!!!! haha what a joke this place turned out to be, actually upset how much time/money ive spent with thai basil. i will be sure to let all my friends/family know to stay away, and there are much nicer friendlier places in the north to go to get better food than this. its ashame because the food isnt bad, its mainly the real rude chef behind the bar, but no food is worth crappy service no matter where you go. id leave 0 stars if i could."}
{"text":"We live close by so we frequent this restaurant for dine in and delivery.  The place is somehow hidden as it is behind a Chevron gas station, Taco Bell, and McDonald's. A bit difficult to find if you are not from the area.  The place is decorated to look like you're in Thailand with the redwood carvings and other Asian crafts.  The food is really good.  My daughters love their shrimp fried rice and deep fried tofu.  It sounds gross, but trust me, it is so delish.  Delivery is average wait of 30-50 minutes depending on what time of day you order.  Justin is very friendly as he is the one who often delivers our dinner.  We will continue to patronize this establishment."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat. Extremely polite and the food is amazing. Definitely a hidden gem. I've never brought anyone here that didn't love the sushi."}
{"text":"On the low side of mediocre. Not the vibrant, fresh flavors I have come to expect from Thai food. Underwhelmed. Do yourself a favor and go to Sala or Reign of Thai."}
{"text":"I had a pretty standard Thai food experience here. I got the basil noodles and the flavours were on point. They also respected me when I asked for the dish extra spicy and actually served it very spicy which was a pleasant surprise. For $11 a dish, I'm a fan of this place."}
{"text":"Still our favorite place to eat. The food us always fresh, each dish has it's own distinct taste (unlike other Thai restaurants that we've been to where many dishes seem to taste the same) The owner always treats us incredibly well & we never leave wishing we had gotten something else. I'm so grateful that this place is so close to our home and work."}
{"text":"My go-to place for Thai food, both dine-in and takeout. The pad thai and curry are both really good! I recommend coming for the lunch special and dining in. It's a fun little spot and the prices are fair. Even better, the service is good and the people who work here are really friendly.

If you choose to order takeout, make sure that you call the right number. There is another location off University and I have messed up and ordered from them before. The folks at this location were nice enough to cancel the first order and remake it for me. I think this happens to them a lot! Put it in your phone as a contact! You'll thank yourself."}
{"text":"Had lunch here before attending the Dec. Yelp Hours at Cartel down the street.  $6.95 Green curry w/ chicken called my name.  It's a good thing the server took my order before I had a chance to wait much longer- the noise level was driving me up the walls!  Sure, it was during lunch, but I've been here during dinner, too, and even though there were only four or five tables going at that time, the noise level was high.

Veggie soup with tofu came in a small bowl.  Lightly-salted, fresh-tasting, perfect to get the juices flowing.  Soon after, a plate with jasmine rice, an oval bowl of green curry, and a small eggroll arrived.  Took a bite of eggroll and was disappointed to see * in the mix.  This is the first time I've seen * in eggrolls served in a Thai restaurant... Thai coworkers tell me that's not the norm.  (Another inauthentic dish served here is their pad woon sen- silver-bean noodles with veggies, tofu/chicken, and egg.  TB serves it dripping with sauce when it should be on the dry side.)

Curry sauce was good, but looked too watery and not silky enough.  Medium-spiced, perfectly light.  However, the noise level, soggy pad woon sen, and eggrolls with * will keep me away."}
{"text":"My group cane here before a comedy show downtown.  The food was really good and it was walking distance from bars and the comedy venue.  The food was awesome and  the restaurant was nice for our double date."}
{"text":"Food is really good, I enjoy getting it for take out when we are in a rush, they are very fast!"}
{"text":"Stopped for quick lunch. Tom yum soup and egg roll with sweet dipping sauce was good. Ordered chilly garlic noodles and green curry with jasmine rice. Food tasted fine nothing extraordinary but not bad for a lunch pit stop."}
{"text":"Good food. Decent prices. Quick pick up usually only 15 minutes. But if you want a plethora of veggies and or meat you won't find it here. Maybe I'll ask for double veggies and meat next time I order. Stingy on rice with only one container for two curry orders at dinner... Come on... But obviously it's good enough that it keeps me coming back 4-5 times a month. Tip: when you say extra spicy they bring it and mean it but regular is mild. Hot also means extra spicy to them"}
{"text":"Delicious! Good service and fresh, flavorful food. Reasonable pricing. Locals must like it too...lots of takeout flying out the door."}
{"text":"This is one of the better restaurants in North Las Vegas the owner Frank and the staff are very friendly they do not have a high turnover of employees like most of the businesses in town and they stick to a high standard for customer service and they always provide good quality food at a reasonable price and the portions are very large"}
{"text":"The best massaman (sp?) curry I've ever had, and I've had a lot. And great pad thai as well. However, as a spice wimp, I asked for my dish as mild as possible, yet tons of red flakes peeked out from the noodles. There are only a few foods I am willing to suffer for, and the yellow curry was one of them, but I just don't get why so many cooks equate \"not spicy\" with \"bland.\" The dishes were plenty tasty by themselves; next time I go I will either have to order it \"bland\" or bring a fire extinguisher."}
{"text":"Great food and great drinks!  Lemongrass coconut smoothie was refreshing on a hot day.  Pad Thai was a bit bland but other dishes are great."}
{"text":"We had two lunch specials. Pad see ew, and rama chicken. Definitely not impressed with either of them, but there was a good amount of food for the price. For $8 bucks or whatever we got an iceberg pile with curry dressing, a friend spring roll, tum yum soup, and the enree. We took home about half of the entree, but both agreed that we ate less than we normally would have because we were uninspired. The quest for decent Thai food in toronto continues, but it won't be back here."}
{"text":"Best Green Curry I have ever had from a restaurant. Very well priced and absolutely delicious. My mouth is watering just thinking about the food. Also the Yellow Curry and Pad Thai are"}
{"text":"We had a nice meal here last night. we haven't been to this location before but noticed they are going through major remodeling and wanted to help support our community. We were surprised to see how many loyal customers showed up when the entire complex is chaos.  My husband ordered the garlic chicken, it was very mild and maybe could have used a bit more sauce to punch up the flavor. It was full of chicken and had a ton of veggies though, which I love. I had the panang - peanut curry with chicken and it was delish. Again, tons of protein and veggies and wonderful light curry taste. My husband and I also tried the spicy noodles with chicken, which was tied as a favorite with the curry. Great flavor and not too spicy. These dishes were reasonably priced and the portions were good size. I was pleasantly surprised how quickly or food came out and would absolutely come back to explore more of the menu."}
{"text":"This is definitely one of my favorite Thai restaurants. It is not too far from Phoenix College, and they have a great lunch deal. It's about $8 for a delicious house salad, and entree. I always get the delicious yellow curry which is served with rice, an egg roll and a slice of watermelon. The food here is so delicious, I come here at LEAST once a week when I'm in school."}
{"text":"Favorite thai food place I've tasted in a while. Not only are their prices way cheap for the wonderful quality of their food, their service is always quick and friendly. I guess you can say I might be a regular. Favorite dish is green curry, never gets old! Also the take out saves me sometimes when I'm too lazy!"}
{"text":"I got a take out order of Thai basil chicken when I was staying for a night at a hotel nearby.  The food was excellent."}
{"text":"The outside is deceiving! Walked in and the environment felt very warm, inviting, cool and romantic! I hate dining in bright light, makes everything feel loud. Luckily, at Thai basil, the lights are dimmed and jazzy music played in the background- finally a dinner place that's relaxing and easy on the wallet!

My boyfriend got the Pad Thai (we like to try this at every Thai place we eat) and it did not disappoint! As another reviewer mentioned, veggies were fresh and cooked just right! Great flavor and portion. I ordered red curry for the first time (I usually like green) and it was a hit for me too. Opted for medium spice and it was the perfect blend of flavorful and spicy but not to the point where your nose runs faster than you can catch. 

Overall a great date night and attentive, friendly staff. Love supporting local businesses that deserve it!"}
{"text":"Thai Basil has the best lunch specials! Super fast service and very convenient for an hour lunch break. I want to try something new but I love the Green Curry w/Tofu so much that it's hard!"}
{"text":"Today's trip to Thai Basil made me realize that I was cursed, and now thanks to this place, the curse has been lifted. 

I don't know how or why, but somewhere along the road of life, a curse got put on me - no matter how spicy I asked for my Chinese food to be, it would always end up MILD. 
I mean, I would say it 3 or 4 times to the person taking my order on the phone. Then i figured maybe if I spoke to the person face to face so they can see the sincerity in my eyes - the very soul of me - that maybe they would make my dish spicy. But no, they didn't. I've done everything short of putting a gun to the person behind the counter's head. 

I had just accepted the fact that I would never enjoy spicy Asian cuisine; that I would always have to go home add my own stuff to it. Well no more. Thai Basil has consistently asked me \"How spicy do you want it?\" 
Not only that, but they proved that this is not just a rhetorical question. I've given them a specific level, and they do it. They. Do. It. 

So the last dish I had was the Spicy Noodles with beef. It was great. The sauce was unique and tasty...not just a generic batch sauce. Of course there is always better to be had, but for a lunch special dish, this was quite satisfying. 

I just wanted to updated this review because of Thai Basil's consistency. I've never gotten a 'bad' dish from here...maybe one disappointing dish (smaller portion than I thought it should have been). 

4 star stat maintained."}
{"text":"Every time I go I have terrible experience. I realize that I should just stop going even if it means not eating out with friends. The curry I got tasted strange and not like any thai food I have ever tasted before. One time I had asked for extra mushrooms and there was no mushrooms in my curry. The service was never good and always have to ask for water. The thai basil on university was definitely not as bad as this place but the portions for lunch are so tiny. I will not return and do not recommend!"}
{"text":"The wait was ridiculously long. My group had to wait more than 20 mins for a table even with a reservation, and at the end we had to be separated into 2 tables. What is the point of a reserving a table then? 

Anyhow, the food was meh. We had a pad Thai, steam fish and chicken green curry. Nothing special. I know good Thai food are hard to come by in Richmond hill area so that why I rated a 3 stars. 

This would be a good option if you are looking to pay more $$ for Thai Express quality. It's definitely not worth my 20 min wait. Probably won't come back again at least not with a group more than 8. 

Disappointed."}
{"text":"This was really not very good. We went at lunchtime and should have been forewarned when the place was completely empty without even a member of the staff anywhere to be found. We ordered the $5 lunch special with an egg roll, soup, rice and an entree. The soup tasted like flavorless grease. I didn't know that rice could taste old until I tasted that rice. The stir fry was really heavy on the fish sauce or something sour and fermented tasting. But, the egg roll was tasty. I'm guessing it was frozen and not made here or it might have been as terrible as the rest of it. My husband liked his pad tai. I don't think we'll be back. Definitely not."}
{"text":"I stopped by Thai Basil with a coworker for lunch and was fortunate enough to find a parking spot. The restaurant is very small and the tables are close together, but it is always packed - which is a sign of how good it is. We both ordered the pad thai with chicken, medium spice - and even that was fairly spicy. Pad Thai is not the most adventurous meals, but it is still one of my favorites. A side of Thai tea and I was very happy. 

The service was good and the food arrived quickly. Two orders of Pad Thai chicken, one Thai Tea and a water = $17.29. Get there early to get a parking spot!"}
{"text":"Best Thai in Tempe! Get the sticky rice w/ mango--if I could I would eat 5 orders of it in one sitting"}
{"text":"Nothing special at all.
The food is flavorless
i came to eat here 3 different  times
 just thought maybe they had a bad day
but 3 strikes and im out.

this place is terrible
it just seems like they are getting lazier and lazier 
from the flavorless food to the lousy service.

high prices for cheap food and crappy service."}
{"text":"I was not impressed with this place.  However the staff was very nice and i didn't have to wait long for my order. . I ordered the pad thai chicken for lunch.  Price was ok but the meal itself wasn't.  Barely any sauce,  no flavor. Too many bean sprouts too...I'm thinking the deep fried tofu they put in it was to replace having to use more chicken?  Whatever the reason, it didn't make it any better.  
I've eaten a lot of thai food and this just didn't do it for me.  May try once more but not positive. Depending on how hungry I am.  Thanks for reading :)"}
{"text":"I seriously hate this place because of FOOD POISONING! My co-worker and I decided to pick up some Green Curry w/ chicken for lunch. The lady on the phone was able to persuade me to get the dinner serving for just $2 more. I agreed and when I went to pick up the food I was pretty impressed with how big the containers were because I thought I would be able to save half for dinner. I was very wrong. We barely ate a quarter of it and both of our stomachs started hurting really bad and than later in the day, I threw up. I called Thai Basil after work to let them know and the lady was very rude. She said it couldn't have been their food and it must've been something else that I ate because they just make a big pot for the whole day. I let her know that my co-worker also got sick and she just blew me off. She asked me what I wanted and at that point, I did ask for a refund since she was rude and didn't care. I hate asking for money back but if the customer service isn't there, than I will ask. She said they can only give me half of my refund back and nothing else. I picked up the money the next day and thno one said a single word to me about the situation. They just handed me the money and turned around."}
{"text":"This place is not that great for the price. Me and my husband went here during the 4th of July and ordered vietnamese pho, friedrice, vegetable spring roll for appetizer and their thai soup. The pho taste bland and the meat is overcooked. The fried rice was amazing. The vegetable spring roll has a kicked to eat and taste fresh. The soup is horrible. The red soup and seafood just didn't connect. Their customer service is decent. Overall 3 stars"}
{"text":"Consistently delicious and quick service every week. I've tried every lunch item and they are all fantastic."}
{"text":"Lunch was excellent.  Enjoyed the house special Chicken Basil and Mixed Veggie and added seafood.  Service is excellent and food came fast. Portions are generous.  We'll definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"The interior design for this place is one of those fancier asian cuisines. On the other hand the prices were fancier too. My friend and I ordered chicken pineapple fried rice, chicken pad thai and spicy pan fried eggplant and it came to about $35 excluding tips I think. 

The pineapple fried rice looked pretty in a cut in half hollowed pineapple. It was typical  fried rice but what disappointed  me was the lack of flavour and how poorly diced (more like randomly cut) the pineapple pieces were. The pineapple pieces were too  big to enhance the fried rice with any pineapple flavour... Their cashews weren't even tossed in the stir fry, raisins was okay, chicken pieces were big too but the portion was okay. 

Spicy pan fried eggplant with grounded pork was acceptable only because it was so salty and spicy that it complimented the bland pineapple fried rice. 

Will not go again because service was non-existing and was quite expensive for that quality of food."}
{"text":"This place is always a reliable place to go for Mongolian Beef.  It is never very busy.  The service is always good.  We usually have a couple of tuna sushi as an appetizer, and then Mongolian Beef for lunch.  I have tried a few other items on the menu, and they are so so, but the MB is excellent."}
{"text":"Average Thai fare. Overpriced. Service was poor."}
{"text":"Went for dinner one night  last week. I've tried many Thai restaurants in the valley, found this one quite good.   Had the Thai Basil chicken dish, delicious.  Will definitely try again."}
{"text":"We attempted lunch next door at the noodle joint but quickly ended that excitement with a lack of gluten free or veggie options. 

Next door we went and MAN, I'm glad we did. 

I ordered their signature dish and it was perfectly spiced (4, I like it hot!) and so good. Veggies were fresh and it came with steamed rice, a spring roll and a soup (though menu says I'd get a soup OR salad option and I was only given soup without choice). 

I'd definitely come back. All in our party were pleased."}
{"text":"Make sure they get your order right if you are doing takeout. Speak slow and loud so they understand especially the manager. They just ruined my meal. Ordered pad thai and got something completely different. I called to let them know so the other person doesn't get their meal confused with mine and the managers swears I called this order in. I didn't even know this dish existed the one they gave me. POOR VERY POOR customer service. So sad."}
{"text":"I came here during lunch and ordered the green curry  chicken. It is a part of their lunch special menu. The curry was good but they did not give many vegetables or chicken in the curry. It also came with a side dish/appetizer - soup and spring rolls. Soup was awful. But for the price you pay *lunch special*, you get a decent amount of food.
The evironment is perfect for a thai restaurant but the service is terrible. No water refills, took us 5 minutes to get a waitress's attention."}
{"text":"This has been my go-to thai place for sooo long. Their pad thai is incomporable and comes with large portions (especially for takeout) but I can never decide between that and the panang curry... so I usually get both.
Great atmosphere too, you just can't go wrong at this place.
I see lots of people getting the pineapple fried rice.. which is served in a half pineapple.
Come and enjoy!"}
{"text":"I ordered Chicken Pad Thai and it was a really dry rice (instead of noodle) dish. Kind of strange... Also they auto-tip themselves for takeout. Won't be returning."}
{"text":"After driving by this place a million times on my way to and from work, I finally got my chance to eat here yesterday for lunch with my work pals.

I really cannot complain about anything.  I loved my garlic vegetable dish with chili sauce and chicken.  The atmosphere was great and the place was very clean.  They never did ask if I wanted anything to drink, but I overlooked that since I was satisfied with water.  Prices were very reasonable....I really don't have anything negative to say. (there is a switch)  Now I have a new place to have lunch...."}
{"text":"This Thai restaurant is 100% legit - I highly recommend it. We had the Thai Spicy soup, the Coconut soup, and Pad Thai noodles  - everything was excellent. We were very surprised by the size of their soup bowls - they were huge! And the quality of the food was great all the way from the soups to the main course. We came here on a Friday night and it was not busy at all (I was surprised). Certainly coming back for more!"}
{"text":"I'm sorry, the staff were extremely accommodating and friendly but the food was terrible. The Tom Kha  was thin with very little developed flavor ( and the Panag curry was just terrible."}
{"text":"My wife is a big fan, and now I am too! She told me about the salad dressing and how yummy it is. I said ok but I'm getting soup because I love soup. We arrived on a Saturday and it was just a wonderful experience from start to finish. We did not even have to order salad, it just came to us right away. And salad dressing is zingy and super tasty! 
The WOW! A menu just for soups! Pick your broth, meat, noodle, and it comes in a big bowl as a meal. So many veggies in it. Even cabbage. Love cabbage cooked just right and not thin and witty. Carrots just right too. Soup has to be hot. It was! Love the spice, clear noodles, and believe it or not that soup somehow stayed hot the whole time I was sucking it down. Yeah, I think I highly recommend the soup. Service was good too but it was not busy. And I enjoyed my Thai coffee as well. 5 stars on this Thai-day Saturday!"}
{"text":"Not impressed. Had the spicy chicken noodle dish - noodles were over cooked and there was very little chicken. Plus not very flavorful. Way too many noodles, too few veggies/meat.

Red chicken curry was just ok. Small portion size.

For $15 at lunch and based on yelp reviews I was hoping for better."}
{"text":"Decent food and decently priced. They do offer all their soups as a cup for half the price, which isn't reflected on their page."}
{"text":"Had the massaman curry here and it was delicious. The Thai iced tea was also excellent. I forgot what my fiancé had but he enjoyed it very much. Great environment, very cute and also very clean. We went on a date here and the ambiance was charming. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Reliably delicious Thai in Central Phoenix.  The trick is to get your food to go, grab a tea from Starbucks next door and enjoy Starbucks' awesome patio (comfy seats and mature trees and city views, oh my!)."}
{"text":"Thai Basil is pretty solid. I do not recommend going from 12-1:30 pm as the place gets packed. The good news is even if you get there during the lunch rush it moves pretty fast. As soon as you sit down they place a small bowl of soup in front of you (it's basically broth with with carrots, celery, and cilantro). Nothing spectacular but it gives you something to do while you wait for your food. 

My favorites are the fried rice with chicken, BBQ Pork and the Red Curry, most dishes are served with rice, veggies and a small springroll. It's not blow your mind Thai but it is fast, decent and pretty cheap. I go here monthly for lunch."}
{"text":"Fast service, good prices, great Thai food!  It's the perfect lunch spot. They have outdoor seating as well. Everything on the menu is good!"}
{"text":"I travel a lot and I have sampled many Thai restaurants over the years and this place ranks towards the top. I give it four out of five.  And the price is fair. 

It's located by Arizona State University in Tempe. So they cater to the \"young, demanding\" crown, who want good food on a student budget."}
{"text":"I love this place. The staff are friendly and funny, the food is good and it's super close to campus. I ordered the Pad Thai and it was so good. So is the Thai and spicy fried rice. 
Anyway, the Pad Thai is one of the best I've ever had. Seriously. I mean, it's nothing like in California or Thailand...but for Arizona Asian food, it's super delicious. Anyone just come here to enjoy their food. That's all. They have great food, great service and even though they are close to ASU Tempe, they don't seem to be that busy.

Just come here. That's all."}
{"text":"Okay food, but horrible service.  I found the staff to be quite rude and likely will never return.

On top of that:
- The soup my wife ordered melted on the way home and spilt all over our car
- The meal my wife ordered made her quite sick
- One of the appetizers we ordered was not in our bag when we got home.

The sad part is, our favourite restaurant up the street called Sweet Basil recently shit down, and now this is the only alternative.  More selection needed in this neighbourhood."}
{"text":"I have now eaten at Thai Basil several times. Both times I have felt that the food was outstanding. I had yellow curry both times so I am particular to that meal. But as well their food is delicious as you can tell from the visitors enjoying their food. I would highly recommend Thai Basil the next time you're considering Thai food."}
{"text":"Amazing! One of my husband and I'd new favorite places. I ordered the Pad Thai with chicken and he ordered the red curry with chicken. Both were fantastic! The side of spring rolls were also great. We ordered all of it to go and all our food was ready earlier than expected. Amazing and authentic, will be going again soon!"}
{"text":"Why the low ratings? Food was great! I had the Thai basil w/chicken and requested it spicy. It was! No crowds on Saturday for lunch."}
{"text":"Their salad dressing... I would drink it out of the bottle if I could. It's got the heat, the tang, the sweetness, the saltiness... Everything going on but not too busy or confusing in flavor. Juuuust right.

Lunch at Thai basil was a first for me. As soon as you sit down, you get a glass of water and a salad. Even before you order or even ask for it. No choice of soup or salad, just salad. No complaints here but I did find it interesting they just give you a salad without asking.

I got the chicken green curry \"hot\". Someone on Yelp mentioned the spice level isn't as hot as it should be but for me, it was plenty hot :) my whole face was glistening with sweat as I slurped up that yummy curry. 

With the lunch special you get a salad, egg roll, your main dish and an orange wedge to finish your meal and a nice little mint with the check. There were not frills but simple Thai food done well."}
{"text":"I absolutely love their yellow curry and Thai iced tea. I travel a lot, so on my way home I frequently order take out from this location. The curry is always consistent and the server that usually works Friday lunch is very sweet and makes really good Thai tea. I've only eaten in the restaurant once and she waited on me then too. This is probably my favorite Thai place in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"This is the best Thai place that I have found so far in the valley. I am open to trying a new place, but I seriously never have a bad time here. I've been here probably 30+ times with family and friends. Most importantly, my first date with my girlfriend of 5 years was at this very spot. She's the most wonderful person in the world but that doesn't mean my 5 star is biased.

This place's food quality is GREAT. Very fresh vegetables that are crunchy and colorful, great Thai iced tea, and well cooked rice. The tofu never disappoints, but I am partial to the beef. My favorite dish is the rama, which is basically a vegetable (and your choice of meat/tofu) saute with a nice, creamy peanut sauce (available on the side for dipping or smothered on top of the dish). Great stuff if you're into sweeter entrees. I also highly recommend the red or green curry.

No alcoholic beverages here (at least I don't think they have them) but their food has much more focus because of this. The servers are extremely friendly, too."}
{"text":"The worst Thai Basil around. Nothing tastes right, watered down flavors. I've always loved Thai Basil but this place isn't right. I hate giving a bad review but I also hate being served bad food"}
{"text":"First and foremost, Thai Basil consistently tastes great. There have been weeks when my girlfriend and I have eaten here a shameful number of times, simply because the food always tastes fantastic. She gets Pad Thai, I get Panang Curry, and everyone's happy.

But I'm giving Thai Basil four stars because there's one nagging problem: while quality is consistent, nothing else is.

For example, I usually order my meal spicy. Sometimes that means it's pretty mild, sometimes that means it's unbearably hot. Sometimes the noodles are drowned in sauce, sometimes they're fairly dry. Sometimes the plate comes with crushed peanuts on the side, sometimes it doesn't... and then I kind of miss the crushed peanuts. Sometimes the plates are massive (at times, I've been able to spread out one order of Pad Thai over four meals), and sometimes they're not. Sometimes the miso is super-salty, and sometimes it just tastes about as salty as miso usually is. No matter what I order, no matter how many times I go, there's always something about the meal that surprises me.

That being said, those surprises have never spoiled my meal. I've always left Thai Basil satisfied with my choice, looking forward to my leftovers, and happy with the service. No matter what surprises they throw at me, a return visit is almost always guaranteed."}
{"text":"There is a lot of sushi and Chinese food here. It's not authentic and is the worst I've had in Vegas. The Thai beef salad for instance is just a salad. At a spiciness of six, it didn't even seem hot. The Thai tea, however, is delicious and unique. Try the Nom Tok at Krung Siam at a six and you will love and feel every bite."}
{"text":"You cannot go wrong here - pick your favorites. My favorites are Pumpkin Curry with Chicken, or just Red Curry with Chicken. I also LOVE the Pad Kee Mao (Drunken Noodle) - I want to try their Thai Basil dish but haven't gotten to it! This place does it right...... forget 4 star reviews."}
{"text":"We love this place! Justin was an amazing and attentive server and the food was great! This will definitely be our go to Thai place close to home."}
{"text":"We ordered a whackload of takeout for a team lunch today. Probably won't be eating there again anytime soon.
Completely average thai food, my mixed veggies were limp and the oyster sauce was more like garlic salt sauce. They also forgot a bunch of stuff on our very uncomplicated order for less than 10 people. 
The portion sizes are tiny, even for the stuff off of the regular dinner menu. 

If you're craving thai in the annex, skip this place, there are a bunch more that aren't as mediocre as this place."}
{"text":"This place was packed, we came in to get a to go order. They had us sit down, and brought us \"complimentary\" salads. When we reminded them we were getting to go orders when they came to get our food order and they told us that they had to charge us for the salads they put in front of us after knowing we were getting to go... 
they also wouldn't let me get a half order of fried rice and chow mein. I HAD to get 2 full orders. 
Won't be back."}
{"text":"Good, solid Thai food conveniently located in the Annex.

This definitely isn't the best Thai in the city (that is Mengrai Gourmet Thai) but I don't think you're going to be greatly disappointed either.

The benefits of this place are: price, consistency, quantity and location.  Great for lunch, I've done several business meetings here as well as popping in for a quick bite.

If you want a special Thai dinner, it is definitely worth a trek to Mengrai Thai or the almost as good Golden Thai on Richmond St.

If I could do half stars I would give this 3 and a half since I also gave Golden 4, but the price and convenience probably make the 4 star tie a fair one."}
{"text":"I just came here on a whim while in Phoenix for COMICON. Food is alright. They are very quick with the food though and the place is very nice!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice for lunch. Lunch special includes salad, egg roll and entree all for around $10. The place gets really crowded around lunchtime, but turnover moves quickly. They are lacking on customer service. I asked for extra napkins twice which never came. It feels like they are rushing you out to make room for the next person. The service doesn't feel personal. Overall, good bang for your buck."}
{"text":"This place is really good for dinner and not so good for lunch despite having lunch special. I suspect they have different chef because even when we order our favorite meals they don't taste as good as they taste at dinner. The spices are not right, some flavors are lacking, and the texture is different. Trust me, I am not picky, but we've been to Thai Basil so many times that I know how everything tastes quite well. The decor of this place is amazing and the service is always friendly and quick. 
So, if you trust me and want to get a feel of the place, I really recommend Thai Basil Eggplants, Mango and Papaya Salad with Shrimps, Red Curry Duck, Baked Seafood in Pumpkin (my favorite!), and Crispy Basil Soft Shell Crab (my boyfriend's favorite). You can see the last two in the pictures below, sorry for partially eaten soft shell crab - my boyfriend was hungry and didn't want to wait until I take pictures :)"}
{"text":"I have eaten in the restaurant once which was great! So today was a lazy day and I had this delivered through(postmates). Im so glad I did! I loved everything I ordered and it all came in such generous helpings (worth the $$) and 1 entree can definitely be shared amongst others. Even though it was delivered it tasted exactly what I was hoping for! No mistakes or cut corners!

I ordered the 
-Musaman Curry Dinner (sweet coconut curry). I usually get mild spice (which was perfect) 
-Pineapple (yellow curry) fried rice...Amazing!!!
-Sweet purple sticky rice with sliced mango (to die for...hello breakfast)
Highly recommended!!! Seriously one of the best thai places in the area."}
{"text":"solid thai. not the greatest, not the worst. my main gripe really was i wasn't overwhelmed and flooded w the portion of food. 

however, i really enjoyed the super tight seating arrangement during the lunch rush. i felt like a cool new yorker, elbow to elbow with a stranger who was reading a newspaper. maybe i watch too much Mad Men, but this is the stuff that pleases me"}
{"text":"Good food. Good service. 

I've been going here for years. It used to be my go to place for thai when I was in college. I like its proximity to the school and the staff is really nice. If recommend the drunken noodles."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Thai place in Phoenix! My fiance and I are regulars here and have loved every dish we tried. High quality ingredients, fantastic taste, and the place is never super crowded. We always get really good service too. Seriously, this place is worth many visits. You can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"I always get the yellow curry at a Thai restaurant. This was no exception. Look, I like fast/cheap food as much as the next guy, but I like more depth of flavor in what I eat. The veggies don't really contribute anything to the dish. They just seem to be a space/stomach-filler. They needed to be steamed longer. Potatoes were still hard and starchy.

Check out Wild Thaiger. A little more expensive but definitely worth it."}
{"text":"I always either get the pad Thai, Thai hot and Thai iced tea. The lunch special is always gonna be under 10
Dollars so that's good. if you typically like your food spicy I recommend getting it Thai hot! Lunch specials start from 11 to 3 make sure you get there either after 12 cause of the lunch rush."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Thai Restaurants. The service at Thai Basil is great, friendly staff and food comes quickly. We came here for a family dinner and ordered Chicken & Beef Skewers, Pineapple Fried Rice with Shrimp, Papaya Salad, Chicken Pad Thai and one of their Curries.

The Skewers were nicely flavored and not dry at all. Came with a nutty dipping sauce.

The Green Papaya Salad was a highlight. I don't like papaya but this one was a really refreshing and light appetizer. It also had a fair amount of spice to give it a kick. 5/5

Pineapple fried rice was pretty standard but overall tasty. The rice had a mixture of pineapples, shrimp, ham and raisins. The raisins were pretty interesting but it worked for me 5/5

Chicken Pad Thai was pretty standard, it was a bit greasy to me but still tasted pretty good overall. 3.5/5

We've been coming here every once in a while and the food has always been consistent. Highly recommended for those who have never gone."}
{"text":"No thank you!! My husband and I just moved from Seattle where Thai Food is DELICIOUS! We ordered grub hub Thai Basil last night and it was pretty gross. Huge chunks of carrots and green onions thrown in instead of being thinly sliced in true Thai fashion. Also, very bland. We asked for \"medium spice\" since we wanted to be cautious it being our first time eating at Thai Basil. I kept biting into hard chunks of something...I'm thinking it was just some of the spices that weren't cooked down to soften up? Hmm...Either way I had to spit several bites out after biting down on something mysterious. The beef in my Pad-See-Ew was pretty fatty and the noodles were either way too cooked and kind of grainy or not cooked enough and still hard...My husbands Pad Thai tasted like spaghetti noodles with peanuts mashed up and mixed in. The noodles were way overdone and super mushy. Just not very good. I'm not sure how this place received as high of a rating as it did, but if you've ever had authentic Thai food, don't waste your money thinking that this place will even compare!"}
{"text":"Go here!  This is an amazing Thai restaurant that is now added to my list of great restaurants in the Phoenix area.   This is a  family owned and operated location where all work together very well, bringing you a lovely experience while dining. 

Our server let us know they will adjust the heat level on any dish and gave some help with what to order. 

The food was delicious!  We each ordered from different parts of the menu and shared all the food. The challenge was finding what was the favorite of the evening.  

Impossible.  Each dish was unbelievably well done, delivered hot and seasoned obviously, by the hand of a pro!

It was wonderful to see how well the entire staff worked together to make us feel welcomed and treated like family.  They didn't skip a beat, once the food was done it was brought to the table by all available staff.  Our server stopped by to see that we each received exactly what was ordered and if it was the correct heat level for our liking.  Drink refills were constant.

This restaurant does exactly the right thing.  Great food, fresh and hot from the kitchen very large portions and follow up to see if you need anything more. Thai Basil is very clean and nicely decorated.  As for earlier reviews, they do have a note on the menu that says groups of 5 or more will have a 15% additional charge.  We were so happy, we left more."}
{"text":"Fairly bland food for a Thai place, and they really hold back on the spice. Sure, most of their customers are weak sauce cockbiters who go to or work at ASU, and they don't want to burn their delicate tongues. But if I say Thai hot, spice the bastard up! Service is always great and it's an inexpensive spot for lunch, but I've always been pretty disappointed with the flavor."}
{"text":"great service good food! Fresh! Perfection. The staff was great and the sushi was amazing best I've tried in along time"}
{"text":"We Got here for dinner & we had pad Thai Tofu with crab fried rice. The pad Thai came out too sweet & the crab fried rice was so good. I ordered extra fresh chili in fish sauce to add on pad Thai. The place is small, cozy but the service is too good to be undeniable. I will come back to try more."}
{"text":"This place was eh. The plates of food very colorful and pretty but it was just blah. We got the Thai basil and the sweet and sour chicken. The Thai basil wasn't very juicy. But it was better than the sweet and sour which I didn't like at all. It was way too \"chickeny.\" It wasn't breaded and not very sweet either. We also got soft drinks and they were just cans. Cans for $1.50...really? I definitely expected Better based off the reviews but it's definitely an overrated place. Thai Rama is a lot better."}
{"text":"Excited by the idea of a Penang curry with chicken, I got something that looked like a cross of yellow and red curry with a squirt of white coconut milk on top.  Seriously?! The chicken slivers were well done and there wasn't a piece of veg in sight.  The taste, well, wasn't... A ginger lemon tea was nastiness in color and flavor and hadn't been freshly made, ever.  There's obviously no one in the kitchen who knows anything about Thai food.  Not surprisingly, the service was as bad as the food.  
Shame on Thai Basil.
Pass."}
{"text":"Horrible! The rice is overcooked, and there is no flavor to their food.  I have tried this place three times-- never again! How can Thai food be so bland?"}
{"text":"Definitely nothing compared to Suwanasak down the street, but a solid Thai take-out restaurant when you are in a bind. 

Portions are beyond generous so no complaints there, but I thought the pad thai noodles were a tad undercooked. Not a huge deal though when you can get in and out of there with a hot meal in under 10 minutes."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant.  Great curries, lovely salad dressing,  noodle dishes are wonderful.  Great service.  Very friendly."}
{"text":"This is probably our favorite Thai restaurant. We first tried a Thai basil In my wife's home town in Colorado, and were excited when we saw there was one close to our new home.
First is the food! They have sushi, Thai food, and Chinese options. As well as a \"bento\" style lunch in case you would like a little bit of each. Each meal has its own unique flavor, sauces and vegetables. They are not afraid to help you customize the order either. My wife loves the drunken noodles with extra basil. I enjoy the basil chicken and we both share a few sushi rolls. 
Sit at the bar and talk to the chef as he makes your order. It's fun, and after a little bit he will start to remember you. My favorites are the salmon skin hand roll, the red snapper, and the crunchy house roll. 

In the last 2 years that we have been here we have come at least once a month, and have only had one rough experience so far, and as soon as we mentioned it to our server, he replaced our meal and made it right. The service, and the people who work there help to make a place with great food even better. Highly recommend giving this place a try if you are in the mood for a great happy hour, great local sushi, heaping plates of noodles, and a great friendly atmosphere."}
{"text":"Love the coconut/pineapple fried rice! Real fruit chunks in it! Better than other thai food places in town!"}
{"text":"For all those times when a pile of meat and bread just won't do, I come here.

Cashew chicken wraps or eggrolls as an appetizer, with Tofu Thai Basil or the green curry are the stuff my dreams are made of. Make 'em extra spicy!

Ok, so maybe the vegetables are the same no matter what dish you get. But that's fine with me, I like them all!

The service has always been polite and attentive every time I've been here."}
{"text":"First time here. Also last.  Place wasn't very busy so you think the wait staff would have been more attentive. I had to get up and ask for chop sticks and my wife's tea. There was no call back to check on how the food was. The food was good."}
{"text":"Had lunch here today with 7 other persons.  I had the signature dish which I ordered with chicken.  I told the waitress that I wanted it mild like a  #1 hotness.  The tossed salad was served first, small, mostly lettuce but tasty. 
It was at lunch time which is quite busy due to all the office building nearby.  I ordered before everyone got there since I had to leave early for a previous appointment.  About 10 minutes later the others in my party ordered.  I couldn't believe it when they started bring out plates for the ones who ordered after me.  It couldn't have taken longer to prepare since another person ordered the same a I and got thers before me.
The food was good and just the right hint of spice.
It is a very, very small restaurant.  There is an outdoor patio for eating when the weather finally cools down in a couple of months.
Very reasonable lunch prices.  My bill with tax and tip was under $11.00"}
{"text":"I have always enjoyed the food here, and the service is always great. Last time the food for five of us came out in five minutes! The Panang Curry is solid!!!

I would like if they had a better alcoholic beverage selection, but hey, that's not why I go there!"}
{"text":"Great chicken wings. I got 4 medium, 4 bbq hot and 4 asian flair. The medium were the best and the bbq hot were delicious too. I liked the asian ones but probably won't get again. The kids got chicken strips with fries. The chicken was delicious and white!! The fries were fresh too!!! We usually go to the one in Mesa on brown... By far the one on Broadway/Dorsey is the best!!! The food was  way different!!"}
{"text":"I love Thai Basil! Their evil jungle noodle is super good! And I love that they actually make the food mild in request. Some other places seem to make it even hotter when you order mild but Thai Basil is spot on!"}
{"text":"Yumyumyum!   I have been here over 20 times and still they are GREAT!   I am still hooked on the combo appetizer as my entree.  The appetizer for me is TomKa soup with tofu.   I am so grateful that Thai Basil is still going strong!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is a hidden jewel. The food is exquisitely flavorful, and, as a family-owned business, the service was far more personable and catering than most other restaurants. Not only did the staff happily modify the Thai iced tea for me, in order to reduce its sweetness, but the co-owner even went so far as to offer me an additional tea from the remaining batch she had prepared. And, talk about being kid-friendly....we brought our nine month old, and the co-owner brought her a wrapped fortune cookie when she noticed our baby starting to get fussy. That cookie worked like a charm! 

By far, this is the best tasting Thai food we've tasted, not only in Las Vegas, but in comparison to the many Thai restaurants we've eaten at in Los Angeles. 

I would love to see this place featured in Diner's, Drive-in's, and Dives. Yes, it's that good. 

The only down side is that the restaurant does not have much natural lighting, but it is a quaintly decorated, authentic-looking, family-style environment.

So far, we absolutely love the shrimp pad Thai, shrimp friend rice, and shrimp Thai basil. The last, as I said before, is out of this world. Plus, white rice is included, with no extra charge. 

I do recommend this restaurant modernize its look and perhaps change its location, but the food definitely weighs out any negatives."}
{"text":"This place is a diamond in the rough!  I always have a great experience when I come.. The service is always good, and at least at lunch I have never had to wait for a seat!  Don't let that fool you though, it's great food, it is too bad they don't have a better location!  

Their lunch specials are great, around $7 a meal and more than enough food... but truly you MUST try the Panang Curry!!  It is my favorite curry in town!  Thai Spring Rolls are also a great appetizer!"}
{"text":"Thai Basil continues to impress me just as much as it did a year ago when I was last in town, and now I am also impressed by the staff and Thai Tea. The food is tasty and the servings are more than I can eat, which means leftovers to take home :)   I recently had salmon with my cashew nut dish and was thrilled with the choice. I ate the leftovers cold, and even they were good.  I am hoping to return to Phoenix or Tempe so I can enjoy more food from Thai Basil."}
{"text":"I gave this place another shot. This time I got much better TAKE OUT service and when arriving my food was ready to go. I ordered a Thai Ice Tea and I love that they wait until you arrive to make unlike some places who allow it to get watered down. 

Only reason I am leaving off one star is the Sushi  I tried really wasn't that great but what can you expect from a Sushi/Thai Fushion? I knew it was a toss up but I still LOVE their PAD THAI and will be returning often to get my fill."}
{"text":"Nonnie doesn't want Pizza!, my wife texted me.  OMG, this is driving me crazy!  We had a nice dinner planned with the MIL and BIL to visit with him before he shoots back to LA.  Haven't seen Tom in a few months, so it was nice catching up.  The text conversation continues....

They picked \"Thai Basil\" and dinner is at 6:00 - we will never make it in time!  Whatever, I said.  I've become familiar with the peculiarities of my in-laws and found the best approach is to just go along for the ride, no matter how bumpy.  We hit the 202 around five-thirty, expecting to get jammed up as we headed east.  Arriving at Rural road, it occurs to us that it's also another Grad night at ASU, and the right lane is backed up over the river.  Whatever, I spun past in the left lane.

Arriving at Thai Basil, I have to admit, my expectations were set on low.  My only previous experience with Thai Basil was take-away that was dry and oily and just weird stuff.  We were quickly escorted to a back, partitioned-off area and met the rest of the family.  The dining room is clean and modern, mostly tables and chairs with a tiny bar.  The area we were seated had more of an Asian feel, large, boxy booths with no backs and a thin cushion to sit on.  Iced tea for me and alcohol for the others was quickly brought out and everybody settled in.

For an appetizer, we had the crunchy vegetarian egg-roll.  Nicely sized, a bit larger than a fat, short cigar and tasty with a slightly pungent/sweet dipping sauce.  My daughter explained that you can order your food with a varying spice level 1-5, with 5 being hottest.  She also said that that heat level varied depending on where you were eating.  I played it safe and went with Spicy Noodles with Chicken at a level 3.  The wife had some sort of dish with giant scallops in it.  BIL had a seafood curry and I cannot remember the rest.  The meals arrived quickly, although not all at the same time, we had to wait a bit for the wife's dinner.

Spicy noodles was delicious.  Bite-sized chunks of chicken, mixed with a variety of crispy veggies - nicely done broccoli and other stuff.  Very tasty, I scarfed the plate.  Iced tea was fresh.  Wife loved her dish and boxed up about half of it to take home for a couple more meals.  

No complaints on the meals, portions were large and service was attentive without hovering.  Ambiance was really nice - quiet enough that we could actually have a conversation with each other.  Most importantly, Nonnie was happy, she got her family dinner with family togetherness."}
{"text":"I have heard AMAZING things about this place. We decided to go there and we sat down (there was 1 other table with people there) and we waited 15-20 mins for someone to just come to us and ask us what we wanted to drink. No matter how good the food, if the service is THAT bad, I'm sorry, I have to give it 3 stars. I would give it 2 stars but the food and prices were good."}
{"text":"Love this place. It's fast and convenient for hospital employees as you can order a head of time. Their Thai tea is to die for. Sometimes I go just for the tea!!  Staff is super friendly and always helpful when it comes to trying new things."}
{"text":"This restaurant offers large portions, quick service, and tasty ingredients. The indoor seating area is a little small, but they offer a large outdoor seating area."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that this place is outstanding. 

I'm relatively new to Thai, and this is a new restaurant. They opened where a previous restaurant closed. Looks like they totally remodeled. It looks fresh and clean inside. The staff and owners are way nice and friendly and attentive. 

I'm becoming a big fan of Thai food. Even though I haven't had it loads of times, I can tell you that this is probably the best I've ever had. I've eaten out enough to be able to say what's good at least, and Thai Basil is wicked good for sure. 

It's awesome that they deliver as Thai places normally don't, but a shame they don't deliver to my house because I live too far away. We're probably going to be getting takeout from here a bunch.

I had their signature dish with beef - it was amazing. I got medium spice which was perfect if not a little less spicy than I would've liked for most of the dish, but when I got to the end, it definitely started to kick in. I would start with medium unless you like things really hot. Mild for those who are less adventurous. We also got a coconut curry yellow chicken dish which was awesome as well. Their spring rolls and fresh rolls are both vegetarian and both in my top 10 of all time for any Asian restaurant... perhaps in my top 5. 

The portions were huge. We got 2 entrees and 2 appetizers for the two of us, and luckily my girlfriend's sister came over to help us eat it because there's no way the two of us could've even dented it by ourselves. There's enough food here for 3-4 people. I don't know if it works that way when you dine in, but I ordered mine to-go and there was so much food.

We got Thai iced tea as well, and it's easily the best I've ever had. 

Normally, I give it a couple of days or so before I write a review, but I'm sitting here having just finished eating - feeling content with a happy tummy and I just had to write it down. Anyway - I love this place. I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Quick service even when full up during lunch rush.   30 min start to finish.  

I had the Thai basil signature meal with chicken and a gluten free soy sauce.  

The food and service was great and they have plenty of GF options.  The meal also was light but filling."}
{"text":"Thai basil is our to-go takeout place. The food is pretty authentic-- it is owned/run by Thai people, unlike many Thai restaurants. While I'm not Thai, my family has lived in Thailand for a decade, and Thai Basil offers the best Thai food in Madison. Definitely call your order in ahead-- it can take 20 minutes to prepare on a busy night. The staff is always friendly and courteous, and the food is delicious! My only complaint is that they don't offer Massaman Curry."}
{"text":"Like the food and price.   I usually go there for lunch.   But there is only 1 person serving and she is quite rude.  Probably because she is overwhelmed.  I'm thinking twice about coming here for lunch again."}
{"text":"If I could somehow pour enough of the red curry to swim in it without being burned... I'd be the happiest girl in the world. This place is super affordable, super fast, friend and oh my God that red curry. I literally get the exact same thing every time I come (this is my 10th tkme) it's that good. Pad Thai is bomb as well. But seriously... Red curry.  :)"}
{"text":"Everything was thailicious. Ordered the pad tai and Panang curry. I couldn't stop eating.  I totally regretted that later, but at the time it was great!"}
{"text":"I ordered the chicken Pad Thai.  It was good but it fell flat in flavor. I should have requested lime wedges, cilantro, green onion and raw bean sprouts to brighten the whole dish.  I don't know why I didn't think of that as I was eating!  I also ordered it medium spicy which I thought was actually really tame. I wish that I had gotten it spicier. 

Service was great. 

The lunch prices and the quantity of food you received for lunch is an awesome deal. I'm pretty sure that Pad Thai was $7.95. 

By the time we left at 12:30 the place was packed. 

I'm sure I will be back!"}
{"text":"Came here a while ago for some dinner when I was craving some good Thai food. I was not disappointed. It was decently priced, and the portions were pretty big. I saw people leaving the back with take-out containers and getting into cars so I'm assuming that hey do delivery. The restaurant is very cute though if you want to go in. I wish I had taken pictures! They had some cheesy music playing, but I thought it was kind of funny. The food arrived and was excellent. The service was fast and the food had lots of flavor. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I wouldn't recommend this place to any one. My wife ordered crispy fried noodles...noodles not cooked! Son had chicken panang curry, bland and tasted like Lemon grass and not the traditional coconut milk after taste. I had the sesame seed chicken buento box. Salty! I would say the shrimp tempura was good. Also had sides of the Happy Hour rainbow and Alaska roll....fish was dry and rice had some hard pieces. It was 6:00 p.m. on Memorial Day, entirely empty,  and couldn't get a decent meal. I give an \"B\" for effort  but a \"D\" for taste. The waiter did stay on top of the water refills. Thanks for your efforts guys, but I think you need improvement on your taste."}
{"text":"Not bad for a 11 dollar per person meal.
The food isn't that spicy (even on medium)
Great food for its location"}
{"text":"Really great Thai food at a really great price! Green curry is one of the best I've ever had!! 5 stars for sure!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner a few nights ago and enjoyed every dish! From the Malaysian style vegetables to the Penang Curry. The dessert which was a tapioca cake was also really delicious, topped with cream and not too sweet. 

It's got a kick to it but very enjoyable nonetheless. Would come back again!"}
{"text":"Thai Basil is the best Thai food I've had in Arizona. I frequent the area regularly for work, and Thai basil is always the first lunch stop I go to. It's a smaller restaurant located in a small plaza, right across ASU. Service is fast and friendly, and the food is always amazing. I love the avocado spring rolls as an appetizer and the peanut curry for an entree. I always ask for a side of extra peanut sauce because it's so good. I usually get the curry at a 3 spicy level and it's perfect. It's not too spicy but still has a kick."}
{"text":"The Thai Tea here is bomb! So sweet & creamy. More creamy looking than the deep orange color. The young  female waitress here is hella cute too. :)"}
{"text":"I've had food from here twice. The first time my husband brought me back some and the second time was a couple of weeks ago when we stopped in here because we were starving. OMG I fell in love with the food again. I love Thai hot! My husband can't handle it, but I can! The owner was really nice too. I had my baby with us and she thought he was so cute and she took care of him while we ate. That was amazing. I kept looking back for my baby, but he was in good hands every one there loved him. I will go back to try other things from their menu. The only thing I'd wish they'd do is give refills. I don't know if they do, but I wish they did."}
{"text":"I have tried just about all of the Thai food places in town and this one is by far our favorite. The portions are large and the food is really delicious, We typically get the red curry and the panang curry. Really good stuff. We always have left overs.

Only tip, if you want it spicy, make sure you reiterate spicy as they tend to make it mild, even when you say, \"spicy.\" Best is to say \"Thai spicy.\"

I highly recommend."}
{"text":"I refuse to eat Thai anywhere else, which might be biased given that this was the first place I had ever tried Thai food. The waitress was very excited to introduce me to her cuisine, even discounted the appetizer. Positively in love with the green curry here. I have tried it at other places recently and it doesn't compare. They have an honest scale of heat measurement; my hunny prefers hot (made his brow sweat) and I enjoy mild- just enough to taste and not kill my tastebuds. Seating is quaint, not very private but nice ambience and well decorated. Good portions, fair pricing."}
{"text":"You have gotta taste the red and green curries. Out of the world! Good ambiance. Appetizers and drinks were average"}
{"text":"Huge mouthwatering portions ! Their Tom-Kha blew us away, it was spiced right & large. Pad pak topped off the experience 
Sunday eveniing and there plenty of people coming on to chow near close. 
Some Thai restaurants intentionally serve you small portions especially rice, different philosophy here. You will get your moneys worth.
Impressed!"}
{"text":"Fast and have lunch specials. It's clean and busy during lunch hour.. but the food is your typical thai food you will get through a chain.. nothing really stands out but they have your usual pad Thai to eggplant dish with rice.."}
{"text":"Food is amazing! Thai ice tea is so refreshing and cold. Service was fast and always helpful. Smiles and nice. Good portions great food."}
{"text":"This is the best Thai restaurant in Toronto. Nothing beats their Green Curry. End off the night with a mango tea, best dessert styled tea! Happy Eating"}
{"text":"Great food and jam packed at lunch.  Love the dressing they put on their salads.

Ordered the Signature Dish (Chicken Basil) and loved it.  Comes with the salad, white rice, and a mini-egg roll.

Service was excellent and food was prepared very quickly and came out hot.

They have one little oddity:  If one dish is ready before the others, they'll bring it out.  So most often the orders sort of trickle out to the table.  Doesn't bother me but I found it a bit strange."}
{"text":"This place is seriously not good. The noodles are dry and lack flavor. My friend got the pad-thai, not good either. Both tasted like dog food smells. If I could imagine how dog food tastes it probably tastes like the dishes they serve here. I don't know about the other dishes but any noodle dish is gross here. Couldn't even push myself to eat half. The staff was helpful and asked if we were okay and we just were straight up with them that the food was not appetizing. There wasn't a solution to the problem so we just got the check and got up out of there."}
{"text":"First time visit....I had two things on the menu.

- the chicken satay appetizer
- pad thai

the chicken was just ok, but it the peanut sauce had the flavor and consistency of peanut butter heated in oil.

As for the pad thai, i'm not one of those pad thai snobs who went to phuket on vacation and now no Americanized pad thai is good enough for me. having said that, i was not impressed at all with the pad thai here. a big pile of noodles with little or no flavor except a sweetness that had a hint of the sauteed peanut butter from the chicken satay. the chicken was flavorless clumps as were the tofu. despite the bean sprouts, oily peanut clumps, etc, it was devoid of a variety in texture. I usually enjoy the the cool bean sprouts, the crunch of ground peanuts, the way the egg and tofu saturate with flavor, the acid and spice of lime/tamarind/pepper. ALL OF THIS was missing from this meal.

$19 later, very disappointed since this was the highest rated thai restaurant in the area. despite this, will not be going back.

Pad Thai is supposed to be the signature thai dish. I mean, it has thai in the name. if you can't do that right........?"}
{"text":"This place is okay, I have gone a couple of times, but the last time I went the food was horrible and the service was really bad.  They were not even that busy.  If I had to choose between thai basil and thai rama which is just around the corner I would travel a little further and go to thai rama.  I live right behind thai basil and I wont eat there.  the price for the food is not worth it."}
{"text":"This place is just ok. Decor is nice and portions big but food is nothing special."}
{"text":"Meh - the pad thai was REALLY bland and dry.  I didn't dine in, so I can't say much about the service, but I did wait inside while my order was being made - it was a little stinky - like mildew stinky?  I dunno.  The table I waited at was a little dirty.  The food was alright, but not even average.  With so many good thai options in the city, I won't likely return."}
{"text":"The service here is super super fast - like so fast I'm pretty sure they asked me what I wanted to drink before I even sat down. Service like this can be appreciated downtown, so I have no complaints. I think spending 1.5 hours at lunch when you need to get back to work and on the clock can be infuriating - so I really liked how fast we were in and out.
I got the Chicken Pad Thai lunch - I ordered it hot but it's not insanely hot. It was cheap too maybe somewhere in the $7.50 range and comes with a free house salad. Also, a free egg roll with the meal. 
It's in the same plaza right next to Starbucks and Jimmy Johns. Easy parking and positive experience."}
{"text":"Nothing fancy here, but if you work in the area, these people are all business. They will have you in and out in 30 minutes, which is impressive for a sit-down restaurant. You have a salad with a fantastic lime basil house dressing in front of you within 60 seconds. They selection and price are very good, in my opinion. Not the most authentic Thai, but I enjoy it. You can even buy their house salad dressing by the bottle to take home."}
{"text":"I love Thai food. I'm from New York, and I was craving some curry chicken fried rice. I found this location and they didn't disappoint. I enjoyed every bite. I will definitely return for different choices soon."}
{"text":"Huge portions and a great price too.  My sister (her first time trying Thai) had the beef pad see ew and I had the chicken pad Thai.  The noodles in both were cooked to perfection with a great slight chewiness and density.  The toppings were aesthetically pleasing and there weren't fillers.  Definitely umami.  The staff definitely knows their regulars.  I am not so I didn't have as much of a friendly greeting.  The food more than made up for a great lunch and leftovers."}
{"text":"This is by far THE BEST Thai restaurant in Central Phoenix. I have eaten takeout from almost all Phoenix Thai restaurants and Thai Basil is superior in so many ways. The curries are thick, full if flavor, and yummy veggies, and easily serve two people. The thom yum soup is rich in flavor with the authentic fish/shrimp stock taste that can be hard to find. True authentic Thai food and super affordable. It's kind of a he in the wall, so if you're looking for a fancy place, maybe not your first choice. I do take out, and drive extra bc of the AMAZING consistently good food and price!"}
{"text":"The spring rolls are full of iceburg lettuce, I would avoid ordering them. The green curry was tasty though. Overall, I was a bit disappointed with or experience."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to eat, ever, in the history of the entire world. The curry is heavenly, the soup amazing and the staff sweet and friendly.  Keep it up Thai Basil, you rock."}
{"text":"AUTHENTIC & tasteful! Friendly service, frequent refills, will go out of their way to accomedate! Always get the yellow curry (amazing) & traditional pad thai (equally amazing) and to top it off- fried banana with honey & ice cream. HEAVEN IS REALLY A PLACE ON EARTH!"}
{"text":"I had dinner here twice, and both times I was favorably impressed. Thai Basil is on the eastern edge of the university. It's small, but comfortable. Service was excellent and the staff was friendly and responsive.

Dinner #1 was chicken satay skewers as an appetizer and chicken pad thai as the entree. The appetizer was very good, especially wiath a Sapporo beer (hard to find, in my experience.) I ordered the pad thai with medium spice and it was just right---my lips were burning a bit but the heat didn't overwhelm the flavors. The entree was huge---I got though only 2/3 of it and I was hungry.

Dinner #2 was lemon grass soup with chicken. Again, I ordered medium spice and it was just right for me. The soup was excellent, although I had to pick out pieces of lemon grass.

Overall, a good value and very good food. If I'm in the area I'll make a point of visiting."}
{"text":"My friends and I joke that the Pad Thai has crack in it. But that might be the case. I have yet to try a Pad Thai dish that surpasses the one at Thai Basil. I literally eat here once a week (or more) and the portions are large enough to take home to have another meal later. Consistently delicious! Vegan/vegetarian friendly :)."}
{"text":"This may not be the best Thai food but it's good and it delivers. I like the pad Thai and my boyfriend likes the dumplings and the Thai rice with chicken. They do have vegetarian options and will replace any meat with tofu if asked."}
{"text":"Drove by a thousand times. Stopped in today, and most likely tomorrow.

Never have been to a Thai Basil before, which is strange because I do absolutely love Thai cuisine. Stopped in last night with my girlfriend for a dinner break from studying. Just wanted a quick bite to eat and got much more.

The menu was large and honestly hard to choose from. After several minutes trying to decide on a choice, I struck up a conversation with a friendly patron to my right and she recommended the egg noodle stir fry with chicken. Trusting her, I ordered it and within 5 minutes I had a large, hot plate of it sitting in front of me. At the same time my girl landed herself some fried sweet potato skins with a delicious dipping sauce. 

Both of use enjoyed every last bite of the meal. We topped off the dinner break with what else for a college student on a study break?!? The Thai Coffee. It is served iced and taste somewhere between chocolate milk, and burned coffee. Sound kinda weird? well it kinda took me by surprise, but we enjoyed every last drop. 

Since this wonderful, new found Basil explosion is so close and I will definitely be back soon. Maybe tomorrow...

Btw... I heart basil"}
{"text":"Lunch combo special comes with \"Tong Yum\" Thai Spicy & Sour Soup, Vegetarian spring roll for appetizer while waiting for the mains, the soup was a bit too spicy but the spring roll was crunchy and not too oily
.
\"Gaeng Kiew Wan\" Thai Green Curry with Jasmine Rice - mid level spiciness that goes really well with the rice and the curry itself wasn't too sweet and the chicken wasn't dry at all, portion is good for lunch too!
.
\"Kor Moo Yang\" Thai BBQ Pork with Jasmine Rice - I didn't expect them to actually barbecue the pork with such a cheap price but the pork is chewy and I think they used pork cheek meat so there's more to chew than pork chop or other parts of a pig, the sauce that comes with the pork was a bit sour but for me it was perfect with the BBQ pork!
.
Overall, they have really good deal for Thai food especially during lunch hours! Don't expect it to have quality like pai tho..ohh, one thing forgot to mention is that their rice was shaped in star-shape so kinda cute for them to do it"}
{"text":"I had dinner with a couple girlfriends who have been here several times and loved it. Typical Thai food. It was decent. I ordered the papaya salad and spring rolls. It was decent nothing special, I wasn't a fan of the papaya..should have stuck with the tried and true mango salad. The spring rolls were good though. 

My girlfriends had the Chicken Pad Thai and Chicken shrimp to go. They enjoyed their meals, they gave their meals a 4.5/5. I felt it was more of 2/5 so I gave them an overall score of 3/5. The one nice thing was they were really quick with their service."}
{"text":"The first advice I will give you is never ever tell them to give you theyre best shot on the spice level for the curry. I made that mistake and this was so hot 4 bites in i had to literally stop. My enitre insides and colon burned for the next 2 days. Aside from me being an idiot, the food has always been amazing every other time ive ordered normal food. The curry is creamy and has alot kf flavor and the pad thai is really saucy and has a good meat portion and good amount peanuts. Just awesome, love this place you really need to go"}
{"text":"The Thai food here is palatable and the price is reasonable. Yellow curry with beef is my favorite dish. The Thai ice tea is tasty. The waiters are nice and efficient. Now I like Thai food very much."}
{"text":"Yummy Thai!

Looking for dinner in the area, we would have this place had it not been for Yelp! and the positive reviews.  After locating it next to the Starbucks, we parked and piled in.  

Service was fast and polite.  There's a good menu full of options that should cover every palate.  The patio setting on a nice night is not pretty.  But, you're there for the food/service and not the sights, right?

The meal:
1) Apps: Tom yum soup and chicken satay were tasty.  I'm not usually a fan of peanut sauces, but theirs rocked.  
2) The salad and dressing also received compliments around the table. 
3) Yellow Curry with chicken, Siamese Salad, Beef Thai Basil, and fried rice (for our little girl) all made our group happy.  Flavors are excellent, meats were tender and flavorful, and the portion sizes were perfect.

We'll definitely visit this place, again."}
{"text":"Wow! Went their on a whim and was pleasantly surprised to enjoy some of the best Thai food I've had in years. The atmosphere was relaxing, the staff polite and attentive. Hope you enjoy it as much as I did."}
{"text":"Neighborhood takeout Thai place that's a convenient location for me, with your usual Thai restaurant standards. Let's call this more of a 3.5-star review. 

Madison tends to have lots of restaurants in certain genres that tend to also have similar quality. For example, there's who knows how many Indian places with lunch buffets, junk food takeout Chinese joints, half decent sushi places, etc. Some are better than others but there's not a lot to separate them. That also applies with the Thai restaurants around town. They all make a lot of the same dishes and some do it a little better than others. 

Within that group of mostly-similar Thai places, I'd say Thai Basil is pretty good, and is relatively cheap. Not exactly super exciting and different if you've had lots of Thai food, but they do the standards reasonably well. 

I will say that sometimes the curries seem to be a lot of sauce with not a ton of meat and veggies, but overall I have no major complaints."}
{"text":"I called to place an order and the person who answered hung up on me. So, I called back and he seemed annoyed that I called back, but still took my order: one order of Seafood Fried Rice for carry-out.  I gave two stars because the food was ready in 15 minutes as promised, however, the calamari was extremely rubbery (over-cooked) the scallops were slightly undercooked, the dish as a whole was very bland, and service with a smile goes a long way. I guess to a college student it probably tastes great, however, family of foodies will never eat here again. 
Honestly, I think we're gonna just avoid the ASU area all together."}
{"text":"This place can do no wrong.
The Evil Jungle noodles with the red curry sauce is to die for!"}
{"text":"Two stars seems harsh but truthfully, I have experienced better. Much better. Whenever I get Thai food I always get the green curry. Always. If I'd eaten the green curry from Thai Basil without knowing what it was I sincerely doubt I'd have ever guessed it was green curry. I'm not sure I'd have even guessed curry of any kind. Flavorless curry is certainly an achievement, but not one I'm keen to have again.

That said, the staff were super friendly and my order was ready super fast."}
{"text":"Food is always great, even as take-out. Always friendly service at this location also. All of their curries are amazing"}
{"text":"3.5 

It's definitely not a bad choice. The service is really fast and friendly. 

The food itself is ok. The vegetarian pad Thai I had was fresh, nice crunch from the peanuts, and great tang from the lime juice sprinkled on top. 

The pricing is also comparable to other restaurants in the area. 

I'll definitely visit again."}
{"text":"Worst Thai food I've ever had !!!!! Worst flavors.  A lot of the food wasn't even Thai.  If you want decent Thai food go across the way to amazing Thai.  I will never be going back to Thai basil."}
{"text":"Love this place! I come here with a friend of mine every time we meet. The food is great and the staff is very friendly and professional. They have whole coconuts for drinking and this amazing black bean pudding for dessert.
The restaurant is also very relaxed and comfortable yet classy, and they never make you feel as if you are staying to long, so it's a great place to catch up with friends you haven't seen in a while."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery via DoorDash the sushi combo lunch that comes with miso soup. 
No soup included with the delivery. 
** they also add wasabi with their sushi so those who don't like wasabi (like me) make sure to specify \"no wasabi\"
Most places only  have wasabi on the side, not already added in the sushi. I could not eat it so can not comment on the quality of the sushi"}
{"text":"First I have to say I appreciate a mom & pop asian place that is not cheesey.  We get take out, but you want into the restaurant and think \"wow, we really should have a date night here.\"  It's clean, modern, minimalist and I thank them for that.  

Second, it's good.  Best pad thai in Phx if you ask me and I have had a lot of them.  My boyfriend also gets the pork sweet and sour and loves it.  The only issue we had is not having the option to get fried rice with his order, they said we'd have to order it for $8.95.  No biggie, but we opted not to order it.  Good prices.  Def must if you're in Tempe."}
{"text":"3.8/5

Great food, atmosphere, and service. If you're looking for authentic Thai food this is the place to go. Portions were reasonable, but a little pricey. 

Would recommend the crispy basil soft shell crab and the basil chili fried rice."}
{"text":"This is one of those Thai places that I really should get to more often.  Whenever I go, it's always relaxing and I get great service.  The curry dishes are superb, I recommend the yellow curry as the best!  As an added bonus, the parking is easier here than the one on Rural Road, especially at the popular dinner hours.  I have been wanting to try the Thai iced tea here, so I'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"Haven't been here for awhile. Went for lunch today and had two of their lunch specials. Their pad see ew, taste is still there but they use standard Asian rice noodle not the thick flat ones anymore. 

Green Curry rice was cold and spring rolls were cold. 

Not sure if chef changed in past couple of months but not planning to come back..."}
{"text":"My Thai roommate: \"It gets my stamp of approval!\"

What impressed us was that the waitress was actually from Thailand! It definitely made my roommate reminisce about the delicious items she had in Thailand. 

We both shared the Pad Thai and Yellow Curry. Their yellow curry is my roommate's favorite curry. I usually love getting the Red Curry or Panang Curry. We still finished the yellow curry until there was nothing left! Next time I'll have to try their Green Curry. I was impressed with their size of Thai Iced tea! There was so much left over, we took a to-go-box home. 

Tip: Come with a bigger group of people so you can select more dishes and eat different types of food! Overall it's a great place to eat. Excellent customer service."}
{"text":"Get the green curry and don't look back. It's a strong move. I love how healthy this place can be and the food is not processed. I feel like this is how home cooking would be if my mom was Asian. A little expensive though."}
{"text":"Nope...not what I expected from a Thai place!!! I mean if you are into the bland and sorrowful this is your place. If you have never been outside the US and want to impress Suzy Q with some foreign delicacy, this is your place. If you want to eat real thai food...go elsewhere. You don't believe me, i wrote this for a reason! The Pad Thai was disgusting and the soup they gave me was no more than just hot water with carrots, celery, and cilantro mixed in. No traditional Thai spices available. Ill NEVER return!"}
{"text":"Thai Basil is a culinary gem, tucked away in a little nondescript strip mall on Baseline close to the intersection at Alma School. Don't let it's exterior fool you! Inside, the decor is spare and modern with a cool Asian vibe, which beautifully sets off the real star of the show: their basil-infused menu.

I was an avid fan of their predecessor, Palee's Crown, and was heartbroken when it closed down a few months ago. Grudgingly, I visited the new place and expected to be less than impressed (I'm picky about my Thai). Was I surprised! The food is as good if not better than Palee's, plus I really like the fresh decor. My favorite dish is the tangy Eggplant with pork (I order it \"mild\" and get chili sauce on the side) and my daughter can't get enough of the Peanut Curry with pork (also known as Panang Curry). I've tried other things as well and I've liked them all. Consistently great food! Plus, the owners and staff are friendly and attentive, which is very important to me.

Hope you'll give this restaurant a shot. I want them to be successful so I can continue to enjoy their mouth-watering fare for years to come. After you visit, I think you will too!"}
{"text":"Does anyone remember when Mill Avenue used to be a fun place to hang out? Yeah, neither do I, but I've been told from the horse's mouth (sorry to call you a horse, Mr. Man) that it used to be a hip and happening place with plenty of small, custom shops and dives instead of the now ubiquitous mega-corporate whorebaggery. Luckily, you have only to travel a little bit further west on University to steep yourself in that old school neighborhood feel. 

Thai Basil gets big stars for being one of these homey neighborhood joints. Along with El Pollo, Tops, Tempe Bicycle, HTC, Otto's, Headquarters, Buffalo, etc., this locally owned restaurant has consistently provided inviting ambiance, wonderful service and delicious food for pennies compared to anything on Mill.

I just finished my leftover red curry chicken just before I wrote this, and it was every bit as savory and rich as it was last night (just make sure to put the leftover sticky rice in a plastic bag or it'll get crusty). The fragrance and flavor of all their curries (red, green, yellow, and peanut) is if not unmatched, pretty damn close to the best offered at any Thai place I've dined. Thick, al dente, crinkle cut carrots, bamboo shoots, green beans, broccoli, zucchini, red and green peppers with tender choice of meat afloat in savory coconut milk that suspends the perfect amount of earthy spice and hot chili to ensure that the meal dances on your taste buds.

My favorite dishes aside, just about everything on the menu at Thai Basil has proved to be exemplary. The Thai Basil is their signature dish and certainly doesn't skimp on its namesake fresh basil and thick flavorful sauce. The Pad Thai is sure as hell better than what's offered at Bamboo Club, with ample crushed peanuts and noodles that don't turn into a puddle of goo once the dish cools. The Garlic Pork has a lighter sauce that still manages all the fragrance and flavor of its more syrupy counterparts. The papaya salad is crisp, citric, sweet and spicy, an excellent accompaniment to a rich meal. Or try the crispy spring rolls that manage to be filling despite their humble size. The chicken satay with peanut sauce is also a very good choice for picky eaters (or kiddos), although they'll truly miss out on the more complex flavors of this amazing food. 

Thai Basil is a fairly small restaurant with dark wood tables that are all very closely spaced to ensure the maximum number of people can be seated. There is booth seating along the back and stretching the length of one side, while high tables and chairs are located in the windowed area facing Farmer. The decorations are sparse but complement the overall Asian feel, with bamboo accessories, knick knacks and family pictures decorating the walls. The richly colored, metallic embroidered skirt/pants worn by the waitresses are also for sale if you're looking for something special to spice up your wardrobe.

Despite its small size, I've never experienced the long wait times that others have when I come here. The servers have always been very attentive and quick to refill a glass or take my order, and are honest with their opinion when asked what they enjoy on the menu. I don't generally go here on busy nights though, and the hours I attend are either early or late evening, so maybe I avoid the hectic rush, because the kitchen is pretty small. At least you know you're getting fresh Thai from the folks who know it best as a result. If you don't have a lot of time to wait and just want a quick dinner, it's also possible to phone in your order or walk in, order, visit the shops around the restaurant and return in ten minutes to a piping hot order.

Try out the lunch specials! They're a great deal and they get you in and out within the hour. Although this is the one time of the day I've been when it's a bit on the slow side, since the entire restaurant is always packed. But the crowd is oddly well staggered since I've never seen anyone waiting for a table. For about eight bucks you get a small salad with tangy sweet vinaigrette, a spring roll with sweet and sour sauce, and your choice of dish with a ball of rice on the side. It's usually enough so I have one extra lunch leftover, compared to the two lunches I usually have with the regular dinner dishes. 

One thing I've noticed over time is that their \"hot\" really isn't that hot, so if you like it spicy, make sure to specify. 

Thai Basil is a comfortable neighborhood restaurant that attracts the type of customers Mill Avenue only wishes it could, loyal ones. As Mill whores itself out to the highest corporate bidder, I envision the property owners diving through coins like Scrooge McDuck and doing their best impression of Mr. Burns'. But the obscene retail rent checks signed reflects the boost in product price and the blandness of corporate hegemony. It's a relief for this starving-but-no-longer-student to support a local eatery by driving just a little west of that circus."}
{"text":"Great food, great service. Food is fresh and great flavor. We had the Thai basil chicken, sesame chicken, lettuce wraps and sushi. Even the Thai coffee was delicious. Reasonable prices... Don't listen to the 3 star reviews."}
{"text":"Tasty, friendly neighborhood Thai place.

Moved out of Tempe last year, but this was always my go to spot for thai, and when I come to tempe I like to visit. The food is always good - has a very fresh flavor, well spiced, and nicely prepared. They're happy to accommodate dine in or take out (which is fun, especially because the bar next door doesn't mind if you eat Thai while drinking craft beer :D), and the staff has always been very friendly and attentive to me and my friends. Brought a friend who is originally from China but has traveled to Thailand and he enjoyed the food as being fairly \"authentic\" and really liked the dessert with mango and the purple sticky rice. For me it's all about the Silver Noodles w/ Chicken MMmm! *Though make sure you clarify if you want the soup or the plate dish as they have mixed my order up before*

Also, if you like it spicy, HOLY MOLY can they do spicy here! Weak-tongues beware, don't ask for that highest level unless you got a big pitcher of thai iced tea ready to go!

Compared to other Thai restaurants I have tried nearby (thai elephant, etc.) I think Thai Basil has better food, nicer staff, and better prices. It's not quite as \"classy\" since it's a pretty simple place, the food/plating is taste over ostentatious presentations, and they're usually rocking some jazzy covers of pop tunes on the stereo by the front door, but I haven't ever considered myself a classy guy :P 

4 stars, totally recommend!"}
{"text":"Their Pad See Ew has literally no flavor at all. 
It's my favorite dish at every Thai restaurant I eat at (I eat Thai food like 5 times a week).
Darn it."}
{"text":"Thai restaurants are the only ones who seem like they all have the word Thai in their name. Thai Lana, Thai Elephant, and Thai Basil. Mmmmm I like Thai food. I just said Thai 7 times in the introduction paragraph of this review. Hmmmm

For lunch, this is a bustling place with business people eager to grab a lunch special with soup, egg roll, rice, and main dish. They are well staffed and extremely quick at lunch time. At dinner, it's a quiet place with an eclectic clientele. They do a nice take out business and it shows because the kitchen takes a little while at night. 

Our service has been spot on perfect on every visit... rare that I don't find something to bitch about service wise because I'm so ridiculously picky, but these guys are really good. They have a beautiful presentation with every dish that allows for it (some Thai dishes by nature are hideous,) and the decor and restaurant are squeaky clean. So far, I have to say this place is a fantastic choice. 

Then we get to the food. Park Central Mall needs a place that serves truly awesome food, cuz their current lineup aint it. Don't get me wrong, Thai Basil's food doesn't weigh you down, isn't full of grease, and is well prepared, but every time I go in there all I can think of is how utterly bland it is. I started asking for extra spicy after a while, but it still comes out bland, and I don't order bland dishes! Garlic Chicken, Pad Thai, Pepper Chicken, etc. All lacking spice or the flavor they should have. Albiet, the food tastes good, just when I go out for Thai, I am looking for some spicy food...

All in all, the lack of spice isn't enough to keep me away... it's just enough to keep from running back. If they would get it right then this would be a great place... I understand your whitey white clientele might not want spicy, but at least offer a choice and take people seriously when they say they want their spicy dish to be spicy."}
{"text":"Ordered the chicken paht thai to go, delicious! Chicken and noodles with a wonderful taste. I like that they did not use Styrofoam, one of my pet peeves. I'll be back Thai Basil!"}
{"text":"The dishes had the perfect amount of spice and the flavours were great. The mango sticky rice is great, but they didnt have the sago when we went but it was still delicious"}
{"text":"Thai Basil was my first experience eating Thai food... I must say, I really loved it. There is absolutely zero atmosphere, and there seems to be very little seating... but to be honest I'd still happily go and eat there rather than have take-out, it's just that good! Now all I have to do is make friends who actually like Thai, since all of mine apparently don't."}
{"text":"Love this place and it's food.  Have eaten here many times with husband and friends.  This time brought young children and they loved it too.  Green curry will bring you to tears...literally.  Eggplant with minced pork....yum.  Soups are delicious and come in varying degrees of hotness.  Mostly a young college crowd but all ages represented."}
{"text":"I was treating my mom to dinner and she wanted Thai food. I searched on Yelp and there was so many good reviews about this place that we NEEDED to try it out. The restaurant is located in a very busy plaza, it's almost impossible to find parking! There are so many other restaurants in the plaza! 

When we walked in, we were immediately greeted. The host cleared the table, cleaned it and sat us down. They offer many things on the menu. I got the khao soi with beef brisket and my mother got the pad sew with the shrimp. For apps, I got the fancy long shrimp spring rolls. 

1.) Khao Soi - was soooooooo gooood. I asked for Thai spicy, was not spicy at all. I dumped in all of the chilli oil that they brought on the side. Wished there was fresh chilli peppers and wished that my curry was spicier. Other than that, the Khao soi was very good and flavorful. Tastes even better as left overs with fresh chilli peppers =))))))))!!! 

2.) Pad Sew - my mom always plays it safe. I was surprised that they did not offer the pad sew with beef. My mom finished her dish, when I tried it, it was also not Thai Spicy as we requested. I didn't like the pad sew and found it a bit too salty but my mom loved it! 

3.) Fried shrimp spring rolls - do not get. I ate 3 of the four, there was absolutely no shrimp. I dissected the third roll and there was no shrimp. That was my only disappointment, it was just a fried wrap phylo wrap.. if that is what you're in to, do get it but if you're expecting shrimp, get something else because you will not find any evidence of those sea critters anywhere!

Overall, I would come again with my boyfriend. I was bought on the khao soi and so happy that I don't have to drive all the way downtown for it. The prices are very decent and the service was great. I love the atmosphere of the restaurant and the only complaint I had was those friend shrimp rolls that had no shrimp. I should have listened to the other yelpers who had the same complaint about them but my hungry-shrimp-craving stomach was yearning for it! I can't wait to try their curries! 

Happy Eating YELPERS! =)"}
{"text":"Food is not great but okay. Found long hair in my food. Told the manager quietly but they asked to make another one. At that point I'd lost my appetite so I said No thank you. They brought me the check and paid in full. I don't care about paying but they should have at least offered to take care of the check or even a dessert or something. I was going to say no to the dessert and I actually would've thanked them for being nice and paid.
Oh well, thats it for me here"}
{"text":"Great place. Went there to dine in once, and had take out/deliver once. Love the green curry! Also tried their Garlic Shrimp and one of their fried noodle dishes. All tasted good. Nice decor at the restaurant. Their delivery person was quick! Some of us had a few (a list actually) of food restrictions and they were able to accommodate for them all.  :)"}
{"text":"This place is great for a quick eat in with great lunch menu pricing! Unlike many other places where lunch ends by 3pm; their lunch menu lasts till 5 pm! Super stellar. I find this place great for a decent meal for a decent price. The one down fall with this restaurant hence 3 stars over 4 is solely the fact that I find a big difference in quality of taste with takeout/delivery versus eating in. So I'd suggest eating in with this place. Makes a huge difference... 
Otherwise restaurant decor is nice; the staff are very friendly and attentive and always accomodating. I've been here tons of times as it is well priced esp. for Richmond Hill. 

Overall:
Great restaurant to eat in at... Don't get lazy and get delivery or takeout :P"}
{"text":"Food is good. Service lacks. Host was rude. Table was not set. Waited 15 minutes for table greet. Food was served with no utensils, napkins or side plates. Table of four beside us also had to flag server down to place order after waiting about 20 minutes with no table greet. Should have asked for 100% of tip to go to the culinary team, as our section server lacks hospitality training."}
{"text":"Really good Thai food! I've been trying to dine/get to-go options from places close to my condo, and Thai Basil was next on my list. I decided to drive up and order carry-out since I'd been running errands and just wanted to be home with food. 

There were a few occupied tables which surprised me for 4PM on a Saturday, but the busyness did not delay my order [note their good hours!]. I was welcomed by all of the gals working and given a menu, as well as giving a note about their of-the-day dinner specials. My go-to for any new Thai restaurant is Pad Thai not spicy [normally 0 or 1], to figure out their hotness scale. The cashier noted it would probably take 15-20 minutes or so for my meal, but when the bag was brought out I noted it had only been like 10 minutes!

Got home and dove in- Pad Thai was delicious and not terribly spicy. Couldn't hardly finish my meal since there was so much food they gave me. Definitely worth a return trip soon to try something else a little spicier!"}
{"text":"Mediocre food. Green curry was basically sugar water with creepy curry coloring, did not taste good at all. 
Fresh Roll with chick has just tiny portion of chicken in it and they charge this item for 7.50 for three pieces, not worth it at all. 
Ordered go to, but there was no paper/plastic plates.

Would not recommend it at all."}
{"text":"If I had not tried the drunken noodles dish, this place would've gotten 4 stars from me. I've always got the same thing whenever I come to Thai Basil and loved my signature dish. My better half, on the other hand, gets something different every time (pho, the Thai basil dish, a bento box, chow mein, etc.). He's never completely happy with his meals here, so that's another reason for the three star rating. Out of everything he's ordered, he likes the Thai Basil Chicken dish best! 

THAI BASIL TOFU ($8.59): Love this dish. This is my regular order. You can't go wrong since it's the namesake of the restaurant, right? I like the veggies in the dish and the texture of the tofu. The spiciness level is perfect and the portion is plentiful. I love how the rice comes in a pyramid shape. 4/5 

DRUNKEN NOODLES ($8.99): I ordered this dish on my most recent visit. Very bland and I didn't like the way to tofu was cooked. I won't order this again. 2/5

SERVICE: The staff is quiet but attentive. 3/5

VIBE: I like the feng shui going on in here. The restaurant is cloaked in shades of greens with bamboo accents. 

Worth a Return Visit?
Yes, but only for their lunch specials where I can get a spring roll with my Thai Basil Tofu dish for $7. 95! Go elsewhere for drunken noodles.

{"text":"Was here last night, dont know if its just me but usually when you walk into a sushi/thai place you get a welcome from some one in a corner or from behind the sushi bar, but not here. No one came to seat us and there was no sign so we just grabbed a seat. Everything else like server etc was ok. In regards to the food itself, we didnt like it at all..Thai foods known for its authentic flavor and spices.. This place want good. Honestly theirs better tasting thai food in Vegas...."}
{"text":"Great food. Super fast service. They are always friendly. Prices are awesome. Food can be spicy! Medium is actually pretty hot."}
{"text":"The location of this Thai Basil is in Richmond Hill.  I used to live in this area and love to frequently visit Thai Basil. They have fantastic lunch specials where you get a soup or spring roll and a entree for $10.  I haven't been here in 3 years so I was excited when I was in the area and decided to order take out.  I ordered the beef Panang red curry and shrimp Pad Thai.  I went to pick it up and asked for hot sauce with my order and was told the first one is free but they would have to charge if I wanted extra hot sauce which I found strange since my dinner order was quite pricey at $36 for 2 dishes.  Odd that they would nickel and dime you for hot sauce.  Was not impressed with that.  Got home and was excited to eat my food.  They didn't package it well the curry was coming out of the packaging.  The Pai Thai I thought was a little lumpy all the noodles were stuck together.  The shrimps were so small for the price I paid for. Also it tasted bland and dry.  The Panang red beef curry was chunky and the sauce was so thick.  Also the authentic Thai curry dishes usually have eggplants and some peppers.  This dish I felt like they just threw in chunks of beef and chunks of broccoli and mix it up.  It was ok.  Not the best.  I was very disappointed.  The quality went downhill since I've been there 3 years ago.  Which made sense as to why the restaurant was close to empty when I went at dinner time to pick up my order.  After today I would not be coming back again."}
{"text":"This restaurant was bustling on a weekday night! The ambiance was cozy, but loud at the same time. We were fit into one of the small 2-seaters elbow-to-elbow with another table, yet we felt like it was enough space to enjoy the meal. 

The vegetable spring rolls were good, the Tom Yum Kha was excellent, while the chili fried rice was disappointing. Not that the fried rice was bad, but it tasted like the sauce was poured into the rice and mixed at the end, rather than cooking through the flavor. I'll definitely return for the soup though!

Don't miss the refreshing cocktails (mine was something with mango, and it was delicious)."}
{"text":"Thai Basil is a nice looking restaurant in the heart of the Annex.  The menu is very extensive. However, when it comes to execution, the food is just ordinary, probably below your average Thai food.  

The vegetarian fresh Thai Cold Rolls ($5.95) were disappointing. They were lacking any flavour and were missing the nice accents you usually find, like fresh mint. They came with a thimble-sized serving of dipping sauce.

The Tom Yum soup was very sweet, lacking in heat or other flavours.  It was also expensive at $7.95 for an individual portion.

The green mango salad was actually ripe yellow mango. It was sweet, with sweet sauce. It was missing any brininess, or heat or some crunch.

The Thai Basil Prawns ($12.95) was supposed to be tiger prawns, but were actually quite small. Moreover, there weren't many of them. The basil was not pronounce. The prawns were served in some goopy sauce without much flavour. The dish didn't come with any rice.

The service is hurried and leaves something to be desired."}
{"text":"I've lived in se Asia for 20 years, some of that in Thailand and have tried most the thai spots that Arizona had to offer.   Hands down this thai basil is the best and very authentic."}
{"text":"Not bad at all. Pleasantly surprised actually. 

Decided to finally try this place out because my friend and I were craving Asian/sushi but didn't feel like paying $25-30 for AYCE. 

The saying \"do not judge a book by it's cover\" fits perfectly for Thai Basil. By the looks of the outside, I was really surprised when I walked in and saw that the interior designing wasn't too shabby! To my surprise, it didn't look like an old, run down crappy \"Asian\" restaurant at all lol.

Our server was probably the friendliest, most polite server I've ever had in my entire life. He made our first time there enjoyable and was actually kind enough to give us some green tea mochi ice creams on the house :) Plus he never let our water glasses go empty, which is an immediate good tip in my book lol.

We decided to order on the safe side and go with bento boxes. All bento boxes come with a miso soup, a choice of meat, rice, vegetable/2 shrimp tempura, edamame, and 4 pieces of either California rolls or spicy tuna rolls. All for the very reasonable price of $10.99. I ordered the chicken teriyaki bento with spicy tuna rolls. 

My friend and I also split the Two Roll Special, which consists of your choice of 2 rolls from their Sumaki Sushi menu. We went with Hamachi and Spicy Salmon (8 pieces each) for $10.99. (Ordering the rolls separately would have been $7.99 each).

Honestly, for the prices, I can't complain about anything I ordered. The bento box was delicious but nothing with a wow factor. And same with the sushi. Everything came out in a timely manner and the portions were perfect.

We ended our dinner with strawberry mochi ice cream but our server ended up giving us every flavor! 

I'll definitely be back to Thai Basil. My friend and I have decided that this is our go-to place whenever we're craving Asian/sushi but don't feel like paying for AYCE. :) I would recommend this place, but don't go in there expecting fine dining our Asian gourmet! Go if you wanna fill your belly and keep your wallet full too lol."}
{"text":"Late last week we went for dinner. We sat outside, because smoking was allowed inside and the restaurant is attached to a bar. I had chicken pad Thai at 3/5 spice level. It was the best I ever had! Chicken was moist and noodles cooked to perfection. My husband had the massaman dish. Great curry dish served with white rice. For starters we had chicken sa-tay, which came with a delicious peanut dipping sauce. And we also had potstickers. They were fried and very tasty. He liked the Thai tea and I enjoyed the fresh young coconut as a beverage. Tonight, we had it to-go via GrubHub. They were over 20 minutes early! We had chicken pad Thai, awesome egg drop soup and wonderful crab rangoons. This is our favorite Thai-Chinese restaurant for sure, in North Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"I could eat here every day, I think. The curry is my favorite. I like a thicker curry, not soupy. They also get the heat amount just right without sacrificing flavor. Always friendly service. They have so much to choose from, and being a vegetarian my options are sometimes limited in other restaurants. The thai iced tea is perfect."}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise this place was! 

One of my coworkers was in the mood for Thai after a work function. Though I'm not super familiar with the cuisine (I've maybe had it 2x ever), I'm not a picky eater so I figured I'd give it a shot.

The vegetarian yellow curry dish was ABSOLUTELY amazing. The creaminess of the curry and coconut milk paired with the veggies and rice literally melted in my mouth. 

Service was wild fast for lunch time. As soon as our butts hit the chairs, we were served ice cold glasses of water along with menus. A few minutes later, we were served a side salad that came with our meal. Honestly, the salad couldn't be anything much more than bagged iceberg lettuce, but it had the most amazing peanut dressing on it. It wasn't hard to gobble up and I can see why they sell it by the bottle for customers to take home.

About 10-15 minutes later, our entrees were served. Super yummy food and great experience all around. Definitely excited to return!"}
{"text":"I attended training at this shopping complex and found Thai Basil. I ordered the Garlic eggplant and spicy noodles. I ate there the entire week!. For the lunch price, you can't beat yummy salad, plate of good portion good with small eggroll. The staff is friendly, restaurant is clean and they are fast. You can sit down and finish your meal within 30 minutes."}
{"text":"This place offers excellent Thai cuisine. They offer every dish in multiple levels (or degrees) of heat. I always get Thai hot, as I love spicy food, and they never disappoint. I've had terrible or mediocre experiences with some Thai restaurants in other cities, but this place is excellent. I recommend the signature dish, Thai Basil, as well as their Pad Thai and Red Curry. There are multiple locations, including Central Phoenix and Ahwatukee. If I have anything bad to say about the restaurant, it would be that the University location is pretty small and when the Fall or Spring semesters at ASU are in session it can get packed quickly."}
{"text":"I love this place! I used to work down the street so would order take out weekly. I recommend Thai basil chicken...comes with rice and apron roll (during lunch) for approx $9.00 

Fresh food, crunchy veggies, moist chicken, great and fast service! I'm sad I don't work nearby anymore"}
{"text":"This isn't exactly a place to write home about, so I won't. What I will say, and all that really needs to be said is that tax, tip and food for an acceptable curry lunch is $10. Hard to complain at those prices."}
{"text":"\"No spice\", \"small lunch special\", waaaah . . . ignore all the babies.  They've never even had real Thai food.  

Thai Basil is effing awesome.  And so is the family that owns the place. 

Now, before all you haters get your panties in a bunch over the 5 stars, read what I have to say-- Thai Basil is not the cleanest, most well decorated Thai restaurant.  And it's not even the best Thai I've ever had.  But it's great food and the best Thai I've had in AZ.  And for the cheap price, awesome, flavorful food, friendly staff and large dinner portions, I give them 5 stars.

Highly recommend the peanut curry, pad Thai and pretty much everything else!"}
{"text":"Dined Wednesday evening with husband. Samples combo appetizer, Tom Kha soup, & Pad Thai with beef. The fried items had a weird taste- perhaps old oil. The soup was ordered medium spice but tasted very mild. The beef in Pad Thai had very little flavor. Thai tea was overly sweet & tasted like it was from concentrate. Both of us had an upset stomach for the rest of the night. 
Service was good & friendly but we will not be dining here again."}
{"text":"Authentic Thai food , with soothing atmosphere, service is excellent thumbs up. If want to try nice Thai please do come here."}
{"text":"My favorite Thai place in Arizona by far! My go to spot for dates, business meetings, and just because it's Wednesday."}
{"text":"A work friend and I walked over from our hotel for dinner tonight- with temperatures above 100 degrees, we were happy that it took less than 5 minutes to stroll over. Thai Basil was recommended by the front desk and rightfully so!!

We were talking a lot at first, and they came over 2 or 3 times to take our order before we were finally ready, but they were patient and pleasant.  I ended up ordering their Pad Woon Sen with tofu and my friend went with the good standby, Pad Thai with chicken. We were asked how spicy we wanted our food and both said medium. The dishes arrived quickly and were really quite large. The spice level on both was just right and I thought the flavors in mine were right on- everything was cooked properly. We both really liked our dinners, and had so much leftover that we had lunch the next day. 

Water refills were frequent and at one point, they just left a carafe of ice water on the table for us. We got there for dinner around 4:10 and were the only table- by the time we left at 6:30, it was hopping! Seems to be a popular eatery near the university.

Oh, and they have good Happy Hour deals on drinks and appetizers from 3-6 every day of the week!"}
{"text":"I ordered the Thai Basil with tofu. It came with a side of jasmine rice.  Dish included a mix of veggies and basil. My choice of meat was tofu. The veggies were cooked just right and tasted fresh while there was also plenty of tofu. Very pleased with the flavor of the food here.  Location is small and started to fill pretty fast. So glad the food came out fast, we were pretty hungry!"}
{"text":"We love this place. We came up with our Harley group the first time here and was very pleased . This is the original Thai Basil restaurant.  We had never tried Thai as we thought it was spicy. Here they ask you for a spice level 0-10. ;) we do 0 and its mouth  watering. Come one come all !!"}
{"text":"2.5/5

They are across the road from Restoran Malaysia, as far as I know, the only other Southeast Asian restaurant around Bayview and Major Mackenzie area. 

Based on food quality alone, I think Restoran Malaysia would be a no brainier. 

I can't comment on the authenticity of the food, but I found it to be very mediocre. 

What really grinds my gears is the attitude of the waitresses. They are like apathetic teenagers forced to do chores."}
{"text":"Best Thai food in Tempe! The atmosphere is wonderful, the air is always full of mouthwatering spice aromas, and you can pick literally anything off the menu with a guarantee of deliciousness. The yellow curry with mild spice and tofu is my personal favorite as a vegetarian, the coconut milk based sauce is to die for and pairs nicely with the small spice of the dish. I highly recommend the mango sticky rice for a filling and subtly sweet treat. The staff are also very sweet and exceptionally efficient! I'm a regular and I love it here! Keep up the great work."}
{"text":"Excellent thai food!  Really fresh & lots of great vegetables.  Four of us came in for dinner tonite & ordered 2 orders of green curry, one of house special (Thai Basil Chicken), & an order of BBQ chicken.  All are served with complimentary white rice.  Food came quickly, we were seated immediately, and it was really, really good.  More than enough too, we couldn't finish all of it.  I was blown away at how good all this food was.  The restaurant is large enough so that you don't feel squeezed in & looked clean.  Most dinner items were about $9.95 or so, which as I said includes rice on most of them.  I would come back here every week if I lived close enough."}
{"text":"Was very excited to try out Thai Basil after all the good reviews we heard from people surrounding our hotel. I had heard that the pad Thai was absolutely delicious. I ordered the chicken pad Thai - *extra spicy! After picking up our two orders and heading back to our rooms we discovered that they had only given us one fork for two separate orders, no big deal. However, then we discovered our pad Thai was missing some of the listed menu ingredients including the peanuts. The sauce was not spicy, but very thick, overly sweet and wayyy too heavily poured over our food. Unfortunately this was not a very great first impression, and we probably will not be back for more. Being flight attendants we love finding hidden gems surrounding the hotels we stay at, for the price and quality of food at Thai Basil - this is unfortunately not one of them."}
{"text":"Food was pretty quick and delicious! Mango sticky rice was divine. Although the thai hot wasn't very spicy."}
{"text":"I'm not an expert on Thai cuisine by any means, but the Iced Thai Tea is just...well...awesome at this place."}
{"text":"Just a lot of Hype. I traveled to Toronto Canada Aug 6-9, 2016*.  If you are looking for spicy and authentic Thai food like you can easily find in NYC and Elmhurst Queens don't even waist your time with this restaurant. Ingredients that obviously should have been used in some of their dishes like coconut milk has been substituted by regular milk in their curry meal, awful!  Too creamy and no taste ! Why should you swallow my comment and take it to heart ? Because I care about your wallet and hardship that comes with getting ripped off. Everyone on here saying how great this restaurant is are customers who love to eat sweet candy food. So be smart and shop around. To be honest I think the restaurant that my wife and I by accident stumbled upon on 570 Bloor Street West called Real Thailand Restaurant was spot on for freshness and authenticity. They do like most restaurants make their food mild so that customers aren't chased away. So remember to indicate you want your food spicy. 
Hope this helps ya......."}
{"text":"Thai Basil is one of the best Thai restaurants that I've been too.  It's a real Thai restaurant run by Thai people.

Red and green curries are amazing and pretty decent portions too.  You definitely need to try their BBQ pork, it's so tender and juicy.    If you love spicy you will like their sambal sauce.  Not sure if they make it their own but doesn't taste like the store bought one.

Note if you go there during lunch and order from their lunch menu, don't order the pad thai with chicken and shrimp, just get chicken.  It's $2 more for shrimp, and all you get are 2 pieces.  It happened to me once and then to another corworker."}
{"text":"Amaaaaaaaaazing. 
They have some of the best Thai food in the valley, fosho. (And I'm a Thai food junkie)

Unfortunately they don't deliver, but it's worth the extra time to pick up for take-out. :)

Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Excellent service, they bring you a delicious soup to start with and everything I had was very scrumptious. I'm defiantly going there again."}
{"text":"Remember the movie Brokedown Palace with Claire Danes and Kate Beckinsale? And all of the Thai people were so mean to them. 

Oh. It has nothing to do with this review. I was just asking if you remembered that movie. Anyway, you won't find mean Thai people here. It's definitely a team  effort here and everyone was very helpful and most friendly. 

Seating is rather awkward as their isn't any signage indicating what to do, wait or sit. Or order inside. But I was quickly invited to sit wherever. Before I knew it a cold, crisp, simple salad and a menu was place in front of me. Yay! Free salad. The dressing was SO good. I bet Kate Beckinsale and Claire Danes didn't get free salad. Course they were too busy being pistol whipped by the prison guards. 

Anyhoo...I ordered the pad thai and it was fantastic. Though I would have loved more tofu. It came with the cutest little spring and a wedge of cold watermelon. YUM! Love watermelon as it so refreshing. 

All this for around eight bucks. I bet you Kate Beckinsale and Claire Danes...oh...never mind. Just get your butt to Thai Basil. Where you will be greeted warmly, served efficiently and probably, won't get pistol whipped by a lesbian Thai prison guard."}
{"text":"My wife and I really like good Thai food. My dishes had fresh ingredients, the service was also exceptional. Top it off with some homemade coconut ice cream. Very good!"}
{"text":"Imitation crab is something, I cannot stand - I mean I would rather have fish. This is one of the first (budget) places in the valley where I ate great crab meat, and, they also made sure they told me they use imitation carb (for its consistency) in some of their dishes. Shows they care for their customers tastes.

Their curries are creamy, stir frys yummy and the service is good without being too intrusive. You can taste the freshness in the ingredients, and, the earnest flavors in every dish.

My personal favorites -
- Pad see eew
- Eggplant Garlic with crab meat
- Purple rice pudding with fresh mango
- All their curries are creamy and flavorful - try them with salmon, I promise you won't miss meat"}
{"text":"I really had high hopes for this place, as I was really craving some really good Thai food.. I just finished eating, and here is what I ordered..

1. Pork crispy spring rolls (I wanted chicken, they said they don't have?) 4 out of 5.. I have to say, I'm not a big fan of pork, I prefer chicken or beef but you can't go wrong with it in sprig rolls. I'd definitely order these again.

2. Chili pork basil noodles (again no chicken?) 3 out of 5.. it wasn't bad but it wasn't the best.. it was my first time having it, I usually get the pad thai or glass noodles (my personal favorite). I wanted to try something new, so I got this and that's what happens. Lol

3. Garlic beef, it came with broccoli as well.. 2 out of 5.. I didn't enjoy it, but I still have left overs and I will try to finish it (I don't like wasting food, so I will try not to). It didn't have the taste I was expecting, I guess I was expecting to much?

4. Tom young soup with fish balls (I think that's what it is called). The soup I enjoyed.. it had a weird flavor to it, I can't put my finger on it, but I liked it. It's spicy too, it gave it a kick. The fish balls in it, I did Not enjoy.. I did not like the taste of it.  I was expecting something like chunked up fish cake but it tasted like something else.

5. White rice. Plane jasmine rice, I like rice so I'm not going to complain. It's simple, cooked right.

6. Peanut Sauce. It was good, I liked it.. all in all it was an okay experience for me, but I will stick to my regular orders when I get Thai food next time. I made the server decide my order as I felt daring today ;) next time I will follow my instinct, lol. The End."}
{"text":"I don't know if this place is the same as the one on rural rd, neither am i sure if they have the same owners! But, I have only been to this one on University drive!

So my opinion? I actually love it! It is cozy, relaxing, small and very neat inside, with a tiny hint of a fast-food ambiance. Nonetheless, the food is so delicious and usually comes pretty quick! 

I've ordered the chicken green curry, red curry, and also a sautéed plate/platter. I was always so satisfied and feeling like I've reached nirvana! Their curry is just right, creamy, flavorful and has the right amount of heat (I always ask for medium, and it always comes a bit milder than medium, but I still love it!). Also the veggies seem so tasty, crisp and fresh!

With about $10 a plate, it's one of the cheapest/most delicious meals you can have! I ALWAYS take some leftover home! And even then, I eat the leftover in 2 settings!"}
{"text":"Great lunch specials! Caters well to vegetarians and can make dishes without fish sauce."}
{"text":"Yesterday I was craving some Thai and after another restaurant wasn't open we were going to go to we decided to try out Thai Basil.  It is located in the mall off central and is a small little place with decent decor.  

Upon walking in we were greated and told to take the open table in the corner.  We were handed menu's and after about 10 min our waiter came to take our orders.  For me it was a bit longer then needed but whatever I was ready to try out the food.  So I ordered the Panang Curry which is one of my favorite Thai dishes and Laura got the Pad Thai everyone said was the best here.

After about another 10 min we got our food her's came out a good couple min before mine which I thought was not professional but ok at least her's was hot and mine was too when they came out.  So I sampled her Pad Thai and it was good but not what I had been reading in reviews as everyone said it was amazing.  My dish was just ok the curry had no spice to it at all.  

So overall it was ok Thai food there are plenty other places in town that I feel are better so I probably will head to them when I want more Thai."}
{"text":"Thai Basil is just delicious! I love Thai food but i try not t drag the bf along too much since he has not yet found a Thai place that has a dish he really loves but that changes since bringing him here ! WHOOP WHOOP!   Really good and quick service for either eating in or taking to go ( we have done both). He is in love right now with their chow mein and i as always am a big fan of Pad Thai.  their pad Thai is not as spicy as other places i have been which is ok considering i can spice it up myself if necessary. only downfall for me is i am not a fan t all of their sweet and sour pork which is a big deal for me, since next to Pad Thai that is definitely a second.  

Their chicken sa tay and spring rolls are really good as well!

Cheap!"}
{"text":"Horrible service & food at this particular Thai Basil. Thai is supposed to be spicy right? Not here! When we asked for Chili oil they were clueless and called it salsa! WTH. We ordered the lettuce wraps appitizer which took a while to get. The lettuce was chopped into small pieces which made it difficult to eat as a \"wrap\". My friend ordered curry, I ordered the Pad Pak, and my fiance ordered the Drunken Noodle. Curry was served long before my fiance and I recieved our dishes. They knew they messed up by bringing out the curry so early and tried to cover by asking if my friend wanted to share her curry with us. WTH! umm no we all ordered diferent dishes that should've come out with hers. If she had wanted to share she woulld've offered, and asked for bowls herself. Geez!"}
{"text":"They not the original owners of Thai Basil.  The restaurant was sold to another proprietor and kept the name.  They serve a variety of Asian food, Japanese sushi and soup, Chinese, and Thai.  They are the futon of Asian restaurants, and like a futon, it's okay at all things and really good at nothing.

I had the chicken satay and Pud Thai and I my friend had an order of sushi.  The sushi was not bad but the Thai food was terrible.  From the moment Pud Thai was brought to me, I can tell before putting in my mouth, it wasn't going be good.  They didn't use Thai Rice Sticks noodles and they used Chinese red bbq pork.  Chicken satay was good for erasing pencil marks on the table.

I'm not saying one has to be Thai to cook good Thai food but they're not Khun Thai and they can't cook Thai.  

Take it from a Thai, look else where for Thai Food.  Mai Aroi."}
{"text":"This place is always packed and there's a reason for that, and that is the food.  It's definitely not the ambiance, decor, or surroundings.  I ordered my chicken curry \"Thai Spicy\", which supposedly was the most burning level which I like, and I expected it to burn at both ends, but it was disappointingly mild."}
{"text":"Thai Basil, Sweet Basil, Thai Basil Kitchen... Sometimes I really confused which one I been to.. which one I hate... which one I would recommend... 

Thai Basil is another new Thai restaurant that opened up right across from Restoran Malaysia, hint if there is a hour line up at Restoran Malaysia maybe you can just hop over and try Thai Basil instead. 

Thai Basil suppose to be a second location from the successful location down at the Annex http://www.yelp.ca/biz/thai-basil-toronto 

Lunch Special starting from $6.95 is from everyday till 5 pm which is great for late lunch. 

If you ask me if the food is authentic Thai... from my few visit to Thailand and my experience of Thai food, I have to say no... 
What is lacking then?? The spice and the herbs and the freshness of Thai cuisine that's what it is lacking... 

Pad Thai with Chicken Lunch Combo ($7.95) 
- Tom Yum Soup that comes with the lunch combo is one of the better one I have in Toronto... thick, with hint of coriander and mushed tomato... tons of chili pepper flakes inside and is really rich in taste... definitely not the water down version or the ones from the supermarket's Tom Yum paste 
- Spring Roll was quite good... has a lot of flavours and nice and crispy 
- Pad Thai, on the other hand, was not up to par. Too much sauce makes it really soggy and oily... and it is not as good as the photos definitely not as good! The taste is really one dimension and on the salty side. The Chicken though is white meat was tough and dry... 

Services was not too bad...efficient but you have the feeling that the waitresses wish they are somewhere else.. somewhere nice and warm where people bring them drinks instead of the other way around! 

They accepts Visa and Mastercard!"}
{"text":"I found this gem thanks to Yelp (of course).  I was looking for a good Thai place to refuel after running a triathlon in Tempe, and as it turns out, this was a great choice.  The portions were bigger than expected, the food was delicious, and the  staff was friendly and attentive.  Good value for the money, too.  I had the chicken Pad Prik King and my wife had the Panang curry.  I would recommend both of them."}
{"text":"Been here about 3-4 times now, usually just to satisfy my Panang Curry and/or TomYum soup craving. they make it pretty well, with just the right amount of spice and sweetness for both. 

the atmosphere is nicely rounded out with cultural decor, but it does get pretty loud as the tables are close together. the service is decent.. when you can get some. it's pretty hard to flag someone down since it gets quite busy during dinner time. 

all in all they get the job done, and I always leave full and happy. :)"}
{"text":"Ok, saw this place open up in the past few weeks, thought i would give it a try.  It was a great experiance.  I very rarely rate 5 stars for anything.  However, the food, the portion and quality was sufficant and the service was great.  The place was simple, yet clean, and the staff was polite and attentive.  Overall, great experiance.  I will return to this restaurant for lunch."}
{"text":"This is hands down my favorite Thai restaurant! We're here at least once a week. Chicken panang and pad Thai is the best I've had. The food is fresh fast and hot. The staff here are sooooo friendly."}
{"text":"No pretense, just polite people in a clean environment serving very flavorful Thai food.

Chicken sweet and sour and beef pad thai. Both artfully presented. Decent quantity for a fair price. Both proteins cooked well. Veggies were crisp. Good mix of spices, nice flavors. Rice was fluffy, soft and tasty. Thai iced tea was great. Thai chai green tea was OK.

Spice level 3 was a hair on the too-mild side for my taste. I can't imagine that level 2 would have any fire to it at all.

Very competent. Will be coming back. Definitely no reason to drive to old downtown Scottsdale for Thai food any longer."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by Thai Basil. First of all, I'm not sure why I had never been there before, because it's a gorgeous restaurant inside. Great decor, really nice cutlery and dishes, and a nice atmosphere in general.

The menu makes it really difficult for an indecisive person like me...I was very close to ordering everything! Every dish looks/sounds/smells delicious. I was looking at everyone else's food to get a feel of what to order, but then I realized it was all good. And that insert with the HUGE booze list... They had all sorts of neat cocktails and non-alcoholic drinks. Plus imported Thai tea. Mmm.

I ended up getting the $14 dinner combo which was sensational. Their lemongrass soup is TO DIE FOR. I have never had such good soup in my life -- it was the perfect combination of creamy and spicy without either of them overwhelming the dish. Plus it had huge chunks of chicken (sorry vegetarians) and mushrooms. And I LOVE mushrooms. 

The combo also came with vegetarian spring rolls, which were decent, and Pad Thai. My friend got the cold rolls, which I got to try one of -- sooooo good. I've tried to make cold rolls before, and theirs are folded so neatly and perfectly compared to the mess mine were. There were also tons of options for vegetarians, which is great, and usually means they have tons of fresh veggies in their kitchen.

And I tend to judge every Thai restaurant by the Pad Thai (if they screw that up, then there's no hope) -- Thai Basil passed with flying colours. Perfect sauce seasoning, great mix of meat and veg, not too saucy, not too dry (à la Salad King), gave me a lime instead of a lemon...so delicious.

Basically this place rules. Great food, great service, and a really interesting menu that makes me want to go everyday. I'm sold."}
{"text":"Delicious food and great service every time! I have been here a few times and it has never failed to disappoint. The lunch specials are very good value for the huge portions you get. For dessert, their fried banana with mango ice cream is so good! The overall atmosphere and ambience is very unique as well. This is definitely my favourite place for Thai food in Richmond Hill!"}
{"text":"Was this the best Thai food I've ever had? No. But it was so far the best I've found in Toronto. The restaurant is nice inside, the food came out really quickly, and the service was good. I'd definitely come back again and try a few other dishes. I got a red curry chicken and it was pretty good."}
{"text":"Definitely the best Thai food in Madison!
I would strongly recommend pad Thai (that no place could beat), drunken noodle (go with a slight spicy level) and Satay chicken (it's amazing with that peanut sauce and pickled cucumbers).
The only thing to complain about is, there will always be a long wait. The best way to get your food is to call and order in advance, then pick up."}
{"text":"I ordered the red beef curry and it is the kind of curry that I was expecting. Nothing fancy, but still acceptable thai food."}
{"text":"Here. Have a star for every shrimp you put in my stale papaya salad, bastards."}
{"text":"Something about clicking 3 stars and it turning into orange vs red makes it feel so negative. But 3 stars is best for Thai Basil. It's a business tuck behind an older plaza in its own world back there and it has been there for I don't know how long. I've been here for 12 years and it was all ready in business. So it must be doing something right. 

My very first encounter here I had ordered their sweet and sour pork. I remember thinking how tasty it was and that it wasn't fatty or the batter was just all of cornstarch. From then on, I always had a good impression of them.

Years later...the impression is still the same. However, I have discovered that they're just average eating. They are a little bit more steep with their prices considering in my opinion for what you get. However, our area is super scarce in Thai fare and so I appreciate their business for when we just want some good ole Thai curry without putting mileage in.

Overall, because they aren't anything out of the ordinary and we've had tastier, personally feel they are more of a 3. Since we don't have much Thai options in our area, them offering a touch of japanese, vietnamese, and Chinese fare...they deserve a 4. We have not had 1 bad experience nor have they goofed on our orders. They do offer bento boxes and I think thats at a great deal.

Nothing to cross the border for. Just one of those go-to spots if you're pressed for time, gas tank is nearing empty and there's 3 days left until payday, but really need a curry fix while your significant other prefers sushi because they do have a sushi bar!

Give 'em a shot if that sounds like you. Won't ever tell you not to. Definitely kid and stroller friendly!

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I had this today for lunch. I got the Pad See Ew which is my favorite Thai street dish. I'm half Thai so I've eaten Thai food all my life. I was very sad to say with all their reviews it was bland, very flavorless. The noodles are supposed to be dark in color from the soy sauce used but they were white with just a hint of color. Egg rolls were very dry too and bland."}
{"text":"Great Thai restaurant!! But my one piece of advice, order something authentic like Tom Yum or Coconut Soup and not so much Pad Thai - I definitely wouldn't recommend it if you're a Thai food snob! But, great other lunch combos, especially curry related and Great Ambiance! and Amazing Mango Tea!!"}
{"text":"The food is great...service is pretty fair enough (during the lunch crowd). The only reason why I can't really give this more stars is because...well...I'm originally from Cali and they have amazing Asian food there that just can't compared to what you get here. But this place is great and I would definitely recommend to try their special of of the day (they have been so good thus far). I don't eat salad, but I've heard so much good things about their salad that comes with your meal."}
{"text":"Ehhh so so. Their Pantai wasn't spicy enough. The rolls were warm and sushi not too fresh. There are better places"}
{"text":"Ordered take-out last night. 

Here is my report card:
 -Tom ka gai  (coconut soup)  = A+
- Pad Thai = meh = C-

So out of the all the Thai places I have eaten at, this is actually the worst pad thai I've had :o( which I hate to say because the people that work here are so sweet. My noodles were very dry and were lacking that great pad thai sauce. 

coconut soup was amazing! The only problem was that I asked for chicken and I only got Tofu. Which is totally cool because I love tofu, but technically my order was wrong.

Would I eat here again? Yes! But next time no pad thai for me!"}
{"text":"Delicious and FRESH (spring) Rolls and Shrimp Salad. Fantastic flavors and perfect for a warm Spring dinner. Can't wait to try more on the menu when I'm in town next time!"}
{"text":"I really love Thai Basil. I usually get the red curry - great portion of curry and rice. The restaurant is not huge so it can get packed for lunch sometimes. If you like coconut, definitely try the coconut ice cream. It is more expensive than other places near by the university, at least $10 for a dish. But they are one of the only Thai places near ASU and very good."}
{"text":"I am pretty picky with my Thai food because it is one of my FAVORITE kinds of food! Thai Basil has the sweetest employees and such great food! 

My favorite Thai dish is Chicken Penang Curry with white rice, and Thai Basil makes it amazingly! I get this every single time I go here-try it! 

I would highly recommend this cute little restaurant. It's pretty casual and quick! Love it!"}
{"text":"Came here for quick takeout while taking care of my sister who recently had a minor surgery. I was trying to find some good Pho that I thought maybe would be easy on her stomach. Unfortunately, she wasn't interested but I had a Thai craving nonetheless. 

The menu was completely available online which was a bonus. But I chose two simple favorites: Pad Thai and spring rolls. Both were fairly good. The Pad Thai was very dry and lacking quite a bit of flavor. It was really not very good. The spring rolls were okay. It's pretty difficult to screw those up. All in all, it's quick and easy Thai if you're in a bind and near to the West side."}
{"text":"This is hands-down still my favorite Thai restaurant in the Phoenix area. 

All I need to say is \"I love curry\", and they by far have the best green curry in town. 

The food is consistently amazing and the portions are very generous (I usually get a second meal out of my entree leftovers), and I have never been disappointed"}
{"text":"so good, good thing I didn't listen to the nay sayers on these reviews here. Delicious food, great service and food came out fast. Bomb!! Food!!!"}
{"text":"My absolute favorite Thai place in Madison. The drunken noodles are perfection (although I order without tomatoes). Absolutely wonderful (I've been there twice in a week!). The person taking orders is always really pleasant, too, even when taking a high volume of orders at once. The only downside is that I can't bring my family here because of carryout only - but if that's the only knock against a place, so be it!"}
{"text":"I go here with my family and its suitable for us with 3 small kids to enjoy a lovely and elegant dinner. With some jazz music on the backgroud it becomes a classy and relaxing setting.  Its also great for group or business dining and peers would be highly impressed.

Dinner is usually busy and why wouldn't it.  Fabulous interior that practically captivates me.  The soothing waterfalls at the door is a calm retreat from a very busy day; the cozy hues and warm glow of reds, browns, and gold whet the appetite alongwith the sweet, spicy, and citrus aroma that fill the room; the satin like shimmer of lime green leather seats plus hard wood floors suggest elegance with impeccable taste; the exotic and calming appeal of Buddha with its head carved at every wall; and the etched aquamarine glass wall refreshes the senses. 
 
The menu is amazing.  Numerous yet enough excellent choices.  I cook Thai food myself and I can say they prepare theirs with love.  The down side may be on its authenticity being tame on the chillies and spices and also on the stronger aroma of citrus herbs.  But the rich, bold, and playful flavours are positively satisfying.  Not all Thai food, though.  Some items are Malaysian or Chinese or Vietnamese - wearing a Thai hat - just a note.

I look at each item carefully reading the ingredients and I'm glad that they have \"peanuts\" underlined clearly. Its a major concern for my little boy, you see, so I thought how keen these people are with good customer sense.

Main dishes range from $9-15.  But I'll log back in for a more detailed review on their food which are becoming more interesting as of this writing.  For now I leave you with: great food and wonderful experience at Thai Basil."}
{"text":"Had lunch here. Dined on chicken panang. It was excellent. Spice range was in the middle, (just right for not asking me how hot I wanted it) with good quality thinly sliced chicken breast, onions, and just a few diced green pepper and tomatoes. Panang is one of my favorite dishes and I thought it was excellent. We also had Thai Basil Chicken entree, this plate is served with bamboo shoots, carrots & bok choy. This was also excellent. The good quality of these dishes, make up for the somewhat small portions here. I was also surprised that a small soup and egg roll is NOT part of the lunch special. Oh well, it's offered, you'll just have to pay a few more dollars. I really like this place. I've been here 4 times for lunch now and liked it each time. Two lunch plates and two drinks, $17.95 with tax. Quality food and a reasonable portion size, is better than eating alot of oily, larger portions offered at many places. Give this place a try."}
{"text":"Try their coconut milk soup and pad Thai to start. It's my go-to food to test out new Thai places. It's always spot on! Love coming to get take out and eating in is always nice with friendly service. They aren't joking around with the sign outside about the salad dressing either! It's yummy!!"}
{"text":"I've visited Thailand before and I am very impressed with Thai Basil because it tastes pretty authentic - especially the curry and the pad Thai. Service is food and the price is very reasonable. Highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"The red curry here is the best curry I've had in all the Thai places I've been. I've tried to order something else on the menu here but it just made me want the curry even more. Not that it's the only thing they do but it's just so good man!"}
{"text":"Do not judge this hidden jewel by the exterior. To be quite honest this was my second time going there and first time eating there.. I pulled up and it was so dark I was detoured to another local spot. Today was my second visit I was taken there by someone who frequents the place and spoke highly of their authenticity. 
Upon entering I immediately felt relaxed. The Asian imports furnishing this little place are just gorgeous! We were greeted and sat quickly. There were hardly any people inside although a few couples did trickle in while we dined. Simply put the place has very good energy. 
The menu was simple and I wanted a little taste of everything so I chose the bento box- everything was tasty- the miso soup was chalked full of tofu.
My entree was the basil chicken and thankfully the veggies were wokd fresh and the spice was just right. Their bentos come with four pieces of sushi with an option for California roll or spicy tuna.. I opted for the spicy tuna and it was pretty good. My bento also came with two tempura shrimp which were fried perfectly. Food was above average the quaintness of the place makes it a real delight. I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"This is really a 3.5 star place but I would rather bump them up to four stars.

This place is a sushi bar, Thai, Chinese, Vietnamese place!  I like the tables and chairs in here.  It was like going to your Asian friends house.  

I had the green chicken curry - it was tasty and on the spicy side.  I also have had a bento box here.  This place isn't an authentic type of place - but the food is good.  It's a better than your typical neighborhood chines restaurant.

The prices are very reasonable!"}
{"text":"I love Thai food, and when I say love I mean love. This place is a little hidden gem for us in North Las Vegas. My bf and I normally get the different curries and occasionally I get Pad Thai. The Pad Thai is a little greasy for my liking but the curries are so yummy. Prices are pretty reasonable. The service is always prompt and friendly. And it's really is the only Thai place within a 15 min drive from my house which makes it all the better. It's kind of hidden so I think that might be the reason it's so quiet there. Oh yeah, and the appetizers are great too!"}
{"text":"I don't really have much to say about this place.  There's nothing wrong with it, but their dishes don't \"pop\" for me.  They are not very flavorful (crazy for a thai place, right?) and I often find myself adding Fish Sauce and Chili just to get it to be good.  Lunch prices are fair, food seems fresh and service is great.  My coworkers LOVE this place and I enjoy their company, so I tag along.

Best part is they have soy milk for their Thai Tea.  For me, it's the best part of the meal."}
{"text":"Ok! First off. What's up with the waitress texting behind the the bar the whole time I was waiting for my meal, for a 1/2 an hr,In front of everyone! Geez!!!!  And!! When she caught me watching her, she moves over to the right to hide so that she can continue her texting conversation. She must have been the owners daughter, because if she was my employee, I would have fired her on the spot. I am serious! the whole time we were there, she was texting. 

So we finally I got my meal. The red curry was soooo watered down, one chunk of pine apple, the hot level I requested, HOT! Was mild, and about 5 pieces of chicken. I had to add the cheesy cheap hot sauce to my meal, to make it an almost medium level. ten minutes into my meal, a couple next to us walked out, not too sure why, but I'm sure it had something to do with the lack of service or some \"Employee\" too busy texting to help customers. This is unacceptable, I decided not to return,

 But! to Let you all know, watch out! Don't order the red curry, its watered down coconut milk, and and a lack Of meat. What a joke! My homemade curry kicks ass, and doesn't lack any meat! This goes for my local thai restuarnt as well. I've  been there a few times before, why the lack of customer service and the quality of food this time? Not sure, but it only takes one time to turn me off, and this is it, The worst red curry ever. I'm going to my fav local thai restaurant for now on. They get one star, for the available parking."}
{"text":"Great food and amazing service. Our server Justin was very good. He gave us the perfect amount of attention and was warm, friendly and funny. He also adjusted our check for us because we weren't fans of one of the items we ordered (too spicy, lol). We will definitely be eating here again soon! 5 stars for food and 6 stars for service!"}
{"text":"Fantastic place to eat. Great location and excellent service. The owners are extremely nice people. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Ok...so I have been back a few times and I have a serious problem with this place. They will not make my food spicy. For real. I order hot and the food is bland and lacking any sort of spice....it makes no sense! I have gotten the spicy noodles each time which is a misnomer because the noodles have never once been spicy...at all. After visiting several other thai food places around phoenix I have realized that this one is one of the worst...sad to say. It just doesn't have the flavor that other restaurants have....sorry thai basil."}
{"text":"I strongly think this is a hidden gem in Richmond Hill and would highly recommend it for Thai food. I had Pad Woon Sen (good) and \"Mussamun\" Curry Beef Brisket (amazing!!)

I am eating my leftovers from last night and I am still drooling over the brisket.
They also do takeout and have ample of parking as it is in a commercial plaza."}
{"text":"This location of Thai basil gets extra cred... why? Because they have build your own curry noodle bowls!!! Oh yes.... this is a giant bowl of whatever curry you want paired with noodles of your choosing and it is fabulous..... also, it is inexpensive (under 10$). I would come here for that alone."}
{"text":"The best Tom Yum Soup you will ever taste in your life. I've tried many fast food Thai places, and other Viet/Asian Fusion restaurants, but everyone else has a watery and pasty mess that ruins the complexity of the dish. If you are a fan of Tom Yum, give Thai Basil a sure try.

Other than that, I really love the atmosphere of the restaurant. It's authentic, clean, peaceful, and perfect for a small group to relax and have a good meal.

Yes, Thai Basil is a bit pricey compared to the other food options in the Bayview Plaza, but what I typically order is the Combo for One, and I would share it with someone else, or even among a group of three. You will receive a big spring roll, a good quantity of Tom Yum, and a HUGE plate of Pad Thai! And everything is extremely tasteful and delicious."}
{"text":"The food here is great, the location is perfect, the seating arrangement on the other hand is about as comfortable as the DC Metro at rush hour. 

I guess it says a lot about the quality of the food when you are willing to get stuffed into the seats like you are about to takeoff on a Southwest flight to Midway and still you choose to give this place 4 stars.  

Unlike Southwest, the place gets you to your destination in one piece.  The portions are perfect, the vegetables are not over done and the little egg-roll with every meal is a nice touch. The upside to this place is that it holds top billing for thai style curry in the entire downtown area."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner. I had their special Basil w chicken and vegetables. It was good but not amazing. We also got the shrimp spring rolls. These were very good. I got my husband the drunken noodles and he did not like it at all. I don't want to judge off of one experience so I'll go back and try different items on the menu. I'm hoping other items will b better because I love Thai food."}
{"text":"Great place to get some Thai takeout...

Lemme tell you, if you ask for 'extra spicy', be prepared to get what you asked for... I got an order of larb that was so hot it made my eyes water & my lips were on fire for about an hour!  Man was it awesome Good though...

I try to eat here at least once when I am in town."}
{"text":"This was my favorite place to order thai take-out from when living in Tempe (although they also have nice decor and good service if you are in the mood to dine-in).  I love the curries, especially the panang curry. I also love the pad thai noodles and their tom kha  soup. Their food is always consistently delicious (this goes for both their Rural Rd and University locations).  The only dish that has ever left me disappointed, oddly enough, is their signature thai basil dish."}
{"text":"I went to this place when it opened many years ago, and now that I haves moved into the area I figured I would give it a shot. BAD MiSTAKE!!!!!

I am embarrassed for this restaurant. I have never had such horrible food. There is absolutely no authenticity to anything that resembles Thai cuisine. If you can't make fried rice taste at least decent then it's probably time to close up shop and stop embarrassing yourself. 

We ate last night and have already spent most of the morning in the restroom. It sucks that I paid hard earned money to feel as shitty as I currently do. 

I wouldn't recommend this restaurant to a homeless dog in need of a meal to survive."}
{"text":"One of the best chicken panangs (coconut curry) out there.  I actually crave this dish when I don't have it for awhile.  I like to get there early to avoid the crowds.  Seating is a bit tight but if you get there early and it's nice out, the patio dining is really nice.  Also delicious is the pad thai.  My sons like to get it spicy.  I'm sure the rest of their food is wonderful but seriously have not gotten past the two mentioned above.  :D"}
{"text":"Best Panang in Arizona and they have huge plates both dine in and take out. Great deal and some of the best Thai food I've had"}
{"text":"Very quiet and cozy place. The food has super flavor we had the Thai basil chicken and loved it! We had crab puff appetizer also tasty and enjoyable. 

We will be back to try more of the yum for sure. Thai ice tea is an interesting item as well check it out when ur there!"}
{"text":"Clean restaurant, prompt accurate service but the food is just adequate. In the world of Thai food & sushi, I expect more flavor. For some reason it was all fairly bland. We had a party of four adults, we all ordered different food and shared. It was all consistently bland. It was ok, but not in any way exceptional."}
{"text":"First, let me say I am NOT a Thai food expert. I either like my food and the restaurant experience, or I don't.
I like this place.
Service was prompt and quiet. Food was piping hot and freshly prepared. 
The eggroll was crispy and fresh (which is something that seldom happens with eggrolls-I know not why...)
My water was never even allowed to get half full.
Of course, the fact that I decided to sit at the bar may have had something to do with the prompt water refills, but they still get points for it!

I enjoyed my meal.  it didn't seem to have very complex flavors, but I ate every scrap and will go back and eat there again.

One little criticism.  Teeny tiny.  I hate the way they cut their carrots.  But that didn't change their taste.  Of course I ate them!
Oh, I liked the orange wedge that came with lunch.  Nice touch.
:)"}
{"text":"This place has awesome food.  If you are looking for flavor, this is it.  it's a bit pricey tho.  Under $10 for a meal for lunch, not what I am willing to pay.  But when I feel like splurging this is it."}
{"text":"3.5 stars.
This restaurants offer lunch specials daily 1130am to 5pm. Lunch specials come with spring rolls, small soup, and an entree for under $10 which is a good deal. We had Thai green curry; not amazing but it's very decent; average to above average. 
We also had the Basil chili fried noodles with minced pork. The Basil rice noodles were quite delish, nicely spiced and aromatic with basil; I didn't care much for the minced pork part. I wish they would offer this stir fried noodles with a different choice of meat.
Lunch specials were decent deals. Will come back if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"One of our favorite Thai/asian places on Madison's westside. They deliver which is nice and never takes too long. Usually they are here sooner than they say. We also pick up a lot and the owner is usually there and very friendly.

I really enjoy their pad Thai and spicy fried rice. My husband always gets the spicy basil with chicken. The green curry is also very good.

The crab rangoon is also pretty good. The filling isn't to sweet like other places and there is a decent amount in them.

Overall good food and service."}
{"text":"did the thai basil prawn, was more the size of a shrimp
hot and tasty 
service was fast 
music too loud 
cramp seating 
but over-all i would go there again."}
{"text":"Salad dressing DELICIOUS,!  The rest of the meal and service was just as good, fast, friendly and totally yummy ."}
{"text":"This place is worth the wait! [and I'm not a fan of asianesque food]

I recently went with a friend for lunch and we waited 20 minutes for a table but once seated we were promptly served the lunch soup. I ordered the chili garlic with brown rice. Per usual, I ordered it 'hot, extra hot'. They delivered, my food was spicy and delicious. My friend sneak a bit from plate and almost threw up, he couldn't take the hotness. As we were leaving he said he was 'breaking a sweat' as his mouth simmered down from my chili garlic.  The food and service were great if you don't mind the wait."}
{"text":"Heard good things about this place so I've been wanting to try it for a while. Ordered the pad thai--it was OK... I had leftovers because they give you so much but didn't even want to heat it up as it coagulated all together and looked extremely dried up. I feel like this place is on par to fast food. I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Now that I live two blocks away from Thai Basil, I think this will be my regular take-out/delivery spot. I have had it twice within a week. I'm not obsessed.

Lately, I've been ordering the Evil Jungle Noodles. It really isn't as evil as you'd think, as in, it wasn't very spicy, but the right amount of spicy. I got it with tofu, which I love. They use fried tofu, so what's not to love?

My boyfriend always gets the Mango Shrimp Curry. Turns out, you can get it with any meat, but on the menu it says just shrimp. I would have never expected to like something sweet and fruity like mango in a curry, but it works very well.

The chicken satay here is pretty decent for the price. The peanut sauce is standard, which is a good thing."}
{"text":"My absolute favorite Thai place I've ever been. The prices are so reasonable. They've got lunch portions. If you're looking for a soup, get the tum yum soup. The spring rolls are also my fav appetizer here. I'm a fan of the other location on university, but this one is better located to campus than that one. Definitely a great go-to if you're around the area and don't know what to eat!"}
{"text":"Everything is relatively decent, a lot better than salad King but definitely not as good as khao San road. I especially like their green curry, seafood baked in coconut, but I do not recommend their Pad Thai at all, it is quite dry and most importantly their sauce seem to just be ketchup, overly sweet and barely any other flavor, which is so disappointing."}
{"text":"Worst thai food i've had-- nearly inedible. Small menu, no spice rack. Drunken noodles didn't even taste like the right dish. Never again."}
{"text":"I ate it but it wasn't the best. Tried an eel roll as well and was slightly disappointed."}
{"text":"I've eaten at this restaurant once for to go service food was decent tried to give it another shot with a close friend because it's close to my home ..... Decided to dine in on a Saturday afternoon pretty quite once we got in service was quick but not so friendly the sushi chef didn't speak?! Got the chicken tempura lunch bento box special ate nothing but the miso soup everything was bland  sushi (spicy tuna) was slightly warm yuck I was so disgusted I paid my tab n left .. My friends first \"Thai food experience\""}
{"text":"Great decor but definitely not authentic Thai. I've been to Thailand several times and the food wasn't even close to what I've tried in the past. Also the service leaves a lot to be desired."}
{"text":"This place has a become a regular in our to-go rotation for lazy weekends.  I have to say that the best stuff on their menu is the curries.  I haven't tried a curry that I didn't like here, although my favorite is the green curry with shrimp because it comes with a LOT of veggies (bamboo, bell peppers, carrot, eggplant).  It's insane how much food they give you.  When I order curry to-go it usually lasts me for 2-3 meals!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that I have been to every Thai basil in the valley. This one and the one on central in downtown Phoenix have the best quality of food and it is consistently good. The reason I am only giving 3 starts is because the past few times I ha e visited this location, the packaging has been off. I always order the garlic eggplant and tofu. This is a sautéed meal topped in a delicious garlic sauce. They put the mela into a carton that you put rice in. The issue you may ask? These cartons aren't meant to hold liquid. My food didn't even make it home before the carton got soggy and the liquid spilled into the bag(pictures attached). Do they do this with curry as well? Just seems a bit strange to me. Would definitely recommend if you plan on dining at the restaurant. Not so sure about take out anymore."}
{"text":"Went there with my family for dinner. Asked the rude condescending waiter how big are the portions, he said individual size. Ok so we all ordered our own food..let me tell you it was way too much , we could've all shared. So we ordered  $40 extra food that we took back to our hotel rooms. Food was good. Service was really poor. Don't be fooled by them saying individual size a family of four could share. And he charged us extra for our drinks.  So pay attention to your check."}
{"text":"Pad Thai is very good. Red curry was way too heavy on the cream. The seafood-vegetable dish was totally bland.
I'd suggest the Thai Elephant down the street a few blocks."}
{"text":"Yeah i am a globe trotter.  Yeah I am a world traveler I do the Tucson to Phoenix thing all the time.  That being said I really dig this place.

The food is solid.  It is super fresh. It has a ton of flavor.  The eggplant will rock your world.  Definitely worth a try.  The service is usually friendly and passable. But I will come back often."}
{"text":"Solid place for Thai food.  The Spicy Basil with Beef was excellent as was the Pineapple Curry with Pork.  The Thai salad was nothing special but the peanut sauce dressing made it awesome!  The only downside was it's mainly for takeout or delivery since there are only two tabes in the joint.  The location at McKenna and Raymond Rd is a little sketchy too."}
{"text":"For the price of the food, we felt like the quantity and quality was not there.  The pad thai was too sweet with little shrimp and chicken.  The green curry lacked any substantial pieces of meat and frankly we felt like it was a vegetable curry instead.  Plus the wait for 2 dishes was over 25 minutes and the restaurant was not even full.  Would not order from here again as it was not good value and mediocre at best."}
{"text":"Average quality Thai food. Nothing superb but the lunch specials are definitely a great deal, and there's a wide selection to choose from."}
{"text":"Thai Basil on University has, hands down, THE BEST Red Curry in Tempe! I was introduced to this location a few years ago from a co-worker and haven't been able to find Red Curry as sweet, creamy, or fresh as theirs anywhere in the Valley! 

While I highly recommend the Red Curry with Chicken above all other dishes; their Green Curry is also excellent and comes in at #2 for my favorite and #3 is definitely their Spring Rolls. The best part about the Spring Rolls is that they come with a very light, sweet and spicy, yet flavorful dipping sauce. I am not sure what kind of sauce it is exactly, but the consistency is a perfect pairing.

Besides the great food, they have very quick service; it's perfect for take out or dining in! Friendly staff and very clean. I highly recommend this location if you're a Curry fan!"}
{"text":"Best asian restaurant I have been to in Tempe. The chicken pad thai was absolutely superb. Not oily, not greasy and everything tasted sautéed and cooked properly. The service was friendly, professional and precise. I will definitely be returning to this restaurant for my Thai cravings."}
{"text":"I've come here several times and I always enjoy it. My favourite dish is the basil chili noodle. The flavours are always good, the staff is friendly and the decor is nice."}
{"text":"Not a fan of Thai food but the place is great. Make reservations before you go. But the food is good I loved the sticky rice with mango! I wish they had more seafood and vegetarian options. Overall great!"}
{"text":"This is a pearl hidden in Park Central. Sort of charming inside but comfortable. Clean, great service, and the food is so wonderfully prepared.  Hard to find as their sign is behind a tree. Just a couple of doors north of the Starbucks. 

Tired of Pei Wei as we are?  Go HERE for better food by far."}
{"text":"This is one of my absolute favorite places to go for lunch and any other time I can get here.  Fast service, great food and low prices you cannot beat for the deliciousness you get!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a good peanut curry or amazing Pad Thai, this is the place! My boyfriend and I go here all the time and we seriously crave this place like no other.
Food is always excellent, good portions, decent prices. Take out or sit in we have always had a great experience. Friendly and fast service! Yum!"}
{"text":"My new favorite Thai place!!  The food here is so good. My favorite dishes are the curry or Thai garlic. These dishes have great flavor and a good amount of spice. I've gotten medium spicy and it's perfect for me.  I've never eaten inside, always take out. The food is prepared quickly and always tastes fresh. The portions are perfect with enough for leftovers. The restaurant is pretty spacious and is always very clean when I pick up my food. The staff is very friendly and helpful. There food can also be ordered on Grubhub."}
{"text":"Whenever I am in the mood for Thai, it's the first restaurant I hit on Bloor (great for people watching! I always see someone I know), there's never a wait, and it's so vegetarian friendly. What's not to love!

I am particularly fond of their lunch special which hovers around $14 (I'm not sure why someone said it is 8-9) and includes lemongrass soup, spring rolls, and pad thai.

Listen. Their lemongrass soup is delicious. Delicious. I will write papers for school in a timely fashion and reward myself with soup. I will buy the soup and sit in my window on a sunny day and watch you walk down my street while I ponder how this is so much lovelier than writing a paper. I bemoan the fact that when I am not in Toronto I can't order this soup.

Whenever I'm up for Thai, whether with a friend or going solo, I always wind up here because it is reliable, amazingly delicious, and close by and you know what?

NO REGRETS except just stick with the pad thai.

PS Get the mango sticky rice (fgkjfhgksfgsd) and iced lemongrass ginger juice (ohhhhh), but skip on the martinis because they are expensive and if you're in that neck of the woods, you can for sure get cheaper martinis a few blocks down. Go to the Lab on Brunswick on a Tuesday night!"}
{"text":"Great food but the waiter didn't ask us about level of spice for our dishes like he did for the other table. Red curry was awesome although lacking any real spicy punch"}
{"text":"Only two stars because the food was pretty flavorless.  The staff was so nice and friendly though.  The food was seriously lacking flavor but the service was fantastic and their prices were great but unfortunately the food was not great."}
{"text":"Yum!

This restaurant is so simple and cute. The pad thai is fresh and delicious, though a little sweet for my personal taste. I suggest asking for a lime on the side to add a little tartness. The red curry is rich and flavorful. The signature Thai Basil dish is also really good - lots of beautiful vegetables and complex flavor.

I highly recommend trying the combination appetizer. The fried sweet potatoes are so crispy and delicious. The spring rolls are a little greasy but really tasty. The fried tofu is very crisp and delicious - goes great with any of the sauces they include with the appetizer. The chicken satay is really moist, and the Thai toast is good, too.

The portions are good and the prices are reasonable. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Definitely a shady place to eat.  Friend had his card swiped a few times and watched the charges on his phone multiply.  They threatened to cut his debit card. They still made him pay cash. Thank goodness he wasn't feeling well, he didn't feel like putting up a fight when the two employees tried to intimidate him into swiping the card again. Definitely a few violations in the customer service department..."}
{"text":"Thai Basil is just okay. I've eaten here more than twice and each time hoping the experience to be better, but my feeling has consistently been... \"it's alright\".

The Pad Thai and Panang Curry seem to always miss the mark. Under flavored, not quite cooked correctly ... I just think there are better places for Thai that suit my palate.

I would consider this a \"push come to shove\" option for Thai."}
{"text":"I miss working in downtown Tempe. My boss and I would go here at LEAST once a week. I won't fail to mention that I now work within walking distance from LGO, Radio, and Chelsea's.and deluxe is only a few miles..... 
The atmosphere isn't that great, and the service is spotty.... (they do offer to go) 
If you go for lunch, either come early or late, don't try to hit it right at high noon, or you'll be waiting (sometimes outside) for a while. 
The thai iced tea is good 
Their lunch specials are well priced and come with an egg roll (which didn't ever have corn in it, but this might be something new) and usually starts off with soup or salad (i think they rotate soup/salad depending on our seasons)
The pad thai is nutty and good. I REALLY wish they had a Green Mango Salad with Dried Shrimp, but...If you don't know what to eat, then try the thai basil (their signature dish); it's always a good fall back if you don't like...... 
THE CURRY. 
The curries. Ahhh - these get their own paragraph. 
I've never been a huge fan of yellow curry (don't like the potatoes...) but their red curry, sweet nut curry (which is red), and green curry are phenomenal. In a class of it's own is the green curry. 
I am in love with the green curry. You can get this green curry with tofu, chicken, beef, pork, or shrimp. I usually get it with tofu or shrimp, but I've had it with chicken and pork, and both are great. 
If so inclined, TOPS Liquors is located in the same plaza. They have a wonderful selection of beer..but that's a different review."}
{"text":"Yum! I love this place. I didn't even really think I liked Thai food that much until this place. Totally vegetarian friendly, inexpensive, fast, and delicious. The signature dish, Thai Basil, is awesome. The curries are too. Every member of our family can find something they like, and that almost never happens for us!

I would probably give them 5 stars, except that one time, my friend ordered her food with extra eggplant, they brought her dish with almost no eggplant, and then when we asked for additional eggplant, they told us it would be $2 extra, which was kind of uncool."}
{"text":"I don't think I have ever given one star!! This place is awful!! I had the Pad SE Ew and it truly was Ewww! Little sauce old stale hard beef! Also had the Thai fried rice, all vegetables very little rice and again stale old beef! Fried rice with little to no rice, strange!! What rice it has  was mushy and no taste! We also had the tab cheese puffs. Again tasteless not much filling. I will never go back."}
{"text":"Best dish of all: Crab Fried Rice. Its amazing! I've tried following chicken dishes and all were good: Thai fried rice, spicy fried rice, pad thai noodles and green curry. Green curry with steamed rice is great. You can suggest the level of spiciness with Thai hot being the extreme and they do make it a lot spicy if you want it to be. There is considerable quantity of food in a dish and one dish can be shared in three or four if ordering multiple dishes. The customer service for us was pretty cheerful, friendly and fast."}
{"text":"Supporting a local business is nice, and supporting a local business that has done so well for itself that it's expanded, heck yes!

Daily specials are a plenty, and most locations have a great beer and wine selection. Happy Hour is 3-6pm... and before that you can get a pretty great lunch special for about seven bucks.

Any Thai novices out there will be pleasantly well fed, and content here."}
{"text":"I've been here over a dozen times and still haven't reviewed it yet. Sort of that \"You don't talk during a meal because it's so delicious\" - thing?

Anyway,

The owners and staff here are so freaking nice. Customer Service is such an important element to dining, that a lot of places overlook, and these folks do it well.

Traditional Thai offerings in a very relaxed, clean (thank you), and simple atmosphere.

This is the only Thai Basil, of the local chains, that makes Pad Prik King and other \"off the menu\" dishes -  so I keep coming back to this particular location."}
{"text":"Really good Thai food. We tried a bunch of stuff of their menu and we're pleased with every single dish. The service was super friendly and very prompt. The place was full on a Friday evening and we were still seated within minutes. 

I would definitely recommend this place to those who have yet to try it out. I would also return for sure!"}
{"text":"Thai Basil's lunch special is out of control. Small soup and spring roll with any lunch main (which really seems to be most of the mains) for under $10. That's right, two can dine on three courses each for under $20. Not bad. Not bad at all...

Food-wise, I had the beef red curry with veg on rice. It wasn't great, the meat was a bit rubbery, but I guess you get what you pay for. My friend's pad thai looked solid, so next time I will go for that. Yes, there will be a next time... did I mention those prices?"}
{"text":"Panang curry (ordered hot on the spicy scale) is to die for. I always go at lunch so the prices are really reasonable. It seems like a lot of the negative reviews (and comments I've overheard in the restaurant) involve people being unhappy with the spice (too spicy, ordered mild and not enough flavor). Thai cuisine, especially curry is spicy. If you don't want Thai cuisine prepared the in the traditional Thai style, you really can't complain that it doesn't measure up."}
{"text":"I had been meaning to try Thai Basil for sometime. I finally did last night. They are open to 10 PM every night, which is nice considering how many Asian restaurants close before 9 PM. I had my usual favorite,  red curry chicken. The chicken was very tasty, and the vegetables were fresh. I like my Thai food on the mild side, and they were able to accommodate me. The server's name was Summer, and she was perhaps the nicest waitress I had ever met at a Thai restaurant.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I had a bad experience with Thai Basil when they first opened and have not been back since. I am really glad we gave them another chance!! We called in our order and it was ready when we arrived 15 minutes later. The place was quite busy with carryout orders, there is really no dine in space. The man tending the front counter was efficient and pleasant even with how busy they were. This was appreciated, since inefficiency was the reason for our initial bad experience. We ordered chicken pot stickers, spicy cashew nut with shrimp, and spicy fried rice with chicken, planning to share. The two entrees were really tasty, the potstickers were nothing exciting. Great heat on the food and portions were a good size.  The one disappointment was they did not include the rice that goes with the spicy cashew nut and we did not realize it until we got home. Since that was the case I gave up half my fried rice to my dining partner.  We both found ourselves wishing we had more food. Will definitely be back, but this time will check our order before leaving."}
{"text":"I went with my boss for a belated birthday lunch. He ordered the pad Thai and a Thai tea and I ordered the pad see eiw with chicken (spicy level-hot). Food came out piping hot and in a decent time. Thai basil always produces great food, however service could be better- they forgot the Thai tea and added it to the bill. He asked for it to be removed as he never received it, the server apologized and removed it immediately. 

Over all great lunch!"}
{"text":"Made fresh daily spring rolls - yum!!  We tried their special - mango red curry.  And a fan favorite - tofu pad Thai.  Both were amazing and really large portions.  We got mild and they made it perfectly unhot!  

We were in the area randomly and found them on Yelp.  So glad we did!! Friendly staff,  clean space.  And the food was incredible!  The veggies in the curry were perfect.  Cooked but crisp!"}
{"text":"Went on an early dinner date (4:30pm) here and I really enjoyed it. There was only one other person in the whole restaurant which was cool to have just us there.  I loved the food. People are always talk about good curry or pad Thai and just look passed a really good sticky rice. Best white and pineapple rice I've ever had. It made the meal. It was so amazing. I will go back. It was very good. I got the green curry and it was top 5 on the curry charts. Wouldn't say it was unreal life changing but v satisfying. Pineapple rice with chicken was also very good. Had s sweet taste matched with some spicy paste. 

Would def recommend and go back. 4 stars because we were the only ones in the restaurant  and so if I said service was amazing and food came fast just seems biased because it wasn't busy at all. But if you would really good service and really fast food come to you go there at 430 on a Tuesday afternoon."}
{"text":"My most favorite Thai restaurant in the town. Special Green Avocado curry and mango curry are my favorite. Also, Fresh spring roll are the best here."}

Green curry-lunch special with tofu

Don't really love the salad dressing though.

Customer service-4/5

Would definitely go again for lunch special."}
{"text":"Thai Basil is my go-to place for Thai food in Madison. I alternate between take-out and delivery (depending on how lazy I'm feeling), and have never had a bad experience. The people who answer the phone and who work the counter are fantastic, and have never gotten an order wrong. My usual order is the cucumber salad and tofu larb, and I often place a double order so that I can have it the next day as well. The larb especially tastes great the second day, when it's had a chance to soak in overnight."}
{"text":"Been to Thai Basil a few times.  The atmosphere is nice however the food is a hit or miss depending on what you order. I'd stay away from the spring rolls and the Pad Thai as they are definitely not as good as most places and did nothing for my taste buds. However, I find myself returning here time and time again for a few dishes. These include, the Tom Yum soup, the panang curry chicken and the coconut fried rice... These 3 are amazing in my opinion and I can't wait to dazzle my taste buds with these 3 flavours again."}
{"text":"DANG. 

I came here with my buddy and we got the crispy sweet potatoes as an appetizer and they rocked our world. 

We also each got the chicken Pad Thai as an entree and it was soooo solid. 

Service was awesomeness and it was super quick.

Plus there is a lunch special for 8 bucks!

I will definitely be coming back here.

{"text":"Walked in at about 6 pm on 2/25 with about 20 people after winning a sticking fighting tournament @Aliante Station about 30 minutes prior.  (Go Mixed Combative Systems!)  After a little confusion and miscommunication, we were seated between 3 tables with little problems.  I usually eat with a healthy approach but since this was my one cheat meal a week, I took the gloves off and threw down HARD.  I personally devoured a chicken satay appetizer, Banzai roll, Boston roll, Beef Panang with white, sticky rice and finished with a banana cheesecake ice cream chased with 2 Thai Iced Teas.  Everything that came to my table was delicious with everyone leaving full and satisfied.  I ended up overtipping due to the fact that I should of made a reservation but oh well.  All good.  Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"WOULD GIVE THEM 10 STARS IF I COULD. Best green curry and pad thai in Tempe! Food is always hot, authentic, made with great ingredients, and priced well. I take everyone here when they visit so they all can experience how delicious it is!"}
{"text":"I thought I was being a trooper when I decided to try \"mild\" Thai spice on my pad Thai and started crying tears of pain with every bite. Turns out they mixed my order up with my boyfriends, who ordered \"thai hot\" spice on his calamari dish, which I'm allergic too and can't swap with. This was our second trip here, and since the first trip was during a lunch rush and we figured it would be better when it was slower. Sadly, it wasn't. Not going to be returning."}
{"text":"I really use to like this place, however, over the past while now...it's been off.
Usually go there for lunch to grab their lunch special and run.  The dishes that I usually order are Green Curry Chicken, Basil Eggplant, or the Pad Thai.
Lately I find that the Lemon Grass soup (small sample sized) is lukewarm and flavourless - too much watering down.  
The curry was also cold and runny all over the plate.
A while back the curry was presented in a small bowl along side their star-formed rice.  I guess in the wake of not wanting to do more dishes, they place the portion of food directly on the plate itself.  This explains why the curry gets cold before serving.  The plate is usually cold and the little bit of food cools quickly over the large surface.

I would suggest they go back to serving the food on proper dinnerware.

The staff here are great and courteous and I hope they will get the food back to where they should be.

Trying to Thai-one-on...(GROAN....!  I know. :)"}
{"text":"Tom kha soup is my new benchmark for comparison. Delicious."}
{"text":"Here on business and had a Thai craving so I stopped by Thai basil. The staff on duty was extremely rude and no type of customer service skills at all. To say the least the smell in the restaurant was very unpleasant, it seemed like they had some type of sewage issues in their restroom that was seeping into the restaurant. Didn't see a letter grade in the front window but from the smell and ambience I can only guess it was a C grade. Good luck to anyone patronizing this restaurant."}
{"text":"I tried the food for the first time! Like their choices of Asian food, a little bit of everything, mild to spicy! Really enjoyed the variety! Will certainly recommend them, plus the service was awesome."}
{"text":"Having moved from Chicago, it's nice to finally find a solid Thai place with good food and a very hip \"Hey-you-guys-wanna-try-a-killer-little-joint-downtown?\" kind of atmosphere. Friendly service and comfortable seating right next to the light rail. The only thing holding me back from that fourth star is the price, which was a couple dollars steep. That keeps me from being a frequent visitor, but not from dropping in every once in a while."}
{"text":"Great lunch place and value for your money. Came with 4 work friends and we loved it. Lunch combos are huge portions so next time we will share. Love it....will be back! Waitress a little snobby but food and value worth it."}
{"text":"Loved this place. We came for a birthday dinner, there were 10 of us, noticed another table for 10 set up . though 'oh nos.... Gonna be busy and food will be slow, dang'.

Not the case, there must be 10 people working in the kitchen because we all ordered something different and everything came at once and was well cooked!!  The other table also ordered at the same time AND almost all the other tables were full!!

Decor, loved it, when you first walk in there's a great wall Stine thing fountain, dark wood with Thai touches classy casual

Noise level : there's music playing its not very loud, to allow for conversation. Awesome.  Note: they play music from all over the world not just Thailand.  

With a full restaurant of talking people we could still  all hear each other.

Food : what counts the most.  I love my dish. I got the tofu with garlic and chilli. It was nice and spicy. Yum! Huge portions!

Staff: everyone was nice. No one smiled though, it was weird

Price: pretty reasonable for the amount of food you get.

All and all thumbs up. Will be back for sure!!"}
{"text":"When it comes to Thai cuisine, the first dish that immediately provokes my foodie thought is the signature, Pad Thai!  For this particular specialty, Thai Basil should be commended for quality, taste, and consistency.  To elaborate, while some places I have had come out overly mushy, the noodles here are soft and steamy, fresh off the pan, but what really brings this dish out is its sweet, rich, glazey flavor along with a fresh mix of crunchy bean sprouts and green onions.  I like to top it off with my choice of chicken that is cooked tenderly good.  [Entrée = Under $10] [Warning: Very filling!]

Pad See-ew is my other go-to dish.  The wide, flat-style, rice noodles are cooked nicely and comes out hot and steamy the way I always like it!  Beef is my usual choice of meat and is cooked nicely holding that beefy flavor.  The big distinction that makes this dish so tasty and addictive is from the pan-fried, eggy flavor. [Entrée = Under $10] [Warning: Filling!]

The service here I would describe as kind of robotic, but true Asian-style.  I come in, the waiter sees you, I tell him/her how many guests and then immediately directs you to an open table followed by their most delicious, complimentary starter salad and ice water.  All of that happens in literally 2 seconds (exaggerating).  My typical wait for my order is around 10 minutes.  The menu is not that extensive but it still boast a good variety from many curry-style rice dishes to (of course) pan-fried noodles.  The decor is very clean and contemporary with booth seatings.

Their salad dressing for the complimentary salad is unbelievable.  Its light, nutty, sweet and extremely tasty.  In fact, its soo good, you can buy a bottle of it to take home!

If you work around Downtown, you can take the Light Rail here but would have to take a 3 minute walk.  Also, Starbucks is located right next door to grab a little caffeine fix.

For the quality, consistency, taste, and reasonable pricing for a lunch during the work week, Thai Basil made it to my 5-star club."}
{"text":"Phenomenal! Their curry is amazing! I love Thai food, and so far, this is one of the better places I have found in Phoenix.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Simply amazing! I have never been disappointed with a dish. The pumpkin curry is my favorite!"}
{"text":"Definitely not authentic Thai food, over priced for low quality. At best it was spicy Chinese food! Food was sent back 3 times and each time our request was not followed! The main dish was $15.95 and didn't even come with steamed rice! Lunch for two cost $61.00 I left hungry and unsatisfied. Management didn't even take off $1. Padthai is to come with coriander, lime and nuts, instead tofu disguised as chicken! Very disappointing!"}
{"text":"The music in this place gets me every time... it is some strange covers of pop songs that are so cheesy that you can't help but love it.

I have never had anything that wasn't good here, I especially love their daily specials (keep an eye out for pumpkin curry!)... otherwise I can usually be found having the red coconut curry or the drunken noodles.

Service is not very good, but the food is amazing!"}
{"text":"First of all me and my friends all met up for 3 couples date. The host greeted us and sat us promptly. We got waters and our drinks. Very quick service. We ordered our food and took about 10 minutes or so to receive it. I ordered a chicken fried rice with curry. I did not taste the curry so I am giving it 4 stars because I think they forgot to add it into my rice.

I did order food to go. I order the yellow curry with rice to go. I could taste the coconut milk with the curry and was not a big fan of the milky taste. I would go again because of the service and prices and happy hour is a plus!"}
{"text":"Average Thai food at exorbitant prices
Basic lunch for 3 
$30 ordered Thai hot....NOT!
Don't waste your money
Not going back!"}
{"text":"Having recently moved to the Tempe area, I've been trying to find my go-to Thai place. To me, this place isn't as good at Thai Elephant. The service wasn't great and the food was okay but not amazing.

I arrived around 2:00pm to try the lunch menu and the place wasn't very busy; yet the two servers weren't very friendly or welcoming. I've never had Thai Iced Coffee (only Thai Iced tea) so when I saw it on the menu I asked if I could try a small sample of it to see if I liked it. The server said no they don't allow samples, which I thought was kind of rude. Later, she gave me a hard time when I asked to add a little more tea into my Thai Iced Tea because it was way too sweet.

The complimentary soup was very sweet and had an unusual but pleasant flavor. Presentation of the food was nice and portions were descent. I ordered the red curry lunch special and the abundance of vegetables in the dish were nice. The curry itself was flavorful but not groundbreaking. I think my favorite part of the meal was the complimentary egg roll which was crunch and flavorful. 

The food here was good but not great, and with the lackluster service, I think I'll go back to Thai Elephant before returning here."}
{"text":"I LOVE thai basil. I've been ordering from them for almost two years now and they have never gotten my order wrong. Food is awesome, love the yellow curry, pad thai, and their thai iced tea."}
{"text":"Good service. Ok food. Not much to really say about it. Wouldn't recommend to friends but Thai tea is amazing"}
{"text":"This Thai restaurant is pretty good. I would have given it a 4 stars but I do not like how they do not give you an actual receipt showing the breakdown of everything. They give you a receipt which they write down what you ordered and then in the bottom they write the total price. They do not write the price of each item and they do not write how much tax was charged. To think that the inside is quite nice, but they're still using a old school method of receipts. I also do not like how some items on the menu do not show the prices.... It makes it seem sketch. I do have to say I enjoyed the food. I got the drunken noodles which was good. The Thai tea was ok. The small Thai tea and the big Thai tea is not much of a size difference. The server was very nice I have to say that."}
{"text":"I ordered Thai Basil delivery through Doordash. Very good Thai food! It was my first time trying food from this restaurant and I was impressed. I cannot say that about most of my experiences with trying Thai food in Arizona (I am a picky eater though). I LOVED the red curry with chicken, as well as the chicken salad and the fresh spring rolls. Their peanut sauce is delicious!

While I enjoyed most of what I ordered, I did not love their chicken satay. Perhaps it would taste better not delivered? I do not know...The chicken texture did not do me it for me. The pad thai also was not fantastic. However, I will definitely be a customer in the future, as I loved most of the entrees/appetizers I tried and I am thrilled I discovered this place (thanks to Yelp)."}
{"text":"Green curry chicken....hope its good....be right back to tell you about it...
Well....It was fantastic! We will definitely be coming back. The homemade salad dressing is so good we bought a bottle before we left."}
{"text":"EEEEEEWWW!  Total disappointment! I can't believe this place has any good reviews... what are people thinking?  I guess I'm spoiled with super delicious Thai food in San Diego. hmmm.... I am in town and found this place on google.  I ordered Yellow Curry (because of the positive reviews) and a small cup of Tom Yum soup.....$17 + change total.  Not only was I totally ripped off, my curry was extremely watered down. There was a crap ton of Tofu (which was the one good thing) and only a few pieces of potatoes and carrots.  The soup was watered down as well and prepared completely different then what I am used to.  This place sucks and I will never go back.  Epic FAIL!"}
{"text":"Some coworkers and I went there for lunch on a Friday. It wasn't super busy. They sat us outside on the patio. When taking our orders, we were rushed and not able to get a drink order in. The signature Thai Basil dish was amazing! However, the service was terrible. We had to walk inside several times to get our server's attention. He rolled his eyes at our simple requests (which would have added more revenue for him) several times and sent another server outside to help us. The attitude from our waiter was too much. Never again."}
{"text":"I love thai basil. Their food is always fresh and comes out fast. They have some of the best curries I've had in the Tempe area.....not too heavy or greasy, just the right amount of coconut flavor and spices! (the eggplant is really good....they pan fry it separatly for guaranteed flavor and no mushiness!)

They also have some rockin' spicy noodles (always a popular dish at our table when we dine with friends) and the pad thai is pretty good too. 

This is probably one of the more expensive thai places (not crazy expensive, just a little higher then others around the corner), especially for lunch....I don't find the specials that special (expect to pay around 8 to 10 a plate). Service is pretty good....we never have dry glasses or anything. I probably helps that this location is pretty small, your waiter can't disappear for very long!"}
{"text":"Thai Basil was a good addition to Park Central. this neglected mall is a ghost town at night. I'm sure Thai Basil can do  good business off the assorted Club Central crowd, as either a before or post happy hour eatery. Open till 9pm on Saturday is good for me too. 

the Menu is typical Thai fare. the spring rolls i really enjoyed. they have yellow corn stuffed in side. i was quite surprised by it. I'm used to cabbage, clear rice noodles and various carrots, but CORN!! it was freaking delish. the dipping sauce was accompanied by a small salad.

i ordered Red Currey (Medium Spice) it was very flavorful..but..medium?. i didn't notice any heat. not like in a mild. but like a missing heat. next time I'm going hot. and i pray they deliver the goods. i want scorching. tongue tingling action here.

my homegirl got Garlic Vegetable with chicken, (Mild) we both figured go weak on this one cause she's not a hot person. and if it was weak. toss on some chili sauce. so..yea chili sauce was added.  the flavors were on point. garlicky and full of taste. not often do you see green beans in Asian food. i think the playful touches add allot. 

like David S.B. noticed in his review. Thai Elephant was much hotter. if these two restaurants are indeed related. i wonder why the flavor variations?? 
the decor is also quite different. there was only one image on the wall. and it looked like a WW2 Era picture of a family member who was serving in the Thai Liberation army or something. (i just made that up)
which is a juxtaposition of most Thai restaurants i have been to which have random Buddhist idols and what-nots. honestly i like the change up.

total on the bill for two entrees and an order of spring rolls was 36.Change which is pretty good.

if Thai Basil and Thai Elephant are related. i think they have little twists that make each place different. i look forward to returning.


there was a party of about 8-9 when we arrived, which at the time we got there. they were the only other people in the restaurant. so i think this place is good for groups...as of now. when this place picks up in popularity..i don't think it would be all that comfortable with a large group..inside. outside will be great. lots of ceiling fans to keep the area cool."}
{"text":"This was my first time here & WOW!!! I can honestly say everything from beginning to end was Delicious!!! I ordered the chicken chow mein lunch special & my fiance ordered the rice noodles with lamb. Each dish was superb! I ordered mine with mild sauce and he ordered his at medium, which neither was really hot, which was perfect! The chow mein came in a big portion which was awesome....especially considering the fact that it was the lunch special. 
We then ordered the Fried Banana & Ice cream for dessert. Let me just say that I told my fiance he had to learn to make this because it was soooooo freaking good! The ice cream paired with the banana had a nice touch since the banana was fried & warm and the ice cream was cold. Very good! The service was very fast, the waitresses & waiters were extremely nice & very patient. We did not feel rushed at all. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I went to Thai Basil by myself today for lunch about 12:30. Ordered Peanut Curry (Panang) with tofu and no broccoli (personal preference) and a thai ice tea.  I got to choose my level of \"heat\" - I said \"as hot as possible.\"The total came to just under $10 and less than 10 minutes later my food was ready.

Panang is one of my favorite thai dishes and its typically the first thing I order when going to a new thai restaurant.  Thai Basil's version of it had a thick sauce, which I love, and the tofu seemed to be grilled or cooked in some way that gave it a nice firm and chewy texture.  The meal also comes with rice (I took mine white) and a spring roll with that spicy clear-orange dipping sauce.  It was delicious.  The vegetables that came with the panang were big hearty pieces that were well cooked, not too soggy or hard.  The thai ice tea was thick and yummy, an excellent way to wash down the panang.  That being said, for ordering my dish \"very hot\" it was not all that spicy.  I'd say it was moderate, but I have a high spice tolerance.

I was surprised to see there was seating available in the peak of lunch hour, and next time I go, and there will be a next time, I'll bring some friends and grab a seat. The seating inside the restaurant is kind of cramped, I had to scoot out of the way to let the waitress's pass when I walked to and from the counter."}
{"text":"decent food and good Thai iced tea...  though just about everything has mushrooms and celery, even if it doesn't say so on the menu and a lot of the dishes are basically the same

BUT have had unnecessary drama there about the thai iced tea (god forbid you ask for no ice). After discussions between four ladies and a whole lot of drama, we finally get our cups only 2/3 full.  We were told that they had to make sure there was enough because it's so hard to make the tea, that it takes them a whole day to make it. That is no excuse, you should definitely NOT portion it out to your customers (especially that early in the day). If it's that hard to make, either don't offer it or make enough. Their service in general could be friendlier and better."}
{"text":"I visit this place quiet often and I always find the food very tasty, I ordered almost everything from Menu and the food is always good. They have friendly staff and service is very quick. My favorite dish is Crab Fried Rice and since it is lunch special they have it for 2 months, I wish they include this dish in the regular menu.  They recently introduced soup's in their menu, will try it someday."}
