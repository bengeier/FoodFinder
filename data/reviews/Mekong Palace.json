{"text":"Best dim sum in Arizona , hands down no competition!"}
{"text":"I've been to a few other places for dim sum, so my opinion is somewhat biased.  For the record, I'm also your standard adventure-seeking gringo, inspired by Andrew Zimmern.

So, the wife and I decided to check out Mekong for their dim sum brunch.  Now, the prices are extremely fair.  There are 4 pricing categories for their dim sum, A, B, C, and D.  All choices A through C are priced at $2.18, while D is priced at $4.95.  Sodas are sold by the can, so we chose to have one can each of cola and we shared a pot of tea.

We're not picky, but we chose not to indulge on the lovely assortments of \"bun\"-type dishes that were presented to us.  Instead, we focused our attention and appetite on the pork, chicken, and seafood offerings.  And boy, we were not disappointed with the food!  Some of our treats included shrimp shumai, chicken and shrimp crispy spring rolls, pork spare ribs with black bean sauce (basically just a serving of pork fat with some bone in it, but incredibly tasty), taro cakes, sharkfin dumplings, and several others.

The servers were attentive, wheeling their cars around to every occupied table in the establishment.  Well, all the servers except for one.  I couldn't help but notice that one server seemed to avoid our table.  At first, I thought it was my imagination.  But then my wife noticed.  In fact, I watched her as she pushed her cart past us while making an effort to look in the opposite direction!  Of course, her cart had the items we were most interested in, so we were quite disappointed by her.  Were it not for that one server, we'd be giving our experience here 5 stars.

I purposely struck up a conversation with one of the other servers, a very pleasant young man, who was managing a cart that had the words \"beef organs\" on the side.  I asked him what he was offering, and when he described it to me, I could not conceal my interest.  He joked with us that he didn't think we'd be interested in his dish.  Well, he was half right....my wife didn't want anything to do with it!  That plate was very interesting.  It consisted of various organ meats, including tripe and liver that I could identify, and several others I could not.  All of the meats were very soft and tender, which is unusual for organ meats.  My wife even tried some (what a trooper).  We should all be glad I'm the one writing this review :)

Another of the dishes we tried was a flat noodle with shrimp.  Slippery devils, these were!  I was having such a hard time picking these up with chopsticks that one of the other wait staff was attentive enough to offer us forks.  He did it so politely that we joked with him to feign our offense, but we were actually quite thankful. The place settings do not include forks (an indication of their cultural authenticity, perhaps?)

Oh, be thankful that there is a menu with pictures of each offering.  Most of the servers do not speak fluent English.  But when you ask them what they are serving, they can point to the picture and you can read it yourself!

Overall, a fun experience.  Plenty of food, at bargain prices.  And before you leave, be sure to take a stroll through Mekong Plaza (the grocery store next door) and take in all the exotic tasties they have to offer.  It's not Lee Lee Market in its size or variety, but then it's also not as overwhelming."}
{"text":"I was there twice with a friend and enjoyed it so much that I went back and brought my 11 year old daughter. I wanted her to enjoy the experience too. Well, that changed when the servers refused to serve us. Each cart skipped our table repeatedly. I attempted to get the attention of our hostess, who apologized and notified the servers. They then looked over at our table and went back into the kitchen. I thought it may have been to restock the carts....but when they returned, they only skipped our table again. It was so noticeable and humiliating. I promptly paid for our tea and left. I've never been treated so poorly.... ever. My daughter asked me why tbey would not serve us....I really didn't have an answer for her....but she had her own suspicions. I had always been a courteous and respectful customer when I was there with my Asian friend in the past and never had any problems.....I was so appalled. No worries, you made your point clear. We were NOT welcome there."}
{"text":"The food was ok, but you should try a different chinese restaurant. The last time I went there was around 7pm, and the food was not fresh at all."}
{"text":"It is a total f_up. Service terrible and took forever to get the dish out. After confronted with the manager they still charge you the same price. Will not admit their fault on food serving."}
{"text":"Great service & food. Waiters/waitresses are very attentive, they will automatically come up an refill your glasses and give you a fresh plate.
Lots of food options to pick from! Also serves good dim sum!

Unfortunately they're under new management, so impending changes might be happening... :("}
{"text":"You get all you want for eating... 

I am indian and love to shop for grocery from this place. It's easy and everything in one roof with low price!!! You get all types of snacks, fruits, vegetable, diary products and masala... Dal chole Rajma... All masala. I think it's a blessing to have this place in AZ.

Happy Shopping"}
{"text":"our favorite place for chinese. dim sum is fun there are little carts that come around and you just pick what you want. a nice way to try new foods. we like the dumplings, duck, soups, bbq pork, noodles, fried rice. we have tried the lobster and the crab on special occasions (valentines day/birthdays) and they are delicious. it is reasonable and we always have leftovers. very fresh food and great flavors."}
{"text":"Went there a few times for dim sum.

The dim sum price was cheaper compare to couple other places. But you pay for what you got. The dim sum quality really is disappointing. They have basic dim sum variety. But nothing special or delicious really stand out.

What kind of service you got for the visit also varies. We have experienced host arguing with manager, manager arguing with waiter, and waiter arguing with the host. 

I think I would rather drive a bit further to go somewhere more consistent and tasted better in the future."}
{"text":"There's a chinese girl at this place named Min Hong, and she gave me one hell of a bad service. She should be fired! I'm going to Phoenix Palace instead of this place because of her! What a B****."}
{"text":"Good dim sum, good service, quick and the food was fresh! Had a great experience!"}
{"text":"Will not be returning.  The dimsum was sub par but the service was good.  However.... without the food being good, good service makes no difference.  Save your money - its worth the trip down to c-fu and needing to pay a little more..."}
{"text":"solid 4 star. Authentic Cantonese food. Service is not bad considered that as a Chinese restaurant.

I wish they could offer more variety on live seafood."}
{"text":"Showed up at 5 before 10 am on Sun morning, and the place was already starting to fill up. First the good: spacious, slightly harried staff were welcoming and quickly sat me down and asked which tea I'd like. My pref is always heung pihn but it never tastes like it in any of the restaurants I've been to here in PHX. Anyway, the usuals showed up in carts. I have to commend the staff who have to keep up in Cantonese, Mandarin, Vietnamese, and English, four times the number of languages that the average local speaks, and they do a good job of that. Had ha gao, siu mai, ha cheung, and sihn juk guen. Now, this is where it falls off a bit. The ha gao were oversteamed and so were disintegrating when you tried to pick them up, the siu mai seemed a bit old, and so too for the sihn juk guen, which was bad being one of the first to sit. In their favor, everything was hot, so, didn't experience any distress. But I was unimpressed. I did spot, heh, some spot prawns which you don't see too often outside of BC, they were pretty pricey, but, live. Later saw a tankful at Mekong Supermarket, still pricey, but wondered if they'd cook them if you brought your own, as other Chinese restaurants do. I'll have to go back for the dinner specials."}
{"text":"We ordered 3 things other then Dim Sum and none one then came out. When we were at the cashier, all they care is whether if we are lying about the orders cause those orders are still on our check. After they checked and make sure it's their fault, there wasn't even a sorry. I will never eat there again."}
{"text":"I went here recently with my Asian friends for Chinese new year for our yearly tradition of dimsums. I really had a very nice time. The food and tea came at regular intervals and I don't think I stopped eating the 2 hours I was there. I do not know the names of the dishes but everything I tried was delicious- the dumplings, turnip cake, noodles, the desserts were some of my favorites. I think I enjoyed more as I went at a very festive time of the year with people who knew what to order. So, if you know even one Asian, tag along with them , let them do the ordering and sit back and enjoy."}
{"text":"I have only been to Mekong Palace just once during their non-peak hours. My family and I ordered their ten course meal, which included a vast amount of different family style entree dishes. I must say that everything that came out was good! My parents had no complaints which is a good thing because they complain about everything especially when it comes to Asian food. The service was very different compared to other Asian restaurants. All the servers that served us were very nice. I liked how they changed out our plates midway through our entrees and refilled our water. I gave four stars for now, since I have only been there once. Definitely give this place a try! They play some awesome American music too!"}
{"text":"Don't know where I should start. Grand opening was on September 17th, 2010. We went to try this new Dim Sum place at the Mekong Plaza as they heavily advertised in the chinese newspapers and were advertising 30% off.

When I got there, the biggest eyesore is that they tried to make their portion of the Food Court as a regular \"Chinese\" restaurant. So imagine the picture of chandeliers hanging in the middle of a food court in the mall. It just looks too tacky, I thought they should've went with a more fast food type Dim sum like they have in San Gabriel, California.

Upon checking in with the hostess, they don't even issue numbers, they only call you by name. So that was already pretty different from how usual chinese restaurant run things. Totally not efficient at all.

Once we finally got a seat, things got worse.

Our \"Har Gow\"/Shrimp dumpling was raw! The skin was thick and clumpy, the shrimp was severely undercooked. We asked them to exchange for another one, and it was still raw. We also had to exchange the shrimp egg roll as it was also raw. Their excuse was that they were too busy and did not have time to fully cook the food. Ok.....so how are the other 100s of asian restaurants able to serve dim sum at a fast pace with fully cooked food? That was probably the lamest excuse.

The trademark \"beef internal organs\" that I always love to order was pathetic. They charged the large price for a tiny little bowl, there were only a few tendons and mostly filled with Daikon. 

The BBQ Pork bun, another staple of Dim sum, was not that great either. There was barely any char siu in the bun, and the exterior of the bun was not fully cooked.

I understand that it is their first operating weekend, but the idea of a nice chinese dimsum place at a food court just doesn't fly in my opinion. They even offer wedding banquets here too. 

I don't think I'll be returning here unless they really upgrade the quality of the food. The idea is definitely novel, but will be a hard sell."}
{"text":"Under new management and very obvious. They broke RULE NO. 1 in the restaurant business which is, when you have great food that customers love, DO NOT replace the chefs when you take over the business. This is exactly what happened just recently and was immediately noticeable when the food came. I knew right away something had happened. Didn't look the same, didn't taste the same, and I couldn't believe that two of the three owners decided to be the new \"chefs\". We know this food from going there many times and loving it. It's gone. Big difference. Here's a suggestion: GET the old chefs back. They were great!! The place itself is great. The servers are great. We really enjoyed this place before the change. But I don't think I 
can go back. This review is NOT about dim sum. This was dinner time. What a shame. I gave it two stars because the servers are great, but....not the food. It's gone."}
{"text":"Yipeee!!! Very good Chinese food in Mesa. Now my hubby and don't have to drive to Phx to have good dim sum! Fast and friendly service!"}
{"text":"All I have to say is Hell I better move to California. Looking at the previous posters talking about how poor this restaurant is and how great the food is in California then I must really be missing out .  I have not dined at many California Asian food places, but I have chowed down at a lot of places in Arizona.  I got to say for me this place is awesome. 

The Food court issue:
Yes  the restaurant  is at the end of the food court.  So what; it's partitioned off except during special events when they open up the whole area as the restaurant. They have a stage area set up so they can have presentations or bands. This is a very smart Idea in this economy. It is maximum use of space. 

The Food:
Seafood so fresh you see it swimming in the tank and can pick the lobster, crab, catfish, ect. ect. Lobster for 9.95, come on, that's fantastic. The sweet and sour ship is excellent. Wanton Soup Excellent. Chicken and Snow pea's outstanding.  Hot Jasmine Tea FanFrickenTastic!!! However, egg roles were a little weak and they did not fold our Mushu Pork for us. 

The wait staff:
English is hit or miss. Most seem very attentive, our water and tea were refilled often.  We did have to ask for forks as I do not like plastic chopsticks. They do not bring all the dishes at once.  Entrees are served as they are finished in the kitchen. 

All in all the food quality is excellent. The wait staff is fast and friendly. The decor is very nice. So I say try it, for the money it is well worth it."}
{"text":"Not a bad place for dim sum. Have been here several times now. Most of the time it's been satisfactory."}
{"text":"This place is the bomb for fried rice!!!! Love the beef fried rice. The roast pork was crunchy, too bad they don't carry Mong Thomas Sauce!!! This is our second visit and the customer service was still great. We requested a table near the aquarium because of son likes to watch the fish: and they gladly fulfilled our request. They refilled my cup without asking. We ordered a dish we thought was what we ordered last time, but it wasn't and they gladly took it away. We tried again, and it still wasn't the right dish. We asked for help and they said it was probably the house fried rice that we got during our last visit. The confusion was that that fried rice wasn't on the menu. But we finally got it right the 3rd time around. We feel bad cause our waitress got yelled at for not getting our order right, she told us. But we tipped her nicely afterwards. They offered us dim sum but wasn't sure if it was free. Overall, you get more food for what you pay for. Con: no refills on sodas. Great place for fried rice"}
{"text":"I ordered Mussels with Black bean sauce yesterday and took some leftover back home. Then today I saw some nasty thing on the mussels shells.
They don't know how to clean Green mussels before cook. Very Nasty!!!"}
{"text":"I'm from NY, so I grew up going to many Chinese restaurants.  I can honestly say that Mekong Palace is a gem in Mesa, AZ for authentic HK style food.  

I've been here many times, for a quick lunch, a late night dinner, and a weekend Dim Sum event.  All of my experiences have been great.

First, let me talk about their BBQ: roast pork, duck, chicken, etc.  The BBQ which you can buy by the pound or get it over rice for lunch is very good quality.   This reminds me of the Chinese BBQ back in NY.  

For dinner they offer a nice selection of options ranging from deep fried whole fish to a steamed fish with soy sauce, scallions ,and ginger.  Also,  I like to order the \"Chow Mien\" (pan-fried noodles) with your choice of protein.  They have basically everything on the menu.  If you don't know what to order, just ask your server, they are very helpful.

Now for my Dim Sum experience they offer your typical \"Dim Sum\".  I was amazed by the selection and quality.

I consider these the standards:

Siu Mai - Pork and Shrimp dumpling
Har goh - Shrimp dumpling
Wu Tao go - Fried Taro Cake
Ha cheung - Shrimp wrapped in rice noodles

......and plenty more!

Also, I have experienced a high level of service during my Dim Sum meal with my friends.  I would ask them if they had a particular dish, and they said they were still cooking them and that they would be ready soon.  To my surprise, when they were ready, the server personally delivered that particular Dim Sum to us.  That act seldom happens at a Dim Sum restaurant partially because the restaurants are usually too busy and because the servers just don't care.  You don't have to worry about that here :-).  Also, the servers speak english, no worries.  

Therefore, come here and experience real Chinese food.  O, did I mention the price is super reasonable!!!"}
{"text":"The Mekong Palace restaurant \"wears many hats\": hot pot, dim sum and canton style dishes. While I don't really recommend the dim sum, the hot pot and other dishes are very good and authentic. Their dim sum was blend and falling apart. But the hot pot offers a wide variety of selection - it is a la carte and not all you can eat, which I'm fine with that as their portions are HUGE.

Their Cantonese style dishes such as Wonton noodle soup, beef fried noodles, Fukien fried rice to name a few are all excellent. They serve practically unlimited rice (which they let you take some of it to go) when you dine in.

2018 Edit
Dim Sum has improved dramatically since I visited previously"}
{"text":"Good service and nice selection of dim sum. Overall great quality, allthough there is less meat in the char siew bao than I am used to from other places. Definitely coming back to this place. Reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Convenient place to eat if you're shopping at Mekong Plaza.  The food is authentic and good, but not great."}
{"text":"This review is only for their dinner menu, which is pretty good Chinese food.  They make some really good veggie, fish, and beef dishes for a fair price.  The wait staff are friendly and pretty attentive.  They always keep my glass full.  I would try to stay away during a night when they have a banquet going on because the food comes out of the kitchen really slowly."}
{"text":"Past 4 years, I come to this place many times, sometime friends invited me, occasionally, I invited them, each time was a pleasant experience.... up until they change owner/ management - a few months ago.

Dim Sum is still pretty good, definitely on par with other restaurant in the valley. On the other hand; Menu items is now a hit & miss; It goes from VERY GOOD to very poor( like..who the FU*K cook this).

There is now several more new eatery added this food court; for the most part; it is very good with reasonable pricing."}

{"text":"One of the best places for Chinese dining. Everything is good, especially the dimsum. They also have live fish that you can pick from, and have cooked and served to you. 

It can get crowded during weekends."}
{"text":"This place is so awesome to go to. Even just to walk around, it's like a little Asian mall. Everything is reasonable priced in the market. And I love visiting the boba shop!"}
{"text":"Bad Service. Order to go Perking duck but can not find sauce and onion in the package."}
{"text":"The best Chinese food I have had in Phoenix.  Have rarely seen this kind of menu that actually as good as when I have been to Hong Kong. Everything we has tried on the menu has been outstanding. Peking duck to taste is a wonderful savory treat."}
{"text":"Poor customer service!  The new female cashier in the BBQ area is extremely rude! She would greet and help people behind me just because they speak Chinese and look Chinese!"}
{"text":"Food was as good & fresh as any Hong Kong Dim Sum. I was impressed with the freshness of the vegetables and light sauces and the Chicken congee was outstanding. Price was very good for the work that goes into making all those little
 tid-bits of heaven. Found Mekong Palace by seeing that Phoenix Yelp Breakfast Club was having an UN-official meeting there, so it must have been tested out to be good, reviews were all good,  no brained and so glad we went. It is inside the mall, really. It takes up a wing of space......interesting it is not enclosed by drywall or short ceilings, a new concept in placement of mall use."}
{"text":"We came with three gift certificates for this restaurant. The staff took the certificates, stood at the cash register trying to figure out what to do, and after appearing to not know what to do, suddenly informed us that  they would not take the certificates because it was a \"holiday.\" My husband is Chinese. It was not a holiday. 

We complained again, and the new explanation was that the place changed ownership and the new owner won't take them. It's funny how the explanation changed. The certificates had no expiration date and no stipulations. These people are rude and deceptive. We will not be back."}
{"text":"We had good dim sum and dinners here.  They are crazy busy at lunchtime on Sunday."}
{"text":"The tough part is showing up late enough that there's fresh items, but showing up early enough that you're not waiting for a long time to eat. We ordered chow fun which came out greasy though the flavors were fine. 
The seating area of the restaurant is basically in a cordoned off area of a mall. There's nothing ambiance wise to keep you coming back but that's not really their thing. 
Overall, not as fresh and a bit more greasy than I would have liked. It's a decent dim sum place, but I likely won't return."}
{"text":"Great value for dim sum! Interesting setup though. It's literally in the middle of the food court and split up with nothing but a few partitions, but the food was great!"}
{"text":"This is the best Dim Sum I've EVER had!!!  If you decide to try it, be ready to come back regularly, because YOU WILL get addicted!!!  Great quality, fresh food, quick service, at a fair price.  The only downside is that most of the people don't speak much English, so there is a language barrier.  So, if you're not seeing what you want on the carts, you may want to ask for a menu, so you can show them.  If you like dim sum, you won't be disappointed with this place!"}
{"text":"We wanted to try Makong Dim Sum since it is closer to our home and we hadn't tried Dim Sum there. We went this morning and had an amazing brunch! No wait and they were very busy, they sat us right away and as soon as we sat down the carts were already coming around. We just kept selecting our favorite dishes and even took enough home to have more for dinner. The food selection isn't as extensive as Great Wall in Central Phoenix, however they have a nice selection and prices are really good. $2.98 per selection for ABC and D is $4.95. We had 4 meals for $30. The service was amazing, I would say better than any place I have been to here. Tea pot never emptied, water glass never emptied...constant attending to used dishes and very available if you had additional needs. We really enjoyed our brunch there and will most likely go there much more often. C-Fu Gourmet is pretty good, but the service prices and selections are a bit to be desired. Great Wall by far is the best for variety and quality of Dim Sum but Makong Plaza Restaurant comes in close 2nd."}
{"text":"If you're looking good customer service, this is not the place to find it. Most places would be considerate enough to at least apologize when they make a mistake. I ordered a roasted duck, which I have to say is the only reason why I put up with the terrible customer service. The cashier took my ordered but failed to give it to the butcher and after 25 mins of waiting, I came up and not only did she not apologize, she just laughed it off as if making me wait 25 mins when everyone else got their order in minutes was a joke. 

Aside from that, 3 stars, as the duck makes up for some of the crap service."}
{"text":"Our niece was visiting and wanted to have hot pot. So we drove all the way to Mesa from Phoenix because of the great reviews. Our experience in one word. Awful. $23 per person!!!flat price for hot pot even though we are vegan and didn't order meat. Service was gruff and inconsistent. Go to Sambue Fondue instead."}
{"text":"Our family comes here very often and the food is delicious, but an issue that I've discovered was that the service isn't too great at dinner time.  I recommend this place to everyone but don't expect there won't be a huge wait for a waiter or waitress to come to your table anytime soon"}
{"text":"Ok so I've had the Dim Sum here 4x and just been too lazy to write a review so here it is. Amazing food, great prices if you go with a group and very good service. The food just keeps coming and the quality/diversity in dishes cannot be overstated. Try the black beef, sweet rolls, tea, and seafood items. The location is great too because it is in an awesome Asian food/general marketplace with shops so after your meal you can wander around for a unique cultural experience. This is definitely a must visit location with friends and a group to have a fantastic eating experience!"}
{"text":"Solid dim sum in a Asian marketplace.  As an out of town visitor, I felt like I dropped into Hong Kong meets Saigon.  The dim sum was pretty good.  Clams in black bean sauce my favorite, beef rice noodle my least favorite.  Service was great.  In the back of the rows, I still had lots of attention.  Head on shrimp also delicious!"}
{"text":"Took my 2 best friends today instead of my usual party of 11+ everything was exceptional and they also had a new coconut cream puff that looked like challah!"}
{"text":"Love this place! This one of those hidden gems you hope doesn't lose its appeal. The Dim Sum is delicious and authentic with lots to choose from. I highly suggest the Peking Duck platter, it's delicious. The best part of this place is the reasonable pricing. I'm already looking forward to going back!"}
{"text":"So the setup is interesting.. since it is the same owner, Canton BBQ and Asian Noodle Kitchen in the food court as well as Mekong Palace all share the same kitchen and more or less the same menu (AND they own Chicken Noodle House around the corner).  So if you were really feeling like a cheapskate or want to avoid crap service, you could just order your dim sum to go and get your BBQ and noodle dishes at the food court side.

Dim sum is served all week, though you might have to order most items off the picture menu during the weekdays.  Food was decent, but seriously dirty teapots at the spouts at several tables I looked at... c'mon, take 3 seconds to scrub off the wall of brown crud that surely built up over several servings... that's how long it took us."}
{"text":"I've been here many times before, and the usual problem is subpar service, but not this time....

Food's usually pretty decent here, but today was full of surprises. First, the tea had bugs in it (see my photo). Second, the sticky rice had a rock in it! I bit into it with full force.. I'll find out if there's any damages when I visit my dentist in a few week. 

I'm very disappointed, I used to like this place a lot."}
{"text":"Best Dim Sum in the Phoenix Metro!  Had a great brunch again today. I love this place!"}
{"text":"They cannot handle the traffic on weekends. If you get there an hour after they open if feels like you have to beg for food. Or the answer you get is I don't know, it's coming soon."}
{"text":"This place is getting worse and worse.  Food quality is just not the same.  We ordered & paid for 3lbs lobster but what we got was like less than 2 lbs.  we eat lobsters all the time. We were cheated for sure."}
{"text":"Went for dim sum today (a Sunday).  Not bad!  They don't have the \"buy X get your next free\" pricing that C-Fu has, but their prices are lower.  All of the employees were friendly and professional, and my water glass was always full.  The front staff (hostess/servers/cashiers) were all excellent.

Pork Dumpling (Shumai): I liked not having mushrooms in them, but they didn't seem to have the yummy whole shrimp C-Fu's has.  Still, solid.

BBQ Pork Bun (Cha Siu Bao): Served cold, sadly.  Decent, but not great.  I've tasted many better ones.

Sugar Cane Shrimp: Delicious!  Somewhat oily, but plump and juicy.  I was so happy they had these today, and at a price better than C-Fu!

Rice Cake: I think the server referred to it as \"white cake\", but it's the plain, sweetened triangular cut one.  Smallish serving, but with a good texture and sweetness level.

Custard Tart (Egg Tart): This unexpectedly stole the show!  The pastry was supremely flakey and buttery, and the custard was sweet but not too heavy.  I usually prefer my custard tarts chilled, but this was really good.  We were almost tempted to order some to take with us, but resisted!  (Bought daifuku mochi from the market instead.)

I had a taste of a warm tofu in ginger syrup concoction which wasn't bad but just wasn't my thing (lunch companion loved it).

Parking can be a nightmare, with many inconsiderate (or just unskilled?) drivers.  There was a small wait, but they went through the numbers quickly as we were before the big rush (number 9...they were in the late 50s or 60s when we left I think).  They could really use those buzzers than restaurants like Cheesecake Factory and The Habit use to notify you when your table is ready.

The ambience is okay, but a little off.  Chandeliers, decent chairs, and a fancy stage (blocking the windows), but it still looks like a food court.  I'm just used to the opulence of C-Fu, so this came off as a little \"cafeteria\" to me.

For some reason I really loved their water glasses.  They're tall, slender, cylindrical, and very classy.

Overall this restaurant offered good food, good price, and is a nice dim sum option!  The parking lot was very busy, so I wouldn't really worry about the location being in a less upscale part of town (by Tricity/Riverview/the old Levitz)."}
{"text":"Always good!!
Go there at least once a week my favorite spot for having dimsum n hanging out with my family!.."}
{"text":"A nicer restaurant with chandeliers and newer furniture. The favorites of the night were the steamed fish, pepper beef, and the red bean dessert. Everything else was kind of underseasoned and bland (fried rice was just oily, but not fragrant and spiced, and so was the bokchoy). Service is a little awkward. They always reach across your plate to place things instead of turning the lazy susan."}
{"text":"Came here from Tucson. Service was alright but that's expected of a dim sum place. The lau sha bao was a disappointment. Dim sum was mediocre. Except for the tofu fa, it was good."}
{"text":"The best sampan crab and fish anywhere that I've ever had in the United States totally totally awesome if you're looking for true authentic great tasting excellent price great atmosphere friendly service this is the place to go"}
{"text":"On a Saturday or Sunday, dim sum aficionados flock to Mekong for brunch; in other words it's always packed, which is a good sign in my eyes! I've been here a few times and while I think the food is tasty, (fried noodles, shrimp and pork dumplings, hot green tea-yum!) service can be hit or miss. Some days the ladies with their carts are swarming our table, and other times I've needed to flag them down. So, if you don't mind occasional mediocre service, but you want some good dim sum, this is a place for you."}
{"text":"Been here a few times before and still the services is really slow, we ordered our drinks 20 min ago and still waiting. Our soups are coming out right now though so I guess that might be a plus...Plates on the table next to us has been sitting there a good 15 minutes before someone came to clean it up.
Food on the other hand is always delicious, choice of different flavored soups, and you can make your own doing sauce."}
{"text":"I have been coming to this Mekong seafood restaurant for years. They have changed to a new owner. I had my wedding reception hosted on thanksgiving eve. I had about 50 guests, the restaurant charged me 530/table plus 18% tip. I paid $300 deposit in advance. On the day of my wedding, there was only one server took care of 50 guests, we asked the restaurant for hot tea, apple cider opener for many times, but just couldn't  get their attention. The service was terrible, the food were cold by the time they were served on the table. Two days later after my wedding, I realized that they charged me for the full price, even though I had paid $300 in advance. I went back to the restaurant with my husband to talk to the restaurant manager named Jun. He apologized and gave me back my deposit. If I never remember my deposit they will never give me back my deposit. I also complained how bad the service was. The restaurant still charged me $600 service fee. Few days later my guests told me that the fish that served on my wedding were frozen fish, which I paid extra for live fish. I went back to the restaurant for dim sum and  also complained to the restaurant manager. He pretended he was on the phone, told me to wait a minute he would come back to talk to me while he was walking out of the restaurant. I waited in my table even after my family finished dim sum. I saw the manager was back to the kitchen, but he was not coming back to my table. I figured he was trying to avoid me so I left the restaurant. I am warning everyone who is going to have a party at the Mekong seafood restaurant, this place is not running properly, over priced, terrible service and food quality is downgraded for what you paid for. I am very disappointed and upset."}
{"text":"This review is based on my experience with their dim sum. I came here for a Sunday brunch. This is prime time dim sum time. I have had dim sum in many cities including Boston, Atlanta, Orlando, Memphis, and Westminster. This place had awesome customer service. I have never been to a place that has refilled my water and tea more than this place! Love the service! The food. Maybe it was an off day. I was tasty but it wasn't the wow you'd expect. Dim sum carts steam the food so once placed on the table it's hot and ready. I didn't see it. Also the had two bottles on the table labeled \"soy sauce\". Surprise surprise one was definitely not soy sauce. It's vinegar (same color as soy sauce here). This place gets packed so I thought I would be getting some legit dim sum. If you're looking for a great dim sum place, I highly recommend China King in Chandler."}
{"text":"First visit to Mekong Palace.  I hadn't realized that they did dim sum so I was excited about that.  
We ordered the salt & spicy shrimp from the dim sum cart and two other dishes from the regular lunch menu ( fish and veggies, and roast pork).  Both came with white rice.  
You need to know that they don't serve brown rice so if you are thinking about health, you have no choice but to eat the white rice or none at all. The fish and veggies was fresh and tasty.  The roast pork was the right combination of meat and fat although the skin was not crackly, a requisite to roasted pork.   
The salt and spicy shrimp (8 beautiful large ones) came with heads  and all which is not unusual in an asian presentation.  It was a good buy at $6.95.  But it was not spicy at all.  The 4 or 5 specs of jalapeño did not do the job.  
If you order this shrimp dish, you need to know that along with the head and the body you are also eating the uncleaned intestines.  I did my best to pull out the string of greenish-black entrails.  I wonder if their other shrimp dishes also serve the ca-ca with it.  
The lunch prices were reasonable and we were served quickly when we arrived at about 12:15.  The wait staff was efficient and friendly.  
Still trying to decide whether a return visit is warranted."}
{"text":"Since most of the Chinese places here in the valley are not that great this place was a pleasant surprise for the food.  The restaurant itself is really just half of the food court cordoned off to segregate some tables for the Mekong dining area.  They have fish tanks of live seafood you can order which is pretty neat.  The menu is pretty giant and they have a good sized selection of vegetarian food.  The vegetable with black mushroom dish I had was very good it just took a really long time to come out.  My buddies's peking duck came out about 10 minutes before mine.  I'm not really sure what happened. Our waitress was very nice and helpfull with the menu and our questions about the food before we ordered.  So for having a pretty long wait and the fact you are basically eating in a food court they are a solid three and it's a pretty fun place to eat."}
{"text":"Worst Chinese food/dinner in town. Our pork belly dish was a reheat(part of the meat was cold!). Sizzling oyster plate was not sizzling at all and only warm/hot. The only dish that was good was the white chicken. Never coming back again!"}
{"text":"Make sure you ask them how their Peking duck is made to order. I order a WHOLE PEKING DUCK to have for my thanksgiving meal with my family. Apparently they make their different with only half duck worth feeding 2 people then the rest is minced with lettuce wraps. That isn't what I wanted. Then had to go thru a process to get a manager just to get a roasted ducked. They need to update tire menu with a better description"}
{"text":"Really good dim sum! Has everything I like BUT they take forever to make their rounds. And they never have ha gao on deck? Really?! They need more people on carts."}
{"text":"Nice place to go to the Asian market and also the filipino food in wholly grill as well as the dimsum!"}
{"text":"Very very good. The Peking duck was awesome. The whitefish was delicious. All around a very good Chinese meal. Best we have had in a long time. We eat dimsum here a lot and very much enjoy it but dinner was wonderful. Will be back for sure!!"}
{"text":"I eat here every other week for dim sum and also order take out for dinner when I'm too tired to cook. The dim sum is delicious and authentic. For people complaining about service; honestly if you're having trouble ASK A WORKER WHO SPEAKS ENGLISH. You're eating at an authentic Chinese restaurant where some workers do not speak English well. The service is fantastic, quick and courteous. If planning to go over the weekend for dim sum make sure you're ready for a 15 minute wait minimum (depending on party size) because that's how great the dim sum is!!"}
{"text":"I guess it is as good as it gets in fresh swimming in the tank Cantonese seafood and dim sum restaurant in the desert.  It is in the curtained off end of an Asian shopping mall but it works.  The menu has many helpful pictures.  Come early for dim sum on weekends because it can get crowded."}
{"text":"This place ranks right up there with some of the best dim sum places I've been to.  It's located in Mekong Plaza where there are many Vietnamese restaurants and a grocery store as well.  It essentially took part of the mall and put tables there.  There is a more private banquet area as well.  It gets crowded pretty quickly.  One time, I got there early and was seated without any wait.  Another time, I had to wait about 20 min.  They have a pretty efficient system where they hand out a piece of paper with numbers on it and when the table is ready, they will call your number.  I know this place is authentic because it is overflowing with Cantonese people.

Once you sit down, the carts will start to come.  When it is crowded, it can take a bit for them to come around.  The variety is good.  All the familiar and usual stuff is represented.  All of them tasted pretty fresh and tasty.

Overall, I like this place better than Phoenix Palace."}
{"text":"This was my first time here and I was most impressed. Wide variety of hot and fresh choices as well as an attentive waitstaff. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"My husband and I came here around noom on a Saturday afternoon. The restaurant was busy, but it's typical for a weekend day. 

I didn't mind the wait, but what I didn't appreciate is that we were seated in one of the rooms to the side of the main dining hall and the cart servers only came around 3 times. One cart came around twice and the other came by once.  We were limited to only a few items (I've been here before and know the array of items they serve). 

After we realized that no one would be coming around anymore, we just asked for our check, paid and left. 

It would be nice if the restaurant had some sort of plan to their madness. The carts should have a route in which they take in order to the ensure that all customers receive the same level of service and food options."}
{"text":"Never even got to eat here. Friends wanted to bring me here while in town and it was busy, which is fine. We were given a 15 - 20 minute eta and we're starving but we're willing to wait.  After the 30 minute wait I went up to ask for an updated eta and easy tel old two parties were ahead of us and it would be a few more minutes. I mentioned the previous eta given half an hour before and was told verbatim \"in cannot control how fast people eat you're gonna have to wait a little longer.\" No apology, just 100% annoyance, so of course I left.  If I was given an accurate estimate I would have been fine with the wait or we could have left and not wasted each others time. And even with an inaccurate initial estimate, some courtesy would have kept us waiting, or at least willing to come back later. Worst customer service ever."}
{"text":"Very good flavors. Would have liked a bigger selection  of steamed dumplings. Stand in line to pay if you're in a rush."}
{"text":"The food was really good, but get there early. It is super crowded and chaotic on a Sunday morning"}
{"text":"The best pork and shrimp shumai I've ever eaten!  I also enjoyed the baked pork buns.  The noodles are pretty good as well.  5/5 stars for the food!

The service is what you would expect for a Chinese dim sum restaurant..pretty inattentive and not very friendly.  But it was very busy when I went and I think the servers were doing their best to keep up with all the customers. 

Although my water was never refilled, and they only allot 1 napkin per customer, and it took a really long time just to find a waiter to pay, the food is exceptional.  I would come here weekly if I lived closer."}
{"text":"This place is pretty fantastic on the value based scale. They are cooking up some HK style delights that rival local California chinese restaurants. They even have the crappy service down to a T. Actually the service wasn't that bad, they did give us new plates during the meal, which is kind of a classy move.

The highlights included the lobster in ginger and scallions, peking duck, oysters in black bean sauce steamed on the half shell, and that fatty pork hot pot (the menu said \"Pork Hock in red bean sauce\" or something). The pork was stupendous, it literally melted in the mouth, the fat part that is. 

Prices were very reasonable. We ran a tab of about $18 a person out the door with tax and tip, and we ordered the gourmet stuff, not the regular stuff.

The mall is nicely decked out with sumptuous tile floors, and it's kinda  a novelty to dine on upscale chine food inside a strip mall (the restaurant has no walls, just partitions to separate u from the mall).

The hood is a bit rough, so make sure you are taking advantage of the new concealed carry law, and pack some heat in the small of your back. Actually, a shoulder holster might be better, cuz your pants will get very tight after the huge meal.

Your Kong or Me Kong? MEKONG!"}
{"text":"Loved it! Took the recommendation from a fellow yelper. The restaurant is basically in a blocked off portion of the food court - no permanent walls. The service was maybe a little slow but good. The food tasted delicious and portions were large. Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Awesome dimsum in AZ. Authentic. Not tamed down for the average Arizonian which is why it probably tastes better :P Service could be more organized but as long as the food is good, it's okay."}
{"text":"Disgusted that they serve shark fin soup. http://ocean.si.edu/ocean-news/shark-finning-sharks-turned-prey

They deserve none of our business."}
{"text":"Mekong Palace Hot Pot was a nice find, tucked in the side of the restaurant. Ive been in half a dozen times, and it stacks up against Tien Wong Hot Pot any day of the week. Less Expensive with a better selection of raw ingredients and a nice flavorful Szechwan Broth.

My full review is available at http://forkvsfood.com/?p=213"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem of AZ. I love the dim song? How do you say it? Also a supermarket with great selection and prices. The hanging duck is a favorite here, and def a cultural experience for non asians. Check this place out."}
{"text":"Been here multiple times for both dim sum and dinner. For dim sum, the food is great and they have all the selections you would ever want. They have the staples like siu mai and ha gao, while having other selections. They also have BBQ pork buns, chicken feet, spare ribs, calamari, and entrees that you can order during dim sum times. Everything is great and cooked well though I did knock it down a star because the food cart availability can be hit or miss (the dining area is large and there doesnt seem to be a pattern that the carts are pushed). Dinner-wise, I have only ordered the set meals for larger groups and the food is okay. I would recommend the dim sum during brunch/lunch hours because it is a unique experience and one that is also very tasty."}
{"text":"This place is both authentic and delicious. Whether you get the dimsum or order platters, you can't go wrong! This place is a hidden gem."}
{"text":"Food quality is very good and well cooked. Not overly greasy as some dim sum places are. Very pleasantly surprised."}
{"text":"The BEST dim sum in Phoenix by a wide margin. 

There is no one remotely close. Great Wall is starchy and tasteless by comparison and they are #2. The other east valley places like C-Fu and Phoenix Palace are too unpredictable - ok served side by side with mediocre and ok days vs. really bad days. I'd given up dim sum in Phoenix. 

I will never eat dim sum anywhere in AZ again. 

Superior pork/shrimp shumai. Superior Barbeque pork buns. Great shrimp dumplings. Great fried shrimp balls.  Great shrimp rice noodles.  Superior rolled bean curd. 

Wonderful experience. Wonderful service. Can't wait to dive deeper into the place. We are dim sum aficionados and this has made our week."}
{"text":"Most large Chinese restaurants that serve dim sum have lousy service and Mekong Palace is no exception. I arrived early to get a takeout order on a weekday, around 11:35, and it took over 15 minutes waiting in line just to order, with only 3 others in front of me. They wouldn't tell the customers to stand aside while they waited for their orders so they could help other customers. I finally ordered around 11:50 and sat down at a nearby table. 15 minutes passed, then 20, then 25.... I watched as people who came after me got their orders. After 40 minutes, I finally asked the lady at the counter for status and what do you know: my order had been sitting there and no one had done anything about it. She just handed it to me and said nothing, no apology or thank you for waiting. It shouldn't take nearly an hour to get takeout. I won't be back."}
{"text":"i'm not a fan of their chicken feet, which is rather flavorless, and the cartilage isn't cooked to fall off the bone. the way it's cooked here almost triggered a bit of a gag reflex. i prefer the ones served at china buffet king. and their pricing for dimsum is all over the place...$5 for gai lan?"}
{"text":"This dim sum place is just okay. The dim sum was good but not super delicious. I've had better at other places in the area. There isn't many carts going around giving new food or it's usually the same dishes on the carts, so I think they should bring out more carts with different dishes. We had to keep asking for food because the food wasn't coming around. There was a long wait when I came on a weekend late morning."}
{"text":"They knock it out of the park today Shrimp toast wow the first time I have seen it there ...But something I have been looking for 4 yearsusually don't go on the weekend but that will change many more treats to come!"}
{"text":"Coming from Southern California, I have pretty high standards for Dim Sum. I was passing by Phoenix on my way to Albuquerque and decided to get some dim sum, as the Valley is the last bastion of Chinese food before I head east. I honestly didn't know what to expect and I was pleasantly surprised.

First of all, the prices are very very reasonable. You cannot even get $2.38 for practically all items (except for large specialty items) in Orange County or San Diego. You'd have to go to New York, San Francisco, or the San Gabriel Valley to find dim sum cheaper than what you find here.

Secondly, the quality is pretty good. The shui mai was tasty, even if it wasn't great looking. The clay pot rice with spare-ribs was pretty good. The bowl of stewed tripe was decent, albeit a bit smaller in amount than I would find in LA. The only big disappointment was the fried sticky rice, which came out a bit dry.

Service was fairly decent when I was there, much better than the average in SoCal, which can range from tolerably forgetful to disgustingly rude. Sure, the service isn't the friendly service I would get when I go to a nice sit down Italian joint, but I'm also not expecting that.

Bonus, they do well in decorating a space that's essentially an end of an indoor strip mall pit. I'll be back when I drive back west towards home!"}
{"text":"Came at 215pm. Totally disappointing!! More worker cleaning up the entire place than serving food. Pathetic 2 food cart moving around with only limited bread or deep fried stuffs.  Seems like they have more cleaning cart than food cart.  Ate 3 miserable dim sum and better get out of here cos the smell of the cleaning cart is damn disgusting!!! Oops...gotta to go....looking for place to puke now."}
{"text":"My sister and I both told our mother that we did not want to come here for lunch. There's really nothing special about this place. I'd much rather go elsewhere for dim sum. Found a hair in my tripe and there was a very small selection of dishes. The baked BBQ pork buns were tasteless and I didn't even get my favorite dim sum pastry - the egg custard tart. When we wanted to order dishes off the regular menu (due to the lack of food available for dim sum), a man who I believe is the manager walked up and told us that the kitchen did not have time to make our dishes. He said it would be at least an hour before they could cook anything for us because they were busy making dim sum. I couldn't understand how they could be busy when there was nothing coming out of the kitchen. I have to add that this guy wore a button up shirt and a tie. His tie was tucked into his shirt in between some buttons near the bottom of his shirt - so unprofessional. Then again, what was I expecting from a man who could not really speak English and offered nothing but horrible customer service.... 

Got a plate of roast duck and it came with a sweet and sour sauce... Never in my life have I been to a restaurant that paired sweet and sour sauce with roast duck. 

We won't be back to eat here again."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service and nothing great about the food. Our bill was pricey and they treated us badly. Only one guy waiter made an effort to do his job correctly, our other server was horrible. Told us to shoo our plates in order to make room for setting the food items and even told one of our guests \"she's too busy to be serving us, ask someone else\". Only giving it 2 stars because it's a clean and spacious environment, and because of that ONE person who was actually being nice. We had to stand up multiple times to get their attention, no one was attentive to our needs and no one offered to refill water."}
{"text":"Terrible service. We've been here a couple of times and waited over 20+ min. each time. First time we ere seated and given a glass of water then the waiter disappeared for at least a 25 mins. So we got up and left. The next time we ordered to go, and no one ever bothered to help us. Also, Everything we ordered they got it wrong. Gave this place a couple of try's and wouldn't hurry to come back. Or ever come back at all."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a takeout noodle dish, rice noodles with shredded duck.  Too salty and greasy."}
{"text":"This place was converted into a Chinese restaurant after what seems like the building owners being unable to lease out more of its food court stalls.  The hot and steamed dishes here are good. Chicken feet actually stood out to me as very good.  As for the other dishes, you should only take if fresh. Some items have been sitting out for a while, and you can't tell until it's already on your table and you dig your chopsticks into cold or stale food. That is one of my biggest turn-offs at dim sum places. They also need more carts going around when busy. Ask for hot mustard to mix with the chili oil, soy sauce, and vinegar. 

For Phoenix dim sum, my latest ranking from best to worst  is Great Wall, Phoenix Palace, Mekong, then China King. I'd go here if people didn't want to drive down to Chandler or out west to Great Wall."}
{"text":"The singer for the  restaurant  was poorly posted.  Table were very close to each other. We tried  their appetizers  , it came out cold and was salty. We had their fish soup which was very good . Nice and hot . The duck was OK . The skin was not as crisp  as I would  have liked it the lobster was salty and tasted rubbery, probably  not that fresh . Mayonnaise  shrimp  was also overcooked  and some of the walnuts were burnt. The service was good but dinner took over three hours"}
{"text":"What can I say ? Dim sum great Dim Sum! Really good but I've had better! The bbq is really good as they sell whole hogs & ducks...lots of veggies and dumplings & good shrimp dishes...desserts were lacking..tea was kinda watery...I love hot tea! Great ambience!"}
{"text":"I've been going here since 2012ish for dim sum and it's literally just plain and simple to the point dim sum. If I don't really feel like driving all the way to Phoenix to go wait 45 minutes for a table at Great Wall, I usually resort here. It's not bad, but it's certainly not the best I've had. From what AZ has to offer it's decent. Large seating area and open space create routes for cart pushers to maneuver around. My go-tos are pretty standard here; siu mai, har gow, shrimp rice noodle, bbq pork bun, and sometimes taro cake and an egg custard bun. Though, commonly in dim sum  restaurants there's going to be what I call \"equally curving\". Usually they'll come up to you offering what they currently have in their cart, so if you don't want any, curve em. But then again they can also curve yo ass by not even looking at you and walking past your table. Pretty common. Sometimes they'll speak Cantonese to me like I know what they're saying, pretty normal. So expect to be skipped at times. I remember the water here was absolutely delicious. But that was long ago. What I can say is that if you're looking for a place to eat dim sum on the east valley, I can say this is a good choice. Keep in mind this place can get busy. So go inside and get a number to be called on instead of waiting for your other friends to come through and end up waiting even longer. Be a team player"}
{"text":"Yummy, who doesn't love dim sum, roaches and  flies?
I had dim sum here once before and liked it until I just saw the 5/22/2012 Maricopa restaurant violations on the news.  Mekong Palace got 16 violations.  Gross!

{"text":"their dim sum is so so. i do come here when i want dim sum but if i wanted to work harder for better food id drive somewhere else. they do have good food that isnt dim sum tho. i frequently come here to order hainan chicken and their roast duck over rice. it is a good portion and very delicious. they also make it really quick so if i order to go, i dont have to wait very long there to get my order. they speak english very well here and i have never had them get my order wrong when i ask for substitutions and add ons. i am very pleased with the service here as well. you can see all the hanging chicken and duck in front as well as see them cut up the chicken and duck too!"}
{"text":"Dim Sum at Mekong is amazing. I love this place! It is a cheap place to feed your friends and family.  We used to go to Phoenix Palace, but I think we've decided that our favorite Dim Sum is at Mekong.  I would recommend it to ANYONE!"}
{"text":"Been coming here for years.  Dimsum is up to par, wait is not as long as Great Wall, so we tend to hit this place up more often than Great Wall.  Service is good for a Chinese restaurant standard."}
{"text":"This place is just AWESOME! We found it by accident and are extremely glad we did. Following an hour long Massage in the same Plaza we went inside Mekong Plaza, an indoor shopping center catering to Asian restaurants, market and other retail stores. We found Mekong Palace and had a GREAT meal! 2.5 pound lobster (from their tank) with ginger and scallions, fresh oysters in black bean sauce, Gai Lan, rice, tea and dessert for $40.00!! The service was great and we were made to feel at home. We went back the next day for Dim Sum and again, we were thrilled with EVERYTHING!"}
{"text":"I have only been here for dim sum during lunch on the weekdays, however it seems like this restaurant gets extremely busy on the weekends. Considering that there are only a few dim sum options in the area that isn't too surprising to me. The food has been mostly hit or miss as far as the dim sum goes. I enjoyed the Shu Mai the best and was definitely better than what I was expecting. The Har Gow was just okay and the sticky rice wasn't very good. Sadly the rice was too hard which it should be soft as with other places.

The service has been adequate to good which is better than what I was expecting. Granted I only came here when it was slow but they managed to refill my water on a few occasions and the carts came by within a few minutes of me sitting down. Other than that the service is pretty much as what you would expect at other dim sum establishments. I suppose it all depends on when you dine in as your mileage may vary.

While Mekong Palace doesn't have the best dim sum...it was mostly good enough for me. I just wish that the food wasn't as hit or miss from what I experienced."}
{"text":"The food here is good and plenty of choices to select from. I have been a happy customer for  a few years. But today when my sister went to pay the dim sum bill for 9 people, they calculated to $130. my husband felt that was a bit high for 9 people. So he asked how many dishes we ordered that resulted in this total. The cashier recalculated and then she said there was a mistake it was only $96. 

Well next time I will be mindful of this and do some math first before paying just so we don't get scammed. I hope this is an honest mistake and not their business practices trying to charge big table more $$$."}
{"text":"DON'T EVEN WAIT IF YOU'RE HUNGRY, YOU'RE GOING TO REGRET THE WAIT!

I don't even know what's worse the dim sum or the service around here. Please tell me. This incident isn't the first but the second. It seems that the management believes that one cart can feed the entire table. Well I'm telling you, it CAN'T. 

I understand it takes time around for the carts but it doesn't take 20 dang minutes. This didn't just occurred to my table but as well for others near me. We had to go up meaning stand up and get our food. Funny part, they legit only had two carts roaming around while I see a bunch of filled carts in the back. No, they didn't have short of staff working. The rice noodle rolls aka CheungFun was made frozen before. Sorry to break it to the CheungFun lovers. A bunch of the dim sum isn't fresh. Some would even stick on the container. Annoying. We would ask them for a certain bun dish, they said it would take some time to steam so I'll place your order in right away. We asked multiple employees. But, no one placed the order in at all. My family was so upset and hungry. #HANGRY 

The service here seems to get worst each visit. We couldn't wait any longer for these carts to come by to our tables so we decided to pay and leave. I knew paying here would be horrifying because they have a long line near the meat. But we decided to pay in the front where there was a REGISTER. The guy was like \"No, you can't pay here, you need to go over there\". Wow, when I thought I couldn't get out of here ASAP. A lady came moments later and rung me up where the guy told me I couldn't pay here. Like seriously, what are you doing standing here picking your nose doing nothing? 

I would not recommend this place to anyone who is a DimSum lover because this place would destroy it. The food service is not worth the waiting. I would not be returning after this experience twice."}
{"text":"Inside the mekong palace there is a separate area to the side that is actually a small Hot Pot restaurant.  While the restaurant area is fairly small they made it very functional, each table has two burners built so that everyone can have their own broth. They had a great selection of food to choose from (from your typical sliced beef to razor clams) after you order you walk to the front and they have a table that is just for all of the sauces you can mix yourself. They gave you so many options and it was nice to be able to make more than just one sauce. The meal turned out great and the service was good  Overall I was pretty impressed, it reminded me of having a family dinner at my mother in-law's house. So if you are looking for a good place to enjoy hot pot without all the troubles of doing at home but just as good make sure you check this place out."}
{"text":"Not a very glamorous market place but it has almost every Asian food/ingredients that you will need to make your cultural cuisine.  Note that it is always very busy and that people aren't the most courteous when navigating through aisles, so just be a bit patient here.  I do think it is a bit difficult trying to find certain ingredients if you're not familiar with the area.  That have sections for different countries depending on their popular cuisines, but then they also have sections for different types of ingredients.  So be prepared to walk in circles.  They do have small rolling hand baskets so that you can easily cut through large crowded areas instead of having to use a shopping cart, which can cause a lot of traffic.  
Don't be hesitant to ask someone a question if you're a bit lost, but also try and be patient and most of the employees may struggle with the English language.
All in all this is a great place to get all your Asian cuisine needs!"}
{"text":"The last time I had Hot Pot it was in Taipei and it was 2009. Clearly I was due for a repeat. Since my China days are over, I had to rely on my friends to take me where they thought the most authentic stuff was in Phoenix, so all 10 of us gathered at Mekong for some Hot Pot goodness.

Here is my easy guide to eating Hot Pot at Mekong.

ORDERING
Sharing is Caring!!  Since Hot Pot is all about sharing, the hard part about it is the strategy. The bigger your party, the harder it will be to coordinate. Groups of 4-6 are ideal. 10 is just a mess. Make sure you all figure out what you collectively want to eat (everyone likes meat? Ok, a couple portions of meat. Only 2 like mushrooms, Ok only 1 serving). Otherwise if everyone fills out an order card with their personal preference you will end up with 1) too many leftovers, 2) a giant bill

PICKING FLAVORS
Go a little past your comfort zone on flavors. A big/spicy/tasty broth is good as you will not be drinking it, but just dipping your sides in it. The stronger the broth, the better the flavors of your sides will be. Also, go above and beyond when making your dipping sauce. Mix and match! Spicy soy sauce mixed with satay, sesame seeds, garlic and cilantro is a good base. Again, you're not drinking the sauce, just dipping your cooked goods in it. The stronger, the better!

COOKING YOUR STUFF
Think like a chef. Not everything will take the same amount of time to cook. The meat will take 10 seconds (in-out-done). The taro will take the longest. Dumplings will take a while to cook, while bok choy, greens and some veggies will be faster. Noodles will also be pretty fast so check often. Also, don't over boil your broth! you have the temp controls under the table, so pick a temperature where you get steady heat and bubbles without making a giant mess and overcooking everything. Experiment! 

EATING YOUR STUFF
Share Share Share. Pass along the sides, try everything (coagulated blood, tripe, fish balls, you name it). If you really want to take some leftovers home, I suggest you cook them prior OR take some of the broth home to cook later. Most of the stuff really don't make good leftovers, so I wouldn't particularly bother unless you went overboard with the ordering.

PAYING YOUR STUFF
Based on the whole sharing technique, I would just split evenly (except for drinks). Since sides get passed around, splitting according to what you ate might be a giant pain in the ass- for both you and the server. Expect to pay around $20 including some drinks.

Overall experience was fun and worth returning. The list of options is large and the quality is A-OK. Doesn't compare to my Taiwanese experience but hey, this is Phoenix after all."}
{"text":"We were finally able to try this place and we were not impressed. We came on a Saturday around 1:30 and were quickly seated. However, we were seated in a side room. We were lucky that a couple of carts were in that area. We got an order of fried noodles and baked bbq buns. The noodles had good flavor and the buns were nicely sweet. After that the carts seemed to disappear. Eventually a cart with rice noodles came around but then our room was completely ignored. Thankfully, our waiter noticed and would get things from the main room for us. Being relatively new to dim sum, we had no idea what they had available and didn't know what to ask for. We were finally shown a menu but most of the items were already sold out. In the end we had ordered 7 things, including a specially ordered shanghai dumpling, and paid $42. Not worth it. I make better dumplings at home and can eat them while wearing my pjs and watching netflix! The only saving grace for this place was our nice server!!"}
{"text":"I had the dim sum.  I thought it wasn't particularly bad, but it wasn't that great either.  The service was fast at least, but it's a little weird because it's located in a closed off portion of a food court.  Maybe they're looking for space to move into later."}
{"text":"Their dimsum dishes are cheaper than other dimsum around town. Most everything is around $3 even for the rolled stuff rice papers aka banh cuon (I'm not Cantonese so I don't know what they're called). One time though, during when I pay, one lady pointed to the tip line and wanted me to tip (credit card). When I tried to leave, she called me back insisting me to tip. Seriously? i went back and took my cash tips from the table and no tips for you rude server. $0.01"}
{"text":"Love the market for all my Asian shopping needs, but I LOVE the dim sum here! For legit Dim sum in the valley, you
Gotta come to Mekong. Knocking a star off because the wait can be ridiculous on weekends, and the system for the wait list is horribly organized. My advice is to get their around 10, and don't hesitate to order off the menu!"}
{"text":"Went with family for dim sum brunch yesterday.  Overall, I give them 3 stars, but they have the potential for more.  First of all, the service is slow and very uneven.  They have a big sign asking for more hired help serving and bussing tables, so that may be the main problem they are dealing with.  But the dim sum offerings are inconsistent in taste -- some pretty darn good, some pretty bland.  The typical har gau, siu mai, and fan gau are good, but other dishes like the steam tripe offerings and the black bean spare ribs (paiquat) are pretty bland.  Also, we were there just before noon so all the dishes should have been prepared and available, but they were not -- we got our har gau at the very end after a long wait, but we never got our harm sui gok.  We saw one cart with roast pork on it, but never saw the char siu, or roasted duck or chicken offerings.  We will try again one more time later in the year."}
{"text":"Wow, this place has really gone down. Went for dim sum this afternoon and it was the worst experience I have ever had at a dim sum restaurant. I was seated promptly and my drink order taken right away. They sat me towards the back end of the restaurant on a side table. Wish they would have sat me in the center instead as that is where the dim sum carts seemed to pass and only there. For some reason they didn't think that any of the customers on my side of the restaurant needed anything to eat. When I tried to flag one lady with a cart down she just ignored me. A few of the other customers on the same side of the restaurant as me were starting to get annoyed as well and one gentlemen even made a stink about it with the manager. I did notice that the tables that got the best service were the tables that had larger Asian groups of people and if they were fluent in the same dialect as the dim sum ladies, even better. BTW, I am Chinese American and I found this offensive. Feel bad for any discrimination towards none Asian customers or even bananas like me. Will never spend my money there again."}
{"text":"This is as good as dim sum can get in AZ.  you'll need to wait for a seat as this place is quite busy.  You can also order classic Chinese dishes off their menu."}
{"text":"Fantastic Dim Sum.  The dumplings are delicious;faves are shrimp and pork.  The spare ribs in black bean sauce also very good.  The duck and fried pork is wonderful.  Everything tastes fresh and you can clearly taste herbs and spices.  Although it is \"wallless\" in the mall it still has a cozy feel and I liked the decor.  Love this place and have bern often."}
{"text":"My fam and I enjoy dim sum and this place was the most authentic place in all of Phoenix! A definite must try when in the area.

The Peking duck was served with buns and plum sauce and on another dish as duck lettuce wraps. Absolutely delicious! Also ordered the steamed shrimp and pork, steamed BBQ pork buns, baked BBQ buns, house special pan fried noodles, egg tarts, as well as a few other dishes.

Excellent service! Happy eating"}
{"text":"Aside from the smell inside here, it's pretty cool. They sell made to order Hone Doe Cake.  (small stand out side the doors of the grocery store. in the common area) They are good"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and its really just because I want dim sum for a hangover. The service is really hectic which is a little expected but sometimes I'm just left hanging. Its usually really packed on the weekends so expect a wait which isn't too bad since you're already in Mekong plaza there's some options. The food is usually consistent, which means you know what you expect which isn't anything to rave about. The variety is there usually but I haven't been there on a weekday. The common fares (shu mai, hargow, and the beloved chicken feet) are usually bountiful which I know is always a problem at other places when you have to wait for them to make more but sometimes its just one cart of them it seems and you either wait patiently or do like the older patrons and just attack the cart directly."}
{"text":"First of all, do not come to this place on weekdays, the service is bare minimum (not saying the weekend is much better, but it will be quicker), not much selection of the dim sum and they are not fresh. Yeah you have to wait to be seated on the weekend but trust me it will worth your money. This is after the last time we went there on Wednesday and a staffer was trying to wheel a whole dead pig with a shopping cart in front of our table...on that note, bring your own sanitizer wipes if you decide to shop in the supermarket."}
{"text":"My family always goes here for dimsum. This is their favorite place around and there are a few foodie family members too! This place is always full of Asians - that's how you know it's the real deal! I pretty much always see other people I know enjoying dimsum with their friends and family.

On the weekends, this place is always packed and there are usually several groups of people waiting. The host will give you a number and call out your number when there is a tavle available. They don't shout the numbers very loudly so you just have to stay close and listen. If you don't want to deal with waiting, I would recommend getting there early. I was there with family on a weekday during the holidays and it was still busy - but without a wait.

The quality of food is consistently good and fresh. There are some dishes or variations of dishes that are made to order and those usually come out pretty quickly too. I will say that it's definitely easier if you go with someone who knows the dishes. Makes the experience less stressful for everyone involved. The ladies pushing the carts do know a little English and will do their best to get you what you want if there is a language barrier. When in doubt, you can just point at the dish you want.

The pricing of the dishes is very reasonable and such a good deal for what you're getting in terms of service and quality. I would definitely recommend going with a large group of people so you can try more dishes without it being expensive.

The dining area is connected to the supermarket and other random stores/restaurants so it's great if you want to walk around to look at stuff either before or after eating.

I've come here at night when it's just a regular restaurant and the food is also very good. It's also not quite as busy at night."}
{"text":"I see a lot of complains abt their dim sum.  I think its cause of their opening hype and a new crew being unable to keep up with the opening day crowd ?

Nonethless, I am giving this place a 4 star for the food, not dim sum cause I have not tried it.  I have eaten inside the restaurant area and outside in the food court area.  Decent selection.  Good food.  Especially of note is their roast and bbq items, like bbq pork and roast pork.  Both are excellent and done right.  Trust me, if you go to Best HK or buy them from Lee Lee, they will give u fatty bbq pork sliced very roughly in huge chunk.  Its not the way that should be served as the taste of a giant chunk of pork is a little overpowering especially if you have the bbq sauce flavor.

My buddy who came to visit from Colorado loves their roast duck so much, he went there on the last 3 days of his visit.  His main complain was why I did not bring him there earlier in the week ?

So U know, come here expecting seafood well prepared ,wok dishes cantonese style, cantonese/hk style bbq and U will have a good meal.  I cannot vouch for their orange chicken or mongolian beef but if U want asian american food, there should be a good offering inside the mekong supermarket at the food court.  Inside the mekong supermarket yes.  This one is at the Mekong complex main food court.  don't go to the wrong place okay !"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant! If you're duck lover, or someone who dare to try something new, this is the place to try it out!!! BBQ duck with sweet plum sauce for dipping! It's just sooo yummy!  And the price is reasonable too! Each time i come to Mekong Plaza for groceries shopping I have to stop here for dinner.  ;)"}
{"text":"Definitely NOT the best dim sum. My old favorites were pretty flavorless and the service was not good (measured on a dim sum style of service). 

The building it is in is way cool, though. Memories of Hong Kong came flooding back! If you need Chinese pottery, groceries, or just want to practice your Chinese, this is the place to go!!!

Given a second chance I'd try one of the many other restaurants in the complex. If you are craving dim sum, tho, I'd try elsewhere."}
{"text":"I am so annoyed and disappointed. I was so hungry too and I'm just feeling like crap after. There is so much oil in the food. This is unreal. Look at the pics I posted.

So there was a wedding happening fine, it's big enough to have us in a separate room but whatever good for the couple, bad for us.

The staff was frazzled, I got yelled at when I asked for menus because we had 11 ppl and 3 menus. WTF!!! I also got yelled at when I asked what a certain dish was and got yelled at saying, \"it's chicken\" well obviously it is but what kind?? We ordered 8 dishes I can't remember what it all looks like. 

What really ticked me off is the \"signature\" dish of the Szechuan beef with a boat load of oil. It actually killed the flavor, it just tasted like beef cooked in a tub of oil.  The beef was terrible. The only decent dish was the sweet and sour chicken that I got yelled at for asking. I didn't even post the other pics we got, it wasn't worth it and I was in a bad mood after my oil spill.

I honestly look at the cleanliness of this place and I don't know if food inspectors have come here, but there is no way they will pass. This is the last time I will be here. I'm over it. I would rather go to Panda Express. This place is out of bounds."}
{"text":"BLECH!  Let me start off by saying that my dad is the king of horrifying cliches.  Strangely enough, they've actually become a vital part of my vocabulary and somewhat useful.

1) If it sounds too good to be true, then it's probably too good to be true

$2.18 per dish for dim-sum?

2) you get what you pay for
I was telling a buddy of mine that the price trumps the food AND the service.  After being away from the place for a month I forget how yucky the food is and the service is deplorable.
 
3) fool me once, shame on you.  fool me twice (4 times?) shame on me and i deserve to be ripped off the 3rd and 4th times.

We were there on Sunday at 11am and my wife remembered that the carts come out from the kitchen and go around counter-clockwise.  Her theory is that by the time they get to the north side tables, all the food will have been picked at and decimated.  
She insists that we be seated as far from the main entrance (north side) as possible.  We get a table right up against the back wall closest to the kitchen.  We're sitting there for about 10 mins and no carts even pass by.  
I'm like thinking, \"ok, dim sum is not really a fast food environment.  You stayed up way too late Saturday night and you stumble in for brunch.  It's supposed to be a slow, no rush, drink tea and have vibrant conversation with those around you.\"
It was then that I started doing the math (not because I'm Asian.  I know what you were thinking).  I counted about 40 tables with 30 of them occupied.  I looked around to see what the MO of this place is.

A) there are only 2 carts being pushed around at any time (are they trying to lower overhead costs by owning only 2 carts?)  Instead of having several carts with the same items going different directions, it appeared that the cart pusher would only go back and fill her cart when it was empty.  So instead of just exchanging her empty cart for a \"pre-loaded\" cart, she actually disappears for about 3-5 minutes (and I presume she's in the kitchen loading her cart?)

B) since we had no food, I had time to count how many employees were on the floor and what their jobs seemed to be.  2 cart pushers, 3 bus boys (their job seemed to be water fillers, table clearers, and check retrievers) Fine, we all know that you can't seat people if there are no clean tables.  Then I counted 3 more (waiters?) with red vests going to tables and doing I don't know what (taking special orders?).  

There was a man and woman that I assumed were the floor managers or owners that would be walking around doing \"managerial\" things like looking busy, answering questions, telling others what to do etc.

All the while I'm thinking \"more cart pushers (the food is kinda important here) and less whatever the other 8 people were assigned to do.

The 1 hostess/cashier was trying to seat people, take numbers, and take peoples money.  I felt somewhat sympathetic towards her because I overheard a customer say \"you gave us number 22\" and just seated another party when you called out \"22\".  She apparently gave two patrons the same number.  She quickly apologized to customer \"22b\" and out of frustration handed him a slip of paper with the number \"32\".

Needless to say, the customer was not at all pleased with the exchange and hotly protested \"uh, I don't think we want to go 10 places to the back of the line!!\"

It was getting really ugly and awkward but one of the other employees came to the rescue by immediately seating \"22b\" and things were restored to semi-chaos.

Oh, did I mention the food?  When the 1st cart came by our table, the pusher stopped by the table next to us and was fumbling with the little metal dishes and trying to cut the cheng-fun.  She seemed a little shaky and not at all concerned with serving the customers swiftly.  While she was trying to serve the other table, her cart was blocking the aisle and the other cart pusher had to stand there and wait until she was done.
When the cart finally came to our table, we were so famished and anxious that we just started grabbing this and that in fear of never seeing the cart again.

We grabbed the following dishes:
1) shrimp cheng-fun:  Rubbery and kinda bland
2) chicken feet:  Great sauce, but the chicken was not tender and again....rubbery (perhaps leave it in the steamer longer?)  Funny thing is, we've ordered the same 2 dishes the past 3 times and it's the same....RUBBERY!   I guess you could say it's our fault for falling for the same rubber chicken trick each time.
3) Har-gow:  standard steamed pork dumplings, tasted pretty good (or was I just starving and grateful for anything that touched my chopsticks?) haha
4) Wu-tao-gock:  Fried taro was decent
5) Foo-jook-gien:  steamed pork with black fungus wrapped in bean curd skins.  was probably the best thing that touched our palates.

I know what your saying, why do you keep eating the dim-sum if the quality is mediocre at best and the service is non-existent?

PRICE!  it's like a mosquito drawn into a bug zapper."}
{"text":"FINALLY!!! I have been looking for a dim sum place in this area for years!! I am a huge fan of the dim sum in San Francisco, and it's been so hard to find a good substitute out here in Arizona. 

The service was lightning fast - we had our drinks and food within two minutes of sitting down. They have a fantastic selection of dishes, my favorite being the steamed pork buns. I have searched high and low for those in the valley and I am so happy to have finally found them. 

This place is also suuuuuper affordable, which is great for someone like me on a college budget. It's located inside a mall type thing, but the ambience is better than I would have expected. I really enjoyed coming here and I can't wait to come back! 

Bring your friends and get ready to munch on some delicious dim sum!"}
{"text":"Located in the Mekong Plaza food court, we found this place by accident.  We went to the Filipino restaurant next door (Wholly Grill).  I was telling my wife that it had been a long time since I had a really good beef stew noodle soup.  She had a craving for yang chow fried rice, but we had ordered at the Grill.  (See separate review.)  We went to the Palace and ordered both items to go for the following day at home.  We live in Prescott Valley and there isn't a decent Chinese restaurant within 50 miles.  It was excellent!  The beef stew noodle soup was flavorful and the meat was quality.  I'm not a big fan of fried rice, but the one we brought home could change my mind.  They have a nice and spacious setting for a food court environment and there's no doubt we'll be back."}
{"text":"Dim sum you win and dim sum you lose.  Mekong Palace is always a winner!  Usually get the roasted duck, sea bass and usually a lobster plate-- always delicious.  Best dim sum in Arizona with great service."}
{"text":"They have new hours! Chinese authentic food at 11PM? Count me in!!! 

I love the duck and pork combo. It was delicious. And the new hours pretty much make it the only restaurant in Phoenix where I can get Chinese food late enough due to work :)."}
{"text":"Good dim sum at really reasonable prices.  I think we had a party of 12 and the total bill was under $150.  Get there early because the place fills up quick, and don't wait for your waiter to come around if you want some of the truly excellent roast duck and charsiu pork.  Get up from the table and go order it from the stall and point to your table.  I pretty much liked everything they had there.  The other stand out that you have to get while you're there is the turnip cake which is the perfect play between slightly crispy on the outside to salty and gooey on the inside, and the chowmein noodles which were cooked to al dente perfection with the right amount of sesame oil to season...perfection."}
{"text":"We have had dim sum and dinner here. Dim sum is a cluster...holy unorganization. I drove 20 mins here to try it and while they have nice variety, I would not do it again. I think dim sum seems expensive. It was 3.28?? Per basic dish? Our bill was 80 bucks for 3 eating adults...4 hardly eating kids. Unless they charge per seat or something, the math was just not right. Dinner was lackluster. We ordered $150 worth and it was nothing I would come back for either. We got the stir fried crab (price was awesome but taste was mediocre), Westlake soup, duck, kung pao shrimp, house fried rice, singapore noodles and maybe one more item. Not a single dish made me think to myself that I would come back for. Service is decent."}
{"text":"The past couple times I've been here, I go prime time Sunday morning (the hell hour for people waiting for a table) and my plates were usually cold or luke warm. It didn't really taste fresh and the dim sum wasn't amazing. Nothing really stood out to my taste buds since they were kinda bland. I would rather try phoenix palace or Great Wall."}
{"text":"There's another place rated #1 but honestly, this should be #1 in the valley for dim sum. The atmosphere is less stressful with the carts, you don't have to sit at a table with a bunch of strangers, and most importantly the food is FAR better tasting! Try everything you want to try - you won't spend that much. I introduced the boyfriend to dim sum here, and I'm really glad it was here instead of the unmentionable higher ranked - he loved it with his first bite!"}
{"text":"I went here for dim sum with my parents who are visiting from northern cali on a Sunday.  I wanted to get their take on it.  Before this place, China King down in Chandler was always my favorite dim sum place.  They had a great variety, the dim sum was not greasy, and the service was decent.

Mekong Palace does what China King does but even better.  There are more varieties of dim sum to choose from.  The restaurant is also a lot bigger and much cleaner with their tile floor.  China King's carpet has gotten really dirty over the past few years.  The usual chicken feet, har gow, siu mai, chow fun, and congee, which are my standards, are excellent here.  Also every time I go, I always seem to find some new item I've never tried before.

Price wise, it's as cheap as it can get.  With 4 people eating all the dim sum they can and hot tea, I think the bill is usually $40-$50 total.

To top it off, you can go grocery shopping next door after you're done or grab a boba tea at the taiwan cafe in the mall.

My parents said the dim sum was pretty close, if not equal, to what they get in the bay.  Definitely my favorite dim sum place in the valley, and I've been to  cfu, china king, phoenix palace, golden buddha, and great wall."}
{"text":"Great place for Chinese food. Price just right, with lots of choices. Quite a crowd. Come early to have a good seat. Order the seafood and you will not be disappointed. 

They also have Hot Pot Cuisine. You have your own pot to cook food. Lots of meat, veg & seafood choices."}
{"text":"Good chicken feet. Everything else meh."}
{"text":"Good price with great selection of seafood and other Asian grocery,   I also like the other eatery around,  I had a desert next door.  I think the prices is better than I have back home in the Bay Area in California"}
{"text":"Came around noon and the wait wasn't so bad. I didn't like that they didn't have enough people pushing the cart. For the amount of people there, there should be more people serving. The food was OK and the place itself is just a bunch of tables placed in middle of a food court. all and all.....its just OK."}
{"text":"We frequent here at least once a month with always at least 7 people. The wait is crazy, but well worth it! The food is amazing, the guy and girl manning the front counter are amazing and on point, the staff is amazing (except for one lady who pushes the cart and looks pissed off all of the time) and everything is super clean. 

I LOVE their salt and pepper shrimp, rice porridge and baked BBQ pork buns.

There seemed to be less food pushed around today, but the guy at the front saw me looking and brought the food to us!! 

Like I said, this place is amazing. So much better than the phoenix palace!"}
{"text":"I really wish I could give them zero stars.  My family spent over $200 for dinner.   They served us a rotten fish and refused to give a refund.  The restaurant was empty on a Friday night.  That should have been a clue of how sucky they were!"}
{"text":"Not a lot of toppings on the dishes. The sticky rice wrapped in lotus leaf was mediocre.  Although it is a Guangdong cuisine, not many of the waitresses spoke camtonese.  One waitress completely ignored someone at a table. Came here for the chinese food. slightly disappointed in its quality."}
{"text":"Held a banquet dinner here and was not impressed. We booked in advance for 3 tables, and although the restaurant is really just a part of the food court, they were able to partition off a semi-private section for us. On the day of the event, they called to inform us that the chicken dish on the banquet menu was unavailable and offered to replace it with a different chicken dish. We agreed because we weren't sure of any better alternatives, but that dish actually ended up being the least popular dish of the whole meal. Overall, all of the dishes were very mediocre and not that memorable. Additionally, the steamed fish was not tender at all and not the appropriate kind of fish to be serving steamed. 

One of the waiters also had an off-putting manner (responding sarcastically when we made requests), and didn't even have knowledge of the menu (he mistook bamboo fungus for fish belly). Additionally, only two of the three tables were large enough to serve banquet-style. The third table (the one I sat at) was could only fit 4-5 dishes at a time, making it necessary for them to constantly be shifting things to smaller plates/packing dishes away. 

Good venue for a large group, but not the best setting/quality of food for an important event."}
{"text":"I enjoy shopping here for all things foreign to my American upbringing. Isles are crowded, over loaded with all sorts of products. Their fish is ALWAYS fresh! I will make the extra drive from LeeLees to here since LeeLees has gone down hill. Most don't speak English at this location which sometimes makes for an exciting discovery of some new food."}
{"text":"This was probably my fifth here for dinner. Came in on a Saturday night with a group of 5. Staff was very polite, attentive, and prompt with our order of food and any requests. The food itself was amazing. We ordered for a family style dinner. The sweet and sour chicken was good; could use more crunch to it. Pea leaves or roots of peas (I forgot what it was called) was good; not over seasoned and was slightly plain but it contrast the big flavors of the other dishes (which is why I like getting a vegetable plate). Fried fish tilapia with a soy sauce like sauce to go with it. This had an amazing airy crunch, the meat was soft and buttery, and the sauce was a perfect compliment for it (had a slightly spicy and not too salty soy sauce taste to it. Clams with black bean sauce was amazing; it was over cooked or too salty (since black bean sauce can be extremely salty if used in excess). The French style filet lignin had an amazing flavor to it. The consistency is so soft and melt in your mouth, but it seemed like the poor a whole cup of oil on it - that... I didn't like. Overall good food and service."}
{"text":"Have been to this place for 3 years and honestly there is nothing remarkable from them. After they got a new manager the place seems worse. We went there 20mins earlier before they open n the manager was like kicking us out by saying rude and disrespectful words. So we changed a restaurant n would never go back again."}
{"text":"This is one hot place!  I don't mean  popular (although it is) and I don't mean physically warm (temp was perfect actually).  Jammed with almost all Asian families there for the Palace's great Dim Sum!!!
Someone wrote in a Yelp review to get there before 11AM due to the crowding.  We arrived at 10:50AM , and chose some little dishes from carts, pushed mostly by non English speaking women.
At about 11:10AM bright lights began flashing, an alarm loudly began pulsating, and a cloud of gray smoke billowed out of the kitchen door.  Staff began running in and out of the kitchen and we were all asked politely \"to get out of Dodge\", and be quick about it.  We were one of the last to get up as I was enjoying my little treats.  Food was great but perhaps a bit rushed, but the good part is they didn't charge us for early lunch!!!  We will return on another weekend if they re-open soon.  Interesting to be eating and watch firemen chopping holes in the kitchen wall as our entertainment, GO Mekong Palace!!!"}
{"text":"I agree with other folks who said service is a joke. Stood at the booth for a while and the receptionist never bothered giving us a number. Then one of the cart ladies tried to charge for an extra dish. Food was mediocre. Most of the food have been on the carts for so long they were warm at best.  Wish there were more dim sum places around to choose from."}
{"text":"We came here for dim sum after rave reviews from some trusted friends.  Well....

eh.

First, their \"duck tongues\".  Supposed to be great.  Frankly, they were like chicken feet.  Nothing to them.  Just bone (yes, there's a bone in the tongue).  Not really the fault of Mekong Palace, of course.  Just the nature of the duck tongue.

But as for the rest, it was very strange.  Pretty much everything we had tasted basically the same.  Shumai, dumplings...everything.  Tasted the same.  Not that it tasted \"bad\".  It didn't.  But what's the point in a variety of things if they all taste basically the same?  It was boring.

Probably won't be coming back here."}
{"text":"Held my wedding reception here a couple months ago and Sharon and her team did an amazing job. She blocked off half the restaurant for my guests and the set up was definitely more than I expected. 
From beginning to end, the reception went perfectly. The service and staff were attentive and everyone raved about the food. Because my reception was in between lunch and dinner, we had a half dim sum/half plated menu and everyone had so much food left over to take home! 
I would absolutely recommend this place over some other Chinese restaurants in the valley if you were looking for a delicious, clean (emphasis on clean), cost effective wedding reception or party location. 
We even had a couple people who had food allergies and Sharon made an alternate menu to cater to them."}
{"text":"I tried this DIM SUM place twice just to make sure and give them a second chance. The first time I said I will never come back but my mom convinced me to try it again. My wife and I did try it the second time and it was not a mistake. This place is terrible. They had flies all over and my wife had a major migraine after eating. I think they use MSG on their food. MSG is nasty stuff that makes food taste good but it is bad for you. Their fried pork chop made me cough like crazy and that night had a bloody stool. Sorry for the details but I want people to be aware before they try this place. I guess if you don't have a medical problem or allergies, then nothing to worry about. 

I thought I just share my experience. 

I prefer Phoenix Palace at Dobson and Warner in Chandler. They never use MSG, food tastes fresher and service is excellent."}
{"text":"My family and I went here on Christmas Day to enjoy some good dim sum but I was wrong. After waiting for 30minutes for a table, we were seated in the back \"next to the stage and towards the exit. 

I have worked in a restaurant before and I understand that the staff was under pressure and frustrated because it was Christmas Day and they have a lot of customers to serve. Their customer service was mediocre. Although it was busy as hell, they should maintain a professional and jolly environment for the customers because it was Christmas after all.

There was about 3 carts circling around but they only circled around the front area and by the time they came around to the middle and the back section, everything was gone.. If they made it to our table at all. Sometimes they come by and sometimes they would skip us entirely even though we tried to get their attention. They were quick about refilling our water, teas, and cleaning up the table the get out of there. We even asked the lady I'd she could bring us out a dish and she responded with, \"LATER, OK!\". Wtf, that was the first time anyone in a restaurant said \"later\" to me. 

I will not come back here again. Not worth the time and money. I rather eat at somewhere else where my service is appreciated."}
{"text":"Typical dim sum served at this restaurant is typical, raging from fair to very good. Most members of the service staff are friendly, a few are efficiency oriented."}
{"text":"I love going to the 'to go' section and ordering half roasted duck, half soy sauce chicken, and dim sum chicken feet.  I eat the chicken feet to benefit my joints, ligaments, and tendons but really I like the taste.  I take all this home and eat it with my cooked brown rice.

I don't like waiting in long lines for dine in on weekend mornings/noon.  

Service for to go is fast and friendly.  The food is delicious."}
{"text":"The reason why I love dim sum is the varieties of different things you can try for $2 certain dishes. My favorite are the shu Mai which is a pork and shrimp dumplings with mushrooms. Unfortunately this place didn't deliver the shu Mai here are scrawny and dry. I recommend Great Wall in Phoenix it's bigger and juicier. I guess this place will suffice if your craving dim sum and don't want to go the distance."}
{"text":"This is a solid dim sum place. I've been to ones in NYC and found that this is actually a little less greasy. The proportions are a little bigger and the flavors aren't as delicate as some other places. Overall though it hits the spot and I'm glad it exists!"}
{"text":"Nice to see this option in Pheonix.  Restaurant is in back.  Typical busy and everyone's in a hurry.  Lots of parking.  Food was good.  We order extra noodle plates and they where very good and hot.  Staff very nice"}
{"text":"If you go early in the morning on the weekends, there is essentially no wait time. Cart pushers are pretty quick to bring you the food. They will start gathering around your table right after you sit down.

Food: 
Compared to the other dim sum places, it's about the same. 
However, their duck is pretty good and they do have a grill alongside the wall how to cook dishes like the turnip cakes. Haven't seen many of those at the other dim sum places.

Price is average compared to other places.
Atmosphere is pretty open and clean. 

Waiters are pretty attentive and respond within reasonable time."}
{"text":"Mekong Palace is located off Dobson Rd. and Main St. in Mesa.  This food court eatery is located inside the Mekong Plaza shopping center.  Mekong Palace is a trifecta of a restaurant.  During the day they offer up Dim Sum, the evenings it's either classic Chinese dining or Hot Pot!

Dim Sum is what I like to call Asian Tapas.  Dim sum, literally translated, means \"touch of the heart.\" Traditional legend says that women would make dim sum dishes for their husbands before they went off to work.  For this reason, dim sum is very labor intensive, made up of small Bo-Bite-sized pieces (usually served in dishes of 2-4 pieces) with attention to detail; even going so far as lines on dumpling wrappings.  Dim sum is traditionally served for breakfast and lunch and is considered an art form amongst Chinese chefs. 

Modern day Dim Sum is served by the waitstaff pushing carts around and in between tables, while patrons view and select the dishes in the carts.  My family and I usually go on Sunday mornings like most Asian families.  I jokingly call this Sunday gathering Chinese Church.  Dim Sum is also called \"Yum Cha\" or drinking tea since tea is the choice of beverage.

Mekong has all your favorite Dim Sum plates from Siu Mai, Cha Siu Bow, Nah My Guy to Guy Lans and Nai Wong Bows.  Yes, I know, it sounds so foreign, but it's the only way to order it.  No worries, the servers translate all these dishes in English well.   Make sure you bring a Chinese speaking friend.  Not only is it almost a requirement, but makes it more fun, as well.  I love the Dim Sum here not just because the food is great, but because of the atmosphere.  Mekong rocks out on classic Andy Lau, Jacky Cheung, and Vivian Chow music playing while you enjoy a great meal with family and friends.

During the evening, Mekong Palace pumps out great Chinese cuisine.  They have everything from your favorite Kung Pao Chicken to your Sweet and Sour Pork.  However, they also have some great classic authentic Chinese dishes such as Stir-fried Lobster, Mapo Tofu, and my favorite, Stir-fried String beans and pork.  

Think that's it?  Well think again!  Mekong Palace also offers up Hot Pot style dining.  Here at Mekong you get your own pot of hot boiling stew and choice of flavor, while cooking your own ingredients made to order; fresh chopped vegetables, round eye beef and diced calamari.  I love eating Hot Pot here since it's very tasty and also very affordable.  At $2-$3 per plate, this place can get you full real quick at a very fair value"}
{"text":"Located in an open area within a small mall. Went to dim sum and it was just average."}
{"text":"The food is okay. It doesn't taste that fresh if you come late. The employees there need a smile and a hug. They are rude. My mom and I sat there and was waiting for my husband to get a to go duck and chicken. An employee walks by and kept staring at our table just to tell us that the bill didn't include a tip and that we should tip then. They didn't even deserve it. Came by our table ONCE didn't ask us if we needed more water or anything else. Appalled. Finding somewhere else to eat dim sum."}
{"text":"Mekong is one of my favourite places for dim sum in the valley. Any time I go for dim sum, or any time my friends want dim sum, we go to Mekong. The quality of their food here is quite good. We usually order shrimp dumplings, shumai dumplings, sticky rice wrapped in bamboo leaf, egg tarts, and a variety of other yummy plates. I really like the fried taro dumplings and the daikon pancakes. Those are sometimes not available if you come too late. 

I usually set dim sum time for 10:30 am. At that time, it's usually still early enough to get a table without much wait, the food is fresh, and the carts are full of options. By 11:00 am, the dining area starts to fill up and the line starts building. The kitchen sometimes gets behind around 11:00-11:30 though, as it seems that the carts stop coming by for a good 20 minutes or so. But, that means that you have time to stop eating, relax, catch up with everyone at the table, and drink some delicious tea. Speaking of which, I've stuck to either the green tea or chrysanthemum, but I recently tried the oolong, and it is fantastic!"}
{"text":"Ordered some dimsum to go plus the salty calamari with jalapenos and can i just say that their serving for almost just 5 bucks of calamari is pretty hefty. The dimsum that i got are shrimp shu mai, taro dumplings, and the crystal shrimp (not sure that this is the name). Anyway the guy that i talked to on the phone was nice. When i picked up the waiter wasn't bad as well. But when I got home i was missing one order of taro dumplings. :( i just let it go since 2.36 isn't worth arguing for. But all in all yes for dimsum, just double check stuffs to make sure u get what u paid for."}
{"text":"Tried the dim sum inside Mekong for the 1st time on a Sunday around 10:45 am. Waited about 30 minutes for a party of 10. We were sat at the very back of the place next to a really filthy fish tank. The table looked dirty but I think it's really more from too much wear. The restaurant didn't have defined walkways, so there was a lot of weaving through tables and searching for room to walk through. 

Let's talk about the service... we asked for forks for the younger guests that were with us and the server seemed to be bothered with the fact that he had to go out of their way to get us forks. At the end of the meal, we were given the bill, we waited for 10 minutes holding up the check trying to flag someone to take our payment. The rest of our party had already dispersed at this time. Finally, one server came to us and we tried to hand them the bill back and she just waved her hand no and walked away. Okay........ Luckily one of the people in our party came back and told us that they're taking payment up front. Couldn't the server have told us that?!?!

As for the food, we ordered noodles, veggies, turnip cakes, sesame balls, egg cream buns, pork shumai, fried shrimp wonton, hargow and so many others. Everything was good. No complaints in the food area.... except when we told the lady we wanted shrimp shumai she have us pork shumai and figured we didn't know the difference????"}
{"text":"Grocery store has tons of choices to choose from. Many different types of restaurants all in one place. It's our favorite place to shop and eat."}
{"text":"Overall pretty good dim sum..we came at 11am on a Saturday and were seated immediately.  Although I noticed a wait forming as we got to the end of our meal.  They had all of the usual favorites and the tea was plentiful and piping hot."}
{"text":"Dim sum 
The grocery store
Boba drinks 
Korean skincare 

These are a few of my favorite things"}
{"text":"Went here for Dim Sum with the Breakfast  Club. Turns out we had just the right amount of folks for the largest of the tables.  I am still not that up on what is in everything but with two in our group that spoke Chinese we had no surprises.  There were some textures I didn't care for but nothing I disliked the taste of and I went away full without much of a dent in the wallet.  

I really need to go back and explore the plaza more.  It looks sort of like they just wall off part of the food court to serve Dim Sum."}
{"text":"This is my \"Go-To\" place when my Pacific Rim upbringing bubbles to the surface!

As I have mentioned elsewhere, I lived for lunch in Chinatown San Francisco for nearly a decade (about 2 decades ago).  That said, I learned the difference between proper Chinese food and suburban American mall Chinese food.  The Mekong Palace IS NOT Panda Express, so don't expect it.

I have been to the Palace each time I need to do some grocery shopping for things \"Pacific Rim\".  And each time I would estimate the dining room as 85% / 15% in terms of patrons; a good measure for finding real Chinese dining.

The menu is extensive and nearly all the fish can be chosen in the wall of tanks alongside the wall - seriously I'm talking about a least over a dozen fish and crab/lobster tanks!

Dim Sum has been added to the lunch menu and for those of you unfamiliar with this treat I cannot recommend trying it!  If you are unfamiliar with the term, I would suggest Google or Wiktionary for a generalized idea of this treat.

I nearly always have one of my two favorites; Beef Chow Fun or BBQ Duck and Wonton Noodle soup.  Here's a hint, don't try to eat an order of each, they're just too big!

The soup is a meal unto itself.  Then again, there are a couple of dozen types of soup on the menu and, depending on your taste, each one can be delicious.  As for me, I just smile with the pile that comes as \"soup\". when I order it.

Before I leave you, let me say there are some excellent reviews of the Mekong Plaza and the various shops within.  If it's an Asian type of food, there is a lovely restaurant within the center serving it.  I'm just partial to the dishes I described.

Lastly, the supermarket in the center is excellent!  But then again, you may have the feeling you've left Arizona and been plopped in the middle of somewhere on the Pacific Rim!

Enjoy the adventure!"}
{"text":"Came to Mekong Palace for February's Breakfast Club UYE to try some Dim Sum, we were a party of 10 and were seated right away.  

Even though the restaurant itself sits in the back of a shopping center, once you are seated you sort of forget that you are in a shopping plaza.

We tried at least 15 different items, everything was delish, my son really enjoyed the shark fin rolls the roasted duck, we also tried noddle dishes, a chicken and rice dish, steamed bbq pork buns, oh gosh we tried everything,  every dish offered a new flavor and everything was very yummy!

Like I said we were a party of 10, and tried over 15 different styled dishes and the total bill for each of us with tip included: $13 bucks! That's right! Great meal for an excellent price, but have to be honest, none of were thinking with our wallet when picking items, we just wanted to tried all the things we could and I was quite shocked to learn it was just 13 per person. 

It was a great time had by all, and I look forward to coming back!"}
{"text":"We were with at a banquet party of 90ppl.  It was strange set up, the restaurant is actually part of the food court and tucked away in the side with portions.  So you can still see and hear the food court.  But hey if they have good food, I do not care.

For serving a banquet of 90ppl, it takes good coordination and they did a pretty good job.  Here are the goods and the bads:

Goods:
Food was coming out the kitchen in a good rate
They came around to change out our plates
The combination plate appetizer was good:  roasted duck, soy sauce chicken, bbq pork, beef, and jelly bands
French beef cubes was tasty
Steamed fish


Bads:
They did not serve us water after the meal was done
The rice did not come until 7 of the 9 dishes were out 
Soup was bland
Boiled chicken was just cold
Seafood chow mein did not have enough flavor"}
{"text":"The 2 star is purely based on the taste of the food because the service was a joke. I had the honey walnut shrimp and the batter was super old..it taste stale. Also had the pork chop and man..that was really unappetizing. So the food..definitely do not recommend. 

Let's talk about the service. We came there and they sat us down..with no menus..and disappeared for 20 minutes. No one to tag down..like wtheck? So finally we saw a waiter so we told him we needed the menu. The waiter himself was very apologetic..even the table next to us told him we were waiting for a long time. So he told us drinks are free. Ok that's fine. Took forever for the food to come out. Service was mediocre. Asked for the check and nope, drinks were charged but I'm not about to fight 3 dollars off the bill. I just won't come here again. Food sucks anyways."}
{"text":"My first visit and quite impressed with roast duck, shrimp and pork dumplings, sticky rice. Cart service is average so need to find a waiter and ask ford your favorite. Quality of roast duck comparable to those found in good restaurants of Monterey Park , California and Richmond, BC. Will try other in menu in future."}
{"text":"Came here for a family dinner ( total of 13) and had ordered a set dinner for 8 ppl ! We had ALOT of food and overall the food was decent ... Coming fr la it wasn't as bad as I thought it would be . Some dishes were a little bit on the salty side but overall impress w the food ."}
{"text":"We came here with one of our meet up groups specifically for dim sum. We had never been to this dim sum before and to be honest it wasn't as good as other places we have been. The food was OK but a few of our meat dishes were pretty dry. In addition the carts did not come around as frequently as other places and it seemed like we waited forever for one specific cart that had a dish that we really wanted to have. We did enjoy the building it was in however. We had no idea this place existed and it was fun walking around and seeing all of the other Asian shops that share this location. There is a huge Asian market and it seemed to carry everything one could want to cook a splendid Asian meal."}
{"text":"Awesome Pho, I had the chicken. There were some odd crispy chicken pieces, but I believe it was fried fat perhaps. Not terrible, just unexpected. The rest of the chicken was shredded. The spring rolls were so fresh with crispy veggies and tasty shrimp. Service was fast and friendly. The location is perfect as well, you can do some shopping afterwards in the shops nearby."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service . Food is okay. We wanted dim sum and the same cart kept coming back  wasn't what we wanted . Asked our waiter he said to wait for it . We waited 25 mins , still didn't come so we left. Told the hostess and she said it's our fault for not telling the main lady . Like, there's a bunch of ladies , our waiter could've came them for us . Also the tea wasn't even hot."}
{"text":"pretty much a toss-up as to best dim sum in the valley between this place and phoenix palace in chandler.  prices are pretty comparable btwn these 2 places.  having eaten a bunch of times in hong kong and vancouver and knowing a thing or two about dim sum, i still love coming here.

plusses (compared to phoenix palace):
- cooler dim sum hall atmosphere in the cavernous hall in the back of mekong plaza
- tends to use thinner skin for dumplings than p.p.
- 10min closer if you're coming down from up north

minuses (compared to phoenix palace):
- little less variety of items, although mekong does offer few things that p.p. does not offer, like bbq pork pies.
- tends to be more droughts here in terms of carts coming around.  
- while they do certain items better than p.p., i feel there are a little more hits & misses here."}
{"text":"Came for dinner with my family, and the food here was not good. The hot and sour soup was barely spicy or sour, and had a strange gamey taste. Thank god they had chili oil and vinegar on the table. The tea tasted like plastic. The crab puffs were decent. My husband got the beef fried rice and found a smushed gnat in his food. Additionally, the rice didn't seem to be actually fried. It was more like steamed rice with stuff in it. The chicken with honey ginger was ok. I liked the pickled ginger. Overall, would not return here."}
{"text":"Mostly I come here for the Hot Pot. If you have not tried Hot Pot, you're in for a treat (Google: \"sichuan hot pot\" to get up to speed). Head to the food court. Hang a right. Stop at the host/hostess podium and tell them you are there for Hot Pot.

In so far, I have found Hot Pot at Mekong is the best Hot Pot venue in the Valley. It's not much on ambiance, but the taste is out of this world. Come with friends and have a nice relaxing social meal. 

If you're new to Hot Pot and you didn't Google it yet, just know that Hot Pot is like Chinese fondue but with a tasty broth/soup. The food is brought to you raw and you cook it yourself. 

\"Awesome\" you say? Indeed! It's very awesome. 

You also get a bowl for additional ingredients/spices (e.g. Green Onion, Jalapenos, Cilantro, Sesame Oil, Sesame seeds, Satay Sauce, garlic, etc.) for dipping or to tailor your broth.

I typically get the following: Rib Eye, Chicken Breast, Headless Shrimp, Bok Choy, Napa Cabbage Udon noodles, and Shiitake. Sometimes my son and I get lobster. Be aware, it you get the lobster, it's divided on a plate... and still moving.

Hot Pot is a social culinary experience. So, just settle in for 45-75 minutes of spectacularly tasty Just-In-Time cooking, by your own hand, and neighborly discussion.

At the end of the meal they bring a cube of bone-pale gelatinous goo. I assume it's some form of bean curd. I don't care for it. My son loves it. I always forget to tell them not to bring me one. What can I say, the after glow of the meal just leaves me mindlessly, stupidly happy.

There are many other restaurants in Mekong. Shame on me that I gravitate exclusively to the Hot Pot (because it's just that DAMN GOOD) and have not tried any of the other fare.

The Market is nice and handy too. Check it out. It's only slightly less awesome than Lee Lee's, so it's def worth a visit if you are in the area."}

{"text":"Two stars for the food, NEGATIVE stars for everything else. Came here at noon with my mom and husband on a Saturday for dim sum and the place was a disaster of epic proportions. We've been coming here since they opened and it's always been busy, but this was a new low. Here are the highlights:

- A crowd of people swarming the ONE cash register at the entrance with one employee taking payments AND walking incoming parties to their tables. 

- SEVERELY understaffed. Sat for a good 30 min straight without any dim sum carts even coming close to our table. A server took our drink order and we did not see her again for an HOUR when she refilled our waters.

- Servers all looked stressed out and it showed in their bad attitudes to customers. When my mom went up to one such server and asked for an order because we were all so hungry waiting forever for food, the server gave her THE dirtiest look. Multiple people were coming up to them with orders since the carts were clearly not going around to all the tables. There were only four tiny carts total serving close to 200 people. 

- Bonus: a full fledged FIGHT between two male servers broke out at the order pickup counter in plain sight of all the customers in the dining area. Was it highly unprofessional? Yes. Am I sympathetic to their plight? Yes. They're certainly not getting paid enough to endure this misery.

 - No variety of dim sum and many dishes were cold by the time the cart arrived at our table. Did not see a single potsticker or egg tart and it took over an hour to even lay eyes on some shumai. 

Note to management: if you don't have the resources or manpower to serve all the extra tables you've added to your restaurant, maybe hire more employees or seat less customers. Ever heard of quality over quantity? This place has gone SO far downhill since it first opened. 

Bottom line: spare yourself the headache of coming here. You will leave with a bad taste in your mouth that's not just from the MSG in the food!"}
{"text":"It's a pretty fun place. We had about 12 people and they bring back lots of parts with food you tell them that you want take one and put it on the gigantic Lazy Susan in the middle of the table and share with your friends."}
{"text":"Growing up in California, my family has spoiled me with only the best of Chinese food. I am a little reluctant to search for a good Chinese food restaurant here in Arizona, but I couldn't resist the 30% grand opening deal on dishes I haven't had in a while and crave.

Since it was opening week, the place was packed full and service was in disarray.  The decor was interesting....it was an attempt to turn an open food court into a fancy Chinese restaurant - chandeliers and all. Tacky, but honestly, I think it's amusing and gives it character. However, the location is very loud because it is after all an open food court. The table arrangements are also a little bit too crowded and I found myself almost back to back with the table next to me.

Food was decent and good price with the 30% off. I had the cold salt and garlic chicken, squid with black bean sauce, and the seafood tofu hot pot.  The hot pot was a little bland. It was nice to see them use fresh chicken, rather than packaged. Overall, it tasted decent. Nothing stood out, and nothing was terrible. It was nice to have a little taste of what I miss back in California, but I probably won't be returning here."}
{"text":"Last week I found a DEAD FLY in my noodle. The waiter took away my plate and crossed the noodle off the card. They handed me the full-priced check at the end (not including the noodle supposedly.) I asked for a discount because I almost ate the fly! They then gave me a pathetic 10% discount, while the normal standard should be waiving the entire bill. What can I say..."}
{"text":"Only been here 3 times for Dim Sum and the food is average.  Why the low score - service. if you sit in the main area, you've get OK service, but if you get stuck in the side room (like Charles D said), forget about service.  At lease 5 tables around me we getting their own utensils, napkins and plates.  It took 10 min to wave down a waitress to take our order (fill out the Dim Sum sheet) and 10 min to bring us the food.  Another 7 min to bring up utensils, napkins and plates - I refused to get up setup.  One of our dish came out as we were leaving the table - about 45 min later.  The waiter/waitress never apology for being tardy for anything. 

I have gone to many Chinese restaurants in many cities, but this is the worst service I ever received.  I've been here 3 times and yesterday was my last time."}
{"text":"We frequently visit the Mekong Plaza for the fantastic myriad restaurants in the center. One of our favorites is Dim Sum in the Mekong Palace open air restaurant at the northwest end of the plaza.

The staff is usually pretty attentive, but we often feel like we get second class service as \" the white folk in the room\". We normally wait for beverage refills and the check.

If you can look past that as merely a cultural thing, you will like the offerings at Mekong Palace. The Dim Sum is plentiful and great quality. It's always hot, and the steam carts are on it like white on rice and a paper plate in a snowstorm! They are everywhere with the goods.

In addition to Dim Sum, we enjoy the sticky rice and other menu items. At least once a week, we get some BBQ pork or roasted pork from the window to take home. The only iffy item we ever got was a whole roasted duck for Thanksgiving. The kids were scared of it, then everyone got sick after eating it. Just a fluke I guess, since we've never had issues before.

As long as you are ok with the open air restaurant and sometimes the noise that comes with it, you will not be disappointed by the great offerings at Mekong."}
{"text":"i think the restaurant is pretty and the chandeliers are pretty too! i think other reviews are definitely a bit harsh, considering they just opened and they probably need to get their act together a little more. but over all it is the nicest Chinese restaurant in Arizona period. every other place is dirty and tacky. at least i feel clean in the place. the food was decent in the beginning but they're getting better and better. I'm pretty sure in a few months time the food is gonna be as bomb as the Chinese food in California. i am also giving 5 stars to make up for the unfair ratings of previous people. you honestly can't find better Chinese food in Arizona. so kudos to Mekong palace! also the pricing is very good!"}
{"text":"a good family style chinese restaurant. the food was tasty, but may be a bit much on msg cuz i kept wanting to eat even though i was full. i don't like that it looks like a big restaurant in the middle of a food court."}
{"text":"Excellent Dim Sum (Chinese dumplings), in Phoenix of all places.  Tried a few new pieces this time including the shrimp (paste) on green pepper, which was delicious.  Of course the pork buns, an old standby, fresh out of the oven are to die for.  And the crispy shrimp balls, woo hoo!  Me, I ALWAYS get a side of the BBQ duck -- and it is NEVER less than fantastic.   The fried shrimp, with garlic and jalapeno, wowee!  The carts just keep on coming, and the ice tea refills are prompt.  In other words, great service AS WELL AS fabulous dim sum. 

If you're a Dim Sum aficionado, Mekong Palace is great news, you do NOT have to travel to San Francisco.  If you've never eaten Dim Sum before, only heard about it, go to Mekong Palace and be adventurous.   You'll be glad you did!"}

I wound up eating lunch at the main restaurant. Dim Sum. Very, very tasty. Not as good as Great Wall in Phoenix, but it's very good. We also walked off lunch by perusing the Asian grocery store. We bought a few things (saved us a trip to Lee Lees) and left, knowing we'll come back soon.

And yes, I did get my boba tea. It was awesome!"}
{"text":"They served dim sum on Thanksgiving day! $21 for a meal to fill up three people?! It is unbeatable and unbelievable! I was in Denver for dim sum a week earlier and it cost around $38 for two people! I don't know if the dim sum here's freshly made or thawed from frozen but nevertheless I enjoyed my meal here. I had the taro cakes, the fried taro ball, siu mai, ha gow, shrimp balls with sugar cane, mushroom sticky rice inside the leaf, and a couple other dishes. They steam their food in metal containers rather than the wood ones. The only thing that sucked was how long it took for some of the carts to come around. For Thanksgiving they sell a turkey for $58. I don't know how it tastes but it sounded like a cool deal."}
{"text":"Great location for dimsum but the food wasn't as great as we expected.

Michael our server was super nice and helpful."}
{"text":"Finally, a decent dim sum area in the Valley.   The dim sum isn't some chicken shao mei, or small shrimp dink of a har gow.  It's actually tastes like dim sum.   The price isn't bad, and the seating is decent.  It's a bit strange it's in the middle of a food court and they placed a bunch of cheap walls around, but to each their own.  It's a bit more expensive than what I'm used to in Los Angeles, but it's nothing wallet breaking.  It's worth the 40 minute drive to dine here."}
{"text":"Great service and dishes. I would highly recommend others to order the e-mein soup that has wontoins, chicken, shrimp, fish, and squid. It was so bomb! (delicious).  The only thing I would say they can improve on is the selection of dim sum dishes. There are a lot of dim sum options available on the menu...just not ever available."}
{"text":"This place has some good Dim Sum. I wouldn't classify the best but for the area I would say this will have to be my go to spot. I would have liked for some other dishes like Spicy Fried Chicken wings, Garlic String Beans, which they don't have and none of the dishes have sauces (Mayo sauce used for Honey Walnut Prawns on the Shrimp Balls and/or Black Bean Sauce for the Eggplant with Shrimp or Bell Pepper with Shrimp) and none of the items are cut in half. They don't even ask. Hopefully they rotate items and/or have more special order items.

 This place has plenty of seating which makes it difficult for the food carts to make it before food is gone. Make sure you are on the watch for the food to wave them over. I would say go early or prepare to wait. Great location if you are looking to go shopping afterwards."}
{"text":"I will never eat here because they have shark fin soup on the menu.  Our oceans are in jeopardy due the rampant slaughter of sharks for their fins."}
{"text":"They literally get my order wrong , every single time .. . To the point where I'm not even surprised anymore . 
I used to work there and honestly , I didn't even get these many orders wrong every time. 

I always ask if they can double check if everything is right because my order is always wrong . And they reassure me that everything is correct . Knowing the history I have, I should've double checked . But I guess the joke is on me . They just threw random stuff in my order and doubles of stuff I already ordered. And some stuff not even included at all. I've called to complain , but at the end of the day, I feel like just a ticket number . Sad to be so disappointed every time I go. 
I understand a busy rush can sometimes be okay to make mistakes here and there. But every time ?

I only wished I did a better job finding my shumai -- missed it;0(  What I did have was great, the stuffed eggplant, cream buns, sweet rice cakes, soy noodles, duck, taro bun, and I'm sure I'm forgetting something.  I paid $22.00 for my son and I -- a reasonable price for good food.  Only advice is to go early on a Sunday, they open at 10am.  My friend got there around 12 and had to wait awhile.  They will honor your request to seat a big party so my friend and her fiance' graciously saved us seats - 6 of us.  Bring your appetite - fair warning you may have to wait so bring a holdover snack!  It is so totally worth the wait -- we will be eating there again and soon.  Loved it.  Family friendly place.  One more thing -- the menu is at the reception desk, take out is at the back of place at the long counter."}
{"text":"Food was great and at a fair price.  That is if they actually bring it to you.

Never heard of a dim sum place where the cart pushers don't sop.  Our waiter tells us \"sometimes the ladies are like that\".  Really ?  It's a restaurant and the servers have the option ?

After about 45 minutes at noon on a Friday and you only see 4 carts go by and they have the OPTION to not stop after making eye contact and waving ?  Really ?  

No tip.  Not going back !"}
{"text":"Arguably one of the best dim sum places in Arizona.  Lots of variety but much like a lot of dim sum places, service can at times be very hit or miss.  Not all the staff speak English fluently and sometimes in the rush, they may misinterpret what you want.  For example, I asked for steamed shrimp and leek dumplings (rice wrapper, no egg) multiple times and they ended up bringing out the fried version (which also has a wheat wrapper and eggs...although tasty, my wife and daughter has allergies to wheat and eggs).  Luckily, a man named Jun understood what I requested and rectified the situation in a timely fashion.  Overall good place."}
{"text":"We drop in here when we are getting our soy sauce fix. Its a great day when you shop at the market and then stop in for some dim-sum. I really think the Palace is better, over by Lee Lee's. Just my opinion and I am no expert but it is my Taiwanese friend that guides me to these experiences. Lots of strange things, I suggest you take someone who knows the cuisine to help you avoid the ucky ones. (Tentacles and feet)."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Chinese food in Arizona!!!

Ok. I'll admit I was a bit concerned when my mom's friend took us to lunch at a restaurant that's basically in the middle of a mall, but now I know why they need so much room - the food is delicious!

As soon as we sat down we were offered all of these different dim sums. We started with a shrimp roll that was so light and fresh and pork dumplings. 

My least favorite thing that we had was the egg rolls - they were too cakey for my taste and it tasted like pork even though I ordered veggie. 

The fried rice was flavorful without being salty. The Won Ton soup has a wonderful broth with both pork and shrimp won tons. But the real star of the lunch was the lobster in black bean sauce!!! I've never seen such a HUGE lobster ever!!! 

My only real complaint is that the menu has pictures yet the food doesn't match the picture. Like the won ton soup - the picture showed it with noodles yet we were served noodle-less soup :-(

With so many different dim sums to try I can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"If you are not Asian, don't come here. Ignored, not offered beverage service. Only server to come to our table was the dim sum lad. She was nice but the food was aweful!"}
{"text":"The reason for 2 stars is that the service from our waiter was terrible. When we arrived we were seated by someone who was not a hostess or waiter possibly a busboy which was no problem. He gave us the menus water, and tea.   We were ready to order in about 5 minutes waiting for someone to come to our table. It was not busy at all. We went on Thursday nite around 7:00 pm. I saw many young men standing around and talking among themselves not paying any attention to our table. Another 5 minutes went by and I got the attention of the person who sat us and told him we were ready to order. He did not say anything to anyone so I thought he was going to take our order. Another 5 minutes went by then I saw a young man who was standing around talking to others when we arrived finally came over. I told him we had been waiting for a long time. He gave me the excuse that he was busy . After he took our order this was the last time I saw him. The busboy and another young lady brought out our food and the busboy refilled our water glasses. We had to get up ourselves and get doggie bag boxes. There needs to be a manager up front to run this place. The food is excellent but the service very poor. The wait staff doesn't care about service.  I hope they find a manager and better employees because the food is good but reluctant to bring guest there due to terrible service f the house B.B."}
{"text":"This is where I have my dim sum fix once a week. When it gets busy you may be left starving for a bit. So come here as soon as they open. Pretty decent variety dim sum on the carts once it gets to you."}
{"text":"When we arrived there, we were seated within 10 minutes, in the side room, big mistake. The attendant didn't even acknowledged us. We had to flag down the manager who brought us water, tea, napkins, chopsticks and the two sauces.
The servers with the carts finally made it to our section, but most of the items we like were all gone. We finally had a cart that had what we wanted and after had to wait again.
My wife saw one of the carts headed our way but got diverted to another section of the restaurant.
Towards the end, we finally had some decent carts headed our way. My wife saw something she liked towards the end but we were already finished eating.
The food was delicious but cold or at room temperature.
Next time they try to seat us in the side room, we are going to wait. There are 8 tables for 4, and 4 tables for 2 in the side section which was half occupied. No wonder there were lots of people waiting for a table when we left.
Our room attendant never visited our table once. He just focused on the task at hand and never looked around the room. So sad and that's part of what I baste my rating on."}
{"text":"Prologue:
My fiancée and I had previously dined here for Dim Sum on Sunday mornings and our experience was favorable. This time, however, we decided to try something different from their regular menu for our weekly Saturday evening dinner date.


The Plot:
The appetizers were all somewhat familiar, so we elected to skip that and begin with a few of their specialty entrees, including the Seafood Tofu Claypot, Salted Fish with Chinese Broccoli, and Intestine with Sour Cabbage and Chili.


The Scene:
The portion size for all of the entrees was plenty for the two of us. All three dishes were also properly prepared, including the quality, texture, and consistency of the ingredients as well as the seasoning and the presentation.

The Salted Fish with Chinese Broccoli was a variation on the traditional dish (usually with oyster sauce) that was new to both of us and which we enjoyed as much if not more. The salted fish flavor was bold but not overpowering, it nicely complimented the other dishes we ordered, and is something we would recommend trying to all Chinese broccoli fans.

The Seafood Tofu Claypot was quite traditional with good balance of flavor that went very well with the steamed rice. For me the tofu was perfectly cooked and was the centerpiece of this dish, as it should be, along with the usual assortment of seafood.

The star of this meal was most certainly the Intestine with Sour Cabbage and Chili, in part due to the fact that neither of us had previously tried anything quite like it. I'm a big fan of all types of cuisine featuring intestine and this dish was a real treat. The chili definitely delivered some heat, the sour cabbage added a surprising twist, it all worked well, and we thoroughly enjoyed it.


The Rest of the Story:
Service was slow; however it was a busy Saturday night, we arrived rather late in the evening, and the dishes we ordered were somewhat uncommon.
The Salted Fish with Chinese Broccoli was a little misleading in that the broccoli was seasoned with salted fish rather than being served along with salted fish.
My fiancée said she found herself searching for shrimp in the Seafood Tofu Claypot and thought the seafood should have been more plentiful.


Epilogue:
Overall the food was very good, easily deserved 3 stars, and was an experience that I believe any fan of Chinese food would have enjoyed.
We elected to not award a fourth star because my fiancée thought the seafood in the claypot should have been more plentiful and that the dishes overall were a little pricey, especially the Chinese broccoli

{"text":"I am still giving this place a 5-star as we've been here a few times in the past few months for both dinner and Dim Sum.  There are not a ton of places that really cater to real Chinese food here in the East Valley, but this is one of them.  Sometimes the older Chinese guy is a bit not great with his service, but everyone else in terms of service is great.

We came here with our party of 15 the night before Chinese New Year's and it was fantastic.  The service staff which consisted of some young Chinese guys, a Latino man (we've seen him here every time we've come for quite some time), a Latino woman, a Black woman, and some older Asian women along with the older Chinese guy.  Tonight the older Chinese guy was alright, but everyone else was top notch and very accommodating and quickly getting us what we needed.

We got seated in an auxiliary room because the main dining room was taken up by a HUGE party of probably a couple hundred people.  I've never seen this room in all my years dining here, but it wasn't too bad and wasn't as noisy as the main dining room, which was a plus.

The food came out reasonably quickly and much quicker than I thought with having the restaurant so literally packed.  We had a reservation and the usually super large tables they have for us weren't available, so we got 2 smaller tables of 8 each in the auxiliary room.

We had our normal stuff - Beef Chow Fun, a thin noodle dish with pork slices (don't know the English name for this), Bok Choy & Mushrooms, Beef Clay Pot, Honey Walnut Shrimp, the House Soup, Crispy Chicken, Steamed Fish, Peking Pork Chops, Pork with the Crispy Skin, and I don't remember what else.  Our other table that we weren't seated at ordered everything we had PLUS Crab, Lobster and maybe 1-2 other seafood dishes.

Really, service was overall great and the food tasty as usual.

One thing is when you pay the bill, which we had 2 separate checks, they do not add the tip like other restaurants with large parties, so you need to add the tip when you pay yourself.  Not a big deal."}
{"text":"I'm not going to comment on their food, just the fact that they lost our order after 30 mins wait, it's just unbearable."}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday thinking they would have high turnover and a lot of options. Wrong. It was clean and friendly enough, but the options were incredibly limited. Granted being from Seattle and being spoiled by great dim sum doesn't make it better, but I definitely won't be back to this one. Very disappointed in the variety."}
{"text":"We waited for a long time for this restaurant. We even got our groceries done before they called our number, and we were just a party of three. This is a separated place in the building, not an actual restaurant building connected to the strip. We sat in the back so the carts don't come around enough. It was only noon but it seemed like the dessert carts made it to us five times the amount of times the actual entrees made it to us. There were not a lot of options for the main dishes. The ladies were real snobby and unhappy when we decline their carts. They took forever to get us the check. The only reason why this place got 2 stars instead of one is because of this Hispanic guy busting his butt off. He got us utensils when we needed them. He got rid of dirty dishes for us. He got us boxes and when we did not see the check...guess who got our back? The same one guy. If he was not there then we never would have even tipped. We definitely will not be coming back to this place. We were much happier with our experience at Phoenix Palace."}
{"text":"I WAS a Dim Sum Virgin ... Until Monica O. posted February's Breakfast Club UYE at Mekong Palace. 

I clicked \"I'm in!\" and off I went on a Saturday to finally validate that Dim Sum V-Card.  

So this place is in a mall food court; however, once our group of 10 got situated, I barely noticed. 

Glad we had Norm with us for guidance, because I sure as Heck wouldn't have a clue what to do! 

My favorites were the BBQ Pork Steamed Buns, the squid and one of the noodle dishes. 

We tried what seemed like an endless parade of different plates. I know I definitely left quite full. So you can imagine my surprise when we each paid $13 after tip! 

Really enjoyed the company and of course, the food. Look forward to coming back in the future ... And trying Hot Pot!"}
{"text":"I have now been here twice. The first time I came was for dim sum. It was really a cool experience. The dim sum was really good and different from anything I had prior. 

This time we came outside of dim sum hours and just ate some regular plates. We shared a Wonton Noodle Soup and Black Pepper Shrimp and Scallops entree. It was only about 26 bucks (sans tip) and it was pretty dang good if I do say so myself. The entree came with a big old bowl of white rice even though it didn't say that on the menu from what I remembered. The Wonton soup was legit and so was the entree. It was clean. I wasn't even that hungry when we came here but I had to eat it all anyway - out of respect.

If it's good enough you'll push through that wall of fullness. I am coming back for dim sum next time. I don't care how busy it is :)"}
{"text":"I love this place. My family and I eat there on Sunday and have a great time. The food was excellent and you didn't have to wait for the carts to come round. (Which I hate) The service was good too. The four of us eat a lot of good food for around $77. Afterwards we walked the mall. Can't wait to go again."}
{"text":"I went here twice with my friends, both turned out to be disaster. Their siu-mai tasted so weird. It like they cooked with ruber band or something. Also, their chicken feet tasted not so good compared to Phoenix Place in Chandler. 
I would not come back to this place again. If you would like to try every best dim-sum, I would recommend Great Wall at 35th and Camelback in phoenix."}
{"text":"Went here for hot pot.  They offer 5 or 6 types of broth ($2) including satay, Szechwan, and Mongolian.  There are a lot of different meats and vegetables to choose from that you choose a la carte and mark down on a sheet.  Our party of 4 shared some rib eye ($4 each order), lamb shoulder ($5 or $6), winter melon ($2), fried soft tofu, baby bok choy, lotus root, pork, pork blood cubes, and beef ball.  Generally meats will be about $4-6 and vegetables/tofu will be around $2-4.  Our total including one soda ($1.50 for 1 can) ended up ~$15 per person including tax and tip.  The meats and vegetables were delicious and fresh, and there is a sauce/condiment station where you can mix your own bowl of sauce (Sauces and condiments include soy sauce, sesame seeds, chili sauce, sesame sauce, satay, green onion, dried garlic, and cilantro).  Each person at the table gets one pot on an induction cooktop, and dessert is included in your hot pot.  We had a refreshing almond/coconut jello, the perfect complement to our meal.  We'll definitely be heading here again for more hot pot since it's a pretty good deal for what you get."}
{"text":"We were very excited to try this place because it's one of the few places we've found that offer Cantonese style dishes but we were really disappointed. We ordered take out so I attribute the lack of crispness to the travel, but the calamari wasn't cooked through. There was a thick layer of batter and only the outside was cooked. The crab puffs tasted stale and like they were cooked in old oil. The salt and pepper pork chop was good but too expensive. Overall we didn't enjoy our meals and it definitely was not worth the price."}
{"text":"I've been to Mekong Palace many times and my opinion every time has pretty much been, \"It's aight.\" The setup is kind of weird at first because it was converted from a courtyard area to a restaurant but it doesn't seem to affect anything (besides possibly noise).

The dim sum at Mekong is okay. It's not horrible but it's not super awesome, either. I really like the dan tat (egg custard tart things) but it seems like they are out like 90% of the time that I visit. Since I live out of town, this is always disappointing to me. Also, the taro puffs, which are normally my favorite dim sum item, are not very good at Mekong. Their coconut agar jelly sweet is really yummy, though.

Non-dim sum food is also okay. I like their roast pork (the siu yook) but everything else is kind of average. I really like their peking duck but their lettuce wraps (an item that many Chinese restaurants make to \"use up\" the rest of the meat from the duck) don't taste good to me... at all. I much prefer China Chili or Great Wall's lettuce wrap filling even though I think Mekong's peking duck might be superior. Also, we once requested the banquet-style salad with shrimp, apples, melons, lychee, etc. which was a favorite of mine back in the days of China Doll, but it was not very good even though it was like $50+ for a small dish. I was very disappointed. Those are probably the only dishes I've had that I actually thought were bad. All others have been average to me.

Everything seems clean. Service is fine but we've definitely had some people who were pretty rude. Mekong is a solidly decent place to eat though there are better places to go for dim sum or dinner."}
{"text":"This is the best place in Phoenix for dim sum the good roast pork and roast duck as well as regular dim sum"}
{"text":"So all this time I had thought there were three dim sum restaurants in the valley - Great Wall, Phoenix Palace , and C-Fu.  Today, I found out I was wrong.  There's one in freaking Mekong Plaza!  To think I've frequented Mekong sooo many times in the past and just glossed over the fact that they had an awesome dim sum restaurant.  We went on a weekday at around 11 and it was pretty empty so it wasn't too surprising that only three of the carts were out.  We had our drinks orders attended to pretty much the second we sat down but the carts took a little bit to make their way over to us.

Comparing Mekong Palace to the other three (Great Wall, Phoenix Palace, and C-Fu), their steamed cart was good, loved their siew mai, they didn't have har gow when they came by (frownie), the BBQ pork buns were filled with pork and gravy and were also light and fluffy - I'd eat the entire plate myself, don't judge me.  The desserts were a little cold but still good - the custard in their custard bun is a little more liquified than others that I've had, but I thoroughly enjoyed it and their egg tarts were eggy with the right amount of sweetness.

Honestly, since I havent stopped by Great Wall or Phoenix Palace in a while, I don't know how I'd rank Mekong Palace against them (sorry C-Fu, you no longer make the list), but you know what, I think this calls for some research, ie. I might just have to swing by to get more dim sum this weekend!"}
{"text":"I am sad. Just because I ordered no. 32, not anything else (I guess), they asked me to sit outside of their tables. Which is in front of boba drink food court. I can't eat there on their table. It happened twice. I thought it just me but it's not right if you treat customers like this:(."}
{"text":"Nice selection and great customer service. Try the dim-sum on weekends but get there EARLY if you don't want to wait. Afterwards, ask for a mango pudding. It comes with a little evaporated milk on top and is oh so yummy!"}
{"text":"I've never had something from here that I've disliked. The salt and pepper calamari is my family's favorite. The food in San Francisco's Chinatown is on par with this restaurant. The lemon chicken is different, crispy and very sweet.

DO NOT waste your money with the hot pot. I've tried it twice and no matter what the food is always bland.  I've even over seasoned and still the food comes out to taste like nothing."}
{"text":"I waited for 45 minutes to try their dim sum and I was so dissapointed with the food. I thought I will eating some great food but food was not really that good. I don't know why people were saying that it's a great place to eat dim sum. I will not recommend this place to anybody."}
{"text":"Came here for Valentine's Dinner (because all of the local Asian markets sold out of Lobster) and that was our desired main course for dinner. The lobster is 15.00 per lb and it was just upsetting that they automatically tell you the lobster is 4.5 lbs exactly on the dot. It would be more comforting to see a receipt of the actually precise weight of the $65 lobster just to make sure we are truly getting what we pay for. However, the lobster was incredible and we had no complaints of how flavorful and delicious it was. It does not compare to the fresh lobster back in New York, but it was delicious I must tell you that much. It comes with a pot of rice and we got a coconut gelatin dessert at the end not sure if it's the usual thing they do or if it was a Valentine's Day special? We've been here once before for a wedding reception and the food was one of the best Chinese restaurants I've ever had here in Az. Would love to come try their Dim Sum another time!"}
{"text":"I love going to this place. Was first introduced to it earlier this year and then brought my picky parents here yesterday. Let's just say that we were stuffed by the end of our meal like a thanksgiving turkey. I would recommend going with someone that speaks Cantonese if you can. It's one of those really authentic places where everyone that works there is Asian and most people eating are also Asian. They bring out a different menu if you are Asian. Just like in in and out there is a special secret menu. Part of it is the duck trio. Duck three ways. First you get the large pieces of duck with the crispy skins that you eat on a pancake type bread. Then you get the duck soup made out of the bones with vegetables. Lastly you get the diced duck that you put in a lettuce leaf and make a lettuce wrap out of. Whatever you order you will not be disappointed. The only negative is the dessert (red beans) which is still yummy but not the star of the meal by any means."}
{"text":"Everytime I visit Phoenix, I always have to stop by here at least once before leaving back to Tucson. This place is delicious! I've came here with many friends and families and every one just loves the food here! The restaurant is located inside a big Asian supermarket, making it covenient to go shopping for Asian food right after you eat to digest or before you eat. I always order the PHO here and it's really delicious! The setting and workers are nice as well and this place is a definite place to go check out if you up in Phoenix looking for some good good. Take it from me, I really go here a lot! :)"}
{"text":"Dim Sum is great here. The people are on top of what they do, never run out of food or drinks. Highly recommend to anyone who is a fan of Asian cuisine!"}
{"text":"Oh!!!! Just love this place! So much to choose from. Fish, meats, condiments, fresh produce! Also, the food kiosks outside of the market. Delicious pho!"}
{"text":"I have been coming here for a couple of years now and I can't say that I have ever had a bad experience. If you want an authentic Asian experience Mekong Palace is the place. It's located in a little old fashioned mall, I call it 'the Asian mall' because all of the stores are Asian of some sort. They have a grocery store, a t-mobile store, a barber shop (which I also go to and like), an insurance agent, a travel agent, a food court, with several other restaurants that have dim sum, etc.... All serving the Asian community. My favorite is the big restaurant named after the mall itself, 'Mekong Palace Restaurant'. They also have a hot pot area, which I like too. You choose the broth and the different additional ingredients; meat, veggies, noodles etc. One thing I haven't seen is Sushi. But the variety is not lacking otherwise.
So if you want the area's closest thing to a Chinatown come here. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"This is my go-to place for dim sum. Mostly I love the environment here and it's pretty cheap to satisfy your dim sum cravings!!!! Nothing \"spectacular\" about the dim sum, but also nothing really wrong with the place, so I'm kinda wondering why the ratings are so low for this place! It's better than China king that closed down, and it's also better than C-Fu gourmet and Phoenix Palace! 

But yes the only thing I recommend is getting there at around 10:30am. After that, it gets PACKED and you won't be able to get anything you want, because it's either super busy and they ran out, or you'll just have to be waiting all day for that one cart to come around. This will sound horrible, but you need to have someone there that knows what they're doing! I always go with my wife and mom in law, who speaks Cantonese, and she orders food like a BOSS! They listen to her every time, and when they don't have something, she MAKES them get it. Lol

But overall, Mekong for dim sum is worth the prices compared to the other competitors. The only place that I will say is better is Great Wall but it's too far away!!!!"}
{"text":"Horrible customer service ever.!
if you order food by pound, make sure your server understands it correctly or not. Otherwise you will pay more than you think. Most of their employees do not understand English."}
{"text":"You will find this place in the Mekong Plaza near the food court on the right side. We went on a Saturday around 1pm. It was still busy but not terribly so, we were seated in less than 10min.
It's really your typical chinese dim sum place with the carts. The food was pretty good, we didn't run into any issues. Reasonable priced and the expected level of service. 
I was really happy to have found a dim sum place that had all my favorites: siu mai, fried taro, steamed and baked buns, sticky rice and much more
The place can get loud because its an open area in a food court but otherwise no complaints."}
{"text":"where did this place come from, I guess i'm not from Mesa so  I would never find this place on my own.  Step inside the Mekong Palace, it might look like another strip mall and as soon as you step inside your in  extreme Asian territory.  
I really can't ready everything.  

Ok keep walking it might seem deserted later in the day but the food court was poping when I was there.  there's defiantly a nice selection of small business and restaurants.  Mainly the Dim Sum and the Soup place is why I go there.  
Vietnamese place serves Hot Pot. meaning you buy veggies and meat and then everyone heats up their own soup. Installed for every seat at the tables is a little warming plate to cook your soup.  Kind of cool. Whatch out a few dollars here and there can really add up but for the most part very affordable. 
You also have to make your own sauce so make sure you do that right."}
{"text":"I went here on the 28th to celebrate the Chinese New Year with all of my family and couple friends.  This place fills up quickly soon after they open and we were one of the first people to arrive for the day and I'm glad that we arrived so early.  The food was excellent and service was fair.  

I'm a West Valley lady and this was quite the drive for me but well worth it.  There's a boba shop next door to satisfy your sweet tooth after your meal and an Asian supermarket and little shops in between to walk off the calories you've just consumed.  I would definitely come back as time allows."}
{"text":"Pretty standard dim sum. It's good, but not LA or Hong Kong good. The size of the pastry dishes (i.e. bbq pork bun or gai mei bao) were noticeably smaller. They also weren't melt in your mouth soft, but it tasted like it should taste. The lo baht go wasn't as flavorful and cold when we got it. The hahm sui got was on par. The location is interestingly inside an Asian shopping complex next to the food court. I like how it was brightly lit there and looked clean."}
{"text":"Probably my favorite place for dim sum, and they serve everyday!!! Shao Mai is a must having dish for me! Ingredients are fresh and favor are so good!"}
{"text":"I drive from tucson to have good dim sum. I like to go early because there is always a wait on Sundays. I'm not sure what it is about Sundays with Asians and having dim sum. I like to get the standard stuff. Hai Gow and shumai. 

I am gonna order a whole pig from them too."}
{"text":"I used to go here a lot... Over the past year the variety of dim sum has really shrunk... They also have a hot pot place attached to the regular restaurant.. never ever go there... The veggies were unwashed.. everything was bland and the manager is a total asshole... I will never be back again."}
{"text":"Dim sum cheaper than most places. For the price the dim sum are actually pretty good. Specially for the rice rolls. Service is slow and slow on purpose to piss off customers who order To-go. Limited selections on dim sum."}
{"text":"I go to this place with an hour drive from home.  Though I know that the restaurant is pretty authentic, especially on the weekends for dim sum.  Expect to wait for a long while to get seated and served.   Tonight, I went to the hot pot of the section of the restaurant, which I often go with friends.  And it is only open for 4 hours a nigh - 5pm to 9pm.  It's fun & a great conversational piece to have.  It's all you can eat, kind of Japanese style of shabu shabu.  EXCEPT tonight it was horrible.   all new staff and they depleted the menu by three quarters.  Most of the regular menu, most inexpensive portions, such as sliced rice cake, rice noodles, bok choy and white tofu are now gone.  What's the purpose of going.  Also, many , many other choices are gone on the hot pot menu.  And worst, the price went up $3 from the last time, which is still a great price, but not with three quarter of the menu choices gone.  So guaranteed this is the last time I eat hot pot at Mekong Palace restaurant, so sad."}
{"text":"We were at the market and were originally going to find somewhere to get some duck. While walking round we found this place and saw ducks hanging and said...let's try it. So we did!  We were finally seated!  Quickly viewed the menu. There were many options available. Yes we ordered duck!  Reasonable prices. The duck tasted wonderful. Came with rice and a plum sauce. We indeed enjoyed the duck. To finish the meal off they brought us a red bean soup. What a nice touch. The soup was slightly sweet. Very delicate. Nice. The service was good. Not one server smiled. Not one. One server looked like she was in pain. Kind of reminded me of a movie scene. We were served by 3 people. So if you want an up beat, friendly place...you may not find it here. In fact now thinking about it the place has a cool (chilly-cold) feeling.  Tile floor. Sparse furnishings.  Poor lighting and not on purpose!  Overall. We enjoyed the meal!"}
{"text":"Yum cha! Happy Chinese new years guys! What is new years? It's feasting with your family and friends. This is why our group of hungry adults decided to eat here Saturday morning. Come early to avoid the crowds, we were seated at 11am with less than a 5 min wait. 

Dim sum is ordering a bunch of Chinese appetizers that are typically steamed and fried and you drink lots of tea. They had chrysanthemum tea and kept our teapot full. The standouts were the turnip cake made fresh on the side & pork dumplings.
 
The staples that we ordered are: 
Har gow- shrimp dumpling! (my fave)
tseung fun- long shrimp rice sheet with soy sauce.
Luo bo gao-turnip cake! 
ham tsui gok- pork dumpling. 
lo mai gai- sticky rice 
Cha siu bao- BBQ bun 

If anything just wave down a waiter and point to the food you like.  Usually the people pushing carts should ask you what you want to order and should \"sell\" the dim sum to you like at a night market. It's very noisy but fun. However, here one of the cart ladies ignored us and skipped our table. To me it's still an interesting set-up that this dim sum place is just part of the Mekong food court but the food is not bad, so I'll take it."}
{"text":"Now i love going to the Mekong Plaza, especially to Unphogettable and the supermarket.  But i wanted some dim sum and heard the Mekong Palace in the back of the little mall had dim sum.  I was bringing along my nephew and was seated pretty quickly during lunch time.  Now I've been to allot of dim sum places in the Vally, and usually the dim sum carts usually come strolling to your table even before the drink order is placed.  Not here.  My drink order was taken and arrive but still no dim sum.  Even a waiter came by to ask if i wanted a menu like i just arrived.  I informed him that we wanted dim sum and said the cart would arrive shortly.  Now take in mind, there's about six tables eating during the lunch hour and only one dim sum cart going around.  So i decide to take a look at the dim sum and lunch menu in case it look a little longer.  The dim sum menu is pretty large and the cool thing about weekdays and most of the day, all of the dim sum items in the A,B or C columns are all 2.38.  The rest of the menu will cost 4.95.  
Finally after two cups of tea the dim sum carts arrives and the lady at the cart is showing me items that pretty much i don't want to try.  I only settle on three items, the shrimp dumpling, the pork and veggie dumpling, and baked rolls with BBQ pork inside.  I asked for the steamed pork buns but she said she will have it later.  Since she didn't have the steamed buns, i settled for the pork and rice wrapped in lotus leaf.  All were good but very unexpected because you can get that at any dim sum place.  
While eating i was looking at the menu, i noticed these soy sauce chow mein that look like something good.  It was 7.95 and didn't want a whole order so asked the waiter if i could get an order but a smaller portion.  The waiter said that he can make a dim sum portion for 4.95 and would be happy to get that order in!  That i was happy about and it took only a couple of minutes, which was quicker then the dim sum cart to come around!  Even thought i had to put in the order, the noodles were amazing, soft and crunchy with bean sprouts!  Great way to end my meal and my nephew loved the noodles as well.  Next time i come, it may just be for the soy sauce chow mein!
The service is pretty quick but can't say that for the dim sum carts.  But I'm gonna just look and see if there are more then one of the carts around before i have dim sum."}
{"text":"Update: This is the closest to the bay area you can get! They really make some real authentic Chinese food! I wrote a low star review about this place due to bad customer service from a certain employee but I hear she quit all by herself and I'm glad management is starting to realize how important customer opinions really are! Kelley is one of the waitress there and she always lights my experience every time I go there! If management can produce more people like her they would be very success! Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"We had a 10 course meal here as part of our conference buffet. 

As is the case with many such banquets the food was plentiful!! I don't remember all the food items but I'll do my best. 

The starter cold fruit salad with shrimps was okay. 

The crab meat soup was quite good. 

The lobster was absolutely divine. Flavorful and easy to get to. 

The ham and vegetables were delicious with the saltiness in the ham providing a great counter to the vegetables. 

The dish with the black (\"thousand year old\") egg was not bad. 

The book Choi with different tofu and meat was also delicious. 

The highlight besides the lobster was the steamed fish, which was incredibly fresh and delicious. 

The black bean paste dessert was ehh. But after such a filling meal even if it were great it would have been difficult to eat. 

The wine was not great but good enough. 

Excellent overall experience."}
{"text":"Our go to dim sum place as of right now. Located off the side of the food court inside Mekong palace shopping center.  No frills, expected semi aloof service, very little English here! They do not take reservations. Want a fork? We walk up and go get it. Need a box? That cart over across the restaurant have something you want? Walk up with your ticket to grab it before it's gone! You may get s dirty look but we do it all the time -it's like home :) 

This place is packed every weekend so make sure you get there super duper early otherwise you will wait a very long time! They also will run out of your favourite items that you've been craving-lol 

My favorites- 
Cha siu bao- bbq pork inside a fluffy white bun
There is also another version of this not in a fluffy white bun but a tan smooth bun that is also very good!
Shu mai - pork dumplings
Har gao- shrimp dumpling
Taro root ball- deep fried taro ball
(Footballs) this is what I call them lol- football shaped fried mochi with pork inside
Sticky rice in banana leaf
Gai lan- Chinese broccoli
Dan tat- egg custards
Pineapple buns - not really pineapple y but flaky bun with custard inside 
The shrimp balls with sugar cane handle 
Shrimp egg rolls

Dang it now I'm hungry for Dim sum!"}
{"text":"This is one of my Fave Dimsum places, but..... 

They changed up their Calamari recipe / process and now its large chunks n the breading falls off easily... The BBQ Pork also was way different this time, so I'm not sure what happened if, short staff for New Years or what,, but will try a few more times before concluding it and removed from FAVES... 

The Singapore style Rice noodles were the same n that saved the day... Other goto is their Chinese broccoli.. 

Until next time, !!"}
{"text":"Dim sum on one side, hot pot on the other. How can you go wrong? The times I've gone to dim sum was great. Hit the spot, and service was good. 

Last weekend, we tried the hot pot for lunch. Keep in mind, this is not the place to go when you're short on time. So if you're in a rush and decide to try hot pot, don't be a jerk and complain about the slowness. Hot pot is a time to relax, catch up with your peeps and enjoy the experience. 

I got the spicy broth. That's the only way to go. Otherwise, the herbal broth has no flavor. I still added more spices to the broth. We had udon and egg noodles, pot stickers, beef, lamb, tofu, meatballs, mushrooms, cabbage, and bok choy for 3 ppl. The bill came out to be $20 per person. Not bad considering that we were all full and still had a couple of to go boxes. I was still full 7 hrs later! 

I liked that we all had individual pots, you know, in case someone has bad habits and you don't want to share with them. The waitress was friendly and was always filing up our waters. It took us time to make our sauces, spice up the broths, and cook the food. We also didn't know that we had to pay at the front desk. We kept waiting for the waitress to pick up our credit card but she never did lol. 

All in all, a very good experience. Next time, we won't order so much food"}
{"text":"This restaurant has recently added new owners and I am now a bigger fan! Dim Sum service was a little smoother! Great taro and egg tarts! Will be our go to for east valley Dim Sum! 

The location is in the Mekong Plaza - large space, very mall like. It gets packed on the weekend so come early!!"}
{"text":"Always my go to for dim sum. Drink service could be better. But the key is to go early. We went at 10am last Sunday and everything was hot and fresh. It get packed fast. But portions are good sized and pricing is great."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner and dim sum. Dinner probably deserves 5 stars but dim sum was probably 3 stars, so I'll just average my experience to 4 stars. 

Food: 
Dinner: There's these dishes that are on sale right now for less than $10 and most of them are clay pot dishes (which are DELICIOUS!). All the dinner items we ordered were AMAZING! Especially the green beans! Those were flavored and stir fried to perfection! I've had this dish many times at many different places and this was by far the BEST green bean dish I've ever had! The clay pots were ALL amazing! Everything tasted SOOO GOOD! 

Dim sum: Not enough dim sum items and the ones that did show up were only ok. We were sitting around for a really long time and nothing would come. When the ladies did come by with the carts, they would not even try to sell us anything. We had to be all proactive and ask everyone what's in the carts. Even when we did that, the ladies would just say \"nothing new\" and push the cart away. We had to order things from the kitchen but even those things would take forever to come. A few of the dim sum dishes we ordered came AFTER we asked for our check and paid already. 

Service: 
Dinner: Great service! No complaints there!
Dim sum: REALLY SLOW...why was there no food??? 

Ambiance: 
This restaurant is in the middle of a food court of a shopping plaza. They just put up dividers to section off the \"restaurant\" from the rest of the food court. I was hesitant to eat at this place, but I'm glad I did because dinner was amazing! Dim sum...that's a different story. If you get over the fact that you are really sitting in the middle of a food court, then it's not so bad. 

Price: 
Both dinner and dim sum items were pretty cheap. 

Overall: 
I really liked eating dinner here! All the dishes were delicious! Dim sum probably would have been better if there was more food and the dim sum ladies were better about showing us what was available. I would totally come again for dinner but maybe not dim sum."}
{"text":"So while you shop at the grocery store....check out the awesome dim sum place inside......damn.....this is the best in Arizona so far. Lots of variety. Makes me want to sum dim.....hmmm...."}
{"text":"Best place in the valley for Dim Sum!! Take people you love and a friend who knows how to order = a great meal!!"}
{"text":"My roommate found this place off the beaten path and it made for a very interesting afternoon! Mekong Palace is hidden inside an Asian-influenced strip mall food court. 

We went for midday dim sum (small taster plates of lots of authentic and unique dishes). You have to mentally prepare yourself for the service--three waitresses with full carts will swarm you at once and offer you all sorts of treats. It's pretty overwhelming, but once the panic subsided we were left with a pretty nice spread on our table. 

Since I was pretty out of my element here, the only food I recognized was the chow mein (which was greasy and delicious). Some of the foods were one-time only buys (still not sure what kind of meat was wrapped in that egg roll casing) but others, like warm, yeasty pork rolls brought me to my knees. 

All in all you get a lot of fun variety for a very low price! Definitely will return!"}
{"text":"Oh my goodness ! The food is soooooopo yummy! Amazing for dim sum , I brought my parents and none of us had ever been there . It was so tasty and fresh . The service wasn't the best but I think only certain servers spoke English and they made up for it . I love this place ! I suggest the shrimp anything , the bbq short ribs bean sprout was amazing the sticky sesame balls were by far the best though! Yummmmmm I already want more !"}
{"text":"We've eaten here for lunch on many occasions.  We come for the dim sum and it is always delicious and satisfying.  We like the varieties of shaomai, noodles, and vegetables from the carts, and my wife also likes the chicken feet :).  The service is mostly attentive and efficient, but it does bog down a bit during the busy weekend hours.  The price is the best part, as our tab is usually in the low twenty dollar range for two before tip and we eat pretty well for this amount.  Mekong Palace is definitely worth a trip if you like dim sum."}
{"text":"I really like the dim sum here. They have a large variety and everything tastes good. Need to go early on weekends to minimize the wait time for table and get the fresh stuff off of carts."}
{"text":"This place probably had some bad reviews when they first opened up.  They probably were issues at that time.  

Anyway, My wife and I have been here many times as customers.  They have improved over the time, and are perhaps now respectable.  

Go on the weekends (Saturday or Sunday morning), and enjoy their dim sum.  It is good for Mesa AZ.  It is not like Hong Kong, but it is good.

Also, you should go there for the hot pot.  Wife and I went there yesterday for hotpot.  I suggest some kind of combination like the following:

Szechuan Pepper Broth
Chicken
Spinach
Vermicelli

Create a hotpot from this.  The only thing that I would recommend to Mekong Palace for the hot pot area, which you cook yourself at your table, is that they provide some recommended combinations on the hot pot menu based upon what they see being ordered.  This may make this more accessible and allow them to attract some adventurous non-Asian customers."}
{"text":"Finally found some decent dim sum! I would highly recommend going closer to open as the line gets long if you wait. Yummy little Chinese brunch tapas rolling by on steaming carts... what else could you need!? Best dim sum I've had in Az. Worth a try if you've got the craving."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place for dim sum AND hot pot in the Phoenix area!

Dim sum always has a wide variety of dishes fresh from the kitchen.  You HAVE to try the coconut jello, it's one of my favorite desserts.  The consistency is fluffy, and not quite like a jello.  It's hard to describe, but so delicious.  Plus, prices are CHEAP.  I can eat here with friends and leave stuffed and only pay $10 (including tip!).

Hot pot is also great and they qive you a lot of food in each order.  I love that each person gets their own individual pot to cook meat and veggies in, so each person can choose a different flavor broth if they want.  Plus vegetarians won't get their broth tainted by meat-eaters.

The only con is if you arrive at the busy time on the weekend, you will have to wait to get your dim sum.  Best to arrive around 10 or 10:30 to avoid the wait."}
{"text":"I haven't been here in a while and now I remember why. 
I have tried their hot pot. The best part about hot pot is that they have individual hot pots so you don't have to share with your table. There are few choices of broth to choose from. Also, hotpot can be enjoyed while ordering from dimsum menu as well. Best of both worlds. 
However, the dimsum is hit or miss. Couple of items came out hot, but most were lukewarm. Some of the cart pushers don't seem to come around while others come around too many times. 
I'd recommend coming early to get fresh/hot choices. Otherwise go for the hotpot."}
{"text":"Decent place in Mesa for dim sum. Came towards the end so they had to make some things fresh for me which was good but I usually like to look through the cart and pick out whatever items I want. Staff is a little difficult to understand. Food was prepared nicely and they had a good variety. The only problem was there in the Mekong Plaza and about 25% of the store say Mekong on it so if you're trying to find them they are in the middle of the plaza in doors. Will definitely go back and check it out another time earlier in the day. They stop serving at 2:45"}
{"text":"Mekong Palace is definitely my choice for dinner and dim sum, ALWAYS.  While there's no solid walls perse, the decor and ambiance is decent.  How can you not love the cleanliness?

Dim sum:  The prices are a steal for the quality that you get.  Food is fresh, dumplings are big [that's what she said], and the food is just downright amazing.  It doesn't matter if you're the first for dims sum or the last, the food is always fresh.  Service is always superior and your tea pot is never left empty for more than a couple minutes.  Those kids are on the ball about keeping the pot filled!  I love their seasonal items like the little fried sweet potato balls of heaven and their special items are always exciting to try.  Food is genuinely authentic and I love it here!

Dinner:  Dinner is just as great.  Mekong Palace is the only place to go for Peking Duck.  While other places makes a delicious bird, they usually just give you the skin only with the buns.  At Mekong Palace, they hook it up.  You get the skin for the buns of course but they also prepare two more little dishes with the price of the one dish:  You get lettuce wraps and the duck meat itself.  It's DELICIOUS!  Food at dinner is just as amazing and the portions are gigantic.  This is definitely my favorite place to go when I want some Chinese food [well, here and my mama's house]."}
{"text":"If options for more traditional Chinese is what you're looking for, look no further!

I originally came by this place because it was the closest grocery store to where I was living at the time. The produce is excellently priced for the frugal folk, but I digress.

There are sides of pigs and roasted ducks hanging behind glass windows, a great start. The roast duck is my favorite item hands down! That with some rice will satisfy me, but there is so much more! They have an extensive menu with staples like orange chicken, to some stuff that I've honestly never heard of. They also have a very highly reviewed and praised dim-sum daily. I haven't been there for the fresh services but I've been luck enough to find some of the leftovers. After the regular service some of the remainders are sold at the to go CPU red for a mark down and every time I've had the chance I've gambled on those items. Some have been weird and some have been absolutely amazing!!"}
{"text":"Not sure what the deal is with this place now. Two years ago before I left AZ, the food and service was pretty good. Went to Mekong on a recent AZ trip, the food was bland and the service was god awful. The waiter spilled boiling soup 6 inches away from my grandfathers lap and we had to ask for the check and  togo boxes for the leftovers at least 4 Times.

Suggestions, bring your own boxes and wear a bib."}
{"text":"I'm giving you full disclosure that I'm writing this review based on taste and authenticity from a comparative perspective because that's what I value as a Chinese gal that grew up on dim sum. Phoenix doesn't have a strong Chinese food game, let's be honest. If you want the most decent, closest to authentic dim sum in the area, this is the best place. I use to really like Phoenix Palace but ever since the time they shut down randomly, it hasn't been the same. C-Fu Gourmet has never been good. I went once and definitely didn't need to give it another chance. Someone in an earlier review mentioned how things are frozen and steamed here at Mekong. I won't make a generalized statement about that but clearly, they haven't been to the aforementioned dim sim places (Great Wall is decent but it's so far). Also, let me just say, I don't want to hate on Phoenix Palace because they were my one for many years but I have to give my loyalty to Mekong now. Variety of items are good, flavors are good, portions are good, prices are good. Service will always be terrible but that's not why I go, lol!

I have also been here for dinner numerous times. I once had a waiter say to me, \"Ay ya, weren't you just here yesterday?\" I responded with *shifty eyes*, \"Maybe...\" The waiter wasn't wrong. I'll save that review for another time."}
{"text":"Inexpensive and delicious din sum! Usually pretty crowded early Saturdays and Sundays!"}
{"text":"Definitely a restaurant you need to eat at multiple times to get the right way to cook your food and experiment what is the best way to add different combinations together. 

You can get your own individual soup to cook the food to fondue your selection of food. 

Would suggest asking for multiple rice bowls to mainly get spices, herbs and oils.

Select your soup base, meats, fish, vegetables,  noodles and tofu.

We ordered the Rib Eye which I would not recommend,  fish fillet, egg noodles,  headless shrimp,  won ton which was a winner,  mushrooms and Chinese celery. 

Get your soup to a good boil and add the food you want to cook and scoop out what you eat.

You will need to be a little organized with your eating tools so you could remove from the boiling water.  The spoon is helpful but the chopsticks and pincher are the best tools to get your food.

Will comeback again and add more flavoring to the soup and dipping."}
{"text":"Mekong is always pretty busy around lunch time on the weekends so I try to get there earlier, around 10:30 or 11. The food is great, consistent, and inexpensive. Where else would you be able to feed 5 people a large, non-fast-food lunch for around $50? There is less variety in the dishes than you would get at a similar place on either coast, but it is still my go-to dim sum place in the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"I haven't been here a while for dim sum and i have to say....I am disappointed at the service. I came in with a group of 19 people. As soon as everyone arrived, it took them 15-30 minutes to come by with normal selection of Dim Sum (Steam bun, chicken feet, shrimp noodles, etc). I literally had to ask for carts to come by over and over again. Finally, I got so frustrated that i walked around the entire place to grab the food. When it was time to pay the bills, it took them nearly 15 minutes before coming by to let us know what the total was. Again, I had to stand there until they gave it to me. 

Unless this place is my last resort for dim sum, i'll not come back here again."}
{"text":"Hummus portions. We ordered a fried rice and Singapore rice noodles and some dimsum. Everything tasted good.  But the portions were huge! I think next time, we need to just order half of what we would in any restaurant.

Service is non-existent."}
{"text":"This place has some of the best dim sum I have yet found in Az (NOT the best dim sum, just the best in this area....) But, unfortunatly, somewhat poor service. 

Actually, I'm not really sure what happened...I've been here a few times before, but the other day when we came by to eat, I had never seen it so busy! Maybe because of the holidays?? Anyways, they were definitely understaffed, if not out front, for sure in the kitchen......They didn't even have half the available dim sum dishes as they normally have. Plus, as another reviewer experienced, we were sat in the back near the stage, and barely got to see the carts come through to us. When they did make it to our table, the best dim sum was gone. 

Funny thing, my favorite dish is BBQ pork bun. They, for some reason, were not coming around with them. So, finally I asked the maitre'd if there was any available, she said there was, and she would bring us out an order shortly. Well, the cart lady came around and I tried to tell her we had the buns coming (by pointing to the item on the menu, and signaling that it was coming) she laughed at me! And shook her head, 'no! no!' indicating that I was nuts! Whatever, I guess she was the nutty one, because they did bring out the buns just for our table. (see, they aren't that bad!....just, apparently, communication between themselves is just as bad as the communication with their English speaking customers!....)

To sum up, for me, the dim sum is worth any of the misstreament one may go through in order to get it. At least until I can visit Chinatown in New York, or if by some miricale, a new dim sum place opens up here offering even better food (and at least kinder service...)"}
