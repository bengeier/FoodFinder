{"text":"If I could give this place -1 star I would. Some of the staff there are not comfortable with diversity who regularly frequent the bar. We decided to go here for wing night which if you know this place, the service is extremely slow. We told our waitress we were going for a smoke to save our drinks and booth. The waitress decide to believe that we skip out on her after we told her this. She cleaned up our unfinished drinks and gave our booth away. After finishing our smoke we proceeded to return to our seat, with was no longer available and the waitress loudly saying I thought you guys walked out. Well surprised we didn't. As we watched many other customers leaving their seats to smoke without incident.The most uncalled thing she made up in her mind. Will not be returning unless this place gets rid of unprofessional staff!"}
{"text":"The music is often too loud. I get it, it's a bar, but sometimes it can be ridiculous shouting to be heard across a table.
The food is decent and the wait isn't great but I'm not sure it merits the horror expressed in some of the other reviews.
The patio bar is shielded in the winter, which is good for the smokers in your group.

The Part I Find Most Annoying
Warning: The waitresses have been trained or something to SIT DOWN IN YOUR BOOTH and flirt in a very familiar way when taking your order (provided you come in with a group of mostly/all guys). They also will try to push shots on your group every 5 minutes or so.

Some guys may like this. Some guys may LOVE this. I certainly do not."}
{"text":"Pizza is cheap - really dry crust, though. 

Bartenders are cool, I never had an issue getting service. One girl hula hoops on the bar. I liked that. She has a robust physique. 

Drank a cheap craft beer and left. Ill stop by again sometime."}
{"text":"Went here because I had heard the pizza was excellent. People had raved about the crust, but complained about wait times and service. 
We waited about 40 minutes for pizza and wings. 
Our server was friendly, though she got the draft beer order wrong. We ordered dortmunder and got miller. 
The pizza - I Have had cafeteria pizza better than this pizza. The sauce was terrible and the crust was doughy. I was very disappointed. I was told the pizza was worth the wait. It was NOT. I will never step foot in this place again."}
{"text":"I have visited this establishment for lunch and for late night fun! The lunch specials are crazy yummy and the pizza is a must! This is my go to bar when in the Willoughby area.. they continue to make nice upgrades and it's a comfortable atmosphere where everyone is welcome! They also always seem to have a fun event going on, I have had a birthday party there, they are very giving when you schedule your party, I had just planned to go there bc it was a fun place but with what they give you for bringing in a large group really makes you feel appreciated! Great neighborhood bar!"}
{"text":"The pizza at FAT's is REALLY good... however the service is pretty terrible.  I have been there on numerous occasions and I have had to wait for a waitress/bartender to acknowledge me for way too long.  The bartenders seem to be off in their own little world - flashing and kissing each other and yelling semi-obscene things... which is fine for them, I don't really care about that stuff, but if I have to witness it, I'd like a beer, please. 
Also, the patio is nice, but a little too small for the claustrophobic in me."}
{"text":"Great \"townie\" bar. Has great pizza and great wings, Go on a wing night but be ready to wait. place is packed a lot of times. Cant complain about wings taking a while when the point is to get people in to drink. You cant expect full size wings for 10 cents to come out in 10 minutes so you can eat and leave. The people sitting next to us drinking water were complaining on the wait time. Cute bartenders that are good. Even when Ive been here with a packed bar I still received service pretty fast. Last time i went i found out they service huge pieces of pizza for 2 bucks late at night after the kitchen closes. Nothing like get a slice of pizza thats still hot at 2am. Dont come here expecting a fancy martini with fresh fruit and a new york strip. Come wanting a huge mug of cold beer and some good greasy food while making some new loud friends."}
{"text":"Unless you are a 20-something, single, macho-acting guy: don't expect good service (if ANY service) at all.  I have been here a few times and experienced the same situation over and over again.  I guess they get regulars since (most of) the female bar-tenders dress as if they wished they worked at Hooters.  I get it: cleavage = tips....for some people.  I was a bar-tender for over a decade.  I tip very well when service is good.  I don't care about your tits.  What I care about is polite and attentive service.  When my simple pizza is taking over 45 minutes to arrive and there are only about 8 other people in the bar I expect you to say something to me.  Go ahead: make your money by showing skin.  I bet people like me are better tippers when acceptable service is provided."}
{"text":"I love Frank & Tony's. I love their pizza and they have a decent beer selection. It's a great blue collar bar. A place where the music is loud and the atmosphere laid back. 

What I don't love is the service. It varies on every visit. This time it was more tolerable waiting for our pizza because we ordered some appetizers first. They arrived promptly, about 10 mins after ordering. The pizza arrived about 25 minutes after. 

Our waitress was very nice and sweet, though the sense of urgency just wasn't there. I feel bad even saying that because I know she meant well. But she needed a bit more pep in her step. 

Overall folks, if you go to this bar don't expect 5 star service. You will be waiting for your food, but it will be worth it once it arrives. Give this place a chance."}
{"text":"Yummy wings great inexpensive drinks.  Not the top of town so come as you are. Pizza is cheap. Big slices I prefer meatball and banana peppers"}
{"text":"Not a very good bar I have went their a few times and it seams that the bartenders friends get preferential treatment I waited 15 min to get her to come down the bar to serve me with a bad drink and worse attitude and I was 1 of 6 people in their  and stay away on the weekend full of underage people if I can post vid I would of three girls bragging that this is the place to get served underaged in Willoughby they were 18 but now the good place was clean and wings are good"}
{"text":"I have never actually had a good time at this place. Always far too crowded on weekend nights and full of the types that will touch you \"accidentally\". 

Service is so-so, if not just plain bad. And I have friends that work here. Sorry guys! 

I'm only giving FAT's (what the DTW folk call it) 3 stars because I LOVE their pizza. It is seriously good. Hard to believe, I know. Call ahead to order one, expect to wait for over an hour even when they're dead, but still... wait for it because it's really good. And getting one slice after you're drunk is just not the same. The crust is different. You have to order the whole damned pizza to  really enjoy it. 

There's a week night (Mondays maybe?) were they do $5 pizzas and $1 drafts. So worth it. Other than that, I'd never eat here."}
{"text":"Pretty good food and waitresses, but the happy hour patrons are not what I would expect after visiting  many other downtown Willoughby establishments. Loud, sloppy and overall very inconsiderate of their surroundings. Crowd may change as the night progresses, but not waiting around to see."}
{"text":"Not so great. I've been here a couple times and I'm not sure why I went back after the first visit. One of the bartenders was really short and rude with me for no reason. The outside bar would be nice potential bonus expect you feel like you're in a tiny metal cage with the smokers. 

Lot of bar seats at the bar and casual, but there are so many better places to visit in Willoughby."}
{"text":"Your typical hole in the wall bar they have 20 cent boneless wings on Thursday and 20 cent bone in wings on Wednesday's.  They have like half ounce shots which isn't on the service staff that's on the cheap ownership.  It's owned by the same group who owns the Garage Bar and Anderson's.  Not a bad spot though the bartenders are always awesome."}
{"text":"Fun place to hang out with friends. Great micro brew list & options on tap. I can see why they were voted best pizza. I've never found the wait times too long when ordering food. Staff has always been really friendly. Awesome happy hour with $1.25 beers. Great alternative to a lot of the higher priced options in Downtown Willoughby. If you haven't been here yet, definitely worth a visit!"}
{"text":"Is it possible to give no star? Came here during the Willoughby Chocolate Crawl and they were a hot mess! Bartenders were oblivious to ppl waiting for service. If you miss a college dive bar this is the place for you, but if you want service or a drink or anything - go somewhere else!"}
{"text":"Before reading, know this, FAT's is perfectly safe, its clean, and by no means does my review reflect the inside decor of this place.  I would go there 5 days a week if I didn't live 15 minutes away and if they would just have a friendlier bar crowd after hours and a more attentive bar staff.  

That said, keep reading.

3 stars for the $1.25 happy hour beer specials and the long bar that allows you to find a seat during.  I have had their pizza and it is good.  I also dig the free popcorn.  Some of the wait staff are sssllllllooowwww and it seems that they ignore you if they do not recognize you as a regular or it could be that the staff is unable to withhold more then one or two beer orders in their head before forgetting.  Don't know, its annoying, but the beers are cheap.

It does get pretty full at night with younger kids and some semi goth types.  The music later at night is something that you wouldn't find on any local radio stations or on ANY of my cd's / mp3's.  Its a slightly lighter version of death music like suicidal tendencies or sepeltura but a tad harder then Metallica, regardless, that too is annoying.

On a high note, they do have daily specials like AYCE crab, $5 pizza, $.25 wings, etc.  I just am never there past 8 on the weekday to enjoy these specials.  Wings were OK when I had them once and a bearded, 75 year old man sitting next to me had a sausage sandwich that looked pretty good.

Go for the beer.....then do yourself a favor and move on to a finer establishment in downtown Willoughby."}
{"text":"I used to really love Frank n Tony's. The food is surprisingly good, however the service is horrid. I swear the only hire high school drop outs that are stoned and illiterate. The girls behind the bar do a decent job, but the servers and cook are the slowest human beings on the planet. Used to insist friends and I go there, now it's a last last resort. F."}
{"text":"$3.75 for a miller lite bottle!? How does a place that smells like an ashtray when you are inside and looks like a dive bar , charge almost the same price as progressive field for a miller ($4). Many places downtown Cleveland have beer for $2-3. Save your wallet and stay away"}
{"text":"Saturday was a birthday bar crawl for my pa in law(or as i now refer to him, Glam-Pa). It was dusk as we went out to the patio at this usually obnoxious teen bar.(whoops, i mean 21 and over) . There were maybe three people out there. Very serene. 
I ordered a plastic bathtub of sunset wheat, because apparently you can't get a standard pint at shit bars anymore. Ten minutes later every a-hole in Willoughby showed up. A dick in zombie makeup, a bachelorette party and other assorted aggressive alpha male chumps. I was forced to chug my tub so that we could get the hell out of there. Maybe it's because i was hanging with 55 year old men. They have no patience for that stuff. Me, i could have hung around a little longer. Oh well. I used to have fun here when i was 25. 

One thing i liked was they were using a flat screen to display pictures of patrons from nights past. Doesn't sound original, but i've never seen it in action before. Maybe they'll have a picture of me frowning on there."}
{"text":"I've sat inside on a weeknight and had appetizers as well as did a carryout pizza. Both times the food was really good! The service is pretty prompt. We had to wait an extra 10 minutes for our pizza but it wasn't a huge deal. I think a little update to the décor or seating would be nice but the food is good! Parking can be a bit of a pain. I haven't figured out the area enough yet to know where the \"good\" spots are. The parking lot next to the bar costs $3 to park. You can then go anythere around town but it's still kind of silly to pay. Overall a decent experience at the bar!"}
