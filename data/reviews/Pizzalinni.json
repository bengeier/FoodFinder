{"text":"\"Just letting all you West Island people know that you must be VERY careful if you decide to order from Pizzalinni. I ordered some food there today and 1 - the order was wrong. No biggie, right? Well, upon inspection of the bill before I called them back, I realized I was overcharged by $10.00. When I called them to explain, I was told that it was MY OWN FAULT because I hadn't asked for and checked the prices before hand. I was told that it is MY responsibility to make sure their employees do not over charge. I told the owner that I don't feel it is my responsibility to monitor their employees and may I please have the money back that they overcharged me. The owner said \"No Way! It's my money now and do not ever call here again.\". I may not know much about business, but I'm pretty sure that's not the way it should work. I have a feeling that this is common practice for this restaurant. They were too quick to be on the defensive.......  Isn't that robbery? If I walked into their restaurant and took 10$ out of their till, I am pretty sure they would call the police. SO my friends, be careful when ordering from this restaurant. Not only do they get your order wrong, they also steal from you. Flat out steal from you! And then blame YOU for their employees mistakes. Disgusting! The address to avoid is: Pizzalinni 3626 St. Charles blvd. Kirkland, Qc. \""}
