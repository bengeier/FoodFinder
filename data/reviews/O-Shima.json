{"text":"One of the prettier sushi restaurants in Calgary. Their rolls are a bit more innovative than I've seen in other places in town, and food quality and service are both good, which is to be expected because they're a bit pricier as well."}
{"text":"Let's get ready to rawk some rolls! The fact that Oshima's sign is so weathered looking made me think I was in for a bit of an old dive as far as sushi joints go. I'm thankful that wasn't the case!

I walked through the front door (there's one in the back as well from the parking lot) to find myself in a clean looking place. I don't just mean clean in terms of the floors being washed, the tables were set nicely, the decor was uncomplicated, the lighting was neither too bright nor too dark. 

I ordered the sushi sashimi lunch combo and a pot of tea. With it, I chose a spicy tuna roll. It had just enough kick on the spicy part! The lunch combo also came salad and miso soup. I left full and satisfied. 

It was a late lunch, and I was the only one in the restaurant. Sometimes, that means your server forgets about you or doesn't check back on you as frequently because they're busy doing other things. Not here, I was well taken care of. Thanks Oshima! I'll be back to try your 3 rolls for $10 special soon!"}
{"text":"O Shima is still hanging in there! I had lunch at O Shima yesterday and was as almost always blown away- now I do order a la carte which gets pricey, but for what I consider the best nigiri sushi in Calgary it's worth it. I got an order of chicken karaage (LOVE the spicy mayo on the side!) and three each chili gomae ebi (this is gunkan style- other places call it cajun prawn), spicy tuna (the gunkan one- not the roll- this is much better, more tuna and a nice spicy mouthful) and inari. That was a lot of food and every bite was delectable."}
