{"text":"Ive gone to this place for about a year now. Under the previous owners, the customer service and the food portion sizes were better. Whereas I feel like now its declining because of angry-ish servers who smother the oh so small bites of meat with sauce (which is pretty good though). The price to food ratio is pretty high compared to other pita land locations but they are not bad and conveniently consistent."}
{"text":"Shawarma ok , price ok... not the cheapest. The only reason we go back with friends or colleagues at noon is because of the belgian lady  (\"jasmine\" maybe?), she is honest and give a real customer service. I went at night few times and the team was crazy RUDE! nothing in the sandwich only rice and few pickles and a little bit of dry meat. Is like it s not the same fast food the day or the night. Tips: take souvlaki or falafel (no shawarma) and baklawa (sweet) on day time. They are good even if it s more expensive and the girl at noon is very nice!

{"text":"I am obsessed with Shawarmas and usually don't like chain places like Pita Land but this location is different. The chicken shawarma is so tasty and juicy. Not dry like other places. And their garlic sauce is soooo good. Make sure to try the potatoes and ask for extra garlic sauce on the side to dip them in! Even more important than the good food is the service. Fast, friendly and always in a good mood. Love going here."}
{"text":"I wish there was a negative star review.
Generic food. And everything is an extra cost.
Which they don't tell you until you ask for a receipt on your over priced meal. 

Check out Hakka around the corner. They have a better value."}
{"text":"Yum! Just had the chicken shwarma wrap, and was pleasantly surprised! This was my first time there so I didn't know what to expect. It was a perfect size, nicely warm/toasted and it a great sauce with some spice to it. I will definitely be back :)"}
{"text":"Nasty stuff. One of the worst shawarmas I've had in Mississauga. The toppings are bland and the chicken made me nauseous."}
{"text":"Very good Middle-Eastern food. Chicken Shwarma, not dry, but very tasty!"}
{"text":"Not great

Come for the cold, lifeless shwarmera.

Stay for the cold, lifeless whooors.

Just kidding... or AM I?

{"text":"Good food? But their very stingy, they don't even wanna give u more tomatoes or anything when u ask for it, and when they do give u more? Its still not enough, i want what i pay for, i pay what your asking for your food? Give me what i want and how i like it!!! Simple"}
{"text":"I ordered a Chicken souvlaki wrap. They were cheap with the chicken, 5 tiny pieces. The huge chicken roasting kinda has you drooling until they give you so little. Taxes in the wrap is 9$. Probably won't be coming back. It tasted pretty good though."}
{"text":"Came here today for lunch and was quite disappointed - the meat was extremely salty and the toppings were minimal...definitely not the best shawarma place around."}
{"text":"This place used to be good years ago but its gone down a steep hill. The shawarma toppings are not fresh and the spreads are tasteless. Not worth the value."}
{"text":"Went here last Sunday and was extremely impressed by the cleaniness and service. Workers wear gloves. the owner greeted us with free cookies. Reasonably price and very fresh."}
{"text":"I'd like to consider myself a shawarma connoisseur. I've sampled it on three continents. That, and I grew up in Ottawa - need I say more? If you've been to Ottawa, you know what I mean.

These shawarmas are the best I've ever had. The garlic sauce is absolutely heaven, and they absolutely drown the thing in it if you ask them. The veggies are bountiful and fresh. The chicken is unadulterated  and not too salty; a welcome improvement on most of the shawarma I've had in the city. Keep an eye out for the crispy chunks that have been frying for a longer time; those are the flavour jackpot. $6 is kind of a lot for the size of the sandwich; although as I have learned over the years, being a repeat customer might up your portion size.  The shawarma plate is a better value if you're famished, and just as delicious."}
{"text":"Open late, great portion sizes for a reasonable price. The front looked clean and I was served quickly. I've only tried the chicken shawarma so far, but it was delicious. Got the plate with rice and potatoes, which were amazing."}
{"text":"My wife and I both had the chicken pita and it was fantastic! We each had the tedziki sauce and hot sauce on both pitas. Delicious! We will be going again soon."}
{"text":"This is the best shawarma place ever. Thank God, they're open till 3am on Friday & sat and until 2am every other day. 

Not just their business hours are good. Their food is amazing. Customer service is great. Special sauce is one of a kind. I've tried so many shawarma places and this sauce on top of them all. It's not a regular tahini sauce. They have their own special ingredients in it. Chicken is their speciality and it's always juicy and cooked properly. I always get the plate. With garlic potatoes on the side with hot and special sauce on it. 

Store is always clean and so is the kitchen area. Definitely recommend it to anyone who's in the area. They're so busy yet you still get your food within 5 mins."}
{"text":"I'm addicted to the falafels here....my husband has been eating falafels for years and I tried it in London, ON where we're from and didn't like them much, but then after trying the ones at this Pita Land I've suddenly become addicted. This place is conveniently close to us, the service is great (once they stuffed my falafel too full and it was falling apart so they remade it no questions asked) and the staff are friendly, they are open very late into the early morning which suits us because we work shift work, and the taste is superb - juicy and fresh, they always pack my falafel full and are happy to put extra sauce. I can't get enough of the falafels at this place."}
{"text":"Good falafel, definitely the best of the three places near Spadina and Bloor. Delicious potatoes!"}
{"text":"Chicken shawarma was a actually quite nice.  You don't usually expect that from a franchise."}
{"text":"Came here with a co-worker a few times for lunch and constantly stoping by to grab a shawarma. Great price - one of my favourite places to buy a shawarma while on the go"}
{"text":"Always busy. Especially at lunch time. Love their food. Big portions and full of flavour. Makes you want to go back everytime but unfortunately it's too expensive and I feel like it's overpriced. $15-17 for a chicken green salad that's crazyyyyy!!!"}
{"text":"Pita Land makes a pretty good falafel, and its cheap.  Good service and hardly ever have to wait in line."}
{"text":"There is Medina Grill in Vaughan Mils, there is Grill for You right outside Vaughan Mills for good shawarma.

For okay to bad Shawarma go to Pita Land. The food was bad. The service was  ho hum. 

I ordered a shawarma sandwich and a chicken plate. The chicken was cold. I asked for extra tabuli and extra turnips - got nothing. I don't think I ever buy from this location again.

The best shawarma in Toronto is Ali Baba on Lakeshore close to Dundas. Grill for U near Vaughan Mills is a close second but their customer service leaves a lot to be desired."}
{"text":"The food here is not good. It is unbelievable how greasy it is. I had a shawarma sandwich and the grease was just pouring out of it. I also had the potatoes and they were swimming in grease. Also, the chicken is bland and does not taste good at all. Shawarma is supposed to be healthy not junk food."}
{"text":"Ordered a Falafel Wrap... 

Poor service
cold food. 
Terrible experience 



Will not return to this location."}
{"text":"the place is like a dream come true! Great staff for awesome food. I wish I lived closer."}
{"text":"Pita Land's falafel is a must-have every time I go to Toronto. Exceptionally salty and garlicy, with a satisfying crispiness, it's the ultimate comfort food. The staff are usually pleasant enough, and the food is ready very quickly."}
{"text":"The meat is very tasty, the pitas/wraps, delicious.    I believe it's the sauce.

The staff is friendly, they make you  feel @ home."}
{"text":"I used to be a regular customer. But I got sick the last time I had their chicken shawarma.. Buuu"}
{"text":"Decent, nothing spectacular but tasty and fresh. The guy operating the till could use some customer service skills though, had a real attitude with guy in front and behind me for very minor issues."}
{"text":"I came from the US to Mississauga for a short visit and tried the food at Pita Land. The place is nice clean and neat with warm colors and welcoming staff. The food was very good and I can say I've never tasted such delicious shawarma before. Same thing with the chicken kabob it was juicy and tasty. The food there is authentic Mediterranean/Middle Eastern (Tasteful and flavorful). I wish we had such quality place in Virginia or DC area. I'd never eat anywhere else in town in all my future visits."}
{"text":"Cant beat this place for their food - service is kind of slow so if you see a few other people in there, expect to wait. But believe me, that chicken shawarma is worth it."}
{"text":"The sandwiches keep getting smaller. A pita with extra meat (extra $ too) still seems smaller than what their regular pita used to be. It's a shame, because their shawarma still tastes good"}
{"text":"I haven't noticed in any other reviews any comments about the prices. This was the first shawarma i ate after moving here (p.s  I am a schawarma connoiseur). It wasnt too bad except the price was way way too high. For a chicken sandwich with both olives (extra 50 cents) it cost over 9 dollars. for a tiny sandwich of no great taste that's nuts.......go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Had a gyro and samosas. Tasted good. Not the best, not the worst. Seemed expensive although I can't remember the last time I had a gyro and how much I paid for it, LOL."}
{"text":"I visited this establishment on Monday and I had the upmost horrible experience imaginable. My friends and I visited this location after a few drinks, associating us with the drunk people who came in just prior and treated us with the same extreme ignorance. This location closes at 4:00 am and we were in at 3:20, only three of us and at first they refused to serve us and said they were closed. Then when we told them they were still open according to their hours they began to take our order. When my friend proceeded to pay they refused to take his money because the edge ripped off as he was taking it out of his pocket. Now noting that the complete serial code was still intact and the corner of the new bill was still in his hand as well I informed them it was against the law to decline the bill for such a reason, it is still currency. Once I said this the short plump man who refused to give his name yelled at his go worker to throw out at pita and threatened my friend by jerking the pita at his face. When I asked for his name he told me, and I quote, \"it's none of your f***ing business, get the f*** out, I'm calling the police.\" I waiting for the people police outside to file a report against the man but no police ever came and they closed the shop half an hour early. 

My friends and I, who give them great business will not be returning back. Who knows what will happen night time, he might not just threaten us...

If anyone has information on this mans name I would appreciate as I have filed a report."}
{"text":"So, for four odd years I used to walk past this joint (fondly and formerly known as La Zeez) without once stopping in to try. Finally, this past week I ducked in to give a shot with a friend who was very pro-La Zeez. 

Was about 3 pm on a Sunday and it was still relatively busy considering the awkward hour. We were both starving, so he went for the Chicken Shawarma plate, deemed \"huge\", even for him. I stuck with the Chicken Shawarma in a pita wrap. Key observation: they throw the slices of chicken back on the grill after shaving it off the spit. Quick friendly service, and for both meals it came to about $15. 

Ate the meal in their bizarre covered patio complete with (fake?) plants and a television. Nice view of all the cops stopping in the front to get their food fix on the go. As I watched my better half dig into a big square styrofoam container overflowing with a heaping serving of pickled and fresh veggies, rice, and a robust serving of chicken, I took a bite of mine. Really good, especially when I was blessed with a taste of the crispy flavourful ends of the chicken. Another bonus - there are plenty of vegetables and herbs in there to keep it tasting fresh and crispy. Nice balance of cool, crispy vegetables and pickled radish with the savoury warm, and also juicy, chicken. Hot sauce recommended.

With all the other shawarma offerings in the area, this one is definitely one to come back to."}
{"text":"Okay....  Being from east coast, it's a pretty big deal that I think I had the best Shwarma I have ever eaten today!  Along with perfect fries and amazing service.  Will
Definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This is by far the best Pita Place in the Durham Region and GTA. Chicken and Gyros is always cooked perfectly, the workers treat you like you've been there a million times before (I definitely have), and the potatoes are perfect. Can't go wrong at Pita Land Ajax. Seriously. The Chicken Shawarma plate is the best bang for your buck. With some hot sauce over the chicken and Italian dressing for the salad. 

Customer for Life."}
{"text":"This place has good food but the quality is off sometimes. Normally I get a chicken shawarma wrap which is food except for the fact that you have to pay for the majority of the toppings. It's worth trying if you don't mind the price."}
{"text":"This place is on the way home from work so once in a while I will pop in. I always see a help wanted sign on the door and always see different students working there mostly from South America. The food is so so and the service is slow and no one smiles or are that friendly- only when the owner is in i noticed everyone is on their best behavior which is pretty funny to see, he's really nice but not in often.

I either get the chicken shawarma or the falafel wrap-both the chicken and falafel wraps seem to get smaller in size every-time I'm there- they also seem pretty stingy with the falafels for some reason I noticed and its always crumbled or broken into crumb size and then sprinkled in the wrap- weird.. 
At the end of the day it's just ok..I've had way better that's for sure..."}
{"text":"I love coming to this location. I always get the Chargrill BBQ Chicken. It always tastes so delicious. Alex makes it the best every time we go there. Love love love this place!"}
{"text":"I heard a lot about this place and really wanted to try it. Plus I had some coupons so I thought why not. Ended up paying $11.26 in total (with $2 off coupon) for the chicken shawarma saj wrap (comes with pickles and garlic potatoes). 

Pros: Friendly staff, a large serving which is expected with that price, quick service, and a clean area. It's 100% halal which is great too! 

Cons: The food. I use to live in the middle east so I know good shawarma and this just didn't meet the expectations everyone else set. It was good but not amazing. I also wish they gave some extra sauces on the side so that the wrap wouldn't get so soggy, it's pretty big and by the time I got to the third part (they slice it for you), it was all really soggy and falling apart. 

Overall, if someone else is buying it then great, i'm down to enjoy it. But I personally won't be going to this place to buy food for myself or others."}
{"text":"Beef Shwarma was pictured in a pita, and I didn't get that.  Just shaved compressed meat on lettuce.  Who the hell wants that?  

Guy, sell what you advertise, ok?"}
{"text":"Best shawarma I have found in Toronto so far. The shawarma is a bit more expensive than other places, but in exchange you get a larger meal."}
{"text":"Have lived in the area and am here visiting. There are a few other shawarma places in the immediate area but this place kills it. All the right toppings, spiced well, a good portion of chicken. Guys that work there are always nice. If your in the area skip another cruddy mess from Ali Babas and come here."}
{"text":"The wrap they sell over there is good but it's sooo sloppy you can't even eat it it jus falls apart worst pita land in Canada!"}
{"text":"Decent space , Very tasty chicken shawerma wrap and falafel wrap.
Will definitely come again"}
{"text":"Excellent chicken shawarma, Reasonable price, Although hit or miss service depending on who is working the counter"}
{"text":"Today was the last time I have purchased ANYTHING from here. The service is non-existent, the food literally tastes like regurgitated Taco Bell... Who in the world grills a pita IN the wrapping paper? The guy behind the counter tried charging me extra for normal toppings like olives. Stay away at all costs! BARF!"}
{"text":"Been coming to Pita Land for years. The chicken shawarma is the best I've had and the price is fair. Ingredients are fresh and chicken is cooked perfectly. The side items, pop and chips are a but over priced, and not worth the extra money for their portion size. 
The new location accepts debit cards now, unlike the old store which was cash only. The staff are great, and remember me all the time. 
If you frequent by Pita Land, ask for a VIP card; buy 9 Pitas and the 10th is free!"}
{"text":"Had a great beef kabob and salad plate, really good rice!!"}
{"text":"I usually grab lunch from here on the regular and we've catered from here for the office as well. First of all the people that work here are great and very friendly. They pretty much know my order now as well. I've tried the chicken shawarma, beef shawarma, The salads, the plates the potatoes and the Fallafel. Everything tastes awesome !"}
{"text":"I usually go into this location for a quick meal on my way to work for later. I always get the chicken shawarma plate because I want veges and the garlic potatoes. The food is alright for what it is. There are better places but it is close to where I live.

Today I ordered my meal in line after a woman who asked for a chicken plate. I said I would also like a chicken plate and was told to wait 5 minutes. I figured the wait was for the rice so I stepped to the side. I looked at my watch and realized I didn't have time to wait before I had to be at work. I told the owner I was going to leave because I didn't have time and to cancel my order. 

Turns out the lady before me ordered souvlaki chicken instead of the shawarma I thought she ordered. The man had already put the meat on the grill. I said I was sorry for making the mistake and that I didn't realize she ordered something else. The man (who I assume is the owner) became quite angry and aggressive with me, angrily telling me that he already put the food on the grill and that it would be wasted. I said I was sorry and that I come to the location often so I can pay for it another time. He yelled \"if you come here all the time you should know our menu\". I asked him how much he wanted for the wasted meat. He wanted to charge me the full menu price for just the meat which I would not be taking. 

I put 5 dollars on the counter and said Ill pay you for the meat in the order. He yelled at me \"I don't want your pity!!!\"

What pity?!!? I'm offering you more than enough money for the thing you just said will be wasted. He refused to take the $5 so I asked if he wanted it or not? He said no so I took my money, said I am not coming back and left.

Needless to say I will never be going back to this location. The owner is ridiculous."}
{"text":"Very generous amount of veggies in a pita! Open till very late. I was a happy customer and will be back."}
{"text":"I've been to two Pita Land locations in Vaughan and they were far superior in terms of food and service. It was slow here. They didn't even have any manager specials like the others. 

My biggest gripe is the potatoes...these ones have no flavour at all. The other places make them spicy and garnish with herbs."}
{"text":"Food and service here is fantastic! Really friendly guys that work here. They give baklava treats free of charge for first-timers.

I get the falafel pita and garlic potatoes. Yum."}
{"text":"Pita land!  The land of the pita!  This place is good!  I usually get a combo for 10$.   Chicken shawarma, garlic potatoes and a can of pop.  Usually get mine loaded with everything in it. Average price for downtown.  The chicken is nice and tender.  I'm usually hungry still after, but that's just me."}
{"text":"Food is okay but overpriced. Best dish I've had here is the falafel wrap. 

For a better wrap, try the Mrs. Greek across the intersection."}
{"text":"Just had the most horrible experience at this location. Was served by an extremely rude and unhygenic lady named Alma. I asked for a soup, she cleaned the dirt of her the corners of her mouth (not wearing gloves) then took my soup container and her thumb the one that just touched her mouth, was on the rim and the inner portion of the soup cup. I requested for her to pour me a new soup and pit on gloves. She started giving me attitude and telling me that she doesn't have to put gloves, and that it is not a big deal because I can serve the soup in another plate, and that her finger didn't touch the actual soup. At this point I said that I would like a refund and just want to leave. That if she doesn't understand what she did wrong I will get Ministry of health to educate her. By that time there was another customer inside, she said time that I have to wait for the refund as she will serve the new customer first. I said that I am an exisiting customer and she should provide me with a refund and not serve a new one. Thankfully, a man came out from the back to offer his help (clearly he had some customer service skills, unlike this lady). He said that he will serve the new customer for her to provide me with refund, she refused. So he helped me out by issuing refund. I am so grossed out, and offended as a customer. I will never set foot in this place again!! Do not recommend! If this is how she acts in front of consumers, I would hate to imagine how she handles food in their absence. BAD EXPERIENCE!!!!!"}
{"text":"Can I rate it lower ? Bad server - slow and messed up
Order. One guy working only . Food is so so . And it's like $10 . Plenty of other better spots in the area"}
{"text":"The food here is great. The ingredients are fresh and the servings are excellent. I'm a fan of their chicken shawarma and the garlic potatoes. The owners are great and you see this in the service and quality. I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"I've been here for years as their shwarma is decent. However in Jan 2017 they raised the prices by 10%, and just again in the new year Jan 2018 they raised it by 15%! A chicken shwarma plate now costs over $15! Absolutely ridiculous. I can get a bowl of ramen down the street at a sit down restaurant for $12. 

I'll take my business to Villa Madina, where their plates cost $10 (33% less!)."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Shawarma places in Toronto for many reasons. 

For one thing, they are reasonably priced at $6 a sandwich. That's a good deal to me, but it's probably not the cheapest Shawarma in town though. 

Their Shawarmas are also damn tasty. The meat is always hot and tender. The pickled radishes and vegetables are always fresh and crispy. They balance well, both in texture and temperature, with the soft-warm meat. I also love their white sauce (tahini?) they serve. It is both creamy and garlicky.

They are open until 5 am on weekends, so it's a dependable food option after a night of debauchery. Depending on when you go, it can get annoyingly packed and full of inebriated clientele. Even so, the service is usually friendly and fast. A staple late-night food option for me in Toronto."}
{"text":"Great place to come for a quick lunch or dinner. The staff is friendly, food is affordable and you can get in and out pretty quick if that's your goal. This place is almost cafeteria style, but the food tastes much fresher and better than normal cafeteria food. On the other hand, some of the main entrees aren't in holding pins.

I went big and tried several items, with the main being the chicken shawarma, which few could complain about. It was tasty and they give you a massive amount of food, including a huge pile of rice. I also ordered a small cup of lentil soup, and even though it seemed like it'd been in the holding pin all day was hot and satisfying. I ordered a small hummus too and the guy went in the back and made it from scratch. He was gone for five minutes and I thought he forgot about me. That's good stuff!

It's simple, if you like Middle Eastern food you can't go wrong here, particularly if you're in a hurry."}
{"text":"I loved this little joint. Not a place you hear about but it should be. I love middle eastern cuisine and these guys know how to make a DELICIOUS mouth watering shawarma. I had a tough time deciding what to order, it all looked so yummy. 

The garlic potatoes were BOMB. I was skeptical because of bad previous experiences but this place has mastered garlic potatoes, with a drizzle of tzatziki you're in heaven. Just avoid kissing anyone after. I also tried the rice. Super fluffy and light. Well done. 

The service was my favourite part :) the guys who were working were so cute and friendly and made sure I was taken care of, ensuring my happiness and my loyalty. TIP THEM. 

There's not a lot of seating is the only thing. But it's just a small fast food place on the corner so it's no big deal. It's like $10 for a meal here but it's so filling and satisfying, you can't go wrong.
ILL BE COMING BACK FOR YOU PITALAND"}
{"text":"Ordered chicken shawarma ($5.99?) and chicken skewer plate ($10.99) and three pieces of falalel ($1). The skewer was grilled fresh and shawarma made to order just usual. 

The chicken skewer plate was massive! Chicken was so delicious... omg! Big chunks and flavoured with different spices. Loved it. The shawarma was alright.. run of the mill but chicken was juicy. Next, the pieces of falalel were so dry! Oi. I love falalel..wish it was better. 

Service was good, grilling took 5 minutes and it was quick. Overall not bad! I would get the chicken skewer plate again. 

I woke up parched in the middle of the night..so I'm guessing the marinating sauce/spices were salty."}
{"text":"The price is very steep for what you are getting. I paid $10.30 for their shawarma wrap special which included a chicken shawarma wrap, a choice of a side and a pop/water. The Shawarma was average and was not grilled long enough. I ordered the falafels for my side dish and it came with 3 very small lukewarm falafels. There are several better Shawarma places nearby where you can get a larger portion and better quality for a cheaper price."}
{"text":"Portions are ok, shawarma was tasty enough, potatoes were cold but had nice flavour. And, why would you use Italian dressing on the salad accompanying a Mediterranean meal and charge extra for feta on a dinner plate.  Meal was just OK. 

Bowl option included feta but the soup was poured on potatoes and could not be on side, even in a limited portion.

Rice appeared to be plain white rice with no added spices or flavour.

Don't plan on returning unless for a PITA."}
{"text":"I regret stepping foot inside this establishment.
I went to order their chicken shawarma combo with fries and they wouldn't substitute fries so I said I'll get the garlic potatoes instead, they didn't have any potatoes so I got their samosa as  side. I wanted beef but they only had veggie. I also wanted a can of iced tea they didn't have that either or diet coke. I think this place needs to stock up"}
{"text":"I was giving my brother a lift to a recording studio on King east and we decided to grab a quick bite before his session. We were hoping to find some sushi but after walking a few blocks along King between Sherbourne and Jarvis and not finding much that was open, we settled on Pita Land somewhat disappointedly. As soon as we took the first bite of our chicken shawarma pitas, we were pleasantly surprised. The chicken meat was extremely juicy, tender and flavourful. The hot sauce and garlic mayo were also delicious. We ended up ordering a third pita and splitting it. The guy was even kind enough to saw our pita in half with his awesome electric shwarma carving knife. It looks like they have 7 locations around Toronto so if you're looking for a quick bite and you happen to be near one of them, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I went in here on a random whim the other day, & when I had trouble deciding what to order, one of the employees gave me a thorough explanation of the entire menu. I ordered a chicken souvlaki wrap with lettuce & hummus, & it was one of the best things I've ever eaten. I went back today for another one. Yummmm."}
{"text":"I eat there at least twice a week and only get the gyro wrap. I get extra hummus, garlic and tzatziki sauce. Amazing... But it depends who makes it! Try to get the females, it makes the difference and I honestly don't know why. My boyfriend always gets the chicken plate."}
{"text":"I always enjoy trying new Shawarmas and seeing how they stack up against the greats.  I came across Pita Land and didn't expect too much but gave it a try.  Wow!  Their chicken shawarma was the most delicious and juicy chicken I have ever tried.  Somehow they pack the chicken with the best most mouth watering flavor I've had.  I used to swear by Lazeez but after trying Pita Land there is a new clear favorite.  10/10.  Would recommend  any shawarma enthusiast try one out.  A few tasty extras that they offer that are out of the norm are Jalapeños which can bring a unique flavor to the wrap.  The only area I would like them to improve upon is mixing the ingredients in tge wrap more."}
{"text":"Don't recommend this place, the lady offered a promotion that if buying a chicken shawarma plate , it will come with any free drink. I saw a bottle of green tea I wanted therefore I got it. 

When paying, the cashier said it only applies to CAN drinks, and bottles were upgrade of $1 more. Very misleading

The chicken was dry and the potato was old and sandy

Please see pictures."}
{"text":"I wouldn't call it a great place for Shawarma just because of how much choice there is in Toronto in that area.  But definitely edible and very affordable."}
{"text":"I go to Pita Land religiously at the Don Mills location but this one seemed closer to my home. I definitely regretted this decision.

I ordered my usual chicken shawarma to go and it was such a disgusting, saucy mess that I couldn't even take a bite without a glob of sauce dropping.  

I thought I would give it a second chance since my previous visit, my shawarma was made by a trainee. I requested for less sauce this time but it was exactly the same: a big mess. The paper bag was soaked in sauce by the time I had brought it home and I had to throw it out as it had dripped everywhere. I've learned my lesson and won't be returning to this location."}
{"text":"They never put enough meat in their Shawarmas!!! Way to cheap! I have regretted going there every time in the hopes that it will be better this time around, but to my disappointment they just sprinkle up a couple of pieces(sometimes even burnt and charred !) I have been to other Pitaland locations and there is a marked difference in the meat fillings. The one at VP and consumers absolutely rocks!
Not worth your money coming to this location."}
{"text":"Edited cause it's gotten worse over the years. They're messy and soggy now - what happened!"}
{"text":"I came here with some friends and was really impressed. My friends and I ordered a plates of food instead of the pita dishes. More or less, the plate dishes are served on a plate and are missing the pita portion of the meal.

I was really impressed that this fast food joint could accommodate my gluten free diet. I chose the chicken plate and loaded it with lots of vegetables, salad, and hummus.

The food tasted delicious!  I was a little surprised that my dish cost about $17 when I reached the cash register. For a fast food place the price is a little high but it did taste fantastic!

Pita Land also provides guests with a combo option, which can include a soup, potatoes or chips and a drink. I didn't participate in this since I wasn't craving soup, couldn't eat the potatoes and really don't like potato chips. 

Allover, I would return here for a quick lunch if I was in the area."}
{"text":"Great veggie platter. I love the turnips. I love the green falafel and vegetarian kebebah. The people are nice."}
{"text":"This pitaland place use to be my go to spot until I moved. This place is great because it opens late and service is quick and portions are huge. I always get their chicken schwar ma plate and it definately satisfy my cravings. The portion sizes were enough to feed two people if you aren't that hungry. However, knowing how much I can eat, a plate is often what I get along with their mini side items such as samosas. Price is reasonable considering the amount of rice and chicken they give. Definately one of my go to places if you want to have a feast late at night."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Pita Land for lunch this week. 
We decided on Chicken Shawarmas.

They weren't bad as you could certainly taste that the meat and the veggies were really fresh, but even though I got some sauces to spice things up I felt everything tasted a bit bland.

The staff is really nice.
It's cash only. But they have an ATM in the store."}
{"text":"Everyone raves about this place so I thought I'd try it. I ordered the chicken shawarma plate which was 11$ ish on the menu. I found they were stingy on basically everything... I got two potatoes with my meal and the whole thing was rice and salad with a few pickles, onions, peppers etc. when I got to the cash to pay it was $15 because some toppings aren't included in the plate? Extremely disappointing. I've had cheaper shawarma plates in the past and gotten way more food. Don't get me wrong the food was tasty... Just not 15$ for lunch tasty. I will be seeking out a different place for shawarma next time."}
{"text":"One of the best shawarma place at west side. I had a chicken shawarma, chicken is really flavorful on itself.  I would highly recommend it.  
Will definitely go back again"}
{"text":"Don't go here if you're not Canadian.  They don't take credit cards and failed to post any signs on their front door or website. We are tourists and tried using our debit card but it would not accept. You don't pay until after you ordered your food, so that's when you find out that it's cash only.  Finally paid with US dollars and they cheated us. The took an extra $10 and did not honor the exchange rate. When we approached the manager and told them they owed us some Canadian dollars, he refused. He said \"This isn't the US!\"  Told him that he was wrong and he should inform customers before taking an order. Also, he should post this on his door and website. He shrugged it off and didn't care. Unfortunately our kids had to witness someone cheating us out of money in Canada- supposed to be a friendly place!"}
{"text":"There's something about eating healthy that is more than just a slam against the fast-food
industry.

When you bite into a delicious Pita Land Shwarma not only are you eating healthy, but you feel at one with the the Pita - it's a Zen experience ;)

I keep it simple. - basic chicken Schwarma, hummus spread , lettuce , tomato, lettuce and \"tabuli \" topped width a little hot sauce ... mind and matter are one ...

Namaste ;-)"}
{"text":"Pretty decent, 
I go to a lot of shawarma places and this one is alright. 
I prefer Ghazale in the village, but this place totally beats the garbagey wrap restaurants around Ryerson."}
{"text":"This used to be my favourite gyro spot. The flavour was great, the servings were generous and the prices were reasonable. 

However, now that all pita lands have been standardized, this place went from a 4.5/5 to a 2/5. The prices increased while the servings got much smaller. In addition, a bunch of the free toppings became premium toppings which you have to pay extra for.

I noticed a difference in the taste too. I think the taste has gotten much more bland compared to before.

Standardization is not always a good thing!"}
{"text":"The food is good, but the employee who served my boyfriend and I was unbelievably rude.

My boyfriend told the employee that he really enjoyed the food at the restaurant and recommended it to his friends. The employee in turn began making insulting comments toward us, telling us that the food wasn't very good, and calling my boyfriend's compliment \"sneaky\" and \"backhanded\". 

Overall, the food is really delicious but unfortunately due to the rudeness of the employee, we will not be visiting the restaurant again."}
{"text":"I ordered this. I was told it was being cooked. They tell me 30 minutes later that they've decided to cancel our order. Via Uber Eats"}
{"text":"Other Pita land locations are 100x better than this one. The other locations serve generous servings of authentic arab shawarma as opposed to this cheap location. Being cheap is the absolute worse thing a restaurant can be, and this is a prime example of CHEAP!"}
{"text":"This has to be my go to spot for a shawarma plate. I have tried other places, but I always come back to this one. I don't know what it is about there food, but it always is better than there competitors. Since I don't really like the salad, the girls there always throw in extra potatoes as well as more tazzeki sauce. The rice and chicken always taste fresh. Would recommend this all :)"}
{"text":"Pita Land! This chain is all over the city. When I was going to high school in Scarborough there was one I'd stop by on my way home , and when I saw this one near where I work I just had to go in!

I ordered my usual chicken shawarma wrap and was not disappointed. The ingredients and meat blended  well together along with the sauces. The wrap was nicely put together and toasted [I hate it when a shawarma falls apart :( ] . On top of that the inside was beyond clean washrooms included, everything was well organized and sorted. I will definitely be stopping by many more times :) ."}
{"text":"I came in here a couple of times the food is always cold and they never cut fresh chicken they always give me some leftovers on the grill :/"}
{"text":"Delicious with fresh ingredients. Clean packaging. Everything was great. Delivers through \"skip the dishes\" platform"}
{"text":"Great Shawarmas, the place is clean and food is great. Never has failed me for a quick bite in between classes."}
{"text":"I ordered Pita Land through UberEats (my new favourite thing!) awhile ago and ordered their plates instead of their wraps. UberEats came pretty efficiently with our meals and Pita Land did not get any of our orders wrong as well. They also provided condiments and utensils as per my request via UberEats. Pita Land also gave extra sauces in containers which were really nice of them.

Chicken Souvlaki Plate that was customised with potatoes, garlic sauce, Greek dressing, lettuce and tzatziki sauce. I like the tenderness of the chicken souvlaki, would probably try that next time when I order from Pita Land.
 
Chargrill BBQ Chicken Kebab Plate customised with potatoes, lettuce, garlic and tzatziki sauce. I wasn't a fan of the BBQ meat, it tasted really dry and was hard to eat. Maybe if there was more sauce added to this plate, the meat wouldn't have been as dry-tasting.

Chicken Shawarma Plate that came with garlic sauce, hot peppers, hot sauce, lettuce, onion, turnips, tzatziki with extra turnips, lettuce and onions. I love the turnips that come from Middle Eastern restaurants so I asked for extra and they provided! Which makes me a happy customer. The sauce had all paired up beautifully with my meal, especially I had mixed it all together.

I realised after opening my box was that my meat was all shredded up because it slipped my mind that 'shawarma' usually comes in shredded. Personally, it was hard to eat since it was in smaller pieces but I still enjoyed it.

Each of our plates also came with a side of pita/naan and hummus which definitely helps fill you up and you can also stuff your food items into the wrap!

After trying out the Chicken Shawarma Plate, I realised that I was more of a Shawarma Wrap girl. I didn't like my meal deconstructed and find it hard to eat everything. The meal itself was still good but just didn't work out for me - will definitely stick to wraps next time!"}
{"text":"A regular lunch-time stop for me. I'm always in and out quickly, no matter how many people are in line. Staff are courteous and quick. The tomatoes and lettuce typically spoil quickly when stored in this fashion, which I have experienced at Subway and other restaurants, but their ingredients are always fresh. For just 10 dollars, you can get quite the healthy and filling meal!"}
{"text":"if you're craving a fast, tasty lunch....go to pita land! I always get the chicken shwarma and i'm never disappointed. Everything is super fresh. The location is just south of don mills and Eglinton. Very clean, fast service and delicious food....can't get any better than that!"}
{"text":"Shite, 12 bucks for a salad with some dried up shawarma meat..no thanks"}
{"text":"I'm a fan of Pita Land. The food is fresh and the service is great. I will say however the portions sizes are not very constant and it is dependent on who is working. Some may give you more rice and some may give you less. I have noticed that the location on Langstaff gives better portions and more potatoes with their plates."}
{"text":"Eat here all the time, best shawarma around. The prices have gone up recently though. Staff is friendly."}
{"text":"Food here could be better. The meat is anything but fresh 
Needs a lot of work

{"text":"Open Super Late

Food was decent for what it is (hangover food)

Deceptively big place, with big seating area

not too shabby,

lots of weirdo's around at 3am though"}
{"text":"The management has made some big changes. This place is great. It's extremely clean, great price, giant portions and very friendly. You defiantly can appreciate that the new owner has pride in his business. I love coming here."}
{"text":"what is wrong with all these new shawarma places? their shawarmas don't even taste like shawarma. these small little franchise restaurants are ruining the beautiful middle-eastern food.

under $10 you get a combo but the there is no taste. i had shwarma sandwich and side of potatoes which were alright. their sauces were tasteless and quantity is just alright.

the owner/chef seems very friendly, greets all the customers as they open the door. he solely takes care of both the kitchen and cash (sometimes his wife comes in to help him out).

i don't think i will return here again.

******moving down from 2 to 1 star***** they do NOT accept the credit card and this is year 2015 where apparently someone from USA went up to the moon."}
{"text":"I decided check out this place out of curiosity. I ordered a falafel plate. The falafel tasted like you'd expect from a place like this, kind of a texture and flavour similar to cardboard. The service was ok, I didn't stay to eat. I don't think I'm gonna go back."}
{"text":"I'm happy here! I get the best tasting chicken shawarma wrap I know here. The ingredients are always high quality, and it is reflected in flavour. My latest trip broke a record in order speed; even with selecting my custom toppings, assembly and pressing, it must have been in my hand in 45 seconds! By the way, this is how I top this wrap: tzatziki (little), hummus (little), feta, lettuce, tomato and pickles.

Inb summary, the consistency, quality, and speed are all top notch with the operators here."}
{"text":"Shawarma places seem to be quite popular these days with on opening almost on every corner.  The competition is fierce so they all have to try to stand out from one another.  Some do and some don't.  Pita Land to me stands out just a bit more than a few others I have tried.  When ordering the shawarma plate it comes with your choice of 2 types of rice, the chicken, garlic potatoes, and a very small amout of salad with what ever toppings you like.  The lentil and cinnamon rice combined with the chicken, garlic sauce and hot sauce was incredible.  The garlic potatoes to me were outstanding.  Totally different from what I have ever tried.  The salad was just typical salad but very tiny.  I have been there twice already and i'm starting to notice that some of the workers are more stingy than the others so just keep a look out that they don't cut your portion.  Pita Land I will be back."}
{"text":"Went to dine at the Harvey's just down the street, saw this place, decided to check it out. Ordered a chicken shawarma, the lady who made it was very friendly, and the food was delicious, outstanding. The washrooms, on the other hand, left alot to be desired.  Yes, I would recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"It's clean, service is okay but the shawrma is nothing special.  It's not bad but within a 10 minute walk, you have Salad House (huge portions) or Falafel House (cheaper).  

However, for a quick bite, it'll do the job however I think the purple radish wasn't super fresh as I saw it was getting slightly dark.

Verdict: Meh.  Average at best."}
{"text":"I discovered this place Summer '14 and I've been going every single week since. The Beef Gyro drew me in, the Chicken Shawarma kept me in ecstasy, and the Waziri Plate sealed the deal. I've tried the rest and this place simply is the best. The prices are a bit high, but you get what you pay for. Do yourself a favour and get a Chicken Shawarma. You'll thank me when your feet finally touch the ground again."}
{"text":"Went in around 10 pm on a Tuesday night and there were about 4 people waiting, a good sign. The staff were very friendly, we ordered two falafel wraps and some samosas. The falafel were delicious and the samosas were good too, the pitas were especially well wrapped which anyone who gets a lot of shawarma will appreciate! Easy to eat from the wrapper and not messy. Would defintly visit again:)"}
{"text":"Disappointed 

Not much choice on the menu, place wasn't busy considering it's a Saturday night..... Should have gave me alarm bells as the surrounding businesses were all mobbed, when I say it wasn't busy..... The guy serving was on his laptop at a table as NO ONE was in 

The flavours were good however the tomatoes on display looks old and wrinkly 

Chicken was a little dry and chewy like it had been cooked several times and reheated"}
{"text":"Ambiance: pretty chill, clean, tidy

I had a salad and it made me feel sick.
Tasted pretty decent at first, but it was really greasy
Don't know if its the minced beef they put on it or if it was their greek dressing... probably a combo of both

MEAT WAS NOT COOKED PROPERLY. 
The minced beef they topped my salad with had pink in the middle and burnt on the outside. (how do you f up minced beef?) 

but anyways. I won't be going back."}
{"text":"I was here at 12:30am and the night crew was rude and all they had was the chicken shawarma and my shawarma was filled with more lettuce than chicken not worth it for the price !"}
{"text":"This location is in the heart of Flemo' - when I work in Scarborough, I make an excuse to have lunch here. I have been here a few times because of the parking (in a plaza), the daily deals, and the chicken shawarma. The latter isn't too greasy and the guys who work here STUFF the pita with veggies so you get bang for your buck. For a reasonable and quick lunch, try Pita Land on Don Mills.

Good for: lunch, late night eats"}
{"text":"Delivery at 2 am on a friday was great lol

I tired the beef which tasted more like gyro but the sides were good and the sauce was not bad either

I will try out the chicken the next late night weekend I am too lazy to drive and feel like a full meal lol

Update: after numerous bad ubereats experiences I have decided to stop using eats and eating anything from any pits land.

It's good late night fair but not competitive during regular business hours if you are mobile."}
{"text":"Was okay.

Nice if on health tip and don't have time to cook.

Will try some other things one day."}
{"text":"Pita land is delicious and fresh! I got a beef shawarma and it was the best one I have ever had. So fresh and full of bold flavors. Garlic sauce is a must!"}
{"text":"Excellent shawarma. Probably one of the best places in the city. The service is usually prompt, the food is good, and the prices are reasonable. Serving sizes for the plates are absurdly big (be warned).

There's not much else to say. Go here for shawarma if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Hard workers, decent prices, enjoyable shawarma wraps!"}
{"text":"They don't have beef shawarma! How can you be a shawarma place if you only have chicken and gyro?

Taste-wise, it's so-so. Nothing great.

I think they try to rip you off by asking what toppings you want without disclosing that most are extras. You'll only find out when they hand you the bill. I don't mind paying for what I ask for but I also want full disclosure.

Never coming back. There are better shawarma places in Durham."}
{"text":"I just bought two shawarmas from here it was sooooooooo freakin bad . 

I couldn't even finish the shawarma the meat smelled soooo bad and it also tasted sooo bad, the best part was I been hungry all freakin day and then I went to buy food. 

And everyone knows that saying when your hungry, everything taste good. Even under this, metaphorical law this shawarma still didn't taste good, imagine how it would taste if I bought it when I wasn't that hungry (double vomit ). 
  

Don't go here and waste your money as I did buy something else cuz no matter how much you enjoy shawarma this place is not even worth.

( beef)"}
{"text":"I have only tried their chicken Soulvaki and Falafel.. One of the best soulvaki i have eaten.. Cooked to perfect.. Very tender and has a lot of flavor to it"}
{"text":"That was a pretty good shawarma!
The garlic potatoes weren't bad either.

So far this one of the better places to grab a lunch for under $10 after tax that I've found in the area. Give it a try!"}
{"text":"Not great at all!  Guy serving seemed like he hated his job and was annoyed serving me.  Chicken shawarma was very mediocre and had a sweet taste I usually don't experience.  Don't bother!"}
{"text":"Get the Chicken Shawarma plate, thank me later! Only problem is that it's a little too expensive but nevertheless, I keep coming back!"}
{"text":"I agree with Tammy - the food is nice with interesting pickled radish and cabbage salad that they add into shawarmas. Some servers tend to be a little economical, so depending on how hungry you are one shawarma may not be enough. Definitely good value for the money, and the place I keep defaulting to when I'm in the hood."}
{"text":"Walked into this location on my way from work, and was taken aback by such a wonderful experience. You usually don't expect these stop-and-go joints to deliver good customer service, but what I received was incredible. As soon as I walked in, I was greeted by Nadia and she made sure to engage in conversation with me as she made my platter. As always, the food was excellent and I definitely recommend it to everyone. I'll be coming back for sure."}
{"text":"So my friend and I were deciding on a quick place to eat and we decided to come here. I gotta say it was a great decision.
We got a falafel wrap and a beef kebab. 
Falafel wrap was pretty good, they packed it pretty nicely and the taste of the meat was pretty good. The only thing was the wrapping paper got stuck to the pita, kinda meh for me .
But then came the beef kebab plate. Oh boy... They had the meat pre prepared and when we asked for it they put it on the grill.
On the plate with the rice and the veggies this was such a blessed meal 11/10. Would definitely recommend people coming here for a quick bite. 
The price isn't too bad either so definitely a to go place. 
The service was really good too!"}
{"text":"Don't waste your time. I got a falafel shawarma and they put it all together in 5 minutes. They microwaved the falafel, barely gave me any toppings and put that all in a pita that fell apart when they wrapped it. Instead of making me a new one, he just wrapped it in paper and pretended it never happened."}
{"text":"This place is disgusting. The lentil soup they served was watered down, tasted different from other locations. They serve food from trays taken from top of garbage can, without cleaning...the Indian girl who served me didn't see anything wrong with that...what is it with these people?   Oh btw, I saw a rat in the patio area...need I say more. Totally disgusting experience."}
{"text":"The customer service was great and so was the food!! Definitely would come back another time"}
{"text":"My primary reason for visiting this establishment was to try a squire of chicken because its low carb friendly. While I agree that the chicken was one of the best I have ever had. The price for a squire of chicken is astronomical compared to other establishments that are near by. For that reason, I will have to make this my first and last experience at Pita Land. I can't justify spending $4 on a squire of chicken when their competition is offering the same at $2.75."}
{"text":"Make sure to check out Pita Land's chicken shwarma plate!

It's legit."}
{"text":"I dont understand why you would choose to visit this poor quality, over-priced chain over some of the fantastic independently owned shawarma/pita places in the area. I know the only reason i did was becaise its open late, but now i know to never go again. Small portions, expensive menu (expensive for what youre getting vs what you can get elsewheere"}
{"text":"I've been here a handful of times and have never been disappointed! The service is great, the food is fresh and the topping selection is plentiful. Had the special of the day today - chicken shawarma - DELICIOUS. Brought my bf with me this time and he was definitely impressed!"}
{"text":"Wow wtf was this. I ordered a shawrma wrap \"large\" it was 15$$ and it only had legit 5 pieces of shawrma chicken in it?!?!  Wtf did I pay for a pita and lettuce. Very not impressed"}
{"text":"Great tasting food. However the price hike isn't the greatest. I'd rather get a nice meal elsewhere for $15/pita. I'll stick to Lazeez."}
{"text":"My visits to pita land specifically this location are usually very good experiences I really like the food it's fresh. The service is really good. 4 stars 

From a business perspective I think you guys should stay open a little bit later to keep up with the 24 hours good life that's right beside you. subway still eating up the late-night business"}
{"text":"I came here on a quiet Tuesday night and the gentleman serving my boyfriend and I was the sweetest person ever! He was super friendly and nice and threw in two small soups for us. He made our experience enjoyable. We need more people like him the word :) thanks so much for the friendly service. FOOD IS THE BOMB TOO. :D"}
{"text":"I'm amazed that this place is a chain.  We hit the Rexdale and Martin Grove location after picking up our son Christmas Eve from Pearson and not much was open at all.  But Pita Land was and the Falafel was great.  It hit the stop especially for my son who was very hungry after a long fly from SFO."}
{"text":"The Pita Land is under new ownership and it shows. I had given this place a few chances while it was under previous management and everything felt cheap and there was never enough food for a big guy like me. 

After meeting the new owner I had told him about my previous experiences and he compeletely changed my mind about this place. The food was very good and the price was very cheap for the massive amount of food that I got. 

I would recommend this place to everyone!"}
{"text":"The chicken shawarma plate is a must-try. It comes with rice, salad, and potatoes (although you could skip the salad and get more potatoes if you're super hungry). It's topped with a generous portion of chicken then covered with tzatziki and hot sauce (optional).

Also, they close pretty late so it's perfect for when those late night cravings hit."}
{"text":"great tasting food, fast and friendly service, and reasonably priced. very flavourful sauces as well. definitely one of my favourite places to get shawarma in the city!"}
{"text":"It's not always easy finding a great place to eat late at night that's also conveniently located close by...UNLESS you end up walking by the glorious Pita Land. I've walked by this place hundreds of times in the past and never thought much of it. It was around 11:45PM on Saturday night and I was feeling the hunger after attending a show at the Phoenix Theater. Everything seemed to be closed (I did not want Pizza Pizza) and then I stumbled across a very open and full Pita Land. The gentleman working were super friendly, super quick, and made some amazing beef shawarma wraps that not only filled me up, but left me laying in a pool of drool craving a couple more of them. The beef shawarma wrap was absolutely delicious, filled with a ton of flavour, and fully customizable. I don't eat nearly as many greens as I should but I was able to add whatever I did like along with hummus, some spicy sauce (no idea what it was or what it's called), some cucumbers, onions, and corn.  

This place was a total time and stomach saver Saturday night and it definitely will be on my list of places to return to in the future. I highly recommend Pita Land to anyone who likes shawarma, or good food in general, definitely worth the trip here."}
{"text":"Went in there for lunch yesterday and we'll what can I say ? The staff was nice but the food was bad. The meat was dry and tasteless. 
They charge an extra 25 cents for corn, cilantro and other stuff."}
{"text":"This place is just okay I got to say.  It will not be the best shwarma you've ever had nor the worst.  

SERVICE
The service at this place is pretty slow... it usually takes me about 15 minutes to do takeout.  Which isn't long I guess...but longer than I want to wait for fast food.

FOOD
The beef is not the type of beef swharma that most people are used to.  It's kind of this ground, homemade and put together style of beef.  It's okay... the chicken swharma is really good though! I appreciate how they cut the meat and grill it for you! 

The potatoes are also pretty good! Often times, I see people go up and order just more potatoes.  The rice is okay... they literally make it in advance and pop it into the microwave.

PRICE
For what you get it's just okay... I think it's about $11.99 for a plate now and you have to buy the pita bread.  There are definitely better spots but unfortunately in the East end the options for swharma are limited.

QUANTITY
As other people have mentioned the quantity you get has decreased.  They are kind of stingy with the rice, potatoes and sides.  The meat is hit or miss though...some days you get a lot some days you get less.

Would I visit again? Yes... but it's more of a convenience thing.  I wouldn't go out of my way for it."}
{"text":"It was awful but I ate it all because I was starving and is the only reason why I finished my chicken shawarma with extra disgusting \"garlic sauce\" that tasted like oregano. It was such a let-down and did not deliver the taste of garlic which is the true hallmark of any shawarma, after the meat. The meat was also lacking, it was boney mush garbage when it wasn't super dried-out and crunchy (which it's also not supposed to be). The girl ignored us for a couple minutes upon arrival while she scraped the grill that was already clean and seemed very pointless, and this was maddening as we were standing there waiting and waiting and waiting and starving. Bad business training plus rude. I got the feeling that mgmt made a big deal about a clean grill. She was a nice kid though. I don't want to put them out of business as there's not many QSR's at Bloor/Sherbourne so I guess I should have gone to Timmies next door instead. You eat to feel better, not worse which is how I came away from this establishment and will be forever haunted for not saying serve the customer, clean the grill afterward."}
{"text":"super busy.. saturday evening..
food is so good. prices are normal. 
everything was delicious and service eas quick and delicious."}
{"text":"review based soley on chicken shwarma wraps.
many toppings and sauces to choose from. taste fresh and juicy. price wasnt too bad.. $20 for 2 wraps and a water bottle.

great service. clean sit down area. really enjoyed the wrap."}
{"text":"Open later than the nearby shwarma places so I go here when the better places around have closed - ie donair kebab house on yonge/gerrard by the big slice.

I suspect the restaurant was better before changing names from my experiences with the restaurant and what the other reviews suggest. Service was \"ok\" as was the food. I'll be back but the other places have to be closed first."}
{"text":"I don't know why I keep coming here and expect things to change. It always the same thing, not a lot of food for a lot more than you should pay. 

At some point, Pita Land was one of the best lunch values i could find for middle Eastern food for lunch. Well, Mediterranean at least. I was always a fan of getting Gyros salad which mixed with all the toppings was always a steal at around $6.

Now? It's the same as many other places, a ton of lettuce and then they put away the tongs and take out the tweezers to pinch and add minuscule amounts of toppings for everything not called lettuce. Barely any actual gyros and they look to charge you for every add on including peppers, mushrooms, hummus, etc. 

That same salad I used to get is now about $11 for the same amount of food. 

Don't get me wrong still tastes fine, still not bad at all. I'd definitely want to eat more of it. Just not at that price."}
{"text":"The chicken shawarma was not good. The meat was but something about the sauces was just off. The falafels were really good but pretty small! I never ordered from Pita Land and wanted to try it out but regretted it once I tasted the shawarma. If i ever crave just falafel I may order from here but shawarma no. Seriously regretting my decision of ordering from here.. money down the drain."}
{"text":"Quality food. Its fresh and the place is open till 3am which is very convenient. They give a lot of hummus and garlic sauce which i love lol"}
{"text":"I mostly come here for the garlic potatoes. Food is similar to what you'd find anywhere else. It is never too busy when I drop in."}
{"text":"This place is always consistently good. It never fails to disappoint me and the quality is always fresh and delicious especially the late nigh cravings. ugh I love you pita land!"}
{"text":"Served me raw, cold, falafels.  Very small serving too, for the price.

I came in at 9 pm, they had run out of a few snack items I was interested in even though their closing time is 12 am.

I ordered a falafel.  The man behind the counter fried the falafel, for what seemed like under a minute.  There wasn't much falalel in there either.

In any case, he prepared it very quickly, and kept asking if I wanted more sauces and more toppings.  I didn't realize it, but he was looking to charge extra for the additional toppings.  I ended up just paying for one extra, that I didn't realize cost extra.

I didn't say anything, I politely paid and went to my car to eat.  A minute later, the man walked out the door, it was the end of his shift.

I bit into the cold vegetables, which is fine, because they're vegetables.

Suddenly, I bit into very cold, and very raw, falafel.  They were not fried at all!"}
{"text":"Formerly La Zeez, Pita Land offers the best chicken shawarma in the area. Seriously.

At $6, it's a bit pricier than some competitors, but this nets you a better tasting, and more satisfying wrap. Not much else to say. Get everything on it, including the hot sauce and \"special\" sauce.

If you're looking for more, a side of garlic potatoes is highly recommended. Asking for extra hot sauce on this shows you mean business.

If you don't want a pita, the dinner plate is always available. If you're a cheap bastard, instead of getting rice & potatoes (as they'll offer), just get potatoes and cook off some rice at home. Aw yeah."}
{"text":"Im not that big on middle eastern food.  However this is the best Ive had.

The portions are humungous. I like this place and it has a cool patio.   My experience was supreme at the Gerrard street location.   They deserve a 5 

However, the bloor street location had a very rude staff that deserves a 1 star. 

So when I average both out - they get a 3 from me."}
{"text":"The food is very good and the employees are very helpful, I eat here a lot as it is one of the few places in the mall that offers hot fresh food. I usually get the chicken wrap, the grape leaves are a nice side order."}
{"text":"I was getting an oil change next door and I had two hours to kill. This was also the day that I didn't have time to make lunch and the cafeteria at work was closed.

Doner/schwarma is one of my favorite foods so I was pleasantly surprised to find this place next door. For $6, I got a huge doner that was stuffed with vegetables and chicken. The staff all had warm smiles and were very friendly.

The exterior is, to put it bluntly, not so nice; however, I would like to come here again! :)"}
{"text":"The place is really small, just to take to go. They don't have tables to sit.
But the food is really good, was the best experience eating shawarma. The chicken is amazing, I don't know what is different on it, but taste so good.
The price is similar to others place. And the service is fast with nice workers.
I recommend it hardly"}
{"text":"A great Shwarma place!!

Fantastic garlic potatoes

Seasoned rice

And the chicken is moist and tasteful

Lots of toppings

Including pickled turnips and pickles which most places don't have

Maybe the carbs are clouding my judgment


But I'm not even half done and I had to write my review !!

Huge serving for 13$ 

Defiantly will be back"}
{"text":"Disappointed... smaller portions than other locations, and they burnt my kebabs. There charcoal grill was broken which they didn't tell me ... they cooked my kebabs over the gas stove fire. 

Even the salad amount was very small. The only thing they give a lot of is sauce. It was drowning

Flavour was ok. I mean it's beside my house so I'll probably come back but much better portions at other pita places in the area

Other pita lands give u massive amounts of food
This one gives u very little"}
{"text":"delicious pita! beautiful interior! the staff is not very friendly, but I will do a discount on a hot day! Sure come back for delicious chicken pita"}
{"text":"Poor value for money! $14 for a shawarma plate? Ridiculous!

Many other options in the area where you get much better food for less. 

Don't bother!"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place! Admittedly I have only had the lamb shawarma but it is so great I don't end up getting anything else. They are decently priced and give large servings with a great staff on hand. The baklava may not be made in-house but it is sticky and crispy, just the way I like it. Yum."}
{"text":"Best shawarma in maple! So good and always fresh. Not too expensive and they have the best sauces I've ever tried!"}
{"text":"Very good shawarma! I'm not crazy about the potatoes they give you, but they're not bad. This place does get busy at times and sometimes there is only 1 worker so be prepared to wait a bit!"}
{"text":"I ate here after my dinner elsewhere was completely gross. I am so happy I did! The chicken shawarma was delicious! It's affordable, fast and easy."}
{"text":"Meh. The shawarma was tasteless. I couldn't even taste the hummus or garlic sauce, too skimpy with it. On a bonus note, the dude at the counter was super nice."}
{"text":"I frequent this place quite often because it's nearby and the food is pretty tasty. I usually have the chicken pita. It's good for a quick meal. Excellent garlic potatoes!"}
{"text":"I love the chicken shwarma wrap & when I'm feeling less carbish, I just ask them to make it into a salad. Either way, it's damn good. The service is pretty alright. One time I ordered take out and when I arrived, they had forgotten to make it. Another time I ordered take out and they told me 'no' because it gets saugy. Both times it took less than 5 minutes to make so the wait wasn't unbearable during lunch hour. You can take that however you wish, positive or negative. Either way, I'll still return for more chicken shwarma!"}
{"text":"They charged me $18 for a double chicken plate with half the rice. This place is the worst ever, the chicken had way to much oil. Please don't eat here,  never going back."}
{"text":"The chicken gyro was good. The prices are okey. I recommend. Was a little hot inside the restaurant."}
{"text":"On this day, my boyfriend wanted something simple and fast for lunch.

Seeing that it looked like the owners of this place was also the owners of Extreme Taste next door, we thought we'd give it a try.  

Just like Extreme Taste, this place is reasonably priced at $5 for a shawarma and soda.  The service was great, the food was okay, but I'm giving it 3 stars because the meat was hard."}
{"text":"I think there are new owners ...portions are much smaller than what it used to be last year when I was able to share a box between 2 people . server was not the happiest either."}
{"text":"I went with my friend and her children. The food was awful. Both my friend and I have eaten there before and it was average but today, we both felt sick afterwards (mildly nauseated). I don't know if the management has changed? I had the chicken shawarma pita and 2 shawarma plates + an orange juice and the total came to $34. That is expensive for food that did not taste good and made us feel unwell for a few hours."}
{"text":"Pita Land continues my unbroken tradition of \"acceptable sustenance\" in the greater Toronto area. I picked it because they delivered to my hotel.

Ordered - chicken schwarma. It was ok - a decent portion served on a lot of (flavorless) rice with some salad and about one tablespoon of hummus. They included hot sauce which helped. It wasn't terrible but wasn't anything great either.

Delivery - arrived ahead of promised time which is always nice. If you don't meet the delivery min ($25 I think), they charge you $10 for delivery. 

Overall - it was food. They delivered it. That's about all I can say."}
{"text":"Always have been a fan of shawarma!! You get your protein,veggies and hot sauce/hot peppers for the metabolism aiding benefits all in one orgasmic gulp.  

Shawarma plate is perfect if you don't feel for a sandwich-like meal. Big enough portions as you get it with their delicious moist rice and all the sides if you wish.
Only downside is that bread is not included with the meal like other shawarma joints. Garlic sauce is mild and doesn't have the 'date blinding ' breath factor. 

Clean resto if you wish to dine in and staff are great when taking down your topping suggestions, with 'extra this' and 'extra that' without the unnecessary attitude considering the area. Flemo park used to scare non locals, urban legend or not, my younger days did not include the risk of getting jumped so avoiding the area altogether seemed like the wiser thing to do back then.

This place has evolved more though with the plaza getting a much needed upgrade. Newer restaurants popping through which I'm sure get their business from the Ontario science centre and neighboring offices.

Great alternative to Subway and Tim hortons right next door."}
{"text":"Maybe I was just crazy hungry when I came in, was actually heading to the Tim Horton's next door when I noticed the sign and came here instead. 

The service was quick, friendly enough considering it is a fast food joint, and the food is fresh. Had the chicken shawarma sandwich. The chicken was seasoned nicely and the vegetables were crunchy. I was really happy I found this place since I didn't check it out on Yelp first and didn't read the other reviews until after the fact. 

The prices are reasonable and well within that of the competition. I'll definitely be back for a follow up."}
{"text":"I have to say, after coming back from Korea I figured that Toronto would be able to get their pitas right. You can only imagine how excited I was to move just down the street from a pita place!

Turns out it's not so hot. If I'm there I either get unfriendly service or indifferent service. It's not really the most difficult food service job in the world, so skipping on the annoyed attitude or putting on a smile shouldn't be that difficult.

The food itself is fairly bland. My pita was stale but I can forgive that if the meat isn't stale. But nope, during my multiple visits I've been greeted with super stale meat to old meat. It's really disappointing to have slightly cardboard-like meat. The pickled veg and peppers are delicious though!

I will admit that I have gone on off-lunch hours. So I can understand why food may not be as fresh due to the hours I go in. But that doesn't excuse the service and I'm not too convinced  that mid-afternoon or evening food should be of that quality.

I hate handing out poor reviews. I would love it if this store to try to improve themselves a bit and train their workers a bit better, as I don't think it deserves to go under."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this location for the last few years and its WAY improved from my last review in 2012. I now work a lot closer and this is my go-to shwarma joint in the city.

There are typically the same two guys behind the counter, both are very nice and friendly and you're almost always greeted with a smile when you place your order. For about $11, I got a chicken shwarma wrap with garlic potatoes and a can of pop. Pretty good value for how much food you get. I had it for lunch and I'll for sure be full at dinnertime!

First of all - garlic potatoes are life. At least these garlic potatoes are! I could BATHE in these potatoes, they're so sinfully delicious. They coat them heavily in some kind of garlic and oil and then today he threw them on the grill to heat them up a bit and then they put more of the white garlic sauce on top. These would be part of my last meal if I had to have one. 

The shwarma here is excellent - they do a great job of cooking it well, so you get lots of delicious crispy bits throughout your sandwich and the chicken is NOT dry, which is something I've found at other joints around the city. All of the toppings are super fresh and you MUST get the garlic sauce AND hot sauce, they make the pita (and the hot sauce isn't like super hot or anything, its like flavor god sauce). Once your shwarma is made, they crisp it up in a press, which gives the outer edges of the pita a nice texture. 

You can't go wrong here - don't bother going to the mall or one of the chain shwarma joints nearby. This place is worth the short walk from Yonge/Gerrard."}
{"text":"The chicken shawarma pita was very good, however not any better than any of the other spots in the area.  The staff are polite and fast.  

The biggest problem I have with this place is that they charge you for some toppings; out of which some are not charged for at the other local shawarma places.  

If the pita and these toppings were clearly better than the other spots, then I would not have a problem with paying extra.  I can't see myself going back again because there are cheaper options that are just as good."}
{"text":"The falafels at Pita Land are scrumptious. Their mini donut-like shape maximizes the crunchy surface area. The lentil soup was rich and thick and stayed hot for a very long time. My discerning dinner date's rating of this entry of chicken shawarma was an 8 out of 10. However, I found their grapeleaves a tad mushy and their tahini strangely reminiscent of ranch dressing though. 

We enjoyed the street-facing counter seating. Although the servers are very friendly, the place is small and the view of the outside can be a nice escape."}
{"text":"My first impression when I walked is that this is a very clean, very well organized establishment. The amount of food they serve is also unbelievable. Lastly, the woman who was serving us was very kind. I would reccommend this place to any hungry people out there."}
{"text":"Delicious chicken shawarma wrap to grab before / after class. I always get everything on my wrap. Based on these reviews, I have to try the potatoes next!"}
{"text":"Ordered on Ritual but was not rdy when i went there, the worker doesn't seem to be well trained and it was obviously too busy for the one worker. So not really the employee's fault. 

Onto the food, $15 for a plate... And it wasnt even that much food. This place not aight"}
{"text":"Picked up a falafel sandwich for lunch and was shocked at the price tag of $6.50!  Nothing out of the ordinary and unnecessarily expensive.

Falafel sandwich was just okay.  I asked for extra pickles and the guy literally added one extra pickle piece.

I don't understand why it was so pricey."}
{"text":"I'm glad I didn't share the same experience as the previous reviewers lol. Ill admit the man behind the counter was not sunshine and raindrops he was very straight to the point, no pleasantries. However, I don't have to tip him so its something I can easily look past for good food. I had the shwarma salad. A good portion of delicious meat served on top of salad with taziki. It was good but I didn't like the pickled veggies in the combination. Tasted off. The food was good enough that I would eat there if I was in the area but not amazing enough for me to by pass restaurants in my area to eat there again."}
{"text":"The service is just so confused.  There were 3 guys working the counter and it might as well have been Larry, Curly, & Moe.  The first guy wss totally out to lunch - when I ordered a chicken container (instead of a wrap) his first response was white or whole wheat?  

Then the three stooges started passing my box back and forth, adding the various components of the combo, instead of passing along in succession like every normal fast food place on the planet. 

The price is also ridiculous!  $16 for this plate of food and a bottle of coke.  The food is meh.  Do yourself a favor and head down the street to Salad House.  You'll get better service, better schwarma, and for less $$$."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I visited last week, we were so hungry and he said his friends come here all the time..so we ordered and honestly the food is really good and filling I suggest getting the shawarma plate or the wrap, my favourite salad is tabouli it's so yummy..also the staff here are so nice and patient! If your in the area and hungry don't pass this place."}
{"text":"Pita Land is a franchise chain serving up Middle Eastern fare. It's close by and it's decent, but a little pricey. The decor is a little more modern with clean lines and fixtures like TV menus. The theme is that of a earthy neutral tone, with beige's, green's, and clay red's. The furniture is cafeteria grade, which fosters the quick in/out for a bite turnover every business is hoping for.

Other than the Shawarma's, food is cooked to order here which is a plus. You have to wait for it, but at least it's freshly cooked. The menu concept is similar to Chipotle in that you pick your main protein (or vegetarian), then you pick your vessel (wrap, pita, pita bowl, plate, etc.). Meals will come with sides of rice, potato, salad, pickled vegetables depending on what you order. This concept minimizes the menu board and maximizes the number of combinations available.

Today, I was looking for a fill of chicken shawarma, and gyros, so we got a dinner plate of each.
Each plate comes with Salad, Rice, Potatoes, and Pickled Vegetables.

Rice. Comes in white (butter) or yellow (seasoned). I opted for the white. While it was long grain, it was not Basmati (Indian) as I hoped. It wasn't Jasmine (SE Asia) either. The butter flavour was also lacking. On it's own, this was a bit of a disappointment. 2 stars.

Tabouli. The best tabouli I've ever had was actually at a friends place. The parsley contained only leaves (no stems) and was not blended in a food processor. There was plenty of bulgur to give it amazing texture, the tomatoes were not soft and mushy, and the onions just slightly on the spicy side. Seasoned with simply EVOO, salt, and lemon juice. Here, the tabouli did contain stems, but other than that, it had all the right ingredients. The stems gave the parsley a much tougher (stringier) texture, but stems seem to be the norm when you eat out, so is the food processor. By comparison, there was a decent balance of ingredients, each making a noticeable contribution to the dish. 3 stars.

House Salad. Ordered with the Gyros, this was your typical iceberg lettuce with bits of carrots and purple cabbage for color. it served as part of the base along with the rice, and was not a notable at all. 2 stars.

Garlic Potatoes. This was actually an item that was not made to order, rather they were sitting under heated trays. While the potato chunks were fully cooked and the garlic flavour stood out. Unfortunately, the heated dish did nothing to keep the skin crispy. If made fresh, this would be a much better dish... .pity. 2,5 stars.

Chicken Shawrama. This was probably the main reason I came here, and it did not disappoint. The chicken was well flavoured and showing only slight signs of drying out as expected from something that is constantly exposed to heat coils.The bigger chunks were moist, tender, and juicy. 4 stars.

Gyros. While this is more of a Greek dish rather than a Middle Eastern one, it not to far a stretch and the cooking modus operandus is essentially the same as Shawarma. Processed beef and lamb seasoned with spices, this dish was not bad either. Not as good as their sharwarma, but not bad. 3 stars.

Pita Land is essentially your average run of the mill joint for Shawarma. It's nothing fancy, but then again, doesn't boast to be. If I had the time, I'd go eat a proper Greek or Middle Eastern meal, but in a pinch, it'll do A-OK. 3 stars.

If you would like to experience more, come dine-with-me.yelp.com I'd love to have your company... Bon Appétit!"}
{"text":"Amazing food amazing quality moderately fast service
It may look sketchy from outside but the food is amazing!"}
{"text":"Food here is always fresh and healthy definitely a great place to get your chicken protein on! :p They greet you as you come in and even say goodbye when you leave! it's like a little home away from home! So...If your a healthy eater and you dig the great prices with lots of meat common down and try this out!"}
{"text":"Best gyro of my life (up to this point). 

We, like a fellow poster were heading towards Tim Horton's next door when I noticed the sign and came here (in addition to Timmies). Door was open, lots of people with food in their hand outside, at 11pm, had to be good, right? Yep. 

Not being a wrap fan, and having pita in the name I was hoping for a real pita, it looked like a wrap, but whatever it was, it was warm, cooked to perfection. Flaky, likely homemade (not chewy and slimy as wrap carcasses tend to be). 


Meat was perfection and piled high inside, and just a enough nip to make you feel alive.

A choice of additional sauces that could have been added in addition to tzatziki and a plethora of toppings to choose from including 3 or 4 kinds of olives if that was your fancy. Chicken style gyro avail too, would like to try that in future at some point... once all my kicks are satisfied with the traditional gyro. 

Skip the samosas, or maybe it was just left too long under the lights, ok but nothing to write home about.

A great find!"}
{"text":"This is my favourite shawarma/souvlaki food!

It was close by to my old house, it was always open, the staff is friendly. I have moved away from this area, actually out of town and MISS this place. This is a fast food place which is healthy and filling, price point isn't cheap as McDonald's but here you are getting real food with real taste and flavour.

My favourite is the Chicken Souvlaki with pilaf rice and potatoes.

Next time I visit Brampton I will make sure I stop by and re-live my love for Pita Land."}
{"text":"This place was pretty yummy.  The restaurant is clean and everything is brand new as it moved into where a cheque cashing place used to be.  All of the ingredients are fresh, the staff is friendly and there are lots of them.  I counted 5 people working.

This location is busy already, having been open for only 5 days.  They're getting lots of foot traffic with the subway station near by.  This is the second place within a 1/2 km radius of my house claiming to be the best shawarma.  Let the shawarma war begin!!

My only complaint is that it's cash only, though they do have an ATM on site and there's a TD across the street."}
{"text":"The best chicken shawarma plate I've ever had.  And their potatoes are so good!  The only thing stopping me from giving it 5 stars is the price. For a chicken shawarma plate and feta on my salad its almost $15.  

Super friendly staff too!"}
{"text":"This is the first ever Pita Land I ever been to and it won't be the last.

Service was fast and efficient. And so many condiments and toppings to choose from! 

I loaded my chicken shwarma with all these fresh toppings and made that into a big meal. Frankly the chicken was a little dry but the toppings did help a lot.

Staff here is super friendly and full of energy. Tables were also wiped down constantly."}
{"text":"To begin, the service was okay. It definitely could've been better. 

The food? So good! I got the chicken shawarma plate and I fell in love. It comes with rice, grilled chicken, salad (in which you get to choose what you want added), potatoes and a few different sauces (you also get to choose).

To be honest, I would've gave Pita Land a better rating IF the food wasn't so expensive for a take-out place and if the service was a bit better. It was around $35 for just two shawarma platters. An additional $1 for toppings such as cheese, olives, etc. (I didn't add any toppings and it was that much). So if you're on a budget, this is definitely not your place.

P.S. I prefer this location over the Downtown Toronto location."}
{"text":"Came here late one night to get food, because we were in the area and decided to get take out. The service was okay, but it can definitely improve. When we were ready to cash out, the server didn't even tell us the total and asked how are we paying, that was kind of annoying (usually they'd tell you before asking how we're paying).  

I got the chicken shawarma plate and I loved the rice & chicken with the white sauce drizzled on top. The salad, however, did not taste fresh at all. I didn't like that part.

Overall, I would return to Pita Land, but maybe try a different location."}
{"text":"I don't know what sauce they put on the shawarma but it's full of flavour and it keeps me coming back. I really like the shawarma dinner when it's fresh... Mouth watering!"}
{"text":"Dropped in for lunch a few days ago. As with the first experience, food was great. Garlic Potatoes smothered in hot sauce and tzatziki (sp?)....amazing.
We both opted for gyros.....not disappointed at all. It was flavourful, warm and the wrap was fresh.
Will go back again"}
{"text":"Best sharwarma in Ajax, plate and wrap are so delicious. Prices are a little high than other places"}
{"text":"$13 got me a shawarma plate. Some white rice, 3 small patatoes, lettuce, onions, tomatoes, and some chicken. The normal toppings like hummus parsley were extra. Small portions! Save your money, there is a reason they are never busy and there are much better places with bigger portions in the same area."}
{"text":"This fast food restaurant is strangely under-staffed. Thur July 29th at 4:20 pm - snack time right? There's just one girl working the counter, and like a scene in a comedy movie, she was scrapping the grill really loudly when we got there, and continued doing it for time eternal as we waited for her to turn around and look at us and take our orders. Chicken souvlaki plate is what i wanted to get, and for some reason I wanted to get it on a ceramic plate because I saw it in the picture - included in my review. Anyway I was real sad that I had to increase my carbon footprint by eating on Styrofoam so I switched to chicken schwarma pita served in waxed paper and it was fine. Tasted pretty good in fact. Do you think society could pressure fast food restaurants to serve on ceramic plates again, like the early to mid 1900s,,, before Styrofoam was invented?"}
{"text":"Ummm how have I not gone in to this place sooner? Yummmmm!!!! So this place is absolutely delicious. Today was a cold and windy day and the chicken Shawarma I had just warmed me right up!!! The place was clean, staff was very friendly and did I say the food was delicious? I would definitely recommend this place to a friend and I will be back 100%. Thank you Pita Land"}
{"text":"To start with the positive, it is very clean and tidy in here. Food prep area all looked very clean and the menu was clearly displayed.

Unfortunately, the food was very bad. I ordered the falafel plate, which at $11.99 was not inexpensive. The falafel balls were pre-made and thrown into a deep-fryer that didn't seem to be set to temperature while the rest of my plate was prepared. While the inclusion of potatoes was a nice touch, they were cold and had clearly been sitting for a while. I had to ask twice to have hummus and garlic sauce included, though that might have been because the hummus was very, very bad. I'm not sure what the issue was, I have never had hummus like that. None of the veggie items were fresh, although they were all attractively arranged and uniform in colour.

I would honestly recommend any other shawarma/falafel place in the area."}
{"text":"Little pricey for the quantity. nice clean place good location 
Lentil soup was good so were the garlic potatoes 
Good place to get a quick lunch"}
{"text":"The wraps here are solid but be careful because feta, jalapeños, tabouli, olives, etc. will cost you extra. I got the 12' falafel wrap with all the extras for around $14 with no drink or sides. The falafel wrap was great with all the additions. The falafel was great because of all the add ons which added tons of flavor and keep the falafel moist but overall I thought it was expensive. I know, I know, eating out is expensive but this is only worth the money if you are craving a solid wrap. If you get a wrap without the extras and aren't that hungry you can get a 8.5' wrap for around $8-$11 with no drink or sides. Check it out for yourself..."}
{"text":"I don't know what everyone has experienced but I have never had anything short of the perfect falafel wrap here. If im having a hard day and need extra protein I go here. They never disappoint and I've been here many times as this place is along the way to my house. Nice employees too!"}
{"text":"Service is amazing, the older gentleman that works there is always giving free little extras when you order your meal and the FOOD IS SPECTACULAR.

They seriously must put nicotine in their lentil soup because I am completely addicted and actually get cravings. Just so delicious and the shawarma wraps are great too. Everything is fresh and ready to order. The restaurant is SPOTLESS, there wasnt one speck of dirt or dust or anything at this location.

Just awesome."}
{"text":"i needed dinner for work one day, i was craving some good pita, after, a previous place, left a very, Very, VERY bad taste in my mouth. 
driving here from work was funny, my first thought was that, \"this place is attached to a gas station?\" 
i got three very decent pitas for my dinner for work, two chicken shawarma and one falafel. 
the toppings that come with this pita, is fantastic, by far the most toppings available that i have seen, the blend of the chicken\falafel was amazing with these new toppings that i have not been able to find at other shawarma places. 

i defiantly will come back, and i hope anyone and everyone tries this place, even if its just once, travelling into toronto, or up north for the day. one of my highest recommendations"}
{"text":"I live in the area and only wish we could have a decent shawarma place.

SKIP THIS PLACE if you are craving shawarma.

The food is really bad here, cannot believe anyone can give this place 5 stars.... isn't 5 stars reserved for \"must try this place!!\" ??

We ordered 2 chicken shawarma sandwiches and 1 shawarma platter.

1) the food is especially greasy, even the salad!

2) meat is really really dry, hard, and hard to chew.. it feels like the meat has been left out for a long time in the roaster, maybe because it's not very busy here?

3) the service is insanely slow, it took almost 20 minutes to get our order... at other places all this and more is ready within 8 minutes maximum (you guys have all been to other shawarma places you know what to expect!)

4) the sauces are really messed up and make the food not even taste like a standard shawarma. They offered us \"Greek or Italian\" sauce... wtf? We tried each one since they were the only options. One was freaking sweet and the other was ultra sour... who would put this on shawarma meat?? 

5) they charged us extra for tabouli (traditional Lebanese salad composed of tomatoes and chopped parsley) -- what we got was literally 2 teaspoons and they charged us $3 for that??

This place gets 2 stars because it's clean, and because I only give 1 stars to places where I find hair in my food. 

Take my advice, SKIP this place if you are looking for a shawarma fix, you won't find it here (unfortunately..)"}
{"text":"The first place I ever had shawarma. Also my favourite. This place is amazing. From its long hours, to its perfect location, this Pita Land, serves some of the best shawarma I have ever eaten. The chicken is incredibly seasoned, and the sauces add a burst of flavour with every bite. A delicious place to visit, thanks to their variety of foods. Would totally recommend!"}
{"text":"I was in search of a quick fix Sunday night dinner. I was in the mood for fast food but something more then the average burger and fries when I remembered this is little place!

Not only does Pita Land serve up Pitas but they make Beef/Chicken Sharwarmas, Gyros, Falafels, and Chicken Souvlaki as a plated meal too if your not feeling the wrap vibe. It's a long narrow restaurant with a good amount of seating for a restaurant its size and also very clean. They also serve a variety of Middle Eastern Appetizers, Salads, Soups, and Desserts + everything here is 100% Halal.

After looking over my options I decide to go for the Chicken Souvlaki Plate.
The chicken is grilled to order on a flat top, it comes out tender, moist, and flavourful. They serve it on top of an ample portion of fragrant bastmati rice and cover it in tzatziki and hot sauce (if you like). On the side you get your choice of fresh veg from the salad bar, I chose lettuce, tomato, spiced onions, hot peppers, and pickled turnips (love the turnips!) topped with a simple tangy vinaigrette. As well the meal comes with the most flavourful lemony roasted potatoes on the side.

Overall fast, fresh, delicious middle eastern fare, the staff here are friendly and explain the dishes to new comers if your not familiar. Definitely check it out for a yummy change of flavour!"}
