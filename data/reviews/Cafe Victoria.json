{"text":"Amazing spicy noodle soup here, with a poached egg on top. A very reliable sandwich/breakfast spot. Lovely people. I get their very fresh fruit salad almost every day, and the spicy noodle soup at least once a week."}
{"text":"I go here for Bibimbap. I like it.
Served really quick, egg cooked to order. Sauce is nice."}
{"text":"I was looking for a place to grab a quick breakfast, when I saw this little coffee shop downtown. I ate a sandwich on an English muffin with egg, bacon, and cheese. It was not the usual pre-done breakfast sandwich that you get in places like Tim Hortons or McDonalds: it was hot, tasty, and very yummy.

Don't let yourselves be duped by the look of the venue. The service was good, fast, and the food was great. I don't think these will be the best breakfasts you'll ever have, but it's a nice place to grab a coffee, or just eat something quick."}
{"text":"4 stars ONLY based on their surprisingly delicious cabbage rolls served on Thursdays. These are comparable to the cabbage rolls at the St Lawrence Market, but smaller in size. I have tried other dishes like their mac and cheese and was disappointed. I will only eat their cabbage rolls from now on."}
{"text":"I often visit Cafe Victoria at least 1-2 times a week for lunch.  They have 4-5 different lunch specials every day, and sandwich/soup specials.  

Their prices are quite competitive, (between $7-10 including tax) for lunch specials, which are usually Korean-inspired such as chicken terriyaki, stir fry, bulgogi, etc.
I'm not quite sure what day, but they have cabbage rolls, with a choice of rice, mashed potatoes or vegetables.  You receive 2 cabbage rolls which are huge, stuffed with a large portion of ground beef.  They are the best cabbage rolls I have ever had with a nice tomato sauce, and the ground beef is not too peppery.  I think altogether it is either 7.33 or 7.90 (including tax).

I am always full after eating here.  And unlike some of the other takeout places, they have multiple servers, so the line moves very quickly even if there are people in front of you.  So if you're in the area, this would be a great choice for lunch!  They have eat-in, but the furnishings are a bit antiquated."}
{"text":"Very personable service. They are efficient and kind. I highly recommend this place if you need to grab a quick and cheap breakfast!"}
