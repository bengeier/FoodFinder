{"text":"I must admit that when I first heard my date was taking me here, I was disappointed because the name had me tricked into thinking we were going to some strange mixture between a jazz bar and coffee lounge.  However, don't be like me and let the strange name fool you; Restaurant Bazz Java Jazz is not a cafe and it doesn't play any jazz music!

Bazz Java Jazz is actually a contemporary French restaurant that serves delicate and beautiful dishes worthy of praise.  Despite its quirky name, this restaurant is nothing but strange; it is intimate, romantic, warm, and sophisticated.  

I would recommend this place an ideal spot for a special date.  The music is played very low, the lights are soft, and the service is professional and personable.  The restaurant is small but tastefully decorated.  It's one of the few modern French places that still believes in dressing tables in white linen, and I'm all for table cloths on special occasions.  In fact, the entire restaurant gives the feeling that you're dining in a good friend's home, which makes the ambiance very warm, cozy, and inviting.  

As for the food, it is simply mouthwatering.  The menu list is refined and contemporary, serving up French fare that shows finesse (okay, enough with the alliteration).  The presentation is nice, as well, and did I mention that it's bring your own wine?  

Definitely make a reservation here if you're in the south shore and if you want to try an unexpected gem of a restaurant.  I love this place, and I can't wait to go back with my loved one!"}
{"text":"Magnifique terrasse située à l'arrière, intime.

Excellent service discret, attentionné, de bons conseils.

C'est un restaurant \"Apportez votre vin\" (prévoqyez une bonne bouteille)

La crème brûlée au foie gras, garnitures de petits fruits et pain brioché grillé est délicieuse.

J'ai pris un \"burger\" en dessert. C'est en fait un scone (pain à burger), galette de ganache au chocolat (viande), fraise(tomates) et  bâtonnets de mangue ( frites), petites guimauves(fromage), coulis de fruits rouges (ketchup)

Un peu cher (60$ par personne), c'est surtout pour une occasion spéciale"}
{"text":"Food was bellow par (in that price range), was disappointed with my plate and waiter said \"I know we should take it off the menu\", why not tell me in advance? Place is tight, they try to fit way too many tables in their limited space. Took an hour an a half before we got our main. There's way better places out there, don't bother."}
