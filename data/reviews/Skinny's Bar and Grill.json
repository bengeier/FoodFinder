{"text":"Great local Bar and awesome crowd... The Wings are must and don't forget about their pizza!!"}
{"text":"I'm from out of town, stopped in at skinny's. It's a low key bar. They have alcohol. I drank some of it. Had a grand time."}
{"text":"This place defines why local bars can be great. Small crowd, good atmosphere and the 1%'ers need not attend. You'll be waited on by someone with a good line or 2 and a pleasant attitude.  Don't bother trying to order a foo foo drink here but you can get most any Budweiser you want!"}
{"text":"\"Good food, good atmosphere, all around a must stop when I go to Cleveland! The Viking Burger is a fav and love the wing selection.  There are always great specials.\""}
{"text":"Cash only. Amazing food. Always homemade & fresh. The best wings in Cleveland hands down. The Viking Burger & Jambo is a must as well. The only serve wings on Mon & Wed,dont know why. The cajun fries are great. Its a big St.Joes (VASJ) hangout as well as a firemen hangout. The staff is friendly the food prices are unbeatable. They have daily specials on the big board behind the bar. No matter what u order your gonna come back for more at this place. Its where are the locals go to drink & eat,so u know its good!"}
{"text":"My co-workers and I drop into Skinny's after work on Friday evenings.  Such a great little place.  No pretentiousness; no BS-- just a great little dive bar.  The servers are sweet and on the ball.  Drinks and food are very affordable.  Nothing fancy about Skinny's and that's what makes it great!!"}
{"text":"I no longer live in the area, but I make it a point to stop by when I'm in town. I've never been there during the evening, only for lunch so my review is strictly for the food, not the ambiance of the bar. The Viking burger is to die for - a huge burger patty topped with tender sirloin steak tips. The service is usually fast but rarely has it been very friendly. But that's fine too, I'm not looking for a new BFF...I'm only there for the food."}
{"text":"This is a place unchanged, out of 1960's Euclid and that in itself is worth a visit. The reason for our visit was a group of old friends getting together to humorously hector each other under the guise of trying their Cleveland.com acclaimed wings. The effort was well worth it. The bar service was excellent and prices below average. The wings are way above average and the price was notably less than franchises like BW3 or Harry Buffalo. The important point is that these wings are above average in size and have the desirable uniqueness of a crunchy skin with juicy meat. Something that most much higher priced wing joints in the area can't produce for a significant price premium. There are many toppings for the wings. All we tried were very good, but I would recommend that one goes for the unique \"everything\" topping as it's euphemistically referred to. Why this place only offers these spectacular wings on Monday and Wednesday evenings is not cool. Other good things: It's not a sports bar with wallpaper of flat panel TVs blaring. You can comfortably bring your little kids, as one family did, and was acknowledged by every 4th visitor entering the bar with a warm greeting to them. Now the problems. The wings are definitely worth a visit but realistically they take 30 minutes after ordering. I would recommend sending in a frontrunner to grab a table, preoder several wings orders for the group and then have a cold draft beer in a frosted glass until the rest of the gang arrives. This place is a gem."}
{"text":"I'm not the best to judge it by its food cause I'm a vegetarian. Yet the chicken ala skinny minus the chicken is good, the coleslaw rocks, Mac and cheese when they have it good, and the fried pickles the bomb. Wait staff are are different and cool in their own way. They provide THE best service. Tip them well. Genny on tap. Yeah."}
{"text":"Amazing little neighborhood bar & grill! Great staff & amazing food!  Did a search for the best burgers in Euclid, and Skinnys was at the top of the list. The burger was great, but the other food coming out of the kitchen looked amazing also!  The staff was fun and very engaging, took pictures with me and made you feel like they were happy you were there. I would definitely go back and try something else, definitely a surprise."}
{"text":"I love wings more than I love granny porn so I came to this place because I read on Cleveland.com that they got voted 3rd or 4th best wings in the city or somethin...  I have been here to to drink a few times after work, but never tried the food.  So, after stopping 3 different times I was told each time that I was either on the wrong day or too early in the day....I STILL have not had the wings.   WTF.  One would think if ya get a good writeup a tiny-ass place would wana capitalize on the good press and SELL SOME FRICKING WINGS!!  I cannot understand that a bar would only sell wings 2 days a week...and at night to boot.  In case you havent noticed Peuclid is not exactly a thriving metropolis..it could use good press and some people willing to throw down some money.   Leave all the arrogant, douchy crap like that for other places...  Guess they never heard of a refrigerator or something.  The place does have a cool, working-class/Irish feel and has Genny Bock for 1.50 a glass.  That is the only reason its getting 2 stars.  But by how they are going about things I bet they dont even care.  Kiss my butt Skinnys...ill get wings somewhere else."}
{"text":"If you want a great local bar where you walk in and everyone knows everyone, then this is the place you want to go to. The bartenders know your drink and the chef even comes out to make fun of you if you order 5 pickles (just because you love pickles).   The atmosphere, I give a 5. The only reason I am giving 3 starts is because the food is just bar food. Nothing special. It is greasy like bar food, but not in a bad way. They have good burgers, good fries, great pickles (!), but it's nothing you will leave and say \"I will never have something like that again!\" because you will at your next local bar.   It is the hangout in Euclid and it is a fun atmosphere to watch a sporting event or go grab drinks with a friend!"}
{"text":"5 stars for a couple reasons and let me note that I'm reviewing a divey bar with not much competition in the area (within a mile or so) but the food is fantastic.  I can tell you that all the food I've tried (clam chowder, burger, fish sandwich, chicken sandwich) has all been homemade, fresh, and carefully prepared, no greasy spoon BS here.  Place is small and can get busy so be sure to get there at a reasonable time.  No pool, no darts, pretty sure theres a jukebox, but I really only go there for food, especially for lunch (prefer over Panini's).  Last time Skinny bought us lunch just for the hell of it which I thought was super cool.  Be sure to check out their specials too, I'm sure they are delicious.  Crowd is very middle class.  Cash only but there's an ATM inside.  Don't be scared to go in, you'll be sad you didn't venture in sooner.  Lot's of firefighters come here after work."}
{"text":"Best bar in the Cleveland area. Great homemade grub with character. The viking burger and jambo are the staples. Drinks are priced right, solid blue collar crowd."}
