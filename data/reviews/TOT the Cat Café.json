{"text":"This is a very late review but I like the fact that they're helping cats so I figured I should write my experience. :)

Came here a year or 2 ago. It's a very small cafe since half the area is used for the cats, and with customer in there - it can get a little cramped. But still, the staffs are extremely nice - everyone was in a good mood (how can you not when there are fluffy kittens waiting to be pet).

The menu was extremely reasonably priced. I got a cheese cake and hot chocolate. I'm pretty sure they import the cake from somewhere, but nonetheless it was good. The hot chocolate was made by the staffs and it was pretty good as well. I would definitely visit again and recommend any cat lovers to visit."}
{"text":"It's a very small place, not many seats and tables for the amount of people that are waiting to enter the cat room. I love the concept for cat adoption through a cafe where you can play with the cats. The wait time to see the cats was about 40 minutes, not too bad of a wait. The matcha late was very good as was the apple cider. My only complaint about the place is the size, other wise its a great place to stop in on a cold Sunday afternoon."}
{"text":"If it wasn't for the fact that I like cats, I would have rated this place a \"one star\". Having been to Montreal's cat cafe, I think this cafe has many flaws. The point of a cat cafe is to enjoy some good coffee in the company of some nice cats, not to wait in line for 45 minutes to get the right to see some cats in an enclosed space for 15 minutes. The cafe feels like a zoo, whereas Montreal's cafe is more like a cat kingdom, where cats actually have fun and can do tricks for you and where you can have good drinks and food and stay for as long as you want to. The cafe's narrow space is also inconvenient for crowds of customers too."}
{"text":"Adorable cats to be adopted with minimum purchase of $5.00 drinks and snacks, you can donate to get treats for the cats. It is run by volunteers of charity organizations.
Nice environment to relax in downtown area, I did not give a five star rate because waiting time is a little bit long and some cat toys are old.
In general cats here likes people-one of them even likes belly rub-more like a dog!"}
{"text":"Honestly not really worth all the hype. But a fun thing to do if you're in the area. Kind staff. Not much of a cafe however. There's a board full of drink options but there isn't much to eat. When I went the only things available were cheesecake, veggie cups and turkey sandwiches. The approximate wait time to enter the dedicated cat area is 20 minutes, but you must make a purchase beforehand which is reasonable because it gives you just enough time to eat. You also go in groups of about 8. There are no shoes allowed and you must wear slippers, which are provided. The only thing about the cat area is that you have to be a bit wary of some of the cats. Some of them are actually a bit hostile, which actually is understandable considering they are isolated in a small room and have dozens of strangers touching and bothering them. Two of them even tried biting and scratching me. So if you're visiting, make sure to be mindful to the cats. Worth the drop in if you're in the area."}
{"text":"I will not be returning to the cat cafe. I had been very much looking forward to trying out this new spot and received nothing short of a complete let down. The service was awful and the servers treated me as if I were a burden to them. I have been a cat owner my entire life but was appalled at the state of these poor animals. They appeared to be drugged and could not even hold their heads up. As an animal lover going to a cat cafe, I would expect the employees to have the same adoration for animals, however it was evident that they were not concerned with the well beings of the cats, but rather more about there phones. The only good thing about this cafe is the cats can be adopted into there forever homes. I will never return to this establishment, nor do I recommend it to any other potential patrons"}
{"text":"Staff was super friendly and even gave me a free slice of cheesecake as it was my birthday.

The cats are adorable and some (mostly the kittens) were super playful."}
{"text":"Maybe our expectations were too high, but this cat cafe was a disappointment for us. We  expected a kind of \"cat haven\" where cats roamed around freely around all the tables while you had your coffee, etc. Instead, the cats are blocked off in a separate glassed-off room you have to wait to get into, and there were only 6 cats in that room (most were sleeping). Understanding that this might be a health and safety thing since they serve drinks and desserts, I think the clientele who decide to go into a cat cafe expect that they might get the odd hair or two on their table. Maybe they should have a waiver you sign when you come in accepting the risk of the cats roaming around the cafe. Might as well have gone to Pet Smart with a Timmie's in my hand!"}
{"text":"Friendly, kind staff. I ordered the Green Tea Latte w/ soy milk and it was great. The room with the cats is clean and cute. The cats were just adorable, such a great experience. The time limit is 20 mins but since not many people were there we were in the room for about 45 mins. Such a great experience :) Recommended for any animal lover"}
{"text":"Went in December. Cats were great. I mean, they're cats. I'm an animal person, so I had an awesome time there. My friend ended up baiting the cats into chasing the toys there. I personally just sat there scratching the cats to sleep (I mean the ones that weren't already sleeping; I highly recommend you do not scratch an already sleeping cat).

It can get a bit crowded if there's too many people and too many sleeping cats though.

Fun fact I learned that day, cats are amazing predators and are great at catching those butterflies on a stick toys.

Not sure if you're allowed to, but the group before us brought a laser pointer and it was fun watching the kittens chase the dot. Bring one and ask if you can use it if you have one lying around"}
{"text":"The food is mediocre and expensive, but of course that is not what you're here for, so just consider it your entry fee to see the cats.

The cat space is rather narrow and feels a little dirty/run down. Although they tell you not to wear outside shoes into the enclosure, the space where you leave your shoes and where people enter the cafe overlap, so I'm not really sure how taking our shoes off helped as our socks/slippers surely brought in some outside dirt.

They allow too many people into the enclosure at a time, and everyone is just rushing to take photos with the kittens. Definitely not as relaxed as cat cafes in other parts of the world. The customers are rude and do not care that the cats are sleeping or do not wish to be disturbed, they poke the sleeping kitties and nudge them with toys in an attempt to get a response.

The cats are extremely patient and well behaved. A couple of them got adopted while I was there, which is nice.

All in all, I would not recommend visiting TOT. Wait for the other cat cafe to open and hope that it does not make the same mistake as this one."}
{"text":"This place didn't meet my expectations, so I recommend not to go with any - I was disappointed. 

Service sucks. I am still wondering if the cashier believes she is Chloe from Don't Trust The B In Apt 23 orrrrr she's just trying to cop her style (or both). If you use debit, there is a tip prompt which is rather confusing as I've never seen a tip prompt such as that & as I am tipping I am like, \"why am I tipping a rude person who just slumped by overpriced slice of cheesecake onto a paper plate & picked the wrapper off like it was a dead male mosquito?\" So what I am trying to say is, bring cash so you don't have to tip if/when they are rude. Funny watching the cashier roll her eyes & be extremely rude to the girl who does the room wait list. 

The cheesecake was delish enough  (been on a kick lately). I ordered the strawberry white hot chocolate. The drink wasn't hot. It was warm. I comfortably drank half the thing in the first sip/gulp/whatever & even swished it around in my mouth. Ask for extra hot, I guess? 

The human \"litter box\" is renovated, clean & seemingly well kept. They have a full length mirror & great lighting for selfies. The other decor is up to date of your average hipster cafe. 

The cats are obviously the main draw & the cats were being cats - some were playful & some were sleeping. Everyone was pretty respectable of the cats (following the cafe rules which were posted by another user) & too each other even conversing (shocking, I know!). Hope they all find good homes.

You don't have to wear the grody slippers - you can wear your socks."}
{"text":"Cat owners will know that cats require lots of space and freedom. They have wonderful cats but not enough room for all those cats, and hygienically, needs more work."}
{"text":"All you have to do is spend 5 dollars on a food or drink item and you get to go in with the kitties! Really nice staff and pretty spacious and cute :) But expensive but worth it, there's a good selection on the menu but the best part is going in with the cats and getting to spend around 20 minutes!"}
{"text":"I love the cats and I love cold matcha latte! It's nice because you're able to enjoy a drink and play with the kitties. They need air conditioning though because it's very hot but other than that it's a great place. Another great part about this place is that they have an adoption process if you are interested in any of the animals. They work with a rescue from scarborough and I find that amazing especially being a cat owner and one that only adopts. I love that they are able to do this for the cats and for the customers!"}
{"text":"This place was a total disappointment.  My friend and I came here on a Friday night.  To begin, we were greeted at the counter by a man who took our orders and put our names on the wait list. He was not welcoming and his fake robotic form of hospitality felt very disingenuous.  When our time finally came he told us the the rules which included not being able to pet the cats. My friend who went to a cat cafe in Korea was surprised by this as I was too.  What kind of a cat cafe doesn't allow you to pet the cats?  Very strange. The worst part of the night however, came once we entered the cramped rectangular space that the ten or so cats were in.  This space absolutely reeked!  The smell was so putrid that my friend and I could not last more than a minute and ended up leaving the room.  When the man noticed this, he came over to us and started making excuses for the smell, none of which we bought.  We left immediately and will never be coming back here again.  I feel bad for the cats that have to live in such a filthy space."}
{"text":"I feel that the staff of this place truly want to make a difference and help the cats, they really do have authentic hearts, but they have a long way to go. The cats are situated in a cat room with a large floor-ceiling window facing the street. They don't have a human-free space where they can escape all the attention, and people walking by often tap on the glass and disturb them. I wish these kitties had a separate room where they could escape the constant poking and prodding from visitors. Some seemed quite stressed and sleepy. There was also an offensive cat-pee smell in the room and it didn't seem very sanitary. The drinks and cheesecake were enjoyable, and the staff was very friendly, but they need a better set up."}
{"text":"As a cat lover, I obviously love this place!!

One bit of advice, don't come visit in the morning to avoid line ups like me. Cats are creatures of the night and sleep a lot during the day, 4 out of 5 cats were sleeping on my first visit. 

The only reason why I did not give this place a 5 star rating was because of the beverages. The drinks weren't bad, but it didn't blew me away either. Hey, it's a cafe too you know. 

Sitting area is a bit too cosy, but are reasonably clean as are the washroom. 

Definitely must visit if you haven't been there before."}
{"text":"My friend and I turned a corner today while randomly exploring and found this place purely by accident and decided to go in and play with some kitties, all of whom are up for adoption. We ordered some drinks and got a cake (reasonably priced around $5 and quite delicious) as the kitty fee and chit chatted while we waited to play with the kitties (around 50 mins). 

The atmosphere was pretty casual and chill, and the staff were nice. We got to play with the kitties for around half hour or so. It was a simple and relaxing experience and great for me since I don't have a cat but really like them. All the cats were healthy and cute and playful and accustomed to people. I especially loved Memo who was a jerk but super cute lol."}
{"text":"Ah. Seriously ah! It's legit a cat cafe! If you spend $5 or more per person, you can put your name down and once you're called, go into a room and play with cats (with a time limit)!

The owner provide a home for stray cats and customers can come in, play with them and even adopt them! $60 for 6 months and older or $100 for 6 months and younger. Frikken fabulous idea for getting strays off the street and potentially into a loving forever home!

Anyway, the London fog here is good and will return in the future to do some studying and play with adorable cats! Didn't really like the layout of the place because there was a lot of wasted space and not enough natural light."}
{"text":"Their entry fee of a $5 minimum purchase is very reasonable considering in NY, other cat cafes charge $5 USD for a half an hour visit.  But, the places in NYC are modern, well maintained, and like a cat library or hotel. This place, however, needs a helluva lot of TLC, upkeep, and maintenance.  

I feel for these cats.  Fur, dust and dander are everywhere.  The place is hot and the air conditioner barely works.  The a/c ducts have a layer of dust, grime, and dirt.  They need to rework and bring in a new system and an A/C system that works.  I understand this is costly but I can see why articles went up about this place, and why animal shelters had pulled out and ended their collaboration with them.  

Why doesn't the owners care about the appearance of their store and these cats? You either bring in new management who cares for these cats or have another sort of business, like a regular coffeeshop up to code with no living creatures to maintain.  Be civil and accountable.  These cats deserve a better life.  No wonder the cats aren't even friendly-they're miserable.

Butter pecan tarts are too sweet and strawberry yogurt is okay."}
{"text":"TOT cat cafe is awesome! Everything about the cafe, the location, the decor, the food, the drinks and ofcourse the cute kitties was amazing. My friend and I were able to spend time with 4 out of the 5 cats, since the one was sleeping but nonetheless, the cats were very cute and playful.

I will definitely visit this place again and recommend it to all my cat loving friends!"}
{"text":"Nice cafe and nice opportunity for people that want to adopt a furry companion, as you can play with the cats and get to know them in a nice and relaxed room, which is clean and super well equipped for the cats there.

But I had a sweet sour feeling after leaving the cafe, not because of the cafe itself but because of the people (visitors) there. Despite the signs inside the cat room indicating that you cannot pick up the cats or wake them up if they are sleeping, EVERYONE was waking up the adult cats and kittens just to take selfies with them, which I found terrible. We were in the room for 25 minutes and the majority of the cats were either biting the visitors because they were stressed, or desperately trying to get some sleep - which they couldn't because people were petting them or were literally putting toys in their faces.

Maybe the visitors should be controlled a little bit more because, at least that day, nobody cared about the kittens and cats' rest and stress except my boyfriend and me."}
{"text":"This place is so fun! The environment (just the cafe part) is so welcoming and cute, the staff is super friendly and the drinks are great. Few places have hot apple cider, and theirs is fantastic! There are little touches that just make you happy; ie the bathroom is called the litter box. And of course there's a room full of kittens, and that is just the best! Would go again."}
{"text":"I really like the idea here. I just feel like they have very odd rules. It's run pretty systematically. Al in all its a unique idea and the cats are really cute. The room they have them in is pretty small so they're only allowed a certain number of people at a time which I get. It just felt very rushed. I would come back On a slow day to see if the rules Are more slack. Love how they have the option to adopt the cats and donate to the humane society that's a great option."}
{"text":"I love this place!!!! The guy that I think might be the owner was extremely sweet and friendly! The cheesecake was good too! Will definitely come back if I'm ever in Toronto again. The cats are soooo precious!"}
{"text":"Visiting from out of town. Came across this place randomly. Was the first one in at 11:30am (late opening), but the wait was worth it. Kids got to play with cats for an hour. 

Tall asian male helped us out and was super nice. Not sure what the other reviews were referring too him
being robotic or what not. He cares about his cats and it shows. 

Got a mocha which was pretty spot on. Was weird drinking it with \"eau de chat\" in the background, but I got used to it. 

Pricing is a bit odd... $5 purchase or $10 donation. My kids didn't want any coffee so we paid $10/kid and $5 for my mocha. 

Adoptions available for a $150 fee. We're from outta town so passed... this time."}
{"text":"I don't know why people are complaining I had an amazing time! Once you purchase something (any price...) they put you on the waiting list to go to the cat room. We had to wait 45 min cause it was a Friday evening; pretty reasonable. The cat room was amazing! The cats were adorable! Most of them were sleeping, but they're cats they sleep 24/7 lol... Considering the fact that we went on a busy day, we still got to chill with cats and drink our teas! Will def go back"}
{"text":"Really cute cats in a nice room with some tasty matcha lattes and mochas. What better way to spend an afternoon for catlovers?"}
{"text":"Not to be rude or anything but the dude who was at the cafe bar today was kinda creepy and robotic life like he had no soul and was just spewing out the cat rules as if there was no meaning to life. Kinda freaked me out. 

Ordered the Black Moca Cat Latte was it called? Was okay. 

When we went into the cat room omg the smell was intense. It seemed very unhygienic like there was cat hairs everywhere and it just kinda grossed me out sitting anywhere. I'm not sure when the last time they cleaned this place as it was my first time here. 

I found it realy strange that like despite there being a rule about not picking up cats there wasn't a rule that said where you don't touch the cats while they're sleeping (like the cafe at mt pleasant) because every person that was there besides me and my friend where always touching the sleeping cats and waking them up. 

Talk about disrespect for the exhausted cats :( 
Like there were plenty other cats awake even though none of them really seemed like they liked being touched lol so people felt entitled to touch the ones who were sleeping because they were too exhausted to retaliate and stand up and walk away.

I would tbh rather go to the cat cafe near Mt Pleasant because they keep it alot cleaner there, the air doesn't smell like cat excretions everywhere you breathe, and they stress their rules about how to treat their cats more because the owner of the cafe is also the owner of the cats. There's alot more caring involved compared to Tot so

tl;dr never returning."}
{"text":"The owners decided to have reduced hours for the holidays, which makes no sense at all, because this is when many people are out and about. when I tried to visit on January 2, they reached capacity and wait time was around one hour. Outside in the winter. Me thinks not. Not like they give me a pager, so I can return when my turn is up. Nope, they want me standing right by their door and they do not take any reservations. They told me - City of Toronto will do random checks and count people in the room, so yeah I have to wait. I get it - but perhaps limit the time in the cafe for better crowd control? I do not think I am coming back though. Cats are cute and all, but I do not want to waste my time."}
{"text":"The place is alright. 

For those of you who have not been, the cafe is divided into two sections, a small area which is dedicated for coffee drinking, pretty much your standard, low-key, local cafe and a \"cat-quarium,\" a smaller enclosed section where the cats are in. 

You basically purchase a drink and you get 15-20 minutes in the Cat-quarium to play or observe the cats doing their natural, non-circadian following rhythm, which means you have an equal chance to play with the cats are just watch them sleeping.

As an animal person, that means sometimes you might spend more time interacting with a cat than others and I am okay with that. I am empathetic enough not to disturb a sleeping animal although I can imagine others might, that is not a positive. 

Personally, I think the cafe is alright, however, if it was not for the cats, I am not sure how different and noteworthy this locale would be otherwise.  

The cats can be adopted and they have, so that is a good thing. I think the place is not all that bad if everyone is considerate of the animals in question. 

Definitely, a place to check out once if you have not checked it, but I am not sure if I could become a regular."}
{"text":"I would give 5 stars if they took more of my money! Seriously! 

The cat cafe is great, everything about the concept, the location, the decor, the food, the drinks, the service was SUPERB. I wish the cat time is paid though, I don't know how the cafe can open for a long, long time to come, and I wish it can. I really wanted to adopt, and it's a great way for the humane society to work together and have their adorable kitties interact with people. 

I'm a little sad that we only got 15 minutes with the cats, but seeing how we lined up for 30 minutes, I get it. The human:cat ratio was about 2:1 so it wasn't ideal...

Generally an awesome experience, just 1. MORE CATS and 2. TAKE MORE OF MY MONEY! Maybe having a bigger space might help, and you're not going to get a bigger space until you start running this like a greedy for-profit business :)"}
{"text":"This seems to be the only Cat Cafe in downtown, visited on Saturday afternoon. The cafe was crowded and there was wait time of 40mins to visit the cat house.

The dude at the counter was extremely rude. Talking to him felt like filling a form which you cannot submit unless you fill it the way it's programmed!

We ordered Black Cat Mocha, which was well made, 5/5 for the coffee.

The cost is $5 min purchase or $10 fee (which they call donation) which I found absurd. They have limited food options, vague seating and strategically priced items below $5 to make you spend more. I don't mind paying, but let's make the model simple.

The cat house was clean and all cats seemed healthy. However I felt that it was like a factory model, with wait lists and guests churning out every few mins."}
{"text":"Interesting concept for animal lovers out there who don't want to go to the conventional coffee shop. There is however a limited selection for coffee and dessert so consider this a quick stop for a bite or drink while spending time with a cuddly fuzzy companion."}
{"text":"Friendly service, great drinks, and the whole cat experience is very enjoyable -  even if two of the cats are sleeping.

This is a great new business with a lot of heart, working with the Humane Society to get more cats adopted, and I think everyone should support it."}
{"text":"Though I have mixed feelings about cat cafes, I appreciate that the cats here are all up for adoption and are likely to find homes faster than at the shelter. My main concern is that the novelty and location of the cafe attract lots of people who think the cats are there for their entertainment. So to the detractors, guess what? Cats sleep... A lot. They aren't going to wake up for your amusement. Be mindful when they are resting or if they aren't in the mood to play! Please don't grumble about being bored because it's all for a good cause."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the experience in this cat cafe and the cats are so cute and friendly! I will visit this cafe more often:) Please check out our youtube video for the experience.

{"text":"I think this is a really great place for anyone who isn't able to keep a cat or other pet at home for whatever reason, but still enjoys the company of an animal. I ordered a café latte (it was good) and added my name to the waiting list for the cat room.  I had to wait maybe 7-8 min. or so before my turn, which was alright as I had a good view of the cats from outside the room anyway. The cats themselves were very cute and as someone who doesn't have any pets I enjoyed being able to interact with them. You can enjoy your drink while in the cat room (as long as you keep it out of the kitties reach). I went on a Sunday around 11:30 am and it wasn't too busy, but by the time I left about an hour later the place were pretty packed, so if there's anything I recommend visitors do, it's to come earlier rather than later!

**Update** 2016/05/10 So apparently there is some rumor going around that Tot Cat Café has \"neglected\" its cats. A former employee wrote a post on Facebook-a post that has apparently now been taken down, which I find suspicious-claiming the cats were horribly neglected by the cafe owners (underfed, not given enough water, etc.) and that she left the job because she couldn't take care of the cats by herself anymore. 

This surprised me greatly, as I have visited the cafe several times now and the cats have always appeared healthy and happy, and there was always plenty of food and water in their bowls-in fact, I thought they might actually be overfed! But I decided to visit once again today, concerned that things had gone severely downhill since my last visit. I was very relieved to see that the cats presently there appeared to be in good health and spirits-in fact, they were probably the friendliest cats I've encountered there to date. I saw no signs of neglect or abuse. Everything else from my original review still stands.

However this person's post seems to have set off a new slew of complaints and accusations about the cafe and particularly its cat room-some of which I believe are justified, but others are just plain silly.

Yes, both the seating area outside the cat room and the cat room itself could use some work in terms of decorum, which is why I won't give a five-star rating. The walls of the seating area could use a cleaning, as well as some sort of posters or artwork, but to say the cat room is disgusting and an unacceptable living space is, in my opinion, ridiculous. Yes, the room sometimes smells a bit, probably because-surprise!-like all animals, including humans, cats tend to have their own scent! Thankfully, there is now a small air conditioner in the corner of the cat room which I think will help mitigate that. And yes, the fabric covering the benches and part of the floor has tears in some spots, probably because-surprise!-cats like to scratch things! 

The employee also went on to say that the Toronto Humane Society has reportedly taken back the cats it had given the cafe. According to some recent CBC and Metronews articles I found discussing the issue, the director of THS has stated that all of the cats taken back were in good health, and the main reason for their severing ties with the cafe was simply due to a difference in philosophy-the non-profit Humane Society vs. a for-profit cafe-and NOT due to abuse. I know there are other animal agencies in the area, so I am eager to see which one the cafe will partner with instead. 

I don't want to jump to conclusions, and if substantial evidence IS found to prove the cats are being abused, the cafe should certainly face the consequences. But I have a very hard time believing an establishment that went through so much red tape just to open up would deliberately mistreat its main attraction, especially when it was being monitored by the Toronto Humane Society. I will continue to support the cafe unless substantial evidence of animal abuse is found through a proper and thorough investigation, as I just can't put much faith in a (now deleted) Facebook post by one individual."}
{"text":"I came here with 2 of my close friends during 6~7 pm today. The line-up wasn't too horrid during this time however; the place was still pretty packed. As for the menu, there were many selections of drinks to choose from but not a lot of food was offered. I ordered the Black Cat Mocha, it was alright! (It did take a while to receive the drink since there was currently only 1 barista working). The café also offers free wifi.

After receiving the drink, my friends and I were able to sign up to go see the cats. The cats were in a secluded sections near the door. Before entering there were 3 main rules you had to follow: 1. You cannot pick up the cats 2. Don't disturb the cats that are asleep and 3. No flash photography. Also before you enter, you have to take off your shoes and you have the options to go in with your socks or wear these really cute adorable cat slippers. You are also allowed to bring in your coats,bags, and beverage inside the room too.

When my friends and I went inside, the lady working stated that there was 8 cats inside however; some of them were still timid and shy since they were getting use to the new environment. We were in there for approximately 15~20 minutes and all the cats had different personalities, some more playful than others. There were also cute cat paw cushions to sit on. I also find it wonderful how you can adopt the kittens too, all of them are adorable!!

Overall it was an OK experience. The beverages were so-so, the staff were friendly, and atmosphere was enjoyable. Although I really wished there were more cats within the room. There were 9 people in total and 8 cats BUT subtract 2 of them since they were sleeping. I personally felt that my friends and I (the three of us) didn't get enough time with the cats, but nonetheless; everything was OK."}
{"text":"Very cute cats! I visited during lunchtime and waited only 10 minutes. I was hoping the cafe could have a larger area for people to relax and playing with cats. It is already a decent place for cat lovers to have some fun!"}
{"text":"Worst experience. Never coming back here and I don't recommend it to anyone. If I could give it minus 10 stars I would.  
The two female servers were extremely rude and disrespectful. Passive aggressive in every word said. They were condescending and actually walked away from me as I was talking. Who does that? Are you an employee or in high school?

I called in the morning to see if I could reserve as I read there were long lines. I was told no but they close at 8 and take in the last person at 730pm. I had been telling my daughter all day she will meet the cats and we would adopt one. We drove half an hour, arrived at 7pm only to be turned away in the rudest manner possible. My daughter was crying as we left wanting to see the cats. 

They had zero flexibility and zero empathy instead the blond waitress told me aggressively that I should have called right before leaving. I spoke to the two owners and they said it was a long day. That's no excuse for poor manners and customer service. Seemed like they were taking orders from the two servers. Odd. 

I strongly advise anyone to never set foot in this disgrace of an establishment and instead visit the humane society."}
{"text":"When I  read \"cat café\" my brain showed the image of my feline daughters playing (in a Mc Donald's style playground), while I drank coffee watching them interact with other's \"kids\"...

When I arrived here I had crossed feelings with the concept as a whole. I was trying to solve the puzzle about the main intention of this place.

Do they want to just help certain aged cats on shelters to find a home? 

I've been in a couple of shelters, so I learnt the bitter truth of Toronto: stray cats are plenty, they flood the streets during summer reproducing every few months (with 2-5 creatures per litter...), they are cute, but not adequately for everyone.

Don't assume friends or family will take care of them:  \"Please don't give away alive presents\" (specially during Christmas).

Kids could be mean/rough/bullies with kittens: you won't like a kittens's defence against your baby... 

You can dream about dressing-decorating your feline friends, however, each one has it's own will, personality and tolerance against human desires.~

I was expecting a different mechanic because this joint has a lot of potential. I believe in improvement, so I'm sure they took a decisive step towards responsible petting/parenting.

As the crazy cat lady I am, I'll always support whatever that benefits homeless cats."}
{"text":"Super cool premise and I ADORE their dedication to finding homes for these cats.  

The coffee was just okay. 

We didn't mind the 20 minute wait to get in the cat room but 15/20 minutes wasn't quite long enough to meet the cats as you stand around watching other people pet them. I finally got a chance with one cat in particular ( that I would have about adopting) but a kid kept interrupting poking the cat with a toy... My friend had the same experience and the cafe folks nor her mom did anything to stop her from being so rough (and rude).

Also, its really awkward trying to take your shoes off, and get them back on after in a tiny hallway with 25 other people.It may just be circumstantial but I think if they want more cats to find a home, smaller groups in the room would be better or better monitoring perhaps. 

I will go back when it's not as busy (and get a tea) to spend a few more minutes with the kitties."}
{"text":"Great place!  Hope they stay open for a long time.  Coffee was great!  Muffins were awesome.  Very relaxing and fun!"}
{"text":"If your fantasy is to roll around the floor with dozens of fluffy kittens smothering you, I'm afraid you're in for a disappointment. But if you want to interact with 3-4 cats that are lounging around and doing their own cat thing, then this is a pretty nifty place.

The highly anticipated cat cafe is actually made up of two separate areas: a small cafe  and a cat enclosure that you can bring your lidded drinks into. We were able to get there soon after they opened and there were already a few people ahead of us. We probably waited 10 minutes to get in. In that time, we bought a tart, some fruit, and a matcha latte. Nothing outstanding, just regular cafe things. One issue is that there aren't really any seats (very limited in the cafe and in the cat space) so most of the time, you're just standing around. 

Reading the previous reviews about them being disorganized, I think they've made improvements. They have signs up now that clearly explain you need to purchase something to sign up for the wait list. When your name is called from the wait list, an employee explains the general rules (open one door at a time, don't pick up the cats, take off your shoes, etc.) The people that work there were all very courteous. 

Usually there were more people than cats but there were still ample opportunities to interact with them. 3/4 of the cats were very chill with humans in their space (the last one was a bit shy). The black one with white paws rubbed against everyone's legs while purring. :D 

Overall, it's a neat experience. Hot beverages are always nice in the winter and I'm pretty sure petting cats is a natural de-stressor. What's great is that they also have an adoption process in place. Come in for a cappuccino, go home with a cat-puccino (sorry).

{"text":"Nothing special...its definitely not what u would expect... cats are enclosed in a psecial room where u gotta sign up and line up for to get in... ans play with them for ten min...but a lot of these cats were not selected to be playful cats (they are from the humane society) so most of them dont even play with u... i mean the idea is cool but the execution of the cafe didnt work out very nice"}
{"text":"We took our nieces here.  We had to put our name onto the waiting list as the cats are all in a different room.  It was a very long wait before we got a chance to go in.  (approx 35-40 min wait).  Our nieces got a bit restless waiting.  We were only able to get 2 seats too so we had to stand and wait.  Once we got into the room with the cats, most of the cats were sleeping. At that time, there were only 4 cats there.  2 were hiding.  1 was sleeping. The other one was playful but that's the one that everyone wanted to go and see.  

The coffee/hot chocolate was ok.  But I think I'd rather go elsewhere for the coffee/hot chocolate. But we had to spend money on something to see the cats.  Will probably not come back."}
{"text":"A bit disappointed with the cat cafe. I was expecting more cats but there were only three that were there. I've seen other cat cafes and they were much bigger with more cats. There were also way too many humans compared to cats when we got to go inside the glass room - like 8 humans to 3 cats. The cafe itself was rather cramped given the small space and the fact that there were so many people waiting to get seated. Lattes were good. Overall I'm stoked that Toronto finally has a cat cafe. Not too thrilled about how few cats there are and the overall quality of the cafe."}
{"text":"Had an amazing day at the cat cafe earlier this week. If I'm not eating brunch somewhere down lakeshore, I'll be here playing with cats and enjoying a black cat mocha!! 

So good"}
{"text":"I went with my fiancé yesterday and this place is full of so much love. It was my fiancé birthday and he received a cheese cake free of charge. The server was polite and you can feel how much they care about the cats. The drinks were amazing and the cheese cake is so good everyone should try it. We will definitely come back and maybe adopt a cat next time."}
{"text":"Nahhhh. Not for me.
You can't pick up the cats, the room is really small and narrow, the lady with the glasses who works here hates her life and makes sure you know that.
I would not return here."}
{"text":"Okay let me start off by saying that I've always wanted to come to a cat cafe so as soon as I walked by this one I was pretty much having a heart attack because I needed to come in. Three days later and I finally got to see the cats. There are some rules, you have to pay a minimum of 5 dollars to come in and touch the cutie pies, and no shoes allowed. They also give you a time limit since it's pretty popular. 
The cats are so freaking adorable. I already want to take them all home. It is a cafe but honestly it's more about the cats. The coffee is regular so you're pretty much paying to touch the cats. The staff are friendly and it's definitely been an experience."}
{"text":"We really want to support their effort, it's our heartbeat.  Calling them and trying to make arrangements for special needs was very frustrating.  We were preached at like we wanted special privileges when we wanted things to be safe.  So happy they are getting cats adopted out, so sad they made it difficult for us to help."}
{"text":"I love what they're doing and the cats are adorable but we got the fruit cup and half-way through we noticed that the pieces of apple were covered in black mold!! When we brought it to the attention of the employee he was super cavalier/unsympathetic about it, said they were made \"today\" (highly doubt judging by how gross it was) and gave us another one, which smelled bad and we threw away. I didn't push it further because they're providing a great service, but I wanted to bring it to attention here because it's a huge food safety issue and I was shook."}
{"text":"Visited the cafe again except this time I went early in the morning (right after opening). Since there was hardly anyone at all I was able to spend a whole hour in the cat room, and it wasn't crowded either. The new cats that were brought in are very cute, and the five original ones are all adopted now!"}
{"text":"You need to pay $5 or more (before tax) in order to have access to the room with cats. There are around 10 cats in the room and they're all fairly friendly. I use the word \"fairly friendly\" because some of them will hiss or scratch. When I went fairly early in the morning, I was decently surprised to find all of them except for one awake and very excited and running all around the place. They're less interested by the toys and more amused by your presence and actions. If you pay some more money or donate some, if you can feed snacks to the cats and that definitely gets all of them to you.

In terms of menu options, they have a wide selection of drinks, but only a handful of them are $5 or more and they have some snacks for purchase as well. The time you get to spend in the cat room honestly seems to depend on the line-up at the point in time. On paper they have a 15-20 minute limit, but when they're no wait (e.g. when we went in the morning), we got to spend about 30-40 minutes in there. It's a cool cafe concept with decent drinks, but I probably won't be back that often."}
{"text":"I was so excited to hear that cat cafe opened up in Toronto and I was expecting a chill environment for people to have coffee like a regular cafe but with just cats. It was nothing like what I expected.. I was there for 30 seconds and walked out. The area with cats were separated from where people were waiting to go into the cat room. Inside the cat room, cats looked like they were annoyed by all the people who were trying to touch them and take pictures. Most of them looked like they were sitting higher places so they can avoid getting touched."}
{"text":"Toronto's first cat cafe! :D 
So much anticipation for this cafe - and it's great because the kitties are from the Toronto Humane Society for everyone to love. I got to play with Tiana the kitty cat the most, so adorable!

What to expect:
You have to sign in at the back of the store and wait your turn before entering the \"cat room\" to play with the kitties. Each session is 15 minutes. During the wait time, you can purchase a drink - the drink can also be brought into the cat room (although you'll be too busy playing with the cats, you'll neglect your drink). Prior to entering the cat room, you will be asked to switch from your outdoor shoes to cat slippers to maintain cleanliness.

* suggestion for owners: for the sign up sheet, I think the process would be better if people are assigned numbers instead of putting down our first names - it gets confusing and hard to hear during the wait for the cat room! :)"}
{"text":"It sounds like a great idea in concept, but watching people poke, blow on (?!?) and harass the cats is so upsetting. Stressing these poor animals with crowds of people ... Pass on on this circus and support your local cat shelter or humane society instead :( 
There isn't enough room in the dedicated cat room, and it's chaos. I feel terrible for these cats."}
{"text":"Fairly! I have been followed all the posts about cat cafe because my obsession with cats! 
TOT has good compromise between drinks and cats since Ontario has strict rules about the food hygiene. They have separate room has 5 meows meows inside. You should purchase the drink first(obvious) and then sign up to visit those little cutie in the room. It might take 20mins after you sign up,they have long list but process pretty quickly.
Answer for the TOT name, we asked the owner and he says it's the sound of his cat sound. I think it's so cute. Everyone will have fair time to visit, pet them but can't wake them up. I agree with it. All the cats from the recuse team and will be able to adopt anytime. One sad thing about this is most of them are black, i think some people are just so superstition.  Will come back for sure!"}
{"text":"I think there were a total of four cats in the cat room the evening my friends and I were there. And three of them were sleeping. Stupid lazy cats...don't you realize you're here for OUR entertainment? 

Haha, just kidding. 

I have two awesome playful cats at home, so I was a little underwhelmed with my visit at TOT. Don't get me wrong, the cats (more like kittens...I think I overheard one of the employees say they were all about 5 months old) were adorable, but 10 people chasing around one cat was kind of lame. Sleeping cats are super cute too...but you kind of get bored petting one after like, 2 minutes. 

I was a little taken aback with the attitude of one of the employees (the one with the big glasses). After she read us the cat room rules, I asked if we were allowed to bring our drinks in the cat room. She was all like, \"um, yeah, that's the whole point.\" Wtf? Thanks for making me feel like an idiot. I could have sworn I read somewhere previously that restaurants are not allowed to have beverages or food in the same vicinity as live animals. Another friend said \"thank you\" as we were leaving, and the same employee just ignored her and walked the other way.

My apple cider was okay, but next time I think I'll just save the $4 and play with my own kitties at home. I can poke or blow on them if they're sleeping and no one can say anything cause they're my cats :)"}
{"text":"It was my first time here and I went with a friend! Let me just first start off by saying, I love all animals. I don't care what it looks like or what it is, I love it all. 

I didn't know much about the history and story behind this place other than the fact that it's one of the only (or only?) pet Cafe in Toronto. More specifically, it's a cat cafe! Sorry, I don't know what Tot means and I didn't ask. I'll ask next time!

I went here with a friend and you have to order a drink in order to be placed in line to enter the room with cats. Most of the drinks are hot drinks. However, they do have cold sodas and juices as well. Both my friend and I both ordered the black cat mocha (one with whipped cream and one without. Although I only have a picture of the one without whipped cream because I started drinking mine before I took a picture hehe). They also have cheesecake and cookies and yogurt(?) but we didn't get any of those. We only got drinks this time. The drinks are also a little bit pricey! Around starbucks-ish prices? But it's okay because you also get to play with cats. 

The drink itself is delicious! It was really good (both with and without whipped cream). The cats were super adorable and fun to play with. I just wish they let us stay in there for a bit longer. 

I also heard that these cats are being saved from the humane society because according to law, the cats need to be placed in cages overnight at the humane society and I think this is the first place that overrides that law so that they don't need to be placed in cages? I'm not sure if that's completely correct since I heard the owner talk about this to someone else (the owner and everyone there we saw are super nice and friendly! Sorry... Forgot everyone's name. I'm not good with names). At Tot, they also put the cats up for adoption to the general public (they get a lot of applications for cat adoption!)."}
{"text":"Edit: To all the people who said the cafe is meant to enjoy coffee with cats and not to take selfies. From my experience there, people quickly discarded their drinks and/or cakes when they were called in, and everybody was holding up their phones and cameras to take pictures once they got into the cat room. 

Been really excited even since I saw the Facebook event saying there's a new cat cafe opening in Toronto. I RSVPed when the event only had about 100 people signed up to attend. I have been to a similar cat themed cafe in China so I had high expectations.

The Wait:
I came for the Nov 16th grand opening at around 6pm after work. I was expected to skip the line because I had RSVPed so ahead of time. I was disappointed when a long lineup greeted me when I got to the cafe and there were no staff around to talk to. The front door was locked so I couldn't even get into the cafe to tell them that I had RSVPed. Ended up waiting till 6:45pm to get into the door, but the lineup didn't end there. My group had to lineup to buy a coffee/drink, put our names down on a list, then wait for the staff to call us to come into the cat room. 
When I got to the cashier I tried to tell them that I had an RSVP and they didn't even check to see if I was on the google docs list. I was told that I had to wait like everybody else. Their poor communication and disorganization really pissed me off at the time. Don't create an RSVP list and create false hope for your customers if you're not even going to enforce the policy!!!

Coffee:
The quality of the drinks were poor, not tasty at all, the cups were small, and pretty pricy. I ordered a small latte and the presentation was just sad...I was shocked to find out that the cheesecakes were $6.25 per slice. Nobody comes to a cat cafe specifically for the food so I wasn't too fed up with the coffee. 

The Cat Room:
Ok so this is the highlight of the trip. My group was called into the cat room at around 7:15pm and we were given around 15-20mins to be in the room. The cat to human ratio was around 5:10, so you would always be fighting for the chance to take photos with the other people there. We weren't allowed to pick up the cats or disturb a sleeping cat. The most you could do was to gently pat them. Taking photos or selfies with the cats was very difficult since we were not allowed to pick them up. My group ended up leaving the cat room before our allotted time because there wasn't anything else to see.

Overall experience:
- poor organization and communication from the staff, waited for a long time like everybody else even though I was on the RSVP list
- low quality of coffee, tea, and food, prices were on the higher end
- 5:10 cat to human ratio, difficult to take pictures with the cats

I wish the cat cafe is better organized in the future, because this is cool themed cafe and I like that Toronto can finally have its own cat cafe. Not sure if I'll ever be back, TOT just doesn't have the same magic that I experienced elsewhere."}
{"text":"If you like cats like I do then you will love this place. You buy your beverage and then sign up to go visit the kitties which are located in a separate room. There is apparently a 20 minute limit when visiting the kitties but they don't really time you so you could probably stay a bit longer if you wanted. All the cats can be adopted so there are always different kitties to play with if you become a regular here. Before entering the kitty room you have to change into slippers which are provided for you.

As for the drinks the we got cappuccino and a mocha which were both really well done. If there were no cats here I would still come here just for the drinks. We also got a butter tart which was okay as a snack.  

Can't wait to come back again."}
{"text":"I've been to nearly 20 cat cafes throughout the world.  This is my least favorite one to date, primarily because it seems designed to cause maximum stress to the cats.

Many cats don't like environments with a lot of change, with people coming and going, and with no place to hide, the cats seemed pretty stressed out -- actually shaking.  Some of the others were happily sleeping up on shelves.

At every other cat cafe I've visited, there is a pass through from the people room into a restricted cat room (where their food and litter boxes are).

The cafe also has an \"interesting\" minimum spend policy. Most of the drinks are just under $5.  If you spend less than $5, you have to donate $5 (i.e. a fee); if you have 2 people buying 2 drinks which add up to over $10, you also need to donate.  I have no problem if they want to charge a fee, but this isn't disclosed very well in advance."}
{"text":"First time coming to a cat cafe in T.O and thought the place would be a lot bigger than I had in mind. Was quite disappointed to find out that only a small section of the unit was used for playing with the cats and the other section was used as a large cafe... Admission is not really cheap either. You have to pay $5 for admission ON TOP you need to purchase a beverage or food item as well. So the total cost of going into a room to play with cats (and no guarantee that the cats will play with you back or be active) will come up to over $20 for 2 people...  Good thing thing they don't charge you on time because that would be even worse... However even so, the space where they contain the cats is so small and you pretty much can be done in a couple of minutes. 

Unfortunately for me, the time I went the cats were not active and most of them were sleeping so it was pretty boring looking at cats sleep and not wanting to play with you. One cat scratched me and I started bleeding so that was not a cool cat ( no pun intended). After a bit of time, the excitement of playing with cats is out the window and really boring... You can only take so many photos of 'sleeping cats' and pet so many.. You literally can be there for 15 mins and gone... 

Overall, not really that fun due to semi- expensive admission fee and going to play with boring and some potentially crazy cats in a small space."}
{"text":"Located on college st near china town. This place is quite small and in order to do check the cats it you must purchase $5.00 of drinks or $10 donation. The wait time varies if it's busy. It's okay to to check it out. But there's not too many cats and it's really different that the Cafe in Asia if you've experienced it before."}
{"text":"Since it IS TOT's grand opening, I will probably update this review when the staff get the hang of things and the hype goes down a bit. For now, you probably shouldn't rush over to this (admittedly adorable) cafe for the kitties. 

I booked reservations for their grand opening (Nov 16) a few days ahead of time. When my boyfriend and I arrived, the lineup stretched across the cafe and apparently the wait time was close to 1 hour. When I informed the staff about my reservation, they apologized profusely and said that the organizers messed up, so they didn't receive any reservations. However they allowed us inside after waiting for 10 minutes. 

So the cat room is separate from the cafe itself! We brought our drinks inside, sanitized our hands, and took off our shoes. The coffee is really average, but the requirement is to purchase a drink in order to play with the kitties. I actually threw my drink away quite quickly because the kitties dipped their paws in the liquid! At the time there were 5 kitties either sleeping, avoiding contact with humans, or angrily chasing after feathers. We had a time limit of playing inside the room for 30 minutes, but the staff forgot to kick my boyfriend and I out so we actually played close to an hour, which is great! 

You can adopt the kittens you liked afterwards, but I don't really know the process. Come by for the novelty of hanging out with cats, but don't have high hopes for the drinks themselves. Also, you might have to wait for a long time!"}
{"text":"Meow.  Came here for the private opening on the weekend and met lots of adorable kitties.  We stayed for an hour and played with the few cats that were awake, since most were sleepy from frolicking the night before.  There were 5-6 cats in total, and you get props to play with them in the cat room.  Also got free tea/coffee with desserts during the opening, which was nice :) Only drawback imo is that it's not exactly a cats cafe since the cafe area is separated from the cat room and you don't get kitties roaming around in the actual cafe.  There's also a limited number of people allowed in the room with a limited visiting time.  Overall, very cute idea and the first of its kind in this city :)"}
{"text":"Came today with friends and there weren't many people. There were two groups inside the cat area and no one else in the cafe area.

I remember reading on Yelp that you just need to purchase a drink to be able to go inside the cat room, but not anymore. We each had to buy a drink AND pay a $5 fee to be in that room - I hope all the proceeds go back into the cats.

It was around 3pm when we visited, and the cats were all sleepy. We couldn't really play with them because we couldn't wake them up, and those that were awake we're still very sleepy - also cranky because of the humans disturbing their sleeping time! Although I felt cheated out of my money, I felt worse for the cats who had to deal with noisy people coming in and out of the room (and even outside of the room since the glass windows aren't soundproof). On top of the noise, the cat area looked messy and as if it hadn't been cleaned very well. There were also air conditioners or something at one side and I thought it was very strange how there wasn't anything closing it off to the cats. I saw one cat sleeping in the corner surrounded by the machines and even one by the outlet! Very dangerous.

The cat cafe has potential, but it can really use some improvement. It needs to be more considerate towards the cats and think about the service being offered to the visitors (e.g. Giving the cats a break from humans in the afternoon). I don't think I'll be coming back here; volunteering at a cat adoption centre is more worth it than visiting this cat cafe."}
{"text":"I've been to this location a few times but unfortunately this will be the last time. If it weren't for the staff working hard at the cafe itself and being so friendly, I would leave a much lower rating.

The first three times I've been here, it was clean, cat's looked healthy and clean, food was what I expected, room was well heated and everyone seemed to be respectful to the animals.

This time as soon as you opened to door to the cat room, my eyes were burning. All of the litter boxes were full, and I actually cut my time short in there because of how gross the floor, seating and smell was. Cleaning products were left out on the floor, although not opened, they had rags around them that I'm assuming they use with said products.

Other than the handful of kittens they got that morning/recently, the others felt dirty, looked dirty and NONE of them wanted to be touched. Like actively ran pasted everyone in the room and seemed stressed. They only came out once treats were introduced, and even with the treats, they would bend and move out of the way of any hands offering to let them sniff them or pet. I felt guilty being in there because they did not seem like they were too thrilled about me. Previously I had cats crawling all over me (both with and without treats) and even if they seemed anti social, they were still friendly enough. I know cats all have bold personalities (I'm a cat owner myself) but it seemed as though they all wanted to hide or avoid humans. Also the older cats seemed very lethargic and over weight, no interest in toys or anything, really.

I seriously cannot express how uncomfortable I was in that room. This is from someone who has been there multiple times, seen numerous cats there and owns pets.

I'm very disappointed, but I feel as though this place is low staffed and has too many things to maintain for that size of staff.

I'd like to see this place improve and maybe check it back out later. I think it would help if they stopped letting people adopt the cats, and just adopt them themselves so they can have cats who live there and are used to this sort of thing. Also maybe less people in the room at a time and/or less cats? I know that seems wild of me to say as a cat lover but either clean those boxes and spray the room or have less cats. I felt that no matter where I was there was a litter box beside me."}
{"text":"3.5/5 (for the experience). 

*For the food/drink menu, there were many selections of drink to choose from but most were the typical ones that you would get at any other cafes, and there wasn't a lot of choices for food. The prices were reasonable as well and note that the drinks that you paid is also the entrance fee to the cat room.

*Black Cat Mocha - $4
I ordered the Black Cat Mocha and I can't remember what kind of syrup they used, but I remember it was alright! The drinks also took quite some time to arrive since there was only one barista working.

*House rules: 
-Before entering the room, we were advised to take off our shoes and disinfect our hands with sanitizer.
-I just want to put this out there, I don't understand why people are complaining about the rules. Don't get me wrong, I would love to pick up the cats and play with them, but these rules are also being enforced in the cafes in Asia as well. At the same time, not all cats like it when strangers pick them up and they might injure you if you do so.

*the cat room is secluded from the cafe itself and customers are allowed to bring drinks/food into the room. There were around 5 cats for 8 people and we were in there for 15-20 minutes. Since we came quite late, most cats were tired out from all the activities during the day and they went to sleep instead. At the same time, due to the odd cat to human ratio, even if the cats were awake, I think we would always be fighting for the chance to play with them.

I supposed since the cafe wasn't like the ones in Asia where you can actually work and stay however long you want, we eventually got bored since there wasn't anything else to do. So really, if you pay $5 to \"watch\" some sleeping cats for 15 - 20 minutes, that's not worth it at all. Most of these cats were black cats which are considered as \"bad luck\" in some cultures and often get abandoned, so I LOVE the owner's dedications to help these cats go into their forever home.

There should have been more cats and it would have been better if the secluded room was bigger as well. I say go visit for the novelty, but don't expect to walk in there and have thousand of cats surround you, unless they were awake and wanted you to rub their bellies.. for a few minutes."}
{"text":"Kitty bar. So much fun having a coffee and hanging out with cats. Definitely worth a visit. I'm not a huge cat lover, but enjoyed my time here. A different experience to say the least.

Tip: You can ask for treats for the cats and make a small donation in exchange ($2)"}
{"text":"Takes forever to get into the cat room, there is only two cats the coffee is watery, the white chocolate is bleh."}
{"text":"If you're a Cat Lover, I highly recommend that you visit this place.  The Staff are super friendly, and the Prices are Reasonable.  The Kitties here are also up for adoption.  I just found recently that, they're not affiliated with the Government Animal shelter, and that they're a non profit organization.  Please come by and support them."}
{"text":"The carpets are a little worn out & there's cat hair everywhere in the cat room. But I guess that's to be expected with about 6 cats staying there. I do hope the owner of the Cat Cafe takes time to clean at least once a day. The cats in here were cute & some were friendly, others kept their distance. There were plenty of litter boxes around & the food/water was in a central location away from the litter boxes. There were also lots of toys & cat trees for the cats to climb on or hide in or under. The big window on one side allows them to get some natural light. There was a fan or air filter off to one side in the cat room. Some of the cats looked like they might have eye infections. A little black kitten we saw in there seemed too skinny to me. But in general the cats looked relaxed & happy. I do hope a vet comes to check the cats periodically. The adoption poster of cats that had been adopted in the past was nice to see. Seems a lot of cats had been adopted because of this place.

There is a minimum purchase at the cafe to get into the cat room. Makes sense as that is how they make enough money to take care of the cats I suppose. You can either eat your food outside the cat room or take it in. Just follow the rules they have posted. No human food for the cats is one of them. No outside shoes another rule. I like the idea that the cafe supports local cat rescues & even local artists. There is cat themed art hanging on the walls of the cafe (outside the cat room) & some of them are really amazing. 

The bathroom was clean but the faucet was broken. Very important to have working bathroom fixtures. People will be washing their hands often in this establishment. At least they should be! Other than that I liked this place. The food we got as a snack (chocolate muffin) was okay. Nothing spectacular. Water was my only drink so I cannot comment on the specialty drinks they have. The guy running the cash was very friendly & nice. The place looks a little shabby but its to be expected as this is Kensington Market. I would come back again next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Toronto's first cat cafe, TOT the Cat Cafe, opened in Kensington Market this November. I've been to one of Montreal's cat cafes this past summer and wanted to compare.

I was slightly bummed out with my trip here. My first disappointment was the cost of my Masala Chai. It was $2.25, which I found was overpriced for a teabag in hot water. The menu itself was pretty standard and at the time I was there (in November), their food menu was limited. I was told that they are planning to bring in more food so that might have changed by now.

The cafe has a separate room for customers to go in and view the cats because of regulations. Everyone that enters the room has to wear a pair of cute cat slippers in order to keep the room clean. It is small and compact with various cat furniture for the cats to climb and sleep on. In order to get into the cat room, you must register yourself onto a waiting list. The length of time you are allowed to stay in the cat room varies on how busy the cafe is. This can get a bit frustrating when the cafe gets really busy and there is a huge wait list.

They had eight cats during the time I was there and one got adopted that very day! The process of the adoption takes awhile because hopeful owner(s) would have to meet with the shelter for interviews and processing paperwork. The cats were definitely adorable and I think this would be a great place for any cat lover.

I was mainly disappointed with my experience because of my order and how the cats weren't allowed to roam free due to regulations. I saw that people could get annoyed waiting to get in when there was a huge line-up. I hope that the menu have improved since I was last there because I felt that they could have added more to the experience."}
{"text":"This Toronto cat cafe pales in comparison to the cafes in Japan, China, Korea, and even Europe. Even though I understand that the city has strict health and safety regulations, I think the owners could have done a much better job with it. The place itself is very cramped and it seems more of a prison for the cats than it is a cozy home. They had four cats (maybe it was five?) when I went and all of them are quite different in their personalities. There was also a long line up when me and my friend went on a Sunday afternoon so plan accordingly if you want to go. Also, you're only given fifteen minutes in the cat room as there is a line up."}
{"text":"Definitely was in need of some relaxing and lighthearted fun with cats today so I decided to try out this place. Very cute cafe with delicious cappuccinos! It is either a drink purchase + $5, or simply  $10 for admission into the cafe for one hour. I really enjoyed my time here and felt more relaxed compared to when I came in.

I completely support the cafes efforts toward helping sick cats and making the cats available to adopt. The cats are treated very well here, and I definitely appreciated that.

The cafe itself has certainly seen better days, it has received a lot of love from customers and could use a paint job and some touch ups here and there, as well as more regular bathroom servicing, but overall the cafe is clean and my time here was relaxing. It's a very cozy cafe with tons of cute kitties waiting patiently to be adopted. Thanks for a great afternoon!"}
{"text":"AMAZINGLY slow service, even with few people in the shop. However, you come here for the cats right? Very cute. You may have to wait a bit to play with them, but ... it's cats. They're always worth waiting for."}
{"text":"Wish I could give this place a lower rating. Extremely rude staff and spoke to my family in a very condescending tone and expected us to know the process. Save yourself a trip and don't waste your time giving this place even a cent."}
{"text":"I was so excited to check out Toronto's first cat cafe and I'm just extremely disappointed. 

First off, a purchase is mandatory to step inside the cat room which is reasonable. However, the barista/cashier was extremely rude about explaining this to the couple in front of me. My friend needed a bit more time to order so I went ahead and the barista/cashier asked if I had a friend and I explained that she wasn't ready, then the barista/cashier pretty much demanded my friend order right away so we could be listed together. She had such a negative attitude, had I not already paid I would have walked right out.

Second, as per fellow reviewers, the human to cat ratio is stupid. There were 3 kittens when we were let in, and about 8 people. To be fair, I think there were supposed to be 5 but maybe the other 2 got adopted and around 5pm there are a crazy amount of people coming in and waiting. The kittens were trying to sleep and everyone was hovering over them, poking or petting them, and shoving phones in their faces to take videos or pictures. I understand you want to record the moment, but be considerate of the cat and fellow viewers. The last thing I or the cat want to see is a phone obstructing our vision. 

Also, they are kittens. I know the cats are from the THS and they have many older cats that need homes. The kittens in the shop were only from 2 to 5 months old making me wonder if they are being selective with the cats being displayed.

I don't think I will be coming back here. It's a great idea that has worked well in other cases, but I don't think this is up to the standards of an actual cat cafe."}
{"text":"Adorable cats and good coffee at reasonable prices.  Really nice staff.  Show up early though, as the lines after us were long."}
{"text":"ALWAYS ask for a receipt, even if you paid in cash.

I waited a good 30 minutes at the café (with my drink) until I realized they had to get your name down before you could go into the cat room. Neither of the staff (there were two of them at the time) told me about it, and they even had the decency to \"forget\" having served me. One of them had black hair, who handled the cash, and the other blonde, who made the drink. BOTH of them served me, but neither remembered having done so. Ridiculous. They also gave me attitude about it which I found rude and disrespectful; I was a customer, for crying out loud. 

Other than that awful mishap, I got to stay in the cat room for 30 minutes. It was around 1-2PM if I remember correctly, so the cats must have been tired from their morning playtime (most of them were asleep). The place isn't too spacious and could get pretty cramped during busy hours, especially after noon.

I don't want to recommend this place but it's the only cat café in Toronto, so if you love cats and you've never been, it wouldn't hurt to go once. Prices are like any other café. I like that you could apply for adoption as they are partnered with the Humane Society, but I personally don't think I'll come back."}
{"text":"Really fun concept, and a great way to spend time with cats. All of the animals are adoptable for $150. Its nice you can get to know the animals before taking one home. Unfortunately the wait time is about 45 minutes and although you can have coffee while you wait, the coffee isn't very good. The location is understaffed as well. When i was there one employee was working and rushing to serve coffee as well as operating the cat enclosure."}
{"text":"I was very excited to go to the cafe but unfortunately it was a slight letdown. It's not really the establishments fault but the experience wasn't great. 

There is an entrance fee of a food or drink from the menu. It was mediocre but I wasn't expecting much and the prices were reasonable considering overhead costs (I paid about $3). The interior is pretty decent since they are in a not so clean/run down area of town. I really like how the window let's in some natural light in the cat room. 

Honestly the biggest letdown were the cats! They were all sleeping but very cute. We are not allowed to wake them up which is understandable. There were 4 humans in the cat room and 3 cats. People kept leaving and coming in because once the initial excitement wears off there's nothing else to do except sit... And watch sleeping cats. I wish there were more cats but the area is very small and it would be cramped if there were more than 8 people. 

All in all, the whole experience, similar to a zoo, depends on how the cats are during the time of day you come. We were unlucky but I didn't have a horrible time or anything. 3/5"}
{"text":"Visited the cat cafe on a Saturday morning around 11am when it opened. There was already a short waiting list so my bf and I ordered drinks and put our names down on the list. Ordered a matcha latte and an earl grey tea, nothing special for both but decent. We waited for about 15 mins to go into the cat room.

Once in the cat room, we were lucky and spent about 30 mins in the room as there was not as many people that morning. Some cats were sleeping since they were tired from the previous visitors. It was a nice experience to pet the cute cats and play with them :) 

Unfortunately you cannot compare the cafe to the cat cafe in Montreal though. Of course due to the different bylaws of the city, the setup is different. Would likely go back to pet the cats though! Very cute!"}
