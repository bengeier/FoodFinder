{"text":"I believe there were two locations.  There was another location in Madison other than the one just off State and the family moved down to Lake Geneva and opened one up there.  I'm not sure what happened to Temple Gardens off State though, I do know that the families that owned both places were related.

I seriously miss their tea eggs!!"}
{"text":"Hello Madison!  (and Alison)

My parents are kicking back in Key Largo now and we have not reopened another restaurant... I have so many fond memories of the city.. 

Looking forward to coming back to visit one day..."}
{"text":"Can someone please tell me what happened to Temple Garden?  This was the best chinese food in Madison!  Nothing was better than anything on the menu with their noodles.

I've heard more than once that after they moved from the Gilman st location that they opened up elsewhere under a different name.  Seriously, these noodles haunt me!"}
