{"text":"I lived nearby, and Chubby's is a Friday night staple for us. Their fish and chips are their showcase (halibut is best). The souvlaki, burgers (especially the t-rex), and steak on a Kaiser are great."}
{"text":"This is a legendary place  in the local neighborhood, McDonalds is across the street and this place blows it out the water. Fries come on plates, burgers are always on point. Fish and chips or salads are excellent too."}
{"text":"Love this place! Good food, good prices, and the staff is super friendly. I live pretty far but it's worth the drive. Their fish and chips are top shelf. A Rexdale gem"}
{"text":"If you want to eat in forget it there's no air conditioning..you'll sweat like a pig; food is greasy decor is retro 50's washrooms forget it... Just another greasy spoon!"}
{"text":"The food is great the staff is always friendly! The fish and chips are a bit pricey but you do get a large portion."}
{"text":"Second time going there and it was amazing! Service was excellent and the gentleman who helped me was so friendly. I loved that the food is cooked in front of you. Cash only"}
{"text":"Best fish and chips place in the neighborhood bar none. The only complaint is that the halibut sandwich is so big I can never finish the whole thing! Portions are huge but well worth the money."}
{"text":"This place was amazing!!!! The most exceptional service from all staff from the moment we stepped foot in the door to the moment we left! French fries and Greek salad were 100% on point and the haddock was good too! Only negative take away was the prepackaged tartar sauce which wasn't anything to write home about."}
{"text":"Good haddock and fries. Glad I found this place. Will definitely return if I'm craving for fish and chip near home."}
{"text":"one of the best places in rexdale. Food quality is good, hospitality is great"}
{"text":"I've never been disappointed at Chubby's. The staff is always so friendly, service is speedy fast, and the fish is fried in a crispy and light batter that is irresistible. Strongly recommend!"}
{"text":"I had passed this place several times. Eventually tried it out.  Oh boy. Bring your sweat pants and your appetite.  The portions are huge!!! The fries are brilliant. The gravy is pretty good too. I tried the haddock which was ok...I am spoiled when it comes to fish and chips as I grew up in a coastal town in scotland. So in the words of Sinead O'Connor nothing compares (to fish caught and eaten the same day).  That said Chubby ' s does a damn good job.   Burgers are huge and everything is cooked to order.nd  No heat lamps!   Worth a visit."}
{"text":"This is THE WORST fish and chips place! Trust me, the oil they use is extremely old and a few seconds of the fish in the fryer will burn them black. We received super hard dark flavorless pieces of haddock and halibut and the fries are soggy and tasteless. They don't know what good fish and chips are... Go anywhere but here!!!!! Never again!"}
{"text":"I have Been going to this restaurant for quite a while and I always go for the same which is the fish and chips. Good customer service always so friendly."}
{"text":"So a friend of mine asked me a while back if I wanted to have a good burger.  So I started naming amazing burger places.  He said NO NO I am bringing you to Chubby's.  I had no idea what he was talking about nor had I ever heard about this place.  We pulled up and I have to say I was not too impressed and was kind of on edge about going eating there.  Wow how that all changed.  I ordered a simple banquet burger with a poutine.  Kind of a simple order.  As I waited for my burger I looked around to see what others were eating which I tend to do when im out at restaurants lol.  In my head I was like WOW portions are huge.  After a short wait I received my burger and poutine and have to say OMG it was hugeeee.  The amount of fries was also insane.  That dosent always mean it taste's great.  Until the first bite, juicy, tasty, fresh and super messy which we all know the messier the burger the better it is.  I was very impressed it was a great experience.  Unfortunately its kind of out of my way but let me tell you the next time I drive by hungry or not im going in."}
{"text":"Decent fish n chips. Good price. My fish haddock was a bit too deep fried for my taste. More then enough fries. Would eat here again, prices were decent."}
{"text":"Friday June 19/15. 1pm. On the advice of reviews I find myself at the ordering counter of Chubby's Fish and Chips.  About the interior of the restaurant. It was dated. Had a cool side counter with small stools and the rest of the place had old tables and chairs. I chose to sit at a table. Something bout the ripped vinyl plushy chair cushions. The interior was clean and smelled stank free. The resto has pictures of the popular items taped to the ordering counter. I liked the visual.  Well, I ain't here the for the fish people, I came for the T-Rex Banquet Burger and Chips with Gravy and Cheese aka Poutine. Now as you can tell by the pics I took, this is one big burger. Four thick slices of Back Bacon on top of a Beef Patty fully loaded w/ cheese. I could hardly fit my mouth around this monstrosity so I attacked from several different angles. Lol. Just the Back Bacon alone made this a worthy sandwich. The SOC who put this beast together did so with thoughtful skill. He sandwiched the cheese in between the Bacon and laid it atop the burger patty. The LTO and Pickles were underneath the patty. Well thought out.  Eating the beast got really messy but surprisingly stayed mostly intact. Now keep in mind that with all that  Back Bacon this is one sodium rich burger.  My one disappointment was the patty. Was it there?  I couldn't taste it under all that porky goodness. They should amp up the burger to either a double patty or just a bigger patty.  Verdict: Salright.  I found that the Faux Poutine wasn't all that bad either.   Crispy fried potato sticks covered in sodium enriched gravy. My goodness!  I gobbled up every last fry.   No debit or credit here folks. Ceeyash only!  Kudos to the friendly staff. I don't think I am done here just yet. I am gonna give the Homeburger a whirl one day.  Peace my fellow Yelpers."}
{"text":"An old standby. My family and I have been patrons here almost 40 years! The best banquet burger I've ever had is here. Halibut fish n chips is always good here. The service seems to be attentive and reliable."}
{"text":"The food was good and the staff was friendly but there seemed to be some confusion when we were placing our order to the extent that we weren't really sure exactly what we ended up ordering until it arrived.  Aside from that little oddity, the food was very good and the portions fairly generous."}
{"text":"Where do I start? Always perfect fish 'n chips for over 30 years. Never had anything else from the menu until now. T Rex Banquet Burger!!  Based on the tradition of a regular Banquet burger, the T Rex is big. Really big. Layered ingredients keep the burger together. No slippage or shifting. A little mustard/mayo/relish lubricant leakage but its expected. Felt massive in hand. Be prepared to not finish."}
{"text":"Wow, the portions here are huge. As for the place it's dated which is okay but the table we say at was not cleaned. The taste of the burger was average and did enjoy the fries.  The customer service was very prompt and friendly."}
{"text":"These folks were super nice.  The portion size was also massive.  I'm pretty sure I paid about $13 including tax for fish and chips.  That's super good pricing.  Also, they don't give you a hard time about tartar sauce or charge per packet or anything like that.  It's nice to enjoy your fish and chips the way you want.  The food was tasty.  But it's hard to go wrong.  It's deep fried fish with a side of deep fried fries..."}
{"text":"One of the best fish n chips place I've found so far. Although the price is a bit steep, it's definitely worth it if you have a craving for fish n chips. I ended up paying $20 for halibut, poutine and a pop. The portions of the fish and poutine were huge! I'm surprised I was able to finish everything (I had a serious craving I tell ya). I'm definitely coming back to try the burgers and get more fish."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this restaurant, they have been here for years since I was a kid I've been going here and nothing has changed with the food. If your craving a great fish n chips or even a burger get the t-Rex burger it's amazing, this place is cash only btw so make sure you have cash !"}
{"text":"Old fashioned diner-style, good value for money, prices are in line with other joints but portions are HUGE!  Clean, no fishy or dank smell.  Friendly banter from staff, quick take-out.  Cash only!  An Etobicoke icon, has been in this strip mall on Islington north FOREVER!  We can never finish all the fries."}
