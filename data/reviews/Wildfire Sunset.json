{"text":"Wildfire makes a great BBQ bacon burger and it's only $7.99.  They also serve breakfast 24 hours a day, which is what our kids usually get.  It's just good food at at a great price, nothing is over $10 and most items are $7-8.  One of our family's favorite places for a quick bite."}
{"text":"The bartenders are all awesome I especially like Aysha on grave and Cassandra on swing there my favorites"}
{"text":"I went to this place to have a burger one night and I loved it. I had the classic burger (without the coleslaw) and fries. If you don't mind this small place located inside a smoke-filled small casino, you should definitely try the burger and fries."}
{"text":"Went there for the first time. It is a strange way that they do things... you walk up to a hostess stand, you have to order and pay before being seated. We ordered the fish n chips and a burger with fries. The fish n chips were decent. The burger was made wrong. They did correct it though and made another. Not busy at all and it was Saturday evening about 6pm. So not doing well, business wise. It was Monday and they said we got a senior discount due to the day of the week."}
{"text":"i give this establishment 1 star because the service was good HOWEVER, there was an off duty cop at the bar provoking a person of color for no apparent reason. He kept asking him questions and staring him down, the bar tenders on duty were Cassandra and Tiffany on 1-4-2016 at 11:30 p.m. I was very uncomfortable so I left, that was my first time and will be my last time going there."}
{"text":"The GF got a Wildfire burger groupon of the internet.  We decided to do a cheap date night and went out exploring.  Parking at Wildfire Sunset was not a problem.  Upon making entry is easy to tell the joint was filled with casual Henderson locals.   We made out way to the dining room and found it closed.  Fearing the worst, we were told to sit anywhere and we would be taken care of.  We decided to sit in the sports book and enjoy our greasy treats.  The menu presented all kinds of options for building your burger.  I found the ingredients to be tasty and fresh. The close proximity to bar made for quick, cool and tasty beverages which eventually  complement the meal. The groupons $10 for $20 made for a very pleasant meal and date night."}
{"text":"It's good, not great, but I really did enjoy the food that was on my plate.    Angus Beef burger with Brioche bun and a fried egg added just for fun.  Food portion wise plenty,  Value wise not spendy, Ambiance. ..definitely not trendy.  The smoky air is so not good for you But that $2 hot fudge sundae is food for you!  So give it a try, you know with a place that's clean and gets grade A's you won't die!   But seriously the burgers did not disappoint,  staff is easy going and friendly. Casual style diner. Order and pay first before you get a table. Wild Grill is located in the center of Wildfire Casino."}
{"text":"Food is awesome, staff friendly . John is fantastic . Go see him and get the wild burger !"}
{"text":"4 stars for what it is, a divy little diner in a divy little casino.  I like that it is located by one of the entrances, so it's easy to get into without having to walk all through out the casino.  I've eaten here a handful of times over the years, and I must say I have always gotten good service.  When I was still an omnivore- I used to have the beer and burger special which included a PBR, all for seven dollars.  Since becoming vegan, I have always found that they are willing to accommodate my request. On my last visit they made me hashbrowns with saut√©ed veggies, and they cooked it in oil instead of butter. I got a large portion of food and it was really good! And less expensive than other breakfast joints nearby. Ordered a Bloody Mary from the bar, it was good and only $5! Also, I like that they have TVs in here and we can watch whatever game is on.  So while this isn't a four star establishment, it IS a four star for what it is, a cool little hole in the wall place to eat."}
{"text":"No complaint on the burgers.........however..........when is it appropriate for management to allow a screaming toddler to control the environment while the customer are playing or trying to enjoy their lunch while the parent keep stuffing their fat asses.  The manager never came to our table at our request.     How dumb can you really be?   We were weekly customer.    That will stop completely.   Let the baby and the red neck parents pay your bills."}
{"text":"Burger was really good. Fresh ingredients fries are ok. The patty was cooked perfectly.  My only complaint even though the bun was toasted it still ended up a dough ball for the last 4 bites.  If the cook would only allow 2 minutes resting time before placing it on the bun! Its the difference between 3 stars and 4 stars. The service was ok we went on a Sunday around 3 for a late lunch.... I can only imagine how Smokey it gets on a sat night....... they need to fully enclose the restaurant."}
{"text":"In and Out across the street?? Psshh Wildfire not only has exquisite burgers but a quality hometown atmosphere you would expect to find at  \"mom and pop joint\". While the burger may be a 7 the, costumer service always exceeds expectations.  I cant speak for the rest of the staff but the cashiers/cooks at the Wildfire are the cream of the crop and one of the reasons I don't mind skipping a similar burger across the street. Try the foot-long hot dog just make sure you don't have anything important the next day... oh the deep-fried Twinkies there always a go-to."}
{"text":"I had the best Philly Cheesesteak sandwich I've ever had at the Wildfire Sunset today. Service was great--super fast and the waiter was so attentive. My husband had a clubhouse sandwich with great reviews too. I loved the sweet potato fries too. We've eaten there before--every time it's been really, really good. I highly recommend going there-- we felt very welcomed and appreciated, the food was excellent, and it was super fast and sooooooo good. Great staff!!"}
{"text":"We used to go to the former Gold Rush, which is now the Wildfire, and when we were back in the old neighborhood, we thought we would check out the new place.  Stopped by the coffee shop, ordered a couple of burgers with fries, paid when we ordered, and waited a short time for our food.  Our server, Trey, couldn't have been more professional if he had worked at some high end restaurant.  We left a $5 dollar tip on our $10 meal for the two of us.  Honestly, it is worth going out of your way to get an inexpensive breakfast, lunch, dinner or late night snack here!"}
{"text":"Wandered into this casino during a recent trip to Vegas.  It's a very small, locals casino.  A nice variety of Video Poker and Slots to choose from.  Everyone seemed to know each other.  The food here is average.  I had a Burger and Fries.  The parking lot was full of cars, so it must be a very popular place.  That's kind of strange because the much larger Sunset Station is next door.  Return Factor - 50%"}
{"text":"Came here to eat their classic burger that are o-so tasty but was disappointed.  Small location but it was closer to home than the other Wildfire location. I will not eat here again. I will definitely go to other Wildfire locations, just never again this one.  Customer service was overall pretty friendly but the cashier didn't ask us about their specials or anything like that. The person that cleans the tables asked us if everything was ok and I said not really. I explained that my burger was burnt and I asked for medium. She then explained to me that the fire on the grill gets really hot and can burn the hamburger. She apologized to me but didn't offer to make me another burger. My burger was not even hot when it came out which led me to believe that it might have been sitting in a holding bin and put back on the grill to warm it up but instead it burnt it to a crisp.  Not too many tables to sit in.  On the upside, their iced tea is delicious!"}
{"text":"Management doesn't even acknowledge your existence in this place.  Their lack of personality and concern for customer service is truly sad.  I'm calling it quits, once again with this place."}
{"text":"The staff and management are always friendly and professional. If you are looking for a neighborhood bar this would be the place. It's always clean. The wings are wonderful."}
{"text":"Whenever my friends and I drive to Arizona on the 95, we drive past a road that leads to a town called Chemehuevi. The town is 17 miles from the main road so it would be quite a detour to drive there and back to check it out. We always joke that someday we'll visit Chemehuevi but we know we never will.   Wildfire has been one of my Chemehuevis for awhile... I'd always wanted to go but never found the time. Never, that is, until tonight.   I wish I left the Wildfire to my imagination instead of ruining the mystique. All I got from my visit to the Wildfire was another shitty customer service experience at a Station Casino.   I used to wait tables in college and I know a thing or two about basic customer service... Greet the customer within the first, ohhhh, eight minutes or so right? I sat down at the bar, the blonde-haired barkeep sees me, then proceeds to continue with her side work until I leave the establishment. A similar thing happened with Josefina at Fiesta Rancho yesterday...    What does a guy have to do in Vegas to get a drink?  Someday I'll make it to Chemehuevi but I know I will never go back to the Wildfire."}
{"text":"I've been to another location of Wild Burger, and this one was mostly on par with what I'd experienced previously.  My burger was large, and fell apart.  I didn't get a ton of toppings, only blue cheese and bacon with the traditional burger veggies.  I guess the juiciness from the burger (which is great, don't get me wrong) compromised the integrity of the bun.  So, I again had to finish with a fork, and it became quite a mess.  But, it was cooked properly and tasted good.   My wife got the chili, which was very good.  Good chili flavor, and they serve it in a cast iron bowl.  This kept it hot throughout the entire lunch.  It was a nice touch, it really remained hot right up until the end of the meal.    Their secret sauce is basically thousand island with jalapenos added, then blended until smooth.  It's good on both the burger and your fries.    Onion strings are a solid version of this dish.  Fried onions are a welcome addition to any meal for me.  The service was fantastic, everyone was friendly, and the place was clean.  We'll return for sure."}
{"text":"Black guy with 1985 hi top fade always working sportsbook is miserable jerk. Stopped going here cause of him would rather make the walk into Sunset Station or any William Hill."}
{"text":"If you are a man, then go here. Because the service was great for men. Women are second best for the female bartenders.  I even ate here which was so-so.  I had a classic cheeseburger with bacon and provolone cheese. It was good. Wildfires are not all connected so my winning ticket from another location didn't work. This place is basic. Would I go back, maybe if I were drunk or bored."}
{"text":"Machines are very very tight. Food is good tho. I live nearby and us and other couples liked going here until we got tired of the machines draining us so quickly."}
{"text":"After a busy weekend of having family in town for a funeral I deceided to take 9 women to your bar because I have been there before and the ladies wanted to unwind a little. My cousin was asked how's it going by your bartender \"Casandra\" . As I walked in she said,\"well there's your problem\" after my cousin said hi to me. How much more RUDE could she be and in front of my family !!  I will NEVER step foot in your business again and will never tell anyone to go there. Your nasty bartender has to keep her nasty comments to her nasty self!!"}
