{"text":"Here with a group of 10 and they were accommodating. The bill came out to be 800 approx including taxes and tips which is reasonable for the amount of delicious live seafood! Dishes were a bit on the oily side but on par with fisherman."}
{"text":"Highly recommended.  Lobster was $ 16. 99 per pound.  I tried to order individual dishes, but  they calculated the bill then advised me to do combo instead because it saved me about $20.  Very good customer service."}
{"text":"This is one of the restaurants my friend highly recommended recently. About two weeks ago, me and a group of friends totally 5 finally came here for a lunch. We ordered one of my favorite foods - Lobster... The chef cooked it in 2 ways and both the dishes came out unbelievably so yummy.. Like the display, smell and texture. Besides, we also ordered other food like spicy clam, chicken and veggie and they all were cooked and served so good that you won't feel disappointed. Will definitely come back..."}
{"text":"Don't go there! Not sure about the food. The place seemed dirty. We were a party of 7 with 2 kids! The lady there was so pushy, convinced us to the dinner package with 10lb lobster which I knew was too much already. She comes out with a 11 lb lobsters and tell us you have to pay the difference. 11 lb for 5 adults and 2 kids are you kidding!!!!! I felt like I was at a timeshare presentation for god sakes!!!!!!!!!! Just wanted to have a nice meal with my family!!!!"}
{"text":"The place is relatively small so you would want to make reservations.  The seafood is good but anything else (I.e vegetables) is just mediocre.  If you don't order the more pricey meals the servers give you a dirty look and will keep pushing you to order more.  You would also get rushed out once you look like you are winding down on food.    Overll, pricey but good seafood - everything else isn't great"}
{"text":"I went to this place with my parents and my sister a few weeks ago, and the tables were almost full, but there were some left in the corner. It was a nice evening, and we we were just looking for somewhere to eat. As soon as we got in, my sister already thought the place was dirty, but I was fine with it. We ordered the fried rice and the crab, because weren't too hungry, as we already had too much for lunch. It took about 20 minutes to serve, and I would say it was worth it. The fried rice was so good, I could live on that stuff(seriously, if you're reading this, you need to go there and try it)! The crab was okay, as it was slightly undercooked, and it was served kind of messily. Overall, I'd come here again.  6.5/10"}
{"text":"My family came here because Fisherman's Lobster House was completely booked for Chinese New Year. We had the lobster with fried garlic, steamed fish, king crab, fried oysters, rice noodles with beef and a fried rice with lobster \"goh\" (lobster... insides).   My favourite thing was definitely the fried garlic with the lobster, it was so good I could eat it with rice for days. I'm usually not a fan of eating seafood with shells in public cause it's so messy but they provide these little plastic gloves so you don't have to get your hands dirty. The lobster was HUGE and my cousin and I did the math, the lobster we had was 26 years old! (That's older than me) The rest of the seafood was good but not memorable. I would not recommend the rice noodles or the fried rice though - they seem to have made it in a hurry and it didn't have much taste (which I guess was good to balance out the heavy garlic but I would not recommend it on it's own)."}
{"text":"The lobster here is OK but the service isn't great and the fried rice and vegetables are a joke. I came here for my father's birthday and the money we spent here could've gotten us a much better meal elsewhere. I don't recommend this lobster place to anyone. You can find much better places. Also, anything but lobster (side dishes like rice, noodles, eggplant) taste terrible. Had a very bad experience here."}
{"text":"Decent place, it's expensive but the quality of the food is quite good.  Came here for a family dinner, we ordered a variety of seafood dishes:  King Crab (they steamed it, and served it on 3 different plates, because it was too large to serve it on one) From the crab legs to the shell, it was simply steamed with a bit of vegetable seasoning on it.  I liked it because it brings out the flavour of the crab.  Lobster (8lbs) this was a monster of a lobster, we had a table of 10 and we couldn't finish all of it. It was made with garlic, very delicious, probably the highlight of the night  Then there were steamed fish (again, made very well), chicken, clams, and some boiled vegetables.  Service was great as well, they would also change our plates when we had filled them from all the shells of the crab and lobster."}
{"text":"This place is REALLY REALLY over priced. I can't believe how expensive lobster in Toronto can be.   First of all, the decor was again, pretty average. The only complaint that I have goes with all Asian places. The washrooms are filthy. Do Not Touch Anything in there.   The service was pretty good. Considering we are paying a premium for the food,  good service is to be expected. The change our plates once a dish, and constantly comes by to make sure that we are enjoying the meal.   The food, on the other hand, isn't very good. I mean there is only so many ways that you can eat seafood. Most of the live seafood was fresh, but some of the smaller fish, and cut fish wasn't that good. If you are interested in getting great seafood, make sure that they are getting the animal from the tank. If not, it doesn't taste that fresh.   The first taste of all the food is very good. Unfortunately, it starts deteriorating from there. After the 4th bite, you start to feel sick from eating so much lobster. By the end of the night, you just want to go home and puke it all out.   Again, maybe i'm not a seafood person, but if you like seafood only in moderation, this place isn't for you."}
{"text":"The young girl that served me was amazing, she was so cute and had very good energy. The lobster was great and"}
{"text":"ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE--From start to finish!!! So much so that I'm typing this at the restaurant). From the looks we got from the waitstaff when we walked in to the horrible service to the horrible food! I wish I'd read the reviews before coming here but it was recommended by  a coworker and I was excited to try it. Never again.  I agree with the previous posts--they definitely did the bait and switch with the lobster, the fish was not fresh, the rice was brought out 30 minutes after the meal (after repeatedly requesting it)  and everything was flavorless. That along with the language barrier and horrible attitude of the waitress (we had to constantly call on others-there were 3 other parties there)...NEVER again. The fact that they tried to charge extra because the lobster was a little over 6lbs (the one we were served definitely was NOT) the waitress lied and told the manager she told us along with the fact that they had the nerve to automatically include gratuity (there was 3 of us) was the icing on the cake. We absolutely refused to pay it and left without getting the dessert (I'm sure it was horrible too). If I could give it no stars I would."}
{"text":"Its 35 degrees today and feels like 39. And this restaurant doesnt have AC?!? We ordered a set dinner and the deep fried garlic lobster that comes wih the fried little fishies, was SO HARD that it hurt my teeth. Meaning they are refrying and reusing their food. The place itself is very crowded and not much room to even walk to the washroom. Stick with Fishermans House. Dont bother coming here"}
{"text":"My boss treated us to a beautiful Seafood dinner tonite.  We had Alaskan King Crab, Lobster, Steamed Fish,  Veggies,  Steak cubes with veggies, Special Fried Rice and more.  Finished off with their home made Sesame dessert.  Food was prepared perfectly, flavourful and tasty.  So delicious.  Staff are so friendly and professional.  I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Probably the worst lobster house replica in the GTA.   Brought my family here for lunch as they had an advertisement for a two person special for 28.99. We also called in before to confirm the deal, they assured us that it is for any date and any time. We let them know we were heading in.   When we got there, we were seated and handed menus that started from 101.99. We politely asked for the special and the waiter said it was on,y for lunch. We let him know that we called in earlier and he gave a huge dissatisfied sigh and said, \"fine, I'll get you the other menu\".   When we were handed the alternative menu, we felt ignore for quite some time. As if our order isn't large enough to deem worthy as a customer. To keep in mind, my purchase was been between 60-80 for two.   Upon receiving the food, I was bewildered. There wasn't much seafood on the plate, noodles were soggy, rice dish was so bland.  I tried my best to seek something good in the dishes, but could NOT.  Not only were the dishes extremely overpriced for what they are, they completely ignored us As customers. All the staff seemed to huddle around the table that ordered the most expensive dishes.  Which is fair, but I recalled them so many times without success.   Overall, I'm extremely disappointed at this restaurant.  Not only is their food dissatisfying, their service is determined by how much you spend at the restaurant.   I have experienced many Chinese seafood restaurants, and decided to give this place a try, and will no longer be returning.   I recommend to spend your money elsewhere, rather than visiting then leaving with a distasteful experience in the Chinese seafood category."}
{"text":"came here for CNY dinner with family last night and it was not a good experience. They didn't have many servers available and everything was not presented in an orderly manner. We ordered the package that came with lobster (6 lbs), steamed fish and veggies. We figured it wasn't enough so we added some oysters and fried rice. They were probably not use to being so busy as a restaurant. It is a relatively small restaurant with only 3 servers available, the lobster came out first, they were being kinda cheap on the fried garlic and mini fishies (minus 1 star) compared to Fisherman Lobster Club House, as they give you way more than you can imagine. The veggies was seriously a joke because it was boiled in hot water without salt and/or chicken broth. They were too lazy to even do that?! Blah~ (*minus 1 star)  At the end when we were trying to get the bill, we realized the steamed fish never came but we already had our dessert. We asked what happened and they wanted to steam us the fish after we had our dessert? (minus 1 star) for service and we said \"NO\" just deduct the price of the fish and they said they couldn't do that since it was a package...well it's not my fault the fish never came...so we ended up not being happy and said well just don't charge us for the oysters that we ordered as an extra item (although the price was lower than the fish) they finally agreed and gave us the bill....we gave them a low tip since we were not satisfied with food and service...  Not coming back here until I see some very impressive reviews...note to self...Fishman Lobster Club House is irreplaceable!!!"}
{"text":"I blame this place for starting the onslaught of mediocre lobster theme Chinese eateries in the GTA. Countless other imitators have appeared (mostly within 3 kms of this place) since I've last visited this place.  I am not really going to go into too much detail about the atmosphere, service...blah blah blah. It is what it is and it's just like any other Chinese restaurant. Service like the tables are just as spotty as the washrooms in terms of cleanliness. So that about sums up that part. Price wise, I really have no complaints. You know what you are getting in to when you've summoned the courage to consume an 8lb lobster.  Food wise, you can't really go wrong with fresh seafood and indeed it is fresh. However, I think the lobsters have been hanging out in the deep fryer a little longer than their shift. The meat is noticeably firmer, dryer and slightly more chewier than most I've had. BTW, if you don't know yet...most Chinese restaurant use a fast-fry method to pre-cook most of the meats, seafood and sometimes veggies before stir-frying it. It saves time, energy and helps prevent the product from bleeding too much water so it remains crispy and colourful. Anyhow, I don't want to get all Yan-can-cook on you.  Furthermore, the lobsters are buried in so much garlic that it resembles a replica of the Gobi dessert. I am a huge garlic lover but even I was a bit overwhelmed and it really masks that salty, seaweed, sea water taste found in food from the sea.  And therein lies the problem with this place as well as all others alike. Seafood should not be fried and overdressed unless it's fish and chips. If you must, then get it steamed or in the tradition ginger garlic sauce (still fried but minus all the garlic).  Anyhow, they have managed to take a beautiful and delicate morsel from the sea and turned it into a garlic laced, deep fried lobster...sans the flavours. This stuff sure looks impressive but appearances can be deceiving."}
{"text":"Lobster King was the birth place of The Fisherman Lobster Club House which has recently moved right down the road on Silver Star Blvd. This was a birthday meal for my dad and so we wanted to try the new location of the Lobster Club House. We got there at 5:30pm on a Sunday night. We were told all seats were reserved for the night (what a disappointment - mental note: make appointment for next time). So we took our business to the birth place of Lobster Club House which is now Lobster King. The place was pretty much empty. We ordered the meal for four @ $128 which came with a plate of veggies, a steamed bass and a 6lb lobster. We also added a fried eel dish for $19.99. The server showed us the live lobster we were going to be eating and she showed us a sticker of the weight of the lobster. It marked 6.96 lbs so they charged us an extra $16.95. Of course there is no freakin way we would have known it was 6.96 lbs - They really could have put 8 lbs on the sticker and we would have believed it and for all we know this could be a tactic they use to make extra money but  I will take their word for it.   All the food was just as good as I remembered when it was the Lobster Club House. This is also the first time we got such a huge lobster. The other times we were too cheap and only ate a 3 pounder. This time since it was for my fathers birthday we went all out. I will never forget the first bite I took. It was so juicy when the lobster is prepared fried instead of deep fried. Since it was 6lb of lobster to share between 4 people I did not hold back. I grabbed a huge chunk of lobster and shoved it into my mouth. Having your mouth filled to the max with lobster was amazing. Picture a huge burger that is too tall for your mouth - so you open your mouth as wide as possible and take the biggest bite possible of the burger - now replace the burger with a huge piece of lobster tail. That's basically what it felt like. Yummmy 5/5 stars  The eel dish was okay and I've definitely had better but what made this dish stand out was the little baby deep fried fish that was scattered all over the eel. The fishies were so crispy and yummy (poor little baby fishies). I must have killed at least 20 baby fishes that night. 4/5 stars. The steamed bass was good as well but was overcome by the lobster. 3/5 stars. The meal also came with soup as an appetizer and black sesame soup for dessert.   A great overall experience, 4/5 stars overall. Note sure why Lobster King is so empty and Lobster Club House was so packed but its pretty much the same thing. I'm pretty sure all the people that came to Lobster King that night were people who were rejected by Lobster Club House.  A final note: Use the plastic gloves they provide to eat the lobster. No use using a fork. You gotta get your hands dirty for this one."}
{"text":"I've been here twice, and both meals were outstanding. Lobster King is known for their lobsters (obviously), and they do them well. The lobsters are large, and they can cook them in many different flavours. My personal favourite is the egg yolk sauce. This restaurant isn't the best looking restaurant, so it's relatively casual dining. However, it's still a fantastic place to bring family and friends. I recommend the set menus; you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Great food for the price. Great value hands down. But ghetto washrooms and below par for decor and ambiance. It's a hole in the wall thats a but run down, that has very cheap good food, but I wouldn't take my parents here."}
{"text":"This location used to be he old fishermans wharf a couple years back. However it was bought but another owner, I came a couple times before and he food was good. However this time the taste was a bit bland and the quality went down hill a bit. A bit disappointed since they had pretty descent food before.  Bill came out to be $60 per person for a 10 course meal for 13 ppl"}
{"text":"+.5 for service  If you're a broke family who wants lobster but doesn't wanna spend money on places nearby like Fishman Lobster, Fishmen Wharf Seafood, etc...this place is for you. No gimmicks, no decorations, straight up lobster and seafood for affordable prices.  As you enter this place, you'll be greeted with aquariums of lobster sitting and about to be eaten by the likes of you. It's a little freaky, but hey, it's reality. Where else would they get lobster from?  I came with my dad's company, which had a company dinner that consisted of 12 people. We had an 8lb garlic lobster, raw oysters, king crab, steamed fish, chicken, and boiled vegetables.  The lobster, oysters, and crab were all very good. Granted it's not top tier quality, but for the price we paid (~$400) it was definitely of excellent value. The oysters were surprisingly juicy even though the presentation looked like it lacked meat. The steamed fish, chicken, and boiled vegetables, on the other hand, lacked the quality set by the shellfish meals, and were largely forgettable.  Meal came with starter soup and dessert, both of which were average taste and also forgettable.  Service was good for Asian standards. The restaurant is small enough that you get good treatment.  I don't think I'll personally return here unless I'm with a big group, since the meals are targetted towards large parties."}
{"text":"?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"Less $$$ less Fisherman's Lobster but smaller place, though easier to get a table.  The guitar bet stand just right but the  cheesy lobster dish was over rated.  Saw hear reviews online so we went to try it.  But  it was a bit dry, definitely not enough cheese and  totally  sort in  yee mein too.  Place  was not 100% clean and the  crowd was loud and drunk. Service was good."}
{"text":"Seafood place like other seafood restaurant that serve huge king carb n lobster, the taste n presentation also very similar, however, the main advantage here is the price is very competitive. we ordered a dinner set n added two extra dishes (one beef dish n one vegetables dish) bill came with tax n tips is around $50/person. To me the price is very reasonable for these kind of seafood. Also the service is considered good at chinese restaurant. One star lost on the hygiene n old decorations."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a place where they try to maximize the number of seats and minimize your level of comfort, look no further!  This restaurant is very small to start and they try to fit as many people in to maximize profits lol. I came with a group of 14 so we ordered one of their huge sets which included lobster and crab. We were presented with the live lobster and crab shortly after when they were dropped on our table. They were still live and crawling around on the lazy Susan. They took them away afterwards and just left the puddles of water on the table. Talk about unsanitary.   The food came pretty quickly but was nothing spectacular. The service or lack thereof was also very evident with the attitude we received.   I would never go back."}
{"text":"The seafood here is great. We couldn't get a reservation at Fisherman Clubhouse, so came here instead, and we were not disappointed.   Got two 6lb lobsters. The Deep Fried with Dry Garlic was amazing. We also got a deep fried crab in 1000 yr old egg yolk, Eel, Clams, Steamed Fish package.    Service was surprisingly not bad either.   Food was delicious, and the price was decent too."}
{"text":"Do not come here.  This place is a scam.  The food was mediocre, but what I want to complain is first of all, cash and debit only, meaning they probably does not report the proper tax to the government.  Then they impose the tips on top.  My bill was $66 before tax and tips, but end up I have to pay $83 with the \"tax and tips\".    It's very shady! If I knew this before hand, I would not even eat here.  A mistake once is good enough."}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times, service was slow but food was not bad.   Today it got much worse and I feel like we were robbed. First the short and chubby lady forgot our order and we had to remind her, came 10 min later again with a Geoduck and said that they didnt have any 2.5lbs ones and that one is bigger, so naturally we were were saying ok because why would you mind; but at the end the bill came with extra 30 dollars, nothing was mentioned before the bill about this. A man looking like the manager stood there for a little and walked away soon, obviously didnt want to get involved.  At the end the lady said 'I dont care if you come in the future anyways'  Very good customer service."}
{"text":"Nothing spectacular. Never disappoints. Lobster is good for many occasions, any occasion!  My family and I frequent Lobster King Seafood Restaurant for special celebrations - birthdays, graduations, going away parties, and festivals. We are not selfish with shellfish!  There is an awesome value menu for 4 for (approximately) $79 (if memory serves me correctly). It includes garlic lobster, free range chicken, oyster mushroom with pea sprouts or bok choi, onion ginger dungeon crab, clam with wine and bay leaf, soup of the day and dessert.  Add $5 for amazing spicy salted lobster with tiny fried fishes! You also have the option for adding steamed fish for $3.99. From time to time, we add the lobster roe fried rice for $10.99. I would recommend asking the chef to reduce the amount of oil used when cooking the vegetable. It tends to get a bit overbearing, in a delicious but fattening way.   We have also tried the King Crab 4-ways menu for 4 for $188. It was delicious in a wallet-hurting type of way. Our wallet shred a tear after the dinner. Great option for high rollers.   I  appreciate how Lobster King pressure their customer less than other seafood establishments in the neighborhood. As well as their frequent plate changing as we filled our plates with shells of crustacean."}
{"text":"Do not come to this place!  We ordered their $359 lobster and king crab meal. Upon ordering, they showed us the seafood fresh and soon after, swapped them for the dead ones they had in the back.   When the food arrived, it was very obvious the seafood was not fresh. The king crab leg meat was unusually crumbly and had an off taste to it. The server was not cooperative either and argued otherwise with a rude attitude.   For this price point, I can get a get a much better value at another restaurant.   Sadly, we can't give 0 stars on Yelp..."}
