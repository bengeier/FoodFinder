{"text":"I give it three stars because it was my first time here and we sat outside. We didn't go inside so I really have no idea what it's like. But sitting outside was perfectly fine with me. Lots of space outside the restaurant letting many customers to enjoy the weather. They have daily deals on drinks and food, changing every day which is really cool and I would go back for the deals. We went on a Saturday which is when brunch is offered til 3pm. I ordered a Cajun omelet. It had this Mexican appeal to it because I got salsa & sour cream with it. And it had a kick. The omelet was large but thin. Not much to it although it was nice and cheesy and that's always important in omelets for me! The prices are cheap too so it works out."}
{"text":"Having just returned from MÃ¼nchen and a fabulous trip to the original Oktoberfest, I was so excited to see the White Horse serving traditional Bavarian sausages at the CU Oktoberfest. I wanted to try them all!

Sweet Moses! The only way they would sell me a sausage is if I paid 8 dollars for a \"meal\" and then they would \"add on\" a sausage for another 3 dollars! I saw massive piles of sausage sitting right behind the woman I was trying to order from. I just wanted a sausage or two and was willing to pay a premium for their sausages. But 8  dollars for one sausage?! Come on. This is a classic rip-off! 

Taking advantage of a community event to make a few extra bucks? Shame. Even the taste of champaign wasn't this blatant. I hope the organizers of Oktoberfest next year  are more judicious in their choice of vendors."}
{"text":"Cheese sausage, potato salad and fries with a Miller Lite for $10 at lunch is a pretty solid offering. Service was solid. This place has some pretty good daily specials during the week. No salt or pepper on the tables even during lunch/dinner hours but that's a minor quibble. Normally Id give 3 stars since the food's only decent but the service and price bring it up to a 4."}
{"text":"I met a good sized group of people in the evening due to the food and drink specials available during the summer. Dollar tacos and two dollar drafts including imports. Whoa!  Great deal and the food wasn't half bad. 

So why two stars?  They were understaffed that day. That is something that I understand and can roll with. Not a problem.  It took 10-15 minutes before the server noticed my gesturing. Eventually I placed a dinner order.  I had ordered a beer and 15 minutes later I made mention of it to the server. I just thought she forgot. Her response was completely uncalled for. Harsh tone, reactionary word choice, scowl...  I asked the table if I came off rude or something. No, I was apparently quite nice. Not only did I feel like walking out, everyone at the table was looking around wondering what the heck just happened. Someone a few people down said \"oh, yeah. That's why we never come here.\"  

We were a polite, hungry, and thirsty group with ages ranging between 20-60.  The staff made us feel like an intrusion as my simple question wasn't the only time we were snapped at and dumbfounded by our treatment. 

The tip was added into the bill. I still gave her a dollar on top of the included gratuity.  She ended up with a 30% tip from me. That is likely the only time I step foot in that place. I was treated like an inconvenience. Trash.  I would have ordered a few more beers. I stopped at one because of the ridiculousness. 

Food, drink, and price was great. The staff is the worst. 

The.  Worst."}
{"text":"White Horse is an ooooold ooooold favorite.  Many was the night, back when I was a drinker, that we'd sit outside on their terrace-- a really nice space... open, but not too open as to feel totally exposed--swapping stories, and telling lies!  Good friends, good (but simple) drinks, in a dive bar that feels more like it's balancing on the razor's edge of being a hole-in-the-wall, and something respectable! ;D"}
{"text":"They are closed for good, very sad to see it, but the rent was just too high to justify keeping it open"}
{"text":"Great big space, plenty of seating around the perimeter.

Lots of tvs and short wait time at the bar despite big gameday crowd.

Not as many young folks as were packing the main student favorites, but that made it a welcome relief after a busy day bar-crawling.

I'll consider another visit!"}
{"text":"Great bar - a live band was playing and they were really solid.  The layout of the place is sweet, from the huge beer garden outside to the centered bar and plenty of tables and space.  Not the best on beer selection though."}
{"text":"only been there during day time. Went once with the whole class for a research on tasting shots. But the place look dead . Maybe its better during weekend night"}
{"text":"We usually come here if we're looking for a quieter, cleaner and relaxed bar experience. This was the case last night after a long ride on my motorcycle.

The inside is spacious, plenty of seating and generally a weak crowd for a Saturday night, but that's kind of what we wanted.

We ordered a couple of Vegas bombs, a vodka lemonade and they also have Left Hand Milk Stout Nitro on draft, so I had to have one of those. Was a little disappointed they used well liquor in the Vegas bombs, I could definitely tell they weren't as good as other places.

Either way, no cover is always nice. We've shot dice and played pool here before. Bathrooms definitely cleaner than most places on campus.

Nice, quieter spot with outdoor seating and decent specials during the week. Have not had the food but heard good things."}
{"text":"I love sausage.  German sausage. You find 15 varieties to choose from sourced from a place in California that's the real deal (continental sausage Glendale CA) and the house made sauerkraut has a sharp vinegar bite, which balanced with the fizzy taste of fermented cabbage and is an awesome complement to the tubes of meat. Served with a German style mustard and German potato salad you have yourself an authentic experience.   At a very reasonable price you can have yourself a great German meal compared with the schlep to Gibson city for the bier stube, which is also amazing but pricey.  Go support these guys who are doing something cool and local!!"}
