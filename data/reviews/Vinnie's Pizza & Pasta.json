{"text":"This place is awesome. The portions are huge, price is reasonable (u can get pasta+sandwich combo for under $8), student discount, and taste great!! I've never gotten a rude staff before but I guess it really depends on when you go. At this price, I don't expect to be treated nicely as long as they serve food, but Ive always had good staff experience. I've seen many Italian places that are way more expensive and tastes as good as Vinnie's but not any more exceptional."}
{"text":"I had the lasagna.  If there was ricotta cheese in it, I could not taste it.   I found it to be a collection of soggy noodles and mozzarella.   I would not eat here again."}
{"text":"Vinnie's Homemade Italian Eatery  I've been coming to Vinnie's since I was in the 10th grade and love their authentic Italian flavours. I usually get pizza or veal parm and both are excellent. Service is kind but not too friendly which is a good thing.   Their marinara sauce is to die for and is available for take home also."}
{"text":"Vinnie's is for people too lazy to walk to any one of the better lunch places around. Or if you're craving sub-par italian food.  They offer pizza, pasta, salad and eggplant and chicken/veal Parmesan sandwiches. All of it is \"meh\". The pasta is precooked and it just sits there under the heat lamp so its not exactly hot when you get it, nor does it look really appetizing. The vegetable sauce is pretty good, tons of veggies and good flavor, but the spicy sauce lacks flavor. I've had both the chicken parm sandwich and the eggplant parm - neither was worth writing about except that the middle of my chicken parm sandwich was raw and the bun (on both sandwiches) was stale. Never again.  The worst part about this place is that the staff is utterly rude and you can tell that they don't give a crap about the customers. And yet at lunchtime, the line soars and they manage to do a good business, I suppose. Oh and last time I went with one of my student employees and when he showed his Ryerson student card, they refused to give him the 10% discount because his sandwich only cost $5.35. Right... what's the point in offering a discount if you won't honour it?  Don't waste your time here - walk an extra 3 minutes to the pizza pizza, or 5 to big slice."}
