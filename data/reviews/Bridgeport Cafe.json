{"text":"Excellent food, staff and prices.   I have only had breakfast at Bridgeport and everything is wonderful. It's nice to have a healthy quick option for breakfast in this area.  Just had an Everything Bagel sandwich with turkey sausage. I wish I would have taken a picture to post but it will have to wait until next time. (I was starving)  Looking forward to trying some items on the much menu."}

{"text":"Stopped on my way to a meeting to get breakfast to go. I ordered a breakfast sandwich and hot chocolate. Both were fabulous.  First, the service was great! Both employees were friendly and made me laugh.  Second, the sandwich was turkey sausage, scrambled eggs, cheddar cheese on a croissant. They had tons of options to choose from. It was a great combo and really large. I only ate half and was full. The hot chocolate was good too, but they only have 2% and soy milk which I wasn't aware of until after I ordered."}
{"text":"Good, fresh food, attentive service, at a great price!"}
