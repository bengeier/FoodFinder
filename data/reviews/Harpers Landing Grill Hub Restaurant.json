{"text":"Awesome place I love the hot wings however it would be better if there were more choices for wings I thinks I would be happier and a lot of other people would be."}
{"text":"Huge, noisy, long wait at the front door. I ordered the lobster fettuccine for $35/ plate. The lobster was terribly spongy and overcooked, the fettuccine was cooked to mush with no garlicky flavour. I had to ask for a spoon for my pasta which came after my dinner was cold. There was no bread on the table and when I asked for some, the server brought a piece of garlic toast (straight from the eighties) just for me and not my dinner companion. The staff being so young and poorly trained were a bad reflection of the restaurant depicted on their website which showcases beautiful cuisine. My experience was closer to being at a crowded overpriced Olive Garden...in my opinion. The atmosphere would make an okay patio/ bar scene if you don't mind overlooking a parking lot. They corked my wine which I do appreciate. I think they're best advised to make some changes quickly because once the buzz surrounding their novelty leaves...."}
{"text":"Brunch is my favourite here! The chicken and waffles is amazing! The French toast is delicious as well, like a cheesecake...it's really dessert as breakfast.   In terms of dinner, the calamari is a must have appetizer.   The harpers caesars is massive and great to try, comes with a slider, lobster and cured meat.   The open deck patio is nice and just opened last week. The sangria pitcher is also good to have!   Hope this helps -jT"}
{"text":"This place is always busy no matter the time of day. In the Summer they have a wonderful patio to sit out on. I often get take out food from here and it never disappoints. It's a modern feel inside and is pretty new to the Oakville area. The owner and staff are always friendly and even when things are going wrong they still smile and do their best."}
{"text":"Went to Harper's today for lunch with a friend. I haven't been there in a few months. I could not find my favorite salad in the menue, (Caperse salad) so I asked the waitress. .only to find they took it off the menue.  Very dissapointing!!! That's what I went  there for!!!    Had a burger instead , which was good. .but not what I wanted. ..Also, way too many flies flying around my food. Don't k ow if I'll be back."}
{"text":"The food was good but the service was terrible. These people don't know anything about customer service. Its my birthday dinner, did not get any balloons like the other tables celebrating and no birthday cake. Dark atmosphere, slow service,  crowded tables, poor organization."}
{"text":"This is a nice upscale chain with local and seasonal fare. The interior and ambiance were very nice and the location is accessible. The menu varies, but as previous people have stated the service was only okay and the food took a long time to arrive at the table. They were also quite slow getting the check, but the food was good. Overall, I recommend it for a nice lunch or date night. Really young children cannot fully appreciate this food so leave them elsewhere."}
{"text":"This is our second visit to this establishment and our server, Jarred, was excellent. We had the luncheon menu and were suitably impressed. I gave the first review of this restaurant and came away very satisfied and knowing that I will return. The second visit did not disappoint. The ambience, employees, menu and quality of the food is all above par and worthy of your visitation."}
{"text":"Harper's Landing was definitely a great meal experience that I would recommend to anyone in the Oakville. The service, setup, and of course, food, made it a place I will consistently dine out at for years to come with not only my friends but my family as well.  Firstly, the service was great. Coming on a Saturday night with two friends, we were seated in a decent amount of time despite the restaurant being quite lively and full. I noticed there were a lot of servers, which contributed to the attentiveness of my own. I'll also note that the place had a very diverse crowd with some families, some friends, and some couples.  Next, I really liked the setup. The TVs, playing both the Habs game and Access Hollywood were easily viewable from even the back of the restaurant. The setup had an inviting feel, as it is an open room with booths around, tables closer to the middle and the bar with TVs on the centre. It created a nice vibe that enhanced the experience.  Lastly, the food was simply incredible! The BBQ chicken wings, my entree shared with the three of us, were the best I've had in years. I had the Hunter's Landing burger, which was very filling and juicy, and sweet potato fries that was also the best of its kind I've had in a while. I cut a bit of my friends sirloin for myself, and it also didn't fail to impress. And, of course, what night out wouldn't be complete without the wine. The substantial selection made me even more fond of this place.  As if I haven't raved about it enough, this place was a great time and a great option for all crowds."}
{"text":"Superb!!! Ate here with the kids 9 & 10 and it was excellent. Atmosphere:    - lends itself to all groups: family, couples, etc.  The bar area is great for adults either with or looking for that special someone.  Food:  - All the food was perfectly portioned - Kids steak was cooked to perfection. Perfect portion for a kid.  - Both burgers on the menu were delicious. Especially the harpers burger. They grind the meat daily in house and it shows.  - chicken focaccia sandwich super flavourful.... Just fantastic! - Dessert: sticky toffee pudding!  OMG!  I only eat this at Christmas. It's the only time I'm willing to go through that much trouble.     So just the fact that they have it on the menu makes me want to squeal with glee. Sadly, I was NOT disappointed! ;) (that's my ego talking)The sticky toffee here is the real deal! The raspberry gelato was the best I've ever tasted!  Try it out .... You won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"I had the BBQ Jack fruit sandwich with sweet potato fries and my husband ordered the Harpers greens. My husband's meal was vegan and even asking the server if my sandwich  was vegan and telling her I'm vegan  I have a feeling there might be butter or something on it or in that might not make it vegan...just double ask before if your vegan.  All in all the food was great but the harpers greens come in a small bowl...not very filling....waitress/atmosphere  was pleasant."}
{"text":"I like this place because it is convenient, it has a great atmosphere, and its easy and comfortable at the same time...I can go here in my runners and jeans or dolled up.  I can hang out here with my friends from work for drinks or take a client here for lunch.   I don't think its meant to be a foodie haven and I usually just get aps and have the ahi tuna salad, however, I think the food is pretty good for the value...and it's pretty \"happening\" for Oakville on a weeknight."}
{"text":"Food ain't that good. We ordered a bunch if dishes and no one was impressed. Ambience and vibe was 10/10. Staff is helpful. Basically it's a swanky high end bar, but loads of fun."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Nice setting and good looking interior.  Food was good, service was good.  We will come again."}
{"text":"Been here twice, sat both inside and outside. This place caters to a much younger crowd or a bunch of yuppies, rich kids and randoms. It's got a great patio with a outdoor fireplace and a good buzz, the inside table seating also opens up into the outdoor patio during summer season. It is clean but be prepared to wait a long period for a table on busy days Thursday, Friday - Sunday. Food wise is decent, portions are good sized. I wouldn't say it is 4-5 star quality but on par with pubs and gastro-pubs. Music is loud, lots of attractive young ladies as hostesses and the service is decent."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place a 2.5 star rating because that was our experience: middle of the road, with some good and some bad things to say about it. We were there for New Years Eve and although the food was quite good (especially the meaty wings and the $18 appetizer scallops), it was very pricey for the size of the portions. Our waitress was very efficient but she kept calling everyone \"dear\" despite the fact we were substantially older than she was! They didn't have a delineated dance floor which was very disappointing as they did have a DJ playing some good music. People started dancing beside their table which was kind of strange to see. We would suggest management put speakers and lighting into a section of the place to encourage dancing if they are going to have special events like that again. We might go there again but would like to see a greater range of food choice and some more moderate prices on the menu. As other reviewers mentioned, the place is new and has lots of potential---it also has a large patio area to the side that should be a good place to hang out in the summer."}
{"text":"A great place for business, pleasure & family! Consistently great food, friendly staff & mgmt. Oakville needed Harpers because most restaurants of this level sucks in Oakville in food quality & service!"}
{"text":"Good location and decor. Horrible food. Only saving grace is the servers are very nice."}
{"text":"It's the best place to wine and dine in Oakville that's upscale.  We are regulars there for a few years and the quality of food and service are consistent.  Our only issue now is menu fatigue. We need new items or changes to the menus to keep on going. Overall we love the place."}
{"text":"First time dining at Harper's Landing, wasn't too surprised with the food. The decor and atmosphere I enjoyed a lot.   However I honestly don't think the food was worth the price. We had the mozzarella appetizer and that was delicious. The entrees were mediocre. I forgot the name of what I ordered, it was one of the vegan pastas. That was a disappointment, I just are half and all of the mushrooms since that was what had flavor. Now I never ordered a vegan pasta before so maybe it's my bad for picking that dish. The curry chicken was good compared to my pasta, but the rice could use some more work.    Would I come back? On the fence. It's just not in my price range."}
{"text":"Great place with awesome ambience; calamari was done to perfection; choice of beers could have been better but can't complain; food is great; place was busy; staff was very welcoming and service was superb."}
{"text":"Good Ambience. Young vibe. Helpful Staff. Food was Good. Expensive place.  I ordered I don't remember the exact name of the dish but it was a Chicken curry which comes with some rice which was good. They have a decent cocktail menu. We were a group of 6 people and out of all the cocktails/wines that we ordered, the biggest serving was of \"yacht club\" cocktail. So, If you want a value for money, generous quantity cocktail, order the vodka based \"yacht club\" cocktail."}
{"text":"Had lunch here today..my first time here. I had a visitor from out of town and wanted to showcase Oakville and make a good impression. Happy to report Harper's Landing delivered in every way..food, service, ambience and overall impression!  We ordered fish tacos, meatballs & the steak frites.. all delicious. Grand finale was sticky toffee pudding.. it was to die for. What was very impressive also was a visit by the chef & Manager to our table to check on how we were doing.. nice personal touch for sure! Came away happy, content & with a very impressed visitor! Keep up the high standards..I look forward to coming back in summer to enjoy your patio with beautiful hanging planters I have always admired while driving by. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Been here a few times and I recommend the quinoa burger. The kids meal is GREAT VALUE $10.99 for a ton of stuff. But boy are they slow. You could be here for 2 hours easily."}
{"text":"Hate to put such a low rating but the food was below par. I ordered the lobster fettuccini and the lobster was very good but the pasta was poorly cooked and not very tasty. My wife ordered the seafood risotto which again, the seafood was seasoned ok, but the risotto was completely mush and absolutely horrible. Ordered toffee pudding for dessert and it was wonderful. Seems like they have good seasoning for seafood but the cooks are horrible at cooking pasta and risotto. I didn't order the steak because a friend said their steaks aren't very good. Waitress was excellent and very pleasant to talk to."}
{"text":"Very nice inside with terrific ambiance and a great wine list. They have an Enomatic machine allowing them to pour premium wines for 3 oz pours. The service was on the slower side throughout the evening but still a nice evening. Be sure you are not in a hurry and bring along your patience."}
{"text":"The atmosphere and drinks are great, but the food is ok. Nothing special about the food, but it isn't bad. I would recommend the \"Venetian sparkle\" drink! I've been here three times, but today we got the cheese and meat platter, sliders, and calamari. The atmosphere is cozy and they had a DJ on a Friday night. In the summer their outdoor patio is open so it's even better!"}
{"text":"This place looses 1 star because the food took a little long to arrive.   The food however was excellent. A great placed for a drink and a bite."}
{"text":"We came here for drinks on a warm Saturday in June and wow, what a great atmosphere. The windows were all open and it was packed. The wait time was long to get patio seats so we just sat at the bar. The service was good and the bartenders, even though they were busy, were very attentive and friendly and quick with our drinks. I tried the charred manhatten which was reasonable priced at $13. Ive seen these types of drinks elsewhere for higher. We really only came here for drinks but decided to try the fish tacos. They were superb. The fish was fresh and fried to perfection. Definitely will be coming back to this place!"}
{"text":"I've been here several times and I get the pan seared scallops and pork belly every time. Friends have gotten tacos, sliders, and flatbreads and they've all enjoyed their food. It's great when the weather is nice because they can open the large garage doors to the patio so even if you're sitting inside, it's almost like you're outside. This is one of my go-to restaurants when I visit Oakville."}
{"text":"Cool bar/resto in Oakville. We shared for 2 the Asado Board and the Landing Salad. Both were really good. The service is great and the prices were reasonable."}
{"text":"Awesome menu, great atmosphere and tremendous service....  Lively crowd and overall very FUN and ENERGETIC environment   Best restaurant in Oakville for sure"}
{"text":"Very delicious food and accommodates a variety of food allergies/intolerances. Excellent service, beautiful and trendy restaurant. I recommend it!"}
{"text":"I passed by here on the train a few times, and I heard some good thing about the place, so I figured I'd stop by one night with my girlfriend. We arrived, and although we did face somewhat of a wait (partially my fault, didn't make a reservation as we kinda made a last minute decision) the hostesses were always attentive and prompt to update us with how long the wait could be expected. So after about a 25-30 minute wait we're seated, but at least it was worth the wait! All of the seating, decor and design wise is all up to par and leaves little to be desired. We had calamari to split, I myself ordered some scallops and my girlfriend had the lobster fettuccine. All expertly prepared, taste and texture right as they should be on all the items! Service as usual was prompt and at no point did we feel like the wait was unreasonable. One thing I'd like to point out is that while service was still prompt and there when you needed it, they didn't get too pushy with constantly checking on things, a lot of places seem to overdo that so that's always a refreshing change. That being said, it is on the pricy end, but that, like the wait time, is backed up by quality if nothing else. They didn't seem to have comment cards so we had to actually request the manager to give our compliments to the staff (if you  guys,at HL are reading we apologize if we may have scared you!).  All in all, an exceptionally nice place if you have a few extra banknotes in your wallet and some patience (unless you reserve!)"}
{"text":"3.5 stars Food and service are ok. Great restaurant design. Great menu only if it can be deliver. Well presented Server, but forgot my drink after deliver appetizer and have to be remind - not very busy at that time. Steak over price (1.not well rested before serve - blood leak out like river once you cut open. 2.Meat quality are fair, doesn't taste like A grade US Angus.) Curry chicken is good choice, well combination. I could see chief creative side. Oyster fresh - but server should explain to customer what kind of sauces are on the plate - serving 101.   Manager well spoken and great manor, willing to listen and very proactive. Given me a discount - well played.   This restaurant can be a 5 five with some discipline server training and kitchen quality control. Wish Tom Altosaar all the best.   Will I return - yes!"}
{"text":"Great patio, great menu, and absolutely great servers too. Jamie was absolutely amazing he's a 5 star server!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing. I had the lobster linguine - highly recommend. The service was fairy slow but the staff were friendly."}
{"text":"Just recently visited Harpers Landing with two guest and was astonished and amazed at the terrible service and food. We waited twenty minutes for flat beer.  Then our meals were cold and when the owner came to address it he was inappropriate and had no customer service experience. He came across confrontational and had no understanding of how to run a restaurant. He escalated the situation. I have never had such terrible service and food. It's over priced and was run in a below standard manner. I would never recommend this restaurant and would never return."}
{"text":"Where's the beef?  This is my third try here and they really need to improve their food. I had some beef brisket sliders. The price works out to $4 each. For  tiny buns with arugula and NO meat.  The side plates on the table were all dirty. If they put as much effort into the food operation as they do in hiring beautiful servers they will do well.  But eventually someone will come in this pa of Oakville and knock them out."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere but the food is way below average. Nothing interesting about the menu. I have tried the chicken burger there, the mushroom pizza and a couple of other forgettable things. Nothing special about the beer on tap. Just mass produced crap. A very generic and unimpressive place in terms of food and drinks. The service is the only good thing about this place."}
{"text":"Very nice addition to this part of oakville. Very huge location too. This seems to be the new hip and hAppening spot for young people to go to at night here in this neck of the woods. We shared the tacos and I had a meat dish and everything came out promptly and was well prepared and presented. Service was friendly and very charming and conversational. I'm sure this'll be a go to spot whenever in in oakville! It's a very fun atmosphere. Only comment is don't go here if your needing a catchup or quality intimate chat because it seems to be always loud."}
{"text":"I went here for a Saturday brunch with two girlfriends the weekend before Christmas. I called three days in advance for an 10am reservation. The hostess who answered the phone was wonderful. She let me know that she would request for us to be by the fireplace since it's the best seat in the house and suggested we move our reservations to 11am if we were interested in having mimosas. I took her up on the recommendation because what is brunch without mimosas?! Our server was lovely. She was attentive and informative. One of my girlfriends and I both ordered the chicken and waffles. OMG SO GOOD! By far the best presentation of chicken and waffles I have ever seen. My other friend ordered the Chartwell eggs benedict and said they were also amazing. Of course we started with the scones because they are our favourite. Always have the scones. It's just a rule. Overall amazing experience. We will be back for brunch for sure."}
{"text":"Go to this place for the scene, not the service or food.  I've been about 5 times and each time have been all but ignored by the servers. Empty beverages, no condiments, no cutlery, repeated requests for drink menu, etc.  The food is rather unremarkable. Went on a Sunday evening for dinner and was fascinated by the fact that they were blaring top 40 from the 2000s to today. I've also been appalled by the amount of skin being shown by the female staff. Why aren't the men showing just as much skin??"}
{"text":"Go with a couple of friends before heading out, grab a few drinks and appetizers. Skip the main course"}
{"text":"Nice new resto in Oakville got to try it!  Nice open concept with a large patio.  Yes finally a patio in Oakville!  Smoked salmon app was well presented and  good although the sunflower bread tasted more like a dessert than a complement for the salmon.  The apple slaw was a nice side.  Steak frites is... Steak frites.  Tender piece of meat and crisp fries. Salmon salad was a nice grain mix with salad greens  and toasted chick peas, almond slivers for crunch and apricot slivers for sweetness.  The only weird part was the the wet compress clumps of kale in the salad.  Not sure it was a complementary mix of greens. Overall a good night out.  Service was attentive and very friendly.  Will come back!"}
{"text":"Service was a bit slow, the food reminded me of a Joeys, but not as good.   Portion size was an issue.   It's just a little too average, especially for the price.   Too many more interesting options to go back. But worth at least a single visit."}
{"text":"Came here with a few people for some Sunday brunch & day drinking. The food was pretty good. The mussels were pretty small and I noticed there were a lot of empty shells. I'd still like to explore their menu a little more. Seems as though some of their other items are worth a return visit."}
{"text":"I was really excited to eat here. And when I did, the food was nothing short of great. Their chicken Parmesan was very italian.  But what brought this review down to 3 stars was my bathroom experience. I had just downed two microwave burritos at lunch and my poor gastrointestinal decisions caught up to me and had to use the bathroom at this restaurant. The toilet seat was very sticky, my bottom was latched on for dear life and standing up was like pulling off a large bandaid slowly. Painful. My tears apparently weren't heard by anyone in the restaurant, and I wasn't rescued until my two kids came in to see if I was okay after I was trapped for an hour and 20 minutes. But it was really good chicken Parmesan"}
{"text":"May have a great atmosphere and vibe.  May have good and friendly service.  But the food is so bad that it negates it all.    $3 dollar oysters had shells in them and condiments that just don't fit.  Steak from the steak and frites dish had a bad taste, likely sitting uncovered for some time before cooking.  With such a small basic menu and a large kitchen, these are not mistakes that should be present."}
{"text":"The food here is pretty delicious and the restaurant has a really fun atmosphere, but the prices are pretty outrageous. I went with my family to celebrate my brother's birthday, so we ordered a bunch of dishes to share including the Steamed Edamame, Signature Fish Tacos, Pan Seared Scallops and Pecan Crusted Goat Cheese. My personal favourite were the fish tacos, because they were put together really well and had an excellent balance of flavours, including some that I didn't recognize. But overall, the appetizers were done well and I actually think I preferred them over the main courses.   My family is big on sharing food, so although I ordered the Prosciutto pizza for myself, I got the chance to try the Turkey Burger, Scallop Risotto and Curried Chicken.  The pizza was unlike all the prosciutto pizzas that I've had because it had marinara sauce and cheese covering it's base. Although it was good, it didn't taste like much more than a marinara pizza. The curry dish was nice, with a fantastic array of spices, and definitely one of the more reasonably priced dishes at $20. The burger was very simple, but had a deliciously fresh patty and a buttery bun; definitely a good choice for someone who is opting for a healthier option. The Scallop Risotto was absolutely delicious (except for the asparagus; it's not my favourite veggie), with  a smooth and flavourful sauce. There were a fair amount of scallops, but you were certainly paying for it at $28.   Although the food was good, nothing compared to the Sticky Toffee Pudding that we split (complimentary for my brother's birthday!) for dessert. It was probably the best toffee pudding I've ever had, with a rich flavour and smooth texture. It had a noticeably burnt aftertaste, which I really liked.   Overall, Harper's Landing is a fun place to go with friends and family. They have a lively atmosphere, great food and excellent service. However, the food isn't good enough for what it costs, so expect to pay a pretty penny."}
{"text":"I've been going to Harpers for a year now and received the worst customer service ever. I got some form of food poisoning and notified my doctor. She confirmed my symptoms as well. I did not call in to complain because the situation i had to experience was so severe i figured if i went in to notify the after math of the meal from the night before i would be bale to find out if anyone had a similar reaction. I ordered the Carbonara pasta. i usually order this or steak tenderloin. My boyfriend finished the remaining pasta and felt just as worse as i did when we left the restaurant. When we went the day after to explain what happened we did not receive a single form of an apology and were only given medical advice. I explained my doctor had confirmed that i had food poisoning and the general manager by the name of jennifer told me she needs to see a doctors note before I am compensated. I figured because she has so little knowledge of proper customer service i would not receive any compensation. receiving compensation was the least of my problems what made me more uncomfortable was her way of handling this situation.  My mother who was very furious also called back and explained that her lack of skills is not up to general manager standards. Yet again there was no apology given on behalf of the restaurant. we received a gift card for 50$ what bothers me is that this \"general manager\" didn't think to restore the image of the restaurant but argued with me and my mother for an hour. There was still no apology at the end of this and i don't understand how jennifer is a general manager. Food is mediocre and this is not a biased statement because sometime depending on the chef my tenderloin or carbonara comes out either 100% of 50%. all in all if your want to spend this kind of money go to earls ..."}
{"text":"Great addition to Oakville for Sunday brunch.  There's a large patio which is perfect for eating al fresco.  There's a good selection of burgers, salads and eggs benes.  I tried the eggs bene with cold smoked salmon (which is smoked in-house) on a whole wheat croissant.  It was delicious!  The server was attentive and very helpful with information and suggestions on the menu.  Also had a spicy caesar and finished off the meal with the cheesecake.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Nice restaurant.  Went on a Saturday night, place was busy.  We had a turkey burger with salad and the Landing burger, which were all very good.  Sat at the bar.  Waiter was nice.  As usual, waitresses were in short skirts and tight tops.  Do we need this?  Does this really sell more drinks?  Anyways, I would go again to this place."}
{"text":"The food is more like 3* not bad for a fancy bar but nothing that makes you want to come back. But the place is noisy, even at 1:30pm with distorted music in the background. The kicker though is that for 7 of us we were told they would automatically apply 18% gratuity... So the server could not care less. We had to ask for waters, for drink refills and overall she was as unfriendly as it gets. Why bother earning your tip if you know you are getting 18% no matter what. So not really recommended."}
{"text":"I would give them a 3.5 for the food, but a 4 for the Dj and the atmosphere. We were looking for a cool bar to watch the Jays game, and I found this place on Yelp. I made a reservation and it is a good thing I did because it was very busy. They have a great patio, the design of the restaurant is very nice and open concept. People are right it is very loud in here and not for the Jays either! We literally seemed to be the only ones watching the game!!  I got the quinoa burger which really should be called a blackbean burger because that is all you could taste and the texture was quite mushy yet dry. I feel like they need to take a trip to Earth to Table to get an idea of how to do a proper quinoa patty, I appreciate the effort of making a fresh veggie option but this just missed the mark for me. My boyfriend got the turkey burger and meatballs, which he seemed to really enjoy and it all looked good. The French fries need to be a little crunchier. Drinks are a decent price, we shared the radler which was good and I would get again.  The service is good they are extremely attentive, good attitude which is always appreciated.  I would def come back here for the great Friday night Dj and to have a drink but I don't foresee me eating here again unless they up their veggie option game."}
{"text":"Harper's Landing does a good job of differentiating itself from chain-style restaurants that offer a similar line of menu items. This is accomplished through a unique decor and atmosphere that feels a notch above chain restaurants in terms of class/fanciness. The pricing is mostly reasonable, similar or slightly higher than similar items elsewhere. To eat I had the landing burger which tasted very fresh as they claim their burgers are ground in house which really translated into the flavoring. Next time I will try one of there more unique menu items, I was hesitant once the first visit due to the increased variety of irregular ingredients they use. Overall it was a good experience."}
{"text":"Was visiting from San Francisco and a friend brought us here for lunch.  Decor was nice, service was excellent (really accommodated my aunt who has a lot of food allergies), and the food was outstanding!  Definitely worth checking out.  I'll be back next time I'm in TO!"}
{"text":"Its about time Oakville got a modern restaurant for a younger crowd! The layout of the restaurant is fantastic. Its very open and promotes a fun night out. But if you're looking an intimate night out to talk, this place gets pretty loud so I wouldn't recommend it if you're looking for somewhere quiet/The Service is alright but as it gets busy the service starts to decline.   The food is great but it is on the pricier side. I'd recommend the maple roasted chicken!   Overall, depending on my mood I would go back."}
{"text":"So it was my 1st visit at Harper's Landing tonight . And reading some of my fellow Yelpers reviews ,  I was a bit nervous ....but i must say , I enjoyed my self . I was here tonight with a large group of 30 people ..yes 30 of us ...the food was great ! As the service ...which is what most people complain about . But for us everything was Great ! I'd definitely come back !  Atmosphere is very pleasant , I'd say a great place to take a date ! Food is very good . Great selection of drinks . Bring a date and get lucky after !!!"}
{"text":"The service was really extremely slow had to wait for 40 min for the food coming. And my fish and my husband's chicken burger were so gross and cold. Only the girl served us was really nice."}
{"text":"Definitely our go to place for good quality food. Best patio around! A bit expensive but worth the money, food is always consistent. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"This was my third time here on a Sat night. The first two times were decent, however I was appalled by this last visit. When I entered, the lounge area was moderately busy. A few tables were available. Me and my companion were told to wait for the tables to be cleaned. We waited 20 minutes all the while seeing other seated before us. When I inquired again, I was told again that the tables are being cleaned. There were tables which were free and cleaned yet not offered to us. When I asked how much longer this would be, I was told \"soon\". I left, as I couldn't be bothered with shitty service."}
{"text":"Enjoyed pleasant lunch. My companion had the Scallops followed by Margarita Pizza. I had Apple & Broccoli Soup. All well prepared and delivered by charming staff.  Not too busy lunchtime mostly young professionals. Good wine selection but like the current trend getting pricier by the glass."}
{"text":"We have been here many times, all of the food here is tasty and the burgers are to die for, This restaurant can get a little loud sometimes so it's not a good place for quiet conversation. During the summer their patio doors are open and it creates a wonderful breeze throughout the place. The wait staff are very friendly here and the beer on tap is ice cold, A great place for a get together."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere especially in the summer. Food isnt great in contrast to the price but great place to hang out"}
{"text":"I came here for dinner and to watch the NBA All Star Game.  The restaurant boasts a modern and lively atmosphere. There is a large fireplace in one corner, and a patio that wraps around the front of the restaurant, so I can see that this place has the potential to be a happening place, particularly in the summer time. Our server was very understanding to my incessant requests to get the game on the screen, so I was very appreciative of that. I was told they were having \"TV issues\" as the channels would change randomly throughout the night, and they were not able to turn on closed caption.  I was disappointed but nonetheless our server was friendly and attentive to my requests.  The food was good, nothing amazing, and I would consider the price point to be high for the type and quality of food. This place reminds me of Earl's or Joey's, a trendy place, with food that is nothing to write home about.  Service was really what made my experience enjoyable.  We ended up leaving at half time to enjoy the game at home instead."}
{"text":"Went here for brunch with a group of friends and was so glad to see so many of their food choices! I ordered the cheesecake french toast and I think that's the best french toast I've ever had. It was so good that we ordered another order for the table when everyone was done. The fish taco's were good, but nothing out of the ordinary. The mocha was yummy too - so forth and decadent!   Will surely come back, especially for the french toast!"}
{"text":"It was a nice place to have a drink.  The ambiance and service were nice.  The food isn't that tasty however.  We had the calamari appetizer and our mains were the burger and the club sandwich."}
{"text":"Great vibe and service.... food sucks big time! Someone has to tell the chef that all good is f**** underseasoned ...lamburger...turkey burger, fried calamari ...bland....our recent Father's day experience. Beer was not that cold as well."}
{"text":"Late night went for apps. Calamari and meat balls had been recommended by server ...tried both. Both good. Service was friendly and good."}
{"text":"It's a new restaurant in Oakville, and it's kind of a night club, the food reflects that. I had the curry chicken, it was fine but at $19 the price is a little steep. The dish was curry done by a white person. Also the menu says it comes with creme fraiche, it does not, it's just sour cream.   My martini was good, but it should be at $12. Decor..Fine. Food, Fine, Prices, High."}
{"text":"A regular here for drinks and small bites. It's always packed here so it has great energy. The food is pretty good including the calamari and the meat ball app. The burgers are also very good!"}
{"text":"First time dining at this location in Oakville. (Usually  I visit the woodbine location cause it's closer to home). The food is as expected ~ the typical bar menu items. The ambiance, food, is typical of a \"bar environment\". I would go back when the weather gets warmer to enjoy the patio."}
{"text":"I came here for an early dinner on a weekday, it was pretty busy as a lot of the other tables were full with large groups. The restaurant it self is very nice and large and the patio looks as if it would be great on a nice summer day. I ordered the landing burger and it was tasty no complaints towards the food.  The restaurant though had a lot of screaming children who were running around the restaurant and although that isn't the fault of the staff they should have asked the parents to have their children be seated quietly. Going into a restaurant and paying to sit there and having to deal with people misbehaving kids is in no way fair to any of the other people in the restaurant. I don't want to deal with anyone's kids and some parents just need to be told that their children's behaviour is just unacceptable.   The staff wasn't that welcoming either they seemed unfriendly and as if they really didn't want to be there. We were sitting at our table waiting for probably 20 minutes before we finally walked over to a waitress and asked for our bills because at that point we had realized that they weren't going to bring it themselves.  So although the food was good I probably won't return here as my experience was not a very good one."}
{"text":"Great new spot in Oakville, and they have the most important thing right so far and that is the Food! Service is crazy friendly and they know their menu. Even the manager stopped by to see if all was good. The Only little complaint is food comes out slow but that will get better with time. And like they say good food takes time. This place will be around for a while because of the food. Today I had the Harper burger and it was awesome and I highly recommend foodies to try it."}
{"text":"Has a nice atmosphere but the service was really slow. Was there on a Sunday evening, three in my party and it took a long time between sitting-drinks order-drinks-food order-food-clean up-dessert order-dessert. Food was ok but could definitely been served faster."}
{"text":"It's rare to find the level of service experienced here.  Whoever has trained and manages the staff has done an amazing job.  The food never disappoints as well.  I highly recommend Harpers for a casual dining experience with friends. Mike at the bar deserves special mention for his attentiveness."}
{"text":"We have been there twice now only because the layout is a sensory delight. I only wish the food would match.   At the prices charged it should be at least a four star and I have no idea why this has not been accomplished.   Given Harper's location huge success should be a no brainier, serving great food is choice my friends, You in?"}
{"text":"I would give this place five stars, but the loud music ruined the evening completely. On the surface, it seems like an excellent place to date and socialize: fabulous food, decent prices, great service. Given it was St. Patrick's day, that's excellent. However, the music and the ambiance was so obnoxiously loud that we could barely hear each other shouting from across the table. We moved to sit beside each other and so we could converse without straining our voices, which worked well enough at first. Later in the evening, though, when the live music started, the volume was so extreme that we couldn't hear each other at all without yelling directly into eachothers ears. When it began to give us headaches, sore ears, and lost voices, we resorted to sticking ripped up napkins in our ears and stopped talking to each other altogether.  At this point we felt it was necessary to leave, and thanks to the service, we did rather quickly. That said, my boyfriend even remarked that when he attended a Katy Perry concert 4 years ago he was not nearly as deafened as when we walked out of Harper's Landing."}
{"text":"We've tried Harpers Landing many times. It looked promising but I've been fairly disappointed in the overall experience.  Their recipes look good but the execution is often lacking. 3 out of 4 of the dinners I've had at Harpers, at least someones dinner was missing one of the described ingredients. I've also had a badly undercooked burger there once, was not even medium rare (which I do actually like). Didn't have any issues after eating it, but the texture wasn't great.  Brunch is definitely better than dinner. I've done it a few times and not had a bad meal at brunch. It's definitely what turns this from a 2 star to a 3 star review.  I would pass on going here for dinner, but the brunch is pretty good. For the price I'd expect better food execution. It's all being spent on the location and the overall swankiness of the place sadly."}
{"text":"I would give Harper's Landing a reluctant 3 - they were saved from a 2 star review by having actually good food.   I'm not a big fan of chain-style restaurants who also try and be night clubs, and harper's is a good example of that. Super loud music, semi scantily clad servers and hostesses, very dark - all while having families seated throughout the restaurant. It's just weird for me.  One thing I will say is that it's a huge restaurant and while it's nothing special in terms of set up (TVs at the bar, combination of lounge seating, tables, and high tops), it is well decorated. I'm a big fan of all the wood tables and the private dining room, both were beautiful.  When we arrived, the hostess informed us that it was a 30 min wait and recommended we go to the bar, which we did. She said it would be added to our bill. When our table became available, we brought out drinks and went to the hostess - who dragged us back to the bar to settle our tabs, and then back to the entrance, and then told us to wait while she found a manager to add it to our bill. I understand they are probably working out the kinks still,  but it was a bit ridiculous that we had to follow her around and were relieved when we made it to our table.  The thing about the menu is that it really didn't look that appealing. Usually I have to decide between a few options, but it was hard to just decide what I wanted. We decided to split the fish tacos and dry rub wings, and then I had the brisket burger with fries. All the food was delicious, especially the wings, but it all felt a little overpriced and not worth it. Something that really annoyed me is that the apps are all served in 3s, and they list the price of additional items individually - it's like a cash grab since they are aware they serve them in odd numbers making it difficult to split.   The Oakville crowd really seemed to love this place, so if you would define yourself within that group you might just love it. Me, not so much. Between the weird service, strange \"party\" atmosphere and the price, i don't think I will become a regular."}
{"text":"The patio is killer, the steak and Frites were amazing but the service in the patio was slow and unfriendly.  The table next to us was a mother and daughter and they left before ordering. The cloud cover made it a bit chilly but the service was colder. Service warmed up when the check was delivered. Maybe put more staff out there.  I'll still come back because the ambiance is the best and the food is consistently excellent."}
{"text":"Food was rubbish but bar was good 2nd time there in 7 days first time ok 2nd very poor food was shocking fish and chips not the best I know I'm English so standards high but that's comparing it to a fish and chip shop this is a restaurant so should be better also chicken curry very fatty my son wouldn't eat his. I may go back but food needs sorting before I pay top dollar again!"}
{"text":"Fresh and delicious drinks and food.   My blueberry margarita had fresh crushed blueberries. The salmon salad speaks for itself in my photo: the baby kale is so tender. The dressing had a touch of honey. Balanced and delicious.   My companions had tuna salad, and they finished their plate. Dessert was mascarpone cheesecake and mango Sobert. Combining it makes it like a mango cheesecake. Rich luxurious texture for the cheesecake balanced by the mango tartness. So good. Can't want to return!"}
{"text":"Been here twice. First time I was here was 2 years ago for a birthday and I don't remember the food tasting amazing.  Was here again last night for another birthday, and the food was mediocre.  Honestly, the food here is overpriced and it's really nothing special.  Yes, the lobster fettucine tastes good, but I feel like they just put mushroom soup and used that as their sauce...I mean I can get lobster fettucine else where for half the price.  Also, we had bought shots for the birthday celebrant and I mean $13 for a shot...that's pretty outrageous.  A lot of business people come here, so I can assume why it's so damn expensive.  This place was dimly lit, too dim might I add, but what restaurant isn't these days.  They also had a live band and a DJ there too which was great but it was just waaay too loud.  You couldn't even speak to the person next to you without yelling.  Our server was amazing, he's the only reason why I gave this place an extra star.  Trevor was super attentive and was just on the ball with everything.  I don't think anyone at the table had a problem with their order because he was just that great.  And because we were a larger group gratuity was already included.  My boyfriend gave him extra tip because, let's be real, he worked his a** off and totally deserved it!"}
{"text":"I LOVE this Place!!! Great Ambiance, Great Food, Fantastic Wine List and the Service was pretty Good too. It is on the Pricey Side, but worth it."}
{"text":"Since writing my review yesterday, Harpers Landing has been great about reaching out to learn about our experience.  Very impressive.  We will give them another try."}
{"text":"On Friday which happened to be St. Patrick's Day was my second time visiting Harpers Landing. Both times were in large groups and for birthday parties! My view is solely based on Friday's experience as my first encounter with Harpers Landing was over 2 years ago-so hard to remember all the details.  We advised them that we would be bringing a cake and what annoyed me was the fact that we were NOT told there would be a $2 per person cake cutting fee. It was somewhat disappointing as we were doing this as a kind gesture for the birthday girl and it's hard to absorb that cost when the group is so large, so we ended up having to charge everyone the $2 for the cake.  I enjoy the atmosphere and the layout of the facility. It's large, has different elements to it and is extremely spacious and well kept.   My friend and I decided to split an app and an entree. We went traditional and got the calamari and the Harpers Burger with fries. The calamari was way too breaded for my liking and didn't even taste like calamari. I joked that it tasted more like chicken fingers more than anything. The aioli was tasteful though and added a little kick to the \"calamari\".  The Harpers Burger was delicious. Meat was juicy and not dry. The bun was soft and made eating the burger easier. The house pickles were lovely and a great addition to the burger.  Overall, the service was OK. I don't remember the waitress really interacting with us, offering us options or making suggestions. I know our group was large but I would have thought a little bit more of an effort should I have been made.  They had a live band and dancers as entertainment for the night which was a lot of fun and a great treat!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere at this place is great and service has always been great. Recently visited with a friend and had the Steak Frites. When the meal came the steak was tough, I mean...20 chews didn't get it down to swallowing quality kind of tough. I talked to our waitress, Amanda, and right away she spoke to the manager and they corrected it. The second steak was delicious and tender. The food here has always been good and I was happy to see that they dealt with the issue super fast! I'd recommend this place for a hangout with good friends or co-workers. Lots of screens to watch sports and great outside seating area too!"}
{"text":"Honestly, I'm a big fan of the short tight skirts, it's not accompanied by snottiness or rudeness, 100% friendly and attentive staff. My partner and I have been here several times now, each time the manager has come by our table once, introduction, very friendly. Chit chatted about the new location, was open to suggestions, debate, structural criticism.  Now onto the food, I have twice ordered the landing salad, as I am vegetarian and picky, I am 100% in love with this salad, not over done, priced well, arranged beautifully, one of those salads you want to attempt to recreate at home.  To share we ordered the fungi pizza, in my opinion wasn't too heavy on the olive oil, which I appreciate."}
{"text":"Always a pleasant experience at Harper's in Oakville. Great location, go-to spot for sporting events or weekend drinks. Not ideal for last minute reservations... understandable 30-60 minute wait on Friday and Saturday nights. Would recommend the Sunday brunch, specifically the Oakville Benedict's and iconic Landing Cure."}
{"text":"First time I was here it seemed like a normal bar/restaurant, but I just went again this past Saturday and I loved the ambience and atmosphere. Love how the patio is open through the restaurant. Very open and spacious. Waited at the bar for a table. Was told it would be 30 mins, only ended up being 15 and got a nice seat close to the fireplace. Good service overall. Calamari was average, steak was cooked perfectly and fries were good, the ahi tuna was good but the salad that came with it was blah. Will definitely be back but only while the patio is open!"}
{"text":"Oakville!  The last vestige of civilization before you get outcasted into the deep world of the Ti-Cats, and Milton's \"Sports Complex.\"  Beautiful places by the lake and a picturesque downtown...er...which is dead by 9PM mid-week!  Zzzzz....snoring!  Let's hit a hip and happening place instead!  Made a Landing at Harpers - yeah...I know, kind of obvious eh?  Cheesy - which by the way the Pizza wasn't!  Spoiler Alert!  Did Harpers Landing hit my Trifecta - Great Food, Great Value, Great Service?  Nope.  But I will give extra points for Ambiance for places like this.  Maybe it was a Wednesday night and the B-Gamers were out.  This was not anything as my friends have sold the place to be.  I understand it's not the weekend, but don't diners that help pay the rent and staff mid-week get the A-Game too?  I'm being harsh but I did give them a second run at it.  Second time is the charm right?  Kitchen closed.  Ugh - (play ZONK music here!)  The food was mediocre on my first trip out.  My tip was to get the spiced olive oil because the pizza was dry and tasteless.  It was worthy of sending it back, but I didn't.  My bud's food wasn't anything special either.  Harpers is a nice place to hang out.  It's has vaulted ceilings that makes you want to look for the altar and the pews - and maybe get a confession in.  The mix of booths, high tables, communals, and low tables can accommodate anyone's seating preferences.  I bet the patio is fabulous in fair weather.  The bar is a bit small for such a large space.  The bartenders were carefully moving pass each other.  I was at the bar and service was king here, as value and food suffered on the ratings.  If the Third Time is the Charm, then I'll give it a run - maybe on Friday night to get the \"Vibe\" my \"Oak-villager\" buddy was bragging about.  BUT really, shouldn't places like these have an A-Game all the time?  3 for my experiences.  +.5 for the ambiance.  Cheers."}
{"text":"Always love the food, especially the stuffed meatball. The Steak Frites was fabulous.   Staff Is always helpful and friendly.   The Cheesecake is amazing, one of the best I've ever had.   Service is sometimes a slow but it's a nice place to hang out so it doesn't matter. Love it.   In the spring or fall, when it's slightly cooler it's nice to sit by the fire. In the summer, the patio is the best.  If you are looking for breakfast that is a little different, come here. Love the breakfast options. Just slightly different and unique and always delicious. For the longest time I only came here for breakfast and was excited when I discovered dinner is just as good.  It's loud here so hard to have good conversation sometimes but the ambiance is nice and the music is always good. There is a TV by the bar to watch sports. It's everything a nice restaurant should be. Just don't plan on a meeting or intimate conversation here.  Try the various different cocktails they offer, there are some good ones.  If you are hung over, their morning after Caesar is amazing and massive. Never seen anything like it and that alone is worth coming in for."}
{"text":"Had heard a lot about this place and surely it lived up to its name. Nice ambience, pleasantly smiling staff, and great food. I loved the experience. Will go there again. I tried their Moroccan chicken and it was 5 stars"}
