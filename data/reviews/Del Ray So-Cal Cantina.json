{"text":"Just had the huevos rancheros.  So fresh and delicious, including the rice - and I'm not a big fan of rice.   

just backed it up with the French toast. Seriously unbelievable.  Honestly one of the best breakfasts I've had in a long time."}
{"text":"Worst brunch place I've been to in a long time. The space feels like a cold dirty garage where a punk band practices; bland, basic, cold food; they don't even have jam or maple syrup; ketchup and hot sauce are homemade, which is great, but they are in grimy little bottles & taste gross; ok service, servers seemed new and awkward. I do not recommend this place, there are WAY better brunch places in TO."}
{"text":"The absolute best new little spot in Toronto. Super chill friendly atmosphere, great vibe and the food is really good if your needing a baha Mexican fix which is hard to get in Toronto!"}
