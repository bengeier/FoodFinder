{"text":"This place is beyond amazing. My boyfriend took me here for the first time a month ago. By far the best tacos ever..."}
{"text":"I was so happy to find this place! My Mom was in the hospital the day before and wanted some home cooking. This totally hit the spot. It seemed to be a little under staffed and I felt sorry for the cook and the front counter person, but both ladies did an awesome job! There appeared to be a steady stream of regulars. That's always a good sign in my opinion. The carnitas and horchetta were spot on....so good! :) I'll definitely come here again."}
{"text":"I had their adobada tacos with some pineapple. Hands down better than most taco places, probably the best I've had in all of Las Vegas. They told me they have another location on Fremont (I've seen it) but they swear the truck-stand has better food. It is located around a rough area, but nothing really to concerning. Just wouldn't recommend walking there alone at night (even tho I did). Just amazing. 5/5. I'm going back today."}
{"text":"One star is way to generous for this place ...horrible horrible  horrible. From service to their food.   3 dollar tacos not even meat but pure grease...don't waste your time or money here.  ...  but that's my opinion"}
{"text":"Best tacos and horchata I've had in Las Vegas! Staff are friendly and service is quick. There is no way we leave Vegas without first stopping by for dinner. Downside: Parking is limited."}
{"text":"Mal servicio supet caro y bien mal servido. Pedi una mulita me la dieron fria y mas bien parecia taco yni guacamole le pusieron. No vayan a comet alli."}
{"text":"Love this place!  We visit often. The employees are very nice and the food is great!  A true hidden treasure."}
{"text":"Bad customer service lady want you to buy another drink she said I don't give free refills. I will amend not bad presentation when it comes to the food but the meat as no flavor  and it's OVERCOOK and then the hot sauces isn't even HOT! The radishes that they have is cut too thin this to dry taste like paper \"FIRST TIME HERE NEVER COMING BACK!\""}
{"text":"Loved there Hawaiian torta worth every penny also the tacos are good and everything is fresh and clean worth coming"}
{"text":"great al pastor tacos, fast friendly and fresh, menu items look delicious, have not tried them for I love a good al pastor and these rock"}
{"text":"Nastiest tacos I ever eat ! They even got me sick it seems like they re-heat the tortillas they get all hard... I don't recommend this place at all!!!"}
{"text":"Horrible customer service I felt bad for even eating here the cashier and waitress were horrible they were so rude i didn't know if they were mad about life or mad at my family and I for eating there the cashier was just flat out rude and the waitress threw one of the plates on the table after she had already handed me every plate instead of putting them on the table but when i asked her to put the fourth one down she threw it on the table then the entire time we got constant dirty looks by the 3 employee women absolutely crazy we will definitely not be coming back the owner should consider hiring new employees with better Customer service"}
{"text":"if you've never been here. They provide the food, it's up to you to figure out where you're going to sit. Maybe it sounds weird but I really like stuff like that, especially when the food is worth it. Who knows what kind of person you might end up eating with, where they come from, what they do for a living."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! The Pastor meat here is by far the best I've ever had!!! Delicious tacos, love the salsas, and the condiments are fresh. Overall, great place to eat and employees are friendly"}
{"text":"For al Pastor, this is the place to go.  It should not be called al pastor if it is not sliced off the rotisserie with a pineapple on top and this place does it right.  They also automatically threw grilled Jalapenos and onions in the to go bag without me asking, big bonus."}
{"text":"Los tacos al pastor tienen muy buen sabor PEROOOO por $2.00 que cuestan c/u deberían traer mas carne, si de por si la tortilla es chiquita y luego le ponen MUY POCA carne. El servicio Déja también mucho que desear"}
{"text":"Best Pastor Tacos this side of the Border period!  I have tried to find good pastor tacos here in vegas for years, some that would be as good as the street tacos I had in Monterrey, Mexico every place has failed miserably except gordos tacos which are decent but not as good as these.  These matched the tacos I had in mexico, they also sell the \"Gringa\" taco which is the way many of the street vendors sell them in Monterrey, MX which is,:flour tortilla, white mexican cheese, lots of pastor meat, avacado slices.  I highly recommend the \"Gringa\" taco, it's big so one is usually enough.  In mexico they also sold one called a \"Campechana\"  which was exactly like a \"Gringa\" but it had pastor meat and bistec/steak meat mixed."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch thinking this would be a good place to have some tacos...  I chose 3 meats asada, tripas, and alpastor. Food came out in a timely fashion and I couldn't wait to dig in. On the same plate there was sautéed onions and a jalapeño but they were COLD not room temp but COLD! All 3 tacos were bland. Out of the 3 tacos the most disappointing taco was the al pasto. Very dry meat very little seasoning and topped with pineapples. Pineapples are optional but you would think they would sauté/cook them with the meat to carmalize then a little but no... pretty much just warmed up and topped on the taco. The salsa station was very disappointing really won't get much into details here, but me personally like radishes to partner up with my tacos let me just say they weren't very fresh...  Overall left the place very disappointed and still hungry I'm giving them 2 stars cause I managed to eat the food."}
{"text":"I always get the Carne Asada Plate, so yummy. They have a drive through which is great because it's fast and i've never waited in line. Unfortunately, the last time i ordered the carne asada was dry and the rice was cold ): Hopefully it was just bad timing."}
{"text":"Food was good properly seasoned clean atmosphere the staff was nice but way overpriced it's a taco not a burrito I think it's more expensive than El Gordo"}
{"text":"Good flavor! And moderate portions giving 4 stars because there are no spots to sit down and eat."}
{"text":"Never again on this place, the vegetables and sauce bar look like it was a week old and the cashier was unfriendly  I have always think that if you don't like your job, it's no ones fault,  Thank you"}
{"text":"A part of me wants to keep this spot a secret, but it is way too good not to share.  IMO, best tacos in Las Vegas, especially the pork.    Served on a street corner from a portable food cart.    This isn't the safest part of Las Vegas, but the food makes it worth the trip."}
{"text":"no more food frome this place food there sucks i got sicks after try chesburger with frise"}
{"text":"Mmmmm mm I was craving tacos late night! Thank you yelp for guiding me here. The meat is perfectly seasoned and the salsa!"}
{"text":"Brand new location by the Galleria mall. The food is super tasty just like their other locations and the staff was quite friendly."}
{"text":"Wow. Al pastor is amazing. Authentic and delicious tacos and salsas. Definitely going back tomorrow!"}
{"text":"The service was rude and they were a rip off. $2 per taco..6 small tacos for $12. The cashier wasn't courteous at all and I kept having to repeat what three different types of tacos I wanted.   Tacos weren't good at all...they had a condiment bar with flys all around. Not recommended at all, you're better off going to Taco Bell. BIG DISAPPOINTMENT!"}
{"text":"Food not that great and a bit expensive but what can you expect on Fremont  right.....costumer  service can use some help.."}
{"text":"We were in Vegas for a couple of days and found this taco wagon on yelp!!  Come and try this out. Best asada quesadilla EVER and we consider ourselves food truck foodies. Fast service great fixings you can add yourself. Excellent  ck it out u won't be sorry"}
{"text":"Food is excellent and a great value. The unassuming taco stand (off freeway Downtown) delivers the goods. The horchata is a little too sweet for me, but still drinkable. Service is speedy and you'll see a lot of customers hanging out. The neighborhood looks sketchy, but there are two police command stations within a half mile which keeps the order. The homeless along the boulevard do not disrupt the business.  Also, the taco stand is right off of the Cultural Corridor by the Cashman Center which means that you are close to everything (e.g. freeway, downtown, the Strip, Fremont Experience and North Las Vegas casinos).  I only wish they had somewhere to sit momentarily."}
{"text":"This is one of the best places if what you're craving is authentic taste. When in the mood for tacos Asada and Al Pastor are our favorite. Please add Piña- savory goodness! We've also ordered the Alambrado which is all their meats on one plate seasoned with the works and tortillas. Their salsas are very tasty and they have one for adventurous types which is super spicy. It's neon green. Their salsa bar also has limes, pickled onions, carrots cucumbers and cilantro, which is good for those picky eaters that don't want all the fixings to pick out. Every time I've been in here, place is clean, and staff is friendly. I don't understand why people hate on this place. Yea- it's not fancy, yeah-it's not cheap and the set up is funky as far as ordering. One comment talked about the small cups for the salsa- it's called a business- smart way to avoid wastefulness. Every time I wanted more Salsa- I got up and walked the 6 whole steps to get it. Winning. As far as prices- I get it $2 is steep for a taco, but they are quality, authentic and fresh. I'm happy for these guys and even happier to support a local business that started with a flat grill on Eastern and Bonanza when the sun went down. #tacosporvida"}
{"text":"Food is great. You can't go wrong with anything in the menu really. I highly recommend the buche it's very well prepared. The tables are however a bit small. Still somewhat of a new restaurant but worth to try."}
{"text":"Best buritto I had in years ! (Shrimp) it's clean.. tables have a bigass napkin holder.. they have can sodas available if you are not a premix fan. An a lot of ladies dining here that means something right ? :) good job"}
{"text":"By far my favorite taco spot. The prices are fair and the pastor is to die for. They always have your food out in an appropriate time. Open 24 hours, so you can fight your taco cravings anytime!!! Watch out for the green chunky salsa if you don't have a high heat tolerance. It is so Spivey!!!!! But of course in a good way."}
{"text":"I stopped here yesterday before the 51s game to get tailgating food. The al pastor and carne asada tacos have really great flavor. The Sinchronizada is a quesadilla-torta mashup with ham, lettuce, tomato, onion, pickled jalapeño and avocado. All the salsas and toppings seem really fresh. Don't be fooled by the parking lot ambiance, this is the perfect spot to stop for tacos and more."}
{"text":"I gave it two stars because the al pastor tacos were mehh..seasoned well but there was no cilantro or onions that came on them...the orange chile could have been better..i ordered the carne asada burrito for my boyfriend and it had alot of fat"}
{"text":"El dia de hoy fui a comprar 2 burritos al pastor  y ooh trizte decepcion ya no los hacen como antes mi burrito era mas bien de frijol jamas le encontre el sabor a la carne por tanto no hagan eso pleaseeee lo unico bueno son las personas que trabaja enfrente son muy amables"}
{"text":"Fell in love with tacos al pastor after a visit to Mexico City. Got a hankerin' for more and remember seeing this place when I go to the Meadows Mall.  Let me say that it is very close to authentic Mexican street food. We got 9 tacos al pastor and shared a carne asada fries.  It was all fantastic. The green salsa was very traditional as well. Can't wait to bring the wife here to remind us of our fantastic vacation in Mexico City."}
{"text":"Bombest tacos in town, hands down. CASH ONLY and the area is a little sketch at night so be prepared. Totally worth it."}
{"text":"Loved the pastor/pineapple combo. Confusing setup, but solid food. This place definitely exceeded expectations."}
{"text":"Good tacos good service! The only things I can say is that the tacos are plain and are not like the pictures with all the goodies on top so the tacos are expensive for getting plain ones.. also no refills on the drinks! And a drink is 3.00 and there is no refill price so you have to pay another $3 so it's kind of expensive to eat here. But the meat it's self is good"}
{"text":"Man this place is legit!  It's in a great location if you need to grab some food once you leave Fremont Street!  The food truck always has a line of people dying to get great Mexican food after midnight Friday or Saturday!  It's like theTacos El Gordo of downtown!  Easily accessible compared to Tacos El Gordo on the strip!  Also they have tortas and burritos!"}
{"text":"My experience was not the best. The food was okay, nothing special. The inside of this place was really dirty when I went, and there salsa cups are tiny!! I need 8 of them to equal a normal one. My boyfriend, however, really liked their food. Maybe it's just preference. It's average/fair priced. The workers were very friendly. I have no complaints in that regard. Because the food wasn't my favorite, I personally wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"This place is in the hood but it is a must try. Trust me I will buy you a meal somewhere else if I am lying to you . Yummy and I don't really care for Mexican food that much. But like I said a must try"}
{"text":"Went last night and the Food was amazing as always..going to get a couple more tacos right now for lunch"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try el buen pastor's tacos since they opened up their new location in Henderson. The tacos here are very tasty,  reasonably priced and their sauces are super good. The tacos are served up plain, so you have to add all of the fixings yourself which you'll find at their salsa bar."}
{"text":"Best al pastor tacos this side of the border, I grew up in Mexico, and I gotta tell you, is really hard to find authentic Mexican flavor.  I followed the advice of yelpers in the search for the best place for tacos, it was right on, so juicy, tasty, I'm going back for more.  It is a very short walk from Freemont, and I felt safe as well. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Just tacos, not too satisfy with the amount of meat for the price. Come with a grill jalapeño and caramelized onions which were freaking cold. I think tacos el compita are much better and cheaper!"}
{"text":"Excellent Taco Truck....Great Salsa Bar/Sauces....Perfect for late night munchies!!!"}
{"text":"Ate there last night. Very good and, although it feels like a large chain restaurant, still has things like Lengua and Cabeza.  One thing I didn't like was it seemed like there's only three types of burritos and I had to sp, ecial order a carne asada burrito and special order it wet. That being said it was soooo good! The rd sauce on my burrito was delicious and the carne asada meat was pretty good as well.  The service was great. The young girl that helped us was great and extremely happy to help us. My only real complaint is they don't allow tipping on the credit card so, unless you carry cash, you can't tip, which is what happened and it kinda ticked me off.  We'll definitely go back."}
{"text":"This place is in a very sketchy part of town and id always see it on my way home and was always curious to try it and after 2 years i finally did and all i can say is....wow did it blow my mind! to this day its still the best tacos ive ever had and the guys are always so nice."}
{"text":"Good authentic Mexican food (aren't they all?) The place is much cleaner and well decorated than most places and it makes it more inviting to eat and stay there. Prices are reasonable with many specialty drinks to chose from. Some of the food on the menu are not easy to find elsewhere and you will need a \"guide\" to try some the original things they have. I will definitely go back to try other choices, and bring a Mexican friend to try new things  :)"}
{"text":"The carne Assad's fries are so delicious. My girlfriend and I were waiting to ride slotzilla and decided we should probably grab something to eat while we wait. We ordered the carne asada fries and topped them with all three salsas. The results were heavenly!  We ended up eating here three times during our stay, and yes all three times we had carne asada fries. We also tried the al pastor tacos, and al pastor burrito. If you're looking for some tasty affordable food this is the place!"}
{"text":"Vegas's best tacos have a brand new location in Henderson! I first fell in love with Taqueria El Buen Pastor back on Las Vegas Blvd. and was so excited to hear that they decided to pop up shop here in Henderson. If you're looking for the same food truck experience with the convience of dining in this location is a must. As far as the food goes you cannot go wrong with any of the choices on the menu, and if you have any questions the staff in the front of the house are knowledgeable and can surly help you. If you love spicy food I would try the thick green salsa. And if you are looking for something to drink these lady's know how to make the freshest Horchata in Vegas. HANDS DOWN TAQUERIA EL BUEN PASTOR reigns over Vegas as the best taco stop in Vegas!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious. I'm a   Cali and these tacos were the real deal! Pastor tacos with pineapples cut off the stand are addictive! Carne Asada tacos were also also very tasty! Next time I need to try the burritos.  If you don't enjoy their food you don't know what real mexican food should taste like. Super satisfying and I highly recommend them."}
{"text":"The service was great. Those ladies at the front had on nothing but smiles.. Here's my rundown I had a to go order of tacos/quesadillas/huaraches all with al pastor/asada.  When I got home and opened my food I was reallly disappointed. The meat was sooo black on the asada and al pastor I didn't eat it.. These stingy folks seriously gave me some leftovers from the previous day. With so many taco shops you would think they would up their game.."}
{"text":"This very casual restaurant has the best food.  We loved the pork, steak, corn tortillas and guacamole."}
{"text":"Well well well Nelson, so you've done it again. You have found one of the most amazing hole in the wall joints in Las Vegas!! Big kudos to you. This is now my favorite place to get tacos anywhere in town, especially my favorite, the al pastor taco.  Unfortunately, I was not able to attend the UYE treks that Nelson put together due to work obligations. But after having these tacos, I probably should have used up all my sick days hehe. The only thing I regretted was taking such a long period of time to try these delectable morsels of flava'.  For parking, try to find a spot at the gas station or on the nearby streets. It can get kinda sketchy late at night so keep a lookout!  So I ordered three al pastor tacos with pineapple. First off, you know they are going to do things right when they use fresh pineapple. When the tacos came out, they were a great sized portion. Heading over to the sides station, I decided to try a different sauce on each taco. Added on cilantro and limes, and I was good to go.  That first bite... Forget about it. Forget about every al pastor taco you've had in your life. Because these guys? Yea, they know what's up. The smoky richness of the pork layered by the perfect blend of seasonings and spices. Trust me, you need to go here. The sauces? Amazing! Try some and find out which one you like!  In Nelson we trust! Great find!!"}
{"text":"The tacos were delicious, they lacked presentation and toppings. But to be fair they provided those a la cart. Pastor and asada are my personal favorites!"}
{"text":"I never remember to check in but I visit this place at least once a week, very good !!!! I'm always a little nervous trying food trucks because of the rumors you hear, but let me reassure you. It's AMAZING!!! Everything on the menu, especially the huarache con carne asada!!!!! So amazing ! It gets busy but well worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Lady that took my order is very friendly.  My carne asada taco is full of gristle.  Yuk."}
{"text":"Not bad bit the prices are pretty high for the food, you can get about the same amount of food in other places for less, the horchata has no refills and they charge 2.50 for a small cup, fountain soda for 2.19 for small size and it seams there is only one size. Food is not bad. I gave it 3 stars because of the food price."}
{"text":"This place has the best al pastor! We just ate here and man oh man! I'm not easily impressed normally but yummy! The customer service is awesome! They gave us a free taco to try because it was our first time. They have buy one get one free pastor tacos on Wednesday's. They only down side for me is they could have one salsa that is actually spicy. The salsa are good but not too spicy, I like a little heat with my tacos ;-)  My pic is before I dressed it up. They let you put however much cilantro and onion you want...."}
{"text":"to put it simply. when you are craving for tacos. this is a great spot to get that fix. pastor was marinated very well, pineapple with it is always good also, had the cabeza. taco truck in the hood, what more could you ask for."}
{"text":"I'm a California native and a Mexican food addict so I was stoked to find this place. Keep in mind the cashier doesn't speak English so you have to work with her a little bit to get your order. For $10 I got the biggest torta I've ever seen and the tastiest lengua taco I've ever eaten. It reminded me of being back home. A truck set up, people just gather around and eat authentic food for cheap and hang around until they are done. Don't expect dining chairs if you've never been here. They provide the food, it's up to you to figure out where you're going to sit. Maybe it sounds weird but I really like stuff like that, especially when the food is worth it. Who knows what kind of person you might end up eating with, where they come from, what they do for a living. If you're shy you can always eat by yourself in your car of course. In just the small amount of time I was there I saw a lot of different kinds of people all just hanging out and eating together. Really did make me feel like I was back home which I enjoyed almost as much as the food. It is the first time I've had shredded lengua, usually its chopped wherever I get it. It was super juicy and super tender which lets me know they can cook. I'll order more of those for sure next time."}
{"text":"Great pastor tacos!!!! Real pastor and with pineapple!! Mm mmm  2 for 1 tacos today with a great variety of salsas. Best of all they were very nice but take cash cause they have a $10 minimum for credit cards.  Either way we really loved the tacos and will be back for more!!"}
{"text":"Convenient 24/7 location for some late night tacos. It wouldn't be my choice for a random dinner taco spot, it is expensive. But it's good and rather stop here 10 times more than stand in a long line at tacos el gordo. This spot flavor is good, salsas are good, like I said expect to pay!!"}
{"text":"My friend ordered the carne asada and it was tough as rubber on the pavement. The place was dirty and the service was slow, you can definitely skip this one!"}
{"text":"I know that sadly this area is changing over the years but the Wendy's that was originally here should have probably stayed open. Heck the Arby's next door is only open until 10 at night so clearly the chains that have been here for decades aren't as busy as they once used to be. They need to work out how to order here at Taqueria El Buen Pastor. I walked in and they have a menu board that says \"express line\" under all the menu items which would lead anybody to believe that's where you order. I mean it was right there in plain English and I was still confused. I had to go over to a girl and give her my order and pay then wait for it to be brought out. I din't have any problem with that but come on don't plaster \"express line\" all across your menu board if that isn't where you order.   I got asada tacos and this place charged me .50 cents per taco to have flour tortillas instead of corn tortillas. WTF?! I know a lot of the chain restaurants do this but not usually these mom and pop type run places. I can go to Sinaloa (just down the street on Decatur near Lake Mead) and also Tacos El Gordo who both have the best tacos in town and they never charge me for wanting flour tortillas instead and even if they did, I'd gladly pay it because I know I'm getting a legit taco. The asada tacos here were way too fatty and overcooked. All I tasted was charred fatty meat. The tacos also only came with meat and tortilla so again I say WTF?! They do have a salsa bar but come on most places put onions and cilantro on the tacos at least! Just not my type of taco joint."}
{"text":"I normally hate al pastor meat but what first started out to be 1 taco ended up being 3. The men cooking were very nice and asked if we wanted pineapple in the meat mix, heck ya! Awesome awesome awesome street food and the crowd says it all. They also have lengua, asada, cabeza, and chorizo. The horchata drink hits the spot and no imitation powders used here. I highly recommend this stand $1.50 tacos anyone?"}
{"text":"Maybe they changed a bunch of stuff since the previous reviews.  The tacos were just kinda meh.  A bit too salty, a bit too dry. Still on the search for the ultimate east side taco stand."}
{"text":"Tacos de Cabeza are the BEST!!! So juicy and their salsas are fire!   They need to work on their time. They can be a little slow which can get irritating - that's the reason for the 3 stars."}
{"text":"The service here was so awesome and the girl who took our order was the sweetest server I have ever met. She gave us complementary tacos pastor which were BOMB!!!! So if you come here please come for those they are amazing just explodes in your mouth with flavor and the tortillas are handmade. I had the chicken flautas which were on the dry side and was okay and my friend had the Mexican scrambled eggs which were toooo spicy for him. I tried it and it was reallly spicy. But me and him are not really into spicy foods So if you like spicy scrambled eggs then get the huevos a la mexicana but personally I would recommend the tacos pastor. Omg so good."}
{"text":"We saw this place featured on the Travel Channel and The Zimmern List. Their taco pastor is really good and so was the chicken. Carne asada was kind of dry."}
{"text":"I don't know where all these good reviews are coming from. Must be drunk people that go in the middle of the night.  First off, they charged $8 for a carne asada burrito with just beans and meat (which tasted like dog food). I couldn't even eat it.  Second, I ordered al pastor tacos because that it what everyone raves about on the reviews. Mediocre at best. Also, the woman who took our order was incredibly rude. She called \"next\" so we stepped up to order. Then she proceeded to organize her cash register while we stood there for a good while. I understand that you may need a minute but at least look up and acknowledge us. I don't even care if its in spanish! I asked for flour tortillas and she told me it would be an additional $2 PER taco. Then all of a sudden she changed it to $2.15 out of nowhere. I'm sorry but $2.15 for a freakin flour tortilla on a street taco?! I'm pretty sure she just made that price up to discourage me from ordering it (which worked).   I got the orange colored hot sauce thinking it would be the hottest and put it on my tacos. Literally had to drench them in it to get any sort of flavor. It wasn't even hot. I was also surprised at how bland the meat was. It looks so delicious but definitely does not deliver.   All in all, I am very disappointed with the food as well as the rude service. And yes, I understand that this is a street vendor but I was hoping for more."}
{"text":"This has got to be the best taco place in Nevada. Everything is delicious and authentic!!  So glad they opened one in Henderson. I eat there every other day it's so good. Tacos al pastor are awesome!! The salsas very delicious and spicy.  I thought I would have to go to Mexico for some real tacos al pastor. Now I can stay here and enjoy my favorite food .  Thanks El Buen Pastor for coming to Henderson !!"}
{"text":"I've been to Tacos el Buen Pastor's food truck and their tacos are excellent. This although the same name are not the same. They are still better than most but nothing like the taco stand. I had their cheese quesadilla besides their tacos and it was good. But I tried their Huarache and man was that gross. I couldn't even finish it. Next time I want tacos I'll go the extra mile and go to their food truck this place needs to step it up."}
{"text":"Their cashier needs better training. Last time I was here I ordered 10 tacos because I wanted to try some of their other meats. Big mistake. Their only good menu item is their tacos al pastor. I ended up going back to order 4 more tacos to replace the shitty ones I didn't like. She told me I needed to order more in order to pay with my card. I nicely told her that I was just trying to replace the bad ones I got. She rudely told me that I should have brought them to her if they were so bad. I told her \"alright, I still have them in my car.\"  So I did. the tortillas were clearly burned. She replaced them with a super pissed attitude and I walked away wondering if they even wanted to be in business. What a rude woman. I wasn't even trying to get free tacos. I won't be going back here. I don't appreciate being treated badly especially in a place with only one good menu item. It's sad cause the cooks seem so nice. It's the cashier that will cost them customers. I will also stop recommending them to other people."}
{"text":"i placed a order for the enchiladas and a taco and i asked if it came with beans and rice and if not then i would like an order, and the total came to around $19.45, and when i got my food it came with beans and rice and a side so i asked the worker why she charged me, she stated that the combos come with beans and rice. so i asked why did't she explain that it came with it. she did not have an answer. when i received my food there was a pidgin walking around the restaurant and i told them there is a bird in her and the workers laughed. so needless to say i will jot be going back there."}
{"text":"Underwhelmed by the carne asada burrito- the limpest, saddest, messiest burrito I've had in a while. Menu description includes \"meat, cheese, beans, and sour cream\"- I only detected meat and an insane portion of beans. If your pinto beans are mostly liquid, they have no business being the main component of a burrito. Asada was either flavorless or simply overpowered by the beans- I will say that it had good texture though. Burrito overall was a disappointment. May return for some basic tacos but overall I was just really underwhelmed. Orange salsa is legit though."}
{"text":"Soooooo good and so friendly. Great condiments and easy to get to. Loved this place!  Will be back next time we're in town."}
{"text":"I was not pleased with this taco place, after waiting in drive thru for 15mins with only one car infront of me. I finally get my food and the torillas were cold and meat was dry. And tacos we're over priced will not return to eat here"}
{"text":"Yum Yum Yum Yum...........   I am from southern California and lived in San Francisco before Las Vegas and I have be fortunate enough to have eaten lots of amazing street food.   Since I moved  here 1 1/2 years ago I have been searching for great street tacos and I have finally found them.  The Al Pastor is not like any I have had before and all 3 salsa's were so delicious that I had to keep alternating to try each one with my tacos.  This was a fantastic you will never be disappointed Al Pastor.  I can't wait to pass on this hot spot to all my foodie friends.  I will for sure be back!"}
{"text":"Delicious tortas. Wonderful food and great customer service. So happy that we found this place."}
{"text":"The Best I've Found Yet.   The meat is good.  The Red Sauce is slammin, red chili with lascivious use of garlic but the Green Sauce steals the show. It has your standard tomatillas & jalapenos, but the garlic, lime and mint combo is on the same level of awesome as a midget stripper flying on the back of a unicorn yeilding a broadsword made of chupacabra teeth.   About the \"restaurant\"  You *must* contain the ability to eat your tacos while staring down anyone within a 35' radius because there will be zombie-like bums schlepping their way towards you while you wolf down what are probably the best damn tacos in Vegas.   I recommend you bring a hacksaw machete,  forged from the molten ore of deep-fryers from the land over Utah  and bathed in the tears of fast-food executives."}
{"text":"I'm a fan. Some hispanic friends straight up refuse to go to any other taco trucks, so convinced they are that this is the best spot in Vegas. I hadn't been in a while so I popped by after a game at Cashman. This spot is 24/7, and despite less workspace, put out better product than their brick and mortar restaurant a few blocks to the west.   The tacos are solid, with pliable, thick corn tortillas that are heated but not fried or oily. The lengua is good and the asada is smoky, but for a place named after the al pastor, that particular protein didn't blow me away. The quesadillas are huge and though it's hard to go wrong with chicken and cheese, it's one of my favorites. Always ask for their orange salsa-  it looks like it would be habanero-based but it has a lot of flavor and not a ton of spice. This is one of the few places I don't care for the house green salsa."}
{"text":"The place might not look good but don't go on the looks. Great tacos and burritos!!!! Try chicken and shrimp Travis!!! Super cheap and full of taste!!!"}
{"text":"Muy rica toda la comida!! Y el servicio excelente, muy recomendado sobretodo la birria y las tortas ahogadas:)"}
{"text":"The tripa tacos very good and the AL pastor too I wanted to try it out I always go to tacos el Gordo this place gives them compitition"}
{"text":"WTH Yelp? So all the reviews rave about this place, but none of y'all warned me that it was on the corner of ghetto blvd & sketch street!!   I mean,  don't be fooled by the rocks that I got, I'm still Brook from the block so I felt right at home. And the tacos are magic, the sauce is on point, and that fresh horchata was SO refreshing!   But I brought some friends here when we all were visiting Vegas for a bachelorette party and they were pretty uncomfortable because we weren't prepared for the neighborhood.   Would I come back? Yes- during the day time. With mace safely hidden in tow.   Would I bring tourists here again? No way. This place is a PERFECT taco truck; but it's no good if you're an out-of-towner that feels uncomfortable on new places."}
{"text":"I've traveled near and far to find an authentic Mexican taco stand  and when one finds herself/ himself on the east side, this place is a go-to must . Broken dialects, al pastor slow fired & charred to perfection, the subtle sweet from the pineapple then the slowly but surely intensity from the habaneros salsa( if it makes me sweat, I dig it ) I definitely left feeling some TYPE-OF-WAY. I don't know if it was primarily the salsa that had me sweating or looking at the beautiful array of meats and fixings ..Maybe pork is the new aphrodisiac ? I must admit that the best tacos/ burritos come from in fact a taco stand . Fast Forward.... Definitely order   AL Pastor Burrito - pineapple optional, al pastor ( sweet & spicy pork) rice and beans and all the lovings.  To quench your thirst like I did -Squirt or a Mexican bottled soda   Cheers !"}
{"text":"I'd come here everyday if I could but I live SW side and this place was literally on a random corner on the Eastside. (:"}
{"text":"Best Tacos by far that I've had in Vegas. Was referred by someone at Nuwu Dispensary & then my Uber driver on the way there even recommended it. & man it was AMAZING! Don't pass this spot up. Asada taste purely amazing & not dry. About to make my second trip in the same day lol"}
{"text":"Best tacos in Vegas  We will definitely be back !!had tacos de carne asada with guacamole !!"}
{"text":"Stopped by after kids basketball practice for the 2 fo 1 Al Pastor Tacos. They were pretty good if you add pineapple when you order. Salsa bar was a little weak on the salsas. There were only 3 choices and none were worth writing home about. Maybe give it a try again as they just opened not to long ago. The tacos at the original food truck location was a lot better"}
{"text":"This is best Mexican food in Henderson. The food just melts in your mouth because it's so delicious. And the price is very affordable. My knew favorite place!"}
{"text":"Average food at an above average price. Fast food restaurant, that charges fancy sit down restaurant prices. Menudo had no hominy. Tacos were good...But who doesn't make a good taco? The problem here is the price. At $2.50 a taco they are roughly a $1 more then most places. I personally didn't taste a difference.   The salsa was good, but they give you  the tiniest cups I've ever seen. Basically...Salsa enough for 1 taco. Everything is do it yourself. Won't come back."}
{"text":"Best food truck for tacos! I always pass this place going to work and wanted to try. Every time I drove by there were a bunch of cars. I now understand and will be waiting in line like the rest. There is a great selection and you can't beat the prices. I got the carne quesadilla. It was spectacular the way the meat and cheese melted together. Everyone should grab a quick bite from this little truck"}
{"text":"We won't return. Over priced. Carne asada was tough,  and was served in large strips, that I could barely bite through.  Forget trying to make a taco with it. Waste of time and money."}
{"text":"Came here on Tuesday November 11. I had the carnitas burrito which wasn't that good it needed more flavor, the cheese out did the taste of the meat. Also some of the fountain drinks were out of service."}
{"text":"Finally my ship has come in. I have lived, but not truly lived in Las Vegas for 15 years. Being a California transplant I took authentic Mexican food for granted, living in LV has shown me the error in doing so.  The food here is excellent. A Sterling reminder of Mexican food in the Bay Area.   You might say, but Johnny, there are a lot of Mexican restaurants in LV. There are. A lot. None of them capture the small hole in the wall authentic food I grew up with. Until now.   Please expand your menu, you're doing great!"}
{"text":"Best street tacos! Opened late, Good customer service ..they moved across the street."}
{"text":"Holy cow! Or rather HOLY BUEN AL PASTOR!!! Probably some of the best al pastor ive had in a really long time!   Walking in you're just overwhelmed with a smell that will make your mouth water. Seeing the pastor on the spit I had already made my decision. I was welcomed by the ladies working and wasn't treated less because I look white. Which is such a huge plus for me. Anyway, back to the food... I ordered 4 al pastor tacos con pina. They came out hot and SO DELICIOUS!!! I wish I could have ate more. I'm stuffed and very happy! Will be back again"}
{"text":"BEST taqueria spot in Las Vegas!! They always have great customer service and the food is delicious! The tacos de asada here are a prime example of what a taco de carne asada should taste like and the green salsa is amazing! Taqueria El Buen Pastor is a MUST!"}
{"text":"Very expensive, really disappointed on service. I ordered breakfast Huevos a la mexicana they were soggy and my agua de Fresca was like a medium size. None of the salsas where spicy. Just a big Disappointment"}
{"text":"We are repeat customers. Their food is delicious, and reasonably prices. Customer service is amazing which is hard to find in this area. Taco specials on Tuesday, Wednesday and Friday. Al Pastor on Wednesday's is the best!"}
{"text":"You'll have an okay (but probably disappointing) tasting meal in a somewhat messy cafe.  We dropped by on a Tuesday evening to try them out for dinner. There were some other customers there, but not many. The decor and ambience is typical of a taqueria type place. The service is friendly and prompt, but the general cleanliness of the place is lacking.  We had the carne asada plate and a selection of tacos. The tacos ranged from moderately good to mostly underwhelming. The $12 carne asada plate tasted like a $5 carne asada plate. Edible, but tasted like, \"Why bother?\"  All in all, there are many many MANY taquerias in town. Some of which are cheaper and offer tastier food than here."}
{"text":"Amazing taco place for those late night (or afternoon urges). Great flavors and sides to put on your plate as well. Only things I wasn't thrilled about  (and it's not really the vendors fault) was this homeless man behind me was swiping some of the cut up vegetables at the condiment station with his bare hands while he was waiting on his food. In sure it was a vary rare scenario (not many do this and it's a risk when getting food from a food truck) but worth mentioning since there are homeless that live in the area."}
{"text":"I love this place! I eat here at least once a week. Everything is amazing and they have the best street tacos ever!!"}
{"text":"Uggh this place was on Fremont Street and had a decent line. This is usually an indicator when you're looking for a late-night bite and not familiar with the area.  The condiment bar was unsanitary with people dipping their HAND into the fixins without using the utensils.  The prices for the tacos were cheap but not worth it. My chorizo taco was BURNED and sparse. This was a whim restaurant and womp womp we lost."}
{"text":"Man what can I say this food is good!! Drinking and eating, great place for all that late night cravings. Right on the walking path of Fremont street. Prices are on the money  no pun. Lol, the asada burritos are the bomb!"}
{"text":"I Love Tacos! I mean, I am from Southern California so I know a good taco or two. This is a new location so to be fair, I think they are still trying to work out a few things. I ordered Carne Asada and Al Pastor Tacos along with a Carne Asada burrito. The actual Carne Asada taco was bland, there was no flavor and it was overcooked. I opted to have the Al Pastor taco with pineapple and it was ok, a lot better than the carne asada. Flavor was good, perfectly cooked and pineapple was a nice touch. All my tacos were paired with their fresh avocado salsa which was my favorite. The burrito was a nice size but again, flavor was lacking. Horchata was too sweet and needed more ice. Food was as hot as it should have been but overall, I will go back later to try it again. The prices are high for what it is so just keep that in mind."}
{"text":"Ohh late night drunk spot how I love your cheap 2 dollar tacos. They are always on the money! Had the steak and pork tacos! Legit! I can't say that much about it then that as I am always faded going to this spot. It will definitely satisfy and put a good cap on your late night drunken rage... =)"}
{"text":"4.5*.  Finally went by here after driving past the truck at Decatur and Meadows forever.  The restaurant itself is due to open on Wed 10/08, but they are serving from the food truck in the parking lot.  The al pastor tacos were fresh and had huge chunks of pineapple in them, and the torta was ENORMOUS.  For $9, the tortas are a great deal and are loaded with meat, cheese, vegetable, avocado, etc.  The food was all fresh made, and great.  Cheap and tasty and always busy.  They also have a large variety of meats, some your more conventional and some the more adventurous, at least for American palates."}
{"text":"Their pineapple and pork tacos are delicious, they are a little pricey though. Only reason I gave them 4/5 stars"}
{"text":"Carnitas Sope is legit with green sauce. In downtown vegas, this is all I have had don't question it just order it!!"}
{"text":"So you an in Vegas and looking for a joint to get some grub.    Well this place has grub.  I wouldn't call it a destination but it will help fill the void in your belly when you are hungry.  Meh."}
{"text":"As much as I wish I hadn't had walked the sketchy section of Vegas Blvd. inbetween I-515 and Stewart Ave(where the sketchiness felt the worst, and this is coming from someone who has experienced enough sketchy neighborhoods in Chicago), I'll admit I never would've discovered this great hole in the wall taco stand otherwise. I ordered a pork taco, and it really hit the spot. So good, that I wish I had ordered 2 tacos, and got one different one for a 2nd one had I done that. I bet their quesadillas, burritos, and other items are pretty good, as well. They even had huaraches(sp?) on their menu, as well!  Too bad it's on the other side of I-515, and not a little closer to the Fremont St. area. Since this is a cheaper and more interesting alternative, to eating at pricier places closer to Fremont St. like Heart Attack Grill(had no interest in going there). I wouldn't mind coming back here, but next time I'll take the #113 bus to get here first, and take that bus to get back. There are #113 bus stops for northbound and southbound buses on this route immediately north of Bonanza Rd, btw."}
{"text":"Tacos El Pastor. Best taco I've ever had. YUM! Nice people running it, too."}
{"text":"Review coming from a black man. I find it disrespectful a lot of you are claiming they have the best tortas, best Cubana and that it's authentic I feel sorry for you claiming this is the best \"authentic\" place cause it's not all. The meat taste like it was frozen than thawed out tasteless food I can't cook but my al pastor taste better than this shit. it's like they got food out of a tv dinner and put it on display to serve."}
{"text":"4 months!!! That's how long they've been open here in Henderson and I've been missing out! Finally, as my cheat meal my son and I found this place on yelp and decided to give it a try since it was Cinco de Mayo.  Our order consisted of: -Nachos with cheese sauce and jalapeños: nothing special but exactly what we like! -Asada Quesadilla -Carne Asada Taco (grilled extra) -El Pastor Taco (w/out pineapple and grilled extra)  The carne Asada and El Pastor were one the best I've ever had especially grilled a little more on the crispy side. It was bursting with flavor. If you're craving for authentic tacos definitely give this place a try!"}
{"text":"I give this place 3 stars due to the dining area, it's really hard to try and find a place to sit if there's more than 10 people there so unless you're lucky you'll be standing. Other than that the food was AMAZING! Torts was well worth it and tacos were on point!"}
{"text":"We had already picked up gyros when we spotted this place, so on our first trip we only got the guacamole and chips.  My wife was loading up on the salsas when I reminded her we were only getting chips and guac.  This is why she is my wife.  The green sauce, the extra cilantro, and onions were all perfect compliments to the guac.  When I started eating it i was so glad she had loaded up.   I fell in love with the green hot sauce, it's spicy and very fresh tasting.    We had a variety of street tacos, the chicken flauta combo, and   chips and guac. All severed piping hot and very tasty.  We ended up going here three times over a three night stay on Freemont Street.  No matter where we are, if we're within 25 miles of this place we will be making the trip."}
{"text":"Best tacos in Vegas. Don't ever let anyone tell you differently. Always go pastor with extra pineapple and orange salsa. Also tip them, it's a million degrees outside they're still making bomb tacos! Go here- don't question it."}
{"text":"It's literally a hole in the wall.  The condiments where fresh and the food is delicious. I got a Torta Cubana and it was soooo good"}
{"text":"Let me start of by saying that this place is crazy if they think they can compare to tacos el gordo . Second of all it is 2x1 Thursday today and the lady charged me normal price for el pastor tacos . My bill came out to 11$ with a side .I get my tacos with pineapple and the pineapples are drier than Las Vegas dessert in the summer . Cool I pick them off then I take a bike of the el pastor tacos which they specialize in and the meat is dry also no juice . Hard and dry. I'm really upset , I was looking forward to trying this place out for the first time and it sucked ."}
{"text":"By far this is the worst taco place in Las Vegas not only do they have the worst customer service provided by ( Jannet!!!) Who's calls here self a manager while playing behind the counter with some guy spraying body spray all over him while people are eating 2 feet in front of her. And since we interrupted her play time we got all her attitude & even with her shitt face we still tried to order and even there food was bad so over cooked!!  meat tasted like it was a few days old! Just disgusting!!Definitely a big disappointment .  Ratings on this place should be a big F!!"}
{"text":"I was shocked that this place rated so low on Yelp.  This place is legit.  I love the authenticity of it all and I especially like that they do not tone down on the authenticity of the mexican taco to appeal to all crowds.  I ordered an Al pastor and Carnitas taco and was amazed by the flavor.  They also have a salsa bar that offers all the usual taco trimmings.  Their salsas are hot and spicy, just as they should be.  Anyone that enjoys an authentic taco will certainly love this place."}
{"text":"We were so very happy that our favorite taco-truck opened a physical location in Henderson!  Completely authentic Mexican food isn't that easy to come by in these parts, but here you will find it.  The Al Pastor tacos are to die for!  Note that on Wednesdays, tacos are half priced!  Even though this is about 5 miles from my work, I make the trek here at least once a week.  Funny that this replaced a failed Baja Fresh, but one visit and you'll know why.  If you like genuine Mexican fast food I don't think you can find a better place in Henderson."}
{"text":"WOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! THIS PLACE IS A GREAT NEW FIND.     I travel all over valley for food and this is definitely one of the best Al Pastor tacos in the valley. What made it great is it wasn't overseasoned or salty like  most places. It was perfect and cut into generous portions. They also have  a side cart with salsas and cucumbers slices, radishes, cilantro, etc..    They also have Carne Asada, Tongue, Chicken and Chorizo. If you looking for great tacos and great prices, this is the place."}
{"text":"There's is no other place better than a hole in the wall other than a food truck. If you see a food truck that's slinging tacos surrounded by a ton of mexicans,, you can bet you're gonna get the good stuff. The real authentic Mexican eats that you'll remember for life.  If you're that \"I love cheapotle\" type, please, don't embarrass yourself. Stay American amigo, trust me, they don't want you coming around here talking smack anyways. This is for the serious food trippers, definitely not for the chicken fingers and fried potato sticks people.  Forget the beef and the chicken (pollo) meat. Those meats are like the general tso's chicken of Mexican food. This is where they met the American tastebuds half way. Please order the Al Pastor, it's a much higher level of meat that's loved ALL OVER the WORLD. Yes sir, there is a world outside the USA and they don't prefer beef or chicken.   Lengua, Buche or Tripa is the good stuff. Trust me on that when I tell you. These are usually the good stuff that you don't eat everyday. It takes a special someone who knows what they're doing to make it really delicious. Someone sent to earth by God himself.   There's a condiment station next to the truck. There you'll pick up your onions, cilantro, the grilled jalapeños and onions. Get some sauce too,, green is tomatillo, red is Chipotle or sometimes tamarind. While sticking condiments in your baggie, you just can't stop but imagine all them good flavors mixing together and creating destruction in your mouth.  We should all eat in places like these. But not all food trucks are created equal, some are way better than others. This one, is the truth!!   Thank you Taqueria El Buen Pastor! Hasta Pronto mi hombre!"}
{"text":"I stopped by early Saturday morning before driving back to LA. Unfortunately they were out of tripe and tongue, so I ordered one taco each of chicken, asada, buche, and pastor. They were all very good and the salsas were delicious. The tacos were a little pricey, but they use regular size corn tortillas instead of the smaller taco sized tortillas. Overall, it's a great place for a quick bite and I will definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"Fantastic spot! Super clean and organized with a very friendly staff. Big downside is the price. Everything is expensive, but freakin' delicious. Kinda strange that their carne asada fries has nacho cheese and not the traditional shredded cheese. I would say that this place is worth the price, but unfortunately I cannot eat here as much as I'd like due to that problem. I would highly recommend checking this place out."}
{"text":"Thank you Yelp for telling me about this great new spot pretty much down the street from me. I love finding out about new places to Grub, especially if it's a good new Mexican joint. I know Finding some really good Mexican food is sometimes a challenge, thankfully it seemed that my search was over. I went during the lunch rush, it was great to see that even with a large crowd things were still running smoothly. The dining area was very clean and nicely organized, and the menu have a lot to choose from. The lady who took my order was very kind and the prices are quite reasonable. I opted for the three Taco plate which included chips for $10. The tacos were awesome, not that big but satisfied the hunger Beast. The carne asada was perfect not overcooked or Bland but just right and my chips we're nice and crispy without being over-salted grabbed some cups for my salsa and enjoyed my lunch meal in the car (don't judge me). Will gladly come by again to enjoy more goodness!"}
{"text":"Not to far from my house and I love their carne Asada fries. Everything is always fresh and the stuff are friendly. They have a drive thru which is great when I in a rush and hungry. Only downfall is that when I try to call and place an order for pick up no one speaks English and she hung up on me."}
{"text":"Got hungry walking around Fremont street and ran into this place. Got the al pastor and chorizo tacos. Both were flavorful and hit the spot. Nice char on the al pastor. Somewhat pricey at $2-$3 per taco but size was decent. I was good with 2. Salsa bar was okay. The only gripe is that the radish seemed old. Other than that, good experience with decent tacos. I wouldn't go out of my way to come here but I'd hit it up again for a late night snack."}
{"text":"Pretty good taco place we stopped at while walking around Freemont Street. Very fresh and inexpensive. This place opens early, which is a good thing if you're like me and not into breakfast food."}
{"text":"This place is dirty. The health inspector needs to shut this down asap. Also they sale these little street tacos at 3.00 a piece. Totally not worth that."}
{"text":"THEEEEEE BEST TACOS IN VEGAS!!!  Highly recommended!!  Especially late night!!  Food is simple and just plain AMAZING!!  Anytime someone mentions tacos this is the first place I recommend."}
{"text":"The food is alright but their customer service is horrible. I asked for carne Asada tacos and the lady brings me tacos de cabeza. When I went back to her about the tacos she said that's what I ordered. She continued to put the blame on me, even though I have never ever ordered tacos de cabeza in my entire life. I told her I would just pay the difference and then she has the nerve to yell to the cooks saying that I was the one who messed up the order. I got super annoyed because there were other customers eating and everyone could hear their comments. Very unprofessional."}
{"text":"Visited: June 17th, 2016. 3 am. After 12 hours at a work orientation. But we'll be back! Service: 3.5 stars  Food: 5 stars   The Good: It's fast, it's cheap, and it's everything tacos should be. Real tacos. Plus they added pineapples to my pork taco!  The Not As Good: It's all good.   Yes, yes, so much yes and there is really no other way to say it - it's everything I want a taco truck to be. Tacos should be survived out of small odd places, such as a taco truck located in a tire parking lot - check. You should be able to get tacos 24/7, at literally any time of day (especially in this city) - check. Tacos should be simple, small but filling, and all served on those foam looking plates - check. (Okay, maybe one day we'll do away with the plates for something compostable but for now ...) Tacos should be cheap - check. Tacos should come from a place that has the menu written in Spanish - check. Tacos should be so delicious - check.   Also, note that they had the condiments (is that what you call it) bar open so you could get your tacos and add all the goodies yourself, which I liked. And whatever sauce they had was bomb!"}
{"text":"My entire life I have refused to eat Mexican food do to the consistent raw hot inflated bowel movements. But one night I decided to try some street tacos at this food truck that seems to always be open. I tried pork beef chicken and I made a very rare discovery. That street tacos so authentic and so she can taste so amazing. I have never had Mexican food that left me satisfied full grateful and without an upset stomach. I refuse to eat anywhere else I will travel across town if I have to. I brag that this food truck has changed the Mexican food game for me and if I do happen to eat somewhere else I'm always comparing the food to theirs and everyone always loses. The rice milk is on point. In cold weather there is a space heater. There are always cold drinks and very good customer service.  Do I recommend this food truck ? Hell mother bleeping bleep I do!!!"}
{"text":"I came by on a Tuesday for lunch. The corner truck appeared to be completely abandoned. I think they are out of business."}
{"text":"My favorite pastor taco ever. I haven't tried this location but hopefully it's consistent with the amazing taco cart right up the street"}
{"text":"This place is one of the few things I love about Vegas. The one on Fremont street is a little more expensive than food truck they run about a mile north of here, but the quality and speed are just like in Mexico (thats a compliment!). I come to Fremont street just for their tacos...  And they dont mind if you bring in a beer from outside, just keep it discreet."}
{"text":"Best Tacos In Vegas !! Highly Recommend  You wont be dissapointed On wednesday they have their 2 for 1 special on the pastor tacos"}
{"text":"Tacos r the juiciest I have ever had. We walked and found them and it was delicious!,,,, omg...beyond delicious, good onions too.man yummy goodness. Great tacos."}
{"text":"This place was once of the worst places I have ever been too !! And I don't say that very often !! I went in there with my family after an event ... And we ordered some tacos and while we were ordering he yells at the cashier no more of those tacos because the guy behind them already ordered them and there is no more Of that meat. The cashier tells him well I'm sorry but she was here first and I'm giving them to her! Once our name was called we had also ordered a torta and they charge $9.00 and they put hardly any meat and 1 piece of lettuce nothing else . I go ahead and bring it up to the cashier and she asks to please have it remade the guy opened the Torta and stuffed it mad and put tons of meat in it and threw back on shelf .. It was so nasty you can tell they made all of our food in a bad manner !! When you are in this business they should welcome all comments good or bad. And they should try and fix the problem and argue with customer . And while we are paying for food that was disgusting the cook is now arguing with another customer over some tacos that were given wrong. I gave the cashier the torta only gave it 2 bites. It was so nasty but even then we paid for it!!! Yes even tho all our food was nasty we still paid for it, why because we were not looking for free food we wanted good food ! And this place is the worst:/"}
{"text":"They gave more old el Pastore tacos leftover from last night ask them they can cut it for us she said they haven't cooked any today it's 3 o'clock lunch time I guess it's because it's two-for-one Wednesday special I'm only going to Tacos El Gordo from now on where it's always fresh they told me I had to wait 30 minutes if I want fresh so they can start cooking it"}
{"text":"Awesome food and great service finally a taco joint in Las Vegas with zero flaws congrats to the owners"}
{"text":"Overrated. Don't even offer flour tortillas and they have $10 minimum for using a card. They want $2.75 for a bottled Coke which is absurd."}
{"text":"Homemade tortillas and large portions. Cleanliness and delicious food. What more can you ask for? Ive had the torta, which is huge, and it was good. I also had hievos revuelto with chorizo and that was the best breakfast ive had eating out! Definitely a must-try!"}
{"text":"After passing by this place for the past few months while the 95N connector has been closed, I finally stopped in. This is a very basic fast food style Mexican restaurant. Nothing bad about that, I come to expect that places like this are better than fancy schmancy, upscale.  But, I wasn't all that bowled over. The pastor was dry and had little flavor which surprised me especially having the el pastor in their name. One would think it would be one of the best ever had. What a disappointment. But their lengua helped me get over the el pastor. Tasty, tender and yummy. The best thing about my meager meal. The last part of my meal was a Taco el dorado. Sounded extra yummy.  A deep fried taco with potato and pork cracklings. Sounded like something really yummy. I was saddened by what I got. An orange-y textured sauce adorned the 3 tacos, the sauce was very bland to say the least. I bit into the taco and found mashed potatoes and very little, to nothing else. A  fried, mashed potato empanada, is more the description of this dish. What an utter disappointment."}
{"text":"Yawn over priced. I had carne asada tacos and flautas. All greasy all bad. Menu was very confusing. All designed to up sale you to death. Our order for three people to eat was 50 dollars way to much for what it was. I would not go back."}
{"text":"So me and my wife decided to stop by here for lunch because we both wanted birria and we both got big plates and 4 tacos, tacos where good. When we got to the plate of birria my wife was eating about half way done she found a hair in her food, totally disgusting to the point she was nearly throwing up. And btw the birria was old the girl I asked how often they made it had no clue and the other girl said they make it daily, complete lie, being Hispanic and eating Hispanic food on a daily you know when something is fresh and when something isn't, tasted like metal and the meat had a weird taste to it as well. Last time I will go there."}
{"text":"The very best taco truck around, inside or outside of Las Vegas.  You have to love the long lines, but these tacos are worth endangering your life.  You'll see lol"}
{"text":"These were the best tacos and torta we had ever! The meat was so delicious and tender! Definitely would drive a few hours from AZ for some more!"}
{"text":"Ordered tacos, between the four of us we had pastor, asada, and lengua. The meats were all delicious the only thing I would recommend would be better tortillas because they were dry and falling apart. Each taco is made with two tortillas so I just took one out so that I could better enjoy my tacos. I like that they're open late and staff is friendly. Oh I also like that they give you the choice to add in pineapple to the pastor :)"}
{"text":"This place is a rip off!!!! I went there for the first time a couple months ago and had some amazing tacos they were served fast and they were delicious and affordable, so I decided to go tonight after two long softball games, I was hungry!!! So first of all i get there and there's maybe 7 people in line, no big deal i get  directed to park in one of the few spaces they have and couldn't even pull in all the way because of the family of 12 in their lawn chairs like they're in their front yard!! So my wife gets out and waits in line (which took her  15 minutes to get through by the way) As i sat in our car the six kids,who were with the party that thought it was a camping ground, kept touching leaning and basically treating my car like it was their personal jungle gym!! After three or four times I finally  got fed up and rolled my window down and  yelled at them to get off my car, finally the mother who was feet away the whole time decides to control her offspring. I looked in the rear view mirror just in time to see my wife finally getting our two burritos we ordered, we got our food after the six or seven people who were BEHIND HER in line!!!! Wtf!!! She gets in the car and tells me it was $18 for two carne asada burritos!!! I'm thinking they better be hella good! So we get home and  begin to eat, I bs you not there was maybe a tablespoon of meat!!!!! For 18 freaking dollars!!! Never again it was all beans and rice no meat at all!!"}
{"text":"We are so happy that this place opened up! We have been loyal customers at it's other locations but this one is now a few minutes away from our house. This location is always clean and the staff is always friendly. The food has never been a let down(we are completely guilty of eating multiple times a week, sometimes multiple times a day) We definitely have our personal favorites being the green salsa chilaquiles, the tacos and the burritos. Their star is their chunky green salsa, amazing flavor. Definitely recommend at least trying this place. As a heads up, their specials are two for one tortas ahogadas on Tuesday, two for one tacos al pastor on Wednesday and two for one chicken tacos on Thursday."}
{"text":"HOLY CRAP!  After my volunteer shift at The Neon Museum I was heading back home when I noticed their trailer opening, I decided to check them out after hearing good things about their tacos, let's say they did not disappoint.  My first plate was 2 El Pastor, 1 Asada, and 1 Chorizo taco.  The chef cooked them up in a hurry and before long I was standing over a plate of awesome. The Chrosizo was good, a nice little kick but not too much spice. The Asada was probably my least favorite, it was good, but out done by the other tacos. The El Pastor Tacos were INSANE, seriously I asked how much for me to take the entire roast off the spit.  The fixings/toppings bar was nice, I went with only a splash of lime, but the salsas and other options were all fresh and everyone trying them seemed to like the offerings.  After Plate one I knew there needed to be Plate 2, so I ordered up 3 more El Pastor and 1 Lingua. The Lingua was really good (probably my 2nd favorite to the El pastor).    So in the end I had 8 tacos, I probably could have had another plate, but I needed to get going. I can say I will be eating there again, it'll be a great place to grab lunch after my shifts at the Neon Museum.  Oh I also forgot the tacos are $1.50 each, they come on top of 2 tortillas, and are served with only meat and tortilla, there is a bar you can add salsa/veggies if you want, but I kept mine simple"}
{"text":"OMG, just had the Al Pastor tacos today.  Amazing.  I cant even begin to describe how good they are.  There is a sauce on the salsa bar that is kind of a salmon color.  I honestly could drink it.  Five stars isnt even enough!"}
{"text":"I'm a taco  fun an once in while I go to a different taqueria to see if they are better than my favorite taco shop. They have a huge menu, which to me it means you can't be good at everything. The cashier completely rude, the way she told us we have to wait for our drinks was very rude. We have asada tacos completely flavorless and meat super dry. The only good thing was they have a salsa bar with three different types of salsa, cucumbers, radishes, onions and cilantro and limes. Other than that unless I'm completely drunk I'll come back."}
{"text":"I've been watching this place for months and months with a opening soon sign. It's close to work so I was looking forward to it opening, operative word \"was\". Well it finally opened and I went to try it.  I ordered a carne asada burrito. It was asada, beans, cheese and I beleive sour cream according to the description. I liked the ratio, mostly meat with a few beans, could have used more cheese.  I took a bite and it was like getting a gulp of ocean water it was so salty. If you're on a low sodium diet, stay away. It took the hotter sauces to mask the salt, which also masked the flavor of the ingredients, which was insignificant, since the only flavor was salt.  The texture was fine, no grizzly pieces of meat to chew through, but the overwhelming salt taste ruined it. Except for the calorie intake, I could have gotten as much taste enjoyment out of eating a salt packet.  They have other meats available, they might be fine, I don't know, nor will I know, I won't be back. If I might suggest, directly across the street is Cardenas market, they have a cocina in the store with excellent food, I would recommend going there."}
{"text":"The food is pretty average, but pretty expensive for what was charged which is like if it is a sit down restaurant. There is only a salt shaker and had to ask for pepper. The home made tortillas are a plus and their menudo has no hominy. The salsa bar has tiny plastic cups for salsa which can be used for one taco only. It wasn't so bad but not worth the money for what you are getting, Roberto's and Pepe's tacos are just as good without the extra expenses. I do not recommend this place."}
{"text":"Best tacos in Las Vegas hands down! You though tacos el gordo or taco y taco were good? Then you need to be here. Perfect for the picky eaters who don't like too many ingredients because the meat itself is extremely satisfying. I honestly cannot get enough of these tacos."}
{"text":"Want authentic DF tacos? well this is the place! They cook the al pastor stacked up on a rotating spit and you eat your tacos standing up. The salsas are are excellent along with all the other condiments you would expect like sliced radishes, cilantro and unions. I had the al pastor the lengua (tongue). The pastor was great! juicy and crunchy at the same time. The lengua was ok as the shred their lengua and i prefer it  cubed. 4 tacos and a water was $8 which seems a bit pricey to me hence why i didn't give it 5 stars."}
{"text":"Great Mexican food ! Very clean and with lots of flavor. The only problem is the parking space. There is barely a place to park and because of the heat it was very uncomfortable to eat standing up. They need to find an space with lots of parking or a front store building."}
{"text":"Their tacos are amazing and their customer service yes it's great but it could be better but over all. This is a great place for tacos great seas one meats and love their salsa but like I said it's a great whole it the wall"}
{"text":"Estos tacos son La Boma Caundo handas en Las Vegas downtown y LA gente muy ambile good people   When in downtown Las Vegas these tacos are the BOMBA"}
{"text":"Went there for tacos and I found really damn good tacos. I ordered tacos am pastor, lengua, and chicken so good!! The salsa bar is fully stocked and delicious. The horchata was very refreshing and the line moved fast! This is my new taco spot!"}
{"text":"Hands down best tacos I've ever had. Stayed at the Strat from 8/13/16-8/20/16 and I ate the pastor tacos and chicken quesadilla every single night!  SOMEONE PLEASE ANSWER THIS QUESTION THO - the green sauce that wasn't liquid like the verde, it was more of an applesauce consistency, WHAT IS THIS CALLED?  And is it possible to order it straight from this vendor?  I've never had anything like it and it's THE BEST accompaniment to tacos -PERIOD!"}
{"text":"THEY MOVED!!!!! They are at the same intersection, but KITTY CORNER to the original location. BEWARE: there's a new taco stand in the old location and they are NOT the same. We asked the new truck in the old location if this was the same truck and she was trying to convince us it was- IT'S NOT!   They are actually opening a restaurant in the parking lot that they are in now so be on the lookout for a full restaurant opening.   Best tacos around. Just make sure you go to the NEW LOCATION!"}
{"text":"This place has pretty good food most of the time but the service sucks the people here all have attitudes and act like they're getting paid $2 an hour or someone's twisting their arms to be here I don't know about you but I don't want those kind of people cooking my food"}
{"text":"The Buche tacos were made different but was still good. The al pastor tacos was the best i've had in a long time. The carne asada tacos was perfectly seasoned but a bit over cooked. I love the assortments of toppings and spicy chilies/sauces you can add on your food."}
{"text":"I teetered between 2 and 3 stars...went with 3 because the tacos were tasty. However I felt they were a bit overpriced for what you got. Never a fan of places that put a min on credit/debit. $10 min asada tacos were fair...better than Roberto's but nothing you can't get on the east side. The al pastor ones were better.  Overall..nothing to write home about with so many other taco places in Vegas."}
{"text":"These are the best tacos al pastor I have ever had! The taquerias I normally go to in Santa Ana are a little bit cheaper, but this place has the flavor to back up the price! Also they put piña on their tacos! I would have never thought to put pineapple on street tacos, but it was magical! Definitely recommend to everyone!!!"}
{"text":"what can I say! I think I found my Mexican spot of course my favorite was the taco de Lengua then the chorizo the pastor was not to bad but I will definitely be coming back although its a bit over price the tacos are not small very feeling they have variety of food and it just opened!"}
{"text":"Yummy!! Love parking lot tacos...something extra delicious about the gritty setting..."}
{"text":"El buen is muy bien!  Not in the greatest part of the city, and for some reason, I always get weird ass stares from random ass people. Regardless, this place is currently my favorite taco spot in Vegas. I usually go to El Gordo, but this taco truck gives them a run for their money. I've only tried their carne asada and al pastor tacos, but damn, it's some of the best I've ever had! And that spicy, chunky green salsa and their orange salsa are game changers! I don't even wanna try anything else, because they do the carne asada and al pastor (my favs) so well.   Can't wait til my next visit!"}
{"text":"Giving one star because the food was not good. Tacos al pastor tasted like it was old meat reheated even though they have the \"trompo\" of meat. The salsa was watery and the carrots also tasted old. The buche tacos tasted off. Not sure if this is because its new but the staff was very unorganized. They only had one cook so it was Saturday night and busy. The cashier and helper were just talking instead of helping customers who walked in. Lastly it smelled like sewage in the dinning area close to the bathrooms, we had to move tables. I might be biased because I go to the food truck they have on Las Vegas blvd and Bonanza, where they have two cooks and the wait is less despite it being a busy food truck. Who knows maybe they'll improve but this was my experience."}
{"text":"Was there on 05/07/2016  After having drinks from D bar and waking and looking around we got hungry, we decided to grab some tacos. They're good pastor for me and beef for my wife, the sauces are really good too.   Then headed for more drinks - Vegas life"}
{"text":"If I could give -5 stars I would. They lose all their stars. Worst experience of my life tonight. Sat at the drive through for about 40 mins which wouldn't have bugged me so bad if they actually got my order right. I asked for al pastor and they gave me carnitas which is absolutely disgusting. Asked for pineapple on tacos and did not get them. Chips were stale. Do yourself a favor and skip this mess."}
{"text":"Got 2 tacos de al pastor and 2 of carne asada my favorite was the al pastor with the pineapple. The asada were alright but not that great, the horchata was alright to nothing toooo big. The al pastor tacos were just on point, I think I have found my place for tacos de al pastor."}
{"text":"They are finally open! When I saw this place open up, I was so amped. I live down the street so I don't have to drive out to their other locations.  When we walked in, the lady at the front asked us if we would like to try their \"special\" which was the al pastor tacos. I thought she was asking if we wanted to order al pastor tacos so I said yes. She quickly ran to the back and ended up giving us two full sized al pastor tacos to sample... that definitely took me by surprise.   The gf and I ended up ordering 4 carne, 4 al pastor, 2 pollo, and 2 lengua tacos. All their tacos were so good! I am going to go out on a limb and say that they probably have the best tacos that I've tried in LV. They also have the salsa bar on the side with all the cilantro, onion, lime, orange sauce, and green sauce your heart desires. Watch out for the green sauce, it has quite the kick.   As we were leaving, the lady told us that they will have \"Buy one, get one free\" for tortas on Tuesday, pork on Wednesday, and pollo on Thursdays."}
{"text":"Always friendly. I enjoy the do it yourself toppings option. Great deals and specials too."}
{"text":"La comida bien nada mas la cajera  como q nesecita. Secretaria para q le. Conteste el cell y pueda. Atender. A los clientes"}
{"text":"Delicious Mexican Food.... perfect after a bit to many Tequilas.  We had the huaraches, carne asada plate, carne asada tacos, carne asada cheese fries and a quesadilla. Yes, we ordered way to much but it was all good. Their salsas were very tasty, none were to spicy. Definitely going to go back on our next trip to Las Vegas, it felt like home cooking when the hotel food gets to be to bland."}
{"text":"Tried the asada tacos and am completely satisfied. They are seasoned so well. I would suggest taking a bite before adding salt because its pretty flavorful. My onllllly wish is that the red sauce had more of a kick, but it still tasted great. So glad I found this spot."}
{"text":"Bomb! Tacos de asada were so flavorable. &the lady at the counter was so friendly and helpful.  So happy to have a taqueria in Henderson!"}
{"text":"Best Tacos in town with best ever salsa bar. Clean and hot fresh food. The ordering process seems confusing as we watched people walking over to what appears to be an express aisle so not sure they put those signs there when ordering is at the counter.  Keeping my tops for Tacos place."}
{"text":"Their tacos al pastor are great, I like the salsas and condiments, great for take out!"}
{"text":"Bomb! Taco truck.. My family and I are visiting out of state and where going to go to Tacos el Gordo but after seeing that spot ridiculously packed, we decided to leave, way to crowded.. Came across this hidden jem! So glad we came here super good, the tortas are huge and delicious and the tacos are finger licking good, salsas are amazing. Great food at a reasonable price! Definitely coming here again when in town!"}
{"text":"Snaps!!! A hop, skip, and a jump away from the jobby job!!! Thank you Mikey elite for bringing me here.  This taco stand is on the south east corner of Bonanza and Las Vegas blvd. Grimey.  Cheap eats at this taco stand. $1.50 tacos has me coming back for more every time I hit the spaghetti bowl. Cuatros tacos is enough to scratch my itch.   So far the asada and pastor tacos are the business.  They only give you the meat & tortillas. You can stack all the makings of cilantro, onions, and hot sauce on your tacos. Their \"hot sauce\" sets this place on fiyah! It's not too hot, but the after taste lingers in your grill for a good minute.  EYE LIKA!!!  If you're in the spaghetti bowl/downtown area and got that taco itch, Tacos El Pastorcito is the way to go."}
{"text":"Called before I stopped by to confirm it was still 2x1 tacos. Unfortunately after I got to the taco stand and actually ordered is when I was told it was only for the al pastor tacos. Bummer. I switched up my order and took it home. Tacos were pretty small. Flavor was alright, but the meat has a little too much gristle for my liking."}
{"text":"Broken promises, 1pm must be a bad time to grab some pastor tacos. It was already off the skewer and in the pan. Definitely had better tacos that weren't even pastor ."}
{"text":"Eh, it was decent. Do yourself a favor and go to the original spot on Las Vegas Blvd. they're better served and less expensive. I'm guessing the price is higher here due to having to pay high rent being on Fremont St."}
{"text":"Food was good but I can't allow myself to give it 5 stars because their prices were outrageous.. But hey I guess that's the price you pay when you have a Mexican food craving and on Fremont street.."}
{"text":"Some people call this place average, they are wrong. I hail from Southern Cali, and we're as authentic as it gets without traveling south of the border. Taqueria has many options to choose from, and they are delicious. Their food is well seasoned and they offer some of the tastiest sauces I've ever had in this town. In addition, their carne asada fries, although not really a Mexican staple, is the best in vegas!"}
{"text":"So good. Was recommended by a friend and I have to say that I'm glad I am walking distance from these delicious tacos. Legit tacos not the Taco Bell shit"}
{"text":"Our first time here and it smells delicious , let's give it them a try, a coworker said food is amazing we are having torta ahogada, torta de milanesa , tacos and burritos , food is here and I absolutely LOVE IT!!! Portions are big with reasonable prices;) come and check them out."}
{"text":"Ordered al pastor and asada tacos, to go, from the drive thru but I wasn't able to sit and eat right away bc I had to take a call. Anyhow, I had to reheat my food and I'm impressed with how good it still tasted! They packed the onion, cilantro and salsa separately which is great bc the tortilla doesn't get soggy and the veggies stay fresh! They also included lime in my order. Will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"I've been to many of the Taqueria El Buen Pastor spots here in Las Vegas, and this one is the BEST by far! I don't live close at all but I make the drive. Love that it's open all the time. Favorite taco spot & I think I'm kind of a taco snob. It's always clean too & it's really impressive for it being a taco truck. The cashiers are always very nice."}
{"text":"One of my favorite taco places in town  The carneasada fries are good, love the al pastor tacos with pineapple! And the Cuban torta is delicious too! Is hard to decide what I'm in the mood for when I come here cause everything so good."}
{"text":"TACOS AL PASTOR WITH PINEAPPLE, ONION, CILANTRO AND THE ORANGE SALSA BOOM! Thank me later. Of course I stumbled onto this little taco cart after a night of partying downtown a few years ago and now I'll drive across town for a taco. It's on the corner in the parking lot of a tire shop and the parking can be crazy but who cares. The juiciest, most flavorful al pastor I've ever tried. I could drink their orange salsa it's so good. Make sure you scarf down your tacos in the parking lot because you'll go back to buy a couple of more, trust me!"}
{"text":"I stopped by here for dinner and wasn't impressed. At first, I was standing in front of the al pastor because the menu above says \"Express Line\" under each description, so I naturally stood where it said the express line for the al pastor was. Then an employee came over and told us to order with her at another area. They really need to put up the signs better because it's confusing. If I'd been here before I'd know, but being this was my first time, I had no idea and just went with what the menu said.   The lady who took my order was very nice and the inside appeared clean. I have to say the salsa/veggie bar is larger here than at most places with more of a variety. Our food was to-go, so we stood near the supposed \"Express Line\" and waited for our order to be up. I thought it was strange that the whole time I was there the al pastor on the spit wasn't turned on. No spinning meat, just meat there on the spit. I also never saw anybody carve any meat off for the tacos I ordered.   Al Pastor Taco ($2) - Just meat, tortilla and if you'd like they will add pineapple at no charge. This was just bad. I only took 2 bites and then couldn't eat anymore. Some of the al pastor was so badly charred and the parts that weren't had zero flavor. They don't even out onions and cilantro on them! I kinda thought that was crazy to be honest. The menu shows what the tacos look like and they have onions and cilantro on them. If the meat and tortilla were good enough, it wouldn't even need anything else, but this wasn't anything tasty and I'd bet money the corn tortillas on my tacos came from a grocery store and weren't made on site.   \"Ranchero Al Pastor Taco\" ($3.50) - This taco has al pastor, beans, sour cream, guacamole and cheese. The toppings saved me on this taco. While I only found one glob of melted cheese, the beans, sour cream and guacamole had good flavor. Those toppings helped me get the taco down thank goodness because that first taco just wasn't edible.   Hubby had asada tacos and I tried a bite and spit it right back out because it was gristle. I wasn't happy with the overall taste of my food and can't see returning."}
{"text":"Legit!!!! Kinda pricey but we'll worth it. 5 tacos will set you back $10. A burrito is like $8-9. Get the orange salsa. Tastebud heaven!!!!"}
{"text":"Avoid the guacamole at all cost ! It's a rip off , such a shame because their pastor meat it's pretty good but overshadows the rest of the experience. I"}
{"text":"Excellent al pastor tacos with pina. I only wish they had more aguas besides horchata although its good."}
{"text":"NO HORCHATA!! Rude customer service! You pay for it first. Every TACO! place I have been to you order your food first. We got row of our orders wrong. The food was okay, small burritos. They never came back to fix one of the orders."}
{"text":"Correct Name: Tacos El Buen Pastor, NOT Taqueria El Buen Pastor or Tacos El Pastorcito  Correct Location: Corner  of Las Vegas Blvd. and Bonanza, NOT Eastern...  This is a duplicate listing....  Yelp HQ please handle this!!!"}
{"text":"YELP 365 CHALLENGE 2014-(315/365) \"Brick And Mortar\"  Open for just over two weeks now,  Tacos El Buen Pastor has finally opened their restaurant location right across Cardenas on Meadows and Decatur!   Not only can you feast on the best al pastor tacos in town IMO,  but they have expanded their menu to also include other specialties from Jalisco,  Mexico like Tortas Ahogadas and for those of you who remember Birrieria Jalisco back in the day (where Cornish Pasty now stands) Their Birria de Chivo ( Goat ) Estillo Jalisco is very hearty, delicious and generous in portion size (two sizes, $9 and $15) and comes with freshly made corn tortillas. Perfect for this cold weather!  I've never had a Torta Ahogada before ($6.50) so we got one done classically with Carnitas (However,  you may choose among their other meat selections, and the bread is said to also come from Mexico) this was also pretty huge, hearty, and good.  One of the great things about TEBP is their ordering system: you walk in and peruse the menu...When you know what you want, place your order with the person behind the counter,  pay,  and go find a seat. The cooks call your name when your order is up, and your food is nice and hot. No having to go to a certain line for a certain item, and when you're finally done paying,  your food is cold like those other places **cough El Gordo, Taco Y Taco cough**   Very comfy seating and spacious inside, with fresh agua frescas that change every so often (there was Horchata and Guayaba) and a full salsa bar to customize your order as you wish. Come check them out!  ALOHA!!!   Shaka Meter: \uuu/  \uuu/  \uuu/  \uuu/  \uuu/  5"}

I found that out by accident on a recent visit ordering three Al Pastor and some bomb horchata.  The lady handed me my plate loaded with 6 tacos then told me what the deal was. No complaints here! At $2 a taco, you can't go wrong here, especially if you are looking for a good taco, they are found on the streets....Las Vegas Blvd. and Bonanza  to be exact...and soon, their first brick and mortar location at Decatur and Meadows right across Cardenas!

{"text":"I will never go here again and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone either. I asked the lady who took our order for taqitos and pointed to the picture and my boyfriend ordered a carne asada burrito.  She repeated my the order back to me but somehow she got it wrong.  It came out as tacos. My boyfriend took it back and told her i didn't order tacos and she argued with him that I did. Instead of taking the tacos back and giving me my original order she made him pay for a new order of taqitos. I was pissed. Still being nice I ate the taqitos and the were dry as hell. I couldn't even swallow the meat without chocking. The taco and burrito meat was dry too. The worst service and experience ever!"}
{"text":"\"They are a little pricy but the meat and torillas they do it right\" says my man :) they're food is great! But on Fremont what do you expect when it comes to price? Things r doubled but at least the food is great  And so is their service."}
{"text":"Cheap, fast, fresh and efficient taco stand posted right by a tire shop, across from a community rec center. Folks the taste buds do not lie and I gotta thank the Goyamonstah once again for a recommendation. I recently brought a friend who enjoyed it the first time around so much that he was strongly considering going again dispite the possibility of missing his flight! Damn that's a mean taco! The pastor tacos are on point I think the only miss that I had was the mulita (sp) which was a little too plain for me. The gordita on the other hand, while somewhere around 5 bucks (?), is topped with so much and along with the various condiments they have to offer it can be a meal within itself. Don't know if it knocks Gordos outta the ballpark but its still damn good and got me wishin' we had something like this on my bougie azz side of town *cough*southeast*cough*. Mos definitely going back for more."}
{"text":"I'm so excited this place opened here. The food is amazing and there's service with a smile. Before I would drive 30 minutes to Vegas to get some of their Tacos El Pastor. They're the best I've ever had. It's a spacious place and the green sauce is to die for. The carne Asada fries my sister ordered were good, but the tacos were the highlight. Their horchata is delicious as well."}
{"text":"Don't do it! Not good and over priced. Came for lunch. Flautas and a quesadilla was $29! Food was blan! Hit Roberto's on Gibson instead.  Ok to skip."}
{"text":"We just moved into the neighborhood from L.A. and was looking to get something to eat for breakfast and we saw this restaurant The Best Taqueria that caught our attention and wanted to see if it was true. So we walked in and Irma who was working at the register greeted us when we walked in. She highly recommended the tacos de al pastor but ordered chilaquiles and huevos rancheros for my wife and I. We asked for coffee and Irma said they didn't sale any but she said that she had her own and offered it to us. Wow we thought! So far they have the best customer service. She could have left it at no coffee served but she went above and beyond That was awesome. As we finished Irma was gracious enough to give us a sample taco de al pastor to try and let me tell you that was the best taco de al pastor ive tried in along time. The food was delicious and we highly recommend this place. This will be our go to place for Mexican food. Not to mention Patty who was our server was really nice and made sure we were taken care of while dining inside. Great place a must try!"}
{"text":"Do you love authentic Mexican tacos?. This place is a taco stand on the corner of Las Vegas and bonanza Boulevard in the parking lot.   There are zero tables. In fact do not walk over here for Fremont Street it is a sketchy couple of blocks. Take a cab or Uber it is totally worth your trip! But the food is amazing it's fresh it's clean. The condiments are in a plugged in and chilled refrigerated area. It's wonderful.  Wednesday night is buy one get two free Al Pastor tacos. These could be a tie for the best Al Pastor taco I've ever had in Mexico a couple of months ago. The pineapple is great with the meat and spices. So the tacos are amazing the condiments are outstanding. All th meats we had were super juicy."}
{"text":"My hubby and I went in to have some dinner and well he ordered his usual 4 al pastor tacos with pineapple and they were mediocre at best well I decided to try the new steak nachos they added to their menu and well sense they're NACHOS I asked to get NACHO cheese on them and the cashier said it would be $2 extra for NACHO Cheese on my NACHOS I told her that I didn't want the shredded Mozzarella I only wanted the nacho cheese and she went and asked one of the cooks if it was extra for the nacho cheese and he said yes and I explained that it didn't make sense that the steak fries were $10.50 with nacho cheese and the steak nachos were $10.50 with the shredded mozzarella and all I wanted was for her to switch the cheeses she said that they couldn't do that and that it was $2 extra which equalled $12.50 for a medium portion of steak nachos never have I paid so much for nachos and they were not that great not only that but sense the cook got my order wrong and I returned them and asked to get my order exactly how I wanted them sense I did have to pay extra he got mad and gave me the most unappetizing nachos ever the first order look delicious and I was excited for them and then I noticed they got my order wrong so when I returned them I could hear him yelling in Spanish saying what the fuck it's just cheese and why are people so dam picky and come on if I pay for something and end up having to pay extra for It I want exactly how I ordered them! I honestly regret buying them and going there for dinner they have really bad customer service and the cooks are assholes the cashiers laugh at people that come in and they're all around mean they lack customer service I really hope they close this place down!"}
{"text":"Use to be a great food truck in Las Vegas Blvd and bonanza, the owner was always there taking care of the customers and the food now Hector is never there they hired a lots of people and grew  up so fast and open this location on Decatur, very very disappointed not the same food at all, the al pastor meat not even close when they had the food truck (still open) but quality quantity and customer service are gone.... I was one of the first customers and mentioned to him that he was going to be very successful but one important thing is not to lose the essence and nature of his business but for some reason lost all of that, food to grease, tacos with cold tortillas and almost no meat, Al pastor burned and old meat looks like the leftovers ..... I'm not going back."}
{"text":"The employees are really nice and the pastor and chicken tacos are really good. I prefer their pastor more than taco y taco. I look forward on trying the other menu items in future visits."}
{"text":"Just went today for the 2 for 1 al pastor deal! These tacos were bomb and for the price you can't go wrong. So glad they finally open up a taco place on this side of town. I'm about to go all the time now that it is so accessible for me."}
{"text":"Love this place!! The food tastes fresh every time and the prices are reasonable, especially when the portions are so large! Service is fast and all the employees are friendly and helpful. The pastor tacos are really amazing, you have to get one! I ordered a sope and it was more than enough for one meal. Definitely a great spot for lunch"}
{"text":"The costumer service is pretty poor, Everyone here is mad, I don't know if is for they lives or just for a bad day, but the service is pretty bad, the food is ok but I wouldn't go there again just to see angry faces"}
{"text":"So we were driving away from the Cashman Center and my father-in-law (who owns a few taquerias in California) goes, \"hey, pull over; those are going to be good tacos.\" We did and he was absolutely right. How he could tell that from 3 lanes away with the windows rolled up, I don't know - but I'm happy that he has psychic taco finding skills.  Hands down, Tacos El Pastorcito has the best al pastor in Vegas. I've been across the city from the chain stores to the street-corner taquerias whose menus aren't even in English. This place ranks at the very top. Yes, it's on a street corner in the parking lot of a tire shop -- BUT it has an \"A\" rating from the heath inspector (most mobile kitchens are \"B\"s at best). Yes, it's in a ghetto part of town, but it's 30 seconds off the freeway, so suck it up, jump off the 96 and risk your personal safety for 5 minutes while you pick up some of the best tacos in Vegas.   The carne asada is worth the risk and the al Pastor will make you completely forget that you are surrounded by drunken creepers staggering home from Fremont Street.  Delicious!"}
{"text":"I went there with my boyfriend to get some real authentic street tacos. We love our tacos and we were not impressed with this place. We both ordered carnitas and we got chunks of orange looking pork that were dry and not at all what we had expected. The pork tacos came with pineapple but I decided I just wanted authentic so we went without, and maybe with the pineapple, the tacos would've been alright. Overall, it was OK nothing great and I wouldn't be driving out of my way to come here again."}
{"text":"This is a must do when on Fremont.   The menu is extensive, which made me a bit weary, but the ingredients are simple and the dishes well put-together so it works.  Don't expect to get the cheapest food (it is Vegas and touristy) but it's a nice option for quick and decent tasting food.  The plus is that they have a salsa bar! Douse those tacos in red sauce. Wet that torta in green sauce."}
{"text":"Being from San Diego it is hard to find a good taco place that compares but this place has the Tj style taco down pack! The service is fast and the staff is super friendly, the owner is always there checking on the customers and is helpful, friendly, and a pleasure to talk to. We have been coming here for awhile and have yet to be disappointed. The Al Pastor is great and their fish tacos are even better. We always recommend this place when people are looking for good Mexican food in Vegas. We actually came across this place off the strip at the taco stand they had out there and have been hooked ever since five years later! Whenever we take a trip down to Vegas we have to stop in and grab a few tacos!"}
{"text":"One of the best tacos I've ever had- and I've had a lot. The pastor and chorizo are amazing I'm coming back to try the chicken and carne. They are simple and you get to top them yourself with fresh cut ingredients - pickled onions cilantro, radishes, 3 salsas, it's worth slumming it for these tacos"}
{"text":"By far the best street tacos in town.  I used to frequent the location on bonanza and Las Vegas Boulevard all the time. It was amazing there and it's amazing here. Consistency is great in a small chain and this place does it.  The bbq fajita burrito is amazing and the street tacos are phenomenal. The lengua is tender and moist. The carne asada is perfectly cooked.  The green salsa is flavorful and very spicy, just how I like it. Love this place. Check it out!"}
{"text":"These tacos are legitimate. Yummy habanero salsa. Lots of chopped cilantro and onions available.$2.50 ea isn't cheap, but so worth it downtown when you want it.   Seating is adequate but unimpressive.   Clientele can dictate your experience, probably. I.e. If it's late and they're drunk, you might not like it as much ;-)"}
{"text":"Best tacos I've tried so far! Really bad place, kinda scary. But the pastor tacos with piña were delicious!"}
{"text":"Went in for lunch with hubby today. I got pastor tacos, hubby got carne asada. Staff was friendly, place was clean... not sure why there were 50 flies inside that no one acknowledged.  Food was OK. A little fatty but flavor was OK. Would be a good place to come late nite after drinking.. maybe.... still nothing like tacos in cali"}
{"text":"this place has the best horchata I've ever had, they make it completely from scratch. The owners are the sweetest people and you can tell the workers like their job. It's a great atmosphere and the food is great. A little on the pricey side but that's about it. The carne asada tacos are amazing!"}
{"text":"If your idea of a good time is putting different kinds of spicy, savory, delicious Mexican delights in your mouth then this is the place for you. And I haven't even mention the chorizo yet. Tacos are awesome and you can't really go wrong with the selection unless you are ordering a hotdog or hamburgers which they don't do here. Sorry, tough break. Their Carne asada will tantalize your taste buds while the pastor will make you wish your mom was Mexican so you didn't have to miss years of amazing tacos. Thanks, mom.   Only downside, if you can call it a downside, is you have to package your own condiments like sauces and sides. Other places seem to just throw limes and sauce cups your way with each order. So, I guess if you're kind of lazy its a downfall? Anyway, give this place a try!!"}
{"text":"Just checked this place out today... It was not very busy.. The establishment was clean and the staff was very nice... I though the prices were a bit high.. My only  issue is that they only had one option for a combo plate... The food was good.... but not worth me coming back again... FYI... If your order is less than $10, make sure you have cash.. Only accept card for more than $10"}
{"text":"Always expect to be full when you leave. It's a \"quik fix'n\" that my wife and I never miss when we're in Las Vegas. The Torta is so big, we ALWAYS share it. GREAT PLACE"}
{"text":"So its 3 am and you need to sober up this is it. best part is that they have different locations. they have a little cart on the corner of eastern and Fremont as well as one on lv blvd and bonanza. so if youre downtown hanging out and want a quick, cheap and delicious bite to eat walk on over to Las Vegas Blvd and Bonanza where the tire shop is and you will find them  just look for the crowd as there are always people there."}
{"text":"Waooo this place is amazing , good food , excellent staff , look clean .. Los chilaquiles que sirven aqui estan riquisimos"}

Just alright.    ------------------------------------------  You've got your tacos, and then you have everything else. I come here for tacos, and although I appreciate that they have Jericalla (flancito) (unlike their original downtown truck), it is a tad steeply priced at 3.50$ a serving when Los Antojos [http://www.yelp.com/biz/los-antojos-las-vegas?hrid=TF0KCJK2ujGG_uZdF8tWQw&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)] gives you a plate the size of your goddamn head for that price (and their flan is actually good). Of course that is across town, so ... 'drive or quit complaining, Edwin P.!'    Although ... there is a cute employee here. I am honest enough to admit that this fact probably accounts for more than half of my patronage. (Check check-ins.) You see: I am an honest creep. The last honest creep.

Pro Tip: You have to pay with cash if it's less than 10$. Not unheard of when it comes to taco stands; however, this is restaurant with storefront. Bit weird.   Superfluous Note: Maximum room capacity 59.  Pro Tip: They make some good stuff, you know. Skip the flan.  The location is somewhat hard to miss because they don't have large (or any, really) signage besides one small vinyl that cannot be the largest size that the County Commission permitted. Don't know.

No desserts except very very very seldom they offer a flan that is not to my likening. Half or more of the time I have patronised, they also don't even have horchata. Of course this is not scientific at all. Maybe they have horchata during the daytime and run out every day at 2 P.M.; I don't know. Figure it out on your own, asshole!  There are also cans of soda-pop, if you do that.

The salsa verde with avocado on the asada tacos is amazing. I haven't tried anything else on the menu but I can't wait!!"}
{"text":"Looked on Google for a good taco truck .el buen Pastor was listed.after many hours of driving this place in Bakersfield was what we were looking for.The tacos de asada and the tacos al pastorand de  carnitas, were the bomb.the salsa was good and the service great.the tacos are small but delicious.i highly recommend this taco truck.there is plenty of seating and it's clean."}
{"text":"I can't speak highly enough about this place; best Mexican food truck in the city hands down.  I work down the street and this is the closest food place to get anything.   The steak tacos are AMAZING. Beautiful seasoning (then again I'm a wimp when it comes to seasoning so there's that) and are 2.50 a pop. A little pricey but honestly SO WORTH.   I also get a cheese quisladdas for 5 bucks give or take 50 cents and Damm if I've never had so much cheese in one of these before, it is God sent. One time they even accidently gave me a steak quisladdas and didn't charge me extra for it. I can vouch that it was amazing.  I also got a special burrito made (bean cheese rice with sour cream) today, they put lettuce in it for some reason but damn was it good (and I Hate lettuce in my food) and they brought the price down from 8 bucks to 5 bucks for my order.  There is also a little cart thingy full of sauces and sides and it does have a drop cover thing so it is very sanitary, also has the time written on each part so you know how fresh it is.   Customer service here is fantastic always smiling and happy to make you special orders I usually have this nice gentleman that's really nice to me in the early afternoons. They make your food to order so expect to wait between 5 to 10 min for your order depending on how busy it is but man is it worth the wait.   Now please note before you rage about the 2.50 street tacoz and 8 buck burritos, how close this truck is to the strip and the fact that it is permenetly parked in a parking lot of a business meaning : they are expecting a lot of tourists so of course that's gonna bring the price up a little, and they are more likely than not paying rent to have their truck parked so might also be effecting the prices.  I can't recommend this place enough, I always point it out to tourists at my job, and it's a short walk from Freemont so please check this place out!"}
{"text":"Eh.....this new place that took over what used to be a Wendy's is average.  Just average.  Wifey took us here after her co-workers raved how good their food was.  We decided to stop by one Friday night for a quick dinner.  It was less than what I expected.  Most of her co-workers are Mexican!  No joke.  You enter Taqueria El Buen Pastor and it's just confusing where to go.  You look straight back and there you see the counter where your order is cooked.  But the cashier station is all the way on the left side?  Weird.  Second thing that really bothered me?  The damn pricing!  Is this upscale Mexican food?  I was hoping for more rustic like a good tiny taco shop or even a Roberto's.  But this place charges you an arm & a leg for an entrée.  It's cheaper (and probably just as good) as the eatery in Cardenas Market right across the street!  But I digress.  After looking at the menu, which is basically plastered all over their walls in no good arrangement, we placed our order.  We had:  *Burrito Al Pastor ($8!) *Carne Asada Nachos ($10.50!) *Cheese Quesadilla ($5.50!)  I place the '!' as definitely an exclamation.  Prices be rising!  Unfortunately I cannot condone the quality for the prices.  The salsa bar on the opposite side of the cashier was OK, stocked with the usual pickled carrots, cucumbers, radishes, and salsas.  Veggies were a bit limp, the carrots didn't have enough time to pickle properly so they were weak.  And their salsas?  Ugh, they weren't so tasty.  Salt, guys?  Burrito Al Pastor was really lackluster.  It was small first of all, and when I cut it open there was nothing to be excited about.  This burrito was gloomy!  Al pastor, rice, beans, some cheese.  So plain.  No even a little color with some fresh salsa inside.  It tasted kinda plain too.  The al pastor was light on flavor - not much spice on my tongue, or much sweet from pineapple that should be in there.  Pretty disappointing.  Cheese Quesadilla?  For over $5?  Better be damn good!  And it really wasn't.  It was a tortilla.  Filled with bland cheese.  Then put on the grill to brown.  How hard can it be to make this?  And why does this particular one cost so much?  Nothing special.  I could have easily made a quesadilla better than this one for much less.  Hell, Del Taco makes a better cheese quesadilla.  Maybe even Napoleon Dynamite too.  The somewhat saving grace of this place was the Carne Asada Nachos.  Chips were hot & crispy, carne asada was crisp.  There was even color in the form of fresh salsa (with a TON of red onions) & guacamole.  But even this dish wasn't perfect.  Nachos should have cheese!  Lots of cheese!  This one was skimpy on the cheese.  And for damn near $11?  The platter should have been BIGGER!  Could barely feed the 3 of us.  With more cheese and more chips this would have been a winner.  Taqueria El Buen Pastor is not a winner overall in my book.  It was just so underwhelming.  And I was a bit excited too because I saw Tacos de Cabeza (brain) and Tacos de Lengua (tongue) on the menu.  But at like $2 each ($2.50 for lengua) I'm not so sure.    Mira, mira...update your prices amigos!"}
{"text":"Street vendor you say?  Not even close!  More like a pop up outdoor dining Mexican goodness that will have you shouting hallelujah!

From their Asada Tacos, Pastor tacos, pollo tacos, and delicious tortas that all combine for a real authentic Mexican meal! Do yourself some good and stop in, just be aware of your surroundings as the area is a bit sketchy!"}

{"text":"Amazing!!  Shout out to Nelson Q for this introduction.  If you're a big fan of street tacos then you have to check out this place.  The Al Pastor w/ pineapple remind much like El Gordos's Adobada Tacos, but instead they have slightly larger tortilla, more meat, better hot sauce, and cheaper at $1.50 pop.   I also like how  their pineapple chunks are a lot smaller because each bite is more balance.    Things they need to improve: -The quesadilla cheese need to be melted.  My first bite and I could still see the shredded mozzarella inside.  Would be better if they use Oaxaca cheese or something. -The tortilla for the tacos need some work.  Put some oil on those babies or something. -They have a condiment bar on the side which could be a good thing or a bad thing.  I think it would have been nice if the cooks handled the onions and cilantro part, but that's just me nitpicking.  The lot was crowded when i got there, so i had to park across the street.  I think the location of this stand is great because of all the foot traffic it receive, but it doesn't feel all that sunny if you know what i mean.    So ever since this encounter, i've been having mixed cravings between this stand and Taco El Gordos.  And that's saying a lot mi amigo."}
{"text":"If there's any al pastor in Vegas that's better, please tell me right away. I need to know.  I've avoided coming back to this taco stand since last year for one reason or another, but since I'm working nearby for a little while, it was so easy to stop by Taqueria El Buen Pastor. Having learned about the standing buy one get one free offer for tacos al pastor on Wednesdays, I've been back on that specific day of the week twice now. At $1 a pop when discounted, those babies were all that I ordered, and they were all that I needed.  I'm not sure how they encase their other tacos, but the tortillas on these get crisped slightly but with minimal use of oil, if any. They're a great base for the excellent fillings. Speaking of which, you have to get the pineapples with the tacos al pastor. Luckily, the cashier has asked me both times whether I wanted it served with pineapple. I'm pretty sure they grill the pineapple up to add that extra flavor to what's already a great sweet and crunchy element.   The meat itself is a fantastic savory, sweet, and somewhat smoky experience that works even without additional salsa. If and when you do go for salsa, skip the tomatillo salsa because it just doesn't complement the al pastor meat. Get either the spicy avocado salsa, the orange colored salsa, or perhaps both (note to self: try that next time). Just don't forget to add the onions, cilantro, and even lime to your liking. Those are essential for adding even more flavor and texture, so don't forget to stop at that metal-covered condiment station.  I told myself before that I would try their other tacos, but the al pastor tacos alone are enough to make Taqueria El Buen Pastor a must-visit. That's even before considering the BOGO offer on Wednesdays, which makes it all the better. Maybe I'll be able to justify trying the other meats if I have an interesting night in Downtown Las Vegas, but I'd be perfectly content without them."}
{"text":"Just another taqueria? Nah, more like the perfect spot for my milestone review #900.  Taqueria El Buen Pastor is a local chain which I've enjoyed for years their street corner truck on Las Vegas and Bonanza. When I heard that they'd be opening a new brick and mortar near me, I was excited. When I drove by and saw the \"new open\" banner, I got even more excited. They're the kind of delicious, cheap, and local place which I tend to favor over chains and fancy restaurants. Regarding \"cheap\" though, be forewarned that the to-go menus are not updated with the accurate, higher prices...  I found time to stop by shortly after lunch rush on a Wednesday. I found it as anticipated in the old Baja Fresh location in the southwest corner of the Galleria Mall Ring Circle (the road around the mall, not the mall itself) right by Blaze Pizza, and I was happy that it wasn't crowded as I'm sure it will be soon. When I asked the cashier, she replied that they're indeed offering the 2-for-1 tacos al pastor for Wednesday, which has sadly been discontinued at the truck. (Also available on Wednesday: BOGO tortas ahogadas, which would be suitable if you're able to find a friend or want some leftovers. I'll probably fall in the latter camp for my next visit.)  The tacos al pastor ($2.50) are almost as good as what I've had so many times at the truck,  meaning that I'd still favor this over other taquerias. The marinade is flavorful and the final product even with diced pineapple isn't too sweet. Add on cilantro, onions, and orange and spicy salsas from the condiment station on the side, and it's just what I need on a Wednesday.  Thankfully, I also decided that it was finally time to try some other meats ($3 tacos, for the ones I ordered). They're no slouch. The lengua may be my new favorites in town because they're delicious and surprisingly tender. The buche is at least close if not equal to my favorite. The tripas - when asked, I ordered them crunchy - are \"cleaner\" than other  offerings, which may be a plus depending on your feelings on that aspect of tripas. I'd say that these are different but equal. Also, my plate came with a very small side of chips and refried beans, which were both very good.  This is an order-then-sit-down place, and there are plenty of seats, whether you'd like tall counters at the windows or more typical tables. It's unusually spacious around the entrance, but the interior is certainly large if not cavernous. Prices are higher than at the truck, but I'm more than glad to live with that because of the convenience of not having to go far and also being able to find parking and seating.  Taqueria El Buen Pastor is one of the best taquerias in town, and they're now in Henderson. Check them out if you're a local or just passing by, especially if it's Wednesday!  (UPDATE 3/14: The $3 taco de asada is nothing to write home about, but the $2.50 taco de cabeza is pretty solid.)"}
{"text":"Great tacos, I had two asada steak, the other chorizo.  They were delicious and next Day I came back and I doubled my order!"}
{"text":"I came here a couple of hours after the big quake of '15.  I needed to take my mind off of how frightening it was to feel such tremendous geologic power.  OK, so that is a bit of an exageration.  I grew up in SoCal, earthquake country USA.  Feeling that little temblor we had made me home sick and I needed a couple of good tacos as a remedy.    I had to try Taqueria El Buen Pastor.  I think I tried it once as a food truck and wanted to give it another go.  I ordered one asada taco and two el pastor tacos complete with pineapple.  I went to the salsa/topping bar for some cilantro, onions and green salsa.  This trifecta is what makes it for me.  I topped each of my tacos with the three and chowed down.    I went with the asada first.  It was fine.  The meat was tender but not overly flavorful.  The el pastor tacos were better.  The pineapple gives such a punch in the arm to that pig.  There was a bit of gristle in the pork but nothing severe.  I just picked it out and kept going.  As good as the el pastor was and the asada wanted to be, the real standout here was the tortillas.  They were warm and fresh.  They only time I have had corn tortillas so good they were homemade.  I would come here for just the tortillas and have a side of meat to put inside."}
{"text":"Oh, I am in trouble. A Taqueria el Buen Pastor so close to home can be dangerous to my health and wallet. Regardless, I stopped in last night to get a few tacos. OK, five tacos if you want to know the truth. In my defense I only wanted four. But the al pastor tacos were 2 for 1. Thats 2. Then I wanted one each asada and pollo. Thats 4. But thats not the end of the story. My bill with 4 tacos came to $8 and change. Unfortunately the minimum order to use a card is $10 (which honestly irritates me). Rather than getting a drink I didn't need to bring my bill to the $10 minimum I got another asada taco that I didn't need. I was also offered a little zip lock baggie with two little cups and lids for salsa. I filled one with onion and cilantro because I'm pretty sure its a law that street tacos be topped with such things. The other cup I filled with green salsa that seemed to have chunks of avacado in it. Delicious. All of it. Delicious.  Good food. Good service. Good greif. I repeat, I am in trouble."}
{"text":"I being Mexican am very picky about my tacos. These by far are the best tacos that I have tasted in Vegas. I tend to compare food to how my mom makes it, and to be honest these tacos are better than the ones my mom makes. You pay for what you get here. Tacos are anywhere from $2-$3 and burritos $8 but they are worth every mouth watering penny. PARKING IS THE ONLY BAD PART, but it is totally worth it. The owner is also very nice and takes care of his patrons."}
{"text":"I've only been once, but I will definitely come back! I had the Carne Asada Fries, and they were bomb! I was a little hesitant about the nacho cheese instead of shredded, but it works. The meat is flavorful. Even got it to go and it was literally still steaming hot when I sat down to eat. Can't wait to try more!"}

{"text":"Okay so I think it's time to officially admit that I have a taco addiction and honestly, I have Yelp to thank for that. This taco spot came up on my feed as a \"Hot New Business\" so I decided to check it out. I seriously can't stop dreaming about the food at this place! I've tried the al pastor fries, carne asada plate, fish tacos, chicken tacos, al pastor tacos, and their chorizo plate. Every item was expertly cooked to perfection. Plus they have an amazing salsa bar with the best mild, medium, and hot salsas to add to any dish. Prices are reasonable too and every day of the week they have a different special, so be sure to ask the cashier what the special of the day is."}
{"text":"The night was young. After drunkenly exploring Fremont Street, I was met with a dilemma. My body needed nourishment. I was happily met with this Mexican Street food. Foolishly I decided to gamble on my health in the spirit of Las Vegas. Little did I know I was about to wage an impossible war with a wet burrito. As the sweet chicken and salsa Verde met my lips my mind was at peace. Alas, like the calm before the storm, all hell was about to break loose. They say \"Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned\", but these people have never had a wet burrito from El Buen Pastor decimate your bowels. I projectile vomited furiously in an attempt to fight back against the parasitic burrito, but all was for naught. It has now been 20 hours since I got food poisoning from this place. Save yourself, don't make the same mistake I did. I had spread my dreams into that wet burrito. Tread softly because it will vomit on your dreams."}
{"text":"Let me tell you just standing out here screams delicious to me it's on the corner of Las Vegas Boulevard and Bonanza Road it is the best taco place I've ever been to I will never go to Pepe's again I will never go to Roberto's again this Taco Stop is amazing!! It is life you have not lived until you've been here the next freaking Yelp event needs to be at this Taco Shop please I will pay myself to get in and pay for everybody's food nothing else you must get the pork pork pork pork pork pork nothing but the pork it is freaking delicious! HONESTLY... Between me n you(its my 2nd time here today!!)"}
{"text":"Trust me, I'm Mexican.   This place has THE best carne asada I've had, besides my own ;) After shopping at Cardenas my son and I came here. This used to be an old Wendy's,  but they changed the inside drastically!  Nice! It was super later, almost 9 so I figured we'd get the janky meat. NOPE!  We ordered 4 tacos (2$ taco) de asada, paid, and went straight to the salsa bar. I noticed they had cilantro, onions, and various sauces so I figured to get a little of everything. The cashier brought out our food, which was really nice, and I noticed they were just plain tacos, just the meat and tortillas. I would definitely prefer more taco places to do this, because some people like my son, do not like onions and its a pain if you forget to tell them no onions. Also allows you to put as much cilantro or onions as you'd like. While examining the tacos, I noticed that the pieces of asada were huge! The tacos were definitely loaded! They come on a hot corn tortilla,  because seriously,  a taco on flour is a BURRITO. Pinches gavachos! And when I say the taco is packed, I mean it! I added my fixings and took a bite, my son had already finished one taco and was already getting his second one ready!  The asada here is cooked perfect, it is moist and tender, seasoning was on point as well, and did not taste like it had been sitting there for hours (Frijoles!) I had no gristle,  nor was it burned or charred. Coming as late as I did I expected that, but it was the opposite.  Mexicans always do it better! Lol.   My son is absolutely in love, so we will continue to frequent this spot after our trips to our motherland (Cardenas) haha.   AJUAAA!"}
{"text":"Before I go to every taco truck, I taste the meat before anything and it had flavor! All the sauce was really good with flavor with the spicy sauce had a little more spice. Saw this taco truck on tv and wanted to give it a try and it was worth it! Recommend!"}
{"text":"2$ a taco & you have to build it yourself,all they do is hand you plain tacos & you have to add your own toppings.I also ordered the loaded hotdog & the mushrooms were canned & close to frozen.Sorry but won't be coming back.Tacos El Gordo is way better"}
{"text":"El Gordo might be more popular but this place has better tacos plus offers chicken for people who don't eat beef or pork. Prices are super reasonable and salsa bar is amazing"}
{"text":"3 1/2, really.  Almost passed on this one once we found it in a sketchy neighborhood. Almost under the freeway, I first noticed the rainbow, marquee for Taqueria El Buen Pastor scrolling on a tire and lube business. Confused for a moment, we then noticed the busy taco truck parked on the corner. I echo others' observation about being on your gaurd around this area; I was reminded here that NV is an open carry state.  Warning: Very limited parking! We came around 10pm and had to park in the \"gated\" motel lot next door.   Couldn't tell if the lady was being condescending or not as she lengthily greeted my white-face-and-red-hair in Spanish. My Filipino companion greeted her in English to which she answered in perfect English the remainder of our encounter...  Prices are higher than what I'm used to pretty much everywhere in CA. I'm not sure if it's just this place or LV in general but I was surprised. $2 for tacos, $3.50 for ranchero (super) which comes with cheese, rice, beans, guac, and crema. Of course, Ranchero comes with less meat in order to make room for all those extra goodies. Standard burritos $8. Ordered the pastor (of course). Best part of these tacos is the inclusion of pineapple in the pastor; The sweet-salty spice combination is tasty. The actual spice flavor of the pastor was okay, could have been marinated longer or been more generous with the spice. Portions are pretty good- this is a meaty taco. The tortilla is on the smaller side but pretty full with meat. They have a mexican fixins' bar with cilantro/onion, salsas, limes, etc. I'd say the ranchero isn't worth it but get the regular taco. $2 extra for \"guacamole avocado\"...(!)   Good, cheap eats *for Vegas* and copacetic in the realm of tacos, although, not the best I've had. I think alot of these are drunk reviews."}
{"text":"Very expensive. Poor service. If you have the time to wait it may work out for you. I waited 30 minutes in an empty place for my food. So disappointing. I won't be back."}
{"text":"For a little hole in the wall this place was absolutely delicious. This is as authentic Mexican food as you're going to get right on Fremont St. I was a little cautious at first but as I looked at what other people were eating I knew it was going to be good. If you like Mexican food I promise you won't be disappointed. Their Torta Cubana is one of the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"It was my first time there, I wanted some menudo, so I stop in, they were out of menudo, so I got asada nacho and some asada tacos. Waited for 30 minutes for my food! And I thought it was kinda pricey. Won't be going back there again."}
{"text":"If I could give this place a 0 I would. Went in from out of town and found a WORM in our food. It was probably from the cilantro that is sitting out in the air. Took it to the person in charge and she did not care. Gross."}
{"text":"Great food. The space is not very well organized but when you have good food who cares. I have been there a few times and every item I have had from the menu has been awesome. If you are looking for authentic Mexican taqueria, this is the place to go to."}
{"text":"I'm no rookie when it comes to street tacos...and thank sweet baby Hayzoos there are options here in LV, otherwise known as East East LA.  These people just do it right.  Their commitment to fast, fresh and fabuloso is spot on. You won't be disappointed.  Oralè."}
{"text":"Finally ! A place to go to in Henderson that reminds me of taco shops in South Texas. They offer a wide selection of tacos, tortas, and more. PRICES ARE reasonable.  Although I went in on a Wed( taco specials ) I decided on a torta with carne asada and a agua fresca ! They have what is almost like an open kitchen which shows me that the food is made to order. As I patiently waited I drank the agua fresca which was sweet but not overly sugary. Then someone brought me the biggest torta ever ! Filled with beans,asada, mayo, cheese, lettuce, tomato and jalapenos! For $9 that's a bargain and you can easily share one ! Everyone was super friendly ! I'll be back but with a sidekick to share next time !"}
{"text":"My husband and I came to have some \"us\" time. We were roaming around Fremont street. We were not too hungry but wanted something to snack on. Well that was a mistake, we came in here they have excellent, friendly service and the food is GOOD. We wanted more than a snack! We are coming back tomorrow and the next if possible. We ordered tacos and they have a small salsa bar with condiments which allows you to fix up your Taco to your liking! If you don't like onions no problem, if you want a lot of onions no problem. Love it!"}
{"text":"Excellent! Excellent! Great tasting, kind service, clean establishment, timely delivery of food. Portion could be bigger for price but absolutely delicious! My husband, son and myself were pleasantly surprised (and that's an accomplishment bc we are all picky with different palates) THANK YOU.. We will def be back  We ordered Tortas and Tacos"}
{"text":"Is ok. I liked their tacos al pastor very much but not the carne asada ones. the meat was kind of dry....overall, a good spot to stop after a game at the Cashman Center or a late snack."}
{"text":"Best tacos in Vegas hand down!  This has been my main taco joint for years. Menu selection is great, prices are reasonable, and the staff is friendly. They handle orders amazingly fast, and I love the salsa bar. Parking is a bit rough, so don't roll with a whole squad. Carpool and save the headache. Easy walking distance within the Downtown area, and they are open 24/7. Order anything with Asada and leave happy."}
{"text":"Best al pastor taco I have ever tasted! I tried one chicken taco, one al pastor and one carne asada. All were delicious but I should have just ordered 3 al pastor with pineapple and the medium (orange) salsa because it did not get better than that! Also, great horchata and super friendly staff."}
{"text":"Very bad service didnt like this place at all..first there is no fountain drinks u have to buy a soda can  each for 1.25 or horchata ONLY have small for 2.50 each cup TERIBLE SERVICE by the way witch makes it a bad first  expierance ...i also wanted to take salsa guys what NO LIDS for the little cups of salsa i asked and never got any didnt even say SORRY WE ARE OUT ..and last of all we ate there and it seened as they had NO AIR. This was my first and last time there SOOOOO DISAPOINTED I GIVE THIS PLACE ZERO STARS IF I COULD"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place!! A+ customer service and the best Mexican fast food in Henderson!! I swear I eat here at least twice a week!! Really good prices and quality of food is top notch!"}
{"text":"Since Taqueria El Buen Pastor popped up on the Hot New Places list I've been here 3 times. And I will be back. That being said let's do a proper review.   Location: Easy to get to as it's located off the West side of the Galleria mall ring road. Parking: It's right next to Blaze Pizza which can get a lot of traffic. Sometimes parking can be tight.  Pricing: While this Taqueria might have started from a taco truck, the prices have been adjusted a little to cover for the increased overhead of a fixed location. I still consider it reasonable for the quantity and quality of the food, but 3 of us went and spent $40 easily.  Food: Tacos Al Pastor. I'm not as experienced in Mexican food as some of the elites are on here, but after falling in love with Taco Y Taco's Al Pastor, what I found here blew me away. I'm also a fan of their carne asada tacos. I usually end up ordering 2 Al Pastor and 1 Carne Asada or switching it around. It's hard to choose.   I've taken my 8 year old here and he's a fan of their enchiladas. But like many 8 year olds sometimes he wants chicken fingers or something similar, and he's a fan of their chicken fingers as well.   I also have to mention their Horchata which is made fresh every day. It's not from concentrate or powder, it's made the right way. I noticed the difference right away.   Negatives: While the regular staff is friendly there is one manager that works there who needs to be pulled aside by upper management and reminded of customer service basics. She comes across as rude, so much so that my son even noticed and asked me what is her problem? When he notices, it's pretty significant.   Also the Coke machine has been down for 2 weeks. Granted they have bottled Coke in the cooler but come on, surely this machine can be fixed in 2 weeks as this is a new restaurant. And they don't take tips if you pay with a card...which IMHO is wrong. If the surly manager I previously mentioned is not working, good service deserves to be acknowledged.   Also on one visit there were no cups at the salsa bar. Seriously? And charging $1.50 for Kirkland (Costco) bottled water? I know they have to pay the staff and keep the lights on but I found this to be ridiculous. (I know some will say that's reasonable but if I'm going to pay that I'd prefer to buy something else, but oh snap, the Coke machine still doesn't work!)  Sometimes when we get really hungry and we rattle off the list of places we can go to, tacos are one of our failsafe food choices. You can't go wrong with a good taco, and you'll find some great tacos here. Just be aware of the one manager who seem to have forgotten how to smile."}
{"text":"I'm traveling through, but I'm from Los Angeles. I've eaten thousands of amazing burritos and this is the best one I've tried in Las Vegas. Good tortilla, good salsa, good portion. $8 is a little more expensive than I'm used to paying, but pretty reasonable considering it's 24/7 and near the strip. The lady that took my order was also very friendly. I will probably be back before I leave town."}
{"text":"I'm disappointed. It's been a while since my last visit, but with its continued popularity, I expected the same experience. We arrived around 9:30PM on a Friday night and it wasn't too busy. We ordered four Pastor (with pineapple), two Cabeza, and two Lengua tacos. Prices are still the same at $2/each (Lengua is $2.25), however, meat portions are noticeably smaller. That was my first disappointment. Pastor is my favorite meat and I was looking forward to these tacos, but the meat was so dry and lacking a lot of flavor. Completely the opposite from what I had here before. Plus, the pineapple was practically non-existent. I thought they had forgotten to put pineapple on my order at first glance! The Cabeza and Lengua were fine. I'm not sure if it was an \"off\" night, but I was not happy with my tacos and Ruben was not impressed (it being his first time). We won't be returning."}
{"text":"Won't be back! I ordered 4- 2x1 (thinking 8 tacos for $4) and it was almost $6 for four tacos?! The deal is VERY misleading... I was told the tacos are $2 each which also isn't true. I'll stick with $1 chicken tacos on Tuesday/Weds at the other mexican spots."}
{"text":"Great tacos. From now on when I  am in Las Vegas on a food bender, this is the first stop.   The El pastor was amazing, juicy and plentiful. But it was all good. Full accompaniments of salsa and what not.  These guys work hard. Constant line of customers. So you know the food is fresh.   Some of the best street tacos ever!"}
{"text":"Delicious tacos. Had the pastor, pollo, and asada. PERFECT. Fast and friendly service plus great salsa bar. Just wish they had a few tables even stand up but hey it is a tire store parking lot. We are going to try one of their other more traditional locations but we will be back. YUMM"}
{"text":"Probably the best shrimp and al pastor tacos I've ever eaten. Incredible! Great staff. Clean. Friendly. A+!"}
{"text":"Ehh... to me it was just okay, i had their special the Al Pastor which was just okay. it did taste better in the gringa they offer. but it all seemed over priced for me. in total we got about 6 tacos and the gringa and spent around $30 if not more.  the green salsa though was so good i would only go back for that."}
{"text":"I've always wanted to go ever since it opened about a month ago but never really had the time to drop by.  Sad to say it was just ok. Nothing special.  Food: 7/10 I got some carne asada taco for 3$ and chicken taco for $2.50. A bit steep for the price in my opinion. The tacos both came with on a Styrofoam plate with 2 small tortillas underneath the meat and you get to pick whatever topping you want  I also got the asada fries, which were ok. The serving size was decent thought for the fries.  Location & Service: 9/10 The place is located conveniently near the mall and the place itself is clean and well kept.   The service was excellent. The girl explained each question about the menu which helped out on choosing what to get.   Overall, an ok experience. I would go back if I'm feeling ok tacos ."}
{"text":"Pretty yummy carne asada street tacos! Food truck just off fremont street it was  Cheap and delicious."}
{"text":"There was much debate on weither or not we wanted to go here. Honestly we were debating on going to Los Huicholes and spending $9 on the 2.5lb burrito, but we picked this for the fact that it was closer and we wanted to try something new. And let me tell you it exceeded our expectations. Presentation not so much but hey it's a food truck, quality and quantity is where this places excels, not to mention the taste. Everything was cooked perfectly and had great flavor but the unfortunate downsides, 1: location is terrible. It's located in the parking lot of the Payless tire shop on the corner of Bonanza and Las Vegas Blvd, its very crowed, cars parked all around and most are not for the food truck. You almost get hit by cars trying to pull in and out, you have to pay real attention. 2: it's very unorganized there is three different lines for the food truck, order, pick up and getting your own toppings and salsas. It's very confusing to which line is which, you stand there for thirty minutes trying to figure out where to stand. People are just standing around everywhere. 3: Everything is pretty much in Spanish. We had a very hard time ordering because the menu is in Spanish and the cashier only speaks Spanish so in line you have to take a five minute crash course on how to pronounce what you want to order. Aside from the bad there's a lot of good about this place. You get what you pay from and then some, I recommend the BBQ steak fajita burrito, simply amazing in my opinion. To sum up the good: quality, quantity, price and taste. The bad: location, unorganized and everything is in Spanish. I rate it 4/5 and if you can look pass the flaws I recommend you make Taqueria El Buen Pastor a must when traveling to Vegas."}
{"text":"Omg went here last night and the carne asada fries were DELICIOUS! Going back tonight."}
{"text":"Love this place. It's a food truck, which we did not realize for our first visit. We were looking for good authentic Mexican close by to downtown. It fit all of the criteria. The food is delicious and inexpensive. We've been back three more times and loved it each time.  Parking is limited though and you have to eat standing up or in your car.  We highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Extremely reasonable prices with some of the best tacos I've ever ate!!! I will be returning here numerous times"}
{"text":"What a nice little gem hidden on the old Las Vegas strip. I passed by this place twice and missed it both times, but finally saw it when I stood across the way to take a picture. This place is a small little hole in the wall, but it offers a big menu. They have everything from tacos, to tortas, to burritos and quesadillas. This is as authentic as it gets in Vegas. I could definitely compare to the delicious Mexican food we have back home in California. I ordered the tacos and they were so delicious I over ate. The staff is also very friendly and quick to wipe down their bar counter where people eat, to ensure its always clean for the next person. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"So I'll keep completely honest food is meh ...but the prices are ridiculously expensive. It's one of those locations you try once and never eat there again. I have yet to find a real authentic and good Mexican food restaurant out here and let me tell you sister.... this is not it."}
{"text":"Ummm yes!!!!! We've been here a few times during our trips to Fremont Street in Vegas because they have the absolute best tacos & carne asada burritos! Never disappointed! This small hole in the wall taco shop is located on Fremont street next to White Castles. It is a must try! Don't get intimidated by the hole in the wall atmosphere as the food here is great and affordable! I recommend the carne asada burrito!"}
{"text":"I tried a variety of different tacos here. Usually Carne Asada is my least favorite. Here, the Asada ended up being my favorite. The others were ok. The Asada fries were very good."}
{"text":"I really wanted to try this Mexican restaurant last Sunday, (Super Bowl Sunday). I went through the drive thru and ordered. When I got up to the window, I put the car in park. Through the window behind the guy taking the money was a girl. She picked her nose, blew her nose on a  used tissue, stuffed it back in her pocket and then sneezed into her hand. No way was I eating there after seeing that. I politely told the man I wanted to cancel my order. He was very polite to me and said, ok no problem. Yuck!!!!"}
{"text":"I had heard about this place from a family member, and they had praised it highly. It's open pretty late, and a friend and I decided to check it out one night while looking for a place to eat.  It's a taco truck, so I was initially averse to the idea of eating outside at 3 AM in the cold. However, after finding out that the California's Market Street Cafe was closed for its monthly (what are the chances?) cleaning, we were left with few other choices.  It's on the street corner, but it's brightly lit so you can't miss it. The neighborhood isn't the greatest, and a couple of loud, drunk people walked by, but they kept their distance. I'll admit I was a little anxious; it was cold, late, and I just wanted to eat my food and go home. Thankfully, there was a patio heater right next to the older Mexican woman who took our orders (she was quite nice).  I ordered one carne asada taco and a pastor huarache. Once I got my food though, I didn't regret standing out in the cold. The carne asada was delicious, and the pastor was super crispy, just the way I like it. The quality of the ingredients is excellent, and the taste is way better than anything you could get at most local chains.  Overall, I'd definitely recommend people to check out this taco truck. Maybe moreso when it gets a little warmer, though."}
{"text":"The cashier was super nice to us!! She recommended a few things to us and we just went with basic and she didn't seem annoyed or anything.   Good for families and good priced!   We ordered the Asada Nachos, carnitas tacos, and pastor tacos all which were good"}
{"text":"What a disappointment!  Salsa Bar is dirty, flies are flying all over the place. Found a small worm on my tacos today. When I told the cashier she completely ignored me. This place is disgusting."}
{"text":"This is an awesome taco stand and in a low key place. It has great ingredients and I'm super happy I was brought here. Vegetarian burrito was the best."}
{"text":"Long overdue review!! I love this taco shop :) The tacos are super yummy..lots of flavor and made fresh when you order. Salsa bar is awesome as well.. they keep it fresh and clean all the time. They have specials as well on Wednesdays you can get 2 for 1 tacos.  I think living around Henderson this is the most authentic place you can get some Al pastor meat."}
{"text":"Terrible,terrible,terrible. This place has horrible service we ordered something and the lady just left we hooked over and over and no one cared . She comes back with an attitude and has to double check that we payed for what we ordered she leaves again and takes forever just to get a drink ."}
{"text":"HOT DOG - I know, I know. You should order tacos or something Mexicany. I did. But I started with the hot dog. Ridiculously good.  Hard to go wrong with anything on the menu. I've tried several. All good.  The drink award however, must go, hands down, to the almighty ORCHATA! Trust me on this. If you haven't drank this Mexican goodness you haven't truly lived. Order one next time and watch your life change before your very eyes."}
{"text":"Order the TACOS RANCHEROS! My favorite is of course their specialty; Al Pastor and with Pineapple bits. They  consist of a pretty big corn tortilla, beans, melted cheese, guacamole meat, sour cream and more cheese on top.You'll be full with one or 2 depending on how much you can grub. This is my one of my top 3 spots to hit after bar hopping Down Town. Definitely my favorite \"drunk at 3 am\" spot."}
{"text":"Awesome street tacos here! We came in and had the chorizo tacos and quesadillas both plain and with carne asada. For four people out total was less than $50. The food is excellent quality and ingredients are top notch. The service is good and employees are very nice. This is THE best taco place on Fremont Street, possibly the best street taco place in Vegas."}
{"text":"Taqueria El Buen Pastor is one, if not, THE BEST place in the Vegas valley for GOOD Mexican food. I'm a regular at the food truck location on the corner of Las Vegas Blvd and Bonanza, especially when I used to live nearby. I never took the time to review that location because, well, they don't need it! But since this is the grand opening of the Henderson location, I thought I'd let people in the Henderson area know what's up since all they have to compare to is Chipotle, Cafe Rio, Roberto's and Faustos (although Faustos is pretty good too and WAY better than Robertos).  Anyways, Taqueria has the BEST tacos, no fake sh*t!!! The tortas and quesadillas are pretty bomb too. The tacos and horchata is what I mainly go for though! First of all, the horchata is FRESH and made there EVERY DAY!!! Nothing like good fresh horchata. Most places get that bs fountain drink kind horchata and it tastes so watered down and not really good. This horchata could keep me coming back even if the food wasn't good (I'm kidding, just trying to explain how good the horchata is lol)  I am so excited with this location too because not only is it closer, but there are so much more options and we can sit here! I'm used to the truck so you have to stand there or take it to-go. BUT, with that, I was able to try the shrimp burrito today and it was very yummy and filling! I was full halfway but made myself finish it. It was so worth it though.  To end this review, 10/10 would recommend. Try the tacos and horchata man."}
{"text":"Their food is by far the best Mexican food in Vegas ... The pastor, lengua and asada are amazing!"}
{"text":"Best burrito and tacos in Vegas. It's not even close! Carne Asada burrito is seasoned to perfection and  so very fresh. My mind is blown every time I come here. If you're from out of town or a local looking for a new favorite truck, this is the place."}
{"text":"After passing by so many times reading the great Yelp reviews, finally stopped by to try.  The street tacos were good (carnitas) and awesome (pastor with pineapple).  The cubana sandwich (sans jalapenos since I'm such a chicken) was HUGE, messy, and really good.  Wasn't too hungry but stuffed myself anyway."}
{"text":"Come here at least once a week and every time their food is amazing!! The tortas de asada are my favorite and everyone here is super sweet."}
{"text":"Food is good but the wait....grrrrrr damn!!! Very dumb system they have to get your food New items on the menu...if only the three cooks in the back get their act together and work better."}
{"text":"Had the worst and most ironic experience tonight. I went over to this place, looking for something good to eat... Well I decided to get a torta Cubana & the lady taking the orders told me they were out of pastor... Can you believe that? Tacos el buen \"pastor\" without pastor? I was so freaking frustrated :( I still got the torta tho bc I wasn't going to waste 20 min of my life. But yeah I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone.. Another issue I saw, was the menu they should translate it or at least make it understandable for people that don't speak Spanish and I'm not saying because of me, but because I saw a few ppl in front of me having the hardest time to order because they didn't understand what they were going to eat!"}
{"text":"I've been here before for a taco crawl and been meaning to go back. What I had during the crawl was solid and one of the better stands we visited. When we were with a group of friends at a downtown bar, I took the opportunity to suggest capping the night with some tacos.   So it's not the gentrified part of downtown and is a much more colorful crowd, but calm the fuck down you will be fine. Soon enough they are opening a actual brick and mortar across from the Cardenas market on Decatur and Meadows Ln. While they are building the interior, they have a stand in the parking lot up and running so you can try them there as well.   Tacos are $2 and they also do basics like tortas, burritos, quesadilla, etc.One of the few stands that take cards ($5 minimum to use credit/debit).   I got pastor tacos which were solid like last time. A bit of char crispy bits, the seasoning was good on them and has grease, but not too greasy that it's gross. They dont ask you if you want pineapple, you have to tell them as we didn't get any on ours.   Cabeza was shredded finely so meat and fatty bits is incorporated together well. It was tender and wonderful aside from it could use a tiny bit more salt though I fixed that myself with seasoning it.   I love their pickled onions here at the salsa bar. They're sweet, a little bit of tang and really spicy with the thin slices of ripe habanero chilies what I originally thought was carrot.  Definitely love this spot. Cheap, tasty and open late (3pm til 1am Tue-Sun)."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the taco stand over near downtown so I was excited to go to a sitdown that was in a more convenient location for me to stop on the way home.   My first experience was so-so but I came near closing and the pastor wasn't as good as it could be, but still decent.   Came again in the middle of the day, and it was much, much better flavor and texture of the pastor. We also tried cabeza tacos which were pretty decent fine chop that wasnt too fatty.I also got a small \"plato de birria\" which isn't so much a plate as a bowl of a soup broth with birria in it, plate of onions, cilantro and lime and tortillas on the side. It would have been better if the broth wasn't close to room temperature and was actually hot. I think I'll stick to tacos.   To sweeten the deal, Wednesday is 2 for 1 on pastor tacos - all day. It's not advertised anywhere I stumbled upon it.   The thing that makes it a great spot to stop is the staff is really nice. They've been friendly even when it's near closing and they insist we stay and eat than do to-go. I also like the ordering and paying system way better. I am glad that despite their setup being for those \"express lines\" they nixed it so you can have all hot food, at once.   There's some hiccups to be improved on with consistency, but so far to get some quick tacos in a indoor setup open til late, I am a fan."}
{"text":"Excellent authentic Mexican food. Great menu.  Across from the D on Fremont. Clean restaurant, great service."}
{"text":"If you sort the comments on this place based on the newest first, you'll see that this place hasn't gotten anything under a 4-star rating for almost a year.  I really wonder why that is.  I was craving tacos.  So I went here during my lunch.  I ordered the pastor, cabeza, tripa, and lengua street tacos.  I found none that I liked.  All 4 were pretty bland. The meat was dry and pretty much flavorless, even with the addition of lime, sauces, and sides.  To say that I was disappointed is an understatement.  Actually - maybe it wasn't that bad.  But it wasn't good either.  Mediocre.  But probably less than that.    The orange sauce they had was pretty good, though.  If you go here, make sure to grab lots of this.  Also, finding a parking space in this area was a bit tricky when this area is busy."}
{"text":"One of my favorite taco places. It's super far from me but every time I'm on this side of town I always have to stop by here for a few freshly made tacos.  It's about $2+ per taco. All served with corn tortilla which I personally don't like since I prefer flour tortilla and to get flour tortilla it's an extra $.50 per taco (which sucks bc you would think that it's included, all those $.50s add up haha)   Weds is buy 1 ($2) get the 2nd taco free on the pork taco ..in other words a $1 each"}
{"text":"The al pastor comes with pinapple at no extra cost if you ask for it. It's not greasy at all like all other places I've been to.   The cabeza meat is the best I had. They clean it up so there isn't any pieces or chunks of fat in it. And the best part about them is that they're there all the time =)"}
{"text":"The best I've ever had in my life! I ordered a beef sauce taco, chicken taco, grilled chicken taco, steak taco, and a steak and cheese quesadilla... AMAZING! It was about 3am and a uncontrollable hunger hit me! Excellent remedy!!"}
{"text":"Taqueria El Buen Pastor...aka Tacos el Pastorcito! Little taco stand on LV Blvd and Bonanza, near 95.   I have been overhearing that they have one of the best al pastor in town...So I finally got to put it to the test   First of all, tacos here are pretty cheap. Almost every meat is $1.50, with the Lengua at an even $2.  Pic of the tacos! :  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tacos-el-pastorcito-las-vegas?select=qW-Q6OtVPQMb_-RHQNV7mg#qW-Q6OtVPQMb_-RHQNV7mg  The Al Pastor here was good but not the best in my opinion. The taco felt a little light on the meat, but you do get what you pay for. It had lots of flavor, but not quite as good as the other two spots I have recently tried. I think you will like it, I'm just looking for the best in town!  But what was great was the Lengua! As you can see in the picture, they shred it instead of cubing it, which gave it a nice Barbacoa like consistency, and packed with juices and flavors! I really liked this...the best Lengua taco I have ran into so far!  The Chorizo was nice and flavorful...slightly oily like it should be. Lots of other places in town serve it practically dry...I like juices in my Chorizo!  Lastly, they have a salsa bar area to DIY, and the salsas have plenty of depth and not watery and boring like some other places. Give them a try...they are open late!"}
{"text":"Amazing food. Huge portions. Quick service. Place is a bit cramped but the food makes up for it."}
{"text":"I gotta say the food is not bad. But how is pastor cheaper then carne asada??  The Service is horrible i can stand it but i go there because close to my job. A quesadilla $5.50 with only cheese? Too expensive. I'll just make it myself.."}
{"text":"First time here and they messed up our order but they quickly fix the problem and they are apologetic of it and I think it's nice rather than that the food is good and sauces are good as well we sure coming back again.  Oh by the way we went to the new location at 675 A Mall Ring Circle Henderson area by the galleria mall FYI.  We order torta and they are huge can't finish it and my husband got wet burrito my kids got burritos and chicken fingers they are good food.  4 star only because we have to drive back to get my torta they forgot it but rather than that everything is good."}
{"text":"You know you are about to have amazing tacos when they ask for your order in spanish!! Their pastor is out of this world!!! Get little tacos and they give you cilantro and onions to add as much or as little as you like!! Seriously I would drive 45 to have this yummyness!!!"}
{"text":"Pastor tacos were delish.  Loved the pineapple and salsa bar."}
{"text":"Good tacos.. over priced burritos.. great drunk food for sure .. Parking sucks.. there's only about 6 parking spots in the actual lot so if those are taken u gotta park across the street and walk up"}
{"text":"Warning! This is a drunk review!   So my coworker took me to the hood of Las Vegas claiming this place to be the best taco place in the city. To be honest, I was terrified and am still terrified. But after inhaling the tacos (al pastor with piña-pineapple, lengua, and buche), THESE ARE THEE MOST AMAZING TACOS I'VE HAD MY ENTIRE LIFE. Mind has been BLOWN out of my skull socket. So effin delicious!!!!!  Bring a friend (preferably a Spanish-speaking one) and some mase and come down to the hood to try these tacos. So F*CK*NG GOOD!"}
{"text":"This place is expensive . Pastor and chorizo had no flavor . Asada was dry and burnt . They said it was two for $1 tacos on Thursdays and it was more they made us pay more than that . So they be bulllshitting ."}
{"text":"This is a wonderful restaurant! The staff are friendly and the food is authentic Mexican cuisine. The prices are reasonable, and on Weds they have 2 for 1 pastor tacos, which are delicious! I've taken four of my friends there already, and I'll continue to introduce others to this great food!"}
{"text":"Today was the first time trying Taqueria El Buen Pastor and they are so good, I had the asada and al pastor and they were so yummy definitely coming back"}
{"text":"I don't think so!  Overpriced, and tasteless.  Nada que ver with street tacos.  I totally do not recommend go someplace else which I also can't recommend since I haven't found any good Mexican tacos here in Vegas. What a disappointment with tacos in this city."}
{"text":"Taco Tuesday! We went in for a little bit of a late dinner and it wasn't terribly busy. You order at the counter and they bring your order out to your table. All tacos come plain and you add your toppings at the salsa bar.   We ordered -  Al pastor - they ask if you want pineapple added to the taco. We tried with and without and it's so much better with! The meat is tender, juicy, and flavorful. A must try! Asada - meat was tender with a nicely charred outside, good seasoning Shrimp - decent amount of shrimp, had grilled onions which was a nice addition, the slaw on top was refreshing Carnitas - meat was moist and tender Chorizo - was a bit salty for my liking Chicken Quesadilla - tons of cheese and big chunks of grilled chicken in it. Really good for something so simple.   The salsa bar had the basics - cilantro, onions, pickled carrots, limes, and a few different salsas. The reddish-orange salsa was our favorite. It had a smoky flavor but wasn't spicy at all.   The menu is huge and they have specials. The cashier told me Wednesday's are BOGO for the al pastor tacos so I'll be sure to take advantage of that deal next time."}
{"text":"Omg score. Just found this place. Best salsa bar I ever seen. Wow!!  Want really good real Mexican, all locals this is the real deal."}
{"text":"While visiting I needed something quick  to eat near the Cashman  Center.  So glad I found this place right off the corner of Las Vegas Blvd and bonanza. 1 pastor taco for $2 and bbq fajita  for $8. Stuffed  my face and had a smile for the rest of the day. $10 minimum for debit /credit cards. Really quick  service. Parking available next to the food truck at that tire shop."}
{"text":"This place is a must go to when visiting Vegas. Best Al Pastor in the state... No one comes close to this state. I highly recommend this location."}
{"text":"Open late is a ++ and great food wow just surprised me , had the Huarache which is great! Fresh and hot."}
{"text":"CLIMAX CITY!  Best food truck of my life!  Sincronizada, Gringa, Atascate Chon...ADD GREEN SAUCE"}
{"text":"An interview brought me to Vegas for about 36 hours. Now, the Strip is an awful place for any kind of food, or so my hosts who have lived in Vegas for a while, told me. Trouble is, I thought this food truck was reasonably away from all the neon. Apparently not.  I asked for tacos with chicken. There was a self-service station for toppings (salsa, onions, olives etc.). The ingredient quality was appalling, the meat was poorly cooked and grossly overdone; the flavor (presumably from the convenience store oil used for frying) was inconsistent and mediocre. I don't favor the idea of putting a station for toppings on the side of the road anyway. In my experience, food trucks tend to use the limited real estate to make choices on behalf of customers. This tends to get them their often-unique identity. The do-it-your-way vibe is a lot more suited for Moe's or Chipotle.  Bit of a disappointment."}
{"text":"So glad to finally have real Mexican tacos  Not like Roberto's and all those crappy places  Great customer service  Definitely going back  Great location too!"}
{"text":"My husband and son found this place recently and let me tell you! Finally, found a restaurant that serves authentic Mexican tacos/combos. They have everything from beef, chicken, pork, tongue and cheeks. We recommend this place!"}
{"text":"This is the real deal. Probably my current favorite taco spot in all of Vegas. Swung by here at the crack of dawn and wolfed down a pollo, asada, and pastor taco in record time. Their salsa bar offers a spicy green salsa and a medium orange one - not sure what's in either but they're both quality. Lightning-fast service, friendly service - can't beat it. Especially not for $2 a taco."}
{"text":"It was early in the morning around 6:30am. I wasn't planned to stop by but those two hard workers also the smell dragged me there and gave it a try! Lol Good thing they had a salad bar you can put any kinds of veggies and sauces for your food. Also it was tasty! Why not 5 stars?  :) haha"}
{"text":"Solid choice that we stumbled across that was filled with locals which have us more confidence.  The tacos pastor and hurache was delicious.  Great find!"}
{"text":"I've eaten at Taqueria El Buen Pastor on two annual trips to downtown Vegas. I love the tacos--my favorite are the Tacos de Pastor with pineapple, but the Tacos de Asada are good, too. Note, when you add fixin's to your tacos from the buffet trays near the front, there are some additional sauces near the back of the restaurant in front of the large pork rotisserie (like a gyro spool). I had a little chile de arbol sauce to heat things up a bit. These street tacos will not disappoint!"}
{"text":"The absolute best place to end the night!  After a long night partying, just when you get the need for some food, this is the place to hit!  Tacos, Tortas, quesadillas are delicious!  The condiments and salsas they offer is what puts them over the top.  We definitely recommend this place and will now make this a Vegas tradition."}
{"text":"This place is so dreadful no music playing and very dry atmosphere,food was so taste less we had 2 tacos de carne asada that where 5 bucks a piece which had the bigger tortillas the meat tasted as if it was tossed in a bunch of oil and old because it was so hard to chew, the carne asada fries tasted like chicken wings maybe because the grease it was cooked in and they fries where so over cooked, the nacho cheese was clumpy and gross,the salsa was flavorless and not spicy,I was so disappointed with this place I had high expectations of this place but let down quickly when I tasted the food."}
{"text":"Decided to make a stop here after doing the SkyJump off Stratosphere because... WHY NOT!  NOTE: This is a food truck situated in a parking lot. There are no chairs or tables - either eat your stuff standing up or take it home.    Hubbers went for three tacos al pastor.   Cousin went for two chicken tacos.   I went for the steak quesadilla.   Condiments are aplenty. There are containers available to pack and wrap. Foil and plastic bags also available with the cashier.   That was probably one of the better quesadillas I've had. I felt they got a bit skimpy on the meat considering it was $9/order, but the flavor of the meat was right on.   Hubbers and cousin also liked their orders. Like the quesadilla, tacos were a little pricier than what we're accustomed to.   HOWEVER! This is Vegas, so..."}
{"text":"It's been a few weeks since I was here so hopefully things have changed... This review is being made after two identical visits.   The food: Decent, not great... not terrible, just average.  The wait: Came in at lunch, it took forever for the cashier to ring us up. Then we were mischarged and had to sort that out. The food also took excessively long to come out. They were not crowded either.   Price: Seemed excessive for what you get. Nothing really stood out for the price paid.   I was really excited they came to Henderson. I've eaten at the Buen Pastor locations in the north and it was really good. This location has missed the mark :("}
{"text":"9 dollars for a Torta!!! And they only give you 3 slices of avocado!! Dude the torta is bigger then my face and your only giving us 3 freaking slices!!! Not cool!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Taco spot in Las Vegas!  I've had everything they don't have anything that I do not like just things I love more! Al Pastor is 1st and top notch even the pastor style onions if that's what they are are amazing!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure how it happened, but somehow Justin G. and I ended up going to the wrong taco stand on the UYE Tacolympics. We ended up here (address is correct on this listing as we were off of Eastern and Poppy.   We headed out early from stop #2 because it smelled like natural gas - plus we wanted to get to stop #3 first. We show up and nobody from Yelp was there so we ordered. Lengua and cabeza for me, pastor for Justin. When I saw the menu, I thought it was going to be the exact same as the second stop, as the prices were the same. Meh!   Fortunately, despite the prices, the food was hands down the best of the night - which is saying something. After eating 3 street tacos, I'd say having two more should have made me think \"ugh, just okay\" but these were noticibly tastier. I felt like I was going to explode because I was so full, but they were declicious. While there, I ended up buying a flower pen from a girl and her family that were trying to raise money. I figure it was a decent dollar well spent.   Now, back to the UYE - nobody showed up. We were wondering if maybe everyone died in a natural gas explosion back at stop number 2. After being at this place for more than half an hour, we dipped and figured something must have changed. We decided to hit up a party downtown and while driving there, passed a stand full of cars - yep, the 3rd UYE stop. Oh well, our last stop was really good so it's okay.  While they weren't as wonderful as the tacos I've had ocean side in Mexico, these were pretty good for Las Vegas. If the price came down a tad, I'd be a fan."}
{"text":"Authentic decent food with nice service but way too overpriced for the location. I ordered a $9 carnitas burrito which came with 3 chips, 3 whole chips with chippy crumbs.  You are better off going to Don Tortaco."}
{"text":"YUM!  I stumbled upon this little hole in the wall (literal) on a whim a few years ago.  Now it is always a scheduled stop when I visit Fremont!  I absolutely love their asada nachos and cannot get enough chicken tacos!  The meat is juicy and flavorful and the tortillas are out of this world.  Everything is made fresh and I've never had a bad experience.    The only downside is it's literally one hallway that you order on the right and there is a ledge on the left with a few stools.  If you want a sit down experience or have a big group (like more than 4) you'll be disappointed.  If you're okay with eating standing up make sure to pop in here for some bomb, authentic Mexican food!"}
{"text":"So I didn't know a thing about this place.  I used to see people queued up at the food truck location on LVB and Bonanza and wondered why there were so many people at food truck in a tire shop parking lot.    I noticed this location when it first opened.  I live in the area and frequent the Target across the street all the time.    I was craving some tacos and decided to give them a try.  Great idea.  These tacos are pretty yum.  I liked the flavor of the meats and I especially liked how they presented the lengua.  The only problem I had was that I asked for pineapple in the pastor and I didn't see or taste it.  I brought it back to her and said I didn't think there was pineapple and she was like it's there, it's grilled with the pork.  Hmmm.... from the pics on Yelp (and from my tastebuds), I didn't get pineapple.    I really liked the salsa bar.  The veg looked fresh and the salsas were good.  I kind of wish they had a super hot one but I liked the flavors they did have.    Definitely gonna make this a frequented taco shop for me."}
{"text":"Chicken wet burrito was the best I've had in Vegas so far. I think I've found my new spot for Mexican food. The chicken was grilled perfectly. Nice and crispy!  It was so delicious I woke up thinking about how good it was lol (I know, fat moment). Seriously though, I'm about to go get another one.  My only complaint is that the bathroom smells really bad.. it wasn't really dirty but the smell is so bad that you can smell it before you actually open the restroom door. If you guys can work that out I'll be back to bump this rating to 5  **** Update*** I'm dropping another star because the last 2 times I've come here my order has been incorrect. I don't get it. The first time was perfect and I've asked for the exact same order each time.. consistency is key.  ***update*** 4/29/18 The carne asada fries are a no go... first off they charge 11.50! The fries are comparable to mashed potatoes and they use nacho cheese -__-"}
{"text":"These tacos are hands down the best I've ever had. Friendly service and super cheap. 2$ usd per taco. We walked 20 minutes from freemont st to get there. Worth every step and penny. I had chorizo and pastor"}
{"text":"Empezaron muy bien pero desgraciadamente van bajando sus estándares de calidad, por que tienen un trompo para tacos al pastor si los van a hacer en la plancha y quemados, los de la que ponen se ven muy diferentes a los que te sirven, saldrían major si los hacen como los originales directo del trompo"}
{"text":"Go here...drive take a cab or walk hands down order the pastor burrito and tacos you'll thank me later ...it might be located on sketch street and WTF am I but it's a great meal and awesome pricing"}
{"text":"I moved to the Vegas area in August but had yet to try any of the Mexican food places out here. Disclaimer: I'm from California where fresh, authentic Mexican food exists everywhere. Anyway, moving on. I drove by this place on the way to the bank and we decided to head back later that night to try it.  They specialize in al pastor tacos. When I arrived, I was greeted and offered an al pastor taco to try for free! Of course I took it. Delicious! And got off the grill. So I ordered a chicken burrito for my husband, and three tacos for me (al pastor, pollo and carne asada) plus a side of beans and rice.  Everything. Was. Delicious. The sauces were good and I like that they have the fixings at a bar setup so you can decide what you want in your taco. They had a few \"American\" dishes like chicken fingers and a burger, but if that's what you want, why are you even here?  Long story short: authentic, fresh, hot, and tasty. We will be back. Soon."}
{"text":"HEY Y'ALL. I'm finALLY DONE. DONE LOOKIng foR THE bEST TACOS IN LAS VEGAS.  My super homesick self to California street tacos took me to this place, and you best believe, it took me back. Their CARNE ASADA TACOS are AMAAAAZING. The steak is marinated, and has seasoning and FLAVOR! Their spiciest green sauce is the PERFECT complement for this taco.   The pastor tacos are really good too, with the pineapple, but I'm a die hard carne asada fan. Every thing I've eaten here has been LEGIT.   Carne asada tacos- 5/5.  Lengua tacos- 5/5.  It's not gummy like the beef tongue at KBBQ. It is soft and tender and you'd think you're eating braised pork or beef.  Al Pastor Tacos- 4/5. Carne Asada Burrito- 5/5  IT ACTUALLY has RICE IN IT like California with you asking or adding or paying extra!!!! Only place in vegas I've found that it comes with it!  BBQ FAjita Burrito - 5/5.  If you like BBQ flavors, you will LOVE THIS burrito. The fajita has a nice bbq flavor and it is PACKED with grilled bell peppers, onions, and maybe even red peppers?   And last but not least...THE HORCHATA is amazing. I don't even LIKE horchata nor do I order it EVER. Maybe twice in my lifetime I've had it prior, and I am a huge fan because of this place. It's NOT WATERED DOWN at all (which is why I never order this stuff). And it is PACKED with flavor and cinnamon is strong. SO GOOD.  DO IT LIKE NIKE."}
{"text":"To crowded a lot of drunks Seating  suck. food more expensive than other locations Freemont st of course lol Is ok to bring your own drink ....slow service   Gate down 75 % by 1115 pm close  kindda leaving all the guests trapped inside  too early for  a first Friday night."}
{"text":"Still a good place  good food is been less than  it use to be  before condiments cart needs to be more clean  but is hard to keep up with that .lol frendly  parking attend. ...lol Keeps bums for harassing customers  I don't mind it to much but on this area it may be a problem if is not control ..."}
{"text":"These tacos were better than any taco I had in California! The beef tongue was oh so tender and the chicken/pork tacos didn't disappoint either. While is traditional to have homemade condiments at most Spanish places on the west coast, these were different. Maybe made with a little more love? Maybe I added too much rum to the fabulous horchata? Who cares?! These tacos are a must if your in Vegas. Take the walk, cab, uber/Lyft, he'll bike there for all I care. Just buy tacos chat up the nice mami taking your money then sit on the curb and enjoy those tacos. Then my friend order more."}
{"text":"Man this place is pretty good! If you like street tacos, give it a shot. I'm from Phoenix and this place pretty good and prices are decent. This is small and divey but I'd come back"}
{"text":"Best. Tacos. In. Vegas.  You lookin' for that real street taco? Well this is the place to get it at!!!! So fresh and delicious. Made to order. Not expensive at all. You pay per Taco but honestly it's worth it. They have a condiment bar with a bunch of sides. I recommend getting limes and squeezing it on them bad boys. There's no tables or chairs cause it's street corner tacos, we usually sit on the ground on the side. I definitely recommend this place if you're in the area. You'll smell it from miles away. Authentic, delicious Mexican food! Literally, you can't beat this place."}
{"text":"My hairdresser is from Guadalajara, and about a week ago she and I started bitching about how bad LV Mexican food is. We even bitched about how the Tex-Mex sucks ever since Margarita's Cantina got blown up in 06. Well, she told me that the only good Al Pastor in Las Vegas is located on Bonanza road near the \"shitty part of town\". I drove down Bonanza from Rancho all the way to Hollywood, and this was the only street taco stand I could find. I just assumed this had to be the place. She was right, it was really good. Just out of personal preference, I still like Taco Taco on Trop better because of the unique seasoning. But, I enjoyed the slices of pineapples that TACOS EL PASTORCITO put in my al pastor taco, and they had this special salsa that was bright orange and tasted like Mexican Tan Tan Men. 3 Al Pastor tacos only ended up being $4.50, and they were pretty big compared to other street tacos. The service was extremely friendly and one of the cooks was really good at setting boundaries for the large homeless population in the area. TACOS EL PASTORCITO is located in the parking lot of a Llantera place, right across the street from a Siegel Suites and what I believe was possibly the wreckage of a UFO(you will see what I mean when you get there). When you wait in line, you will be confronted by multiple druggies and homeless who will either ask you: \"You got a cigarette I can borrow?\", or \"Got 50 cents so I can catch the bus?\".  Well, the cook does a great job screaming aggressive things in Spanish to these people and getting them to run back into the alley for a while. Usually a couple of minutes later they come creeping back out and then the angry cooks starts yelling again... this cycle continues all night long.  I also  liked the regular customers. Most of them are older Mexican men who like to talk about professional boxing. I had a fun conversation while waiting for my tacos."}
{"text":"This is a good place and i like it, but it needs to improve in timing and customer service. People are too busy running around and don't pay enough attention to customers. As a new business is hard to get it right the first time and im sure it will only get better. 4 Stars for good prices, location, decoration and good food."}
{"text":"I was really disappointed because the service here was rhorrible. The short Hispanic girl has a nasty attitude and no customer service skills. But the tall women was very nice. The gucamole was disgusting because it was made with too much bad onions. I've been sick ever since. The owners are really nice and wish the taco truck was still open at Las Vegas Blvd and Bonanza because the service there was amazing. Also disappointed because you guys no longer serve mulitas and the salsa bar hardly had anything in it."}
{"text":"About time we find an authentic Taqueria! Absolutely love the friendly service and how every question I had was answered with great detail. I will be back here again soon!"}
{"text":"Bad. The tacos are not good. Cold. Hard. Tortillas were probably out for awhile. I don't know what else to say other than save your money and go have tacos elsewhere."}
{"text":"Best taqueria I have ever bin to by far . Your enchiladas are wildly delicious , And may I add you habanero Salsa is to die for I'm a die hard chile  eater  . I recommend this place 100%"}
{"text":"The food here is over priced and no free refills. The two tacos were very good. The employee's were very nice and sanitary.  I spent $14.04 for two tacos, chips and a drink. This was delicious food,  just think it was expensive for Mexican food."}
