{"text":"The food is good. The atmosphere is good but pretty loud. The have somebody playing the piano. BUT THE SERVICE IS HORRIBLE!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I just returned, having used a gift certificate issued by the restaurant because my experience last time was so bad.
The service is horrible. Instead of having areas, they seem to assign wait-staff all over the restaurant, so you can have a waiter in charge of tables at opposite ends of the restaurant. Last time, the issue was in large part because they were so under-staffed. This evening they had proper staffing but still couldn't manage. Everything is just one beat off from the rhythm that would make this a good restaurant.
The food is just okay. Honestly, I'd rather go to Brennan's Colony down the street for more attentive service and good food -- maybe not the wine selection but a better overall experience.
You'll see by reading my other reviews, that I'm pretty generous with the stars -- it tell s you something that I feel one star in this instance is just."}
{"text":"This is our fourth visit in the past 6 months.   Every time we go here, we wonder why it doesn't get 5 stars.  Full disclosure - we eat out a lot, but seldom order entrees since we like the variety that several appetizers give us.  If that's the way you like to nosh, then you have to come here - especially during happy hour.  We had 4 glasses of wine (very good pinot grigio, kick ass petite syrah) at $5 each.  Appetizers are half price during happy hour.  We splurged and shared the arugula salad - beautifully presented, nuts, fruits, cheese and just the right amount of dressing.  Then we had the soup of the day (fabulous chowder) the flatbread of the day (arugula, pepperoni, beef) and the stuffed peppers.  All under $50.  Great food, great service, welcoming environment....what more could you want on a Saturday night after a day of yardwork?"}
{"text":"I have never been so disrespected by a business owner.  The owner himself, Raj Singh came over and verbally used racist remarks against the group I was with.  To be honest as a business owner myself, dining with other entrepreneurs and executive level management, we were verbally assaulted,  dinnegrated,  and set aside. As a staunch supporter of Cleveland Heights and a multiple home owner in the area  and a true supporter of the Lee Rd. And a friend  ( for over 3 decades) I cannot recommend his establishments as I'm very dissapointed.  My commendations will be made at the next city council meeting about both of his businesses.   His business practices are unacceptable for what Lee Rd.  and Cleveland Heights has to offer."}
{"text":"It's my second time to this restaurant, great food and very good service !! We really like the Peking duck , big shrimps , lobsters and crabs ! Usually Chinese food can be oily and too salty , but not here ! Will be back again !!"}
{"text":"Great decor except for the tacky butcher block tables!  We were seated immediately on a Friday night.  The waitress was attentive.  The  presentation was great but there was very little taste - incredibly bland!  The drinks were either sugary or bland!  We had scallops with risotto - the scallops were ok and the risotto was chewy!  The calamari was a soup type dish - quite strange!  The crab appetizer was sweet - also quite strange!  I understand why there are open tables on a Friday!  So sad!  Add some zip to the menu and you would not have empty tables!  To offer oil and balsamic vinegar for the bread but no spices.........no need to return!"}
{"text":"French-inspired small plates. Knowledgeable friendly staff. Nice, clean atmosphere. Upcoming special events look interesting. Large drink menu."}
{"text":"When you in Las Vegas, this is one restaurant you must visit. Beautiful decor, clean, and staffs are friendly. The menu offered many speciality dishes. They have fresh eel which I didn't think I would like was delicious. The curry crab was the bomb. Just eating the curry sauce and steam rice was already so good. The string bean was fresh and crunchy, not soggy like most places.  We ordered wine with our meal.  The bill was reasonable and affordable. Will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with the fam before a show at the Dobama Theatre and had a great experience. 

Food was pretty good and no real complaints. My dad and I had their soup of the day, french onion soup. It was delicious, so delicious that I couldn't stop talking about it. For entrees, I ordered the duck and got to taste the veal francaise and the chicken. My duck was cooked perfectly--so tender and succulent. The veal francaise and chicken were equally good, but I preferred my duck. 

Service was good, but a little slow at times. Our server had a large section though and we could tell he was busy, so we understood."}
{"text":"Intimate atmosphere. Food was excellent. Veal piccata was terrific. Will definitely go back. Also have parking in the rear which can be a bit challenging in the area."}
{"text":"Excellent true Chinese food. Victor our waiter paid a great deal of attention to us and provided flawless service."}
{"text":"Warning: If you plan to use a Restaurant.com gift card, you MUST bring a printed version of your certificate. They will not accept your cell phone version (like most restaurants), claiming they need the paper version for IRS purposes. I get it - if you get audited, it's handy to have around. BUT they will mislead you, and they will not tell you this information up front. 

Here's what happened: we arrived and were seated by the manager, who proceeded to tell us about specials, wine specialties, an extra party room in the back, available parking, etc. (some useful, some not). Then he showed us some special menu and indicated this was not available for Restaurant.com gift certificates. At that point, we informed him that's why we were there. He told us the gift certificate does not cover that menu nor Saturdays. What he failed to mention was the little caveat about the paper requirement. Funny how he thought we would have a better experience if informed about some of the limitations of the gift certificate, but not this other, very important one (fyi, I don't care about the Saturday exception - we were there on a Thursday). It wasn't until we handed the waitress our check with the certificate number written on it that we were informed of their policy. A subsequent conversation with the manager was to no avail - he was lightly laughing about it, and indicated this had happened before. Don't you think at that point he either has a duty to tell Restaurant.com this information so they can put it on the website, or  tell people when they walk in and indicate they have such a gift certificate that it must be in paper form so they can make an educated decision on whether to stay or not? 

As for the food: we had the duck with mustard mashed potatoes and substituted seasonal vegetables for the ham, bacon and corn risotto, and the chicken saltinbocca with the side of green beans. Impressed by the duck. The chicken and green beans were good, not great, and the chicken wasn't worth $20. The potatoes and risotto were disappointing. Wine was good, but $6 a glass (cheapest glass of red) for a pinot noir. Bread at the beginning of the meal was stingy, but good.

Waitress was nice and helpful. 

Atmosphere was okay."}
{"text":"I like everything about this resturante. 
Price and value first your money was good. Ambiance was what I call casual elegance. There is an excellent Wine selection and the craft cocktails were delish #buthatfoodthough. 

The food was better than some of the higher end restuarante I have been to. My server Mike, was great very friendly and fast with our appetizers and our meal  We found this establishment on a humble,  but  we will be back. Try the stuffed peppers, the lamb chops and the crab stuff salmon. All very flavorful, tender and nicely presented"}
{"text":"We arried at 7 and left at 8:45. The atmosphere is nice. I had a great pinot noir and the sesame ahi tuna was great.  The beet salad  is great and the hazelnut ice cream and chocolate mousse is awesome. The drawbacks were that my wifes lamb chop was a little burnt, but they fixed it. The service was slow, and not in a good way. When we placed our drink order it took 5 to 10 minutes to get our drink. I  sent back my 2nd glass of wine because it arrived so late in my meal. 
I gave them 4 stars because I hope that their service will improve to the level of their  food."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, way over priced! Poor quality of meats, ordered the french filet mignon - very fatty & rough, lack of flavor; black bean chicken - although chicken breast full of fat, tendons, lack of flavor; crispy chicken 1/2 - best overall, great flavor & texture but very small portion especially for $13. It appears that for the price, it's not worth it, the cut of meats is more like trimmings you would discard but yet they serve it to you and charge a ridiculous amount for it."}
{"text":"Great time sitting at bar for a meal - impromptu night out with my husband and happy we ended up at Taste. The bartender, Billy, was attentive without being hovering and had wine recommendations that were valid without being clear up sells. We had beet salad as appetizer, then my husband had paella and I had shrimp scampi (with house made linguini, so good) for dinner. Sorbet for dessert. My only objection to food was chef using subpar tomatoes (almost white in color and tough) in scampi. My thought is leave tomatoes out or use canned tomatoes if those tomatoes are only option (which makes sense in winter). 
We had a great night and we'll be back - hopefully sitting @ bar again."}
{"text":"I was excited when I saw an authentic Chinese restaurant opening up on the sw side of town and it's close to me. Had the chance to try it this Saturday aug 19th and wasn't too impressed. 
1- inside was clean since the building was brand new. Nice decor. Typical Chinese stuff. 
2- food was ok. We order appetizer pig ears with peanuts.  Lacked flavor. Probably should've let it marinated a lot longer. Clams with black bean sauce was ok. Chinese broccoli with salted fish. Broccoli was over cooked. No crunch to it. Was soft. Then we got fresh steam fish which was good. 
Wish was more scallions on it. 
3- rice cost extra?? Since when do you charge for a bowl of rice. Two of us order 4 dishes. And the usual Cantonese restaurant gives you free house soup. Not this place. No soup or free rice = not good. I rather just drive to Chinatown. 
4- wait staff was your typical Cantonese restaurant. After our waitress took our order we didn't see her again. Food came out really spread apart. Got the clams first. Then Marinade pig ears. 15 min later the fish. And lastly when we almost done with dinner the broccoli came out."}
{"text":"Very good restaurant. Peking duck was awesome. Have to do the 2 rounds. The salt pepper tofu is also very good. Im still trying new dishes. So far no disappointment!"}
{"text":"Opened November 12, 2008.  Contemporary decor. Lots of light wood and light.  Upscale pricing but food, service and decor make it a great value.  Menu has the only the basics:  beef, fish, scallops/lobster, vegetarian, and pork, period.  No salad. Beet carpaccio appetizer has lots of fresh baby spinach leaves as option to salad.  Six side dishes--vegetables.  Vegetables with entrées and as sides are uniformly great (I'm a vegetarian). Outstanding plating (appearance of food).  Outstanding veggie and fish entrées. Bread (Stone Oven) costs $1.50.  Yes, it looks like $15.00 on the menu.  Clearly visible in everything food wise is the chef's (French national) roots.  Probably even the charge for bread comes from those roots.  Larry the owner must be the oenophile here.  Long large bar with two large screen TV's on requisite ESPN.  Pride of place to wine cabinet and shelving.  Excellent service--probably more servers than needed at this early stage of the restaurant's life.  Second Saturday night filled up virtually to the max. Word of mouth must be working overtime here.  Convenient, pay City parking in rear off side street shares with Library. Looks like a winner for everyone from customers to Cleveland Hts and the neighborhood."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like Taste but it just left me feeling \"meh.\"  We went on a Friday night and were seated immediately.  The host seemed a bit snotty but whatever.  Our server was fantastic, so attentive.  I ordered the pumpkin soup and stuffed chicken and my boyfriend ordered the pork chop.  Our biggest complaint was the lack of seasoning.  Both of our entrees were bland.  My soup was amazing and I probably would have been better off just ordering a second bowl.  The accompaniments for both dishes were overcooked and blah.  I can't say that I would ever choose to go back.  For the price I expected more."}
{"text":"Finally, a tasty Chinese restaurant in local Las Vegas that is just like eating in Los Angeles. They sell lots of seafood which I enjoy a lot, and they even have lunch specials that are very affordable. I will definitely try it next time."}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant with attentive customer service. We got seated pretty quickly during lunch time . I liked their fishball porridge and the beef stew noodle soup was especially delicious. I would recommend this place to my friends and family and will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Friendly management, great creative food and a nice ambiance make Taste a regular stop for us."}
{"text":"Had the Sunday brunch..think it is new....really great food, everything but the kind of uncooked potatoes...but french toast was the bomb, lemon pancakes superb, the meats are top-notch, so if we hadn't ordered the potatoes I believe I'd have given a 5 star rating. Try this place!! Support a French restaurant in Cleveland Heights!"}
{"text":"Great food and wine served consistently.  Carla is the epitome of a fantastic server.  She's become more like family than just a server.  Gotti likewise is a phenomenal server.  The employees treat loyal customers well.  We have a young baby, and the staff always works hard to accommodate our family."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch.
It was delicious! Scallion pancakes are soooo yummy. Nice environment. Great service from a very friendly waitress. We will be back."}
{"text":"I've been to Taste four times now in the past year!  I went last year for Restaurant Week and it's had me coming back every time.  The food is quite delicious - no matter what you have.  Their salads are terrific especially when you add the salmon.  Such a nice sear! Pasta is perfectly cooked and the sauces obviously had a knowledgeable chef making them. The appetizers (Arrancini, Pommes Frites) are large portions and so well made.  The food is upscale.

I would give it five stars but I think the prices are just a bit up there.  Dinner for two with drinks will run you close to $150 with tip.  They have a regular prix fixe menu that is nice, but the price was recently raised to $55 and you get charged even more for some of the meals.  It's definitely a nice spot and great foot, but it has to be a special occasion kind of place because of the price for me.  They do have a very nice happy hour though - which is how I've been back four times :D"}
{"text":"The food was okay, been to other Chinese restaurants that are far better than this one. 

The service was the slowest that i have been. From the time they sat us down, took our orders, placed them on our tables. They took 30 minutes to deliver our food!! Just for 3 orders!!!! Seriously?!!! They were only fast on getting the check. The tea is lukewarm when it is supposed to be hot. Waiter didn't even bother to check on us

Wont come back"}
{"text":"A good choice for a family dinner. Love the more updated decor and clean look. Our waiter seemed to recognize my parents so our experience with service is biased but it seemed pretty efficient and helpful. Not a budget dinner option but the entrees are presented well, cooked well, and tasted delicious. The salt and pepper fried pork chops were superb. Dry sauteed string beans were good, but I would have preferred a bit more \"sear\" or \"char\" to them. The white wine chicken was just ok with not a lot of flavor. I think the quality of the entrees probably depend on what you order, but given the overall picture I rounded up from 3.5 to 4 stars. This is probably a good place for large parties or family events as well if you're interested in a banquet-type option as there are ample tables and seats."}
{"text":"I came here for Happy Hour before seeing a movie at Cedar Lee. There are a lot of food options to choose from during happy hour. I got a glass of red wine for $5 and 2 small plates for under $6 each. The shrimp was full of flavor and cooked perfectly. The food presentation matches the clean lines of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Christopher's review below is much more involved than I will be, but its also very spot-on.  Taste is a lovely place with great food, kind staff, and a delightful environment.  

My family ended up at Taste after the Rockette's around christmas kinda randomly and were very pleasantly surprised... my nephew (age 2) had to join us and the staff and owners went ABOVE AND BEYOND to try to keep him calm and enjoying a place that he really shouldn't have been.

We had a delightful bottle of wine (uh, 2) and a variety of the entrees.

I had the veggie chausson (french for FLAKY and AMAZING) and it literally melted in my mouth.  My one sister had the the scallops which were buttery and lovely... my other sister had the chicken spring rolls which were fresh and tasty.  My dad (who hates veggies) had the sirloin steak which he enjoyed and he even at the Jerusalem artichokes and really enjoyed them! Finally, my mother regarded the rack of lamb as succulent.

I would have loved to try the desserts, but I was too stuffed!

My fam left and I had a drink at the bar and they took great care of me!

Next time, I'd love to have a normal sans-nephew meal so I could enjoy the place again!"}
{"text":"Happy hour was perfect! We had the Arancini di Riso and it was excellent. Fernando was our bartender and server and he took great care of us."}
{"text":"Decent food in a non-Chinatown location.  Food quality is similar to other restaurants of the same genre so if you're in the area, it's worth a try."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with family last night for the first time since opening. As some may have previously said, the owner of this restaurant also owns the Ohana Hawaiian BBQ restaurant chain, which he also had put a new location next door as well. This entire building was newly built and renovated just for these two restaurants. 

The interior design of the location is very nice and elegant. Upon entry of the restaurant, a large chandelier with a large glass wine shelf to the left. The restaurant space has about 10 large tables with about another 8 smaller tables. They also have 2 separate private rooms in the back with 1 large table each, but the rooms are NOT connectable. The private rooms has a karaoke machine as well. 

Service was quick and we had placed our orders pretty fast after we decided. First thing to come out was the Peking Duck, served two ways. The duck will be brought whole on a cart for a live demonstration of the cutting of the hot, SUPER CRISPY skin cut to serving size portions and plated to be eaten with fresh, steamed buns, chives, cucumbers, and green onions, topped with hoisin sauce. That is the first way to eat it. After the skin is removed and served, the rest of the meat and carcass is returned to the kitchen, meat removed and diced, and cooked to be served as lettuce wraps. Piping hot diced duck meat and other veggies wrapped in a crisp iceberg lettuce cups. YUM ! 

We had also ordered snow pea leaves w/ garlic, fried salt & pepper pork (this was accidental as we changed it during the order but i guess the waitress didnt hear it, but its ok), large pork intestine with preserved veggies and bell peppers, black pepper beef on a sizzling plate, seafood tofu casserole. 

Overall most dishes were pretty decent. The only weird one was the black pepper beef on a sizzling plate. The beef used was not cubed or in larger pieces like most/all other restaurants but slices like you'd get from dry beef chow fun, and a severe lack of black pepper as it was as expensive of a spice like saffron. Lol 

The unique thing is this place does not serve rice in a pot, but served in individual bowls. Pros and Cons. Pros, it looks nicer on presentation. Cons is it requires a waiter/waitress assistance for refills, and sometimes it may not be as hot (weird that it should be since they should theoretically be taking it from the rice cooker). 

Overall, a good restaurant. Nice setting. Good for those who live on the SW side (mountains edge, etc) from not having to travel too far (chinatown, etc) for decent chinese food (no i hate panda express. thats not chinese food. id rather not eat than eat that)"}
{"text":"We came in late night on a Wednesday (25 min before closing) worried they wouldn't be able to serve us but they were more than gracious and hospitable. Meals come with lovely hot tea. We ordered pot stickers (so fresh!), war wonton soup (amazing!) kung pow chicken & Mongolian beef. My boyfriend said it was the best Chinese food in Vegas!! We were very happy."}
{"text":"Came here for my daughters baptismal dinner. It was okay, pricey for what you get. You should Skip the dungeoness crab. Place is new and clean. Your paying for their upscale decor. I've ate at hole in the wall Chinese places and their food taste much better."}
{"text":"I came here on a date.  We requested outside seating, but once we got there, the weather and the view (a simple street & gas station) convinced us that inside would probably be a better choice.  The hostess switched our tables with no problems- and I was so glad we did because the inside decor was great.  Really sophisticated without trying too hard.

The food and service was excellent, fast, and delicious.  I suggest going for the prixe fix meal.  It's a great savings and I walked away feeling satisfied and stuffed!  I got the lamb, and my boyfriend ordered the salmon with crab.  Both were cooked perfectly, and both of our plates were clean. 

The wine selection is extensive, but not overwhelming.  The prices were fair and I plan on returning with my boyfriend again for dessert and a bottle of wine. The owners are kind and the crowd is enjoyable.  I would definitely suggest this place if you want to a nice dinner in Cleveland!"}
{"text":"It was ok. Just ok. The server never smiled but was efficient enough. The salad was really good, very fresh and dressed perfectly but I found my fish highly over cooked. I would try it again..."}
{"text":"Mixed feelings about this place. Probably the slowest service I've ever experienced, especially at a Chinese place that's usually rushing you. We got there on a Wednesday night at 7:30 and they told us just a second for a party of 7. But ended up taking exactly an hour get seated. We tried to order our food as quickly as possible since it was already 8:30. The food probably took about 35-40 minutes to come. The servers seemed really new with their jobs and didn't know how to \"serve\" us. 

The food was good, though. I really enjoyed it. I especially liked their peking duck, which they cut and serve right in front of you!

I would probably come back again on a day not during dinner rush or try to make a reservation.  I can't pass up a Chinese place with good quality food right by my house!"}
{"text":"Nice addition to Cleveland Heights.  Food presentation is good.  Kid friendly too.  They brought my son sparkling water in a champagne glass for his birthday."}
{"text":"Went to dinner on Saturday night. It was my third time here but my first time for dinner. I had 12 guests with me for dinner. We ordered live eel, yes live eel. Ordered lobster with basil, chow mein, eggplant, and about 8 other things. I can say the food was good and the portions were above average for a Chinese restaurant.

The service was excellent and the prices were reasonable. 

I will be going back so



*update* we ordered the duck tonight and it was good."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place out with our family from CA. Great food, lovely ambiance and great service! We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"They never fail to surprise me with a delightful culinary surprise every time I visit.  They have amazing salads and seafood; clever and creative bartenders.  I have yet to ever have a bad experience here.  A Napali owner, from Kathmandu, is probably the reason this place keeps getting better and better."}
{"text":"A few of my gal pals came to Taste to celebrate a friend's engagement with a few glasses of wine. It was very sophisticated but comfortable experience. The service was superb, although the chef left before completing our order. We were giving a complimentary cheese and crackers plate, which was delicious. I wasn't expecting such a large selection of wine in Cleveland Heights, I would love to go back when the chef is there and sample the food selection."}
{"text":"This place was mostly empty at 10 pm on a friday night. The service was good, the waitress was nice, knowledgeable, and attentive. The menu is a little limited, but does have a good variety from vegetarian to poultry, seafood, and beef. The prix-fixe menu looked like a good deal and included some wine.

Unfortunately everything we had (crab appetizer, chicken and duck entrees) were slightly too bland to be really enjoyable. There was nothing wrong with the flavors, but nothing really stood out! For the price, I would expect a more memorable experience."}
{"text":"Space:
It is very spacious, they have a bar space, tables for small parties, tables for big parties and two private rooms. 

Service:
They were friendly and the food came out pretty quickly. There weren't that many people when we went so their staff was very tentative to us. 

Price:
The price of the food was pretty expensive compared to other spots in Vegas but if you're coming from out of town, It ranges from where you come from. Since I live in California, most the food here was cheaper than what we find in the Bay Area. 

Food: 
The fish ball with vegetables was really unique and delicious. I would rate that dish a 5 star because I have never had It at other Cantonese spots, however the rest of the food would get an average of 3 stars. 

Notes: 
It is not crowded at all so if you're in a hurry but want something nice, this place seems pretty awesome!"}
{"text":"Great place for Chinese food without going to Chinatown! It's new and very clean. The food is really tasty! Ordered the roast duck,  sizzling beef,  and ong choy.. Everything was excellent! This place will be my new go to Chinese for sure... The servers are really polite here unlike most Chinese restaurants.. Give them a try if you're on the southwest side.."}
{"text":"The crispy fried chicken was so dry. It gets stuck in your throat. Other items are good. Fried rice, jellyfish, veggies."}
{"text":"Finally opened! We had been eyeing this restaurant since their sign was up during spring. Like someone mentioned, the owner also owns the Ohana Hawaiian bbq properties in vegas. 

We came during lunch and were pleased that they had a lunch menu so we ordered a couple items off that. Items ordered:

Hainan chicken garnished with crispy fried shallots, seasoned rice, corn veggie stirfry, cucumber slices with sweet soy and ginger dipping sauces. Lunch portion was good enough for us, even though it doesn't seem much meat on the plate. They included dark and white meat. Chicken was juicy, not dry and quite flavorful! Would have liked the rice to have a little fat in it but that's just a personal preference. I strangely enjoyed snacking on the crispy shallots lol

Two choice bbq combo with roast duck and bbq pork, steamed celery, plum sauce on the side. Roast duck was seasoned just right, not salty at all. Skin was crispy, meat was moist! I didn't have any problem with bone chips like at other restaurants and there was a good amount of meat. One thing that bothered me was that there were still some feathers on the skin and you can definitely notice it when contrasted with the darkness of the skin. I had to pluck them off as best I could as I ate. But some people don't mind that. And OMG the bbq pork was so good! It was actually tender! None of that hard chewy crust that can tire your jaw. I didn't expect much but it blew our mind lol not too much fat or overly greasy either. 

Xiao long bao/ pork soup dumplings arrived steaming hot in those cute like ceramic ladle-like soup spoons. Each dumpling rested on a slice of carrot which I assume is to help it from sticking to the spoon. You can tell they were handmade, but the skins were thick. There was some soup inside but the longer you wait to eat them, the more the dough seemed to suck up the soup especially because of the thickness of the skin. They're served with julienned ginger in black vinegar of course- SO YUM. We still enjoyed them and are glad we tried them. We would probably still order them next time.

Egg drop soup was delicious! Ordered it without veggies. Added a touch of white pepper to it and it was perfect. Tons of flowing, silky egg, consistency was not too thick and seasoned just right. 

Lunch specials do come with rice so we have yet to actually order rice during dinner time. Wish they gave you the option for a small serving of soup rather than family size but I'd gladly take the leftovers and eat them at home!

Price was definitely right for what we got. BF commented that this place is on par with LA's authentic Chinese restaurants when it comes to the quality and taste of the food which he loves.

Btw, Fantastic service at an Asian restaurant, you kind of get thrown off by it lol. The two servers, one female one male, were so attentive throughout the meal. Waters were refilled and not once ever got empty, finished dishes were removed promptly, and he even packed our leftovers to-go personally. Not once did we feel like we were rushed as we ate. They even checked back to make sure everything was okay partway!

We'll be back to try dinner here and the live seafood!"}
{"text":"The menu is too vast to give everything a try before I can conclusively say if the restaurant is decent or not. However, from what we ordered, everything tasted really good and on par with any great restaurants in Chinatown

4 stars for taste; 1 for convenience (for the folks living in the southwest), but minus 1 star for long wait (service was friendly, but the food came out in between loooonnnnggg intervals). 

Also, I've never had black sesame Mochi dumplings with almond milk dessert soup before (usually it's clear broth, and the dumplings are sweet). Oh. My. God. It's so good. The almond milky soup is soooo smooth and creamy. I will come back just for that!"}
{"text":"It's a great place to eat healthy foods! Foods don't have too much salt and oil! It's very delicious!!! The place is very clean and comfortable! Servers are nice and handsome:)"}
{"text":"You would think that a restaurant that names itself \"Taste\" would actually be just that, nooope. Lettuce in my salad was brown and wilty and the rest of the salad was nothing that I couldn't whip up at home with a bottle of dressing from the store. Their \"frites\"  were as if McDonald's attempted a gourmet menu, except worse. AND their \"aioli\" was nothing more than french dressing! Hatehatehatehate."}
{"text":"Exceeded my expectations. First off, the place is so nice. Modernly decorated, clean, very spacious, not crowded to where you bump into each other like many other Chinese restaurants. Dinnerwares are all new and clean. Really like the vibe and atmosphere of the place. 

We ordered a few things to share between the 5 of us: jelly fish and chicken, eggplant, crispy fried fish, veggies with salted and thousand year old egg, and something else which I forgot. Really delicious dishes, we enjoyed everything we ordered. Food came out pretty quickly. They have unique dishes too, we wanted to try the eel but they were out, so I plan on coming back to try that!

Price wise are they a little more expensive than other places, but the quality of the food is there and I would pay for the nice atmosphere. When going out for Chinese I always expected crowded place where they yell the order to the kitchen, loud clanking of dishes and getting bumped by the staff because they just packed the place too tight. This place is so spacious, they space their tables out nicely so you have your own space. 

Definitely recommend this place for a nice family dinner."}
{"text":"Love this place! The menu and pictures look amazing! Only thing is they were out of fresh coconut juice other than that it's almost perfect"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by this place. We were looking for a quick, but tasty, dinner before we headed to the strip to watch the 4:44 Tour. What we got was quick (for the most part, as I'll explain later), tasty, and all-around satisfying. 

The planets must have aligned that evening. For once, my husband knew what he felt like eating. 

Saved from an hour of:

What do you want? 
I don't know. 
Give me something. Anything Pizza? 
No. 
Burgers. 
No. 
Mexican? 
Meh...\" 
on and on ad naseum...

Anyway, he immediately indicated that Chinese food sounded good so I started to search for nearby restaurants and found Taste. 

I decided to give this spot a go due to proximity from home and location away from Chinatown (I didn't feel like battling Spring Mountain traffic before battling strip traffic). 

When we walked in, our party was immediately relieved to find a restaurant full of Chinese/Asian diners. Not just a handful, but entire families making full use of the lazy susans on the larger tables. You could tell they were all enjoying their meals. 

The restaurant itself is almost shockingly clean and bright. The lighting was fantastic for food photos, so I have no complaints here. 

We ordered the roast pork, house special fried rice, salt & pepper calamari, and general tao's chicken. We enjoyed everything. The pork had a beautifully crisp skin, but remained juicy and tender. The salt & pepper calamari had a great crunch and was not lacking in flavor. I especially appreciated the generous serving of jalapenos and garlic. The rice was more on the soy sauce-y side for my preference, but was still great. And the general tao's chicken might be the best I've had, so far. Not long after dinner, we all agreed that we looked forward to chowing down on leftovers after the concert or attempting to go back before they closed at 2AM. Thanks to Jay Z running late, we had to settle for leftovers. 
 
As for service, we did not wait long at all to receive our drinks and place our orders. In fact, we didn't wait long, at all, in general. Food was served quickly, too. Truly, the only fall off in service was toward the end when we needed our check. The planets aligned once again that night as we needed attention at the exact same moment that all of the large families were ready to go. Needing to make our way out, I ended up having to approach the servers' counter near the kitchen to request a box and our bill. 

Price wasn't bad. For 4 dishes and drinks, our bill came out to about $65 before tip. The lunch specials look promising, too. 

I'll need to visit again to solidify my thoughts on this but, for now, it's looking likely that we've found our neighborhood spot!"}
{"text":"Original Chinese Style!
I feel like I am back in China :)
One thing, server misunderstood my order, so got a different dish, but it's okay, the food was great!
Good food, good service even makes me feel better! 
I will definitely go back again. 

Food: Good
Price: Good
Service: Good
Parking: Good"}
{"text":"Amazing. Great atmosphere. Great food. Great alcohol selection. The staff is wonderful, professional and eager to treat you right. The price is a little high but everything good about the place makes it worth it.  And you just feel cool being there. More people should know about this restaurant. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Went for dinner there because they offer some of my favorite dishes. Servers all speak good English and very friendly. But I have to subtract one star because I  ordered two dishes and they forgot one, duh! The red wine beef stew came out pretty quick. The beef was very tender. Couldn't pick it up with chopsticks without falling apart. Too tender. My other dish hadn't show up after I finished the stew, so I told them to pack it to go instead. Free dessert was red bean tapioca soup. It was very good, thick and not too sweet.
They are a little different from from other restaurants that cater to Chinese clientele. They don't have free house soup, and they give you a bowl of rice instead of the huge container. Make more sense to me as it cut down waste. I will go back to try out other favorite dishes."}
{"text":"Wow! They recently opened this place near my brothers house and we had to try it,glad we did! 
When my Cantonese wife is impressed,you know it's good. The portions you get for the price is great,half a roasted duck $15 which was excellent,huge plate of pan fried noodles $10. The service matches the food,both were 5 stars! Will definitely take the drive to eat here again."}
{"text":"Great Service!! Fried rice a little dry with few eggs or veggies. Overall, very clean!"}
{"text":"Nice to have a authentic Chinese restaurant near our home. The atmosphere is bright and clean nice to eat there. Also, they own the Ohana Hawaiian BBQ next door so if I want Chinese and my kids want Hawaiian we are both satisfied! We've ordered quite a bit of dishes from here and loved it all! The only thing is food comes out sporadically..this last time we ate the our rice came out last..I need that with my food!"}
{"text":"We ate at taste the food was very good. We had duck, crispy pork, French filet mignon and honey walnut shrimp. Everything was very good the set was good and we'd come back."}
{"text":"Yay! Another authentic Chinese cuisine in the southwest! The food items are definitely authentic for the taste. But a little bit on the pricey end though. Portion size is smaller than rainbow kitchen as well. They have karaoke rooms for big parties so it's great for your super basic Asian uncles and aunts when they are in town."}
{"text":"This place has amazing food, great happy hour specials and amazing service. We've been there a few times and everything has been consistent. My fiancé and I are both in the restaurant business and have had a really hard time finding restaurants in Cleveland with good service. The first time we went there our server (who was wonderful) forgot to put in our food in so it took a little longer than expected.  She came and told us she forgot to put it in and brought us a complimentary Pom truffle Frits appetizer which were the most delicious French fries I have ever had.  We didn't even notice our food was taking a while because we were having such a great time, but it was very sweet of her to bring us those. This place goes above our expectations. It is definitely a GEM in the Cleveland heights area. It's fine dining on Lee road with a nice great atmosphere. Highly recommend this place! And the creme brulee is incredible! :)"}
{"text":"Our friends brought us here-their favorite Chinese restaurant. We tend to agree: the whole place looks clean(including the restrooms-a big plus), nicely furnished, service pleasant, all the dishes we tried were unique by itself and tasty at very reasonable prices.
Highly recommended!!
Definitely will be back to try their other dishes."}
{"text":"Honey walnut, dry beef chow fun, xiao long bao, sweet and sour pork, spicy eggplant... so good. So good we ordered one more dry beef chow fun.
And I don't have to go to Chinatown. Prices are very good, portions are plentiful. The only down fall is the xiao long bao isn't anywhere near Din Tai Fung quality, flavor and delicateness but hey, also that finer sauce on it and I'm good to go!"}
{"text":"This is the first time we ventured away from the strip and Chinatown to eat Chinese food and we were not disappointed. The atmosphere was welcoming and clean and the food was very authentic and well prepared. The service was also very good compared to other Chinese restaurants. My favorites were the jumbo clam, cold jelly fish and roast pork. My parents enjoyed every dish we ordered. We will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"I'm pescatarian and the FISH balls had pork it. They didn't specify on that it menu that it had pork in it, this is absolutely ridiculous."}
{"text":"I came here because of all the positive reviews but I was highly disappointed. The service here is terrible. We came late at night around 1130pm so they were not busy in any way. They had more than enough staff members to assist.

From the start I already felt they didn't care to serve us. When we came in it took them 5 mins to come seat us. We literally was looking at the waiter when we entered the restaurant but I guess they felt cleaning a single table required a 2 person job. The entire restaurant was empty and 90% of the tables were already cleaned so I have no idea why they wouldn't seat us.

The food delivered was warm and not hot. It felt like it was just reheated. They did not come and check on us. I was without water for at least 15 mins. That felt like eternity. Let me remind you there was only 1 other party in there besides us. They were on the corner organizing menu instead of checking up on guest. I felt rushed by the waiter as if he just wanted me to eat and pay the check. 

There was nothing special about the food. To be honest I felt I should've just walked over to the restaurant next door named Ohana Grill. It would've been half the price and taste the same or better at Ohana Grill.

I probably will only return here if I'm super hungry for Chinese late at night since they open till 2am."}
{"text":"We had family of 14 people  try to celebrate Christmas. Soon as we got there lady was telling us all the table was reserved. She keep insisting us to get private room with minimum $500 food order. What a joke. I was really pissed so, We decide to go to Rainbow kitchen."}
{"text":"Talk about arrogance and self condescending staff. Great as thought they had better people to serve and the smell of fish should have told me not to eat here. Felt nausea after eating here and  will never be back i would advice stay away from here."}
{"text":"Food, the setting and service is amazing!  Highly recommended to those who likes to eat"}
{"text":"FINALLY a authentic chinese restaurant in South Vegas and believe me this place is POPPIN!!
Def Recommend making a RESERVATION. They have about 20-25 tables- ranging from 2-8 people, good for big families
Same owners of Boba Hut and Ohana BBQ- both places have excellent service and quality products. We were probably the least Asian people there and both me and my husband are Asian. Mostly everyone in there was speaking Cantonese. 

Live tank- lobster, crab, talapia, eel where you can pick your own 

Black tea- served really hot and not too bitter and UNLIMITED- perfect palate cleanser for all the amazing food you are able to eat 

WE ordered (see pics)
1) 5 spice marinated beef shank- served cold- spice level 1- served with sliced shallots and cilantro - NOT RECOMMENDED- not a lot of flavor/bland and a lot of fatty pieces with little meat 
2) Egg flower soup- no veggies- VERY BLAND- Not reommended
3) Curry dungeonous crab with buns- THE BEST FREAKING THING EVER!!!!- I AM ALREADY CRAVING this- curry seems coconut milk based with a delicious earth flavor similar to yellow curry. A whole crab is served to you and the shells with the meat and that flavor is to die for!
- you can also get this fried, stir fried, or boiled with many flavors. Def recommend the curry way!
4)Black bean shrimp- normal served with green bell peppers and red onion
5)Schechawan eggplant- NOT SPICY- which was disappointing, and the eggplant was a little bitter- my hubby loved it
6)Side Rice- 1$ for large serving of jasmine rice
7)Dessert-Tapioca red bean soup (Free)- not my cup of tea

Overall the food here is amaZing!! and I will be back esp for that CRAB curry. 
Portions are large and def served family style. A great place for families!"}
{"text":"Arrogant Cleveland Heights cuisine hits a new low with a ridiculously high price for very little food or creativity."}
{"text":"BEWARE!! I sent my soup back because it was cold. And when the server was bringing it back to me, my girlfriend saw the server spit into my soup!!! When I went to the manager, the manager said I was lying!
WOW they they supported their server and not someone who's buying dinner in this new restaurant!!
I will never go here again!! Neither should anyone else!! GROSS!!!!!"}
{"text":"By FAR the best Chinese restaurant without having to drive to spring mountain and even then, this place is clean, staff is nice, I loooove the west lake soup (pic included) ! I've been here 3 times now and I haven't been disappointed.  Salt n pepper Chicken cartilage, minced pork with string beans, juicy pork soup dumpling, roasted pork and bbq pork combo all pictured ! YUM"}
{"text":"Wow!!!  I had previously visited Taste for Happy Hour and vowed to return for dinner.  I did just that, this past Saturday and I am SO glad that I did.  I dined with a girlfriend.  I ordered from the Prix Fixe menu $55 for 2 glasses of wine, appetizer, entree and dessert.  I ordered Riesling, as my wine option and it was very good!  I ordered the mussels, which were excellent, tender and smothered in sauteed onions & tomatoes, in a luscious lemon butter, garlicky broth.  For my entree, I ordered one of the specials of the day, crab stuffed salmon fillet, with yellow rice and seasonal vegetable drizzled in lemon butter.  OMG, the portion was more than generous and oh so tasty!   For dessert, I ordered the white chocolate vanilla creme brulee and I enjoyed every bit of it.  My girlfriend ordered a la carte.  The chicken & chorizo pizza and chocolate mousse, topped with hazelnut ice cream, which she raved about.  Our server was awesone! I will absolutely return to Taste, sooner rather than later!"}
{"text":"For those seeking a traditional Chinese dinner this place is for you.  The food is amazing, and authentic for sure."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place out to see if it would be any different than the regular Chinese places in Chinatown. Big place, very spacious, not cramped at all (similar to LA Chinese restaurants). Came here for lunch, ordered the items off their special menu. Portion arent too bad but could be bigger, taste is good. They definitely put in some work in making each dish taste good! 

They have a large selection of seafood if thats what youre looking for. Next time going to try their other dishes!

Check it out!"}
{"text":"Horrible customer service. Bartender was rude to the point that instead of bringing my entire party inside for a night of celebration we left immediately. Would not recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"What a place. Did not expect it to be so good.
Soup of the day, cream of mushrooms MUST be put on the menu.
Calamari were very good.
Gnocchi excellent and lamb also very \"tasty\".
Cheesecake was simply perfect. Service was fast. We will definitely be back.

We went back. Same excellent experience. 
Service again was very good. Food was very delicious. My wife has Gnocchi again and I had duck 
We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"First time trying this restaurant and I'm very impressed how clean and bright the place is. The taste is spectacular,, every dish we ordered has a very good flavor."}
{"text":"The food was OK, but service was disappointingly bad when entertaining a group of 12 on a Friday. We ordered 11 dishes 10 days before the dinner. Later we added Xiaolongbao, roast pork and Black Fungus with Japanese Yam for those who don't eat duck. The food was served late. We had to assembled the Peking duck parts ourselves (the crispy skin, the veggie) even though we did asked for it to be presented inside the bun, ready to eat. Worst, the soup from the duck was presented in 3 oz cups. The ugly bones, tofu chunks and 2\" mustard pieces were presented on a separate plate! We have never experienced such a  disgraceful way of presenting this elegant dish! Chinese dinner usually ends with a carbo dish, rice or noodle. Even though we told Taste to serve the noodle dish at end of the dinner, it served the noodle right at the beginning of the dinner! Two fried flounder were ordered. They came stacked on top of each other, worst than if we had gone to 99 Ranch supermarket and ordered fried fish to take home.
The karaoke equipment didn't work either. The microphone blasts ear deafening sound. We ran out several times from the private room to the frontdesk near the kitchen to ask for help. But there was nobody at that frontdesk. All waiters were serving food or taking orders. We had to grab just any walk-by waiter to ask for help whether for the karaoke equipment, to clean up the table or for the dessert. No, it was not a memorable dinner. Just a group meal with a bad, impersonal, chaotic service."}
{"text":"OMG!!! This place is just amazing! I had my high school friends there with them in June and it was just spectacular! We selected a day several months in advance with no defined plans, just the date. It just so happened that the same day was their Wine and Burger tasting...eeeek!

Our party of a mere 25 was moved to the front patio on a sunny day, but rainy night. Who cared! We had a wonderful time as the rain droplets dripped, but who cared. Larry and Raj (the owners) surprised us with special pricing the entire night! Sandy. Robin, Matt and Marc held our party down and we had a BLAST!!!

Their food is incredible, drinks are amazing and service is just spectacular! Oooooooo, did I say incredible, amazing and spectacular? Oh, sorry, redundant.  Go see for yourself and don't miss Happy Hour...one of the 216 favorites!

Oh, by the way...the purest, smoothest, tastiest, \"bestest\" creme brûlée in the 216, 330 or 440! I'm jus sayin!!!"}
{"text":"Taste has quickly become one of my favorite restaurants in the Heights area.  We've been a few times now, both as a date night and with parents visiting from out of town, and we've had a great experience with each visit.

The interior is modern and pretty without being pretentious or stuffy.  It's also pretty quiet, which is a major plus since crowd noise is a dealbreaker for a few of our family members.  Service has been excellent every time, and we've never had a bad meal.  I'm very partial to the pappardelle with its delicious sausage and mushroom red sauce.  I finally branched out to the chicken saltimbocca last time, and it was delicious as well.  Other items that have gotten positive reviews at our table have included the filet napoleon (apparently the potato pancake is especially tasty), calamari appetizer, beet salad, red snapper, and various specials.

It's not exactly a cheap night out, but prices are low considering the quality; my favorite item is $21 for a very generous portion of pasta, and the most expensive item on the menu is $32.  The wine list is good, and they have a good selection of mixed drinks as well.  They take reservations and are currently on Reso.  There is a metered parking lot around the corner (change only, no cards), as well as harder-to-find street parking.

Definitely recommended for a nice night out in one of suburbia's trendier neighborhoods."}
{"text":"overpriced and rude! this guys messed our order and when we called them to see if they could correct it, they didnt ggive a fuck and acted rude and didnt even bother to correct their mistake! you seriously just lost loyal customers, beware of this place, they aren't honest..."}
{"text":"This is definitely the new choice for Chinese food.  New, clean, and good service.   Cando style is comparable to Vancouver's many Cantonese restaurants.   This would be our choice for neighborhood restaurant.   For those that are not Strip or Chinatown foodie crowd, this is the spot in the upcoming Asian food central on south Rainbow.  Price is above average.   Seafood is on the high side.  I would wait to get on a trip to RIchmond, B.C. to taste the magnificent seafood menu there.  The menu here caters to the different Chinese styles. This variety gives one the urge to pick and choose the style that you may crave at the moment, without driving to different types of restaurants.   This place also has 2 private rooms for special functions and gathering, providing privacy to the patrons.  Will be back to taste the rest of the items on the menu.  
Note:  Chef -  please add more rice to the congee,  too watery."}
{"text":"Taste is one of many a restaurant and bar along hip Lee Rd. It looked ornery from the outside, but the interior was both elegant and modern. I'd recommend the shrimp appetizer. The Chicken Saltimboca entree was a hefty and satisfying portion. The tender chicken wrapped in Proscuitto and melted provolone was served hot, and very delicious. The salmon was equally impressive. I would've ordered alcohol, if not for post-dinner plans to grab few more drinks at the wine shop down the road, but hey, don't let this stop you.

I can see myself coming back. Admittedly, I had more than a \"taste,\" I was stuffed, but the former sounds like a better name for a restaurant though. 4 stars."}
{"text":"We ordered the lunch special, Beef stew egg noodle soup $7.50 and the roast duck with rice and bok choy. The beef stew $10 was tender and delicious with plenty of meat and noodles. The roast duck was juicy and the sweet sauce that came with it was delicious. The place was also nicely decorated and clean. The staff was friendly."}
{"text":"We came to Taste for a \"double date\" night with friends. Love the hip vibe and atmosphere. Service for the jam-packed restaurant (Restaurant Week) was slow but friendly, knowledgeable and helpful. Though it took a while until we managed to order our dinners, we were smart enough to order an appetizer (pomme frites) to munch on as we sipped our red wine and martinis.

Overall, the dinner was very good. Roasted Chicken breast with asiago pine nut crust and Chardonnay cream sauce was very testy. Green beans were blanched, so they had crunch. Roasted red and golden beet salad was good, but this side dish had more than enough to share with a friend.

Hubster enjoyed his pappardelle, down to the very last spoonful.

Portions were fair, food quality fresh and tasty, and the wine selection was very generous."}
{"text":"We ordered off the happy hour menu after coming out from a play across the street.  Happy hour is available daily at the bar and at the high tops.  Appetizers are almost half price, and there are some good drink specials.

We started off with a drink, which was delicious and by far my favorite part of the meal.  We ordered a bunch of apps to share, which included the grilled shrimp piccata, stuffed peppers, mussels, and fried calamari.  I was most excited to try the shrimp piccata that I had read about.  However, I had 2 issues with it. 

The waiter forgot my instruction to have the sauce on the side for the shrimp, which made it difficult for me to eat since I am avoiding butter for health reasons.  I did manage to cut a piece that didn't have any sauce on it to try, but it was still disappointing; it was described on the menu as being grilled but it was more heavily coated and basically deep fried and super greasy.  The mussels were done well, but we had a bunch that were definitely not fresh.  The stuffed peppers were pretty standard, and the calamari was done pretty nicely with a much lighter coating than the shrimp and not as greasy.

I might return if I were in the area, but I certainly wouldn't go out of my way to go.  Plus there are a ton of other places to try on the very same street!"}
{"text":"Amazing amazing amazing. We got the eel, fried whole lobster, sweet and sour fish, and shrimp lo mein. I'm not even a huge seafood person but it was so good even as leftovers heated in the oven. Can't wait to try other things."}
{"text":"To celebrate my mom's birthday, I wanted to take her to a restaurant that was sophisticated yet still close to the Cedar-Lee neighborhood so that we can go the Dobama Theatre afterwards. As far as the outside of the restaurant goes, it does blend in with the block it occupies so it can be very easy to walk or drive past it. However, once you walk in, you realize immediately that you have come to the right place. The atmosphere is modern and relaxing and the food is excellent! We both ordered the Crab Stuffed Salmon with wild mushroom risotto, roasted vegetables. We did order ours without the crab meat and substituted the roasted vegetables for asparagus and it was perfect!   The food was cooked to perfection and we finished just in time to walk over to the theatre."}
{"text":"Since my aunt and uncle are in town and they stayed around the corner, they invited me and my family to come eat here. First off, we made a reservation of 14 people at 8 p.m. and my uncle and aunt came first before us. 

Me and my family came around 8:10 p.m. and we looked at their menu. Their menu looked very nice but they didn't have much portions as my other favorite chinese restaurant in Las Vegas. We had two tables but two separate orders on the same check. 

We ordered several dishes they are:
- Salt and Pepper Pork Chop
- Orange Chicken
- Peking Duck
- Salty Fish and Chicken Fried Rice
- Honey Walnut Shrimp
- House Special Pan Fried Noodles

The food overall was alright. I was as little disappointed that some of the food were not crispy enough as I expected. But I was happy the food didn't have tons of fat. Very satisfied overall. I recommend to try this place if you decide to try something new."}
{"text":"Must try the lamb with scallion and the jellyfish and chicken appetizer
The service staff exceeded expectations all the wait staff was knowledgeable about the dishes and they were very attentive
The restaurant was clean and well run"}
{"text":"This place is pretty good! The staff has been very friendly and fairly speedy the two times I have been here.

Seasonal specials are usually a good choice."}
{"text":"So AMAZING. Took my friend here for her birthday during restaurant week and it was delicious. 3 course meal for $33, no additional coupons. 

We both ordered a glass of wine: pinot noir which was extremely acidic, and pinot grigio which my friend loved. 

Appetizers: The most amazing mussels, actually it's the sauce that made them amazing the mussels were fairly flavorless. That sauce, though. we wanted to drink it! Appetizer two was the arancini balls, delicious, cheesey, heavy and filling. I think there was pesto in them? So good!

Main course: I ordered the roasted duck, with mashed potatoes, mushrooms, shallots. and carrots, in a wine sauce. The duck was perfectly tender, the sauce beautifully seasoned, and the creamiest mashed potatoes I've ever had. My friend ordered the crab stuffed salmon. The salmon was a tiny big dry hut the crab was great. It came with the most amazing mushatom risotto.

Dessert: The best creme brulee I've ever tasted, and a lemon cheesecake. Both very good, but I would go back just got the creme brulee and I didn't even think I liked the stuff yo begin with.

It's beautiful inside. The staff was very nice. It started to get busy around 6-"}
{"text":"It has such a good environment. It is definitely well liked because every time I go they have a bunch of people there. The waiters are very nice and the food comes out fast. I had my Chinese friend order for me since he had been to that place a lot but it was one of the better Chinese places I have been to."}
{"text":"I love duck and it's hard to find restaurants that have it.  So I went to Taste cuz they have several duck choices.  The Peking duck was more than twice the price of the roast duck.  So I got 1/2 a roast duck cuz I'm cheap like that.  It came suspiciously quickly.  It was beautifully seasoned and cooked.  But not hot, just warm.  Duck takes time to eat so by the time I got 1/2 way done it was cold.  I don't like cold duck but I ate it (cuz I'm cheap like that).  It was super clean, the staff was nice but hard to communicate with.  Filled with Asian people. Great prices.  If I lived in Vegas, I'd go back."}
{"text":"We have been eating here ever since we found this place. Delicious Chinese food! Nearby my house and way better than the food in Chinatown. Employees are nice and friendly. Very clean restaurant. Bathrooms are very clean and smells good. It's a big plus in my book especially if the bathrooms are clean!"}
{"text":"The bathroom is the cleanest I have ever seen in any Chinese establishment. Overall very clean. Food is very fresh and quality is high. Will be back"}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time. They weren't very busy and server seated us right away. We ordered the lobster harbor style ($63) 2 meat combo of duck and roast pork, Hong Kong pan fried noodles and the bf wanted Mongolian beef. Food came out quick and server were nice and attentive. Restaurant was also very clean, would definitely return!"}
{"text":"This new Chinese/Cantonese restaurant just opened and there's a lot of dishes on the menu that want to try. Like the duck and the squab (which they were out of) but I'll try it next time. I love Curry Crab with steamed buns & the Harbor (spicy) Lobster!"}
{"text":"My husband and I love trying out new Chinese restaurants out in the southwest in hopes of being able to avoid Chinatown. And we may have just found that place!  They have all our favorites!  Fried potstickers, green onion pancakes, wonton noodle soup and beef noodle soup!  The food was flavorful and light.  The potstickers and green onion pancakes especially!  The soups were just he right amount and they were very generous with the meat.

The place is new, fresh and clean.

The staff was friendly and quick.  They didn't hover over us while we were eating.

They have an extensive menu that we definitely be back for to try more food!"}
{"text":"Have you been to Taste? Have you even heard of it? 

You should look it up, because it is just delish!

This little restaurant on Lee Road may be in sort of an awkward location, but as soon as you walk inside you'll feast your eyes upon this swanky, modern spot. 

As you sit down, you'll notice an pretty incredible wine and champagne list to go along with the upscale vibe surrounding you. I love me some Vueve, but I was impressed with the menu of choices that extended well beyond what I've ever heard of. What's even better is the variety of price range. 

I came here with my beau before a show at Cleveland Play House and, of course, true to our form we were running late. As we bustled into Taste, we were seated right away and we told them our predicament. Normally this would worry me, but we were taken care of with impeccable attention to detail and swift service without that \"rushed\" feeling. 

Our meals were fantastic too! Steak and tuna cooked perfectly with unique accompaniments that brought out the right flavors in the meat. Drinks were always full and everything was put together in a timely manner, including our check. We were in and out and even left on time for our show!

Bravo to Taste for great service and tasty, imaginative food! I don't nearly get to dine here enough, but when I go, it's certainly a treat. A perfect, date night idea too! 

P.S. Parking can be a pain on Lee Rd. There is complimentary Taste parking around back. Just call for details!"}
{"text":"Exceptional food, great service . I had the french style filet mignon, which is the best."}
{"text":"I cam for lunch to search for good char siu BBQ pork.  I had the lunch platter which came with a choice of 2 (BBQ pork, roast pork, roast duck), a few big clumps of bok choy, and some rice.  This came to about $10.  The portion size was actually pretty solid with about 8 pieces of each meat.  The duck was very well cooked and flavored.  The char siu was a little sweeter than I was hoping but still good.  Overall, a nice lunch spot at a good price.  The restaurant looks like it's catering to a more upscale environment but the prices are lower than you'd expect from the interior.  Hopefully people can find Taste in the area that is already heavy on good Asian food, more leaning towards the Japanese and Korean variety.  But in all a tasty and affordable lunch if you're in the area and want to change it up a bit from the typical salad and sandwiches."}
{"text":"Went here for restaurant week. There is a parking lot on the side so you don't have to pay a meter which is nice. The service is not so nice... I walked in the front door and the bartender just stared at me then continued to play with some wine bottles in a mini fridge. A waitress looked at me and walked right on past to to say hi to the bartender then walked away. Um hello, greet your patrons! I had made a reservation but had to search through the crowd and find my table on my own. Even after being seated the service seemed to take a while even though the place was not even 1/3 full. 

The food...
*Bread and olive oil with balsamic vinegar: nothing special. 
*Panko-Crusted Lump Crab with Chardonnay Cream, Roasted Corn: This came out luke warm and we tasted more fried panko crust than crab meat. 
*Roasted Chicken Breast with Asiago-Pine Nut Crust, Chardonnay Cream Sauce, Ham-Corn-Bacon Risotto: I thought the chicken was cooked perfectly with a crispy crust and juicy meat. Loved the sauce with it as well. The risotto was a bit hard and the green beans that were served were almost raw. 
*Crab-Stuffed Salmon with Lemon Cream Sauce, Pesto Risotto, Grilled Asparagus: The asparagus was the best part of this dish. The rest was boring and a better version could be made at home. 
*White Chocolate and Vanilla Crème Brûlée: Break through the sugar crust that tasted like propane to find flakes of vanilla settled at the bottom of cold custard. I ate it, but I've definitely had better from the frozen food's section at Target. 

Overall? Meh."}
{"text":"This is probably the best authentic Chinese restaurant in town, even comparing the ones in the casinos. Awesome food selection and flavor. Got to try it out. You owe it to yourself."}
{"text":"I loved everything about this restaurant! My boyfriend and I went for date night & a mini celebration and it was the perfect place for what I was looking for. Very cute, trendy, & had an intimate ambiance but not to stuffy. The food was fantastic & they had great portions! They also had very good drinks! We will definitely be back soon :)"}
{"text":"It's a tasty place. I wouldn't say it's the best French America but it's tasty. I feel the prices are a bit high for the quality of the food. But if you go for their Monday and Tuesday night specials : An appetizer or salad, a choice of entree with the exception of the strip steak adding ($5), and a desert for $29. A pretty awesome deal.

I've had their scallops, calamari (they are cooked not fried), duck breast and trio ice cream. They were all pretty good. I have to say the duck breast was pretty yummy but it came with a plain presentation - just a side mash potato.

The portions are also pretty small, so expect yourself to order a 3 course."}
{"text":"Unfortunately the restaurant that I wanted to dine at for my birthday night was so busy that I was unable to grab a reservation. Maybe that is okay, though! After finding taste, on Yelp, we decided this might be a good place to go. We called and left a message about our reservation and when they opened we received a call back to confirm.

I think that everyone at the table ordered the same; the Prix-Fixe: $49 for 2 glasses of wine, an Appetizer, an Entree and a dessert. However, certain restrictions do apply.

Everything that I tasted was very good!

Wine: It seemed like you can only purchase most by the bottle. However, they have at least one of each type of wine by the glass. (I had one glass of Pino Noir and one glass of Cabernet Sauvignon. Both were delicious.)

Appetizer: Lump Crab: very good!

Entree: Shrimp Scampi

Dessert: Chocolate Mousse and Vanilla Ice Cream

The service was great. Our waiter was attentive and personable."}
{"text":"Always makes me laugh when I see a review call a restaurant authentic/non-authentic Chinese food. This place's chef, like any other chef, has his own interpretation of what some very classic Chinese Food dishes are supposed to be. Where there are historical immigrant Chinese populations, the style of food has evolved and been adapted to local tastes and ingredients, and modified by the local cuisine, to greater or lesser extents. So if you think you know \"Authentic Chinese Food\" and want it? Get on a flight to Hong Kong as soon as you can, and report back.

When I think of Chinese gastronomes I rate it primarily of the focus or lack of extracting the maximum flavor of each ingredient in the dish I ordered.  I ordered the four dishes the server told me were the House Specialties. The Walnut Shrimp stood out. Every flavor of the ingredients used stood out and I enjoyed. Even the traditional bed of shredded Chinese cabbage complemented the dish nicely.

Next up was a dish of Fried Rice. The rice was delicate and not over cooked. The other ingredients added were all fresh and complemented the dish. They didn't drown the dish in soy sauce like you normally see here in Vegas.

I ordered one of their jellyfish dishes and enjoyed it very much. The fourth and last dish was the Chinese stew which was excellent as well. These last two dishes you normally don't see on menus and you should stay away from if your taste buds are thoroughly Mericanized'.

Hasn't been open very long and found the staff pleasant and courteous. Nothing bugs me more than a server that over compensates by bugging you every five minutes. Looked up once when I needed another drink and the server recognized immediately I was in need of something.

Didn't do desert because, as usual I over ordered, and didn't leave any room for it.

This place is not to be confused with the likes of Hakkasan, Wing Lei,  Jasmine or Mr, Chow. You won't see their décor, ambiance, or their prices at Taste.

Looking for a place that aspires to be nothing more than a above average neighborhood Chinese Food restaurant? Try this place. The Chef here will not let you down. And yes, I was the only non-Chinese person eating there."}
{"text":"I recently decided to finally patronize this restaurant and I must say that I was pleasantly surprised at the warm ambience upon entrance to this unassuming gem of a place. I was immediately greeted by the lovely Leah, who in turn, invited me in out of the cold. With her beautiful disposition, I knew all at once, I was destined for a good time. I told her that I was \"a virgin\" to this establishment and she took an equal excitement to my news and refreshingly educated me on their affordable happy hour cocktail specials ($6) and their tasty appetizers ($7). She recommended the vodka cosmo, a great choice and it was equally inviting and delicious! I then ordered the calamari as an appetizer and later on, chose the roasted chicken breast (tender and succulent), with this interesting cheesy rice (had mixed veggies in it too) and crispy string beans. Everything was delicious! Needless to say, I was highly satisfied with my visit and will be returning and as soon as I can. Great cocktails, great food and great service! Kudos! Get there! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I would call this Tasteless on a Bad Friday. We had been here numerous times with no problems, tonight very different. We ordered calamari for an appetizer it was cold and tasteless. I had to ask our waiter for bread. This should not happen. About 5 minutes after the calamari came, the main entrees came. 3 people were sharing the appetizer and still a lot on the plate and the main course comes?  My daughter's eggplant 0 taste. My gnocchi 0 taste with me putting extra Parmesan on it. I expressed my disappointment to the waiter and he stated the manager would come talk to us. Nope just an offer for a free $5 dessert for me.  I'm diabetic and am allowed 1 meal a week where I don't have to watch my carbs. This was it and a waste of my splurge meal. They get a 1 because I can't give a 0"}
{"text":"I live a few blocks from this restaurant and finally made my first visit.  It has a cozy, wine bar vibe.  There is a prix fix menu that allows you to chose three courses and two glasses of wine.  The wine selection is nice, with a good selection of foreign and domestic choices.  The appetizers were pretty non-descript.  The salads - beet salad and caesars salad - we had were fresh and flavorful.  The filet mignon was simply amazing. The veal osso buco seemed uninspired.  The dessert menu was good as well, especially the home made sherberts.  The big turn off was the service.  It was very obvious that repeat customers were getting great service and we were not.  Our waiter did not tell us about any of the specials, but told the two tables around us about them.  We were not checked up on, while others were being coddled.  So in all, food was okay, wine was good, service ruined the experience.  Will not be coming back anytime soon."}
{"text":"We were pleasantly supprised with an extensive menu, authentic cusine, and ecletic decor. Probably, the best Hong Kong-pan fried noodles anywhere."}
{"text":"Good happy hour. Tasty , original dishes, well prepared and well presented. Good friendly service. In an IPA world, the beer list lacks one. We tried the lamb meatballs, the spicy shrimp, and the pizza du jour, all very good, pizza was the star. We will be back."}
{"text":"This place has great food and gorgeous decor. I recommend it for when you have a large group. The staff is nice and attentive. The price is just a bit more than other Chinese restaurants, but it's worth it considering the ambience, quality of food, and service. It's pretty and nice in here. Everything I've had has been tasty (ha! Taste-y). I've never had a bad experience here and I would recommend it to people craving good food and a good time."}
{"text":"Location: really easy to find. Didn't realize that \"taste\" was the name of the restaurant. Quick parking. 

Environment: very nice and elegant. Nothing too flashy. Very bright and modern looking. 

Service: professional. Not too over bearing. Food came on time and fresh. 

Food: ordered chillian sea bass hot pot, which is one of my favorites. Peppered beef. Tofu hot pot and jellyfish. Every dish was great. I haven't had Chinese food in a while and surprisingly it was good. Everything goes well with rice. To end the meal they served us sweet hot taro. 

Overall: I had a good experience. It's been awhile since I had a good Chinese food. A \"must go\""}
{"text":"Pretty much the best Chinese food you can get.  Not only is the price very affordable, the flavor and freshness is AMAZING!  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"So at this point I typically only write a review if a place is either really good or really not. Unfortunately this was the later. Four of us each had a different entrée and each one had its own problem. Overcooked fish, cold pasta, crab stuffed salmon with no stuffing, pasta not prepared as ordered. We have certainly been here enough times to know that Taste is not always like this. However tonight was REALLY not their night. Service has never been their strength and tonight was no different. While pleasant enough, our server was not very helpful nor present. If I am going to drop $100+/couple at least one of us should enjoy some part of our meal. Not saying that we won't ever be back but it will certainly be a while before it happens again. Too bad."}
{"text":"No need to go to China Town. This place is just aa good as the best ones in Spring Mountain. We will definitely go back for more."}
{"text":"Was so excited to try this place out based on the reviews. Disappointed. First of all the tea pot and utensils weren't washed and filthy. Then my food came out and thought it was just ok. I had the crispy fried chicken, soup dumplings & cake noodle. Maybe I ordered the wrong thing but not sure I'll be back."}
{"text":"First off beautiful restaurant from top to bottom. The facility is always clean. The staff is fantastic, great service and very accommodating. And of course the food is what's most important when going to a restaurant. I love the variety and the prices are very fair, very rarely have I had complaints about the quality of their food. I love taste"}
{"text":"You know how you know you're at a good Chinese restaurant? You look around and only see Chinese people. We got some stuff we loved and some things we can do without. 

Xialong bao: definitely the best thing we had. I'm a huge XLB fan. They serve it to you in individual spoons, which is useful. If you've never had this definitely add the ginger and put some sauce they add it in.

Honey spareribs: Didn't really taste like spareribs. I'm honestly not sure what meat it was. This was okay, not the best thing. It had an interesting taste. If you order this, definitely get something else also, it was on the sweeter side. 

Salt and pepper fish: This dish needed more salt and pepper to be honest. It didn't have a lot of flavor. The only parts that had flavor was the parts that jalapeños on them.

This place is a solid option for Chinese restaurant. The prices range from pretty affordable to the more expensive side. They do have a lot of seafood options. I'll definitely be back if I have a craving."}
{"text":"I was a little intimidated by the fancy decor that the food prices would be outrageous. But the prices are reasonable, especially their lunch specials from 11-3. 

But I went for dinner so let me refocus. 
I honestly wouldn't doubt if everything on their menu is delicious but I had the general Tao's chicken and the salt and pepper shrimp. 
It was a great serving size for the price and it was deliciously made. 

Do I wish the salt and pepper shrimp still had the head? Yes
Do I wish the chicken was a bit chrispier? 
Yes. 

Did I love every bite of it? Yaaaaasssss. 

Their service was very prompt and they were very friendly and attentive. The ambiance of the restaurant was great and I see myself coming back for more and more deliciousness. 
#LoveMeSomeChineseFood"}
{"text":"We had a great time at Taste. I had the linguine aioli with shrimp- it was amazing! Some of the best shrimp I have ever had. Enjoyed a glass of wine, also very good. They are a bit pricey, but I would think most people would know that going in. We used a restaurant.com gift certificate and had no issues. That saved us some money too. I had read a few reviews that they had slow service, which I was worried about because we were on our way to Playhouse Square for a show, but the food came quickly and I didn't even have to say anything. Friendly waiter. Happy hour is right at dinner time, I'd definitely go back."}
{"text":"Love the little extra attention they pay to guests here.  Small things like recommendations, knowledge of the wines and menus, and free tastings keep us coming back again and again.  A personal favorite!"}
{"text":"I went here because the pictures looked so good but we really weren't impressed with any of the dishes we ordered. Very generic tasting"}
{"text":"Found this restaurant on yelp. Had some extra time before our flight. Highly satisfied with our decision to come here. I give them 4 1/2 out of 5. 

Ordered roast duck and pork, wonton noodle soup, walnut shrimp (deliciousness), French filet mignon (super tasty too). It was all very yummy I don't eat duck, but my husband does and said it was good. Would order everything again. 

If your looking for a good Chinese restaurant try this place. Also, if you are at all adventurous try this place. They have live crab, lobster, eel and tilapia! 

The only thing I can say that was a little issue is they brought the food too quickly. So it all came out together. We had to ask them to hold off on the beef for just a couple minutes. That's the only reason for 4 stars not 5!"}
{"text":"This might just be my favorite date night restaurant.  The ambiance is perfect for quiet conversation with a loved one.  The service is friendly and knowledgeable.  The food is delectable. I enjoyed a wine that was recommended and it was a perfect pairing.  There is absolutely nothing i would change about this place."}
{"text":"Highly recommended Chinese food in the SW area.  Pretty good service as well.  Get the garlic greens and eggplant dish.  Clean and new"}
{"text":"Customer service like shit. First day we went, waited 45 mins for food. They gave some lame ass excuse. Today we went back with 2 tables in the whole entire place. Still waited 30 mins for food. The waitor gave the dish to another table (their friend) and told us our order wasn't put in. Then we asked the original person who took the order, she said if was put into the system. 2 waitor bullshiting customers. Go eat somewhere else that appreciates their customer."}
{"text":"Arrived and parked around the back for free parking. Meters on the street side. We came here to have dinner the evening before the Cleveland Rock and Roll 1/2 marathon. We wanted a good meal, but not to over eat. Worked out great! My wife had the PRIX-FIXE menu for which she chose the Caesar salad and the Seafood Paella ($5 extra). The salad was delicious. However, the paella was outstanding! Lots of seafood and broth. The only complaint was there should have been more rice in the dish. Had to finish the broth with a spoon instead of eating it with more rice. We mentioned that to the server. I hope they add more in the future. I had the Roasted Duck Breast. They didn't even ask how to cook it, but brought it out perfectly cooked, rare. So tender and juicy. I substituted the grilled asparagus with Scallion Potato Pancakes (sorry Mom). Such a great meal! Not too much either. For dessert we shares my wife's Chocolate Mousse with Hazelnut Ice Cream. Also very good, made here. Recommended."}
{"text":"Tonight was my second time going to Taste in 10 days. The meal was great, but after receiving the bill I discovered that a split fee was added to the bill. It was listed on the menu, and the previous visit 
We also shared an entree but no fee was added. 
I asked that the fee be removed as the prices I don't feel warrant this kind of petty add on. But was told it was on the menu and that there was labor involved to split the entree. It is something I would not expect at this kind of higher end restaurant. I thought as a good faith gesture removing the fee this time, since I did not see it on the menu would have been a good way of resolving the issue but.....
At the end of the conversation I was told that this was not MacDonald's and I did need to come back. 
So I won't and I'll be telling everyone I know about this, and will not go to the owners other restaurant 
Cafe Tandoor in Cleveland Hts. Too bad !"}
{"text":"I'm told that the fried Brie served to me is actually the \"baked\" Brie I ordered off the menu because, apparently, in this establishment \"baked Brie\" is a \"type of Brie\" and not actually a style of baking/cooking. Hmm...,, not worth the $ for Brie that tastes like fried mozzarella."}
{"text":"I thought I was really good! Food was super fresh and the atmosphere was pretty cool. They have 2 large party rooms in the back which, are really cool. Something to keep in mind at a later date for large groups. Staff was amazing and very helpful with dish selections. They must have some sort of partnership with Ohana because, the milk teas are the ones sold at Ohana. Super good and will be returning again. Keep it up taste crew!"}
{"text":"Amazing amazing amazing food!!!! Blown away with the stuffed eggplant and the Brie. Every one was extremely satisfied with their meal. Amazing. 
However, our server was just shy of awful. I couldn't even tell you his name because I'm pretty sure he didn't even say."}
{"text":"I ordered dinner from this place and the food was quite good! I tried lamb with cumin, orange chicken, and chao fan! I highly recommend try out their orange chicken!!! I think it was the best I have ever had. I will be ordering from this place again for sure!!!"}
{"text":"We found this place one Saturday afternoon while looking for somewhere to eat. When we got to the door, there were workers going in and out. We thought they weren't open and we were about to leave. The hostess who greeted us was really nice. The food was great. It was the best family style restaurant that we've ever been to. The whole restaurant looked fancy. We've been there 3 times since they've opened. You won't be disappointed.  The staff members were all awesome. Love this place so far!!!"}
{"text":"Came here twice during the week and like the service so far, but the 3rd time I came during the weekend the service got pretty bad...I found out they sell shark fin soup there, so I questioned them about it and they made it sound like it's not a big deal at all to be cruel to eat shark fin and told me I don't have to order it if I don't want to(in pretty rude tone).  Of course I'm not ordering it since they acted so mean.  That does it for me, I WILL NOT support any restaurant who do business with those monsters who will catch shark, slice off all their fins and throw them back into ocean to suffer and die.

{"text":"I highly recommend this place if you want really good authentic Chinese food! Even all the waiters were Chinese. Got the Wonton noodle soup and it was probably the best I've had here in vegas. Gyoza was just cooked perfectly and taste exactly what what I was expecting! And of course we ordered 2 XLB, and OMG it was mouthwatering. It was soupy and I've tried 3 places around town and they weren't as soupy as this one! Y'all need to come here STAT!!!"}
{"text":"Took over an hour to receive the food my family and I ordered. The 4 tables that sat down after us received their food before us. Restaurant was not packed. Will think twice about coming back."}
{"text":"The long awaited Taste Chinese Cuisine has finally opened!!!!!! The family runs a vast array of restaurants from Ohana Hawaiian BBQ to boba houses, so you know they mean business.  This restaurant's concept includes entertainment with fine dining.  

There are a number of dining rooms for private parties and the main lounge can accommodate over hundreds of guest. You can also tour the seafood tanks while you are at it. 

The Chinese food offering has your traditional favorites like deep fried squab, Szechuan eggplant, cold ginger chicken and much more.  At the same time, the chef is very innovative and adventurous with creating new favorites like Thai curry crab and lobsters, lettuce wraps and hot pots.  

This is a must try for residents and tourist alike."}
{"text":"Went here for New Year's Eve dinner.  We were a little hesitant given some of the negative reviews.  We were very pleased.  The food was terrific as was the service.  The beer and wine lists are impressive.  We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The slowest restaurant I have ever visited. It took one hour twenty minutes before our food was served."}
{"text":"What a cool place and concept. I recommend coming with at least three people but I think 4-5 people is perfect. The dishes are pretty big and if you have a larger group you can order more and try more items. We had the Chinese broccoli, chopped duck with buns (the smallest order of duck they had), walnut shrimp and dumplings. All of it was great. Dessert that Night was red bean with tapioca. You do not have to order the desert it automatically comes at the end. It was pretty interesting and literally tasted like a warm bowl of red beans. I was told it's a traditional Chinese dessert dish so I totally respect that. I wish they had more dessert options. I'm giving four stars because I had to flag somebody down to greet our table after 10 minutes of getting seated. Once we got the order taken everything was fine after."}
{"text":"Food was great but it took quite a while to hit the table. Not sure if it was something we specifically ordered, but other tables came after but had their food before us. 
Garlic eggplant was on point. We were warned it would be spicy, but as long as you avoid the small chili peppers, you'd be fine!
The sizzling plates were a new concept for us with Chinese. Great decision on our point. We got pepper beef and it was absolutely delicious!  Meat was very tender and flavorful. I just wish it wasn't the first item to hit the table, if would have been nice to enjoy it a little hotter. 
We ordered lomein, which was a lovely bonus to see on the menu. You don't see it quite often in Vegas. Again, flavors were on point! And the fresh vegetables were crisp!  
The wonton soup, which I think took the longest, was okay. It was a little too fishy for me. My kids wouldn't even eat it. 
Overall we were satisfied with our meal. I will say we \"tasted\" and may not make a special trip to go back. Worth the try though!"}
{"text":"We live very close by, kind of excited there is another choice of restaurant in our area. Inside is clean, servers are very attentive. We ordered live shrimp, pancake, lettuce chicken wrap, tofu, roast duck and steam pork with salty fish. I was surprised they charged $1 per rice bowl and no free soup. Would have given them 5 star if they did give free rice, not that I'm a rice eater, it is the principal. 
Food in general is good, I won't say it is the best... but in this area, it is not a bad choice. Oh, be expect the price is a little higher than Chinese Restaurant around Spring Mountain."}
{"text":"We came on Sunday night.  There were numerous tables, but service was excellent.  Also food came out quick.  One dish (roast pork) was lukewarm but very good nonetheless. The general chicken was excellent.  Very mild which was appreciated by my friends.  I prefer more kick, but again, cooked excellent.  The house noodle was also very good.  Will come back.  I also saw a table that ordered the duck and they stated it was delicious.  Will have to try next time.  

Recently returned.   Chow Mein was excellent.    The fried rice needed something and was a bit bland but not horrible.   The orange chicken was wonderful but sweet.   The spare ribs were fried and covered in maple syrup or honey.   Not my favorite and overly sweet but some in the group lived them.   So I keep the same rating because overall it's a great place to enjoy good Chinese."}
{"text":"Love this place! I've been here a couple of times over the years and it has never disappointed. The arancini di riso appetizer, stuffed eggplant entree, filet mignon entree and duck entree are all amazing. I've also had the lemon cheesecake and creme brulee and they were also amazing! The cheesecake was more fluffy then dense which was a nice change. Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Sent out the Yelp feelers for something tasty. Haven't had Chinese in a while, so why not? Honey walnut shrimp happens to be one of my fav dishes so the siren's song of plump shrimp deep fried in mayo lured me in. We were immediately greeted and seated even though the place quickly filled up. Ordered some potstickers and they arrived quickly. They were good, not great and the service was cold but efficient. Within 10 minutes here came the honey walnut shrimp. Tasty!!!!! Big portion with a spoon meant for sharing. Wife ordered the same and in retrospect we should have ordered something different to share."}
{"text":"Used to be one my favorite places. Today my friend and I showed up at 4:55 and they just watched us outside as we froze.  They said they didn't care and wouldn't open the door until the chef came in. Really?!?!?? You can't let your customers in and relax at the bar for a couple minutes. Needless to say we will never be back nor will any of our other friends."}
{"text":"We went here the day before Christmas for the first time.... and we don't think we'll be coming back again. I'm not sure if this restaurant is new or is not used to busy times. This place was recommended by my cousin, not sure why. The food was extremely salty. The service was pretty terrible which I know is common for most Chinese restaurants but this was by far the worst service I've ever encountered. It was so bad that I saw a couple walk out of the restaurant after being seated and after ordering. The manager chased after them and convinced them to come back. That was entertaining. It would have been fine if the service was bad and the food was good but unfortunately that wasn't the case. Food is average at most. I typically like to have all of the plates hot and all together when I eat dinner but each plate took so long in between that we couldn't wait and had to finish one plate after another."}
{"text":"I got a gift certificate from a family friend at my going away party before I moved here.  For some reason I thought this was an Indian restaurant so was kinda shocked by the Italian menu.

There was this guy that seated us and got us drinks and waters and he was amazing.  He told me his name like 3 times and I wish I could remember it now and give him a shout out cause he was awesome.  Our actual waitress on the other hand was very green i.e. didn't know a lot about the menu and the ingredients, but did nothing wrong.

I ordered the Pescatore and before ordering the white sauce, I asked if this was like a white wine sauce and she said yes so I was assuming that it wouldn't come in a straight up alfredo sauce.  Seriously guys seafood and dairy don't go together so I was kind of upset, but my dude ordered the Tuna which was very nice.  It was sesame crusted and he subbed vegetable risotto for the jasmine rice salad.  The tuna was a little bland but when dipped in the sweet chili sauce it was perfectly flavored.  So I ended up switching with him.

Oh I almost forgot I also got the beet salad to start and it was very good.  The greens in the center had an amazing salad dressing on it and I have been trying to imitate it at home.  My dude got the caprese salad and it came with 2 different types of tomatoes - yellow and red and the yellow were great but the red ones you could tell from the minute the plate was put down were not good toms.  I don't want to talk shit on the Cleve but what's the deal with the toms around here.  Everywhere I go has shitty toms.  It's august, it's tom time.  If you know of a place with good toms send me a shout.

Finally, it was a wine bar, but it had a nice selection of bottles (nothing on draft from what I could tell).  Their seasonal section was nice, with tons of pumpkin beers, mighty tasty."}
{"text":"Our food was incredible, and service was top notch. I would love to return again for dinner."}
{"text":"So we've been here the last 2 Saturday nights and it hasn't disappointed!!  We have definitely found our go-to fave for Chinese food in Vegas, and thankfully it's down the street from our house (anything away from strip & all the traffic & tourists is an automatic plus just to begin with).

We've walked in and been seated immediately (place was about half full both times). Service is great and attentive. We love the newness & decor and the open, bright, CLEAN atmosphere. And although we've ordered with our eyes & empty stomachs (aka too-damn-much for 2 to eat in a single sitting), the bill was very reasonable & less than we are accustomed to paying.

As creatures of habit & not being brave enough to venture with the unknown, we always order the usual:  beef & broccoli, bbq pork fried rice, chicken chow mein (skinny noodles), honey walnut shrimp, and won ton soup.  Everything was served fresh & piping hot, and was delicious. The fried rice was slightly under seasoned but nothing a lil soy sauce or sauce from the beef & broccoli didn't immediately fix.  To top it off each time and as a pleasant surprise, they serve a sweet 'soup' - I don't know what each consisted of but they both (different each night) were hot, sweet and good!! And a great way to clear the palette.

There must be a private room for large parties in the back because each night there was an event going on.  Thankfully, our service was not compromised. But last Saturday every time that back door (which was out of our sight) opened there was extremely loud music (not appealing) - the Hubs guessed that it was karaoke back there but I don't know - we didn't ask.  Worth inquiring about though if having an event or needing a private room....again the food, service and price were on point!

We will definitely be back again and again to TASTE"}
{"text":"5/5 Atmosphere: walking in the first time, you are welcomed by the clean designs and well light high ceilings. Color scheme is very comfortable. 

5/5 Food: Roasted duck was succulent and crispy. Chicken rice noodle soup has a very flavorful broth. Perfect for those who want a light yet filling meal.
Veggies were made to perfection. Not too much oil and not too much salt, it was just right. 

4/5 Service: Waiters we're friendly and attentive. When we asked for service, it would always come quickly. 

Highly recommend for those looking for authentic southern chinese food. It is worth the drive out from the Strip."}
{"text":"Horrible service! I just walked in here and tried to enjoy a dinner with a party of 14. There were 3 tables taken, with no more than 4 people at each table. The lady tried to tell us because our party size we had to rent the private room which is a minimum of $500! There were empty tables but they were reserved for a party. There were other tables available but the lady continued to push the private room. I asked her since she could not accommodate us at the tables could she not charge us the minimum of $500 and she said no. Rude lady, wouldn't seat us and now she lost all of our family's business. Also, the water for for seafood was very dirty. Completely disappointed in there service. We have moved our dinner down the other Chinese restaurant down the street to Rainbow Kitchen."}
{"text":"This is one if the newest Chinese restaurants in the south west. The menu offers a large selection of items including shark, eel and lobster. The service was excellent, all of the employees were friendly and on top of their duties.

We ordered the shrimp walnuts which was very good. I would recommend this dish if you feel like having a sweet dish.

We also ordered the rice noodles with duck. This dish was one of my least favorite. Most of the meat was fried duck skin which was not very tasty.

At the end of our meal we received a complementary bean soup which had some tapioca and a sweet taste to it! We definitely appreciated this gesture especially now that it is getting cold. 

The atmosphere and decor were nice and agreeable. Overall, a good place if you want to enjoy Chinese food in the southwest!"}
{"text":"I truly liked this Chinese restaurant! I read a previous review that it was very clean & they weren't lying! It has a very modern design, no funky smell, and the staff is very respectful providing great service. After every guest left the staff changed the table cloth of the table. When we wanted boxes for our food the staff took our plates & packed it for us in the kitchen. My one year old had a great time looking at the live seafood & the decor. The plates are meant to share family style. We had the honey walnut shrimp, shrimp fried rice, and bbq pork with buns. Sorry theres no picture of the buns I couldn't wait. The taste was good I have to agree again with the previous review about the food. It's not oily & I love that because some Chinese restaurants use to much oil especially in noodles or rice. I think I haven't given this place 5 stars yet because I've had some REALLY good Chinese food growing up BUT this is definitely one of the better Chinese restaurants in Vegas. I would definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"BW

\"Even the tea TASTE bad!\"
We just ate dinner here and we got undercooked flounder.  I requested for a new one or cancel the fish.  I can't believe we got this.  We came in with a party of 26.  I didn't check the bill but I hope I was not charged extra for a new flounder.  I hate the bad service.  I hate the layout here.  But mostly I hate that the flounder was undercooked and pinkish.  The waitress gave us a look and I think they charged us extra to give us a new flounder.  The place is apparently the new HOT SPOT.  I think it's over hype! Don't believe the hype.  I am typing this angry as I just came out of the restaurant annoyed.  The parking lot is BAD.  Park in the back instead.  The restrooms are awesomely clean.  Don't take my personal opinion as a deterrence to come here.  The food was ok.  It's close enough to where I am staying.  I suggest to try it yourself and find out if your taste matches their menu and service.

{"text":"The Best Chinese place we ever been good food friendly service and not bad of a price for all we order. Ell with tausi sauce was fabulous Three ways duck amazing."}
{"text":"Love, love this place! Excellent beers, wines....and the food is top notch! The lamb chops are excellent! My favorite meal! Happy hour is the best deal in town! Appetizers are 1/2 off and $5 wine and drink specials! The owner is super nice and personable!"}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant with some really great food! Only doing a 4 star for now since we only tried a couple things. Soup dumplings, string beans with pork, wonton noodle soup, French style filet mingnon, and the 3 BBQ combo (duck, BBQ pork and roast pork). I thought the dumplings needed a little more flavor, and the string beans were a little too salty but other than that it was ALL delicious! Coming back soon."}
{"text":"Highly recommend this restaurant! It was authentic Chinese food! My waiter was so helpful picking my dinner. I had the clams and black bean sauce, crispy orange beef, pea shoots with garlic sauce and BBQ pork fried rice. Everything was very flavorful!  I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I went here tonight for the first time after often passing by. The food was decent however the service was pretty bad. Our server was barely at our table and it took way too long to get water, get our drinks ect. I'll probably try it again one more time but if the service is similar i won't be returning."}
{"text":"Ordered to go and was ready within 10 minutes only  to discover the food cold (not even slightly warm). Be careful when ordering to-go before closing time or you might get cold food packed into a to-go container."}
{"text":"Another authentic Chinese restaurant in the southwest area! My family decided to give this place a try and sure enough it was what I've asked for. Everything came out so delicious and fresh. I didn't like one thing. Its that only each person get to have one bowl of rice as you know when you eat with a family you would expect it in a small pot and get free refills on the rice. They were going to charge extra if you wanted some more rice. That was one thing that I dislike. We ordered a lot of different types of food such as Seafood hot pot, pork dumplings, salt pepper shrimp, and basal clams and each only have 1 bowl of rice?!? Hmmm..  The area is very nice and modern-looking. There's a lot of space around the parking lot so it's easy to find. Definitely worth coming back but I hope that they can make it more authentic by providing more rice for the customers without charge."}
{"text":"The food was delicious at a wine-pairing dinner and the hosts/owners were very friendly.  Taste will not fail you if you are looking to impress.  The bar is classy and the outdoor seating is secluded.  When the restaurant is busy the acoustics make it very loud, but otherwise: another great place in the Heights."}
{"text":"We got in to Vegas after traveling all day and I was browsing Yelp. This place popped up as a new and exciting restaurant. The first pic I saw saw Walnut Shrimp and I was sold! I love Walnut Shrimp and theirs did not disappoint! Nice restaurant with a live seafood tank. For being a newer place, it was already packed. There looked to be some awesome stuff on the menu. I wouldn't hesitate to go back and give it another try."}
{"text":"authentic cantonese food here, try their lunch special, has the spicy beef noodle soup, which is pretty good, portion is reasonable, will try their dinner later."}
{"text":"My camera was at 10% so sadly I couldn't take a picture of the two dishes I ordered.

The restaurant is clean and love the openness of the floor. I did have to wait a while before being greeted and sat because there was no host/ess when I walked it.

Not to sound biased but I do base the restaurant by its clientele haha. Seeing as most of the restaurant goers were mostly Chinese I knew I was in a good place (that and another friend suggested this restaurant to another friend to try).

XLB, Xia Long Bao. Always a must order item wherever they have it. However, their interpretation was lacking. The soup was not inside the dumpling at all. The filling was mostly pork. Tasted great, but I seemed to get the poorly made ones because there was no soup in center at all. Major disappointment for sure.

The next item I ordered was the Chicken and Jellyfish with Sesame Seeds. The only disappointment in this dish was it did not look like their picture in the menu. The menu shows there was more chicken than jellyfish. But what I got was inverted. More jellyfish than the poached chicken. 

This refreshing yet spicy dish was the highlight of the meal. The coldness of the dish (seeing as it is served cold due to the jellyfish) was what I needed on this hot day. The cooling effect of the pickled radish and carrots helped offset the spiciness of the dish.

I will definitely be back to try more of the menu items with pictures to go with it. I would've given them a rating of 3 for sure but the main dish and their service is their saving grace. I hate having to call my server to refill my water. This shows me that they do not pay attention to my needs as a guest. Here, they were the ones asking me if I needed more water without me asking. Also the tea pot they serve upon sitting down helped with my thirst. I also really appreciate the fact that they did not automatically give me a fork. They didn't assume!"}
{"text":"Don't know too much about the xiao long Bao game but ours was dry and hard and had no soup in it.. The lunch special chicken and duck was good tho"}
{"text":"I have mixed reviews about this place. Came here with reservations for 7 on a Wednesday night to celebrate the mid autumn festival with friends. We ordered the crab curry, spicy eggplant clay pot, garlic sautéed greens, house special crispy noodles, walnut prawns, and half a roast duck.

Atmosphere: 5 stars. For a Cantonese restaurant, this space was beautiful, new and well decorated. 

Food:  4 stars the crab curry ( 40 bucks per crab regardless of weight) was delicious!  It comes with plain buns for you to soak up that delicious flavorful curry sauce. The crab is deep friend first so the outside had a delicious crispy coating. By far my favorite dish and was totally worth it. The other dishes were not bad. The walnut prawns were large and crispy. Cooked perfectly so it wasn't too chewy. The crispy noodles were also good as well. The greens were a little tough and chewy. 

Service: 1 stars. 
No one was rude or anything but service was incredibly slow. We had to ask several times for water to be filled and our dessert and bill came 15 mins after we asked for it the second time.   

The food also came out painfully slow. Like one dish at a time. We would finish one dish and had to wait hungrily for the next. We ate nothing together. The last dish to come out was the veggies... Which is really weird because we just ate plain veggies at the end. Our eggplant never even made it out. We had to cancel it because we've been at the restaurant for 2.5 hours already....  Service was terrible. 

Overall the food was great. I will come again to see if service improves."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service!   The best Chinese food in town!!! Everything we had was so good! They also have fresh live fish that they will steam for you- a must try!  The taro tapioca at the end is just so good as well!"}
{"text":"Decided to try it randomly with the Mrs..... had  the soup of the day & the fish of the day. We originally walked in 20mins before closing but the Bartender served us & was super sweet. AND THE FOOD WAS WORTH EVERY DOLLAR! Beautiful place & even the ppl on the balcony were super sweet. Want brownie points? take your date here"}
{"text":"I went to the bar here for drinks and it was awesome. Really cool bartenders and atmosphere. They even had a piano player. I can't wait to come back for a meal next time."}
{"text":"At first glance, if the food was going to be as good as the place looked, this place was going to be the Nuke-bomb.  But alas, the high expectations exploded.    Ended up ordering the szechuan spicy soup fish, and the Taiwanese 3 cups chicken.   Now, if you don't know the rule, the general rule is, Youre not supposed to order szechuan and taiwanese cuisine in a cantonese restaurant.  Stick with what the restaurant originates from.  Chefs will add dishes to the menu to placate the masses.  

The food wasnt bad, it was good.  I think it was just the high expectations.   The 3 cups chicken came out really really sweet, and really really salty but still had a good flavor..  The szechuan soup fish was also a bit salty.  And it was a bit milder in spicyness.  

I still want to come back.  Next time i'll be trying the cantonese cuisine and see how it goes.  I still feel confident about this place and will give it another shot.

The service was a bit slow and unresponsive due to serious understaffing as they only had 2 waiters on staff, that did the bussing, ordering, cleaning, filling the water, serving the dishes.  Felt bad for them, I think the fault lies with the business owner.
 .

5/18/2018 - I had to change the rating to a 5 from 4.   It's my favorite cantonese style food in vegas, a little on the pricey side, and the private room cost minimum 500 bucks but good."}
{"text":"We are regulars! Love their salt n pepper fish fillet and shrimp lo mein. Just those two alone can feed 2-3 people for $21. This is by far the best Chinese restaurant in Vegas! It will not disappoint. My only wish is they would have party trays"}
{"text":"I like to eat Chinese Foods here. The food taste good. Very clean and nice service. Will come more often if we can."}
{"text":"Worst high-end restaurant experience in a long time. Had to ask for the customary bread, waiter didn't understand the drink or food menu well at all, the seafood was NOT fresh tasting whatsoever (stay away from all seafood here) and my husbands steak came out cold. Not acceptable for a restaurant that averages $50/person. Will NOT try again."}
{"text":"I would say this was my first time trying Cantonese food and it was very different but actually delicious. We had this filet mignon plate, pork with salty fish, dumplings, and crab with fried rice. To be honest, all these plates were pretty saucy and salty so I would recommend to eat white rice on the side. They also gave us this hot red bean with mandarin orange in it(?) for dessert and that was really good! The staffs were very friendly and the restaurant was nice and clean."}
{"text":"Extremely overpriced. Doesn't worthit at all. It's close to home so I ordered from there often. The most recent time I ordered, the portion was very small so I called and tried to talk to the manager. The manager was rude and didn't even bother to talk on the phone with me and passed it to the employee. That's how they treat regular customers!"}
{"text":"So special restaurant. Food are very good. Especially the seafoods. And to my surprise, they have Karaoke in the room. After eat too much delicious food, it's a good time to exercise"}
{"text":"We were seated immediately and served graciously and promptly in this restaurant with modern yet warm ambiance.    

Miss S. ordered a scallop appetizer.  I let her order for both of us.  (I did order my own high-gravity ale--good value--of which several were available, and it was great.)  There were three scallops.  The best.  They were wonderfully seasoned, or marinated, or...something.  Then we ordered lambchops, of which there were also three, and we split them, too.  I am not a lamb person but they were pretty damn good!  They had just the perfect proportions of fat, which lent flavor, and tenderness (and no chewiness).  Then we sampled/split a great chocolate mousse, which we enjoyed but did not have to finish.   I like larger portions in general, but I felt full in spite of the splitting.  The \"meal in a glass\" I drank probably helped.   Miss S. met and complimented the very friendly owner.       

Free parking in rear."}
{"text":"One of my new favorite spots to eat in Vegas. Food was delicious and plenty to go around. The Peking Duck, soup dumpling, filet, honey spare rib, and fried noodles were on point!"}
{"text":"The food was good. The place is new and very clean. The service was great! They have 2 private rooms for dining and karaoke!! They also own the Ohana Hawaiian restaurant next door and serve their drinks! I'm definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Idk idk. I feel like everything is overpriced. I ordered green beans with XO sauce and Szechuan style chicken. $13 for green beans?? Tasted great and they had that perfect slight snappy crunch to them, but still. And I wasn't aware the chicken dish was a cold dish so it kinda threw me off but I'm not marking them off for that, that was my fault. Service was good. Maybe I'll try their crispy pork or duck next time if I'm in the mood."}
{"text":"This place was decent and I wouldn't mind returning.

Like most of the reviews have said - it's new and in the southwest - so lots of space and the restaurant doesn't smell as much as the older chinese restaurants yet.

The crab curry was definitely a highlight.We also really liked the honey walnut shrimp.  They also had BOGO bubble tea.

I think my implicit issue with this restaurant is that it's promoted as a Szechuan restaurant but everything was under-spiced.  The hottest thing tried was like a 2/5 spiciness compared to other restaurants. 

We got:
Hot & sour soup: 4/5
soup dumplings: 4/5 - can't compare to din tai fung but decent
Salt and pepper shrimp: 4/5 - delicious but the one over at lotus of siam is infinitely better
honey walnut shrimp: 5/5 - really enjoyed this.
Szechuan chicken with jalapenos: 3/5 - why was this dish not spicy??
Broccoli Beef: 3/5 - tons of broccoli. very little beef. Also under seasoned
Pea shoots: 3/5 - underseasoned
Crab Curry: 5/5 - definitely one of the best things there. The buns are also delicious
BBQ pork: 3/5 - little seasoning

Food came out fast and presentation was decent. Just wish they had spicier szechuan food!"}
{"text":"Our normal go to Chinese restaurant now.  Very convenient to SW residents, clean and open environment, and pretty tasty food.  I would recommend this to anyone wants Cantonese Chinese food in Vegas."}
{"text":"Always wanted to visit and I was not disappointed. Great Beet and Goat Cheese Salad. Perfectly cooked hanger steak. A great destination on Lee Road. I will return"}
{"text":"The place is super clean, bright and shiny new.  The food was really well done and tasty.  We ordered:

Xiao long Bao 
Spicy fish hot pot 
Salt and pepper pork chops 
Chinese broccoli with dried fish

The soup dumplings were on point.  The hot pot should have had more fish for the cost.  The pork chops were hot, spicy, and tender.  The Chinese broccoli was well done but overpriced.  For the two of us and the 4 dishes it was 54 bucks and all we had was hot tea to drink.  

The service was disjointed and needs to have more structure.  We really don't know who our waiter was as 4-5 people handled the table as they rushed around. 

I wanted to give this place 5 stars but I just can't due to the cost and the haphazard service.  The meal was about 10 bucks more than it should have been.  The service needs to be rethought."}
{"text":"I was quite disappointed with this restaurant. Food was really not good, it wasn't horrible but really nothing special. The place I must say is one of the nicest and cleanest looking Chinese restaurant in Vegas, off the strip. The price was also way higher compared to the rest.

I had the following :
- walnut shrimp - really bland, too much mayo 
- Xia  long bao - the soupy dumpling - really tough, skin would stuck to the bottom, tasteless, seemed old 
- sweet and sour Pork- way too sweet and very greasy
-Fried rice - pretty decent 
- eggplant in a hot pot - really really not worth it 

I'm still deciding whether to give this place another shot, maybe I had a combination of the wrong things? But whatever it is, I really feel I wasted my money"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by my experience in this mostly Italian restaurant. 

I got the Chicken Saltimbocca. It wasn't stuffed, but had prosciutto and cheese on top of it, came with a side of sautéed spinach, a side of masalas mushrooms and really flavorful saffron rice. There were a lot of flavors involved, and a lot of food in general, but I really liked everything. The ham and snow pea risotto that came with the Chicken Breast entrée was also really good.  

The place was reasonably busy for a Thursday night both at the bar for happy hour (5-7p) and the dining room. The happy hour menu offered half off apps, which was a good deal and one could certainly get full with a selection of apps. I tried the appetizer pizza of the day and it was good. The crust was very thin and flakey and the toppings were generous. There was also a good wine list. 

Service was friendly and fast overall. This place was wasn't unique to the point where I would get a taste for it specifically, but if in the area I would certainly consider returning."}
{"text":"Favorite new Chinese seafood spot. Will for sure be back! Very clean and great customer service! The food was huge portions and we had to take it home for leftovers! Try the Peking duck and the lettuce wraps!"}
{"text":"I had the Hainan chicken lunch special for $10 and it was delicious. My only issue was how small the order was. I'd go back to try other dishes...the Hainan chicken alone gave me the sense they make some quality Chinese food.

I'd bump this to 5 stars if the lunch special portions were larger!"}
{"text":"Walked in for Christmas with my party. The place was almost empty but lady said all other tables are reserved. They wanted to usher us to a private room but the minimum order is $500. There's no way my party would ever order that much food. We asked if we could just do a regular order they declined our patronage. I will not be coming back because of the lack of understanding from the restaurant."}
{"text":"I had the French style filet mignon. They don't specify but they cooked it on the medium rare end, which I am ok with. However, some chunks were basically inedible, which at $18, is less than satisfying, and the sauce is a bit too heavy, such that I get very little of the taste of the meat out of the dish. I've had a similar but better incarnation of this dish in Chicago. Not a bad experience,  but not particularly outstanding. One positive is that it can be enough for two meals if you're not particularly hungry."}
{"text":"We took a chance on this place looking for a local Chinese and glad we did. Very delicious food! Legit Chinese ran place with the normal items you would expect plus things I didnt know what they were. I had the orange chicken and it was bomb dot com. Good quiet atmosphere too."}
{"text":"Found our new favorite restaurant. Very nice venue all around. Entered for our 6 o'clock reservation. The room was empty. Ok. Our first very cold snow evening. That explains it. The hostess said, \"Oh, no. You must have a reservation. The room will fill up!\"  And so it did!!  By 6:50 the tables were filled. The waiter was kind and informative. We started with the calamari. It was not fried, but sautéed and presented in a broth. Was light and good. The  Veal Francaise was lightly breaded with a Chardonnay-lemon butter sauce. Full of flavor! The roasted duck breast with Demi glacé was tender and the wild rice was delicious. The Fettuccine ai Frutti di Mare was a best meal as my husband raved about it!  The gentlemen who appeared to be the owner chatted with us. We left very happy. Free parking is south of the building. Metered parking is behind the building. Parking in the library's lot is allowed."}
{"text":"Wrong order for the third time, and do not take responsibility, bad service, rude,never going back...
Such a Shame"}
{"text":"For some reason, I thought this was a fast food type of Chinese restaurant so when I walked in for the first time I was very surprised to see that it's a full sit down restaurant! It's nicely decorated inside and I appreciate that this type of Chinese restaurant has opened on this side of town, saving us the drive to Spring Mountain! 

For the food, we ordered Peking duck, lettuce wraps, beef chow fun, egg drop soup, and fried tofu. When the Peking duck came out with the steam buns, it was really cool to see the chef actually cutting the crispy skin off the duck. My bf said he has never eaten Peking duck where the skin was so perfectly cut off from the meat. 

Everything else we ordered was really good and I'd definitely want to come back to try the other dishes such as the fried flounder, fried rice, and maybe another noodle dish. However, the reason I took off a star was because service was pretty bad here. One server took our order and never came back and we had to ask a different server for additional things. They never came back to check on us once and even forget to bring out some things we asked for like soy sauce. Then it took forever to get to go boxes and the bill."}
{"text":"Service was excellent. Gaudi helped me make great choices for my first time there. The restaurant week menu was not limited and had legitimate options/ portions. Mussels appetizer was amazing. Veal fancaise was so delicious. My cheesecake was just the right size and was good, let's be honest, all cheese cake is at least good. Drinks were make correctly and well. Definitely would go again!"}
{"text":"Ordered food to go on Christmas Day:
-3lb lobster, harbor style
-Peking pork chops
-Ribeye in garlic sauce
-1/2 roast duck
- Fu Zhou style fried rice
- Ong Choy sautéed w/garlic

Food was outstanding, service fantastic. Man I spoke to on the phone was very helpful & the food was ready in 20 min. Have also dined in twice & had a pleasant experience both times. Pricier than rainbow kitchen but worth it!"}
{"text":"Came to try Taste, a new restaurant close by. Very clean and well lit. The food was very authentic. we had Westlake Beef soup - delicious. Xialong bao was very good but not very much juice inside. Seafood tofu was also good. Service was not great, as water was empty for a while before anyone thought of refilling them. Saltfish hash was a little too salty, but still good. Also had seafood noodle dish and chinese broccoli which were also very good. I felt the meal was a little over priced, but overall very good. Especially since we didn't have to drive to Chinatown. Will try again."}
{"text":"YUM!!  I can't figure out why this place is never packed???  On our most recent trip here on a Friday night I was shocked by how few people were here. I had the eggplant dish and it was delish!!  I went out on the edge with this one because I can be kinda iffy on eggplant but at Taste it was awesome.  My husband had a seafood plate which he said was awesome....I don't eat seafood so I took his word for it!!"}
