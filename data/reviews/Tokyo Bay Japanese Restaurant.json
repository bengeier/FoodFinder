{"text":"Let me temper this review by stating that I am not overally familiar with japanese cuisine and maybe this is standard for the fare but I thought the food was pretty bland. The salad dressing tasted like watery thousand island dressing and the meat was fatty. The booths with private curtains, the tv playing the strange japanese shows were fun and the service was friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"I have never been to a Japanese Sushi place quite like this. All the seating was booths with privacy curtains (which I thought was fun). Shrimp chips were brought to our table and I have never had them, but enjoyed every bite.  My friend and I started off with some rolls and they were great. Then we decided on Sushi Pizza, which i have never hear of. And it was awesome.  It is my new favorite sushi dish. Over all the service was great and we had a great time. I will definitely come here again."}
{"text":"GENERAL NOTES This used to be the best sushi in Oakville, which tells you something about the quality of sushi in Oakville. Now, it's good, a fair bet. Expect a good meal, but not a great one.  MENU RECOMMENDATIONS There's nothing that really stands out to me here.   SERVICE NOTES As with any Japanese restaurant, expect excellent, if not attentive service. We've trained our women well.  LOCATION NOTES Located in the heart of Kerr Village on Kerr between Rebecca and Lakeshore.  HUMOUROUS STORY This is one of the 4-6 sushi restaurants I've eaten alone at. I am that sad. And hungry."}
{"text":"Don't be put off by the exterior, which needs a bit of a refresh.  Food is great, sashimi was excellent and the dragon roll was fresh and very tasty.  Great prices for lunch - a hidden gem.  Back to try the sukiyaki !"}
{"text":"I absolutely concur with Brian G., this used to be best sushi restaurant in Oakville. It has gone downhill over the past two years which is a shame as the people who run it are really nice."}
{"text":"Blergh. I hope I find better sushi in Oakville, or this is not going to be an easy move!   The place is cute enough, with lots of bench seating with privacy curtains - I noticed some booths had TVs, but unfortunately not mine! Or fortunately, depending how much you like your dining partner I suppose...   I found the menu kind of overpriced but was hoping it would be worth it. $17ish for a sushi lunch is a BIT hefty unless you have some quality sushi! I ordered this overpriced sushi lunch, and my dining partner had udon.   Let's start with the udon - the broth was decent, but it actually included carrots and celery? What??? That is just not right. My sushi was definitely blah - the california roll was definitely below my standard - full of mayo and generally not fresh tasting. Everything we had was on a range from meh to gross, so really, not the best lunch ever.   Will I be back? No. The quest for Oakville sushi continues!"}
{"text":"Just found out that my favorite restaurant, Tokyo Bay, has closed.  I moved from Oakville to Dundas several years ago but regularily made the trip back for dinner or sometimes lunch to Tokyo Bay.  No reason for me to come to Oakville any longer.  I am  sad."}
{"text":"took my very good friend out to toyko bay she was very impressed. tokyo bay is a great restaraunt.  i wouldn't recommend this place for children under the age of 10, unless your chldren like sushi"}
