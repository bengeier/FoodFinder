{"text":"I have never written a Yelp review before, but just can't recommend this place enough.  It is a real find.  My friends and I were there on a Wednesday night.  That night's dinner special was eggplant Parmesan.  After being informed by the waitress that the dish was made to order, instead of being pre-made in a large batch, we didn't even bother to look at the rest of the menu.  Our meals came with a nice garden salad and fresh Italian bread. The eggplant, which was sliced thin, lightly breaded, flash fried, topped with sauce and cheese and then baked, was probably the best I have ever eaten.  The total cost for three people  was $24 plus tip.  What a deal.  I can't wait to eat there again next time I am in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Not sure why this restaurant is found on Yelp under \"Conte's\" and \"Conte\".  I just wrote a review under \"Conte\" which has more reviews than this one.  Check the other one if you are planning on going.  Out of this world homemade Italian food!"}
{"text":"Wow...this is the real deal.  Small, strip mall place, near the airport, it was fantastic. Family owned and operated, start with caprese and/or bruchetta.  Many, if not most pasta from scratch and plate are large, so you could easily split, say two dishes for three. Deserts are wonderful, assuming you have any room left!  They have beer, yet no wine, so bring it with you.  This is a treat, a place that you might drive by a million times and never stop...the next tine, stop!"}
{"text":"The first time i was there for a 40th bday the  food was amazing, but service was very disorganized. Our family went back for another bday party and it was horrible. We made reservation waaay ahead of time and they were still very unprepared. They did not have homemade gnocchi (which is why the bday girl picked this place). It was only 6pm in the evening so its not like they ran out! No lemon for waters, no sugar or creamer for coffee and the food was just ok at this visit! OH and then they brought the wrong dinner to the table and seemed put off by fixing it and the one dish that asked for meat sauce had NO meat.  Very chaotic experience! I would probably not go back. After reading the above review i def will not go there!! WOW...who do these men and business owners think they are? I'm posting to both of their links so this message is seen by all!"}
{"text":"Simple the best traditional Neapolitan food in the area. This is a small, Trattoria just like you would find in Italy. No alcohol served, but Maria more than makes up for that with her love for her craft.  All the offerings are served fresh, so no 5 minute meals here. 

Try the Limoncello Gelato after dinner. She imports it from Italy in a small Asti glass.

Molto Bene!"}
{"text":"I cant find words to describe how great my meal just was. The waitress told me their most highly acclaimed dish is th Pollo de la Chef and it did not disappoint. This is without a doubt the best italian place I've found in Cleveland. I live 45 minutes away but guarantee Ill be back shortly. You cannot go wrong here."}
{"text":"Always delicious food at contes! We had chicken Marsala, chicken Parmesan and gnocchi sorentino! And now we are full and happy!! And they are updating the dining room!  The food however needs no improvement. Perfecto!!"}
{"text":"I was a regular at Contes when I lived down the street from the original location. I refer any and everyone who is looking for Italian as they make the best in Cleveland in my opinion. When I found out they relocated to Front Row I immediately planned to make a trip across town to enjoy one of my favorite meals. I called ahead and they insisted that it was the same exact food that was served at the original location. When seated I didn't even need a menu because I knew I wanted the Fettuccine Alfredo add chicken. Contes has never been inexpensive so I didn't expect it to be inexpensive here either despite the bar setting. However it was a surprising $13 which was a bit cheaper than Contes if I remember correctly. 

I received my salad accompanied by a tiny premade toasted dinner roll. Anyone who frequents Contes knows that the bread is always freshly made but I let it fly. The salad was different as well because the original Contes salad never came with cheese let alone two types. And the dressing taste like normal Italian which must have also been premade. I suspect things may have changed a little because after all this is just a small bar and no longer the authentic little Italian restaurant I used to frequent. It took a while to come out which didn't bother me either because I know it takes time to make such a good meal. I used to watch the owner prepared the meal straight from her kitchen therefore the wait never bothered me. 

Anywho when I received my pasta my boyfriend immediately asked was it a lunch portion and I thought the same but decided not to complain. The noodles were linguini and not fettuccine but that didn't bother me either. Another change was the fact that the chicken was cut into small square pieces and they were beyond dry. I'm used to a very moist whole piece of chicken or two. The worse part was the fact that the noodles way undercooked and clumped together. The alfredo sauce didn't even taste the same and there were no roasted garlic cloves. Because I respect the food Contes has produced in the past I decided not to picture the food because it was just that bad. I tried to eat it but I just couldn't so I told the waiter (who by the way was very nice). She insisted that it was the original Conte family in the back preparing the food and that she would have it fixed. However, I was totally turned off and declined. 

I really miss Contes and I hope that one day they return in a different location and serve the same home cooked meals they once produced. I enjoyed going there after a long day at work and enjoying a great meal accompanied by good customer service from the family."}
