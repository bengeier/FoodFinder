{"text":"This is a great place for coffee, but it's not my cup of tea for food. 

I like the atmosphere, especially now that they've expanded (before I remember this place being pretty cramped). It is a bit loud when it's packed but it's nice, bright, and airy. 

The coffee is also delicious and it's one of the few places where you can find a real flat white, just like what you would get in New Zealand. 

The food is too over the top for me. I'd prefer some more simplistic stuff on the menu. If I recall correctly, they used to have a grilled cheese on the menu that was really good but now it seems to only be on the kids menu. 

I'd re-visit this place for a coffee some time but don't know if I'd come back to eat anything."}
{"text":"One of the best coffee's I have ever tasted. Fresh tasting with body without burnt bitterness and no after taste lingering in out mouth. The food there is delicious. Atmosphere is bright, airy, clean and modern. Friendly staff made it the complete awesome experience."}
{"text":"Had lunch at Kerr Street Cafe on a Sunday in November. Wasn't busy, we got a table right away. 

The menu was simple, and for some reason felt good to not have many options. 

I ordered the smoked salmon frittata which came with a side of the garden salad. The frittata/quiche was very good, could have used a little less salt in my opinion. I love smoked salmon, and I saw someone else get the bagel and cream cheese with smoked salmon which looked amazing - with generous amounts of smoked salmon. I'll probably get that the next time I'm there. 

The service is great - staff is very courteous and friendly, make you feel right at home.

They ended up serving us and everyone else there dessert on the house - was cinnamon roll with a mocha sauce(?)

I'd definitely recommend checking them out if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Food is good, service is good. Will definable come back. Only one thing: why charged me $2 for one cup of hot water?!"}
{"text":"Liam H. is spot on with his review. As an Australian living in the area this coffee is exactly like good cafes at home.

I don't know why every other place with a coffee machine cannot get the milk as silky as these guys! If you enjoy a latte, this is your place in Oakville."}
{"text":"My gf and I here came here on a Sunday so it wasn't too busy.  We ordered and managed to find a seat without a fuss.  I'm glad it was a calm setting... good for a nice private conversation and to just sit back and relax

The cafe itself is small but don't get me wrong its designed nicely on the inside.  The feeling I got from the desserts being shown was that it was all freshly made... Maybe cuz it wasn't decorated elaborately.  It gave that kind of feeling where you know someone just recently baked it and it's not ordered from some other bakery.

We came here because my GF had heard this place was good for Latte art.  My gf orderd the all white or white something drink (sorry I don't remember the name) since she's lactose intolherant.  They didn't really design it like the other pictures usual depict... I think...  But the GF said it was REALLY good

I got the fish buritos!! with the arugula!!  I really enjoyed this dish mainly because I love arugula.  The type of fish that was used was a mahi mahi fish.  Together with avocado, what's not to like?!  I'm glad I ordered this dish as it was very tasty!

The GF ordered the Eggs benedicts which is probably one of their most popular dishes.  Eggs were poached and presented nicely.  They weren't soaked in the hollandaise sauce which was good

I got a take out slice of lime cheese cake... it was SOOOO good.. *drool* If they ever have that cake available I definitely recommend trying it!

Conclusion:  I recommend this place if you're looking for a quiet place to enjoy a meal by yourself or with a friend.  I went on a Sunday so maybe that's why it wasn't as busy.  I've been told by others that it can get busy on Saturday or during dinner time."}
{"text":"Decided to pop in for a last minute pick me up after along day of running around and I was plesently surprised with the smooth cream flavour of my flat white. The my coffee was so good a came back the next day lol
 I will be back for a sit down soon to try their food."}
{"text":"Shared the French toast and big breakfast with my girlfriend. Times like this when I wish I was single."}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place. Such a cozy place.

I love the eggs benedict. My husband hates eggs benedict, but would actually eat it only at Kerr Street Cafe.  

We are also both very addicted to the latte. Yum yum yum!!!"}
{"text":"A sweet place for our Sunday brunch last weekend. Loved the eggs Benny on cornbread. Delicious and perfectly made!  Place was full but we found seats fairly quickly and the staff is very sweet. Enjoyed my cappuccino and my husband loved that they brought hot milk for his coffee per his request."}
{"text":"This is a bakery cafe style restaurant. Simple, to the point and nice food and service. 
Local flock here far and wide, breakfast and brunch are the busiest times. Casual atmosphere, good food, nice location in downtown Oakville on Kerr Street. Parking depending on the day is not free but I have been able to find a spot in front of the cafe for the times I have gone. Lots to choose from for breakfast or lunch. There are also fresh juices and you can order or buy food to take home."}
{"text":"Love the eggs Benny on cornbread. Amazing cafe,classy n healthy food . Very clean and nice staff. Def coming back n would recommend to abyone"}
{"text":"The food and coffee are great but $6 for a large coffee and toast with cream cheese? C'mon. I think they are going for the \"the more you charge, the more rich people will think it's great\" thing."}
{"text":"I am luck to just live down the street from this cafe :)  The frozen to go meals are delicious and super convenient.  My son loves the cookies they keep in a jar near the register.  And, as mentioned in every other review, the coffee/lattes are amazing!"}
{"text":"Nice ambiance. Adjusted to off menu salad by kitchen when a sandwich not available. Great for fresh made brunch items."}
{"text":"The Kerr St Cafe  has wonderful meals in a very modern atmosphere. High, high ceilings, nicely designed - a good meeting place.Cafeteria style- so gaze at the art work while waiting to order. I hope they never sell some of the big pieces- they have become favourites. 
Mark- the guardian of the espresso counter - has gone back home-  and is missed. Meghan, however, has become my favourite barista.Her chai latte is unrivalled in the city.
The chefs make delicious brunches and deserve high marks.
The downside ..as with any successful eaterie- is getting a table. I wouldnt want to see the place expand..but it is disappointing to arrive at noon and find all seats taken. Go before noon..or after two and  linger....."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick bite and settled on the fish burrito and apple cider. Nice to see that they've expanded the restaurant since last time, making it a lot more comfortable. Staff is young and hip, food is excellent and portions are just right. However, service is frigging slow and a good half hour passed before our food arrived. I would definitely come back if I had time for a long lunch. Clean bathrooms and great for families."}
{"text":"A great place for coffee and lunch. The lattes came out fast and tasted delicious. 
The food has never failed to impress me. The heuvos rancheros is delicious and so are the desserts. 
The design is modern but very cozy and the staff is always friendly and quick! Will definitely be coming here again!"}
{"text":"Presentation for the dishes were great. Ordered French toast and eggs benedict on toast, a bit disappointed in the favouring and portion, and especially the pricing for the dishes. I guess this spot is geared towards a specific audience. Service was great however."}
{"text":"Amazing French toast, breakfast food and flat whites. The freshly squeezed orange juice is amazing. 
The mocha wasn't that great though. 
Definitely coming back here to try other things on the menu"}
{"text":"Oakville notoriously lacks \"great\" restaurants and cafe's - but you're in luck with this one. The moment I sat down here I knew it would be a hit.

Like most other reviews here say, the atmosphere is wonderful. The decor is modern, fresh and open. They have the right amount of noisiness on a Saturday morning, and things calm down by the afternoon. I come here often to do some work (although there's only one socket)!

But the food, without a doubt, is the reason I keep coming back.

- The Eggs Benedict is a unique take on a tried-and-true, with perfectly poaches eggs and spinach atop tasty jalapeno cornbread... all smothered in the right amount of hollandaise. I order bacon on the side).
- Their yogurt & granola is also divine, is you're in for something healthier.

My friends and family have tried the steak sandwich, chicken and brie sandwich, huevos rancheros and french toast- and couldn't stop raving about it afterwards.

This place is worth a go, just once. I promise you'll be hooked!"}
{"text":"My absolute favorite place for breakfast/brunch! My husband and I recently move from Toronto to Oakville and we've probably tried almost every brunch place in Toronto. So it was only natural that our #1 task when we moved was to find a nice brunch place. Wasn't long after our move we found Kerr Street cafe and instantly fell in love! Our search is over! The food and service is just phenomenal... Love everything on the menu. But my most favorite is the chorizo omelette... Yum yum yum! Next is the fresh toast... Omg... I'm getting hungry just typing this. Lol. And the coffee... Wow! Fresh juice... The list just goes on and on. Can't wait to see their new space... Definitely de 'breakfast' place."}
{"text":"Trendy cafe location with good coffee and healthy food. Staff here are super friendly and down to earth. Would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of coffee and I ordered the latte here and my husband ordered the cappuccino and they did not have latte art like the pictures showed. I wanted to send it back but decided against it because they were busy. But then I thought about it and thought I paid the same money as anyone else my experience shouldn't be lacking. I still didn't complain but figured based on my experience would write a review. 

Me and my husband ended up spending $80 here for brunch and sadly it didn't even live up to our coras breakfast experience. 

I give it 1 star because their French toast was delicious. But honestly our entres and drinks truly left something to be desired. Very Small portions."}
{"text":"Been meaning to try this place for awhile now and I'm somewhat satisfied. 
Located on Kerr Street in Oakville it has a bistro flare with lots of charm. 
Parking is limited to what is available on the street. This small bistro features really cute country/rustic decor. Servers are very friendly and gracious to help with my selection. 
The menu was brief and featured breakfast options. Not your typical breakfast menu, more gourmet and the prices reflected it. I tried the eggs Florentine with the ricotta pancakes and the village juicery cold pressed juice. Roughly $90 for the both of us and I'm not sure if it was worth the money. The quality seemed really fresh and the portions were substantial; I'm just not seeing where the prices are justified. 
Give it a try if you can't get into Stoney's across the way or if you just want to try a country/bistro breakfast place."}
{"text":"Great friendly staff and so far the best brunch place in downtown Oakville. 
Plus, Coffee here is a worth of try!"}
{"text":"I think I'm in love!  Mark is not only charming and good-looking (with a bonus kiwi accent), he's a pro behind the bar.  I could definitely incorporate a visit to Kerr Street Café into my morning routine.

I have very little barista experience (about two years), but enough to know when something's not right (like when they burn my soy or inadvertently make me a free-pour cappuccino when I don't want all that foam).  I'm already pretty cranky first thing in the morning and the last thing I need is a ruined latte.  This is what generally happens at chain establishments or places that pretend to know what they're doing.

Enter Kerr Street Café.  Mark is my hero.  I could spend the day just watching him make beverages.  He's the best barista I have ever met!

I was also starving this morning and was thrilled to find freshly baked scones near the cash.  I got a large cinnamon scone to go with my latte.  I love that it's not super dry like most scones I've had.

My only complaint is their hours.  Closed on Mondays and open 8 to 4ish (the \"ish\" is actually on their sign!)."}
{"text":"Best flat white coffee!  Reminds me of my stay in Australia!  Love the eggs on toast with avocado and lightly cooked small tomatoes! So fresh and tasty. Friendly staff and good service.  Atmosphere is very relaxing when it's not too busy."}
{"text":"French Toast with toasted coconut and blueberry compote was 'off the hook! Nice chill atmo remincent of Queen street Toronto. Takes Apple Pay! Worth another bicycle pitstop. Maybe they will have a patio one day??"}
{"text":"This place has been bookmarked as \"to try\" on Yelp for almost a year. Ever since I included them in a Weekly Yelp newsletter about coffee shops and read about their signature coffees such as the fluffy (for kids) and the flat white (a take on the traditional cafe late). I was thrilled to visit recently and I gotta say it's tops all the way around.

To kick things off I went for the well reviewed flat white except made with almond milk to make it easier on my stomach. Taste wise I really couldn't tell the difference between this and a late BUT when they presented it with a swan in the latte art I was converted. Clearly a superior drink, I mean come on... a swan!

Midway through my coffee I got peckish and decided on some breakfast, I wanted something high in protein and flavour but low in carbs. The staff here had little hesitation recommending the the Spanish eggs for breakfast (completely paleo friendly) - a long running special that has slowly begun to take root on the permanent menu. What an amazing breakfast concept! Stewed tomatoes, sweet potatoes, chorizo sausage, peppers onions and Jalapeno slices that are pickled in-house!

I figured after that breakfast feed, that I'd be set for awhile, and trust me I was. I made use of their free WiFi and  free lemon-lime water for hours as I enjoyed the foot traffic and AMAZING soundtrack they played in store. All my faves: Dallas Green, Ray Lamontagne, Jack Johnson, etc - very chill.

When the lunch rush had died down, I got my second wind for food and decided on the Chicken burger (made with a whole chicken breast chopped up) with curry mayo (to die for), I mentioned that I wasn't a fan of having the Bun and without even a hesitation the accommodated my request and made into a salad instead of a burger

The staff here were accomodating, and super friendly. I spoke with their barista, server, and head chef all day, always coming by to say hi, see what I was doing, and let me work there all day without a worry. I LOVE this cafe, and will be back many many times"}
{"text":"Came here because Stoney's was closed. Never again. 

Food is not tasty and portions are small. None of the servers cracked a smile and it took forever for us to get our lattes and our dessert. I asked for the lemon tart and maybe 10 minutes later did he finally crack open the case to get it out. This place is not that busy for the service to be that slow.

The portions are small and the food is just not delicious. Stoneys which is down the street does brunch right. The service there is always incredible, you are greeted enthusiastically and you always leave full (and sometimes with leftovers!). 

The lattes in this place are delicious but that is it. And because of the bad food and service - its not enough to bring me back."}
{"text":"Beautiful food, great ambiance and coffee - had an awesome latte! Thank you! Can't wait to be back!"}
{"text":"Kerr street Cafe is a great spot to hit when in Oakville. Very cozy vibe and great to sit and gab or enjoy a nice coffee and sandwich. They also have all day breakfast items which is a very nice touch. Friendly service and a nice environment, what else do you really need?"}
{"text":"This place absolutely deserves all the praise it's been getting.

Went here on a jam-packed Labour Day weekend and right off the get go, I knew this place was handling the moshpit of eager customers in an efficient and friendly manner. They told us upfront that it was about a 20 minute wait and that the kitchen was about 30 minutes backed up but that didn't turn us off at all after seeing the satisfied diners. In fact, it was really nice that they were honest and, most importantly, accurate about the timing. We were seated well within the time frame the hostess had estimated and, even though there were two huge tables seated before us, we didn't have to wait a minute longer than half an hour (give or take). The kitchen staff are clearly superheroes.

All of the staff were friendly, but the highlight of this spot's hospitality was the manager's insistence that I receive a complimentary drink because of a small menu error (there is no gluten free option for the french toast, though it is listed as having one). That was mildly annoying, sure, but I had a back up order ready to go and wasn't too peeved. Anyway, when I said I didn't need a coffee because I was going to grab an almond milk cappuccino which is pricier (almond milk costs extra too), he still said I could get that for free! Who is this guy? Jeez louise, you're awesome.

The back-up option I had in mind for the GF french toast was the buddha bowl and I am straight up glad there was a mix up. These were fanflippintastic. Warm lentils served with shredded carrots and beets makes for a super healthy and yummy brunch option. I was somewhat disappointed at the lack of vegan/vegetarian options but honestly I didn't need many more options with this number. 

As for the ambience, it was a bit loud by virtue of the hoards of customers gobbling up brunch, but that's to be expected. The decor was fresh and arty, while maintaining a notable elegance.

Last thumbs up point, you pay up at the cash register before you enjoy your meal rather than waiting at the end for your waiter to personally ring you up. Brilliant way to save time and increase the efficiency of service!"}
{"text":"I like this cafe. It had a cool modern feel to it, but welcoming at the same time. I really like the different paintings on the wall, especially the one of the red rain boots. It's a nice place to grab a bite to eat, hangout with your friends, or study.

The service was good, servers were friendly. Our server made a great recommendation when asked about the different coffees.

I ordered the steak sandwich. This was yummy! I loved the melted cheese, the steak was tender, and I liked the caramelized onion jam. The dill sour cream balanced well against the sweetness of the jam. The bread was soft and crunchy, all the good things you look for in a sandwich. I also enjoyed the side salad, which was a pretty big portion size, and nicely dressed. 

For coffee I ordered the the flat white, which was not too strong of a coffee. It had a nice flavour to it. I don't really enjoy bitter coffee so I really enjoyed this one.

I'd come back here if I was in the area again. Next time I'd like to try some of their desserts."}
{"text":"This was my first visit, and it was excellent. I had a Buddha bowl and cappuccino, and I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast last weekend while waiting for my car to be serviced around the corner.. It's got a great ambiance and friendly wait staff. The coffees were great and our food was delicious. Truffle fries are the best!"}

{"text":"Very cute brunch place! Very downtown x hipster down to Earth cafe.  Food is great, service is wonderful and the ambiance is very chill."}
{"text":"A great place to start your day. A cute little cafe which serves super delicious egg florentine  on a corn bread. Their coffees are amazing."}
{"text":"My favourite local café by far! Whenever I tell my two kids we're going to Kerr Street Cafe, they can barely hold in their excitement! I like my coffee black, and this place does it right! My son prefers a lot of sugar in his coffee! haha i'll never understand that little 8 year old! Either way, me and my kids all love this place!"}
{"text":"Cute bright atmosphere to have a chat or do some work. Staff is very friendly. Food is a bit on the pricey side. I ordered the Ricotta pancakes and my friend ordered the French toast paired with a latte. Delicious food and drinks and beautifully prepared. I'd like to come back and try other things in their menu and their dark chocolate mocha."}
{"text":"Sorry, have to downgrade this place.  I got any way eggs (sunny side up) and a coffee and it was 9.60.  Don't mind the price. Coffee is still delicious.  However, eggs were way over-cooked and there was no yolk coming out of the eggs.  It was dry.  

Over-cooked eggs are my pet peeve and if it weren't for there amazing coffee, it'd be so getting 2/5."}
{"text":"Their coffee is excellent, and the food is delicious. I love coming here for breakfast: their Huevos is good and gluten-free, so is the granola which is served with a pot of yogurt and some fruit. Really nice staff put the cherry on top. It's a local hang out for people on lap tops as well, with free WIFI. I go all the time :)"}

{"text":"Wow wow wow!!I went here on a weekday brunch and this place actually had a Sunday brunch vibe going.This place was packed and that sure spoke volumes even before I got seated.

You walk in and in a minute or two you are seated.There are so many servers walking around order placing is another quick process.

So obviously knowing myself I love to order a variety of dishes especially if the place is this highly rated.I knew exactly what I wanted.

My order was a frenchie and smoked salmon and egg muffin.Both came out in timely manner and were absolutely delish.

The banana raspberry French toast was absolutely divine a little crisp on the outside and so moist and flavorful on the inside and the banana compote on the side was so delicious.Maybe next time I may just ask for a drizzle of maple syrup on it, I like my f-toast on the sweeter side.This dish is definitely a must when visiting this cafe.

My other order was a egg muffin with salmon.The english muffin was perfect toasted and the egg was cooked to perfection, with crispy edges.Salmon was generously used and was loaded with sweet and spicy red peppers and micro greens.

The place itself has such a big city vibe with outs of people brunching on a weekday.I'm glad I made it to this place and now it's definitely my favorite in Oakville.

There's plenty of street parking in the area.The decor is very modern and contemporary."}
{"text":"Kerr Street Cafe has just become one of my favourite brunch places anywhere. In addition to the amazing food, the interior is gorgeous, and everything screamed brunch about this place. The interior is classical, timeless, and clean. There's a ton of plants every where and the entire place feels organic. 

We came here for a weekend brunch and didn't have to wait too long as we came after the initial rush. We ordered the ricotta pancakes, and the eggs Florentine. The first you notice about the food is how clean everything looks and it tastes like that. There's a certain cleanliness to the food, it's light and it's devoid of excessive grease. There's a finesse to the food here and it's quality.

The pancakes were some of the most fluffiest I've had. The rosemary custard was creamy without being overly sweet and blueberry sauce was just the perfect tartness and sweetness! The edible flowers were a nice touch as well and added a further lightness to the dish. The eggs Florentine was absolutely perfect. The balance was done just right. The egg was perfectly runny yet firm. The main star was the jalapeno biscuit which added just the perfect amount of salt and butter taste. The citrus and the creaminess from the Hollandaise brings it all together. The greens were a nice touch and were nice and sweet! 

All this made for an extremely pleasant meal and one of my favourite brunch experiences. They are also into sustainable eating and dining which is awesome!"}
{"text":"We have made two visits here now and both times the food has been fantastic. They make great cafe lattes and cappuccinos, I believe the coffee they use may be exclusive to them as I tried to find it online with no luck. They recently expanded so there is a lot more seating now and the place is decorated beautifully; minimalist style. 
Today we shared the French toast, it was superb. They split it into two plates for us which is great customer service. It was hands down the best French toast I have ever had. From the bread, to the garnish it was perfection. 
The reason I have held back on a 5 star is a. The hours are awful, we are so lucky if we are able to make it here as they close early everyday and b. I am not a fan of the way the payment service is set up like a fast food restaurant. They have you sit down, figure out what you want then go up pay at the register and take a number to your table. I feel like if your prices are 12.00 and over on average you should get full service. It just seems like there was a lot of girls walking around with nothing to do. 
If you get the opportunity to stop in here you really should, I do not think any of their items will disappoint."}
{"text":"This place is very trendy and has a lot of potential growth...it's definitely going through growing pains and is very apparent during the weekend brunch hours. Customers walk in to a jam packed tiny cafe and are given no direction on wait time or the proper procedure for even becoming noticed or ordering. I needed to interrupt the barista, after 5 minutes of waiting, just to ask about a table. He said it would be a few minutes, but neglected to tell me that I needed to wait in another line just to order my food and coffee. What?! Found a table on my own after 20 minutes. Waited another 20 minutes for drinks, which were good but pricey. Coffee and chai were great. Watched as the minimal staff scurried around to all the disgruntled tables...tense! Finally got our meals after 75 minutes of arriving. My Benedict was incredibly small and had a two-bite piece of salmon with it. Not worth the extra $4 they charge. Food was overall delicious, clean-eating, and satisfying but all people in or party complained of small portions for the price and meals that were not quite as warm as they should be. It's one thing to wait for a table, but proper communication, service, and food is expected when a customer sits down. Felt like a free for all with no direction."}
{"text":"While this place has a great ambiance but the price and the quality of food can't be justified. The small portions and expensive coffees is not worth it in Oakville.  There several better places to eat that are better than this place, e.g. stoneys across the street."}
{"text":"Wow, I absolutely love it here! 

I'll keep it short and simple.  

Superbly smooth lattes 
Huge portions 
Great flavour combinations 
Open, spacious, and welcoming 
Ample seating
Lots of selection 
Warm and friendly staff (for the most part) 
Traditional brunch items available all day every day, not just weekend mornings 

I only have a couple of wishes: 

A bit more hollandaise sauce for the eggs florentine - it was a bit on the sparse side; but that's an easy fix - just ask for more. And also, though the jalapeño cornbread (as the base for the florentine) was to die for, by the time I got to my second egg it had become mushy from the hollandaise and yolk. I was unable to finish it which is a shame.  The eggs were a bit overcooked - the yolk didn't have much run left and was closer to fully cooked. 

We've been a few times and can't wait to work through the entire menu."}
{"text":"Creative menu and their coffee is amazing. Almond milk latte is my favourite. Been there a few times - not a single time disappointed."}
{"text":"We like coming here for Sunday family brunch. Food is great, my son loves the pancakes. Staff is also good but after visiting a few times I find that after 10am, when the morning rush kicks in, they tend to forget about you. Come in early."}
{"text":"Different atmosphere since expansion and renovations....not so cosy, slightly clinical and less conducive to intimate conversation.....lots of echo ! Food still good, coffee above average. If you don't want your muffin warmed you'd better tell them!"}
{"text":"When I lived in Australia I was fascinated and astonished by the energy they put into making their coffees. While there I actually became a barista and made hundreds of coffees a day. It is wonderful to see that Kerr Street Café employs that same commitment, enthusiasm and artistry that I experienced while abroad. To my knowledge, no other coffee place in Canada comes close. 

I come here as often as possible for the perfect mocha. In fact, it is so good that I cannot order a mocha from any other establishment because it simply cannot compare.

The foam here possesses that same silky texture I remember from Australia* and the milk is never burnt, never overheated. Not once have I heard the steamer wand shrieking from improper technique; a sign of well trained baristas. The espresso is robust but not bitter and a nice crema. The chocolate powder used in the mocha is exquisite, with a bold well-rounded flavour that is not too sugary.  

Other items of note: They do lovely foam art and also sell scones bought from Cob's such as banana and chocolate. 

*To clarify: I realize this place is owned by a Kiwi and not an Australian."}
{"text":"Great cafe to come grab a brunch meal. I opted for the Kerr street breakfast which satisfied me for sure, the flavours/seasonings as well as their plating was exquisite. My mother got a quiche and the dressing on the side salad was pretty damn good too! 

The coffee didn't quite hit the right spot for me, but the great service and atmosphere allowed me to forgive them a little for that. 

Maybe in the more expensive side of fares but worth the experience."}
{"text":"Brunch done right. We visited early on a Saturday morning (after reading about the usual lineups later in the morning, it's safer to go earlier) and we weren't disappointed at all - a wonderful spot for two, for families, for people of all ages. Spacious, contemporary, but with a really homey, comfortable feel. It's hipster meets suburbia meets family-style dining. Basically, no matter who you are with, it's a pleasant place for a meal. 

First, the parking situation. We ended up paying for street parking right in front of the restaurant, which is $1.50 per hour. If you choose to park here, you pay at the parking meter. Note that the parking meters only take quarters, loonies, and toonies (We put a nickel in and lost it :( ).

Second, the food. YUM. We ordered: a) French Toast ($13.00), b) drinks: a Latte ($4.00) and a teapot of looseleaf looseleaf Harvest Mint Tea ($3.00), and c) Eggs Florentine (poached eggs on spinach, sweet jalapeño and pepper cornbread, $13.00). The coffee was indeed very light, mildly sweet yet delicious, the French Toast was so incredibly soft and chewy with delicious flavours really seeped into the bread (this was my favourite). The Eggs Florentine could have been bigger, but really paired well with the cornbread and wilted spinach - it made you feel like you were having a lighter, semi-healthy breakfast. 

Third, the service. I guess they've updated their services recently, as you actually no longer need to order at the counter before finding yourself a table. On the Saturday morning we visited, there was indeed table service and we were seated right away.

Oakville is fortunate to have this spot in its vicinity - I'll definitely be back!

For two people, with tax, and tip, our total came to around $41.00."}
{"text":"Relaxed and calm atmosphere - even on Sunday mornings when all other brunch places are insane. 

Good if you have a group with some people wanting a full breakfast and others  wanting a scone or something else small. I combined a toasted bagel and sides (avocado, tomatoes, and potatoes)  to make a vegan breakfast. The food came out relatively quickly and was just what we wanted and expected - with the exception of them including the cream cheese on the side with my bagel despite me specifically asking for it without (strict vegans may want to be extra clear when ordering). Coffee was decent but nothing special. 

Really, the best thing about this place was the atmosphere and the service. Would definitely recommend and come here again :)"}
{"text":"Went to get coffee this morning and they had closed the shop for a private event.  Who closes a coffee shop in the morning for this?  At least seven other irritated customers were turned away while I was there.  One private event and dozens of ticked customers without their morning coffee"}
{"text":"Excellent is the best way to describe this place. Fantastic options for breakfast / brunch and as you can tell by the photo it's presented in such a beautiful way.

The staff are extremely friendly and helpful. They have it together!!!"}
{"text":"Very pleasant experience overall. 

If you go before nine, you avoid the rush hour and you can bring your little one without hesitation since the early morning hours are more suitable for children. 

After nine o'clock it gets very busy and a bit hectic although it still is an organized place. 

The staff is friendly and well informed. The menu is small which shows that they are serious about what they are serving. I don't trust restaurants with huge menus to prepare everything perfectly. 

I've pretty much tried everything on their menu and nothing had disappointed me so far. They have options for vegans and meat lovers as well as kids portions. 

The room is very cute and cozy. The coffees are just the way they should be. Side items are a bit overpriced but the total package seem to be worth it."}
{"text":"What the heck, I'll give this place 5*s 'cause I can't really think of anything \"wrong\".  NICE change of pace from the bustlin' Stoney's, up the street!

When I arrived, after lunch, it was nice 'n quiet.  After reading reviews about their lattés, I ordered one.  It's my \"usual\" anyway.  And even though I was full from lunch, I got the lone piece of key lime cheesecake 'cause it looked soo inviting + it was the day before my bday... ;)

Latté had a good, strong coffee taste.  And the cheesecake was re-plated/decorated for me.  The male barista working behind the counter was very kind.

My friend was really enjoying her tea and I asked her to ask for a refill of water.  And literally afterwards, the barista showed up and asked if she wanted a refill!!!  Really good service.

Note:  There are a coupla bistro tables outside."}
{"text":"The coconut French toast with blueberry campote... Oh man! That was super delicious. We also ordered parmesan truffle fries that definitely needed more truffle flavor, you could only take the parmesan. Very small menu.Otherwise super nice spot."}
{"text":"Amazing brunch for a long weekend. Eggs Benny with salmon was incredible - served on corn bread. Friend has French toast and couldn't stop talking about how good it was. Good coffees, friendly service, homey location. I will definitely be back for brunch or coffee with friends!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best coffee in Oakville. 
Charming atmosphere, brilliant décor. Friendly and personable staff as well! The brunch/ lunch menus are thoughtfully designed. Striking and delicious flavor pairings and an always stunning presentation."}
{"text":"Great Coffee! I enjoy their cappuccino, mocha and their chai as well. Their French toast is my go to, when I'm grabbing a bite. Very tasty and filling. It's a tad expensive. $17 for French toast, so it's a once in a while treat. Very busy on Saturdays, so I try to go earlier. They close at 4 daily, which is a bummer. Even 6pm closing would be better. 
All in all, one of my favourite Oakville spots!"}
{"text":"Used to be our fav cafe in Oakville up until about two/three weeks ago when they have changed their menu. Their portions are smaller and not as delicious as before, while the prices stayed the same. To be a good cafe you MUST have a delicious menu. Better increase the prices than screw up the menu!"}
{"text":"We decided to take a food road trip from Toronto and the Kerr Street Cafe was our chosen destination.  After a short wait, the staff texted us when our table was ready, we went into a clean, light, busy, but organized restaurant.  The staff were efficient, helpful and friendly.  

We ordered food off a small brunch menu.  I ordered the cauliflower rancheros which was fresh and full of flavour.  I also ordered a side of smoked trout which was delicious.

The food was at the higher price range for brunch, but the atmosphere and taste were worth it.  The meals were carefully prepared and presented.  I would certainly recommend this restaurant to anybody looking for a step up on the usual bacon and eggs fare."}
{"text":"Cozy coffee shop with one heck of a chef! Every breakfast we've had here has been amazing. (And PERFECT poached  egg)

It is a tad bit overpriced but not so much so that we don't pop back in from time to time."}
{"text":"What a great find.  For an old strip mall, I would have never guessed that is has such a bright and pretty place with some seriously good coffee coming out of it.  Call me surprised but also call me whenever you're going here cause I want to join in. 

Kerr Street is definitely the place for lunch.  When I walked in, I expected it to be empty but at least 20% of the table was already taken at 11 am. By noon, its was fairly full.   Looking at all the tables, I can see why... all of the plates looked very good and the cups of coffee coming out from the barista, love it.  This is the stuff I would expect from Toronto... not the suburbs.  

I just need to write about the coffee in one paragraph.  I love how they're using a local Oakville Roasters called Brothers.  I saw them at the Beanstock festival and had I known how good they were, I would have definitely tried their coffee (even though I was already heavily caffeinated).  The coffee was rich, robust, and very friendly... not too bitter and definitely had a chocolate note to it.  Highly drinkable and delicious.  The best part, the barista really knew what a flat white was ANNND the latte art was beautiful!  Yeah... I'm so happy for this that I'm rating the coffee before I even finish my usual review of service and place first. 5/5 for the suburbs (but it's really a 4.5/5 for Toronto but still absolutely love it).

The place is quite big as it takes up 2 stores from the looks of the ceiling.  You have a bar area where you can do take out and a large communal table.  Then you have the dining spot where most people sat.  It was well spaced out so it wasn't cramped and there was a lot of wonderful light.  It reminds me of a really nice curated picture of a white washed rustic but clearly upscale cottage.  Warm and homey.

Service here... is probably one of the weaker points but not because they're rude.  It's just incredibly relaxed and possibly unaware.  So if you're here for a quick lunch during the work day... maybe not the best.  But if you're to do a lazy day brunch or lunch with the girls, this would be a great spot.  We did have one young guy who was really good and attentive but he disappeared after 20 minutes and only the ladies took over the staffing.  They were kind... just not attentive.  

Ayurveda Bowl (vegan) - a great option for those who want a healthy brunch or lunch without just having a simple romaine caesar salad.  I liked how it has a variety of chopped vegetables that kept it interesting. Tender peas, cubed cucumber, diced tomatoes, fine pieces of red onions, and asparagus are all found in the bowl along side a light saffron rice and a curry tumeric dressing.  I found the dressing to be on the light side but it's a nice creamt texture.   4/5

Banana Raspberry French Toast -  WOW... ok.  you have my attention. 
 A large plate of 4 thick pieces of french toast landed on our table and it was just a sight.  The french toast was doubled up to sandwich rich sweet banana that are custard like.  The bread is a tender butter brioche that soaked up all the custard and the kitchen perfectly seared the sides to give it a crispy and caramelized edge.  The addition of the almond butter creme fraiche was delicious excess and reason to wipe the plate clean. Extra crispy banana pieces and sweet nutty pieces are just fun to scoop up with the French Toast.  I love how they used dehydrated raspberries to add a vivid red shade to the dish while adding a nice tart burst to each bite.  Definitely a top 5 French Toast in all of Toronto.  5/5

French Fries - Oh, these were claimed to be great by the staff.  Uh unfortunately not.  Though they were the prefect colour of the well done bronze, these were somehow limp, soft and soggy.  I was really disappointed as the entire bowl was like this.  I was hoping even one to be crunchy but nothing... we didnt even finish half the bowl and the staff didnt notice.  3/5

Flat White - What another surprise.  Not only was Brother Beans delicious, they have a barista that knows how to do good pours and really good flat white.  I think this might be the first time I've found in in GTA. My flat white had a great light topping of microfoam with the right balance of milk to espresso.  It was enough to allow the bold espresso flavour to be prominent but still allow the milk to mellow out any sharp edges.  From ordering the 2nd flat white (yea I liked it that much), I can safely say the beans is a nice robust rich flavour without any harsh acidity.  It's great to see a local good roasters in the GTA West.  I'll come back just for a cup.  4.5-5/5

Overall, this is a solid place for food and drinks ... there are some real highlights coming out of the barista and kitchen.  With some service and dish tweaking, this would be one of the best brunch spots I could recommend of out all GTA."}
{"text":"Solid food and great coffee. I didn't try anything else but otherwise, the butter tart and coffee I had was great."}
{"text":"This was my second time here and so far I've never been disappointed. This homey-style cafe can get busy on weekends and they don't take reservations, so it's better to go early or in smaller groups - otherwise be prepared to wait. I went here twice with my family for weekend brunch and the food is always so good. I think the cafe has been expanded too (I've heard it used to be a lot smaller but then they expanded into the location next door or something.) They have available a combination of traditional breakfast food and fusion-type food. There are lots of coffee options available that can be a bit overwhelming if you don't really know what you want, but the staff is helpful for choosing food and drinks if you need it. There's street parking available all along Kerr St, and there's also a parking lot around the corner from the cafe."}
{"text":"Our favourite place in oakville for breakfast. Steak sandwich and French toast are our favourites. Now with more seating. Great espresso too."}
{"text":"My day in Oakville kicked off at Kerr Street Cafe. 

On this nice sunny Tuesday, Kerr Street Cafe was surprisingly busy. Maybe all these people were enjoying the end of Summer just like us. 

Brunch is serves everyday here... good for people like us that works weekend. 

Cappuccino jump started my day, while I leisurely waiting for my Egg Benedict ($11.99) to arrive. It was good breakfast/brunch but when I told my Yelp Friend the price, he started rolling his eyes. Eggs were poached perfectly and the hollandaise sauce was tangy with a hint of lemon....

Checking in with my Yelp apps and uploading photos with their Free Wifi, just ask for the password... 

Every day of the week, one can have their brunch fix at Kerr Street Cafe without waiting for the weekends to come!"}
{"text":"Good cafe good service and nice barista!!!!!! ^ .^ 
Ice latte and capped are really good. Brownie is sweet and tasty.with  Yujie"}
{"text":"After steadfastly refusing to wait in the goat rope nonsense that is the Stoney's weekend brunch queue (my glowing reviews be damned), I walked over the infinitely more serene Kerr Street Cafe. We were easily able to get a table for two and successfully avoided the onset of Brunch Stress.[1]

As per 'la mode cafetorium', you order first and then take a seat. A mighty chalkboard announces the brunch options. It's a dare-I-say-it \"cute space.\" Pretty airy exercise in white and steel grey with a long counter full of prepared foods and baked nibbles, there are fresh flowers about, quirky greeting cards at the register and a surfboard above the drink fridge. I detect an antipodean presence here.

This was also evidenced by the flat white and long black on the espresso board. A long black is like an americano but with more water in the shot, rather than poured on top of the shot. Really tasty. The cuteness continues on the coffee menu with offerings like \"choc hotlet\" and (free) \"hugs from Mark.\" Next time maybe.

For brunch, I ordered the eggs Benedict with salmon and orange juice. The hollandaise was tangy, though the eggs ended up hard poached. NBD. I still prefered the benny to my bite of the Huevos Rancheros. Oh, and the salmon and eggs came on corn fritters which was a nice touch.

My only caveat would be that brunch was a bit expensive clocking in at almost $40 before tip. That's not insane, but you know: it's breakfast. I'd certainly stop here again for an espresso though.

Obligatory Title Pun: You'd be KERR-azy not to visit.

Menu Readability: Them chalkboards are HUGE. 

Need to mention: They close at 4pm which would be ridiculous anywhere but Oakville. (Rolls eyes, chortles haughtily.)

What this place teaches me about myself: My coffee prefs apparently hail from down under.

{"text":"This place has the best coffee in the oakville area. If you like a good cappuccino or latte this is the place to go. A bit on the expensive side for food but the quality is there too. Check hours before going there as they open late and close early by any coffee shop standards."}
{"text":"Great location and atmosphere in this small cafe. Good coffee, espresso and sandwiches...typically offer tasty daily special sandwiches and other fair."}
{"text":"I always come here mainly for the pancakes but decided to try the avocado toast as well this time. 

Ok, I must say, there were WAY TOO MANY sweet potatoes/squash on top I could barely taste the avocados!!! (And pomegranate which did not compliment the avo at ALL)
They only put super thin layer of the avo and threw a heavy load of squash so all you taste is the half cooked squash....and it's $15... $15 BUCKS GUYS COME ON!!!

Also asked for 2 eggs which they forgot. 
(Later Came on separate plate. Plane. No salt pepper nothing.) 

I love the atmosphere here and still love their pancake (they used to put edible flowers on top but not anymore) 
However, I think they need to rethink their menu and stop being so cheap with the ingredients despite the hefty price tag. You can't fool us!!!"}
{"text":"Other than the fact that the food came before the drinks even though the drinks were ordered as soon as we date down, I really liked this place. Speaking more about that though I really feel like our drinks should have been comped because we were almost halfway done our meals before our drinks arrived. Anyways, the food was delicious! I was hesitant to pay for avocado toast but actually it was the best avocado toast I've ever had! The service was nice and friendly. There was a bit of a wait but nothing too long so no issues there. Also the place is decorated in the cutest way possible with a very open space and botanical theme."}
