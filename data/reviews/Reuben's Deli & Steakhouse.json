{"text":"The steak is really good here and I have to come back once again before I finished my trip in Montreal."}
{"text":"Amazing food, great atmosphere, great service. Highly recommended. Price is higher but worth every penny."}
{"text":"I was at Reuben's in April after a long day walking around Montreal.  I had been told by friends how good the smoked meat was so I felt I had to try it.  I was dining alone, so I entered and asked for a table for one, in French.  Hey...I'm trying, here. The hostess took me to my table and plopped down an English menu.  So much for that.  My hopes and dreams of practicing my French, crushed to smithereens.    That said, my waiter was a really nice guy.  I ended up ordering a burger and fries, and dinner was terrific.  Ambiance was awesome, and by the way: Canadian ketchup is unbelievable!  I've got to buy a bottle next time.   So, I will be coming back to Montreal in July.  This time, I'm trying the smoked meat.  You'll know me when I come back, by my awful French. See you in a few months."}
{"text":"Came here during our trip in Montreal because of all the good reviews.  So glad we decided to go here to have a Montreal smoked meat sandwich.  My boyfriend and I decided to each get the original Reuben while splitting a salad and a poutine.  Hands down the best smoked meat sandwich I've ever had.  The service was fast and friends, the drinks were nothing special but obviously you're coming here for the food.  Nice atmosphere  too.  If you're looking for where to go to try smoked meat, this is the place!"}
{"text":"Whenever I go to Montreal I have to stop at Reuben's Deli and Steaks for their  Smoked Meat Poutine. Montreal is synonymous with poutine and smoked meat and this establishment's Smoked Meat Poutine combines the best of two worlds!  It is probably one of the best poutine's in the world and I am glad this place is is six hours away from me, otherwise I'd be as fat as a cow! This place is also generous with their portions as their appetizers can feed more than one person.  The overall decor is exquisitely classy as demonstrated through the wait staffs overall demeanor and outfit. It is a popular restaurant therefore I advise you to place reservations ahead of time so you won't have to wait a long time in line. This is especially important to do during the busy nights on Fridays and Saturdays.   Quick Tips 1. Try to place a reservation otherwise you're going to wait a long time  2. Try their Smoked Meat Poutine!   Conclusion: Anyone who is heading to Montreal should stop on by and try out their delicious food!"}
{"text":"Résumé : excellent service, d'énormes plats (à partager absolument à moins d'avoir une faim de loup), plutôt de la bonne nourriture du genre « diner » haut-de-gamme, si les plats sont partagés prix peu élevés mais dans la moyenne  sinon.  On est allé chez Reubens en fin d'après-midi pour un petit quatre heures. L'intérieur est spacieux, le tout recouvert en bois et cuir. Il était vide lorsqu'on y était (entre 17h et 18h) mais je soupçonne que le resto doit être assez bruyant une fois plein.  Le service est offert en anglais et en français et le serveur était à la fois attentif et agréable. Il ne venait pas nous harceler toutes les cinq minutes pour savoir si tout était à notre goût, mais il ne nous ignorait pas non plus. Très correct.  Nous avons pris un seul sandwich original avec frites pour deux, et ensuite une tranche gigantesque de carrot-cake, aussi partagée. Le tout était bon et nourrissant, pour un prix total de $23 plus pourboire. La carte contient une sélection de choix typiquement (ou peut-être steréotypiquement) montréalais comme de la viande fumée, le cheesecake, la poutine, etc. pour ceux qui cherchent un peu de culture canadienne.  Au final, très satisfaisant comme expérience."}
{"text":"This place is great! The food is so good, we go at least once each time we go to Montreal. Service I'd always outstanding.  Definitely would recommend to friends and coworkers."}
{"text":"I have been given a lot of shit from my foodie friends for going to Reuben's Deli all these years but I stand by my claim: Reuben's is just better than Schwartz's when it comes to smoked meat. Ok Ok. Point taken: you go to Schwartz's for the 'Montreal' experience but let me tell you honey, that place is so damn touristy now you couldn't find a real Montrealer in the crowd! They're all over at Reuben's getting a better sandwich in a MUCH better atmosphere.   If you're reading this review because you're coming to Montreal as a tourist I would recommend you go to Schwartz's AND Reuben's. That's right. I said it. BOTH. it's hard to choose but for me personally I'm team Reuben's all the way. Their sandwiches are really quite different: they're much more moist (Schwartz's are dry, quite dry and FATTY) and Reuben's comes with a HUGE plate of fries (which I love). I also highly recommend you get the onion rings to start with the Jack Daniel's BBQ sauce. They're unbelievably good. Like too good. I can only go to this place every 6 months because I leave so damn bloated! It's so filling! And don't be fooled by the huge menu they give you. There are like a million things to choose from but your eyes should go directly to the 'famous super sandwich' hidden at the top of one of the pages. They tempt you with other also-ran things like a 'chicken sandwich' or a 'hamburger'. UM. NO. Avoid. You should only get a smoked meat sandwich here folks. Really.   This place is located on Ste-Catherine aka the retail/strip club street in the heart of downtown. Most of you American tourists are probably very familiar with this street already, lol, but despite its middle-Canada feeling amidst the corporate flagship stores, Reuben's is where it's at for a legitimate Montreal dining experience. Trust me.  LOVE IT."}
{"text":"I had the The Reuben. Excellent meat and at a good price. The friendly staff were on point and the place was clean. French fries were frozen! Beautiful house made deli and some bagged shoestrings."}
{"text":"The service here is terrible. The food is average and overpriced. Definitely a tourist trap. I can't believe this place has such high ratings."}
{"text":"I go to Reuben's Deli especially for their excellent breakfast. They have this sautéed vegetable and smoked-meat breakfast with eggs and whole wheat bread  that is unrivaled in Montreal. Anybody who has been inside Reuben's know that the restaurant is very tastefully decorated and the seating space is ample and spacious.  While the breakfast options are not very expensive with very big portions, going to Reuben's for after work drinks or dinner can be a bit heavy on the pocket but this doesn't take away the quality of their excellent food and their huge selection of beers, wines, spirits and liquors.  One of my favorite breakfast/brunch places in Montreal."}
{"text":"Terrible! Our family of 6 were visiting from Toronto. Walked around downtown trying to find a place to eat. Settled here. Half way through our meal, I found a DEAD FLY in my salad!!!! Manager came over to speak to us. Gave us some bullshit speech about their produce being locally sourced and telling us they thoroughly wash their produce everyday (well, obviously not the case!)asked us what we wanted him to do. He said we didnt have to worry, he would take care of the meal, at no cost to us. We just wanted to get out of there really. When the bill came, they only deducted the salad and the entree it came with. We were still charged for 2 other entrees. What a disgusting way to treat your customers.  We will never return there again. Gross and they do not treat their customers well, all they care about is money."}
{"text":"Like Danny DeVito in Get Shorty, I wanted to order something off the menu.  So I asked the bartender (a great guy BTW) to modify their Jimmy the Greek salad by stacking it with a sliced grilled chicken breast.  When it arrives, it resembles Mount Vesuvius ready to blow!   I methodically worked that thing over for at least 30 minutes before the beast was conquered.  Parfait!"}
{"text":"Always a stellar meal at Ruebens. Been around forever and very generous portion size. There are two locations fairly close to each other but this one is much recommended. Cleaner, bigger and brighter.   Started with the smoked meat mac and cheese which was average. Chopped smoked meat on top of mac cheese. For some reason it was overly sweet which was a bit odd. For main we got the Rueben sandwich(of course...) very big size probably enough for 2 to share. Had this many times and do think it's a true standard for Ruebens. To finish off we got the giant carrot cake. Normal carrot cake but sight to behold sized. Worth it for the price.   Service and environment were friend, great place for a quick bite"}
{"text":"Most delicious smoked meat.  The meat is so tender that it melts in your mouth.  Our service Marco was excellent.  Attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"My husband and I had heard of Montreal smoked meat sandwiches. Please do not order. First the old fashioned drink was too sweet. The waiter did speak to the bartender and brought an extra whiskey shot to beef up the sweetness. That was very good. But the sandwich arrived and it was soft, tasteless , mustardless, cold and tasteless. The texture was mushy and awful. I don't recommend! We were in and out of Rubens in 45 minutes!"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere and staffs and on top of them, great food !! I had Big Bang Sandwich and Poutine. They were absolutely wonderful. They met quality and quantity at the same time."}
{"text":"First time at Reuben's Deli and it was absolutely delicious! The meat was, tender and melted in your mouth. The sandwich comes with a side of crispy fries and pickled slaw. The meat tasted better than schwartz and the portion size was larger - will be going back when back in town!"}
{"text":"we went for a late breakfast and were pleasantly surprised.  for a diner, its decor was very classy with lots of leather and dark woods.  our waiter was very friendly and helpful.  my wife ordered an omelette, and she didn't like the fact that there was too much vegetables in it.  the waitress was flexible and replaced the potatoes with some fruit.  i had the french toast/eggs/bacon with toast/bagel.  the scramble eggs was decent, and the french toast was delicious.  i especially like the sesame seed bagel that was well-toasted (no cream cheese?).  the meals were well-priced (less than $10), which also satisfied my pocket book.  we would return for breakfast/brunch any day!"}
{"text":"If you like hot meat, get it into your mouth at Reuben's. This place has the decorum of Bowser's castle and the food of a much jewisher ethnicity."}
{"text":"Food: BIG portions, always beautifully presented (within the achievable limits, I mean sandwiches are what they are...). The food taste good usually but nothing to be impressed about.  Service: Always fast, very attentive usually  Value: Overall very big portions, enough to feed two! Need to pay a spliting fee if sharing plate~  Ambiance: American retro-diner style, upscaled casual? Tables are well spaced between them, kudos for intimacy! Can be a little bit louder at dinner time but still pleasant, for sure you do not need to scream to hear each other talking~"}
{"text":"This is the first place the wife and I went to after arriving in Montreal. She had researched it first and boy am I glad she did.   We ordered a couple of entrees, but it was the appetizer that blew our minds. Smoked meat poutine. Let me say that again. SMOKED MEAT POUTINE!!!  A classic poutine covered with smoked meat. It was juicy, succulent...delicious.   I will never forget this dish as long as I live. If you like fries and smoked meat, and honestly how can you not, this is for you."}
{"text":"While in Montreal for a holiday my friend suggested I try the famous Montreal smoked meat sandwich. Reuben's isn't anything fancy but my sandwich was amazing. Honestly, I've never seen that much meat piled into a sandwich before. I only made it through half of it and saved the other half for a little midnight snack.   The service was great and our server was very friendly and helpful. Seemed like a great happy hour kind of place as well."}
{"text":"Average food. Average service. You get what you pay for. Don't come here if you're expecting fine dining"}
{"text":"Here is my review for the Reuben's at 1116 Rue Sainte-Catherine Ouest. They are 2 places with the same name on the same street (never understood why). I think some people are confused and don't put reviews at the right place. Good reviews should go to : Reuben's Deli & Steaks   ---  This restaurant is one of my favourite. Portions are huge indeed. For me, this place is about excellent food, comfort and good service. The food is always top quality. Never got something cold. Burgers are good for an economic lunch (15$) while you can have something more fancy (a streak) for more (40$).   This restaurant is always full, now, you know why !!"}
{"text":"Awesome!  If you are ever in Montreal, you MUST try their smoked meat sandwich.  It's a toss between a corned beef and beef pastrami.  Very tender, melt in your mouth good...portion size is huge.  Well worth it!  This will be my first stop when I make it back to Montreal.  The people were very nice and the service was excellent."}
{"text":"Great place if you like sliced meat sandwiches, steaks, etc. The restaurant is nicer than the deli."}
{"text":"Skip Shwartz's. Reuben's is my Montreal staple for comically huge, absolutely delicious quality sandwiches in a classic environment. LOVE IT"}
{"text":"The food was decent. It's the Cheesecake Factory of Montreal. Fries in the poutine were nothing special. Our waiter was extremely rude. He rushed us with the check and once we paid he told us he really needed the table even though we were still finishing our beers.  The experience was less to be desired and would probably never go back."}
{"text":"Simply one of the best in Montreal ~ top marks for my Atmosphere, Service, Food troika  Please note the location.  This review is for the Peel / St. Catherine's location (there is another branch just down the street approximately on McGill College / St. Catherine's).   Atmosphere: The place is warm, cosy, and bustling.  It usually full of people, from young couples, to business men on their lunch hour, to families and group gatherings.  You'll love eating at Rubens, simply because the most enduring testament to it's quality is it's busy dinning room.  Wood covered walls, and wine on display, leather booths, and polished wood tables all make for a comfortable dining experience.  Service: This is perhaps one of the most distinguishing attributes of Ruben's Deli.  The staff is incredibly (incredibly) professional! Having become an at-least-once-a-month-type-regular to Ruben's, I have still to have a bad experience.  The staff know their trade, and do it very well.  Top notch personalities, engaging, and charming - they know the menu and are always ready to make suggestions and accommodations.  It is also a great sign that the staff does not turn over very often, and so expect to see familiar faces if you start coming often.  Food: You go to Ruben's to EAT!  Indeed, the food is a little on the heavy side in the sense that it centre's on steak's, smoked meats, and burgers - but if you must indulge, do so here.  Ruben's offerings satiate hunger and please the eye in a double-whammy that would leave many other restaurants wanting.  The menu also has delicious salad choices, pasta dishes, and the aforementioned burgers (a MUST try is the bierhoff burger witch is toped with a ketchup / beer sauce and / or the Black Jack with comes with caramelized onions and Jack Daniels sauce.)  A full bar is at hand and for desert loves (here's lookin' at you ladies) you will absolutely squirm in your seats for Ruben's carrot cheese cake, their blue berry cheese cake, or their hot fudge brownie with walnuts and the biggest heap of vanilla ice cream this side of the boarder.  a Montreal classic  Eat'n Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Let me just start this off by I HATE SMOKED MEAT! BUT... I LOVE REUBEN'S SMOKED MEAT! It was tender and flavorful, to die for. The sandwiches are huge and the fries are crisp and delicious. My whole family was very satisfied with our meals. I've had the poutine on other occasions (When Belle Pro was just too far away to walk in the cold) which was pretty good also.  Our service was kind and friendly. My boyfriend, who it was his first time up to montreal, was treated well. They engaged him in discussions of what to see and even gave him a mini tourist book. It was very sweet and he enjoyed it.  I cannot say whether this was directly due to the meal, but I got very sick about an hour after eating. I was the only one of the party who got sick. Despite this, I'd go back again."}
{"text":"Best steakhouse. Best meat and amazing service. If you are a steak lover, the Sullivan with chiraz sauce is exquisite. A must if you are in downtown montreal!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this place.  Service was terrific.  Food was excellent.  Had the  poutine with smoked meat on top.   Can't compare to other smoked meat places but it tasted great.   Big menu offered lots of dinner choices.  Big dinner servings prevented us from ordering dessert.   I'd definitely go back again.   Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Simply beautiful! The food is made with care and talent, I have to say that. Tasteful, clean, perfectly seasoned, and very good service! I enjoyed the smoked meat, one of the best I have ever tried. The sweets are also good, I was surprised by a well-made cheesecake! I met my BF over there, so the 5 stars are going for the good karma of the place too! :)))))))"}
{"text":"Very good but don't eat anything in the previous 3 hours cause even their regular sandwich worth like two!"}
{"text":"The  Famous Super Smoked Meat Sandwich - this place's signature sandwich - was today the worst deli sandwich I have ever had!!!  This place, once very very good, has gone drastically downhill in just the last year.  Tasteless grocery story type imitation deli bread, wet greasy meat, in a sandwich that fell apart when I picked it up.  Stacked high on the edge of the plate to disguise the fact that this $18 sandwich was quite tiny. NOTHING LIKE THE LARGE, SUPERBLY PREPARED SANDWICHES ON HIGH QUALITY BREAD I HAVE EXPERIENCED AT THIS PLACE SINCE 2002!!!  This place was still pretty good in 2014.  NOW HORRIBLE - AND TO BE AVOIDED.  Disappointing - and sad. The nice Jewish family in the booth across from me also completely agreed.  My waitress could not have cared less, however."}
{"text":"This place is in a generally busy area, but me and a few friends walked in and were seated right away. Though the place may seem a little crowded, the atmosphere is nice and the great food and friendly service makes it worth it. I ordered a BLT, which I assumed was going to be a basic sandwich, yet it was absolutely delicious and decently sized. I would definitely recommend this place !!!"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere with yummy roast beef sandwich. Had dinner in late October with a nice experience. The portion is enough for two meals."}
{"text":"Smoked meat is famous in Montreal.  So there are a lot of places that serve smoked meat throughout the city.  One of the more famous places is Reubens.  The place is usually busy, especially during lunch time on the weekdays.    So when I am craving a smoked meat sandwich I tend to come here since its good and close to where I live.  You can order your smoked meat sandwich either lean, medium, or fat.  I usually get a medium with swiss cheese.  They give you tons of meat that is so delicious and juicy.  It definitely will fill you up for sure.    When I want a little protein after a gym workout I get the grilled chicken.  They served two tender chicken breasts with grilled vegetables and a side of rice.  Very good.  Although not necessarily the most famous smoked meat place in Montreal, when coming to Montreal, definitely make Reubens one of your stops for smoked meat."}
{"text":"Went to Reuben's for lunch on recommendation of front desk staff at hotel we are staying at.  Very friendly staff greeted us.  We were seated quickly.  Ordered Southern Crisp chicken salad and the Super Smoked Meat sandwich.  Very large portions came.  Both were delish.  The smoked meat here is soft, tender and tasty.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Really really good spot to eat and dine at in downtown Montreal. Service is excellent and the food is outstanding."}
{"text":"I've been forced to come to this place 3 times with different people. The service was just terrible every single time.  Their Reuben sandwich is good but not amazing. Everything else is plain including the The steak and cakes.  Their smoked meat is worse than Schwartz's -and Schwartz's smoked meat isn't even that good after the place switched hands-  This place is a tourist trap with bad service and overpriced deli quality food."}
{"text":"Amazing hamburger BBB! Good staff, big portions and the highest quality"}
{"text":"We were in town from Austin TX and discovered this place, we ended up eating here 3 times.  The menu is varied and the food excellent!  Soon as I got home went to the local grocery store for some pastrami aka smoked meat. :)"}
{"text":"Had dinner late at night.  We started with chopped poutine, skinny french fries drenched in gravy, sprinkled with cheese curds and blanketed with chopped beef.  Addictively tasty, and felt guilty about fat and sodium content with each bite, but worth it!  Hubby had the super sandwich - 10 ounces of more beef piled between two slices of white bread and mustard.  This was served with more fries, a vinegary cabbage slaw and a pickle spear.  Hubby could only eat half.  I had the jambalaya pasta, although I originally wanted the spicy deli penne which they were out of, and most of that made it into the to go box as I was stuffed after the poutine.  Only had water to wash down all the salt!  Service was very timely, our waitress was very friendly but the music was too upbeat and loud (almost felt like we were in a club).   In all, spent about 60 dollars (includes tip)."}
{"text":"good food for what it is. very popular with tourists but quality of food is very good. smoked meat sandwich, Reuben and French dip were all good. onion rings perfectly cooked. service is quick and professional. Ate here twice and would recommend."}
{"text":"Had the Super sandwich, 10 oz ,was pretty good, came with a lot of fries.  Poutine was pretty good too.  Beers were cold.  Good service, quick and courteous, will return to try dessert.  Busy and Loud, only had a 10 minute wait to be seated on a Friday night.  Seems well run."}
{"text":"The food was good and came in large portions, but is quite expensive for what you get. The sandwiches on their own are big, but the majority of your plate ends up being a pile of fries.  Although the restauarant was busy, it is quite large so there was no wait for a table. Our waiter was poor, only came by the table when necessary and did not offer refills or dessert. He seemed uninterested in his job altogether, which is probably quite common at spots with heavy tourist traffic. If you are in the area it is a decent option, but I would not recommend a special trip just for this restaurant."}
{"text":"One of the best smooked meet sandwiches I have ever had. I would like to request to have it opened in Toronto one day."}
{"text":"Good but I've had better at Katz deli in NYC! Atmosphere seems like a touristy place to eat. Prices weren't too bad and you get a lot for the price."}
{"text":"Always a great experience at Reuben's. Ordered their steaks several times and it was always done perfectly to my liking. The poutines and other sides are also really good. Not a big fan of their desserts though. But the overall meal, ambiance and service are always perfect"}
{"text":"I like this place... There are only a few good Deli's left in Montreal, including Famous (please don't change), Schwartz (evidently) and Reuben's. Reuben's has refreshed its look a few years ago, but unlike Rapido (RIP), which attempted the same, has kept the spirit of a deli together. It's' OK to change and refresh, just rotting away like Ben's did is just sad."}
{"text":"Ah Reuben's  how much do I love your breakfasts!  The answer is MORE THAN ANY OTHER RESTAURANT DOWNTOWN!! The sampler breakfast!   What can I say?  Eggs, sausage, bacon, ham, potatoes, pancakes, fruit and rye toast!  Coffee included at 9.99.   Wonderful food, excellent portion sizes in an elegant but fun environment.  Who wouldn't love that?? We can't wait to go back for more!!"}
{"text":"Recommended from the concierge at the Sheraton. Smoked meat sliders were amazing! Mac n cheese with pastrami on top was also amazing. My wife had \"chop chop\" poutine and loved it. The flat bread pizza my son had was delicious.  I loved the place.  Highly recommend it if you like smoked meats.  Better than any NY deli I've ever been too."}
{"text":"Portions are huge, plenty of choices, somewhat loud. I had the french dip and although the au jus sauce was pretty salty, it hit the spot.  The salad are also great, although you don't get fried :)  Service was quick and easy, good spot for lunch."}
{"text":"Great experience here today.  Ordered the Reuben and for some reason it was taking forever at 11:15am.  One of the managers came out and comped everything for me.  Being a non-French speaking Anglo, not something that you normally expect.  Definitely a classy move.  The smoked meat is really good.  It's not like a corned beef or pastrami that I'd find at a Zingerman's in Ann Arbor, or the Star Deli in Southfield, but it's really tasty.  They had some good beers on tap, and I had a fantastic dessert off of their dessert menu.    I'm still a fan of Corned Beef from some of the great delis in the USA, but if you're in Montreal, this place is definitely worth a visit to see what MTL smoked brisket is all about."}
{"text":"Does not even deserve one star. Absolutely rediculous place. Go there for dessert tonight because we heard they have amazing dessert! We order a beer, and the waiter tells us he can't serve beer since we are only having dessert.. Ok then. That's okay. So then he intentionally ignores us while we just want to order cheesecake!! So finally he comes back, and we ask for it to go. He says okay then leaves. THEN another lady comes up to us telling us that we aren't allowed to sit in the booth we are in because it's for real customers and have to go stand at the door until they get us our dessert. There were so many booths open, so many! Needless to say, they do not deserve people's money. They have zero customer service."}
{"text":"I really enjoy this traditional Montreal deli.  I love their smoked meat and fast service. They have all the traditional fare and the place feels like a throw back to an earlier time.  Recommended!"}
{"text":"The Famous Super Sandwich was amazing!  The brisket was so tender and delicious.  Good fries and I really enjoyed the light non mayonnaise type of Cole slaw.  Had I  known the chicken noodle soup was so great I would have ordered a bowl instead of a cup.  Top it all off with a nice cold Canadien draft and we had a very enjoyable lunch."}
{"text":"Their chocolate cake is to die for! The cheesecake is over rated though. I guess I'm not open minded enough."}
{"text":"Décevant, Pizza plus qu'ordinaire et smoked meat sec et servi avec des frites surgelé. Dîner pour 2 pers. (pizza + somked meat + 2 bières  = 53$) avant service Mais le service était bien."}
{"text":"Food - All the food was delicious and served to perfection - They were all served at the same time and hot  Service - No issues with the service - Friendly staff and helpful with the menus  Atmosphere - Lunch is not too busy"}
{"text":"WOW , I am never disappointed here.IF YOU WANT AMAZING SMOKEMEAT , A GREAT EXPERIENCE AND A FAST AND EFFICIENT MEAL -show up at Reuben's.  Same owner as Deville --pretty similar experience in another type of restaurant.  Good was incredible , I have always took the Big Bang for the last 5 years at this place. Let me tell you that my experience and it's taste has never truly changed. In fact , I think Reuben's has a very underrated smokemeat as compared to other houses in Montreal, I would easily rate it 9/10. The meat was soft and cooked so well that I felt like everything melt in my mouth. Honestly , according to my opinion , the smokemeat is better than the famous Schwartz in Montreal , which I believe is just overrated based on the historical factor. The fries are similar to Deville as they are given in a sharp and thin size seasoned with salt perfect. The salad that came with my plate was juicy --not super great but I liked it so much I still finished it ! Pickles is special --sweet and sour.  I can't say too much about the club sandwich that my date took. I had a bite and I can easily tell that it was made out of quality chicken and bacon. The plate is around 15$ and let me be honest , pretty much anyone would be filled up after such a plate. Just a heads up , you will be scared as how big the plate actually is.  Service : waiter was fast and efficient . Requested him for two or three of my demands and he served me in no time . Note that we came here around 11pm during the weekend after a hockey game --restaurant was still 3/4 packed , and yet, I did get served properly and I am satisfied . Again, like I said, expect the same level of quality in service as compared to Deville--the owners have done a great job with this restaurant and this is one of the reasons why this place is so popular amongst local and tourists! Last thing , note that your plates will arrive fast, as their team are always prepare and I believe that some stuff are pre-cooked a couple hours before as we have gotten our plates within less than 10 mins."}
{"text":"Poutine is great. Definitely try the Reuben sandwich it's a treat. However, the Carrot Cake is the BEST I've ever had. It is truly amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Bon, très copieux, bonne ambiance, service super sympa !"}
{"text":"Very disappointing.  A place called Reubens should at least make a great Reuben sandwhich.  Unfortunately the meat had little flavour, and it was 80% bread and 20% sandwich.  The beer burger was also disappointing.  Poorly seasoned and too much bub for the burger.  Service was frustrating.  Waiter was trying to hard with a song and dance and rushing us to decide on our orders. Appetizers ended up arriving with the main course.  I would not recommend or return."}
{"text":"Be aware!! Most reviews for the other restaurant, Reuben's Restaurent Delicatesseen, were meant for Reuben's Deli at 1116 Rue Saint-Catherine. I assume these two restaurants are owned by the same family where that on 888 Rue Saint-Catherine caters  more expensive food, with more traditional steak and barbecued meat.  Not that of less quality but if you fancy smoked meat with all derivatives then this is the right place.   We ordered a small Poutine with cheese. This was a huge and a fulfilling meal. The Double smokers meat with rye bread and mustard was so large and tasty. I asked for Frank's  Red Hot and the friendly waiter brought me jalapeño (red) so I can enjoy the food. We ordered another barbecued sandwich which took longer to prepare but the waiter offered for us free refill of drinks. I would say the most distinctive feature of this place is the service. Well done. As for the furniture and decoration, it needs a refresher as the place despite  its jazzy entrance need a complete new carpet and sets of chairs.  I liked the place and would definitely visit again."}
{"text":"Easy to see why it's called the super sandwich. The ambience here is very nice and loved the service. They offer a lot of other options too but... Anyways, the super was medium fat and it felt like melty heaven in my mouth. Would love to come back here some day"}
{"text":"It's not the best decor but the smoked meat an Reuben sandwiches were big and tasty!    Can't say I loved their famous carrot cake. It was a bit dry and there wasn't enough icing (my personal preference).   Still a highly recommend but stick to what one should traditionally order in a deli and don't veer to far away."}
{"text":"Came in for a coffee. The coffee machines coffee is not to par with the rest of the dishes. Need a real coffee machine  My  Americano coffee was fine but my partner latte was very weak."}
{"text":"In the states we tend to think of deli as a New York City institution but Montreal has its own tradtion. Reuben's has been around for years and if you are in Montreal it is well worth a visit. They have their own version of poutine but following my cardiologist's orders I have not tried that. You can order anything off Reuben's menu and you won't go wrong."}
{"text":"Their Seared ahi tuna salad  is the best mmm. It melts in your mouth."}
{"text":"Sandwiches were great, dessert cheesecake mediocre. Service was so-so, and it was very noisy inside. Nevertheless for a smoked meat sandwich this is a safe choice.  There is another Reuben's a few units away, it's in the basement. I'm not sure if it is the same owners or not, but that Reubens also has good sandwiches. It's quieter, old school, and less chic as this location."}
{"text":"$3 for a glass of pop with no refills!?  I don't care how good the sandwiches are, but this place is more along the lines of a Red Robin and not Morton's Steakhouse.  Their signature smoked meat sandwich was good but tasted like it was extra injected for higher yields."}
{"text":"This is my first trip to Montreal in years and I was told a few times to try this place. We came early and had breakfast which I can say did not disappoint. I had to have the smoked meat omelet which was absolutely delicious. My Mrs had the breakfast sandwich which was also very tasty with only complaint is it was huge. Food portions are very generous so only come with a big appetite. Great tasting coffee too....  We will be back for lunch before this trip is over."}
{"text":"Woah woah woah!   Ruben is my favorite sandwich... so I've probably had over 100 of them from various locations. Or so I thought. Until I put this foreign sandwich between my lips.   That. That my friends. Is the taste of perfectly toasted rye bread holding together a stack of smoked meat of highest quality, drizzled with their special sauce and crunchy sauerkraut.   There has never nor will there ever be a Ruben like this.   Key points: reasonably priced, service was attentive and polite, gets fairly busy but food was quickly delivered. They have cheesecake slices the height of a small monkey.    This is a MUST have while visiting. Must have Rueben!"}
{"text":"Pas fan. L'endroit est beau et atypique, une belle ambiance du style \"dinner\". La nourriture et le service c'est une autre histoire;J'ai commandé une salade grecque qui avait l'air très attirante sur le menu, mais qui s'est avérée être juste des gros morceaux de romaine, des gros morceaux de concombre, 3 tomates cerise, 2 morceaux de poivron , de gros morceaux d'oignons crus......rien d'extraordinaire et en plus très difficile à manger. La salade coûte 18$ , un prix vraiment élevé pour le peu de travail et d'imagination mis dans cette salade.  Mon ami a pris lui un hamburger, et il était très bon. Le service était moyen, nous avons pris une bouteille de vin et du coup n'avons pas eu d'eau et de plus le serveur a oublié notre entrée. Nous avons fait part au manageur de notre déception, il s'est excusé, mais aucun geste commercial. Donc nous avons dépensé 100$ pour 2 pour de la salade verte, un burger, des oignons ring, et une bouteille de vin (la moins chère je precise). L'endroit est super et bien placé, mais c'est vraiment décevant et plutôt cher."}
{"text":"So touristy... The ahi tuna salad was amazing. They changed waiters because apparently they thought me and my little sister did not have money and were scared about getting a tip. So we were not waited on the whole time till the end. When I went up to the manager and said can I please have the check and boxes and had cold tea for like 15 minutes :(. Our waiter was chit chatting with these tourists behind us trying to get a bigger tip from them and probably felt stupid so he gave us a new waiter without saying so. The new waiter when I asked said he ended his shift... lmfao canadians must really think we are stupid oh well. So he got a free 15% tip for nothing. Needless to say we like to spend money but not for people and businesses that do not deserve our dollars. The meat here is decent quality along with half of montreal. There tuna fish sandwich was big and yummy although there hot tea is lipton... lol  I know better places in the states no mint tea with green tea just one or the other. A scarce variety for having a wide assortment of desserts. Meant for the american fatties to just have regular tea or coffee and a lot of meat and fatty desserts. I would rather eat a steak but hey my opinion. Will not repeat. Do not like me or my sister"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service! Huge portions and excellent dessert! We ordered the super sandwich and had the el paradiso chocolate cake!"}
{"text":"Le meilleur smoked meat à Montréal à mon avis. Mais surtout j'adore le spaghetti avec smoked meat, c'est cochon, c'est délinquant, ça dit bien fort « aujourd'hui, je pense à mon plaisir et laissez-moi tranquille avec les calories et la bouffe santé », bref, en plein ce que ça prend de temps à autre ! (Chaque fois que je mangeais ça devant mon ancien patron, il était sidéré de voir que je pouvais finir ce plat tout en gardant une taille normale, LOL!)  Essayez aussi la poutine au smoked meat, elle est délicieuse. À prendre avec une bonne bière !"}
{"text":"4.5/5 - It's not Schwartz, and that's really the only gripe as the sandwiches are otherwise fantastic. On the plus side, it's way bigger and can actually accommodate a group of 4+. The decor and atmosphere are also of a classier calibre. Service was awesome. Go to Schwartz for lunch and Reubens for dinner."}
{"text":"We are here off recommendation from our concierge and we very disappointed. The Rueben sandwich everyone raved so much much about tastes like a glorified hotdog. Save yourself 16.50 and go to Costco. The tuna steak salad had very fresh greens and was giant but needs a different dressing. As of right now it's just being served with a soy sauce/sesame seed mixture that is too salty and too bitter for this salad. The chocolate cake was the bright spot of our meal though. So moist!"}
{"text":"We recently visited Montreal from the SF Bay Area.  There was some street work being done near the restaurant and could not proceed on the sidewalk. We were hungry and took a look at the menu and decided to have lunch.  Being fussy foodies we were struck with professional execution of the restaurant's ambience and staff conduct from the time we were greeted, seated, served, and exited.  This one of the most memorable eating experiences we've had in our travels.   Bravo.  This is now one of our gold standard.  Oh the food was excellent , makes us want to come back just to try other dishes.  Thank you."}
{"text":"yes to fatty smoked meat yes to pickle yes to coleslaw yes to pepper skip the fries skip the french onion soup  they have a counter like a diner and pie cooler like a diner and bar seats that rotate like a diner  it's a diner  they have jello on the menu"}
{"text":"The honey crunch chicken strips were the best chicken strips I've ever eaten in my life.  I haven't eaten anything that's disappointed me at this restaurant yet in the least."}
{"text":"Great service , great food. I ordered the reuban and reuban melt. Reuban was def better. What else can I say ?"}
{"text":"Expensive compared to some of the other smoked meat joints but the meat is good, the place is clean and the staff is attentive."}
{"text":"Tasty poutine .. Loved their smoked beef always busy which is always a good sign .. Lovely atmosphere and friendly staff.. Would definitely come back again! But maybe on a less busy day of the year!   Tip.. Try their Caesar salad it's fresh and full of flavours!"}
{"text":"Late lunch on a Weds so immediate seating. Corner seat was nice!  7oz sandwich on brioche was better than 10 oz \"famous\" sandwich on rye.  The meat was more moist and the bun wasn't dry.  The smoked meat is seasoned just right and has the right amount of fat:meat ratio!  Upgrade your fries to poutine and you obv won't regret it!    Service was fast and friendly!"}
{"text":"The smoke meat sandwich was pretty good. But the server forgot my order so had to wait a while. The famous cheesecake was mediocre. I would go to other pattiserie for dessert."}
{"text":"This is a spacious restaurant located downtown and the food that we ordered are pretty good. A little pricy, ranging from $18 nd up. However, the plates are big enough to share with 2 little kids, which is what I did with the Bolognese spaghetti topped with smoked meat. My husband ordered the smoked meat sandwich which was tasty. The best part is that you can request how much fat you want on the meat."}
{"text":"After getting through a delayed red-eye flight which caused me to miss my connecting flight and made the airline to lose my luggage, I looked to Reuben's to put a smile on my face and they succeeded.  We came in at 12:30pm and ran into the busy lunch crowd but were seated within 10 minutes. We started with Old Fashioned Chopped Liver which was very nice, especially with the crispy onions. My wife went with the Southern Crisp Chicken Tender Salad which we felt was a bit too sweet. I don't mind a BBQ ranch dressing, but this one was missing a flavour note. Maybe not enough acid. It was OK, but we were hoping for better. I went with the Original Reuben Sandwich with poutine and a side of coleslaw. The smoked meat was tender and juicy, the bread was crispy, and the melted cheese was gooey! And the coleslaw was tangy and crunchy! Yes, the sandwich was yummo!  Even though it was busy, our server, Pascale, was super friendly (and funny) and was always attentive.  This is not my first time at Reuben's. I go there whenever I make it to Montreal and have had their sandwiches, steaks, desserts, etc. Normally, I'd give Reuben's 5-stars (and I will for this review anyway), but for this one visit I would give it 4-stars only because the salad wasn't as good as their other food."}
{"text":"Edit: Why would there be 2 restaurants on the same street with the same name.   Original: Food was good and fair prices. Cheesecake was massive, we were 2 people and could not finish it! Would go back again however I disliked the fact it was below ground, felt like a dungeon."}
{"text":"This is a very popular spot but the wait time was fair. Service is good. The tables are very close. The food was excellent. This is the place for smoked meat sandwiches. The Reuben was good, but a little dry. My husband's jambalaya was excellent. Their specialty is a smoked meat sandwich with a two inch stack of meat. Be hungry!"}
{"text":"It's a nice diner-place.  We were seated with only a short wait at 2 PM on a Wednesday.  We ordered a Reuben to share, and some side dishes.  Unfortunately, our waitress gave us a plain smoked meat sandwich rather than a Reuben.  She also neglected to mention that the sandwich already comes with cole slaw, when I ordered a cole slaw side dish.  Two strikes, I'm afraid.  The smoked meat is good.  I suggest the platter rather than the sandwich - the floppy rye bread and bright yellow mustard do nothing to enhance the meat, which tastes better on its own.  The coleslaw is very vinegary and not mayo-y.  The sweet pimentos are very vinegary as well.  I would happily come back and sample more - the desserts look mighty good."}
{"text":"Fantastic smoked meat and great atmosphere. Diverse menu if smoked meat isn't your thing.  The service is always solid and the servers are quite friendly. Reuben's also packs orders to go as well!"}
{"text":"Had the special reuben sandwich with fries with the medium meat which is delicious and as a dessert i had a sunday which is so delicious and completes your meal so great. Its fantastic quick place to go !!!"}
{"text":"My kind of place.  Simple menu.  Attentive and friendly service.  Good serving sizes.  Cheesecake was great.  No bells and whistles, but that's fine with me.  Just do the thing you do and do it well - I'll be back."}
{"text":"Food was very good though be careful with what you order and pay for.  We ordered a burger and chicken sandwich which my husband and I split.  We enjoyed both.  Both came with fries, when I asked if I could get a salad substitution the waiter replied yes.  They brought a salad for me ahead of time and then one with dinner.  When we received the bill we were charged $10 for a extra salad and $5 extra to replace the fries.  When we told the waiter he seemed annoyed and bothered.  He brought over the manager and the manager treated us as if he didn't believe us and we did something wrong.  I was so uncomfortable and became annoyed as to how they made us feel."}
{"text":"Wife and I went here for our 20th anniversary.  Waiter was awesome, I originally ordered the fish n chips and wife ordered a salad. After I ordered the table next to us received their meal and I saw the awesome brisket sandwich. I went up and grabbed our waiter and told him I want that. He said \"good choice\" it was unbelivebly tender and full of flavor. I highly recommend it. Wifes salad was ok, they had no blue cheese. French onion was ok but nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"Looking for an early breakfast place and needed to have some smoked meat before i left Montreal.  Perfect combo of eggs with smoked meat, rye, home fries and fruit. Very tasty and reasonable!"}
{"text":"Great deli food, excellent service.  As a bonus they had an interesting cocktail menu worth exploring."}
{"text":"Amazing service, beautifully furnished, and affordable for a dinner out for two.  But...  I'd never had smoked meat and thought it was going to be all of my dreams come true. I was expecting something like pastrami or roast beef, but more flavorful. What we got - both on the house special poutine and the signature sandwich - was lukewarm, slimy, fatty, and completely devoid of texture.  I cannot honestly say that I enjoyed my meal. But perhaps smoked meat isn't for me."}
{"text":"70's deli diner facade, earth toned contemporary interior with eye catching murals.  Chop Chop Poutine is a meal in itself; tasty gravy and cheese curds so fresh they squeak on your teeth.  Smoked meat sandwich: fresh bread, tender moist meat, big enough to feed two.  Tip: it comes with fries, but upgrade them to the poutine.  Fries were nothing special.  House salad: fresh greens, healthy portion, great offset to the carbs & meat.  Chopped Liver Sandwich: moist, flavorful, caramelized onions - best I've ever had.  Carrot cake: immense, drizzled with caramel - don't miss out on the desert.  Cheesecake looked amazing and monolithic.  Service was very friendly, and food arrived incredibly fast.  Like faster than fast food fast, but could not be any fresher.  Ask for Nadia's section.  She's fast, funny, attentive and will make you feel at home."}
{"text":"Really good breakfast. Pancakes, waffle, eggs, bagels and coffee were all delicious.  Also they Have $6 specials till 9am, and they are regular size portions. Waitstaff are very friendly."}
{"text":"Tried this restaurant while in town for the Grand Prix and was very happy. The prices are reasonable and portion size was great. Smoked meat sandwich with Swiss cheese was great, upgraded fries to poutine and didn't regret it for a second. The real highlight of the meal was the cheesecake, though. A nice, thick, deep slice of perfectly made cheesecake. The filling was heavy and creamy and not infused with the flavouring: leaving it flavoured on top and pure in the middle. Absolutely perfect."}
{"text":"I love the central location, the clean interior and the attentive service at Reuben's. I'll also admit that the food is pretty decent. All these components point towards a 4-star rating.  However, I ordered their \"famous\" smoked meat sandwich for $15.99 and it just did not compare to the ones i've had at Schwartz's or Main's. The meat was tender, but it lacked a certain depth of flavor, even after requesting the \"fattty\" smoked meat. Also, the $15.99 price point, is a bit steeper than what you would find elsewhere.  Reuben's is nice with comfortable seating and attentive waitstaff. However, it is slightly tourist-centered and their pricing reflects this. Reuben's is still a good dining option in the area. Their dessert display is also quite impressive.  ***3.5 stars***"}
{"text":"Aha! Great place with awesome smoked meat!  The smoked meat sandwich was great, large portion with great rye bread and slaw. The pickle was too salty and inedible for me. The Reuben's Smoked Meat Pizza was delightful; crispy, thin crust with loads of smoked meat and cheese. Their appetizers are quite mediocre on the other hand, the honey and mustard chicken filets were really dry and crunchy; also the basket were mainly fries and not many chicken.  The service was average, food came out pretty fast. The ambience was great, especially at night. If possible, try to be seated near the window, the street view is amazing. The food is very pricey, however the portions are quite large.  I have yet to try the legendary Carrot Cake and Smoked Meat Poutine, and I shall do that in the near future."}
{"text":"Le service est bien, les plats sont énormes, surtout pour un midi, le tout dans un décor mélange entre brasserie et dinner.  La spécialité est le sandwich au smoked meat, avec possibilité de choisir le style (medium, fat,...). Prix un peu élevé cependant."}
{"text":"The smoke meat at Reuben's is the only thing I order here because it's excellent, just as good as more touristic places like Schwartz without the wait. But make sure you get the medium if you don't like dry smoke meat. The customer service and seating is good and the down town location is convenient and very close to museums in Golden Mile. Good friendly service, great location and excellent smoke meat!"}
{"text":"This place is close to major shopping and has a menu that works for a wide range of eaters. Huge portions with a fantastic grilled veggie sandwich. A decent place to stop and grab a quick bite to eat."}
{"text":"Loved the poutine and this was officially my first poutine even though I had been to French Canada before.  Got the famous smoked meat corned beef sandwich. Huge portion! The meat was second only to a little Jewish place in Milwaukee that I know of which puts this in great company.  If you're looking for lunch and a beer this is a great choice."}
{"text":"This place has To Have The creme de la crop Smoked meat, me and the family really enjoyes the food including Salmon filet and grilled chicken, both really Fresh and cooked perfect, oh and the Beer selection Is something !"}
{"text":"Well Reuben's isn't the smoothest place.The music is too loud and it's current crap.However , let's admit  it , that's not really key.You're probably here for smoked meat.It's pretty good.They serve it with fries which were surprisingly good.Service is efficient and pleasant.Not where I'd go to relax but it's good at what it does.Also it has a full bar.I know you're supposed to want to drink this with cherry soda or celray  but I admit I like beer better.Price are within sane bounds and the place is reasonably good looking."}
{"text":"Very good smoked meat one of the best in Montreal, but by no means better than Schwatz's, however they offer a wider range in their menu, all very good delicious and genenerous portions.service is great , cost is no means in the cheap range expect to pay 25$ to 30$ per."}
{"text":"I've been saving my 100th review for a place like this ...  The Chop Chop poutine is awesome!!!!!!  The french fries are thin, crispy, salty  - kind of like McDonald french fries.  The gravy was rich and tasty.  The cheese was melted and plentiful.  And, the whole thing was covered in chopped bits of smoked meat.    Although the poutine was listed as an appetizer, I ordered it as a meal.  And honestly, it was plenty!    The sandwiches here are as big as your head.  There is even a $75 sandwich with an insane amount of meat.    My husband ordered the super sandwich and I had a bite - it was delicious but not as good as my poutine.  The accompanying slaw was a little sour for my liking.    The desserts seem huge too.  The slices of cheese cake looked really delicious and a lot of other tables ordered dessert but we decided we had had enough.  Decor is a little like the Keg.  Lots of business type corporate folks and possibly tourists.  The place was busy but not waiting for 20 minutes type busy - we were seated right away.  Our server was pleasant enough.  Loooved it!! :)"}
{"text":"Smoked meat is not skimped on and very tasty. Fries just ok but coleslaw was above par for sure."}
{"text":"Great service and amazing food! I started with a great Caesar salad and then finished it off with the best smoked meat I have ever had! I have been to many places around the world that serves smoked meat and I have to say this restaurant beats them all! (Even Schwartz!)"}
{"text":"Being in Montreal we had to go for the Montreal smoked meat sandwich!  Meh! Didn't love it,didn't hate.  Was okay!  I saw Minnie Driver here a few years ago!  That's worth a star!"}
{"text":"Best smoked meat; shwartz is overrated and the wait isn't worth it but this place was delicious!"}
{"text":"The Poutine topped with corned beef was VERY good... We shared the \"club roll\" sandwich (portions are big), it was a bit overwhelming but good."}
{"text":"Best hamburger ever! Juicy, well cooked and delicious  The staff very friendly and helpful and if you sit at the end of the row you will be seeing how they prepare the burgers"}
{"text":"We had an enjoyable experience at Reuben's and the service was fabulous. Our waiter was very considerate and timely! It was quite busy when we got there but since we were only a party of two, we got seated quickly.   Our friends told us that the 'Famous Super Sandwich' was pretty good but that we absolutely needed to try a burger and they were right. We got the Mont-Royal burger and it was incredible--very flavourful and juicy.   If you're in the downtown area, it is definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"Solid restaurant, good service & atmosphere. Very family oriented.  Definitely order the Original Reuben Sandwich. The pumpernickel is slightly toasted, which gives the sandwich nice variety in texture. The Montreal Smoked Meat is DIVINE, as is the horseradish, and cheese that comes in it. Solid coleslaw, okay poutine.  I wouldn't order anything else, to be honest. If you're going to Reuben's, you're going there for the Smoked Meat.  Could definitely upgrade the atmosphere with a face lift - maybe have a little more light as it was very dark. Just a thought :)"}
{"text":"I was expecting far better but for getting in and seated right away when it was so busy to being served right away I'll give them that.   Unfortunately our waitress wasn't overly happy, she seemed rather rushed and stressed.  The food quality was very large.  Good thing my boyfriend and I shared the Montreal smoked meat sandwich and an order of poutine with smoked meat.  The food was about a 3/5.  Not sure if the sandwich bread is to be soggy but it was.  Meat was tasty.   Poutine lacked flavour; I was expecting a much better meatier tasting gravy.   The coleslaw was very good.     Overall I was hoping for a better experience.   Maybe next time will be better."}
{"text":"the best smoked meat sandwich I've had. I find them tastier than Schwartz and Main Deli -  my husband is a true meat-connoisseur and I have his certificate for this. 5* for ambiance, 5* for food taste. 4* for service ( i have been here quite a few times and my overall experience with service has been mixed) 5* for quantity per plate. 5* for price vs. value for money. 5* for wait periods ( I have always been here at peak times on weekends but never have had to wait for more than 15 minutes). When I do have to wait, I just peek into adjacent H&M for that 15 minutes - so no complaints!"}
{"text":"J'étais mitigée pour ce Deli, mon père est en ville et de la panoplie de restaurants que nous avons à Montréal, le Reuben's?? Mais bon, nous étions 15 personnes alors menu varie pour tous, bouffe moyenne mais honnête et bon service. Pratique pour un resto sur Ste-Catherine... Attention il y en a deux et celui au coin de Peel est bcp plus propre et plus beau décor."}
{"text":"OMG the cakes.... There's a Black and White cake thing I don't think it's on the menu? It was so good!!! It was literally melting in my mouth. My friend told me about this and I loved it!!! I wonder if they have other things in secret. Also my other friend said Reuben's burger was the best burger she had had in town. I haven't tried that but I will some time in the future."}
{"text":"Rubens has been a favourite go to in Montreal for years. I've loved this place. Previous to my last visit, I've been wowed by the service, price and food - especially the smoked meat. After my last experience, I'm a bit disappointed. The service is still spectacular. Was not impressed with the 30% to 40% increase in the price for a smoked meat sandwich. What was 12 bucks with fries not too long ago is now $18 or $19. And apparently asking for no mustard means that they will add mustard, then try to half assed wipe it off. I did walk out with a 5lbs brisket to take home to Toronto as you just can't find this kind of meat back home. Sadly they charge well over $11 per pound to buy a la carte."}
{"text":"I enjoy this place. Their sandwiches can sometimes be dry but all in all I like the smoked meat. Been there countless times to try a few sandwiches, rocky top chicken and a steak. Never been wowed but never been disappointed.   Good place to eat prior to a movie."}
{"text":"I always take friends and family here, whenever we visit the city. Everyone always loves the steak with mashed potatoes and garden salad. The portion sizes are huge and the price is quite decent. The environment is cute and I never have to wait more than 10 minutes to get a seat."}
{"text":"Come eat here. No matter what you eat you won't be disappointed. Awesome food, nice service and it was the fastest I had ever gotten my food at a restaurant!"}
{"text":"The food:  We had the famous super sandwich (10 ounces) and we had the smoked meat poutine. Both were absolutely amazing.   The sandwich was a little dry for me but my preferance has always been a little less dry. However,  I ordered some gravy on the side and I was set. The meat it's self is just absolutely delicious.   Ambiance: the place is nice, clean and with a moderate level of noise. It wasn't too hot or too cold.   Service: our waiter was great and very efficient.  As well as super nice .  I hope to return when I am in Montreal again."}
{"text":"I like this place! haven't been disappointed yet! Apparently they have good breakfast which I plan to try out some time!"}
{"text":"Don't eat here, unless you want to be ripped off with ridiculously high prices for below average food and a food poisoning! AVOID AT ALL COST !"}
{"text":"I've been to Reuben's many times over many years, often with friends who wanted to eat some place close by when downtown. I've never had a great meal there. The last time I ate there we were 4 and the whole thing cost something like $40 per person (total over $160.00), just for smoke meat sandwiches, soft drinks and a side order of onion rings ($15 bucks!), which were horrendous. The sandwich was ok but small. It wasn't worth the price. The waiter was very rude and brusque."}
{"text":"The best smoked meat poutine. Large and delicious, great after the bar fun the famous for the cheese cake, too much for one. Share everything!  Huge sandwich, friendly service."}
{"text":"Amazing Deli, really good food and a nice atmosphere. Like it a lot, I visit that spot ever time I'm in Montreal. The food is very delicious (you have to taste the smoked meat) and the stuff is friendly. Like it!!!"}
{"text":"Nothing in particular is good. The place is nice and big. The waiter was rude, he even left the card reader on the table and I had to complete the electronic payment by my self. The food is not great, the poutine was good (I guess) and the beef sandwich was horrible, the smoked beef tasted weird. Will never go back there..."}
{"text":"Love their smoke-meet sandwich with the Reuben special sauce. If you are in this neighborhood, this is a must go place for the smoke-meet sandwich. They also serve USDA prime steaks. Haven't try them, but I will next time I'm there. Staff are very friendly and can speak English."}
{"text":"I used to come here with co-workers all the time when it was someones birthday or when someone new joined the team.  I've got mixed reviews about this place though, as the food seems always inconsistent to me.  I usually get the smoked meat plate or a smoked meat sandwich and to be frank, there are much better places to get smoked meat in Montreal.  Right at the downtown core though, there is only really Reuben's and Dunn's.  After several horrible experiences with Dunn's, I'll take Reuben's for now.  The service is pretty standard, the employees are fairly attentive and come by every now and again.  The choices are the usual sandwiches, burgers or pub food plates.  They do have a decent selection of breakfast menu items though, if you're in earlier you can get some serious pancakes with baked fruits on top!  Probably the better choice of the food options.  Due to the location I would recommend this place if you are right at the downtown core and are looking for some quick smoked meat.  If you want the best smoked meat and have time however, head over to the Main or Schwartz's up St Laurent for the true best of the best Montreal smoked meat!"}
{"text":"Had famous sandwich which has tons of beef brisket in it. It was so tender. It makes me feel like going back there again."}
{"text":"It was just \"ok\" and barely.  Smoked meat which has a great reputation tasted to me like it had way too much Coriander (pickling spice) which I found pretty gross.  Wife had roast beef which was very dry.   Update after reply asking if I let server know.  I didn't tell the server, as didn't think there was anything he could do to correct it.   The cheesecake was amazing."}
{"text":"???????????  ?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????  ?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????  ?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????  ??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????  ?????????????????"}
{"text":"We ordered the builder's platter and smoked meat poutine. The smoked meat was succulent and flavorful.  The platter comes with slices of bread, so you can build yoir own sandwich. Ask for more bread, as I am sure you will need a few more slices to finish the meat. The atmosphere us casual and the fact that the establishment had kid-friendly seating was a great bonus (vs.  Schwart's). The strawberry cheesecake is a must!"}
{"text":"On a cold Montreal night we walked into this place that was buzzing with great atmosphere.  We waited 10min before we could get a table, as we hadn't made a reservation.  We really got lucky with our waiter, Kevin, who was a cheerful, attentive, and funny guy.  The drinks came on time. And so did the starters & main course.  A definite must try specially if you want great smoked Montreal meat.   Server/ Host knowledge: 5 Server/host attitude: 5 Fast service: 4.5 Food Menu: 5 Drinks Menu: 5 Food quality: 4.5 Food Portion: 5 Ambience: 4.5 Distance to other tables: 4.5 Cleanliness: 4.5 Comfort: 4.5 Waiting time to get seated: 4 Price: 4"}
{"text":"Reuben's was good, but not great or anything too special.  Service: It was an extremely busy night there, so I can understand the somewhat slower service, but there were a few times that we were waiting for more drink service and water refills longer than we should have been.   Food: The person I was with had the Tuna Melt, and it was good. I had the Reuben's spaghetti, which is essentially a spaghetti with meat sauce, but the meat is their signature smoked meat. The dish itself was alright, but their meat itself was delicious.  Bottom line:  I suggest you give this place a shot. If you stick to the right dishes you can leave with a fairly modest bill and your thirst and hunger quenched. It can get a bit pricy (for what you get) if you get into the more expensive dishes."}
{"text":"AMAZING I got the original Reuban's sandwich and I cannot wait to go back for another. Amazing quality and you definitely get your money's worth.   Service was very good, friendly and helpful on all ends.  Buy a loaf of rye bread from their front end bakery. One of the best I've had, carrying it around as we shopped down Ste Catherine's was a challenge as it nearly weighed 5lbs. That good!  We are going back for that 7 layer carrot cake."}
{"text":"Quality smoked meat.  Can order lean to fatty.  Why would you order lean?  I shake my head sometimes.  Fries are ok, service is good.    Great coleslaw, actually, crisp, cold and tangy.  I will return, and you should too when you get the smoked meat craving."}
{"text":"We always order the smoke meat and change the fries to a poutine. Portions are always huge and always leave here super full. It's rare that we order dessert since we are full, but when we do have a chance too, we get the cheese cake or the oreo. The food is always good."}
{"text":"No line-up.  Need I say more?  Great booths, service was fantastic, free wifi throughout, let us linger forever, food was good (French Fries were pretty meh but you're not hungry enough after eating the sandwich to need them)."}
{"text":"Reuben's has the best pastrami I have ever eaten in my life!!! This was the first restaurant that I stepped foot in during my trip to Montreal. It was then that I fell in love with the city.   The menu has quite a variety of items. I had to try the poutine so I ordered the BBQ pulled pork poutine. The crispy fries with the delicious gravy and cheese slathered on top with the juicy pulled pork and BBQ sauce, it was amazing. I ordered the original 76 sandwich which is served with Swiss cheese and mustard on a brioche bun. The pastrami was super juicy and it wasn't too salty. It was perfect with the bun! This sandwich came with fries, coleslaw and a pickle. The coleslaw was a little bland and the veggies were too chopped up.   Service was wonderful. All the staff were super friendly and patient. I highly recommend this place!!!"}
{"text":"This was a great place for brunch. The food was good but it was crowded & the wait was a little long. I'd recommend the place."}
{"text":"I have visited Reuben's twice already and I have been nothing but satisfied. After a long day of shopping on Saint Catherine Street, this place is located conveniently right in the middle of everything. I find that this area is live and attracts all types of locals and tourists. Well when I get into this place I see a lot of meat and I love it. There is friendly staff that always try their best to please. The first time I went just to grab a snack, so I decided to get the poutine. To drink I had their lemonade, honestly I wasn't expecting it to be good and wanted to change my beverage but the waitress happened to bring it by that time, so I tried it and loved it. So the poutine came out and there was a lot of this cheesy gooey goodness. I struggled to finish it but the brisket and gravy toppings were too good. The last time I came here was with my mom and dad to grab some dinner. My mom had the salmon w/ wild rice and mashed and she loved it. My dad had the rueben classic sandwhich with a ceasar salad and fries, didn't hear a word from him while he stuffed his face, he loved his food too. I remember I wasn't feeling to well that day and I grabbed chicken fingers w/ a side of poutine and it was hella filling. I love a lot of food especially when its soo good. I had a great experience here and I may make it a tradition to come here every year I visit Montréal :)"}
{"text":"Great sandwiches and desserts. A bit on the expensive side though but worth it none the less.   Service is nice and the atmosphere is great. But it's kinda crammed seating. Hard to get up and move out of seats for example.   I recommend the dijon chicken strips, obviously the Reubens, and the melt sandwiches. They're all huge portions and to die for. Their frites are kinda meh, like frozen McDonald's style so avoid the poutine and fry sides if possible. But it's hard to even get to the fries when the sandwiches are so huge.   Good Montreal spot to visit."}
{"text":"Friendly service, tourist area pricing, decent food.  Didn't have the smoked meat this visit but it was never anything to write home about."}
{"text":"First evening in Montreal and a couple blocks from our hotel we find Reuben's, a nice place that looks to have awesome smoked meat sandwiches and mile high cheesecake!  This place did not disappoint from the greeting and quick seating at the door to our fantastic waiter, Kevin, and tasty meal.  Give this place a try it will not disappoint!"}
{"text":"Yum! Had the smoked meat poutine and the build your own smoked meat sandwich. Both were really good. The portions here are very large so consider sharing. We had to wait about 40 minutes on a Friday night around 8 pm to get a seat, but it was well worth the wait. The staff are very nice and helpful. Pretty attentive as well considering how many tables they each had.   You can also get takeaway so if you're in a rush head to the bar area and order something to bring home with you.   I even liked the coleslaw and fries that came with our meal. I'd definitely come back when I visit Montreal again."}
{"text":"Every time I go to the movies, I follow with dinner at Reuben's. The line moves fast, if there is one. The service is invariably fast and efficient  The standard and fancied-up deli food is not stellar but still very good. The atmosphere young, happy and noisy, with far less creatures-with-distasteful-implants than you'd typically find in a similar joint in the area or on St-Laurent, with is a welcome change.  The carrot cake is legendary -- ask them not to drown it in caramel sauce, though.   However, their draft beer is a serious drag. Molson Ex, I mean, come on..."}
{"text":"The smoked meat is surprisingly lean, without sacrificing flavor. Good sized portions mean you will not leave hungry, and prices are very reasonable. I came here for breakfast on the last day of my trip and look forward to returning soon."}
{"text":"Went to Montreal for business and had the pleasure of being invited to try Reuben's Smoked Meat Sandwich and Poutine. Both were outstanding. If you are ever in town, you owe it to yourself to try both of these dishes."}
{"text":"Earlier in the week, we had dinner at what we assumed to be the smoked meat top dog in Montreal; Schwartz's. Then, through the grapevine, we became aware of Reuben's Deli & Steakhouse. We had to investigate.  Though, like Schartz's, Reuben's has a significant history, (established in 1976), it has none of the old school feel. Before you even walk into the restaurant, you'll see its glowing Broadway lights from down the street. Walking in, you'll experience the cool, mellow decor, plenty of cured meats for sale, wine racks, a dessert section, and a pickling jar section. Reuben's has plenty of cozy booth and table seating, so feel free to bring a group.  After a relatively short wait, our smoked sandwiches came. Generally, their \"Famous Super Sandwich\" sticks to the smoked meat basics: copious amounts of smoked brisket, between two thin slices of rye bread, with yellow mustard. Thankfully, Reuben's answered my prayers, left tradition, and added what these sandwiches beg for; Swiss cheese! If we were to compare Reuben's sandwich to the classic Schwartz's, Reuben's is the clear winner. Sure, they add Swiss cheese, (bless their souls), but how they really win is by serving up smoked brisket that so wonderfully juicy that it makes a Schwartz sandwich seem like the Sahara. And what else is a smoked meat sandwich but a vehicle to serve you up irresponsible amounts of meat. The sandwich also comes with fries, coleslaw, and a pickle.  You'll pay a bit more for dinner at Reuben's, but take my word for it, you'll eat better. Whenever I'm in the city next, I'm heading straight back to see what else they've got to offer."}
{"text":"Pilier de mon alimentation lorsque j'était à l'université, Reuben's deli a drastiquement changé. Dans les points positif, le décor qui avait grand besoin d'un rafraichissement à complètement été refait. Belles banquettes, du bois, finis il me semble (du moins je ne les ai pas vue) les pots douteux de piments et cornichons marinés.  Bon après, ça gâte. Premièrement, avec un rehaussement du décor, les prix dans le menu ont suivis. 18$ pour un sandwichs aux smoked meat, c'est exagéré. Quand on ajoute un service maladroit et le fait qu'il faut courir pour la facture, on peut dire que l'endroit à mal vieilli.  Comme dirait Bob Dylan; le monde et les temps changent... Mais pas toujours pour le mieux."}
{"text":"Very crowded restaurant with mediocre service and food. I had a BLTA (bacon, lettuce tomato and avocado) sandwich on sourdough bread. It was just ok and not memorable! The restaurant packs a great crowd so maybe other options on the menu are more tastier and popular. The menu has so many beef/smoked meat choices that it was difficult to make a decision."}
{"text":"This place was just around the corner from our hotel so it seemed a good place to get breakfast. It turned out to be so good that we cam back here almost every day we were in town. The décor is modern deli, with plenty of seating and a long counter filled with all sorts of scrumptuous looking desserts to tempt you. In the city that gave it's name to Montreal Smoked Meat, you either do it well or don't do it at all. Reuben's does it really well. I had the smoked meat and eggs my first morning, just to test them and see if they were good enough. They are. The meat is wonderful (get the fat, don't get the lean) and breakfast portions are adequate for all but the biggest diners. The next visit I had the Reuben's Omelette with smoked meat and cheese - delicious and filling! On the last visit I had the menagerie skillet - plenty of deliciousness - but I couldn't finish it was so big. Food comes quickly here, service is quick and crisp, and we didn't have any problems in 3 visits. My recommendation - take some meat to go after you've filled up!"}
{"text":"Yum yum yum yum. One of the best if not the best smoked meat sammich in the city. Open late, nice service, and a gorgeous restaurant all contribute to the 5-star rating."}
{"text":"When in Montreal it's a rule that at least one meal needs to include smoked meats. Walking around St Catherine and trying to avoid the hail, we decided to stop in here for breakfast. The restaurant was huge but honestly, not super clean. The floor was a mess and it made me wonder about how it looks by dinner. The breakfast menu was huge. I ended up getting a regular breakfast with smoked meat while my dining partner got an omelette with smoked meat. I have to say I enjoyed this smoked meat better than other places we've tried it in Montreal. The breakfast was a bit greasy but the addition of the smoked meat was very nice. There are so many places to eat in the area that I probably won't stop in again but if you're looking for some good smoked meat then I recommend popping in. No wait time and you can even visit their deli section and get some smoked meat to go."}
{"text":"In the heart of downtown Montreal you don't expect friendly service and decent food as the hoards come and go all day and all night long.  Reuben's aims to please every picky eater and appetite out there.  We had the smoked meat sandwich and the Reuben sandwich with fries and coleslaw and pickle.    Really good smoked meat and generous portion of it along with the mound of fries.  Just had  to make room for the cheesecake as it called to us the entire time we sat across from the dessert case.  Creamy light and I could eat another slice good!!  Service was very friendly and our guy had a sense of humour which is always a nice surprise.  Prices are what you should expect for the area.  Definitely worth a return visit!"}
{"text":"Un très bon endroit à Montréal pour découvrir la \"smoked meat\" accompagnée de sa bière rousse locale."}
{"text":"Location: In the heart of downtown MTL - on Ste. Catherine. Street parking is available [metered]. The closest subway is probably Peel [green line].  The place: My friends and I stopped here around 11:30pm following our latest U2 extravaganza because well, we are famished. Even though there were several patrons, we didn't have to wait for a table. The space itself is ordinary and a little dark. They've got an upstairs but I'm not sure if there's seating up there or if it's just where the washrooms are located.   The goods: The menu offers a good variety of options but I had a rare hankering for smoked meat. Unfortunately, the only option they had on the menu was for a huge portion that I'd say, no one person can eat solo (unless you're a big beefy man - then you're good). My friend and I decided to share the platter so we basically each had a half of the smoked meat sandwich and split the fries. I enjoyed the meat. The fries were good though if memory serves, they weren't of the home made variety.   Service: Great - our waiter was really nice and friendly.  Price point: A little spendier than some places, but Reubens is catering to a large tourist population so not surprising.   This is a good go-to spot if you're in need of sustenance in the middle of the night =-D"}
{"text":"I guess it's a good smoked meat place.  The smoked meat in itself was really good. No doubt.  Food wise: The meat is 10/10 but, all our plates came with blend, cold, unseasoned frozen fries. And 1/4 cup of store bought coleslaw. So really you have half of your plate that is really good, then the other half is school cafeteria bad.  Btw, I had the chopped liver sandwich and it was good. I would had more mustard and would have traded the fries for extra filling.   Then there where a list of other things that made me tick:  The washroom is not really great (like the doors are so low you can almost see over it) and located on the second floor.  The menu is way to big. They should halve the menu at least.  We arrived all having smoked meat sandwiches in our head and then second guess while looking through the seemingly endless possibilities. Then all decided to stick with the original plan. So from the restaurant perspective, we wasted a good 15 minutes scouting for nothing.  One thing I will give to this place is thd service was really great, fast and courteous."}
{"text":"My favourite Restaurant in Montreal. Jamais  déçu par la qualité du service malgré qu'il est toujours bien occupé. Tous les plats que j'ai gouter sont délicieux, généreux et toujours avec une tres belle présentation."}
{"text":"I'm not typically a fan of the meat-overload sort of dishes that this place serves. However, the smoked meat at Reuben's (and specifically the Reuben sandwich, unsurprisingly) was simply incredible. It was flavorful and soft and delicious. It wasn't greasy or oily, and didn't eat super heavily. YUM. Their desserts were good but not very memorable - so I'd stick with the meat, and you'll be very happy."}
{"text":"In one phrase, Ruebens was the top dining highlight of my trip with my son to the Montreal Formula One Grand Prix. Here is why. My party of two ( my ten year old son and I) were told the wait would be about 10 - 15 minutes to be seated for dinner which was at about 630. A gentleman retrieved us from the sidewalk outside the restaurant in 3 minutes and escorted us to our seats. +1. I suspect he was the owner but I'm not sure. He connected with my son immediately and made him feel very special. \"I got a table for you as quick as possible knowing you were here Michael\" he said directly after asking my son what his name was. +2. Awesome customer rapport. The food was terrific. I had the Montreal Ribeye which was cooked perfectly. A couple of Old Fashions to go with the steak was perfect. +3. The menu showed lots of other great drink options. As described, from our first contact to the staff to the last, the service was incredible and very attentive. They were very efficient while very busy during Grand Prix weekend. Lots of great options for kids and adults alike. We plan on making Grand Prix weekend each year and we will also be stopping at Reuben's each time, guaranteed."}
{"text":"Service and food --- top notch.  welcoming and kind, clean and inviting.  food was well prepared and reasonably priced.  Would return...."}
{"text":"It's okay food. They make a weird old fashion. Can't go wrong with salad or the onion rings are awesome. The cheesecake is expensive and not even that good. Keep in mind this Reuben's is way better then the other one down the street that you have to walk downstairs that one is ghetto and the food and service is not good."}
{"text":"I stopped by this restaurant while I was in Montreal on Business. Ordered the smoked meat poutine fries and a Molson beer.  The Molson was... molsoney but the poutine fries were great! I would eat here again"}
{"text":"So-so service? Cheap prices and great smoked meat. One of the few options left in Montreal for smoked meat."}
{"text":"Empty place on a Saturday afternoon.  Fries were crap...frozen and no potato. Sandwiches were just ok. A lot of meat, but nothing groundbreaking. Nice service....but will not return."}
{"text":"Delicious smoked meat.  Terrible rude server:  We entered Reuben's Deli on St. Catherine Street around 8 p.m. and informed the hostess we were a table of 11.  We only had to wait a few minutes to be seated.  When our server arrived with a tray full of ice waters, I told him that we won't be needing that as our table would like hot waters instead.  Two of my cousins did go for the cold waters he had on his tray which made me look like I was trying to troll the server....  I already knew what I wanted to order -- the smoked meat sandwich of course!  Thus, my mom and I shared the Famous Super Sandwich (their 10 oz sandwich) with an extra Baby House Salad as a side.  After everyone at the table had decided on what to order, the server came by.  We had previously decided amongst ourselves that we would be paying individually and thus I told the server, \"We will be paying individually, so we'd like to request separate bills please.\"  The server replied something along the lines of, \"Sure but you haven't ordered yet.\"  I replied, \"Well, I just wanted to let you know before we placed our orders.\"  ....  Uh, I was informing him that before we placed our orders because oftentimes, servers prefer that the request for separate bills be announced prior to ordering.  My intention was simply to make our request clear at the outset instead of announcing it at the end.  I didn't like this server's smartass remark already.  Anyway, we placed our orders and at the very end when everyone was finished, it was established that each family would pay for themselves.  My cousin confirmed this with the server.  Although the server wasn't speaking to me at this point, I overheard the server saying to them, \"It's a little confusing when one person says for the table to want separate bills and then another wants the bills to be paid per family.\"  I heard this and felt it really wasn't necessary to voice that part again.  A more professional server would say, \"So to be clear, not individual bills anymore but separate bills per family; right?\" instead of the backhanded comment he said.  Rude.  Anyway, it did take some time for the food to arrive.  This wasn't a problem to me because we had the whole night to ourselves and weren't rushed but for some of my family members who were hungry and not used to waiting for all the dishes to come at once (which is the habit at western restaurants compared to Chinese ones), they were getting frustrated with the long wait.  Fortunately there was free wifi to tide us over with while we waited.  The food in actuality took around 20 minutes to arrive.  The Famous Super Sandwich came with fries, coleslaw, and a pickle.  It was a 10 oz sandwich \"piled high\" and served on rye bread with mustard. I was so excited to get my hands on it and dig it!  The smoked meat was actually quite good.  It was tender and moist.  The rye bread was a bit soft with the mustard on it.  I ate it quickly to avoid the moist rye bread from falling apart.  I liked how big of a portion the meat was!   I'm glad we shared this between the two of us since I definitely wouldn't have been able to finish one whole sandwich by myself.  (Glad that the sandwich was already split in half.)  The portion of fries was soooo impressively large.  They were skinny fries.  The coleslaw was so good and was like comfort food to me after eating the smoked meat sandwich.  The Baby House Salad was fresh and a good portion of greens for us in conjunction with the smoked meat sandwich.  My relatives seemed to enjoy the smoked meat sandwiches they ordered too.  It was their first time eating Montreal smoked meat.  My aunt who ordered the pasta though thought the pasta was too al dente for her taste.  When it came to paying the bill, I'm not sure why the server had to again emphasize the fact that '\"one person\" had mentioned individual billing at first and it turned out not to be'... it wasn't necessary to voice that again. ... a-hole server.  All in all, I'm very glad we were able to try this restaurant.  I can finally compare it to Schwartz's smoked meat!  However, although the food was good, the service here from the male server that night was downright rude and spoke unnecessary backhanded unprofessional comments directed at me. :/  It definitely made for a mixed first impression of Reuben's Deli."}
{"text":"Has Bourdain been here? Asking because it was actually good, we got seated easily without a reservation and the poutine was good; the additional topping of brisket melted in my mouth, unlike Schwartz's. And our server was great, she tried to save us money rather than waste it."}
{"text":"Ideally located on St Catherine's, Reubens promises excellent smoked meat but delivers less than that. While the food is certainly tasty (particularly their signature Jack Daniels BBQ pulled beef and their chipotle salad dressing), you will absolutely find your experience underwhelming and overpriced.   I had the \"Original 76\" from the weekday Business Lunch menu. Supposedly this is a reuben and you would expect as much given the restaurant name. However, it is served on a dry brioche bun rather than marble rye and does not include Russian dressing or sauerkraut; which to me, means it's not a reuben. The reuben itself originated in the US; debatable whether it came specifically from a NY deli or a Russian small business owner from Nebraska. Either way. I'm confused as to why this place claims to have the original, yet they did not invent it. Was supposed to come with 8oz of smoked meat and appeared to be less. Sandwich was cold and cheese not melted. Mediocre coleslaw and passable fries; $15. Pass on this. Clearly the debate is settled--the reuben did not originate at Reuben's.  The smoked meat was not the best I've has in Montreal. Schwartz's is better though I imagine their are better choices out there.   Also on the lunch menu were the BBQ beef tacos which, while quite delicious, were overpriced at $18, coming with three small tacos and a salad. However I must admit the quality of the pulled beef is quite good.   Maybe this is not your stop if you're seeking smoked meat, but it might hit the spot if you're in the area."}
{"text":"I didn't care for the salad much but my friend liked it.  I thought the ingredients were a bit random - mango, citrus, lettuce, chicken..  I enjoyed the classic sandwich and found the cole slaw to be a pretty perfect complement.  The fries were the crispest I've had so far in this town (haven't had McDonald's yet).  Pretty solid deli!"}
{"text":"This place has the best poutine in Montreal (trust me I've had a poutine or more a day for the last week!.... don't judge). Finally I found a place that makes their poutine with \"small cut\" \"thin cut\" fries! LOVE it! The beef short rib poutine was my favourite thing on the menu, too bad my husband was the one who ordered it! I had the smoked meat poutine which was also good but I would definitely order the beef short rib one! The only downfall to this restaurant was the cheesecake we got at the end, which LOOKED delicious but was dry and tasted like it sat in the fridge too long. Also my cappuccino which looked equally delicious was $4.99 and luke warm. Definitely come for the meat but leave for the dessert"}
{"text":"One of my fave places in Montreal!!  There are 2 Reuben's on Ste-Catherine's, but this one is the classier/chic restaurant with a massive menu from the classic smoked meat to pizza/pasta, burgers, steaks and salads. The place is generally busy, but I've never had to wait in line to get seated. Even if it gets a little bit loud during the dinner hours, but I actually enjoy a busy and lively restaurant over the contrary. Loads of tourists, but locals go here to! Portions are huge, you'll get more than enough for your hunger I promise. All the ingredients they use are fresh and tasty. Just go with your feels while you're reading the menu and you're probably not making a bad decision.  I've tried most of their sandwiches/burgers and liked all of them! However I've never tried the steaks since I think for the same price range I could get a better plate at Montreal's many other famous steakhouses. If you're new to Mtl's smoked meat, order the Builder's plate. You get to make you're own sandwich from a full plate of meat with 4 slices of bread, pickles, coleslaw and fries!  ***TIP: I find the smoked meat from the Builder's plate to be better quality compared to the meat in the sandwiches. Salads are great and come in huge portions as well, strongly recommended. Desserts are a MUST. Make room for the strawberry cheesecake please, it tastes light and fluffy, definitively not overwhelming like the ones you normally get. Price: A little expensive, but since it is located at the heart of downtown, just next to Quartier des Spectacles, the higher pricing is justifiable.   Service is hit or miss, because the waiter I usually get makes me quite uncomfortable (isn't really helpful and attitude is sometimes condescending/rude). Whenever I get seated at his tables, I don't expect my water to be refilled unless I ask the busboy, and he rarely comes to check if everything is alright. Even if I am not a fan of the service, I love the food/location/atmosphere of Reuben's, and these are more than enough reasons for me to come back again and again.  **This is not true for all the waiters! Everybody can have a bad day from times to times, I can understand.  I've been here for brunch too, and I like it as much as I like the dinner. Prices are very good as well, I recommend the skillets."}
{"text":"Reubens is in the heart of downtown on Saint Catherine street, with its big sign it hard to miss and this place is know for its smoked meat sandwiches which what put them on map and I dont blame them for keeping to it.  Thou I went a different route then smoke meat sandwich. As people have read in my reviews. Im a burger guy, while the burgers weren't on cheap side, they were a good. I had the Alamo burger. Which was two type of cheese,  onion strings and bbq sauce with a 1/2 pound patty it was a good size and filling for me.  the patty was juicy, favourful, all and all a good meal,  got to have smoked meat if i got time before i leave"}
{"text":"Everyone tells me to visit Reuben's for their smoked meat and I'm glad a did. The Original Reuben Sandwich was stacked high and served with short string fries and coleslaw. The meat was juicy and very flavorful.   We also ordered the Smoked Meat Mac & Cheese as a starter. The description says the mac & cheese is sweet but it was much sweeter than we thought. The chopped smoked meat on top was delicious and goes well the the mac & cheese."}
{"text":"Awesome smoked beef sandwich. Great friendly service. Wonderful grilled vegetables that had a wonderful char on them. Great flavor. Chicken sandwich, roast beef sandwich and French fries were good but not extraordinary."}
{"text":"Smoked meat and poutine are Montreal's contributions to the culinary world.  While made from brisket, Montreal-style smoked meat is nothing like Texas brisket, or really, like anything else.  Highly seasoned and melt-in-your-mouth tender, purveyors such as Reuben's stack the smoked meat high on rye bread with a smattering of yellow mustard.  While I have yet to experience this delicacy from the mythical Schwartz's, I'd have to say that the smoked meat from Reuben's is the best I've had in Montreal."}
{"text":"Ate at the bar. Had the NY Steak sandwich. Was pretty good, not great, as it had a considerable amount of gristle. The fries are like old time McDonald's string fries which I loved. Wife and I had a martini each. DO NOT GET A MARTINI AT REUBEN'S! Big glass with less than half filled. A complete and total ripoff. Ruined the meal for us."}
{"text":"Very yummy first impression of Montreal. The classic ruben was very tender and delicious. Exactly what I'd expect when I want a quality ruben. Also had the poutin with the smoked meat on top. Seems like such a guilty pleasure but I enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Good food for the touristy neighbourhood. A few vegetarian options, the pizza is really damn tasty if you eat cheese. Also, the latkes are pretty fantastic with the cheddar in them. Service was good and the staff very friendly and upbeat."}
{"text":"Delicious, perfect food, clean, friendly and fast service. They don't let you pick how you want your steak dishes done, but the default well done is tremendously tender and juicy, so I was very satisfied and not at all disappointed even though I'm more of a \"medium rare\" person. Had the teriyaki steak salad, the Mr. had steak bacon melt and fries and everything was simply excellent. Cheesecake to die for. Will be back for poutine!!"}
{"text":"I ate here on game night before heading to the Bell Center ( Habs vs Nashville) and the service was really great for the amount of people seated. The food came quickly, although the ginger ale was pretty flat. My meal was excellent and totally satisfying. Habs lost but the meal was good! I've eaten at Reuben's few time and it's always been a lovely experience."}
{"text":"Very large sandwiches. High tourist prices. Fresh food. Parking in the area is hard to find so you may have to walk a few blocks to the restaurant."}
{"text":"Upscale vibe with fantastic smoked meat.   Excellent service with our server totally amenable to my wife and I splitting their monster one pound sandwich with fries.   No extra sharing charge.    Quality food, you get what you pay for.    Nice looking crowd."}
{"text":"Exactly what you would expect for a classic Montreal smoked meat diner. The type of place that will never change but serves good smoked meat with waitresses that have been there forever. If you have the stomach go for the Reuben's sandwhich and strawberry cheesecake which are the true classics. Well located and a good experience for visitors. Not the best but above average for sure"}
{"text":"Amazing Food...even better service! I had the club roll and my wife had the BLTA. Great value for the money.."}
{"text":"This was my first time in here and was greeted with the coziest, friendliest atmosphere. The service was excellent, unfortunately I forgot her name. She made sure what I ordered would be to my satisfaction by double checking with the manager. Great presentation, taste, and flavor. I definitely will go back & recommend it to all!"}
{"text":"We was staying right across the street when we were in Montreal, so it was only natural we came here the morning after a eventful night of drinking!  The place is pretty huge and accommodate a big group.  Our waiter was awesome and did a great job at entertaining us while serving us.  He made us feel welcomed, not like some places in Montreal..  We had got a whole bunch of food, the most memorable is the Ruben sandwich and the smoked meat poutine, it was great as hangover food!  Would suggest coming here for big groups!"}
{"text":"Pro: my server was great Pro: the fried wonton appetizer  Pro: Ceaser salad  Con: Horrible skillet Mac n cheese with smoked meats. Tasted like cheese whiz and they used scraps of fatty meats. I took most of it home thinking I was just too full and I would add more/better cheese. Then it became more apparent that the meat was all fat. Disgusting.  Con: This place is way over priced for what you get."}
{"text":"Okay deli food.  Awesome location.  Nice renovations.  Good for groups.  Slow service.  Slow food.  Big portions."}
{"text":"Our first stop for our Montreal weekend. Dropped by Friday after midnight and they warmly welcomed us, waiter was very professional and quick. Lets just say this is our first meal this revisit, and one of our best!  We ordered the smoked meat \"chop-chop poutine\" and their smoked meat 10oz sandwich which was humongous and came with a boatload of fries and a small cup of coleslaw along with a large half pickle. If you imagine Schwartsz but 3x the size of one, then that's how big Reubens smoked meat sandwich was. Not only the size but the taste was phenomenal, for both dishes (poutine was huge as well). Curds were good, gravy was spread evenly, and the smoked meat on the sandwich and on the poutine were a blast of flavour.  Love that they were open late so that we were able to walk here hungry from our hotel nearby and enjoy a magnificent meal!"}
{"text":"Wow... Fast service! Friendly staff that take good care of you and the food was amazing! We ordered the super fanous smoked meat sandwich and the roast beef sliders. The sliders bourbon mayo sauce was to die for! The portion of food was great! Too full for dessert. Will definitely check this place out again, especially for dessert."}
{"text":"Nice place not only to have a smoke meat but a Cacciatore Chicken. Think of sharing a plate as they dishes are really huge!!! Deserts are also nice, convenient place with late hours, so if you are hungry after watching a movie at the theater close by and want a quick service and nice meal, you definitely won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"My friend and I decided to have an early dinner at Reubens and we enjoyed it. I had the honey glazed salmon with mashed potatoes and veggies. The salmon was juicy and the mashed potato was very good. My friend had the steak and she also enjoyed her meal. The service was quick despite it being fairly packed. We went on an early Saturday evening and when we left there was a long line so keep that in mind. The desserts looked so good but we were in a deep food coma from how much we ate. The only downside to eating here is the level of noise. It got pretty loud and my friend and I were speaking in raised voices to hear each other. But apart from that it was an enjoyable experience. Will definitely return to have some of their cakes along with the tasty meals."}
{"text":"The smoke meat ain't that bad here. Ya can't compare it to Katz deli - it wouldn't be fair - it's different. Tell ya what though, I wouldn't want to wait in line like the rest of the other chumps at the other place.   Chumpssssss....."}
{"text":"When I was a student I used to eat here every week religiously. My arteries paid for it but it was a lot of fun. It's a good place to hang out and just soak up the atmosphere. Sure there's better smoke meat elsewhere, Reuben's is just a fun place to be."}
{"text":"Everything was good. Quick service, nice food, location. Smoked meat is their speciality although you can find some other alternatives. A must try restaurant when in Montreal."}
{"text":"Tourist trap.  I let the high reviews here, trick me into coming.  Terrible food, and its so overpriced."}
{"text":"Food was good, service was terrible. We went mid afternoon. It wasn't overly busy. Empty drinks were ignored by our waiter, we were finished our meal for 10 min before he stopped by to take any dishes . Said he'd get our cheque. He didn't  ask us if we wanted dessert, and honestly by this time I was getting annoyed. Then he went back to chatting up the girl at the cash register. We sat there for 13 min( I timed it because I was amazed at the bad service ) waiting for him to quit visiting the gal at the front and bring the cheque.  We went elsewhere for dessert and more drinks. As a first time patron I was very disappointed. It's a beautiful restaurant, but a waiter like that isn't going to do anything to bring repeat business."}
{"text":"3 years in a row I've been making sure to stop at this place for either lunch or dinner..  Their chop-chop poutine is a must to have.  Now, I do love the smoked meat, but for me, to have it on the poutine is almost enough.  The french onion soup is my god good.  The sandwiches, well, they just make them amazing.  This is another place that is a staple stop on my yearly trip up to Montreal, almost wish they weren't so far away and I could have them every day."}
{"text":"We return here every in June when we are in town, we have lunch or dinner, and take away a huge slap of smoked meat to take home (love their smoked meat!!).  The food is good and decent size proportions.  There was a downfall this trip in the drink I ordered.  I asked for a gin martini, straight up.  I don't know what it was - way too much vermouth or just a bad concoction?  They handled my asking to return it with no problem and I ordered something else.    We also love this place because it's very close to our hotel.  And I love the old diner ambiance  mixed with all the photos displayed.  It's a must visit on our trip!"}
{"text":"So here's the thing, the service was AMAZING. The food was just average for what I've been getting in Montreal though. We initially wanted to go to one of their affiliate restaurants and got redirected here, but it was too Americanized for what we wanted. If you want an authentic Montreal experience look elsewhere."}
{"text":"Try the Original Reuben smoked meat sandwich. Would recommend sandwiches, but the fries leave more to be desired - frozen flavorless shoe strings. Excellent atmosphere and service."}
{"text":"Great downtown spot, great customer service and open later for late owls like myself.    First meal in Montreal and I order the large smoked sandwich, I was going to order it with a poutine appetizer but the bartender kindly told me to just switch the fries to poutine instead and it was a wish choice because the amount of food was enough to feed two people.  The sandwich was massive, the smoked meat was really good, the overall experience of the sandwich was really good.  The poutine was ok, not that flavorful.  They have beers too, so the experience was really good, a ittle pricey yes but overall a great meal."}
{"text":"Delicious food and very fast service. The only downfall is that it is very pricey, but I guess you do get very large portions. I think it was like $70 or something for 2 sandwiches and 2 beers at lunch time."}
{"text":"Oh my meaty goodness. In Montreal for the weekend and this was one of our best meals. Eric had the smoked meat, I had a steak sandwich that was one of the best I've ever had and Celeste had an excellent burger. We all had leftovers which we ate in the morning for breakfast. It was expensive but so worth it...the next time someone from Montreal tells me that NYC is soooo expensive, I am afraid I will have to laugh in their face."}
{"text":"Since coming across Reuben's on one of my visits to Montreal almost a year ago, it's become a regular spot for me for a fantastic meal. It never disappoints. The staff is friendly and attentive. The ambiance is casual yet still you can still find a romantic table. I've never had a bad meal here"}
{"text":"First time I came here for a quick bite and I loved it! Food and the service. This is my second time here and I must say they're definitely consistent. I had the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta which was soooo good. Flavourful and served hot and fresh! Taste like it was literally cooked from scratch while we're waiting! And because their portions are hefty I opted out of dessert, but let me tell you guys that this place is cheese-cake HEAVEN!!! 5 stars Reuben's!!!"}
{"text":"Great poutine fries with gravy and cheese chunks. Best smoked beef with secret sauce and cheese sandwich. Strawberry cheesecake a-ok. Service very good. Nice place. Good crowd in 30s. Confortable seating."}
{"text":"Loved the smoked meat! Order anything with smoked meat in it and you know it will be amazing.  We were here for lunch on boxing day and the place was packed. Even so, we were seated right away. The moment we sat down, we placed an order of the smoked meat poutine and it did not disappoint. The meat was so flavorful and well seasoned. After that, we continued our meal with more smoked meat by getting the famous super sandwiches and sliders. The best part was we were able to turn our side of fries into side of poutine. You can never go wrong with more poutine.   The brisket was so tender and marbled with good amount of fat. It had a good pepper flavor without being overwhelming. I could just  eat pounds and pounds of the meat by itself.   We also tried the bbq short rib poutine but it was just okay. I was not the biggest fan of the bbq sauce. Wanting to venture out of the smoked meat dishes, I got the prime rib beef sandwich as well. It was a little lackluster. It was bland and dry.   Overall, it was a great meal. I highly recommend sticking to what they are well known for, which is the smoked meat!"}
{"text":"Reuben's is a busy place with good food. Their smoked meat was melt-in-your-mouth good. I would liken it to pastrami, maybe a little different. The service was prompt, and they were packed. Good beer selection to accompany your smoked meat. they have an IPL (India Pale Lager) on tap that goes great with your sandwich. If you like IPAs, try an IPL."}
{"text":"Great food but poor service. Waiter took forever to come take our order. Also, it was a bit later at night so everyone was focused on cleaning and closing up. Got a double bloody Cesar and it was the same price as my meal 17.99$. I dont remember the prices being this high for drinks and i have to admit i was a little shocked to see my bill. I won't be returning anytime soon."}
{"text":"The food was amazing along with the dessert. We sat by the window so we got a great view of the exciting street! Caramel Carrot Cake Cheesecake was great!"}
{"text":"Near our hotel and was recommended by the hotelier.  I had the classic Reuben sand-witch ( a little salty).  Fries were perfectly fried.  My friend had the Roast beef swiss (need a little salt LOL)  We both split the sandwitch.   Portion is big so FYI.  Seating and atmosphere was good."}
{"text":"Massive portions here at reubens. The \"Super\"  smoke meat sandwich is 10oz of smoke meat. I had the bread toasted with a slice of Swiss. Just excellent. The meat is sliced super thin and is more tender than Schwartz. Flavor wise it's more salty so it's better you eat it with something than just plain meat. Different experience but definitely still good. Sandwich also comes with fries and slaw. I prefer the slaw here as it's not too watery compared to Schwartz.   Wait was a tad long for the food to arrive considering it's just a sandwich."}
{"text":"My husband was in Pastrami heavenwhat a fun place for lunch... great menu, attentive staff.  A must visit when in Montreal"}
{"text":"Food portion sizes that are offered by Reuben's are exceptionally big & reasonably priced for a downtown restaurant venue. Considering the location to St. Catherines Avenue & the ton of other restaurants, boutiques and shopping venues, expect at least a 25% markup on prices. But like most downtown areas anywhere in the world, this is expected. No big deal.  No major issues with the food. My wife & I wanted to eat something light, so we chose a pepperoni flatbread that was more of a reluctant choice more than anything else. We originally wanted the flatbread that had the green peppers and mushrooms. When I requested that the flatbread have the mushrooms on one side and the pepperoni on the other, our server indicated that the kitchen staff would \"freak out\" if they saw our request. Are you serious? I almost wanted to ask the server if this would take an additional 10 seconds out of their busy day to accommodate this request, yet I held back in saying so. Meanwhile, a server at the table adjacent to us took a request to add something with their poutine entree. Of course, you hear some loud hoots & hollering within the kitchen from the kitchen staff possibly in protest due to a slightly different poutine variety.   Other than the kitchen staff having feelings toward requests from the restaurant's patrons, Reuben's is a pretty good place. 4 stars for the venue's presentation, 4 stars for the server's promptness and etiquette, yet 2 stars for the kitchen staff being way too sensitive in accepting requests (or somewhat lack thereof) from paying customers.  Nonetheless, I would return to Reuben's. Just have to do so with an empty stomach. They will fill you up to the eyeballs in good food."}
{"text":"Mega portions, absolutely NO room for dessert. Love their Southern chicken crisp salad even if it takes me forever to finish it. Burgers are also monster- sized, usually slathered in various sauces and topped with cheese to boot! Those who want/have to watch their weight/waists, beware."}
{"text":"Our server was excellent, Raya. She knew we were trying to drink a lot of water (to stay hydrated) so she refilled them a lot. She recommended things to us and gave us honest opinions on the food. Big fan she's dope"}
{"text":"Reuben's is a fun place! It has a huge menu with something for everyone! The service is top notch and the atmosphere is hip and cool. The reuben sandwich is huge and something special to behold. The dijon chicken strips were delicious as well. The only downside is that everything is fairly expensive. So, if you are looking for a budget friendly meal this is not it. But if you are willing to splurge on excellent sandwiches and a fabulous dining experience, this is it!"}
{"text":"This place is si authentic! My American cousin loved their smoke meat poutine. I like this place alot"}
{"text":"The food selection and dessert here is amazing! Definitely a must!! And the location is great as it allows you to bar hop right after a good dinner"}
{"text":"Five star restaurants don't have to be expensive and serve fancy food, they need to be great at what they intended to be.  Well, Ruben's holds itself out as a Deli and they are a GREAT deli.  A group of us spent three days in Montreal.  We tried it for lunch and loved the deli sandwiches.  We returned for breakfast and loved that too (much more than some of the older and more famous Quebec delis).  Please open a restaurant in St. Louis."}
{"text":"Lovely restaurant! The food was delicious! I had a smoked sandwich(that was to die) for with a side of French fries. The meal itself was well presented and obviously delicious. My boyfriend had the tribes, which was the most delicious Reuben we have ever tried. Seriously, order the Reuben!   The decor of the restaurant was awesome. It had a mural of different aspects of life in Montreal. The light were dim and made the restaurant feel very cozy. The music was a bit odd they were playing top 40 hits. I think they could do a bit better with the music selection.   The service was good. We had a very nice waiter who was funny and sweet. He made sure we felt comfortable and was very relatable. He took a bit long to give us our check and forgot our drinks, but I can't blame him; the restaurant is very busy most of the time."}
{"text":"The restaurant is in a good location and has a nice ambience, but the food was mediocre and the service was terrible.  Our food arrived a good 10 minutes before our drinks did.  The waiter was aloof, unresponsive, and didn't seem to pay attention to what we were asking.  We each had the original smoked meat sandwich which was rather disappointing for the both of us.  If you like lean rather uncooked meat but doesn't have much flavor, have a try.   We will leave this Montreal sandwich to the people here."}
{"text":"This is my favourite place in Montreal to go for smoked meat sandwiches. The service is always great and the food is amazing!  I always stop by when I'm in town. It's great for the whole family and the location couldn't be better."}
{"text":"First off, we read all the reviews and decided to give this place a try during lunch. The location is a bit chaotic and crowded but luckily we made it in just before the lunch rush.   We were seated and began by moving our seats again simply out of comfort. We were pushed into a corner and felt awkward. The interior is alright, it's clean and well lit, really unsure what the style or theme is? The floors are atrocious and dirty though!   The hostess was quite nice and warm, the waitress on the other hand.. Really rude and uninterested. We ordered our drinks and it came within 15 mins. At this point the lunch rush rolled in....  The food was terribly meh, the burger had no flavor at all. I can't fathom the prices for this dive quantity food. Mind you, we ordered cocktails -- half the drink was missing. When we asked why there was so little, she said that's how it comes. No it really isn't. Soda refills aren't free. What? Is that a joke? That is just mind-boggling. Do they realize it costs like 80 cents for the mixture ?! We got water instead. How embarrassing!   It took the waitress so much time to bring us the check, my father fell asleep. Truly! I've never felt so uncomfortable and betrayed after spending this much money. I was disgusted to even leave a tip, but felt obligated as a human being.   My advice, have better service and more flavorful food. I think the sandwich my mother had (NY Steak) was probably the only liked meal. Again, so overpriced and such a rude staff."}
{"text":"I just had dinner at Reubin's and it was my very first visit. Dinner was fabulous!   But the portions are huge so beware of this before you order! The waitress was patient at helping me navigate the menu. The service was fast but not rushed. I was glad I went early 17:00 as when I left around 18:15 there was a line out the door. My friend Alexa says there are other restaurants that also do great corn beef. But needless to say I can't wait to go back to Montreal and enjoy dinner chez Reubin's!"}
{"text":"The Reuben poutine was absolutely fantastic! Regular poutine topped with their melt-in-your-mouth smoked meat. Their mango daiquiri was a good size, tasted great, and worth the price.   The waiter was really nice to me, however the host didn't seem to have time for me (or maybe she was just quite busy).   It felt a bit too fancy for someone looking for a bite to eat after a long day of shopping and wearing a t-shirt and leggings, but I still had no problems."}
{"text":"Overall, the food was very good.  Large portions and beautifully presented.  We ordered the crispy chicken salad and Reuben sandwich.    Also, save room for dessert!  The cakes are colossal.  Try the strawberry cheesecake and red velvet."}
{"text":"Gah, I hate being the odd man out, but my experience at Reuben's could have been better. Maybe it's because I was using it as a point of comparison to Schwartz's (http://www.yelp.com/biz/schwartzs-montr%C3%A9al-2?hrid=Q8flys8gSE-nfufggVNbfA#src:self), but I can't quite say with confidence that a trip to Reuben's is worth going out of your way.   Star 1: How were the service and atmosphere?  Now, one thing I will say is that Reuben's is designed to funnel large quantities of people even on the busiest of days. You're sitting here in the most touristy part of town, so you're already in the zone for a crowd, but Reuben's will have you seated quickly. The menu? Colossal, and even the most picky eaters will find something that suits them. In my case, the bartender was pleasant and attentive without being overbearing. Star Granted.   Star 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?  Sure, my smoked meat sandwich at nearby Schwartz's was half the cost of my $16.00 smoked meat sandwich here at Reuben's, but it was also half the sandwich. Have a look at this beast:  http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=OKX-V5j_qfuOebeHeWGrHg&select=PNYh4OrGamAwGQiZsHlyyA  That's easily two sandwiches and two portions of fries. For $16.00? That's fair. Star Granted.   Stars 3 and 4: How was the food?  And herein came the problem. Reuben's can do it all, as is evident by their menu, but what that often leads to is everything being done not quite to the optimal standard. Case in point was my sandwich, which, to be honest, wasn't all that good. The smoked meat must have been slow cooked in a crock pot as opposed to smoked because the whole thing was so overcooked that it fell apart into a bit of a salty mush. Combined with standard bread, standard, boring fries, and a pickle, and I honestly wasn't too keen to the point where I didn't even finish the meal. Up the quality of the meat, up the quality of the bread, and up the quality of the fries, and you'd have a brilliant sandwich. In the meantime? I wasn't a fan. No Stars Granted.   Star 5: Would you eat here every day if you could?  Schwartz's is better head to toe when it comes to smoked meat sandwiches. No Star Granted."}
{"text":"Everything I've tried at Ruben's is much better than I expected and the prices are very good for the quality."}
{"text":"3 Stars for the crappy welcome and shuffling of us from a window booth that was free into the main aisle where all of the servers walk by. Maybe they didn't like my Jays cap and Foo Fighters T-shirt. Oh well maybe they will redeem themselves with the food!"}
{"text":"Good smoked meat - brisket. They have an appetizer that is delicious- brisket on top of poutine. Lots of food, though. We only had two appetizers and a salad and that was more than enough food. They have a great desert selection as well."}
{"text":"Top notch food and service. Delmonico steak sandwich was one of the best I have ever had..."}
{"text":"Super nice place; a little on the expensive side but worth it for the atmosphere. If you hate greasy poutine this is the place to get it! The fries are nice and crunchy and don't feel like they've been dipped in oil. In fact, you can get the poutine with smoked meat on top which is another Montreal must-try, and it's absolutely delicious! I've had both the chop-chop (smoked meat) and the pulled pork poutine. Both are great, though if you have to choose one, I'd say go for the smoked meat.   I've also had the cheesecake, which they say is \"Montreal-style\"... it's a bit more fluffy than typical cheesecake; worth a taste but very difficult to fit if you've had any of their huge main dishes!"}
{"text":"This is the first place I ate in Montreal and the best. My boyfriend and I shared the smoked meat poutine to start. He had the smoked meat sandwich afterwards and I had the turkey melt. The portions were huge and just great. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Sweet mother of God. So much meat...excellent food. Touristy as it gets but excellent quality..get dessert. Helpful staff, polite and courteous! Great stuff 9/10 (only losing points for being tourist hell)"}
{"text":"We came here probably 30 minutes before closing. This was a last resort. I got a Cobb salad, which was coated in mayo based dressing. It was so sweet that it was nauseating. So I ate the alfalfa, cheese, tomato, And turkey instead.   The BLAT was nothing to write home about. Hubby ate half and decided to stop and wait for breakfast instead.   The service was very hurried and still slower than expected. Maybe we are just too used to fast paced places, where they give a time frame and it's on time or sooner.   Over all, very disappointing and too much of an American restaurant in Montreal."}
{"text":"Not quite sure why it get's these rave reviews. I have had Reuben's all my life from NYC deli's to local diner's and on several different continents.    this was by far  the worst tasting Reuben I have ever had. It tasted like lunch meat, there was no sourkraut and only 1/2 slice of cheese on a slab of toasted black bread Hubby ordered pastrami/ Corn beef on Rye. Not sure what that was but there was only 1 type if meat on the sandwich. Our daughter ordered Chicken Parmigiana, the chicken was grilled?! As we where leaving we asked if there was a Elevator since my husband is handicap and could not possible walk up those stairs, we where directed to a elevator that wound up being a service elevator. After hitting every floor {4} we wound up leaving through a loading dock with all the trash, BTW 30 minutes after we ate hubby got sick, with a bad case of diarrhea."}
{"text":"Great smoked meat sandwich - had the 10 oz version. Ask for juicy/moist as the sandwich is crazy juicy then. I upgraded fries to poutine. Was ok but not stellar. Fries were typical fast food and not high end blanched nor double fried. Service was fast and friendly."}
{"text":"Generally I'd go some other place a lot more famous for smoked meat but this time tried to find something different. And I was not disappointed at all.  Found some easy parking in Rue Sainte-Catherine and it was pretty cheap too. Strolled in and got a seat immediately.  Order one sandwich and it was amazing. Really hit the spot. The decor itself kinda felt dated. It may be the look they are going for, while it wasn't uncomfortable, it was very brown decor.  I'd definitely come back, no wait trumps."}
{"text":"I and a party of six others dined at the Reuben's location just west of Peel Street on Saint Catherine on a Tuesday evening. The place was packed. The waiter who served us was an exceptional, polite and informative young man who knew the menu inside-out. My personal opinion was that this was the highlight of the dining experience.  For starters we ordered our beverages and I received a Coca Cola that was flat. This was a harbinger of the meal to come which I would describe as fair to middling. The meal that I chose from the menu was the Famous Super Sandwich. The meal included the classic Reuben's smoked meat sandwich of 10 ounces of smoked meat on rye bread with mustard.  As well, there was a coleslaw with dill pickle and French fries for the price of $16.99.  While the smoked meat sandwich was OK I did not appreciate the French fries. These were nothing more than McCain's frozen French fries, the kind that one finds in McDonald's restaurants. I found that this cheapened the plate and would have preferred a different cut of fries. Overall the dining experience was OK. Finally, the location of this establishment is reflected in their meal prices which seemed to be somewhat overpriced for this type of restaurant and meal."}
{"text":"The smoked meats melt in your mouth.  Huge portions.  And you can't stop eating it even when you are full."}
{"text":"i came recently to grab a smoked meat sandwich.. despite having an awesome pastrami sandwich in new york recently.. my buddy was hankering for a meat sandwich..   the pastrami was thick, moist and tender..  however.. it could have been piled a bit higher..   overall.. it's not bad.. but it's not something i would come back and have again"}
{"text":"Wonderful experience for my first visit to Montreal. Prompt service with wonderful offerings. I ordered the steak sandwich with a salad and the sandwich was my best bite in the city."}
{"text":"Upscale deli with a cool vibe. Had the \"Rubin Special\" and it was great especially with a side of poutine!"}
{"text":"Great early morning (6-9)breakfast special The food was yummy  Omelets my favorite !  The customer service was wonderful!! Management was also respectful and accommodating"}
{"text":"Was recommended by hotel,  and stopped by prior to going to cirque de soleil.  Healthy portions, reasonable price, and the service great.  Smoked meat was really good coming from a New Yorker, went with a platter rather than tge sandwich to avoid the bread, but still stuffed.  Walk back to your hotel rather than the Metro just to walk it off.  Will go again."}
{"text":"Didn't want to make the trip up to Schwartz, so I dove head first into Reuben for some take out. First the good: The smoked sandwich was fantastic! Great flavor! Now the not so good: When I entered, the hosts (2) were so busy talking to three guys who happen to be pro football players. One handed me a menu and I asked about the famous smoked sandwich and she looked at me as if I had two heads. I finally found it on the menu then ordered. Then a gentleman, who might've been management/owner and the woman at the cashier joined the kids in their fandom. Long story short: they didn't place my order. They were too busy 'ass-kissing' and not paying attention to their day-to-day patrons. Finally got my sandwich and they apologized but by that time, I was turned-off. I'll give Reuben's the benefit of the doubt on this one however, please, do not ignore and pay lip service to your customers regardless of fame or not."}
{"text":"Montreal smoked meat at its finest. Staff is attentive and friendly. Place is always packed but you manage to eat well.  Updated review: If you're vegan, there are options for you too.  This is a carnivore lover's dream. Long Live the Smoked Meat."}
{"text":"Really nice place for late lunch with family. We came here with 9 Adults & 4 kids. We were a hungry party. They got us in on time , everyone got the food really fast & the order they wanted. Really enjoyed the atmosphere & food. Really good staff, nice & friendly. Very understanding & accommodating, especially when you have kids. Nice casual place to hang out family. Would recommend to any one looking for good Montreal smoked meat place."}
{"text":"I sometimes eat breakfast here when in Montreal.  My experience has been that the food is consistently good.  The thing that keeps me coming back, though, is the incredible service.  Hostesses, waiters, and waitresses are always extremely friendly and efficient.  I always leave here not only fuller, but happier."}
{"text":"We stopped at Reuben's for lunch, noticing it was a popular lunch spot on our walk throughout downtown. We quickly get seated, the restaurant is busy but the hostess and waiters are all very attentive and speedy. We ordered off the business lunch menu - the original 76 (brisket sandwich with a side of fries, coleslaw and a pickle) as well as this chop chop poutine, which is shavings of brisket over poutine. The food was incredible- so much flavor and nothing too salty. I almost never finish a meal and this one I did! Cannot wait to go back!"}
{"text":"So after disappointed that Kazu was closed for the rest of July, me and my boyfriend decided to hit up this joint. Who even goes to Montreal for sushi anyways? Smoked meat is where's it's at and Reuben's has it.   I've also been to Schwartz before, but this place does the mouth and tummy just right too if you're closer downtown.   The sandwiches generally come with coleslaw, a pickle, and fries which were decent. But the sandwich itself is a monster. In taste and portion.   Smoked Meat Sandwich (the famous one) : I have no clue how they managed to stuff so much meat in there and still cut it in half.. Now that takes skill. And the meat itself was glooooorious, especially for a meat person like me.    Tuna Melt:  This was also really, REALLY good. The cheese just melts on the tuna with a slice of tomato inside, it was just heavenly.   The service is also amazing here. You get greeted by beautiful hostesses and our server was lovely and attentive.   It is a bit on the pricey side, but it's downtown Montreal so comeon.   PS. During our visit, there was an elder woman sitting alone, picking at her plate a piece of chicken at a time. Many of servers seemed very friendly to her so I took it she was a regular. At the end of her meal, the servers all surprised her with a cake on the house because i believe was her birthday. It was one of the cutest things I've seen, and for that this restaurant deserves much more than a 5/5. You guys are amazing!"}
{"text":"My husband and I came here for the famous smoke meat. We ordered a skillet and an omelette with smoke neat but there are just a few meat in our dish. The potion is big but a little too much oily for us. Quite disappointed with the breakfast here!"}
{"text":"This is a large restaurant in downtown that boasts a cool vibe and professional wait staff. The desserts looked totally off the hook but I didn't partake during the lunch hour.  The smoked meats reminded me of my other experience at Schwartz's, which was positive. The helpings were extremely generous but half way through the sandwich I got bored of the flavor and texture. The bread was perfect but the sandwich overall felt like it was lacking something. The fries were great and I was not thinking I would eat them all but after I tried them I finished all of it. Overall I just thought it was okay and just solidified my opinion of my previous experience.  I am sure they have some other great items because I really liked the restaurant and the desserts look so awesome!"}
{"text":"God, I hate to be a buzzkill but this place isn't very good.  After descending the gaudy mirror and wood paneled stairs, I thought for sure I'd end up in some wannabe Mafioso's love nest only to be met by even more fabulous ridiculous interior design. This place has to be seen to be believed. Deliberate irony is the only defense.  We had fabulous service from a gentleman from Afganistan who while making our sandwiches discussed his feelings about the state of the world. He was fantastic - interesting to listen to and just so passionate about serving us what he felt was the best meat in Montreal. It so pains me that I ended up so disappointed with this place.  My companion and I split both their famous Reuben and their 'classic' smoked meat sandwich. It likely goes without saying that the portions here are simply huge and a great bang for the buck is certainly to be had, at least as volume is concerned. The meat is piled stupidly high on the sandwiches making them near impossible to fit in your mouth. Don't even think about calorie counting.  The meat does, as other people mentioned, melt in your mouth. Despite a rather strong smell that some complained was a tad on the foul side (it comes with the curing), it did taste good and had what I thought was an unusual amount of coriander flavor to it. But for the most part it tasted exactly like an average corned beef - absolutely no evidence of the smoking that others seem so convinced makes this place and Montreal meats so unique.  It didn't help that the bread wasn't that great and quickly melted and fell apart, that the mustard lacked any kick, that the Russian dressing was devoid of tang, and that the sauerkraut was actually pretty gross. And I freaking love sauerkraut in all of its stages of carefully controlled rotting goodness.  The fries were mooshy and flavorless. Having worked a frialator in a past life, I would have been ashamed to serve these to anyone. Even my gravest of enemies.  I also know from working a frialator that churning out good fries isn't hard it just requires paying attention.  Other people's reviews make it clear: this place is all about the \"unique\" meat. The meat shines, above all else but that's because everything else was...well, bad. This is my honest assessment: I completely fail to see the uniqueness of this place and its product versus a traditionally prepared corned beef.  When the other aspects of your meal are taken into account the experience is average at best. It is also completely devoid of any locals. I have some theories.  Can we also be clear here? Corned beef is cured in brine NOT smoked. My rudimentary understanding of physics also dictates that smoke doesn't do anything to submerged objects such as meat. If you watch your sandwich being made the meat is removed from a vat of steaming brine (liquid clearly visible). So unless the meat here goes through some baffling process of curing, smoking and curing again this is just your regular everyday corned beef - which is what it tastes like.   I am doubtful smoking makes up any significant portion of the process, if at all, and even if it does none of the signs of smoking are present in the meat we were served (e.g smoky flavor, color, textural qualities).  So go here if you want to be surrounded by tourists, have a dining experience with heaps of mediocre food and just OKAY corned beef that pretentiously claims to be more than it is. Next time I'm going to try Schwartz's."}
{"text":"This is a wonderful restaurant!!!! The food is absolutely amazing and the portions are awesome as well!! We came for dinner one night and we had an appetizer, two main courses, and one dessert with a few drinks and our total bill came to 120 CAD dollars before tip. Which is awesome especially for this area. The service is fast and friendly accommodating for both French and English speakers. Both of our waiters and waitresses were more than helpful with our questions of the menu and helped us decide what to get.  All around Reubens is a fantastic restaurant that isn't just a deli. If I could rate this more than five stars I would.  Sincerely Kevin"}
{"text":"We came to Reuben's Deli & Steaks for breakfast. The decor has a retro-70s theme with jukeboxes near the bar. Service was excellent - very friendly :)  DRINKS: Hot chocolate with whipped cream Orange juice Coffee  GRILLED CHEESE (4/5) (A single-decker sandwich loaded with melted cheddar cheese.) This was so yummy - cheesy heaven! Came with crispy potato wedges on the side.  THE R.D. SKILLET (4/5) (Sautéed onions, sauerkraut, melted Swiss cheese and slices of Montreal Smoked Meat.) The smoked meat was very tasty :P The portions are huge, more like a dinner during breakfast time for us.. You will be stuffed!!"}
{"text":"Its a nice place. The \"The Original\" comes on a bun with coleslaw, fries and a pickle. The smacked meat was okay. I think because I am used to New York style pastrami I want in love. It was good and my friend really enjoy it, I just thought it was okay. Waitress was extremely nice and serviceable. The place was clean and I enjoyed my meal."}
{"text":"The smoked meat poutine was amazing. I think the smoked meat at Schwarz is better, but it doesn't have the nicer, more formal ambience and a truly impressive wine list. I had to ask the lovely waitress to bring me back the wine menu so I could write down the name of the wine I ordered because I liked it so much. If you're looking for smoked meat in a very nice sit-down setting, Reuben's is great."}
{"text":"Rueben's is a family favorite and we take all our first time Montreal visiting relatives here. They have good burgers and steaks, the portions are quite reasonable. It is a bit toward the pricey side and the biggest drawback would be the waiting time. Try going there a bit earlier if you don't have a reservation or you have a big group.  Their desserts aren't the best, I found their cake to be dry.   The service is a good and we always have an overall amazing time at Rueben's.  I would definitely recommend this place to Montreal first timers."}
{"text":"I love smoked meat and love ordering the builder's platter at Reubens. That way, I get more meat and less bread to deal with. Their coleslaw is one of my favorites and I always enjoy the fries that come with the smoked meat plates. The ambiance is semi casual and the location is right on st Catherine street near a lot of downtown action. Love this place."}
{"text":"This place is named after the person who invented the Reuben sandwich.  Technically, the founder worked over at Schwartz's where the lines are long.  But there are many fine smoked beef establishments in Montreal including this one. Eating in any of the top twenty will get you something decent.  At smoked beef places, do your ordering with care, even if everything is going to be good.  What is the issue?  This more than any restaurant I know is a \"combo\" restaurant rather than a pure ingredient restaurant.  Normally, I am a straight ingredient kind of a guy.  I like straight steak, straight pastrami, straight whiskey, no ice, no mixers.  That is NOT how Reuben's is designed and for good reason.  One of the differences between a Montreal smoked beef and an American/Irish corned beef -   is that Montreal beef is dry cooked rather than boiled.  This means that more of the brining chemicals stay in Montreal smoked beef than you get with the American/Irish corned beef  Nothing boils out into water.  This gives Montreal deli an excellent taste but a very strong taste.  A Reuben sandwich is a distinct local solution to the highly flavored meat.  By combining smoked meat with sauerkraut, swiss cheese and bread, you give some complementary flavors to balance out the brine.   WITH the trimmings, the sandwich is perfectly balanced and a delight.  Without the trimmings, it is a stronger raw-er commitment.  Related principles apply to their chopped liver.  They do an excellent chopped liver.  But since the restaurant thinks in combos -  they combine the chopped liver with WONDERFUL WONDERFUL caramelized fried onions.  Both ingredients are good by themselves.  But the whole is greater than the sum of the parts -  and a mouthful of BOTH onions and liver is definitely better than a mouthful of onions followed by a mouthful of liver.  So dilute things down, mix and match and build those combos.  Reuben's is a place where flavors work in teams."}
{"text":"We stumbled upon Reuben's while walking from our hotel. We wanted a place that was casual and quick - and this was it! We sat at the bar because it was available and we were famished. The bartender was super friendly and helpful. I ordered the 3 sliders and my husband ordered a giant sandwich. They both had corned beef on them, essentially the same sandwich in a different shape, but both were great. I especially loved the seasoned chips; the fries were good too. My only reason for not giving 5* is because the rolls & the rye bread were not amazing and that was a little disappointing. I don't eat grain, so I don't normally eat the bun/bread anyway. I'm a tough carb critic! Otherwise we will be back!"}
{"text":"If you come to Montreal, have the \"famous super sandwich \" ! Stacked smoked meat with mustard. Swiss cheese is extra , but it just rounds off this meatlovers delicacy very nicely! The coleslaw in Montreal seems to be quite sweet. Friendly staff. Pierre-Olivier was our waiter; funny guy and very attentive ! The only sore spot I think was the fries and lack of sweet potatoes fries option."}
{"text":"A really really good reuben, which is to be expected based on the name. A delicious bloody caesar. AND the portions were huge. A lovely wait staff and fun music :) I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Love coming here every Time we're  in Montreal. Superb service situated along St. Catherine's so when your done eating go SHOPPING Walk up and down checking out all the little overpriced shops and try to find a Quebecois who is willing to speak to you in English. Then work off the calories from that massive slice of cheesecake by window shopping up and down the Avenue. Reuben's never disappoints, but I've noticed  sandwiches are smaller and prices are much higher. Also parking is always a problem, and the Quebecois are horrid drivers."}
{"text":"Every time I am in Montreal I make my way to Reuben's! It is worth every penny. I usually go with another person and end up slipping a few things. We usually split the Ruben sandwich, which is HUGE, and then windup slipping the chocolate cake. This restaurant is a can't miss when in Montreal!"}
{"text":"Reuben's is a must on every Montreal visit now. Melt in the mouth meat on great bread with stringy fries."}
{"text":"Jared and I needed breakfast--stat. It was cold and windy, and most of the restaurants we were interested in did not open early enough for us. We stumbled into a mostly-empty Reuben's and sat down to eat.  We both got coffee, and I ordered a ham, egg, and cheese on rye, which came with a generous portion of home fries (seasoned with a lot of rosemary, I think). Although it wasn't their signature smoked meat, the sandwich overall was hefty and tasted great.  This restaurant (I hesitate to call it a \"deli\" due to the rather small meat counter) serves some good food, and gets really crowded later in the morning once people are ready to eat. You might have a wait if you come at the end of the breakfast rush, despite the size of the space."}
{"text":"Elevated deli restaurant with pretty good dishes. Although I prefer the meatier taste of Katz's Deli, the smoked meat is pretty good. I like the set up (comfortable setting) and quick service. The Reuben is great. Pass on the Reuben spaghetti. Smoked meat sandwich is great. I want to try the chopped liver next time."}
{"text":"Had dinner here on a Saturday night at 5pm with a bachelor party group of 12. They were able to accommodate us without a reservation and fit us in on a nice long table.  Ordered two styles of poutine for the table, both were very good. Sandwiches and burgers were all very good from what our party said. The different smoked meats were great and the size of each sandwich was very larger. Everyone loved it. Servers did a nice job as well with checking in on us and handling all the payments. Would definitely go back to try some other menu choices."}
{"text":"I visit Rueben's once a year when my dad and I visit Montreal to go see a hockey game. Every year this is our dinner of choice before the game. It has never let us down. We usually order burgers or sandwiches since we are in a hurry to get to the game, and we are always served in a timely manner with a large portioned meal. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Just came from lunch...service was great...my wife and I shared a small sandwich and onion rings. Oh and yes...amazing cheesecake. Will be back this trip!!"}
{"text":"The concierge at my hotel, Omni Mont-Royal, suggested Reuben's since I didn't want to make the trek to Schwartz's. I made a good choice because the classic smoked meat sandwich was Excellent! I highly recommend Reuben's... man I wish we could get smoked meat in San Diego or LA"}
{"text":"Nous nous sommes rendus au Reuben's après un concert au Centre Bell, affamés pour du bon Smoked Meat! Notre serveur Olivier était clairement dans le jus (c'était bondé à 21:30 un mercredi soir) mais a bien prit le temps de nous saluer, de nous offrir des verres d'eau, de nous apporter une bière en fût et de répondre à nos questions sur le menu.  J'étais un peu déçue qu'il n'y ait pas l'option Pinte pour la bière, mais bon, c'est pas bein bein grave.  Parlons bouffe. Alex a prit la traditionnelle assiette de sandwich au smoked meat. Moi, j'ai suivi les conseils d'Olivier, en optant pour le sandwich Reuben's Original. Découverte in-cro-yable! Non mais sans farces, du smoked meat tranché mince, roulé, grillé avec du fromage suisse fondant, une petite choucroute à la sauce Mille-îles sur du pain pumpernickel grillé. Oh que WoW et re-wow. Quand Alex y a goûté, bien que son sandwich était vraiment bon, il a un peu regretté son choix.  Les deux assiettes étaient servies avec une généreuse portions de frites juliennes (perso je les ai trouvé ordinaires), une petite salade de chou et un quartier de cornichon.  Petit bémol pour les toilettes qui manquent peut-être un peu d'attention par l'équipe de ménage :/  Super experience overall, j'ai déjà hâte d'y retourner!"}
{"text":"Meals served hot and well prepared.  Nice restaurant ambiance.  Be sure to ask about  how spicy dishes are.  Waiter attentive.  Moderately priced."}
{"text":"I didn't know what to expect since this place seemed a little touristy from the outside, but I am thoroughly impressed.  Reuben's is definitely a place to visit in Montreal.  I had the Super Sandwich, a 10 oz. smoked beef sandwich with swiss cheese and mustard on rye.  You can get various iterations of the sandwich (on a bun instead of rye, with lettuce & tomato, etc.) and I imagine you can't go wrong with any of them.  The meat is so tender and juicy, your teeth cut through it like a hot knife through butter.  Sometimes when I get a corned beef sandwich somewhere else, it's just tough enough that one bite will draw out a huge slice of beef from the sandwich, creating a sloppy mess -- not the case at Reuben's.  And the fries are awesome -- my son says they're just like McDonald's but not as greasy (this is a high compliment in case you were wondering).  We also had a caesar salad which was also very good - crisp romaine, plenty of parmesan cheese, and a filleted grilled chicken on top with two large hunks of garlic bread with three cheeses melted on top.  It's a casual restaurant, but the inside appears very upscale, with wood-paneling on the walls, racks of wine everywhere, and a nice display of beef cuts.  Not exactly the type of interior that you'd expect for a beef sandwich and fries, but the food matches the interior - high class."}
{"text":"This was the only spot I had the opportunity to try Poutine at and, can I say, this is a new favorite of mine that's for sure.  This place is also gracious enough to be open VERY late for an out of towner who had to wait in Immigration...   So, the Poutine was stacked with:  Smoked Meat Cheese Curds Gravy  The fries were pretty damn good too.  I added a Molson on draft, which completed the experience."}
{"text":"Good menu selection, feels casual, but price for steaks are a little on high side.  Great appetizer selection that is reasonably priced.  Appetizers and sandwiches give this place the \"Deli\" feel, along with fun, fast paced noise level.  Playing rock music while eating which is interesting.  Feels like a really, really high end deli (highest I've been in), has the same faced paced atmosphere as delis (along with potato pancakes) but with classic rock music in background.  Noise level is about that of a deli."}
{"text":"Knocked off 2 of the Montreal \"musts\" while at Reuben's. The chop chop poutine is a must have. Chopped up smoked meat brisket with your cheese curds and gravy smothered over the fries. So good. And then the smoked meat sandwiches.... wow. Okay, you can't go wrong. We had the turkey and the reuben and were not disappointed. Had some for leftovers too. Highly recommend this stop if you're in Montreal and it's perfectly located on saint catherine street if you wish to continue shopping... or in our case bar crawling."}
{"text":"Smoked meat sandwich reminiscent of NYC delis.  Also had the poutine with smoked meat on top.  Plenty of gravy and smoked meat; just wish the fries were thicker / more substantial.  All-in-all, was ok; not amazing, but ok.  Switched out the fries for the side salad; which was definitely nothing to write home about.  Is pretty bland, heavy American / European fare, but not bad."}
{"text":"Yelp told me that there were two places to get the best smoked meat in Montreal:  Reuben's and Schwartz's.  My friends and I happened to pass by Schwartz's on our way back to the hotel and the line was down the street - we just knew it wasn't going to happen, so we decided to check out Reuben's.  Thankfully, this story has a happy and delicious ending because Reuben's was freaking fantastic!  My boyfriend and I decided to split the smoked meat poutine and the Famous Super Sandwich (smoked meat EVERYWHERE!!!!).  I honestly couldn't have asked for more.  The poutine was the best I'd had while in Montreal (and believe me, I tried it at several places...for science!) - the gravy was flavorful and hot, the cheese curds were like little mountains, and the smoked meat was piled high.  It was heaven!  The smoked meat sammie was also delicious.  The smoked meat was plentiful, the rye bread made for some tasty bookends, and the mustard was perfection.  Excellent meal right here...just so good.  Service was great, food was awesome, the restaurant was clean as can be.  If you're in the area, definitely check Reuben's out!"}
{"text":"We loved this so much better than Schwartz's and the location is much easier to get to from downtown. The restaurant itself is nice and spacious. There's a decent sized waiting area so that you're not stuck outside. We loved the booth we sat at, had a really old school feel to it. The service was great, and we loved the sandwich! The smoked meat was so moist and tender and the portion was huge. It's probably the only sandwiche I would happily compare to Langers pastrami in LA. I was sad we didn't go back for round two, we'll definitely be back the next time we're in town!"}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite deli in the city. To me they have the best smoked meat and if you' really want a unique burger go for the BOSS burger. The location is as good as it gets in the middle of the best part of St-Catherine St. downtown. You walk in and automatically feel hungry....there's a big glass case packed with smoked meat on one side and a display case packed with huge delicious cakes on the other side. Come hungry, the portions are large and the food is so good you'll want to eat it all. It's a gourmet deli, great decor and a more upscale feel. If you live here or are visiting you need to add Reuben's to your list of places to try."}
{"text":"I ate at Ruebens recently with a group a co-workers and was pleasantly surprised by the quality and presentation of the food and the dedication of the waitstaff. A vegetarian, I'm always happy if a restaurant offers items I can eat. I selected a Greek salad with a generous serving of fresh vegetables and a cocktail, which I'll order again in a heartbeat if I find myself in downtown Montreal. This place is worth a try, even if steaks and sandwiches aren't your \"thing.\""}
{"text":"Style over substance. Ruben was an unmanageable mess, poutine had more fries than curds or gravy, no good beer on the menu.   Vegetarian options are pasta, pizza, or you can ask for a salad with no meat."}
{"text":"Good food, Montreal at it's best!! The portions are generous and fresh. Must go place if you are in Montreal"}
{"text":"Pretty good place, big portions, servers nice, friendly, and professional .... It's my first time here and might come back again .... food was delicious and portions are pretty big..."}
{"text":"After going to Schwartz's this was a huge disappointment. The smoked meat tasted more like bologna/salami and the poutine was very underwhelming.   We ordered the two signature sandwiches, which were very overpriced, and we were visiting from NYC, so that's saying a lot.  The service was mediocre, they forgot to bring one of the appetizers and my boyfriend had to eat it while his food got cold. They charge for refills on soda and don't even fill the glass to the top.  The only redeeming part of the meal was the beef wontons, those happened to be delicious!  Definitely felt like a tourist trap, wouldn't recommend."}
{"text":"Good food. Great menu options. Nice sit down restaurant style seating. Food is prepared quickly. Everybody reviews that the smoked meat is great, which it it. And its in a great location with much shopping and other restaurants around."}
{"text":"I love this place ! Super chill ! Foods are always the way I want it ! Nice staff! They always make my steak the way I want it never over cooked it !! Big portion and really Nothing to complain about ! Worth to try it !!!"}
{"text":"Very expensive but great diner food. The hostesses have the mostessness. Liquor is served and their specialty is you guessed it ! Cole slaw! No just kidding. The slaw is not like American cole slaw, there's no mayo! It's made with vineagar. Yuck but it tasted very fresh, so fresh I could get past that tangy taste. The french fries are better then McDonalds, yummy.   Portions are HUGE, plan on taking it home or share it with others to bed down the costs."}
{"text":"There are perhaps five places on this entire planet that have been able to deliver me a food experience where I can say \"if it were any better, it wouldn't matter.\" Reuben's is one of them.  As you likely know, viande fume, or smoked meat, is one of a handful of famous Montreal foods.  It's basically a super thick, super rich, warm serving of pastrami.  What I didn't know, and almost couldn't believe, is how large a difference there is between the \"smoked meat\" you get from the world-famous Schwartz's and the \"smoked meat\" you can get at the also-famous Reuben's.  Reuben's is super duper moist and tender and pinkish in color, while Schwartz's is redder, drier and more crumbly.  While Schwartz's is flavorful and excellent, it didn't cause me to roll my eyes and moan the way Reuben's did.   Reuben's extra moisture and melt-in-your-mouth texture combines with a particularly rich and fatty cut of meat to fill your mouth with joy in a way that a drier sandwich simply cannot.  In other words, I think both are great, that Reuben's is better, and that it's not close.    Having said that, there is quite a lot of (internet and real life) debate about who provides the superior sandwich, and if you're a foodie I know you're going to go to Schwartz's anyway.  Heck, in my crew there were even a couple certified foodies who said they preferred Schwartz's, one of whom said the rich, moist texture of Reuben's was a bit \"too\" close to hot dog. Another was offended that Reuben's had more expensive offerings than Schwartz's.    In any case, get your Reuben's on and join the debate!  They give you quite a few options when ordering smoked meat here; get the \"famous\" one (which is just smoked meat on rye with mustard) and ask for it \"medium fatty\" which is one level above the default but not the crazy top level which is just \"fatty.\"  BEST X AARON'S EVER HAD AWARD WINNER: PASTRAMI (for the pastrami in their medium fatty smoked meat sandwich)"}
{"text":"I must say that I was very impressed. I am not a smoked meat person at all but went here to please a friend. To start, the ambiance was not at all what I was expecting ( in a good way ). I ordered the"}
{"text":"Viande fumée excellente et que dire des portions gargantuesques de dessert! Un peu cher côté qualité prix mais très intéressant"}
{"text":"I've been coming here since it re opened at least once a month. My favourite dish to order is the Delmonico steak sandwich with a spinach dip to start. The steak sandwich has an amazing garlic aioli sauce with portobello mushrooms and crunchy onions. The spinach dip is the best in the city and it humiliates the spinach dip from Baton Rouge. Service is a little slow but friendly, ambience is inviting and classy yet casual. All in all it's a regular place for me to eat at."}
{"text":"I've been to Reuben's many times and the food has always been good. Huge portions at a very reasonable price is probably what they do best. The three stars are based on the food, not portion size or anything else. I was here this past weekend and ordered a Greek salad that was seriously enough for four people.   One disappointment was a breakfast skillet that may have been prepared in bulk ahead of my order."}
{"text":"The food here is pretty good. Both their Reubens Skillet and Bagel and lox are quite good and highly recommended. However, they were a bit stingy on the Reubens skillet that I got for breakfast, was kind of expecting there to be more meat if it's the focal point of the meal. The potatoes, sautéed onions, sauerkraut and cheese were otherwise a perfect combination. My only recommendation is for them to put just a bit more meat, I felt like I ran out of meat before I finished the skillet, which I did and as a result I didn't finish the skillet. I left about half of the potatoes because that's a all that was left.  The wait staff were also very helpful attentive and professional even though I did hear the manager yelling at someone in the kitchen about strawberries when I was eating, haha."}
{"text":"Wow delicious and huge! Clearly the correct place to go to after working out for two hours at the gym, to undo everything I've done for a week!  I got their smoked meat AND poutine and both were delicious. I don't really even need to explain the food at all just go, get the poutine with it and be Canadian!"}
{"text":"???????,????????????????????????????????? ????Mac cheese ,?????????????????????????????? ??????????????????????????????Tequlia lime jumbo shrimp salad , ?????? ???????????????????????poutine ?????????????????????????????????? ?????????locals ??????????????shopping ?????????????????"}
{"text":"The food was good but overpriced. Ambiance was loud and very hectic. More of a family restaurant than a date night place. Wine list was okay but waitress mentioned that it was being changed soon."}
{"text":"Reuben's food was just okay, and certainly not deserving of the hype. The smoked meat in my sandwich was too soft for my taste, almost like it had been boiled an excessive amount of time. Good thing I had a poutine side to fill me up. Wifey got a ribeye steak that was drowned in salt and pepper in a failed attempt to disguise the mediocre quality. Worst of all, the prices were high for the quality served. Do what I should have done - pass."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in to have a dessert and tea in February. Wow this place had an amazing menu to chose from and the service was beyond helpful and friendly. Watching everything that came out looked as though it was meant for a photograph. AMAZING, we will most definitely come back here!"}
{"text":"Okay so Reubens is not the venerable Schwartz's or the tried and true Dunn's but they do serve a mean smoked meat sandwich. I usually order the Builder's platter which comes with a mound of machine sliced smoked meat{ Fatty of course} 4 slices of fresh and sturdy rye,fries ,slaw and half a pickle but this time I opted for a pound of fatty,well seasoned with some crisry ends meat.  My wife usually opts for the Reuben spaghetti with extra cheese and while still a hearty and tasty entree we've found that they have cut back on the actual smoked meat ends that made this dish so decadent and substituted minced meat to make up the Bolognase sauce...disappointing but there is still enough smoked meat to make it a worth while entree. Reubens's menu covers all that you would expect in this slick and popular fast ,casual concept and the food has never been anything less than good and at a good price.....but for the true Montreal Smoked meat experience you have to at least try the always packed Schwartz's before the new owners morph it into ..........Reuben's."}
{"text":"Oh My! Stopped into Reuben's hoping to find Matzo Ball Soup. While there was not a Matzo Ball to be found, I was pleasantly impressed with a humongous mountain sized serving of Chop Chop Poutine. Now this Poutine was not your basic variety- this is Poutine made by God's.  The stuff is nothing short of fabulous. It begins with a pile of delicious fresh French Fries, drowned in yummy brown gravy and a generous amount of cheese curds - and it doesn't stop there. My friends at Reuben's then add a generous mound of the most flavorful smoked beef brisket I have had in quite some time. The Chop Chop Poutine at Reuben's is pure genius,  a masterpiece which tickled my taste buds and is now doing the happy dance in my satisfied- but very full belly."}
{"text":"Ordered the Reuben and original '76. It was delicious. The Reuben has thinly sliced meat and original '76 is soften thicker meat. I liked the thicker one. So soft. Portion is good. Large . Montreal smoked meat!! So yummy"}
{"text":"Huge place waited about 15 min for a seat. Got a bit too much food. Three people split two sandwiches, a poutine and a strawberry cheescake. Cheesecake was a weird lowkey texture but it tasted good. Smoked meet was mindblowing. Ive never had it before so i had no idea what to expect. Its delicious and so juicy. Poutine was heavy and delicious. Great experience"}
{"text":"The food is overpriced and does not taste very good.  Also, the wait staff is stuck up and rude.  My friend ordered the pork chop, and I ordered the steak sandwich.  Neither were good.  The pork chop meat was tough and served with too much of a disgusting, thick brown gravy-type sauce that overtook the taste of the pork.  My steak was greasy and too firm.  When I requested that my sandwich be brought out without bread, the waitress looked confused and asked \"no bread at all?\"  I guess she was not familiar with the Atkins diet.  I repeated \"no bread,\" at which point she looked at my friend (as if to imply I was crazy), then rolled her eyes and said \"as you wish.\"  I could have done without the drama.  Just bring out the damn sandwich without bread if a customer requests it!  Gees!  And, the meal came to close to $70 just for what I mentioned above!  Ridiculous!  I won't eat here again!"}
{"text":"Last week we were there. Sandwiches were delicious but French fries was one of the best I've had around lol. And waitress was a very nice lady. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Gave a 4 because we got charged for ordering extra gravy and pickles. As koreans, the food was way too  (greasy?) for us so we ordered more pickles and they the mashed potatoes were a bit bland so we ordered more gravy, but they ended up on our bill.. Also, coming from the US with unlimited fountain drinks, not having that option made this meal that much more  (greasy?) the reuben wasn't my cup of tea, but the poutine was BOMB"}
{"text":"I've heard about smoked meat as a popular Montreal food and just so happen to walk past this location around dinner time.  I ordered the Famous Super Sandwich and a side of poutine. You can choose the amount of fat you want on the meat in your sandwich and I chose medium. Being my first night in Montreal, the poutine hit the spot and was really good. The size of the sandwich shocked me at first, but I was ready to tackle it. The meat was so soft and not tough at all. It was smoked really well. It was nice that they gave me a bottle of mustard on the side because it definitely needed a bit more mustard. The bread also wasn't anything too impressive to me; just al-rye-t (lol).  It was a Sunday night and I was able to get a table spot (I was by myself) even though they initially just offered me a spot at the bar. The servers were really nice, helpful, and attentive to me. However, I did spot a couple tables that had some people waiting a bit more than me (and even longer than usual) just for their order to get taken.   Overall, would recommend Reuben's especially if you're visiting Montreal and want to try smoked meat!"}
{"text":"Mom wanted to come here to try the smoked meat; so we did! The food was delicious but my two complaints are: 1. I was in the booth right next to the hostess stand and everytime they got a pile of menus they would stack them and blow air/dust into my face. At first I ignored it, but it happened every 5-10 minutes while sitting there. Either the hostess didn't realize they do this, or they just don't care. 2. Hamburgers in Canada cannot be served less than medium-well. I figured that I sometimes eat my burger Medium-well, but this burger was well WELL done.  Mom seemed to enjoy her smoked meat and there was a variety beers to select from."}
{"text":"Yum!! \"Smoked meat\" as they call it here in Canada as super tasty! I had the lunch special along with a slice of their carrot cake. Everything was tasty. I ordered a mojito which tasted like juice, other than that, I enjoyed my meal!"}
{"text":"Can't visit montreal and not get yourself some smoked meat! I went with the classic. So. much. meat. Perfect for your gains and wonderful ratio of meat-to-bread for your low carb diet... Extremely tasty. The fries are a good compliment-- thinly sliced and crispy. I tried a bite of my aunt's liver sandwich; not something you can get just anywhere. I enjoyed it but no where nearly as much as my order."}
{"text":"Nothing special. Once you've had schwartz smoked meat isn't the same anywhere else. The poutine was disappointing. Movie theatre poutine tastes much better."}
{"text":"Loved this place.  The service staff was fun and efficient.  The food was beyond our expectations.  six of us highly recommend it."}
{"text":"The best corned beef Reuben in town and probably one of the best in North America. Other American and Canadian specialties complete a vast menu (ever tried poutine?). Don't miss it if you happen to be in downtown Montreal! Around 20 Usd."}
{"text":"Stopped here for breakfast on our way to the Barbie expo.  It's in a great location right in the heart of Downtown Montreal. The food was delicious! We ordered pancakes, grilled cheese sandwich and skillet potatoes. The prices were really great. For two people our order was less than $20.  I would definitely come back again!!"}
{"text":"Both locals and friends who have visited Montreal all reccomended we try their smoked meat while in town. Now where to go? The concierge at our hotel suggested Reuben's. This specific location offers a large restaurant dining, where the other is more like a deli with booths. Worth walking the extra 1/4 mile. The service was so fast! Our drinks, taking our food order and food being served in under 30 minutes. Our server was so nice and patient, answering many questions about the Poutine, famous brisket and more. The food was outstanding. I swear it was the best sandwich I have ever had.  Perfectly toasted bread with melt in your mouth BBQ. My husband felt the same about his Famous sandwich."}
{"text":"The price brought it down a star. When my buddy asked for a side of BBQ sauce it was $2!!! That is kinda crazy. Everyone loved the food and portions are gigantic so your kinda paying for 2 meals if you take some home. The waiter was friendly and food came out promptly. I do not have much to say about Reubens other than you will be full when you leave and it might be a little more than you expected but in general A-OK."}
{"text":"One of my favorite if not my very favorite eatery in Montreal will get some props. Montreal is well known for its delis and its very own classic, the smoked-meat sandwich which is often copied and never ever duplicated. It is singular in taste and confection. Such institutions such as Ben's have disappeared for trifle reasons as union disputes but thankfully the ubiquitous master, Schwartz still stands and is worth the long wait lines but remains a little out of the way for the downtown dwellers.   I don't hang on St-Laurent, too pretentious and packed with puerile brats driving daddy's expensive car. I hang downtown on Ste-Catherine where the fun is and when I don't want to waste time deciding where to eat I go to Reuben's.  And let's clarify that I don't mean the one on 888 Ste-Catherine but the one on 1116, the one with the art-deco inspired look.  I go there A LOT. Because their food just rocks. It's deli food but a little bit more upscale. There was a time when Reuben's was just a regular Deli with awesome deli food then something happened and it went upscale but kept the taste. They used to have old school filet mignon, you know the one wrapped with bacon and with stir fried canned mushrooms dumped on it. It wasn't very pricy but it was on OK piece of steak. Now they have Filet Mignon at 30$ for 8oz but it is the best steak I've had in Montreal (and the rest of their steak selections are also equally amazing) always served standalone with roasted mushrooms and perfectly spiced, seared and cooked to your liking. An explosion of flavor in each bite. Because of Reuben's I no longer purchase steak for home, there isn't any point because there's no way it can be made this good. It can be served with fries, but I strongly suggest the Yukon Gold mash with garlic, it's got a KICK to it that is unmistakable.   I've also tried the very simple deli classic, the baguette au jus simply because I wasn't in the mood for a huge filler of a steak and even something so simple was made to taste better by lightly searing the bread on the flat grill along with the steak and the jus was insane. So simple and easy and the BAM! Foodgasm.  And yesterday, still not in the mood for steak, because as much as I love and worship the steak, one can overdoes on it, I decided I wanted the ultimate Reuben's classic sandwich which I had had in many other places before, The Reuben's. It's a smoked-meat sandwich with sauerkraut, Swiss cheese and the \"special sauce\" (I hate that expression) slammed between pumpernickel bread and then grilled. I was only after the first half did I stop having spasms and stop moaning in delight. Such foody goodness shouldn't be permitted. Eating it was a messy affaire and required plenty of napkins but just like the perfect burger, if you don't make a mess, it's not the perfect burger. Sadly the cole-slaw fails.  There are plenty of deserts to chose from at Reuben's and all are portions for two but when at Reuben's there is only one desert that matters. And trust me on this, they have the absolute best carrot cake you will eat in your short life. It is the orgasmatron of deserts, soft, chewy, moist, and sugary and an explosion of flavory goodness. It can't be beat  The service is normally very good, though I wouldn't say so after last night. But I'll hold that on single bad time as an isolated event. And as I was eating desert, I saw a plate of sliders go buy... they have sliders? I never got to the burger part of the menu yet. Damn! Next time. In the mean time, my favorite Deli gets a proper 5 outta 5."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious. This place puts Schwartz's to shame. Forget the hype of the old school hole in the wall. This was a great meal and wonderful atmosphere to boot!"}
{"text":"We enjoyed the Reuben's super sandwich and the portions are huge indeed. The place is pretty pricey, but that definitely wasn't the issue - the issue was that our server opened the book with a bill right in front of us, counted the money in front of us (!) and asked if we needed change. I said no. Made us feel like, well, never coming back (I guess it was clear to him that we are tourists), and ruined the impression of the restaurant after a pretty good meal."}
{"text":"I've eaten at a lot of delis, and this was in the top 10. It's a lovely place, it feels like a New York or Russian Hill deli, but the food is just a slight step below what you'll find at those places.   I had the Smoked Meat Poutine. The Meat was amazing. I've never had better. The fries were pretty good, but the gravy and cheese were all amazing. The while thing was in a pile. I can't believe I managed to finish the entire plate.   I'd love to go back, but who knows the next time I'll be in Montreal."}
{"text":"Montreal seems to be blessed with lots of sit down breakfast joints in its downtown area, Reuben's being one of them. Why does it stand out? For many reasons, the first being that the interior of the restaurant is upper scale and cozy. The minute you walk-in, you'll probably assume that the average bill is around 20$ with Reuben's looking how it does and being where it is, but it's not. Come before 9pm for the early bird special and the price is around 5.99$, coffee included! I usually order the classic 2 eggs with a side of sausage, ham or bacon, served with delicious, perfectly seasoned homefries, and toast. Be warned that the plates are large and portions generous, but not over the top. Now i've never been to Reuben's for lunch or dinner but they are usually packed, boasting a full bar, the place is known for their large slices of cake on display and their smoke meat sandwiches. Be prepared to pay however if you choose to go for lunch or dinner, as I've heard that it can set you back 20-30$. All in all, great place, amazing vibe, and best quality at a low price! How they do it, I have no idea, but I am a big fan"}
{"text":"Great food and awesome customer service! Their French onion soup is delicious. Went with very low expectations but the food exceeded my expectations exponentially. Definitely going back to try other dishes on the menu!"}
{"text":"Without a doubt, the BEST poutine place in Montreal. Their BBQ Short Rib Poutine is to die for. Delicious home-made gravy, perfect McDonald's-style fries, squeaky clean cheese curds, and the most flavourful BBQ short ribs. Absolutely incredible.   I initially came here to try their smoked meat to see if it rivals the legendary Schwartz (it does!) but came away raving about the poutine. I even came back here again a second time in one weekend trip to eat the poutine again. The burgers and other fare are fairly good as well but do yourself a favour and go for the poutine.   Also got the chance to meet Ron, the ?manager/owner and we struck up a great conversation. Super nice guy even offered me and my girlfriend cheesecake to take with us for free when we left."}
{"text":"Gord and I had lunch today at Reuben's, which has been around since 1976.  We both ordered the Famous Super Smoked Meat Sandwich (medium cut so it was a bit fatty and more tender).  I had mine with mashed potatoes and Gord had his with a Caesar's Salad.  It was all delicious!  The desserts looked amazing but alas, I was too full.  Sonia was our server.  She was friendly and took good care of us."}
{"text":"The Original Reuben Sandwich is worth the stop. The portion is huge and is served with a pickle and fries. It comes on pumpernickel bread and is hands down the best pastrami sandwich."}
{"text":"Dissapointing. I ordered the Montréal Smoked Meat Sliders, which I pointed to as I ordered. The food came and I was served the Kobe beef sliders. When I asked the server if it was the smoked meat sliders he said no and seemed confused. I told him I had asked for the other sliders. He then offered to \"bring me a plate with a pile of smoke meat\". I said no, I'd prefer the whole meal because they have different toppings and sides. Mistakes happen, but it was a bizarre offer.  My second issue was that the correct sliders came, but I was disappointed again because they were covered in mustard, which wasn't listed on the menu. I specifically ordered these because I don't like mustard and almost all the other sandwiches listed mustard.  The few bites of meat that I did end up eating was very good. Bummer :("}
{"text":"Great variety of food on the menu, which usually translates to a lack of quality on many items. Luckily this is not the case here. Every item is of great quality because of the freshness of the ingredients and the fact that almost everything is prepared in-house (many of the desserts are not, but are instead brought in from Dawn's Desserts (which sounds like bad thing, but it isn't. Dawn's makes amazing desserts))."}
{"text":"AHHHHH! I love Reuben's!! Came here for the first time since it was a staple to go to Reuben's on your first visit to Montreal and I was so glad I went!   I obviously ordered the Original Reuben Sandwich and it was heaven. Everything about the sandwich was amazing right down to the secret sauce that I loved so much! The coleslaw was also very good - not too creamy and nothing like a regular coleslaw. I also poutined my fries and I do not regret my decision. Although this place won't be good for you if you're on a diet but I do suggest you should come here for your cheat day and indulge!   I highly recommend this place! I enjoyed my meal so much I forced my bf to come here for the second time during our trip!"}
{"text":"Make sure you have enough patient. Manager definitely needs to hire more people."}
{"text":"First time here. got seated and ordered at 2:45pm.  After we complained a couple times, my fiancee and I still didn't get our food (steak sandwich and flatbread pizza with deli meat) until 3:30pm. pizza was soggy and fell apart easily. My sandwich was ok but the fries were hard. We were not pleased. not going back there even when their manager offered free dessert."}
{"text":"Du fromage à l'intérieur d'un sandwich smoke-meat ? Désolé, mais non ! Et pourtant, Reuben's le présente comme LE sandwich Deli de Montréal. Pour moi, ça ne passe pas le test. Loin s'en faut. Et pour bien des raisons. D'abord, Reuben's n'offre pas de choix entre une viande fumée maigre ou régulière. Ensuite, la viande est mince comme du papier. Les épices donnent un étrange gouts de sucre à l'ensemble. Puis enfin, le pain de seigle est imbibé de gras de cuisson (et c'est voulu!). Le tout servi avec une portion de frittes décongelée.   Les points positifs : un menu très varié avec un choix de steak et différentes assiettes de poulet. Un bon choix de vin. Un décor  chic et \"trendy\". Des banquettes propres et confortables. Le service est très bon et rapide.  Vous l'aurez compris, je suis plutôt partagé à propos de ce Reuben's situé sur St-Catherine. Si on oublie le sandwich Deli qui devrait être la spécialité maison, c'est bon resto dans l'ensemble."}
{"text":"Reuben's may be called a deli but it's nothing like a hole in the wall deli that you get your cold sandwich!  It reminds me of a club because of their booths, Art Deco fixtures and paneled walls.   We dropped in here for lunch and it was just fantastic!  Dh had the smoked meat sandwich and he said it was the best ever. The kids liked the pulled bbq pork sandwich and smoked meat Mac n cheese. I had a chicken Caesar salad and potato pancakes. The pancakes were the best I've ever had. It was super yummy but a bit greasy. We finished the meal by sharing a chocolate cake. That was the best cake ever!  The cake was super moist and yummy.  Service was brisk and efficient. We loved our server Marc Andre. He was very nice."}
{"text":"Reubens is a most go to spot if your in the area. Every time I visit Montréal I must eat here and food and service hasn't disappointed. My wife had the southwest salad which is amazing and huge portion and had the Texas toast grilled cheese steak sandwich. The sandwich is out of this world, cooked perfectly and super tender. Waitress was super accommodating also with my 2 kids. All around delicious place to eat with a huge menu"}
{"text":"This was our first smoke meats place that we went to when we first came to Montreal and is still one of our favorites. There are two locations on St. Cats, but we've only been to this one which is somewhere between fancy steakhouse and casual diner. The other one seems more like a take out joint but I'm just guessing.   The staff here is fantastic and very helpful, going above and beyond their duties.  The first time we were here we had a double stroller and I felt bad about taking up so much space but the staff was so nice and found a perfect spot for it without batting an eye. Made us feel very welcomed and was really sweet with the kids. Another time, one of our waiters was kind enough to recommend where locals buy household goods and appliances while we were staying in town.  Really appreciate people who love their job. It really shines through.   Ok let's talk about food!  The pastrami sandwich is a must. They have a special with their house beer which is fantastic. I can't remember whether it's just a lunch special or all day but the sandwich/beer combo is stellar. I believe the beer was crafted specifically for them so definitely ask about that beer."}
{"text":"Wow what an incredible place!! The food was dynamite. Had smoked meat wontons to start and then had the club roll...melt in your mouth!! My husband had the smoked meat traditional sandwich and it was love at first bite!! Our waiter Kevin made our dining experience incredible. I had accidentally spilled a drop of gravy on my HABS shirt perfectly placed on the white part of the symbol. Kevin noticed right away and said \"don't touch it, I'll be right back\" he quickly returned with club soda and napkins to clean it properly. He certainly didn't have to do that, just a wonderful way to end our dining experience!! We had NO room for dessert, didn't even make it through our dinner. The portions are HUGE. So we took dessert back to the hotel with us!!! Schwartz was too far to walk to and happened by Reuben's. Fabulous experience!!"}
{"text":"Im surprised I havent reviewed this place before. I've been to both the Reubens and have had great experiences. It is a deli, so meat eaters will LOVE IT. Great steak cuts, smoked meat and other deli sandwiches. Service is fast and theyve also got a full bar. They also have a great display of desserts. **cough cough** **cheese cake**  **cough cough**  Yeaahhh. Anyway Reubens is great for family, friends, co workers to come hangout over food and drinks in the heart of downtown where everyone can make it to. Cheers!"}
{"text":"French dip and a side of poutine. Looked great, service great, food not good. The beef in the French dip sandwich was dried out and overcooked.  The poutine was average, had better, had worse. But as soon as we got the check, I had very bad stomach cramps. Big diarrhea, had to use toilet, Kaboom!   I walked home 30 minute walk, last 10 minutes, I could feel another one coming on. Kaboom, again. I hope it's out of my system, not a good experience at this place."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Great fresh food cooked very well. Gourmet style. Nicky settled downtown near some hotels."}
{"text":"I came here craving for some poutine, but because La Banquise was pretty far away, I took my chance on this.  And you can tell the difference. Definitely not the same. Not the worst..but definitely not the best either.  I also ordered pie and ice cream, just so I can leave here happy. And I was.  I did have a good time sitting behind the counter talking with the random people there."}
{"text":"We arrived at 5:30 and this place was almost full.  We had a chop-chop poutine (with minced smoked meat), a smoked meat sandwich plate and a Jack Daniel BBQ beef rib pizza.   I never liked poutine but this one was sooo good. Totally changed my negative impression of poutine, so flavorful. Will come again to have it. For the smoked meat sandwich, we go to Schwartz's Deli regularly, and we both like Schwartz more. Beef rib pizza was very good. I like the sauce and big chunks of beef. Just wonderful. I noticed they have so many choices of cake as dessert. You can have a slice or the whole cake. they'd love to pack it for you if you have no room left. I think the price for dessert is a bit high.  The service was excellent.  Overall recommended."}
{"text":"Ordered the Big Bang Sandwich.  There was a lot of meat on there (1lb).  It is stacked in a way to make it look much bigger than it is, which only made it difficult to eat.    The beef was tender and juicy, but lacked punch.  There was a dab of mustard on there, but it need a dollop with all that beef.  The chop-chop poutine appetizer was ok - covered in their famoust beef and with cheese curds (wasn't a fan of the curds).  A lot of really good french fries came with the dish though.  Overall it was a ho hum experience.  I think the recent string of really good delis had me expecting much more than Reubens had to offer.  The waiter was nonexistent though.  Didn't offer a refill of my beer, didn't give us plates until after the app came out...the little things."}
{"text":"I have to say, this restaurant was amazing! This is the first time I travel to Montreal and everyone is very kind. Especially at this restaurant. My boyfriend decided to bring me here for my birthday to have dinner. The food was spectacular. The environment of the restaurant is casual/dressy. Our waitress was wonderful. Her name is Lauriève. \"Lauri\", since I couldn't pronounce it. She is kind, and has great customer service! Thank you for such a great night!"}
{"text":"Great place to eat! The service is A+ and food was top notch. They are busy but they move quickly which we really appreciated. The portions are HUGE which is something we were not prepared for. The smoke meat sandwich was delightful and the sides were very montrealish which I appreciated.  Everyone has top notch things to say about the deserts which I found to be good but nothing extraordinary.  Great place to go- I would recommend visiting."}
{"text":"The smoked meat here is amazing! Recommend 100%. The service was functional and prompt. I just wish I'd had room for a slice of cheesecake!"}
{"text":"Je connais beaucoup de gens qui ont testé le Reuben's pour le lunch et le souper et j'en ai entendu beaucoup de bien. Il y a un grand choix de plats pour pas cher et ils ont bien plus que de la poutine, des sandwichs ou burger. En effet, ils proposent des smoke meat qui sont très populaires, de la viande (même de type filet mignon), du poulet, du poisson et des salades. On m'a dit que leur cheesecake était à tomber par terre, ils en ont aux fraises ou bleuets. Personnellement, je suis allée tester leur brunch qui a lieu le samedi et dimanche jusqu'à 11h30am. Cela en vaut vraiment la peine. Déjà les prix sont tellement bas que je doutais de la qualité. J'ai pris le deux par quatre à 9.99 qui comprend deux ufs et 4 crepes américaines. OMG, mais c'était trop bon!!! Les crepes parfaites, goûteuses et bien épaisses. J'ai adoré. Et le pain de seigle qui venait avec les ufs étaient vraiment un bon choix. Mon copain quant à lui a pris une omelette, je ne sais plus laquelle, mais il y avait de la viande fumée et du fromage et il a beaucoup aimé.  A tester surtout si vous êtes en famille."}
{"text":"Great smoked meat, environment is not bad and serving was so so"}
{"text":"I'm going to start by saying your food was amazing.... THE REASON you lost one star for the wait, both for food and for my husbands coffee which took over 30minutes to bring.  He was being grouchy because he was hung over and really needed the coffee, so maybe the wait seemed a lot longer, I probably would've given you 4.5* if Yelp had that option.   The meat was fantastic!  I tried the french dip which my husband said was the best he's ever had, I wouldn't know I barely got a bite before he took it back.... and the smoked meat and the chop chop poutine.  I would skip the poutine here as the gravy was very light in flavour and fries were shoestring which I don''t think works well with Poutine.   The sandwiches though, worth the drive to Montreal!!"}
{"text":"Off to a good start place is picture perfect service is so far alright but out of the first two wines by the glass for my wife, I ordered a Chivas on the rocks.  A 1 once pour I have never seen a one ounce pour it literally lined the bottom of my glass. Wine served warm it's little things that mean a lot perhaps a bump price for a second ounce and for $12 for a glass of house wine served temp was approx 78   have some respect for the craft it's Montreal. Server was kind and food was well priced, tasted well and good quality it seems we have a problem with the bar"}
{"text":"The food was good. The waiter was in a hurry for some reason. We got the Alfredo pasta, teriyaki salad and Greek salad. Everything was ok. The only good thing about this place is that at 11:30pm this was the only place to go with kids."}
{"text":"Great deli!  Love this place.  I always get the same thing. A freaking big pile of delicious smoked meat!  I go medium fat. Why not? That's where the flavour is. They get you in and out fast but I have never felt rushed. Just fast service."}
{"text":"Good quality of food in vast quantities Think twice before ordering even if you're hungry"}
{"text":"A lot more expensive than Schwartz but at least you get a dining experience and there are no line ups. I myself am not a smoked meat fan but my friends are. They love the poutine there $10 and the meat itself is apparently really good.   I ended up with a classic club. Which by all standards was as good as any chicken club. However, the portion of the chicken was half that of the bread so it would have been nice to have a bigger piece. $15 But then again, I am at a restaurant that caters more to smoked meat than anything else.   Staff is great! Good job. I have nothing against the place, just not my usually cup of tea."}
{"text":"FIRST OF ALL, if you're posting a review here make sure you at the RIGHT address! There are two Reubens within 2 blocks of each other on the same street. Did you go down a flight of stairs when going in? Then you're at the WRONG Reubens. A lot of reviewers have been poorly observant in this regard.  DECOR :  When you walk in you're greeted by a countless number of slabs of smoke meat that seem to screaming at you to eat them right then and there. You're always welcomed by a charming hostess that will inquire how many you are during your visit. While you wait, the odds are the place is full of people, whether it is for lunch or supper, this place is more popular than a Bon Jovi concert. There's a long nicely made bar counter that stretches across the joint where single seats can be used by single visitors. The bunks are large and comfortable while the space to walk is slightly restrictive by the amount of traffic. The atmosphere is warm and comfortable despite the chaos of it all.  FOOD :   This is MY smoke meat join of choice. I've been given a lot of flak by friends over the years for preferring Reubens over Schwartz but I stand firm in my position that Reubens is simply better than Schwartz. It's hard not to compare the two, particularly when talking about the best smoked meat in Montreal, yet they are SO different that I can't help love Reubens so much more.  Firstly, Reubens can accommodate more people, I'm not a fan of Schwartz in this regard. It's become too touristy and the line-ups during specific moments in the day can be pretty ridiculous. No one wants to wait 30 minutes, outside during winter to sit down to eat a smoked meat sandwich.  Secondly, my sandwiches at Reubens have always been perfect. I've never gotten a mediocre cut that was fatty or dry. I've gotten a few mediocre sandwiches over the years when at Schwartz. Never at Reubens. Reubens sandwiches are moist and plump, while Schwartz can sometimes be very dry.  While Reubens offers a multitude of choices to eat, they definitely specialize in smoked meat. My personal favorite is the Euro, a ridiculously huge portion of smoked meat (offered also in lean cuts) between kaiser buns and Swiss cheese. Yet you can select with other variety of smoke meat sandwiches available. They also have other things on the menu that I've never really tried beyond their desert. Their caramel cheesecake is fantastic. (Check pictures).  Also, their Onion rings are out of this world. Try it with their Jack BBQ sauce!  PRICE :  Quality is rarely cheap in Montreal. Their Super Sandwich is about 15$. However, the potions are huge. If you're willing to pay a bit more, you'll get what you deserve and I recommend this sacrifice for some heavenly smoked meat. You won't be leaving this joint craving more food.  SERVICE :   I've heard some stories about mediocre service but I've never been disappointed. Service is LIGHTNING quick and efficient. Refills can sometimes take awhile but let's be honest, people need to get their FOOD ASAP! This place smells awesome, people come in hungry, they are immediately suffering with a lack of smoke meat in their mouth. The service must feed the hungry... not quench the thirst of the thirsty,  Joking aside, the service is pretty solid,  If you're new to Montreal or new to Reubens, check this place out, you won't be disappointed. It's been a personal favorite of mine for well over a decade!  However, kindly note, this DOES NOT apply if you go to the other Reubens. It's a completely different and mediocre experience. If you're going down stairs, STOP, you're not at the right Reubens. There should be a huge Second Cup sign beside this resto about 2 blocks away. Head there instead.  PROTIP : They will not allow you to sit down unless everyone is there, so if you have tardy folks, inform everyone so you're not standing there dumbly for 10-15 minutes while you wait with a bunch of other people."}
{"text":"Yes yes yes this is all 5 stars ! Can't even explain the sensation of such perfection in a delicious meal ! The I heart sandwich and the original Are a must !"}
{"text":"Really good atmosphere. The poutine and BLTA were amazing! The server was extremely nice!"}
{"text":"French dip sandwich was amazing. Awesome fries and their ceasar dressing is the best I have ever had! I wish they sold it!"}
{"text":"The smoked meat poutine was delicious. I didn't want to walk all the way to Schwartz's on our first day in montreal so we checked this place out.      The waiter was a little snobby but I'll leave that out of the rating.   The smoked meat was better than Schwartz's after having compared both. It was a much more consistent taste and it wasnt dry at all.   If you dont want to wait on a sidewalk for a crappy sandwich then go here instead of going to Schwartzs.   This is more of a big resteraunt with places to sit down and spend time with someone."}
{"text":"I love Reuben's. Whenever I am in Montreal, I stop by and have a bite to eat.   There are two Reuben locations on the same street. I completely bypassed the closest of the two and went to this one, which is the one that I frequent most often.   I held the door open for an older gentleman, who appreciated the gesture. He was a regular, as he was promptly seated. I was seated quickly, too. I just visit every year or less.   I ordered the beef dip on a French baguette. So flavourful and delicious. Good bread + au jus + tender beef = perfection!  Naturally, I ordered a Diet Coke to wash everything down. For someone who doesn't love fries, these were good. A woman at the booth next to mine complained that she didn't want a mountain of fries. I agree with her, but she downright said it in a harsh, loud manner. She then stomped out of the eatery.   Of course, I was stuffed, but still managed to order the bread pudding with ice cream. It was decadent and yummy. One of the servers actually turned her head at what she saw before me and asked whether I liked it. She has yet to try it. If you want to be in dessert coma heaven, this dessert is calling out your name.   The washrooms are on the second floor. It's definitely an older building. I stood up from my stall and could see everything in front of me, including the door leading me out!  (198)"}
{"text":"This place is always one of my lunch stops in Montreal....great smoked meat and fries!!!! Great location... They also have an amazing selection and delicious deserts, best chocolate cheese cake I have ever had!"}
{"text":"Decided to have breakfast at Reubens on the first day of my Montreal visit.  I was so impressed with the food and more importantly the service, that I came back on the last day of my visit again to have breakfast.  I have eaten at Reubens many times over the years at lunch and dinner time, but not at breakfast.  That has changed.  The serving was enormous and very tasty.  Had the breakfast sampler on the last day of my stay, 2 strips of bacon, 2 eggs, 2 thin slices of ham, 2 pancakes, toast and coffee for $9.99. I was extremely happy with the breakfast and didnt feel overly guilty eating so much in the morning as it was not too heavy.  My waitress for both days was excellent.   With a friendly demeanor, she showed herself to be comfortable speaking both french and english, which is nice for someone like me who does not always have the ability to speak french fluently.  Reubens will now be my regular breakfast stop while in Montreal. Was in Montreal early in June '16 and found out the owner, Gus, passed away in May, at the age of 82. His wit and personality will be sorrily missed. If you didnt meet him, you have definitely missed out one spectacular human... RIP Gus."}
{"text":"Couldn't decide between the smoked meat poutine and the smoked meat sandwich. Por que no los dos? I'll tell you why not both. The portion was huge. I almost died eating it all, but it would have been a good death. Smoked meat was so tender I could have eaten it without teeth."}
{"text":"There really is something for everyone on the menu at Reuben's. Now, yes, this place is kinda touristy in that it's in the heart of downtown where all the tourists are. However, I didn't feel like it's a tourist trap. Like it didn't feel like those places where the food is subpar but you \"go for the experience\". It felt like this place is probably well know for being a little touristy but you get somewhat of a local experience.  Food- Make sure you try the smoked meat. They really have some of the best smoked meat I tasted while in Toronto. It was so moist and fatty that it melted in my mouth. If our luggage wasn't already packed I probably would have grabbed a few pounds to take home.   Service- From the moment we walked in we were helped in some way. Our server went on break during our breakfast, but we were definitely not neglected. The replacement server was attentive and even chatted with us for a few minutes. He gave us some local insight on attractions to check out and which ones to skip. Unfortunately, we were grabbing breakfast on our way to the airport so we weren't able to check anything out. But, he definitely gave us a reason to come back to Montreal to check out the Jazz Festival and the Grand Prix.  Final note, yes, it feels touristy, but you should do it."}
{"text":"certainly biased...looking for the whole smoked meat experience and arrived by accidental situation upon Reubens..now that I have a M.O.T. experienced, the smoked meat....this place does deliver. Though completely touristy, can be overlooked by the attentive staff...and upon ordering option of lean...or fatty fatty as I ordered. Good...go."}
{"text":"If you're downtown and starving then come to Reuben's.  There are two locations downtown.  The other one is in a basement by McGill College and feels a little more run down than this location.  This is the one I always come to when I want Reuben's.  Their portions are enormous and you will not be hungry when you're done here.  The quality of the food is also pretty good and I always enjoy myself here.  I usually go for the smoked meat or burgers here.  The hamburger is always massive and adequately juicy.  The smoked meat is also another reliable choice.  It is not my favourite Montreal smoked meat but it is good enough and they give you a lot of meat.  Admittedly their fries aren't the greatest you will ever have.  I tend to prefer French fries that have a thicker cut and are double fried.  The fries here are too thin and kind of soggy almost.  Despite the fact I've been here many times I have never tried the desserts because I'm usually too full at this point.  In looking at the dessert case though it seems you can expect huge portions.  They have your typical variety of cakes (strawberry cheesecake, red velvet cake, etc).  Given its prime location Reuben's is very popular and generally quite busy.  You sometimes might have to wait for a table but if you're a small group it generally isn't too long.  Once you're seated service is generally very speedy.  The last time I went it was too slow for my liking but this was the first time (after many visits) that I have ever had a problem so it must have been an off night.  It is slightly on the pricy side considering that they are more of a casual kind of place but that's downtown for you.  That being said it is probably one of the better options when you're downtown.  If you're in the area then you should definitely consider coming here to satusfy your hunger."}
{"text":"Great breakfast here - and on a Sunday morning when everything else in the area was closed. Attentive server in general. Both of us ordered the the R.D. Skillet, with potatoes, onions, smoked meat, sauerkraut, and eggs. It was delicious. And it is served with your choice of bread - the light rye is also good. Good coffee, nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"Been here often and never been disappointed. Service is professional. The quality of their food is very good. Ambience is nice. Smoked meat is awesome."}
{"text":"I have been on vacation for a week in Montreal trying new places every night. I cannot express how amazing this restaurant is. The ambience was really good. I ordered some grilled chicken and it came with some delicious spices, let alone the french fries were to die for! Additionally, my colleague ordered salmon and she said it was delicious! My other colleague got smoked beef (pastrami) and said \"it's the best one i've ever had!\" Anyway, this place is great! Definitely going back!!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent diner food.  Courses were very large and the quality was great.  We visited two times while vacationing in Montreal.  The smoked meat sandwich, the crunch burger and the smoked meat poutine were amazing.  The restaurant has a full bar and the specialty drinks were great.  The best part of my meal was the carrot cake which was the best I have ever had.  Definitely worth visiting."}
{"text":"Les crêpes et les ufs sont cuits à la perfection et l'incontournable demeure la viande fumée. Elle est tellement bonne qu'on peut en redemander d'autres et le gâteau au fromage est tellement délicieux. L'hôtesse du matin est tellement gentille... Elle me reconnaît souvent quand j'y vais..."}
{"text":"From San Diego to Montréal. I of course had to try the local foods. So after a quick yelp search i ended up here. The bartender was quite personable and helped me with my selection. I tried a small smoked meat sandwich with a side of poutine. Honestly smoked meat was not my favorite. Maybe a regional thing. The poutine had the bbq meat which was pretty tasty. I would go back for the poutine, but i'll leave the smoked meats to the locals."}
{"text":"3.5  A proper place to try smoked meat. Different from Dunn's (more gelatineous, but not too much). Salads are Ok, but not more.  Everything is OK, but not waoooh at all. Probably standard and consistent in its quality."}
{"text":"We looked for a place for a quick lunch and we stumbled upon Reuben's. Had some pretty good Yelp reviews so in we went. As a New Yorker, I was brought up on delis and diners and was excited to try this one. The menu had a little bit of everything so between the four of us, we had a schizophrenic table. We were told that when in Montreal, we must have a smoked meat sandwich so that is what I ordered. It was good, not great, but good. The lunch special comes with a soup and I really enjoyed the lentil. It was a generous portion. My daughter ordered poutine and it was also good.  My husband had a pasta dish that he liked and my son had a chicken entree that he couldn't finish. The decor is pretty basic and the waitstaff fine.  It is a pretty large restaurant and it got busy pretty quickly.  I can see this being a popular late night place. Not a bad place to check out!"}
{"text":"After hours of shopping on Sainte-Catherine street, your stomach should be rewarded with protein fuel. You walk by Reuben's and ingots of smoked meat are lying there staring at you through the windows like puppies in a pet store. You can't take it anymore. The entrance door is pulled.   The interior is very woodsy which evokes the idea of a nice smoky barbecue. The illuminated bottles of liquor on the shelves and the walls of wine show that this place isn't taking it lightly. My waiter was a friendly and rotund man that remained very professional throughout the whole time. I had the obvious intentions to try the smoked meat but another item on the menu caught my attention - kobe sliders. It didn't take too long before they brought me the 3 miniature hamburgers. Juicy tomatoes, tangy pickles, and beefy wagyu, it was simple but tasty. Although, the patties were a bit dry and they could have been more juicy considering the fact that wagyu beef has more fat and marbling.   Overall, it was a decently good experience and I'd definitely return to get my hands on the smoked meat sandwiches that everyone is raving about."}
{"text":"Great smoke meat! Location is ok and staff is welcoming. I recommend the original 76 which is a bagel with smoked meat with swiss cheese and mustard"}
{"text":"Great family friendly restaurant for breakfast lunch or dinner. Which there seems to be a lack of downtown.This is our first visit to Montreal we stayed for 3 days and ended up eating here 3 times , twice for breakfast and once for dinner. Very friendly staff and excellent service. The portions are huge my daughter and son shared pancakes and still didn't finish them. They also have some amazing desserts."}
{"text":"Huge portions of smoked meat. If you're in this part of town, need to eat in a hurry, and wanted a taste of what the famed smoked meat was about, then Reuben's Deli isn't a bad choice.  The vinegar-based cole slaw is excellent and sorely needed to cut all the grease and fat in the smoked meat sandwich. Get one sandwich and split it with a friend."}
{"text":"Bien placé, juste à côté du travail pour moi. L'ambiance est top, j'aime le design intérieur. Par contre, je trouve l'endroit très bruyant.  Les burgers y sont parfaits - je recommande le Road House... - mais les sandwichs et les salades laissent à désirer.  Le service est impeccable, la serveuse se préoccupait beaucoup de savoir si nous souhaitions plus d'eau, des sauces, etc.  En tout cas, on en ressort la panse bien remplie, je ne prononcerais donc pas sur les desserts, je n'ai jamais pu en prendre.  Les prix sont un peu elevés aussi. On paye sans doute l'emplacement."}
{"text":"Amazing smoked meat sandwiches! This is a QC delicacy and must be tried when you are in town, of course being a meat and sandwich lover helps. They pile the meat so high you can barely fit the sandwich in your mouth without dislocating your jaw. Drool.... need I say more?"}
{"text":"Reuben's has become, over the years, one of my favorite breakfast stops in Montreal for a St. Viature bagel, creme cheese, lox, red onion, cucumber, tomato and capers. Something about the bagel and especially the lox, we don't seemed to have the same salmon quality here in the states. I have had lunch  and dinner there as well, the service is always good as is the food quality; the prices are very reasonable. I don't believe you can good wrong stopping in for a nosh when visiting Montreal."}
{"text":"I agree on the prices. I once asked for a side salad with my sandwich (forgot now which sandwich I ordered) and it was like 6 something dollars! I don't want the huge salad, just a side salad. They should really have an option a little less expensive for a side salad if someone doesn't want the fries to accompany a sandwich.  Next thing, and this is just me, but they put waaaaaay too much meat in the sandwiches. I took most of it out, actually.   I'm ordering out from here today for lunch with a co-worker and this time I think I might try one of their main-meal salads.   Return Worthy... once in a while. ;-)  Thanks for reading!"}
{"text":"Great smoked meat sandwiches with huge portions.  I agree with Elle P. you are better off splitting this puppy with a friend. The french fries were a bit of the lacklustre side and tasted like McCain's fires that had been left out.  The service was super quick and friendly.  I would definitely go again but I would skip the fries"}
{"text":"Corned beef poutine was terrible. Lacked a lot of flavor. The price is outrageous for the quality and taste. I have no idea why people are recommending others to try it. Do not try it, unless you're sick, cannot taste anything, and/or like bland food. I had 3 bites, corned beef on its own, fries gravy and cheese on its own and then together, to give it a chance, and I just could not eat anymore. I love poutines, and I would not try again nor recommend."}
{"text":"I stopped by Reuben's to eat today as I had relatives visiting and it's one of their favourite restaurants. There are two locations in Montreal. I do not believe that they are affiliated, but this one is much nicer. It's always very clean and the service is always excellent. You can tell that the servers are trained very well. During the evenings (especially on weekends), I would suggest making a reservation because the wait times can be pretty long if you have a bigger party. There's also rarely parking on rue Sainte-Catherine, so I would suggest walking.   My only issue with this restaurant is the lack of options for vegetarians and vegans. Even most of their salads aren't vegetarian. Obviously I don't expect them to have a menu accommodating such requests, but an option or two would be a good idea for people like me who end up having to pay around $20.00 for a salad after removing half of the ingredients. Although pricey, the menu is awesome for those without any sort of restrictions. And from the looks of everyone's meals, you seem to get what you pay for.   I would definitely recommend this restaurant to any non-restrictive eater looking for a nice place to go. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Great service, great food can't ask for more.    Had the smoked meat twice and they were both fantastic each time.  My wife had the fish and it was cooked really well.    Would definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great deli atmosphere and friendly staff add to the great deli food at Reuben's. I have to admit that I was not expecting to find much but was pleasantly surprised with the modern decor and quality selections on the menu.  Highly recommend Reuben's poutine which is topped with corned beef. It comes as an appetizer but can easily be eaten as an entree. Salads were as green as they come and the portions were huge. Traditional deli sandwiches did not disappoint. I was most impressed by the bubbly waitress who served our group - she could not have been nicer or more helpful!  Unfortunately any egg dishes are not served past 11 am, and there is no matzo ball soup on the menu?"}
{"text":"Food taste is great. It was noisy this week and the waiter get us the wrong invoice. However, the experience is really worth the cost and waiting time to get in"}
{"text":"Got here past midnight and this place still had quite a few people inside. I got their super sandwich that came with fries, coleslaw, and pickles (they should probably clarify that in their menu since the 'Smoked Meat' was the only section on the menu that didn't say that :P).  The meat was very tender and tasty. I have tried Schwartz and Main a couple years back but I'll have to try it again to compare. I would definitely come back here to try their meat again! And their meat poutine was pretty good too. I really liked the thickness of the fries. It was relatively thin so the fries were crispy, but not too thin. However, I wasn't the biggest fan of their coleslaw and rye bread. The coleslaw had too much water/juice at the bottom so I had to drain it before eating. And the rye bread felt pretty chewy."}
{"text":"Reuben's for DESSERT! Okay so we ONLY went there for dessert, so please keep that in mind when reading this review.  We arrived late at night, and we'd had a late lunch so just wanted something naughty before bed.  We told the host we were just here for dessert and we were sat at the bar.  We ordered two bars drinks (cognac and a raspberry martini) after the suggestions from the bartender.  We looked at the desserts in the case and on the menu, and decided on the Chocolate Bomb!  Oh was it a lot of food!  We were going to order a dessert each, but were so glad we didn't after we had this one... though the other dessert I wanted, the Apple Crumble with French Vanilla ice cream, looked amazing!  The bartender was very very busy, but was polite and seemed to be efficient in his tasks.  The manager was very friendly (we spoke with him a bit) and the general ambiance was very nice.  I'd love to have a dinner there.  I noticed some nice-looking pasta dishes, and a Reuben sandwich on some tables.  The restaurant was very busy this time of night, which is nice considering most restaurants were closed at this time on a Sunday night.  Also, Reuben's is located centrally downtown, so that's a plus."}
{"text":"I know the big place for smoked meat is Schwartz's, but it's a little bit out of the way from the main downtown area. We chose to try Reuben's because the location worked a lot better for us. Since it is located near the main shopping area on Rue Sainte-Catherine Ouest, it was super busy when we visited on a Sunday afternoon around 1 PM. Everyone working there seems to speak very good English compared to a lot of places, and I believe that might be because a lot of the patrons are tourists. Although there were a lot of people inside, they moved through the queue pretty quickly, and it didn't feel like we had to wait more than 10 minutes to be seated in a booth.  Our waitress was super nice and friendly, and came around at regular intervals to check if we needed drink refills or wanted any water. Between three people, we ordered the Original Reuben Sandwich ($15.99), the Turkey Melt ($13.99), and the Chop-Chop Poutine ($9.49). The prices are considered pretty high for lunch, but the portions you get are SO HUGE. The Reuben sandwich comes with 1/2 lb. of smoked meat inside! We were all incredibly stuffed after our meal. We all enjoyed the Reuben sandwich and agreed that the smoked meat was great, it was moist, flavourful, and very hearty and filling. The turkey melt on the other hand was just okay though, the turkey was actually a little bit dry and I wasn't as impressed with it. The poutine was fantastic though. It comes topped with cheese curds as usual but also with chunks of smoked meat brisket, which really add another level of flavour to the poutine overall. The saltiness of the meat mixes so well with the cheese and gravy... so so delicious. Poutine + smoked meat, it's like killing two birds with one stone... it just doesn't get any more authentic Montreal than this! I will say that by the end of it, it started to feel a little bit too salty though. But overall I still thoroughly enjoyed the poutine and would recommend trying it if you are at Reuben's!  I thought the decor was also really cute. It's got kind of an old school diner vibe, albeit much shinier and in a much more commercialized way. It's pretty big and spacious though, and you will feel comfortable while eating there. Although I still want to give Schwartz's a try, I can attest that you won't go wrong by choosing to eat at Reuben's. The smoked meat is great, the service is great, and the environment is great!"}
{"text":"Stop in for lunch during a day trip to Montreal. Had the steak and chips with mashed potatoes. It was delicious! I was alone and the waitress was very friendly and helpful. Would definitely visit when I am in the city again!"}
{"text":"This is what a Reuben sandwich should look and taste like. I have been to too many places where you get the sandwich and the sandwich looks sad and small. This is legit. Lots of tasty meat open late too!!!"}
{"text":"Rueben's specializes in delicacy typical to my hometown of NYC: smoked meat. It's similar to our pastrami, except that brisket it used leading to a slightly fatty end product. I found it to be lighter and less salty than most New York renditions and must admit I generally prefer this style. The traditional serving is with mustard on rye, where it comes piled mile high (whoops, wrong city). The \"small\" clocks in at 10 oz while the Big Bang weighs a full pound and towers almost six inches off the plate. You probably shouldn't finish either alone. Other versions include a classic Reuben with sauerkrat and swiss as well as a must try poutine edition. The space resembles sort of a cross between a bar and diner that's suitable for a hefty lunch or casual dinner.  Recommended: Famous Super Sandwich, Reuben's Chop-Chop Poutine"}
{"text":"Hip and nice steakhouse in town, portion is enormous but I blame getting poutine for appetizers.  If you're going to get Montreal smoke meat and steak, I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Large place that was packed with a quick turnover tho (didn't feel rushed however). Had the regular \"famous\" Mtl smoked meat sandwich with the shoestring fries and it was excellent. My buddies had burgers and thought the same. A good variety of beers on tap. Bit of a wait for a table on a Saturday afternoon, but that's to be expected. Table, food and bill all arrived in a timely manner. If you want a place to hang out for a leisurely meal and have some wine and chat, this is not the place for you. Go there. Eat. It's good!"}
{"text":"I thought this was going to be a diner-type place but it's much more fancy than I expected. It's more like Kelsey's or Moxie's than anything. I decided on the Original 76', and when it came my jaw dropped because the portions here are MASSIVE. It was very well-presented and the smoked meat was delicious. This is one of the iconic, must-visit places of Montreal even if it wasn't the best restaurant I went to in Montreal. The food came a little slow, but the place was busy so it was understandable."}
{"text":"After receiving several personal recommendations to try this place out for their smoked meat sandwich I was disappointed that they their Traditional Smoked Meat is served on a brioche bun and not a sourdough. The waitress did not allow any substitutions nor was she helpful in making any recommendations. When the food finally arrived it was mediocre - nothing special. I would definitely look elsewhere to get your smoked meat fix."}
{"text":"Un autre classique à ne pas manquer. Comme François D, je dois avouer adorer le smoke meat de Reuben's. J'y suis allé à plusieurs reprises au cours des années, et à chaque fois j'y ai commandé quelque chose avec de smoke meat (la pizza, le sandwich classique, le \"club roll\", etc.) J'aime que la viande soit bien tendre et humide sans nécessairement être grasse. Elle est tranchée très mince et j'adore. Puis pour l'endroit comme tel est très bien. C'est central, grand, chaleureux et propre. Le service est généralement agréable et il y a même des sièges à l'entrée pour les fois où l'attente doit durer plus de quelques seconds. La seule chose que je n'aime pas, c'est qu'ils ne prennent pas de cartes débit même s'ils acceptent les cartes de crédit. Un peu à l'envers à mon avis."}
{"text":"I tried the Original Reuben's and loved it! The smoked meat and pumpernickel bread went perfectly together. I had to wait about 45 minutes on a Saturday afternoon but it was well worth the wait."}
{"text":"Great service but eh-ok food  Personally, smoked sandwiches are not my thing but since I only had it once, I decided to try again just to be more open minded (?). It was a bit dissapointing. We took the Reuben's famous strawberry cheesecake and honestly it wasn't that good. There was no crust, it was literally all soft cream cheese and being someone who loves carbs, that was a bit of a let down. Afterwards, I got a huge roast beef sandwich and it came with some coleslaw and a pile of fries and everything was bland and even the meat wasn't that tender/soft. Some parts were even tough.  Overall, the food was okay more quantity rather than quality and a bit pricey as well!   Don't know if i'd come again but I can see why some people like it!"}
{"text":"Smoked meat & poutine in the same place?! How can you not love it already?! They take time with everything on their menu. It's as if they are preparing the I last meal on earth. The delicacy that they serve is just amazing.  From their breakfast to their dinner menu. PURE PERFECTION. If it's your first time stopping by I would suggest The Original (Smoked Meat) Sandwich.   Did I mention their bakery is really good too?   The prices may seem to the expensive side but once you taste the food and experience the service. You'll understand it's fair."}
{"text":"??????4??? ???Montreal ?????????????????????????????????????yelp ???????????Montreal smoked meat sandwich.  ???????????????????????? ???????????????????????????????????????????????????????? ??????????????? ??????Montreal ??????? Note: ??????????17??????4?????60+????????????????????????."}
{"text":"Not that it matters, but there are two separate Reuben's deli along Rue Sainte-Catherine Ouest within a couple blocks of each other. I am sure that today's visit was at the closer to Rue Peel, which is smack in the middle of the shopping district crowds.  Of course, I had the smoked meat. Why have anything else? It comes piled medium high on rye bread with mustard and swiss cheese, with a big pile of fries, a pot of cole slaw and a pickle. It was good, but I'll be honest, I prefer spicy brown mustard to the yellow mustard they offer here. No worries, it was still excellent and a whole lot of food. Too much to be able to even consider splitting a piece of the delicious looking carrot cake.  Prices are moderate, but it's a fancy sit down restaurant with real service and tablecloths.   Don't tell anyone, but smoked meat is a whole lot similar to pastrami."}
{"text":"Good but not great.  Portions are huge, but its also a bit pricier than some of the other places that serves the same food.  We called ahead for a party of 10 and we tucked in the corner of the restaurant.  I was happy they were able to accommodate us, as the place was packed with post game fans.  Everyone seemed to enjoy their food, but I thought their smoked meats were a bit saltier than their competitor Dunn's.  I actually didn't want to finish my meal because it was so salty.  I would recommend this place for the ambiance.  Its a great place if you need a place to hang with friends.  4 generous stars for this visit."}
{"text":"My wife and I had lunch here on her birthday. We sat at the bar and shared a Rueben Sandwich. It was everything I could have hoped. The french fries that came with our sandwich were only average. The bartender was very attentive, helpful and kind."}
{"text":"The Super Famous didn't disappoint and no one left hungry.  We were told the Smoked Meat sandwich was a \"must eat\" in Montreal.  Very happy that we stopped here.  Very memorable."}
{"text":"I know this is a smoke meat place and I was on a diet smoke meat was not on my menu. I ordered a BBQ chicken sandwich.  These meals they serve are big.  With mountains of fries. I had not been to a Ruebens since I was a kid and they sure upgraded the place. But the food is not like the good ole days. Fries were the frozen type and I still love the real McCoy instead of these frozen fries. My sandwich was good but all I tasted was BBQ sauce and my hands smelled like BBQ sauce for the next 2 days.  There were 2 types of cheese but could not tell there was even cheese. Shame as the bread was really good. Service was excellent.  I will go back and try the smoke meat and probably give 5 star."}
{"text":"Walked by this place several times, and my boyfriend and I decided to give it a shot on our last morning in Montreal.   The place was clean and big. Everyone was super friendly. Our server was very nice and quick - within 3 minutes of us being seated, we had already gotten our drinks and food order out.  The wait on the food was a little bit long, but the place was busy so I'm guessing that was why.  Our food came and was presented well on the plate.  My boyfriend was a little bit annoyed because he was hungry, and as I said the wait was a little long; when he had tried our fries, they were no longer hot, they had for sure been sitting for awhile.  Food was still good, I obviously couldn't finish the entire thing because the portions were huge! Absolutely nothing wrong with that, I saved my other half to bring back to Toronto.  Even eating the sandwich the next day, it was still good.  I'll be trying this place again when we do come back, there were some other items on the menu that caught my eye."}
{"text":"Pretty bad experience here. Very high prices, dismal cocktail menu, rude staff.   Nothing here for vegetarians that isn't some bullshit $18 zucchini sandwich."}
{"text":"We came here on a Friday night for a relatively early dinner (read: 6:30pm) for our habitual Friday night date night. We'd been here before, and have always been satisfied with the food/service. We were seated right away, and they accommodated our request for a booth. The only \"downer\" are the prices; they've been raised since I was there the last time, and for the type of restaurant I don't know if they're warranted. But hey, it's downtown Montreal, it's to be expected!  Our waiter was by almost immediately to get our drink order. He was very nice and welcoming. He gave us a few more minutes to look at the menu and came back to get our food order. We started with the spinach and cheese dip, and I had the Bandara chicken sandwich with fries, while my boyfriend had the smoked meat with mashed potatoes. The food service was timely and convenient. Our spinach dip was delicious and hot; a nice blend of cheeses with some spinach. I'm a big fan of spinach dips, and this one ranks pretty highly in my books. We had enough time to somewhat digest the appetizer before our main dishes came out. Our plates came out, and I was excited to dig in. The Bandara chicken sandwich, in a word, was delish! The sweet BBQ sauce with the crispy onions and the sourdough bread; oh man! The portion was huge, so I was able to benefit from a second meal out of the other half of my meal. My boyfriend had the smoked meat, and says it was ok, but not the best he's had. When you've been to Schwartz's, it's hard to find somewhere that will top it! I had a taste and I'll admit it wasn't the best smoked meat I've ever had, but it wasn't terrible; it was edible and did the trick.   So if you're looking for a decent lunch or diner spot, and are in the golden square mile, I would recommend Reuben's, and would definitely say get the Bandara Chicken Sandwich! Worth every bite!"}
{"text":"We were seated, ordered and served our dinner quickly. I had an aged meat rib eye steak that was  not tender and had lots of gristle in the steak,not much flavor. The mashed potatoes were thin and watered down.  I have eaten aged meats before and it was very different experience, tender and tasty.My companion had a sandwich,  Delmonico that had more tasty and tender meat than my steak.  Stick with the sandwiches, the steaks are not worth the added expense.   The restaurant was very busy and I opted not to complain about the meal.  However I should have because I and my companion both ended up with intestinal distress 2 hrs after the meal, even though we both had different meals."}
{"text":"Used to come here all the time when I worked across the street but still roll through every now and again when I'm craving a great sandwich platter done perfectly. I used to stick with the brisket but lately their burgers have been off the hook. All the buns are baked fresh that morning and sourced from a local MTL bakery, all the beef aged and of good quality, and all of their sauces and marinades are done in house. Its a family business and an MTL institution so they know exactly what they're doing.   Last time I was there I wanted to get a burger to go since I was staying nearby and the manager Mike was really helpful in going through the menu with me. Told me about their Toronto expansion which should get all GTA brisket/pastrami lovers excited. Great food, attentive and friendly service, smart management, really the swankiest and nicest smoked meat joint in the city - if not the country."}
{"text":"The smoked meat sandwich made me want to weep with joy. People who say there is too much meat on the sandwich just don't understand, man. If you can't question where the bread has disappeared to, your sandwich place ain't trying hard enough.  One star down because I didn't really care for the slaw--it had a weird taste to it. Could be my weird Australian taste buds... but the sandwich tasted juuuuuust fine. I'm gonna dream about that meat for the rest of my life."}
{"text":"This place is quite tastey.  The portions are huge, you can definately split an entree.  The second best pastrami sandwich I've ever had, but well above average none the less!  It's worth a trip for lunch if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Love this place. Great location and great food. Try the Reuben.... Best thing on their menu."}
{"text":"Famous smoke meat sandwich was terrific.  Substituted poutine for fries.  Poutine was good, not write home great.  Staff was superb, atmosphere pleasant, prices reasonable.  Went earlier in the evening, no wait.  All fine."}
{"text":"These guys get it right. Their classic Reuben on a brioche bun is out of this world. They ask how you want the meat. Lean, medium or fatty. I ordered medium and the mixed meat (corned beef and pastrami) was melt in my mouth delicious. In my opinion a deli has to get it all right. That includes pickles, cole slaw and French fries. 5 stars for all. Rueben's also offers a full menu of steaks and other meats. If you are looking for classic deli with a diverse offering of great food this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"Passed by several other stops to go here based on Yelp reviews and was disappointed.  Mediocre food at best, service was good as were prices but wouldn't recommend."}
{"text":"Very disappointing...just ate here for lunch.....I'm a born Montrealer and have been eating Montreal smoked meat for over 50 years. Last time I ate here was 2 years ago and it was excellent...but today was just terrible. Smoked meat was very bland almost tasteless and very soft and mushy, almost slimy. The rye bread had no substance to it so you couldn't actually pick-up the sandwich , had to resort to a fork. Fries were cold,limp and no crispiness to them at all. Tuna sandwich .....well it wasn't worth the 12 bucks. Actually this pace is grossly overpriced for the quality of the food. Even Snowdon deli has better smoked meat...and that isn't saying much."}
{"text":"This was our last stop before leaving Montreal and it was disappointing! We got the mac & cheese, original sandwich and a burger. The noodles in the mac & cheese were almost as if they were from a box and they just put smoked meat on it. I was really not a huge fan of the mac & cheese. The original sandwich was just okay. It was nothing special. I may have been spoiled from having the smoked meat sandwich from Schwartz the day before, but I was not impressed. The burger was my favorite of all! I loved the bread that it came in and it was a good sized burger.  Overall, I really was not impressed. For the price, I really expected more out of the place. I definitely would not recommend you go to the place for a smoked meat experience. There are many different deli's such as Schwartz near the area for a much cheaper price and better quality. I'm providing the three stars for service, the burger and the ambiance of the place.  **UPDATE** Per the comment from the business owner, the review I posted is associated with the correct establishment."}
{"text":"Reuben's is located in the touristy part of downtown, explaining why it is quite expensive.   The ambiance is nice, and the place was very busy on a weekday lunch hour.   Our service was dry, rushed, and left much to be desired.  I asked for the beef special from the Business Lunch Menu.  It was pulled beef tacos, which were very tasty, and the sauce was delicious.  However for $18, it was 3 very tiny tacos and a side salad.   They were something from the appetizers menu.      Our lemonade was also $4; I can get a pint elsewhere for 1-2 dollars more!  Overpriced, overhyped, and the service is meh."}
{"text":"I've been here twice so far and I love it. Upscale atmosphere, delicious smoked corn beef. Only downside is it's a bit loud. I've been getting either the 10 oz or the 16 oz sandwiches and eating them without the bread. The portions are generous enough I always have some for later."}
{"text":"This restaurant is diner style but totally awesome. If you are on a keto diet: smoked meat platter, mustard, and dill pickles is the way to go. You definitely get your monies worth...couldn't finish a whole platter with out my husband's help.  The smoked meat was YUMMY. I was really tempted to try their strawberry cheesecake. Maybe next time."}
{"text":"We were told about this place by some of the locals and they were spot on.   We were lucky enough to grab 3 seats at the bar so we got to talk with the bar staff, who were terrific.   The draft selection is OK, not great.   We had their signature meat sandwich and sliders, both were about the best I've ever had.   We also had the Apple dissert....oh boy.   The place was crazy busy when we were leaving at 5:30, get there early."}
{"text":"We were starving! Ordered the super deli sandwich and the short rib poutine. Both were awesome!!! Lots of flavour and a healthy helping. Will definitely be back.  The dessert look great also but didn't get to try as they were closing."}
{"text":"Just ordinary food and don't like their smoke meat, also tried chicken, don't like it either"}
