{"text":"Cora's is a cozy store. It definitely caught my senses- it's bright orange sign and smells of delicious freshly baked carbs! I've only tried their vegan love loaf and loved it! My sister had their chocolate walnut cookie and pizza and it did not disappoint."}
{"text":"I find this place like hit and miss. There are times when their cupcake is  good and other times cupcake is tasteless. Like one time I bought a chocolate cupcake and when I bite into it, icing was hard and the cupcake was very dry. It was 3 dollars too. :/ I tried variety of flavours of cupcakes and  none of them really stand out from grocery cupcakes."}
{"text":"The place is too cute!, and they re vegan gulten free brownie was really good........though their..coffee not so much but eh liking 2 out of 3 things about the place isin't bad. I love vegan desserts and I really want to get back out there soon to try their cupcakes, I think that the cupcakes alone will be the deciding factor on wheather or not I LOVE the place forsure or not."}
{"text":"Stopped by this little shoppe today for a little treat and grabbed some mini flourless chocolate tortes. Soooooo yums! Light, moist, chocolately and not overly sweet - almost melt in your mouth. Wish I had gotten more! I'll definitely be back to try their other lovely desserts!
Besides baked goods, they also have a selection of savoury dishes such as sandwiches and salads."}
{"text":"I've only ever had the mini-cupcakes from this adorable Kensington Market bakery, but they sure are mega-delicious! Available in chocolate, vanilla, lemon, and carrot cake (with amazingly rich cream cheese icing) for $1.50 a piece, they truly are heavenly little creations. And because they're so small, you can eat more of them without feeling guilty! You're definitely best to order yourself a whole dozen and try out every flavour!"}
{"text":"Delightful baked goods - chocolate, vanilla, and carrot cupcakes all delicious, and come in bite-size portions. The icing is rich and tasty, not your typical sugar-paste.

The butter tart's crust-to-filling ratio was off (too much crust) but still tasty. Well worth a visit!

The brownie cupcake was really satisfying, with a soft, truffle-like centre. Watch out for these ones!"}
{"text":"I read about this place several times and I had to come in and experience Miss Cora's baked goods.  Small and quaint...well suited for the area.  A little suprised about the prices of the cupcakes...$1.50 for a mini cupcakes (two-bite size) and $3.00 for a regular cupcake. At these prices the cupcakes better be good.  Unfortunately, the cupcakes did not live up to their price.  Not much variety in flavours...red velvet, chocolate, carrot and vanilla.  Their cupcakes are all refrigerated. I waited until the cupcakes were room temperature before I tried them. I can tell they use butter and cream cheese in their sugar frosting, but nothing extraordinary.  The cake was too heavy and a little oily.  These cupcakes did not make me smile :(."}
{"text":"Fresh Fresh Fresh...Now easily one on my favorite new places to stop in for a treat or lunch. Originally I discovered Cora's at an event at ING DIRECT's new cafe where they catered an amazing spread and a colleague boasted about how good of a business they were.

All day the super friendly staff are slicing, baking and creating the very originally made treats right in front of you in an open cozy little kitchen at the back. I tried the Gourmet Pizza 2x now and for $3.50 a slice it is a steal, really! When I Foursquare checked in I got a big twitter and Facebook response, one saying try the crepe omelette's and the other saying she was close by working and hoped I could bring her some treats...so I did. Come by and tell em Jarvis Sent you :)"}
{"text":"I've been on a cupcake craving all week and since I was just around the corner from Miss Cora's Kitchen, I just had to try the cupcakes everyone is raving about from here.

When you walk through the door, it's a small place. You have to pick up the cupcakes yourself (the ones in the fridge), which I found kind of off and difficult at first (considering I had my hands full of groceries). Plus, they weren't the easiest things to get out of the cupcake pans. They're pricey too, 3 dollars for a cupcake that seems very small at first compared to other bakeries. NOTE: THIS PLACE ONLY ACCEPTS CASH, no debit or credit, thank god I had enough change! 

I was kind of skeptical to try the cupcakes, considering the price, size, and how they were placed in the bakery....but, once you take your first bite, THESE ARE THE BEST CUPCAKES I HAVE TRIED THIS WHOLE WEEK! I'll definitely be returning to get more cupcakes when I'm around Kensington Market.

Totally worth 3 dollars per cupcake!"}
{"text":"Update: Yep, Miss Cora continues to rawk. Hers are *the* chocolate chip cookies. Hers are *the* flourless chocolate cupcakes. Her pizza by the slice is fresh, creative, and delicious. Really, you can't go wrong here. Point and shoot. Order anything and it'll be awesome. Add the reliably smily, friendly service and the tunes coming from an actual, real record player and it's a delightful business to patronise."}
{"text":"I love a good chocolate chip cookie more than just about anything. The cookues produced in a tiny little shop on Kennsington are the best I've had in quite some time. They remind me of the cookies my grandmother used to make. Each one is 2$ but this is a substantial cookie, and I think well worth the price. The high price also helps prevent immediate, frenzied multiple purchases. The cookie itself is moist yet breaks apart pleasingling in your mouth.  There is a significant chocolate presence without becoming overpowering and dominating the flavor of the non-chocolate portion if the cookie.  They use fresh ingredients and you can taste the difference immediately."}
{"text":"They make most of the baked goods for Tango Cafe on Queen East.  The quiche is really good and the crust is awesome.  Got some blueberry scones fresh from the oven.  Delicious."}
{"text":"In my defense, I gave them a second chance first.

The first time I had Miss Cora's, I tried the cupcakes - red velvet and a white one (vanilla?). The cupcakes were dense, but rather oily and with the icing the overall package was too sweet without offering nearly enough (for either the calories or the prices).

The second time I thought I'd go for something less rich, and so I tried the vegan love cake. Apparently it was one of their best-sellers, but at $4 for a muffin, I was shocked to find that it tasted only marginally better than a Tim Horton's muffin. And judging by sweetness and oiliness, I wouldn't think that it's much more healthy either. I'm pretty sure that the average google-able recipe for vegan carrot cake/muffin will yield a comparable product to Miss Cora's. I suspect this is another one of those cases where it only sells based on Kensington demand for hipster (veg) food.

Sigh. I'm sorry Miss Cora's. I would only ever come back if it's free."}
{"text":"Wow. 
Best Lemon Meringue Pie I've ever had. 
Meringue was light and fluffy and tasted like clouds...lemon was light, slighty tart, not very sweet and the pie crust was crumbly  and buttery...perfect little mini pie. I'd have it again in a heartbeat. 
The Choc Chip Cookie was buttery and yummy...will be back!"}
{"text":"I went to Miss Cora's for her cupcakes. I read somewhere on the inter webs that their cupcakes were delicious and one of the best in Toronto.

So I took on this mission, trekked over and asked for half a dozen cupcakes. To my disappointment, they were sitting in a refrigerator when I entered the shop. I was hesitant to complete my mission after seeing them, all huddled up close, waiting, and dying in the fridge. I tried them anyways. Two red velvet, two chocolate and two vanilla. They were around 3 dollars each. 

To my further disappointment, the icing was crusted and hard when I took my first bite. The red velvet didn't taste like what a red velvet should taste like. The cupcakes themselves were mediocre at best. Not moist but crumbly and semi-dry. I think it was the fridge.

Perhaps cupcakes are one of few things that Cora's fails at but they offer it openly and served it out of a fridge. 

Say what you will, they probably do taste good when you luck out and arrive with fresh cupcakes. The odds of that are slim.

Overall, I didn't like Cora's after that failed mission. Tainted by hard icing,  my dreams will now always be haunted."}
{"text":"I have to say everytime I'm in Kensington I stop at Miss Cora's for a flourless chocolate cupcake. The most delicious things ever! Love the carrot cupcakes, too. Keep on keeping on, Miss Cora. You rock!"}
{"text":"7 layer bar is to die for. Super friendly people. Loved it"}
{"text":"Miss Cora makes the most delicious flourless chocolate (cup)cake in Toronto. The mini cupcakes are fun too. This spot is a gem just waiting to be discovered :)"}
{"text":"Meandered over here after a nice meal on Baldwin Street, and were greeted enthusiastically by a woman on her bike just outside the store who was raving about the freshly baked tarts.  We ordered a few of the red velvet cupcakes, which were delicious, and sat on the tiny wooden chairs just outside the store to enjoy them.  We were actually served by Miss Cora at the cash register, and then watched her go around the back to take out the trash.  Pretty impressive to see a store owner do everything from bake the cupcakes, manage the register and take out the trash!"}
{"text":"We've been regular customers of Miss Cora's Kitchen for catering jobs for 6 people to 150 people since 2005. 

We love that she can whip up canap√©s on very short notice (even though we feel bad when we give her little notice). 

Her bites always have a great mouthfeel - comfort food with boho chic 'market fresh' ingredients. 

From sweet to savory - we've enjoyed absolutely everything we've every had from Miss Cora. You will too :-)"}
{"text":"I bought a bunch of the mini cupcakes for a birthday gathering, and thought they were pretty average for the most part. The one exception being the pink velvet, which was very, very good."}
{"text":"Bought a dozen of the mini cupcakes with my friend the other day. Slightly expensive, but they were delicious. My favourite was the red velvet cupcakes. Great little treat."}
{"text":"I was shopping for veggies in one of the kensingston's good ol' produce shops when I heard these two girls go on and on about these cupcakes. So I was like, hey, must be good? I could use a cupcake ! and on the way back to my car I stopped in and grabbed 2 - red velvet and vanilla.

I wanted to be vowed! the shop looked so homey and everything on the chalk board style menu looked so fresh and yum, first thing we did that evening was after dinner, come home, and sink out teeth into that yummy cupcake I'd so carefully held onto on my way so the icing doesn't get smashed.

Oh, how disappointed I was! the cake part was nothing special - semi dry and felt like came out of the freezer. The icing? even worse. Too sugary, not enough cream cheese (like typical red velvet cupcake). I've had fancy cupcakes and paid close to $4.50 a piece for those but this??? I wanted my $3 back!

the vanilla came next and it was surprizingly better than the \"red velvet\" (I put it in quotes as the flavor was NOT red velvet) but , that being said, they were lame excuses for an overpriced piece of cake.

I'm so sad..in the meantime, my quest for the perfect cupcake in Toronto continues..."}
{"text":"I have been on a cupcake  crawl with my sister for the last couple of weeks and in my googling, came across Miss Cora's in Kensington many times as having great ones. So today, we went all the way down to the market and the first thing we did, was pop in and get half a dozen mini to go.There were some in the fridge but we go the \"fresh\"  ones or at least that's what the counter people assured us. We got carrot, red velvet and vanilla (only ones they had).They certainly looked cute and had little sprinkles and decorations on top. My almost 3 year old (reason for cupcake hunt as it's her birthday soon) wanted to eat hers right now but I made her wait til after lunch.
We hit Empanadas and enjoyed delicious as always empanadas.Then my sister, my husband, my daughter and I all grabbed a cupcake each. I lunged at red velvet. EW! It was dry&crumbly and the frosting was thick,too sweet and grainy. The cake itself didn't taste like red velvet but was oily. The carrot cake was oily too and had raisins. Basically a muffin with icing. The vanilla was absolutely the worst and was thrown out as was the second red velvet. The vanilla was hard, dense and tasted like bread. The icing tasted like icing sugar icing and was just gross. 
I seriously don't understand why anyone likes these cupcakes? The oil is obvious in all and maybe since they don't use butter? I don't know the answer to why they are so bad but I have had other vegan cupcakes like the cupcaketionary that taste good. These were so bad I wanted to cry in disappointment. 
My daughter didn't even lick all the icing off as she  normally does and spit out her bite of red velvet. What 3 year old does that to a cupcake?
All in all, so far the worst I have had in TO, even worse than Lollicakes who I disliked. Sobeys and Loblaw ones are WAAAAY better than these."}
{"text":"Since moving into the Alexandra Park 'hood about a month ago, I've become a regular at the fruit and veggie markets and Cobs bakery in Kensington.  I discovered Miss Cora's while making my way home from Cobs with bread in hand one day last week and felt the most unimaginable draw from the delicious goodies in the window.  I deserved a treat!  This was the BEST DECISION EVER and have been back again now. 

Both times I've popped in, I've been greeted warmly by the lovely bakers and had a cupcake - first, a mini cuppie and a few days ago a proper cupcake.  Both were melt-in-your-mouth delicious!  I also nibbled on the sample of brownie sitting on the counter: heavenly!  The prices also seem reasonable: the $1.50 for a mini cupcake was perhaps a little more than I was expecting but made up for by the price of the regular size ($3).  

Why aren't I giving a coveted 5 stars?  Well, I want to hold that extra star until I've had a greater breadth of their products.  Also, I'm not sure of their hours; I searched for a solid 5 minutes outside while trying to eat my cupcake yesterday (which was difficult while holding an umbrella between my shoulder and jaw).  Yes, you're right, I could have just asked, but that would have been way too easy!  I like my information right out in front of my face."}
{"text":"The website for Miss Cora's Kitchen references a piece on them by Blog.to and asks \"Toronto's best cupcakes?\".  I sincerely hope not.  I may have to find some other comfort food...or actually embark on the promised diet.  
They're not bad-they're perfectly edible but they're by no means cupcakes I would travel for.
The first day I went in I had a lovely lady serving me.  It was fun!  They had samples of (delicious) brownies and I bought a trio of mini cupcakes which she put in a tray for me.  The carrot cake one was really good-spicy bun, fresh tasting cream cheese frosting.  The chocolate one was dense and heavy but tasty.  A mini one would be enough.  Vanilla tasted a bit strange.
The following week I had a guy.  I wondered at the red velvet cupcake they have-I'm used to it being a dark red/brown bun with a white frosting ...like this-http://www.flickr.com/photos/jamieanne/2722561177/.  He looked at me like I was demented when I tried to explain so I just trailed off and mumbled something about \"bit obsessed...\".  Bought vanilla and chocolate again.  He helpfully placed them in a napkin so that the frosting got smashed into it.  Vanilla definitely not nice.  Too much extract in the frosting (which was hard) and a rock hard bun.  Probably partly because it came from the fridge.  On second tasting, the chocolate one is only OK.  Frosting pretty much exactly like the Betty Crocker one.  
At $1.50 per mini they shouldn't be just acceptable....they should be practically gourmet and consistently good.   I'm not overwhelmed.  This is probably a good thing considering the proximity to my condo and my too tight clothing!"}
{"text":"I'm sure the fact that I bake a LOT affected my review of this place, but....meh. I've baked better cupcakes at home. I was looking for good cupcakes in Toronto and this place was on a couple of lists so me and a friend went and checked it out. It was pretty mediocre. I don't like that the cupcakes were kept in a fridge (all the other bakeries I've been to as well as the ones I've made at home were kept at room temp) and the cakes tasted pretty oily. A little disappointed, not sure if I'll give it a second chance."}
{"text":"I discovered Miss Cora's on a weekend stroll through Kensington, on a search for food. I rarely make my way down Kensington Ave., but I am happy I took the (three minute) detour to explore! 

They had great options for me as well as my vegetarian friend - we both had pizzas and a mini cupcake ($4!!!!!!!!!). My pizza was a bacon, cherry tomato and mozzarella, while hers was a variety of roasted veggies. I had the red velvet cupcake (maybe not the best I've ever had), and she had an amazing chocolate ganache.

I also noticed that they had a variety of lemonades, including regular, grapefruit, and mint (I wanted to try, but I only brought $5!), they also have sandwiches ($6), and a variety of other treats (cookies, squares, etc.)

I will definitely be back to Miss Cora's for the pizza and a cupcake deal, as well as the lemonade! I couldn't be happier I (finally) discovered this place!"}
{"text":"We stopped by Miss Cora's Kitchen during a rather epic, sprawling Cupcake Crawl last weekend and Cora herself delighted us with a tray of mixed mini cupcakes for us to sample. The Red Velvet minis were perfect - tangy, zesty cream cheese icing and red-tinged cake bottoms. The perfect size for snacking - I think you could get away with eating two! $1.50 per mini."}
{"text":"On my epic official tasting tour of Kensington, Cora's is were I go for a sweet ending. Everything there is great, but I am specifically writing this with the seven layer bar in mind. In fact, I have no idea how there isn't a single Yelp review that mentions this slice of heaven.

The seven layer bar (7LB) is made up of chocolate, coconut, oats, some sort of nut, and three other things that are almost unbearably delicious. The slice is $3 a pop, but it is a fairly large square and it is worth every penny and calorie. It's always available because it is their best item and boy does Cora know that. Cora (or the woman I presume is Cora) always lights up when I ask for a 7LB and readily admits that it is pretty much the best thing ever.

Cora's always puts out a table on the weekends in the summer and has its regular pastries and lemonades. The stuff is fairly pricey but I think everything that isn't a cupcake is amazing. The cupcakes are overpriced and aren't the most competitive, but fear not, because you can get a 7LB.

They have savory things, too, but I've never had anything. Stay sweet, Cora!"}
