{"text":"Every now and then on a Friday we like to get take-out in the office. We'd been ordering from the same old dreggy Thai place on King for years, and when they eventually stopped delivering their greasy lunch combo's to us, we decided to try something new.

Pepper Ring Asian Cuisine was not only brilliantly priced, it was incredibly quick.. The food was hot and delicious and the helpings were generous considering the $9 price tag.

I had the wonton soup, which was hearty and the General Tao's chicken, both of good quality.

We have found our new take-out place and we shall not be looking back."}
{"text":"This place has an interesting mix of Thai, Vietnamese and Chinese dishes, that are decently prepared. I have no idea why this place isn't busier (though it does get a lot of take out orders). I think it's because they haven't figured out how to market themselves. The calamari and spring rolls are fantastic, the pineapple rice is fun (served in half a pineapple), the mango salad had a great dressing, and the price points are low for Liberty Village. Staff are friendly and the ambiance is modern but comfortable. Only thing I wish they'd add is fruit and coconut shakes--they have a blender but perhaps they don't sense a demand for them. If you're in Liberty give them a shot (and tell them you wish they made coconut shakes, please!). I'll be heartbroken if they go out of business."}
