{"text":"Otakumen/pat and Waldo's was almost deserted at 12:32 on a Wednesday, a warning sign I ignored to my regret. Ordered gyoza to go.  Priced low $5.  Box contains 5 tiny remarkably greasy gyoza.  Ate one and just can't face rest.  Much much too greasy."}
{"text":"Gave it a shot despite reviews.  Being a Ramen aficionado, I set my expectations to low, but late at night the options were limited.  I ordered the spicy Ramen and despite having a high tolerance, it was far too spicy for my taste. It is mediocre Ramen at best even if it hadn't been too spicy.   The service was excellent and they offered free lemonade."}
{"text":"Place was clean. The restroom is confusing to locate. Tonkotsu ramen was bland. Prices were good. $6 -$7. Again ramen was bland."}
{"text":"I go there almost daily as I work across the street.   They got off to a rough start but seem to have it together now.   The Ramen is very tasty and hearty and a good bargain at 6.50 to 7.50. A friend had the fried rice and said it was delicious. I have also eaten from the Italian side... Very good food but wished the entree came with a small salad!"}
{"text":"Really hate to say this because I want to like this ramen shop but I am having a hard time finding anything good about this shop.   1 - served in a metal bowl that made the already luke warm ramen cold within ten minutes  2 - missing ingredients like mushrooms  3 - small serving  4 - broth had zero flavor tasted like pork broth 5 - no ramen spoon just a regular small plastic spoon  6 - pork was nothing but fat  7 - not sure what was up with the noodles but something was odd about them   Overall I really want to like this place and will give it another chance."}
{"text":"This ramen is terrible. I got the shio tonkotsu, which costs $7.50. Definitely not worth the price, as it is a very small portion. In addition the broth is more of a sludge, super oily and thick with little to no pork flavor. There are mushrooms in the bowl too, but they appear to be deep fried and also have a very oily taste. I took four bites and couldn't continue because I started feeling queasy from all of the grease. Not recommended!!"}
{"text":"Tried the shoyu ramen. It was perfectly balanced and arrived relatively fast. I love that they have vegan options too. I will definitely be back to try the other concept and bring friends to sample more of the menu. All in all, pretty excited for this convenient option for DTPHX."}
{"text":"Ramen snob here. I've had ramen in many different restaurants in San Diego, San Francisco, Manhattan and Las Vegas, and 4 here in PHX. Went in on opening day, 1 hr wait. Ramen noodles where chewy and tasted more like pasta. Tonkotsu Broth had good flavor with the added red onion, but it was in no way actual tonkotsu broth. The pork was more fat than pork. They were out of gyoza. Fried rice was amazing. Only 1 person in our party of 4 finished their bowl, and the other 3, we left hungry and went to Lux for coffee and pastries to fill up. Unless things change to something closer to Republic Ramen, which is no where near the top on my best ramen list, I wont go back. I will give them 1 more chance down the road."}
{"text":"This is a terrible awful pathetic excuse for a Japanese restaurant.  The ramen broth would have no flavor save for the greasy taste in your mouth. Unbelievable.  I took 4 bites - yuck.  The gyoza were worse.  Barely choked one down / pure spit out quality.  Now I'm hungry and it's only 4pm.  Stay away!  This place is a poster child for why you should Yelp before you bite."}
{"text":"Always enjoy the chahan fried rice when I eat lunch here. Sometimes I add the gyoza. Nice, friendly staff."}
{"text":"I'll give the Italian a go. But the tonkatsu didn't impress me. No real depth to the broth. And not the myriad toppings like most ramen spots. Which is too bad because I was so excited to have a ramen spot.  Food repeated in me later, too."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Roman! I had the chicken and made it a little spicy... Unbelievable and it's a good price. Hidden treasure for sure."}
{"text":"This place is awful.  We left after the second bite.  Service - One menu stuck on the window.  Very unappealing presentation.  The order taker was clueless about the available items, and completely unenthusiastic.  Ramen - The broth was oily, the Chinese egg noodles were undercooked, the pork belly was a soggy fatty mess.  Overall, we could only stomach two bites.  Miso Salad - A bunch of romaine with no dressing and three orange slices.    Gyoza - We took one bite and stopped eating it because the meat was not cooked through.    Karaage Chicken - Essentially a chicken nugget cut into smaller pieces.  No soy, garlic or ginger marinade at all.    We were so hopeful about Otakumen.  Too bad it was so terrible."}
{"text":"Was there for grand opening today, waited in line for a half hour and waited another hour for food. The place was very busy, which is understandable for a first day. That would usually be no problem, but staff failed to let many customers know that the kitchen was behind on orders by 60-90 min. When my hubby and I finally got our food after that hellish wait, we were disappointed by the bland and underwhelming broth and noodles. We each ordered different dishes but were equally disappointed. I'm no food snob at all, but that food was awful. Neither of us could even finish it. I left hungry and with a bad taste in my mouth. They had a promo where food was half off in exchange for a donation of instant packaged ramen. Sad to say that I would have gladly traded our food for the cheap 18 cent noodles that I donated.  Would have rated 1 star but staff was kind enough to give us an extra order of mediocre pot stickers while we waited. Nice ambiance and appealing menu, if only their food (the actual important part) had lived up to the hype."}
{"text":"Delish! The place is upscale for a fast casual restaurant. The Ramen was done perfectly.  Excellent value and a perfect downtown quick bite."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, one star is being too generous!   Absolutely the nastiest noodles I have ever had!  I ordered the Shio Tonkatsu... The noodles and broth were so oily is was disgusting!  As I sit here at write this review, my stomach is turning and I'm nauseous... when asked how the food was by the cashier, I told her that my food was inedible due to the grease and she apologized but didn't ask If we wanted to speak to the manager... poor customer service... I will not be returning to this food establishment... I'll be surprised if it can stay open another 6 months..."}
{"text":"Don't go! Save your money! Save your calories!  Came here on a weekday around 1:30pm only because Harumi was closed for the afternoon because of some remodeling. Well after having paid the meter, my sister and I were inclined to stay and go somewhere else. This place is next door, and we thought why not.   First off it was dead...which is never a great sign. I didn't look at the reviews before ordering, but I wish I had. I got the #1 tonkotsu and my sister got the shio torigara. Both were not good - just not good. I haven't had such a strong reaction to something this unpleasant in recent memory. Though the presentation was nice, the flavor was off. The broth was smokey-flavored and sort of runny - both threw me off. The noodles were standard. The 4-5 slices of pork were thin but had some flavor. They added red onions, which I don't really care for, and mushroom slices, which tasted like dirt. I loveee mushrooms, but I was not a fan of these. Also, where is the easy boiled egg! Ugh so much was off with the bowl. I couldn't even take more than a few bite. Same with my sister....though she did say the chicken pieces were fine.   We left with the bowls nearly untouched and went somewhere else to get food..."}
{"text":"Ok, so here we go. This place has been getting hammered and we need more people taking the risk of a new business in downtown Phoenix so we went to dinner here tonight.   Once upon a time at my first job the bosses asked me to put together a prospectus for a client. They said I could just cut copy and paste bits of existing ones together, but I wanted to show them how industrious I was. So I did one from scratch, they didn't like it and told me \"all you have to do is piece the good parts together of the ones that already exist.\"  I feel like this is the lesson for this restaurant, you can tell the work, the love the time these guys are putting in, but they are committing the #1 error of marketing classes. You can't be all things to everyone.  Quality ingredients and a lot of heart but stretched in too many directions.  We got the Cesar salad, bolognese pasta, ramen and gyoza.   Noodles seem to be their strength, but Italian noodles only. The ramen noodles were crimped spaghetti. You can easily go and get premade noodles for the ramen that would significantly improve your customer experience. Look at all the reviews the haters are zeroing in only on the ramen. My pasta bolognese was good. The Cesar salad dressing was a bit heavy in the anchovies. And the gyoza man, I can get better gyoza at trader joes. Just reheat frozen ones. The meat is too dry in your, then that dry meat throws off your taste buds. These are totally easy fixes.  If you guys simplify you will be great and also probably save money because you will need less staff.  You're reinventing the wheel enough with Italian/Ramen. If you don't make it easier on yourselves you will end up pulling out your hair and have Gordon Ramsey to answer to."}
{"text":"This place is wonderful! I'm eating some peppers I've never heard of that are incredibly delicious along with the best fried rice I've ever had!!! Wonderful service as well!!!!"}
{"text":"I hate to say it, but this place is a hot, noodly mess. I went on opening day, but try not to judge places until they've been open at least a week. So a week later... possibly even worse. Not a good trend.  The cashier said she started that morning and did not know the menu.  The guys on the line seemed really disorganized, and two of them were grabbing ingredients for the ramen with their BARE HANDS. I asked the woman calling orders about it, and she reminded them to put on gloves. Is that something you should really need to remind your cooks? Ugh!  It took 45 minutes to get our noodles, and they were bland and completely unexciting. On the way out we saw the manager (owner?) laughing and chatting with some people, while his kitchen was losing its mind and customers were getting peeved at the wait. He needs to shift his focus a bit or he'll have plenty of time to stand around and chat when his restaurant closes down.   No plans to come back. If I get a hankering for noodles there is some thai and pho not too far away."}
{"text":"I was super excited about this place, Umami closed recently and I was struggling to find good ramen.  We arrived two hours after they opened, and half the menu was not available. The staff didn't know the menu, so it was super hard to order.  My order was messed up in the end, but honestly none of that matters to me if the food itself taste good.  Sadly it did not, the broth was incredibly bland and my boyfriend said the meat was non existent.   I realize they are new, so almost all little things can be forgiven. But when the food isn't good in beginning, I'm not sure how that will change."}
{"text":"As a vegan, I expect to not be able to eat many places, which is why I was so excited that Otakumen had a vegan option. On their grand opening day (~roughly 45 minutes wait time) I had asked before hand if the vegan option would be available in conjunction with the promotion they were having. I believe \"Absolutely! Just let them know at the register!\" were the exact words I got. Very disappointing to wait in line for nearly an hour to find out that it would be \"not possible\" to make the vegan option. I noticed quite a few others who were told this at the beginning of the line and left more than upset."}
{"text":"Wow, this place is so underrated.  I guess some people just aren't smart enough to order from this place.  Delicious Spicy Miso Ramen.  Excellent food and experience!  The green tea tiramisu was okay, but the Spicy Miso Ramen was excellent!"}
{"text":"I was one of the lucky people who got to try Otakumen's ramen the day before the grand opening. The broth was so, so delicious and the meat on top of the bowl was really tender and flavorful! That said, I went back on opening day and it definitely wasn't the same ramen I had the day before. I think a lot of that had to do with it being opening day. The kitchen was constantly busy with a line that went out the door! I would definitely come back when it's less busy. I'll be chasing that first-time flavor, so fingers crossed!"}
{"text":"So we came here on grand opening day at around 6:30 pm. We parked on Monroe with metered parking. We went in line and someone greeted us and gave us a menu, which I thought was cool. It was crowded and we ended up waiting for an hour to order our food. It was expected because it was grand opening day. Anyway, they did this thing (for grand opening day) where if you bring a package of top ramen, you get selected ramen for 50% off. When we got to the cash register, the person took our order and she had to calculate everything in her head and tell us the price, which I thought was weird. And we didn't even get an itemized receipt. We had the option of a texted or e-mailed receipt but even then, it just told us the price we paid, nothing itemized. We ordered the Shio Tonkotsu and Shoyu ramen and the Chahan (japanese-style fried rice) and oolang tea (in a can). Everything came to be $14, which wasn't bad because the ramen was 50% off. We waited 20-30 minutes for the food (expected because it was grand opening day) but when we got it, the ramen was so bland....and the noodles tasted...squishy/soggy?? The actual broth was really bland. The only thing I thought was good was the japanese-style fried rice. That fried rice was really good! But if it's a ramen place, shouldn't the ramen be better than the fried rice.....? Anyway, I don't think I would come back here. Maybe for the fried rice....but probably not.   BY THE WAY, the bathrooms, if you go under where it says the bathroom sign, you will see a door in front of you that says \"exit\" on top and a door to your left. Go to the door in front of you even though it says \"exit\" (it will lead you to the bathroom). I made the mistake of opening the door to my left, which was the kitchen. I asked for the bathroom and they said straight down the hall....oops. But why don't they have signs to LEAD me to the bathroom??? Come on now..."}
{"text":"Amazing.  Friendly service in a unique downtown environment.  Great prices and products."}
{"text":"Seriously, the best spicy ramen I've ever had! I really enjoyed the setting with 2 restaurants, including an Italian joint in the same location. This will be the perfect place to return with my coworkers with whom would much prefer pasta.  The ramen had the perfect heat and contained all ingredients I was familiar with and felt good eating. Often when getting ramen there are a couple of items I can't quite recognize and I eat around. The egg in the ramen was perfectly cooked and the broth was so tasty. Can't wait to return for another helping!"}
{"text":"First time at Otakumen. Stooped in at 1:30 for lunch on a Saturday and no one was in there. Hmm.   My son-in-law and I both ordered from the Japanese side. I got the Miso Togarashi but they were out of the Cucumber Tsukemono app. My son-in-law got Gyoza and Tonkotsu.   The Gyoza arrived in six mins. 5 for $5. I like them pan fried, which they were. I wouldn't change anything.  The Togarashi was okay. More spice than flavor. The fillings were plentiful, except the protein of course. My son-in-law said he enjoyed the Tonkotsu.   Nothing really stuck out as fantastic, other than the cool concept of Japanese and Italian in the same restaurant."}
{"text":"Went in this afternoon during their slow time. Staff was friendly and courteous, but their ramen was not to par. Their broth (I got the shio tonkotsu, the one I originally wanted was unavailable) was very, very salty. Shio (?) means salt in Japanese, but normal shio ramen should not be this salty. I couldn't finish it because of this--that's a first for me when it comes to ramen. The only good thing in their ramen is their chashu, which was actually very good! Their gyoza tasted very strange though, I'm not sure why. The inside of this restaurant was beautiful and the people were kind, so I wish I could say better."}
{"text":"I had Miso Togarashi. It was very very good! Maybe 5% too spicy but very good. My friend asked for less spicy and she got it.  Soup had a bit of fat and pork and everything u need. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"After reading all the bad reviews, I was very hesitant to visit, however my friend was really craving a ramen bowl so we decided to give it a try. Surprisingly, the menu offered both Japanese cuisine and Italian dishes, so I decided to get ragu on the Italian menu. My friend ordered the tonkatsu ramen and said \"it was okay\", and a bit too oily. She stated that the ramen wasn't too bad to the point that it deserved two stars (as awarded by many yelpers), but it was definitely not a home-run compared to other ramen places. My ragu was mediocre as well, as the noodles were very dry and clumped together. I would probably not visit this place again if I had other options, however if you happen to be in downtown Phoenix, craving a ramen bowl, I would go ahead and fulfill my craving although it might not be 100% satisfying."}
{"text":"Highly disappointed given the initial hype of a ramen spot finally opening downtown. I was so confused by what I was eating! I ordered the tonkatsu ramen and the broth was not rich and creamy like pork broth should be; instead it was like water and soy sauce. The noodles were thin and nothing remarkable. The only tasty thing was the three thinly sliced pork belly. But, a fantastic bowl of ramen needs a good broth to compliment the pork belly! The way the ramen was served was odd, too. Metal bowls with light cheaply chop sticks and a regular plastic (albeit Eco-friendly) in spoon. The shallow, non-soup spoon made it awkward to sip the the lack luster broth from the deep bowl. I don't know if the concept was to be a different interpretation of ramen, but it definitely was not what I was expecting. Seems like they focused on the modern look of the restaurant decor rather than the actual  menu. I hate to give a bad review to a local business trying to add to the downtown Phoenix community, but this just wasn't worth the time and money...in my opinion."}
{"text":"Sadly, the Ramen is so oily that it is hard to eat. I got through half the bowl before stopping but my girlfriend only took 2 bites before she was done. Noodles are a bit soggy. The portions are small for $7.50. The place is kind of like a food court. Will probably never come again unless they redo their recipe."}
{"text":"Definitely not worth driving to downtown phoenix and looking for parking to try this place. Came on grand opening day and wasn't even able to try anything because the owner was outside already telling people that they had ran out of food. Then I came back with my husband and sister another day to give it a try. Should have believed all of the bad reviews... the worst ramen that I've ever had. Even Costco's frozen ramen is better than the ramen we had here."}
{"text":"After writing over 300 reviews, finally came the time to write 2 star review. I always wondered if I would ever write two star reviews... They opened just about a month ago, despite of not so good reviews, my colleague wanted to try. He finally convinced me as he offered to drive and pay for my lunch if negative reviews are in fact correct.   First thing I noticed was Japanese translation for pick up window. When I saw that Japanese characters, I almost lost an appetite. They probably used online translation and picked the first one on the list.  Character they used was to be used for picking something from floor/ground.  I think combination of toughness and elasticity is the essential chewing texture of a tasty ramen. First bite of this noodle, it didn't have the texture I was hoping. It was too soft, I wondered why they boiled the noodle so long...  Soup should be hot, granted they might not be able to serve really hot soup in the United States due to liability issue, but their soup was very lukewarm. Soup would have been better if they could have served a tad hotter.  Gyoza - i was convinced they just heated up the frozen package. To make it worse, they picked gyoza with thick wrapper.  Japanese style gyoza, in my humble opinion, should be thinner than what they served.  Ramen was only $7.50  i would be happy to pay more for a good one but what they served here, it was priced right... I thought...  Ramen was not what I call ramen.... Everyone's taste buds are different. Some may like this soft noodles and lukewarm soup. I personally didn't like it but it doesn't mean everyone else agrees.. Just saying.."}
{"text":"Ramen expert here... aka probably more in depth about ramen than you want to know. I came here during grand opening and waited an hour for food. I'm not going knock them on service since it was a special occasion. But I will grade them based on pure flavor, noodles, aesthetics and price!  FLAVOR: I ordered the Tonkatsu Ramen #1. For tonkatsu, the best is when the broth is boiled for hours and hours creating a deep complex consistency and flavor. This broth was quite watery, but it had flavor. I think the butter they added in there helped along with the fatty pork strips that were in the bowl. So it gets a pass for at least meeting the flavor criteria. It wasn't bland. It met the minimum.  NOODLES: There's different kinds of ramen noodles. I'm glad it doesn't have the 7 cent store bought package type of noodles in my bowl. For this particular bowl, they used thin noodles. One of my other Yelpers confused it for Angel Hair Pasta. I thought it was real ramen noodles although it may have been Chinese egg noodles. But I decided that it was actually ramen noodles.  AESTHETICS: This part could really be improved. Why? Because my meal came in a cheap plastic bowl with a cheap plastic spoon with the cheapest lightest and thinnest chopsticks. It gave me the feel of fast food in a food court feel.  PRICE: Although we got half price for Grand Opening day special, the amount doesn't seem worth the price. For that price, you can get a bowl of pho that is twice as big. Heck, you can get ramen at other places that are twice as big for that price. So I am saying that the serving size is small. Some people liked it because they could finally finish a bowl of ramen for once, but I think you just overpaid for mediocre ramen.  SUMMARY: If I were to compare it to ramen I had in Japan or even California, this place can't even compete. But since we are in AZ with basically 3 to 4 other places that serve ramen, then Otakumen suffices if you are in the area. I'm actually glad it's here because downtown Phoenix doesn't have a ramen place. The other places are in Tempe, Scottsdale, etc. And Otakumen serves decent ramen.   So come try this place out. I see it improving over time. :)"}
{"text":"My sister was the first to bring this to my attention, as an avid ramen lover, when she told me that a new ramen place was opening I was instantly elated. There was a lot of hype around the first day of opening since they had offered that if you brought in a package of instant ramen for them to donate, you'd get 50% off your order. We obliged, made arrangements to go grand opening day all the way from Queen Creek to downtown Phx (50min drive). When we arrived, the place wasn't too busy but the owner/chef notified there was about an hour wait for ramen, then he said they were pretty much out of stock of ingredients. We left.  Last night, we finally returned to try the damn ramen, mind you it's saturday at 8pm the night before Valentine's day, thought it'd be busy but it was crickets in there. We ordered Shio Tonkotsu (the pork broth). The only conclusion I can come to is that it was disappointing and left me unsatisfied and desiring to leave to seek out a different ramen joint ASAP. The flavor of the broth was boring, it should really be saltier. On top of that the broth was lukewarm. The only redeeming quality they had in this awful ramen was the meat, it was wonderfully flavored and a great cook... just give me a bowl of that. My conclusion is two fold, I'm bummed that this ramen was so lacking, but grateful that it wasn't insanely good cause that would mean I would have to make a 50min drive all the time for AWESOME ramen... But I don't. First and last time customer."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place.  I ordered the pork broth ramen. The broth and noodles were pretty flavorless. The vegetables were ok, but didn't feel right. The meat inside the broth was actually pretty good, but that's the only thing that stood out. I had to add hot sauce and soy sauce to everything in order to get any type of flavor.   The service and location are fine, but nothing special there either. The price is not bad-$7.50 for the bowl. I was going to get a can of UCC green tea to go with my meal but it was $3.50... $3.50! Ridiculous. Pretty sure I've seen those for $1 elsewhere.   I'm not certain this place is even worth another try. Everything was just meh and they would have to improve greatly for me to want to go back."}
{"text":"Best ramen in Phoenix by a long stretch!! It even beats a couple of decent L.A. Ramen bars.  Get the shoyu and ask for it spicy. You can thank me later. The miso togarashi is pretty good too.  The gyoza are nothing special.  Big criticisms are the metal bowls and the small plastic spoons. They say they're waiting on new spoons and bowls. I'm really hoping that happens soon."}
{"text":"I don't even understand how this place has an 3.5 star rating, this place  by far is the worst ramen I've had.  I've never thought package ramen could taste better then this so called authentic ramen.   Ramen noodle hard  Tonkotsu broth terrible I was lost of what kind of broth this was even suppose to be.   Portion size very small Togo bowl"}
{"text":"I didn't go opening night but I did go today and let me say. For a ramen shop to be in az, it's pretty good. I recommend the miso tonkotsu and make it spicy. I really loved the noodles that it came with. :). It was delicious. The egg was perfection and I've been to a lot of ramen shops. Their customer service was great and the cashier was quite helpful."}
{"text":"They didn't have ingredients on their second day. Spent 30 minutes trying to find the place. They have no signs or anything and then they didn't have any food."}
{"text":"When we heard there was a new ramen place opening downtown we were super excited and came for their opening day. Our group got pretty much all the different types of ramen on the menu as well as karage and fried rice appetizers. I ordered the shio tonkatsu ramen. The broth was super disappointing. Not only was it bland it was also very watery. I'd actually rather eat instant ramen noodles than that again. The noodles were also disappointing and honestly tasted like instant ramen noodles. The karaage appetizer was my least favorite part. They were large tough chunks of chicken that were soggy on the outside. The fried rice was everyones favorite part of the meal, not because it was good but because honestly everything else was pretty subpar. On the bright side we got everything half off so for the price it was okay but I would definitely never come back here otherwise. Maybe they're still sorting out their kinks since they just opened but considering the chef is from LA (home of amazing ramen) I expected much better. I'd recommend Dozo Izakaya in Tempe for some decent ramen."}
{"text":"Hey, don't believe what yelpers say. I'm Japanese and I think this ramen is good!  If you want to eat real ramen with the urban twist, come here."}
{"text":"We went here on opening night!! YES we did!! Waited 1 1/2 hours just to order food which I understand because it's their first day so we were willing to wait.   I really hoped that it would be worth it. We got 3 types of ramen since we were getting half off on the 2 for the opening special and a fried rice. They used plastic bowls and tiny plastic spoons... Terrible idea when serving soup... Unless they only did it for the grand opening. The noodles were all bland. We weren't able to finish any of it! And that's with me starving myself in the line. I had to load my ramen with almost the whole container of the flavoring. Best part of the meal was the gluten free noodles that I substitute one of the ramen for and the fried rice. Along with the other Yelpers, I was also kinda drooling over the package of ramen I exchanged. :)   I hope the lack of flavor is just because they're still trying to sort things out. So I might give this place another try later down the road. Service is nice and friendly though!"}
{"text":"I've tried really really hard to like this place. Tried the pasta, ramen and chahan. So far, the only dish worth buying again was the chahan (fried rice). Today, I came in to for 3 orders and rice is completely under cooked. I mean, crunch in between my teeth hard. The staff is always very friendly but good service can only take you so far. Being downtown, most customers are in on their lunch break. It's inconvenience of time and money when I need to find something else to eat. Hope management will take all of these review seriously and make the changes it needs to succeed."}
{"text":"The spicy ramen had a very, very Bland broth, small portion and chicken Karrage appetizer was rubbery. My friend had the chicken ramen, also very bland. My other friend tried the Alfredo which was super dry and meatballs in marinara appetizer had an odd taste to the marinara sauce. It was hard to pinpoint what was wrong with the sauce, but it was not very appetizing. A young Asian girl with glasses came and asked how was the food and my friend told her input about his ramen and as I was trying to tell her about the rest of the food she just disregarded me and walked away. The Decore was nice though! Lol"}
{"text":"Just went for lunch. I ordered the MISO TOGARASHI ramen (\"Our homemade spicy miso, Tokyo style noodle drenched in a 50/50 pork chicken broth & topped with 2 slices of slow cooked pork belly chashu and spicy Asian slaw...topped with half an egg and garlic chips\")  and the TOFU SALAD. I liked both quite a bit. The tofu salad was good, but small. I probably won't order it again. The ramen, on the other hand, is going to be a staple. The pork was amazing, so was the egg. I slurped up everything! I went at 11:30. No wait. Walked in and ordered. Food came out fast. I spent $14, but I ordered the salad. I'm looking forward to more satisfying yummy lunches from this place that will be under $10!"}
{"text":"Was going to get a late night bite to eat, said they were open online and boom....there was a closed sign...what the heck."}
{"text":"I will return to Otakumen once the rush has died down and the team has found their groove. With a few minor modifications this place will be incredible and the line will always be long. All ramen loving Phoenicians should want desperately for this place to succeed and visit and write diplomatic reviews accordingly.    Opening day: Arrived at 5:30pm greeted by a jovial host (unsure if host was directing first day traffic, or is a mainstay) and the dining area was almost empty. We thought \"We beat the rush!\". No such luck. They were out of ramen. Good news: just a 15 minute wait. So we happily went to the cashier and were first in line to Order. Decent variety of Japanese drinks available at moderate markup ($3 each). The Mango cream soda was incredible. The cashier was very sweet and gracious but self deprecating, repeating \"i can't do math\". She really couldn't. I added up our bill for her twice and she still undercharged us.   Sides:  We ordered the karaage (fried chicken pieces): favorite item on the menu. Just enough to crunch, and meat was tender and juicy. Someone was heavy handed with the  cabbage garnish. It took up most of the plate/got in the way.   chahan (fried rice): excellent flavor, rice was perfectly fried with the right balance of smokiness from wok and pork fat.   ginger dressed salad: dressing was flavorful but lacking - not a good dressing to lettuce ratio. The orange slices were a nice touch but salad should have been tossed and was lacking texture. Maybe fried rice noodles or something more inventive.band easy on the lettuce!   There's definitely an opportunity to up level this salad with little effort. I envision myself ordering a salad and a side of tonkatsu in the future if they modify the salad.   They were out of gyoza and tofu salad.  Ramen:  Tonkatsu (pork): pork belly was amaaaaaaaaaazing. Well prepared, chef! Excellent flavor. Tender with melt in your mouth nuggets of fat. Well prepared. I've read other reviews naysaying the pork and I heartily disagree. However, the texture may be off putting to an unknowing palate. It is not supposed to be rubbery, dry, or crispy.  The broth was mild with subtle flavor. I expected a more rich broth to accompany the pork, I'd rate it mediocre. I mentioned we were the first in line to order once ramen was ready. Our ramen was lukewarm when it arrived. How is this possible? Need a better insulated serving bowl, or possible even ceramic if all goes well. I hope it does.   They were out of all desserts.  Chopsticks, Plastic utensils, plastic cups (for fountain) plastic bowls, paper serving plates."}
{"text":"I'm passing through Phoenix on business and was craving some noodles. I found this place on Yelp and wanted to give them a try. Plus they are within walking distance of my hotel. On a Saturday afternoon I had no wait and the customer service was great. There was a very polite cashier who answered my questions and actually brought the food to my table.   I had the Miso Togarashi Ramen and a side order of Karaage. The noodles were perfect and I thought the broth was satisfying. It was a healthy serving and had plenty of toppings. The Karaage was also very good. It was freshly fried and crisp.   I'll definitely be coming back on my next trip! 5 Stars for good ramen in the USA!"}
{"text":"Tasted and smelled really gross. Walked out after two bites.  Four of us unanimously agreed that the food was unpleasant and inedible. We walked down the street to find another place to eat.   Nice staff though."}
{"text":"So glad that we finally have a ramen bar in Phoenix! It's been a long time coming for sure. First, my husband ordered the miso togarashi, and I liked his ramen better than my own! I ended up finishing his for him when he was done. It was so full of flavor! I ordered the shoyu and asked for it spicy, and it was good but could've used a little more flavor. I think I will ask for the crispy garlic chips from the togarashi added next time. The gyoza was good, but I wasn't sold on the sauce. My daughters ordered the tonkatsu, and they really liked theirs too. All in all, the ramen was better than any other ramen in Phoenix.   I have only 2 complaints. 1. No beer! I really like having a beer with my ramen, so I was disappointed when I found out they didn't have any. On the bright side, they are applying for a liquor license, so that will be nice when they get it. 2. The spoons were absolutely inadequate for ramen. I've heard that they are getting better spoons, so I hope that is true.   Definitely a must try!"}
{"text":"I decided to give this place a go after seeing it on my walk back from getting sushi at Harumi (one of the best places for sushi in Phoenix). I was excited because we finally had a ramen place within walking distance from work, but my experience was mixed. Firstly, the service and atmosphere was great for a downtown lunch. I liked the counter setup and the seating. Clean and comfortable. Prices are also reasonable. Now, the food is another thing.   First, the food was in one word - bland. The broth lacked character and was uninviting after the first taste. I would have liked to see more toppings and a more appropriate spoon option. On a bright note, I think this place has potential to be a downtown favorite if it can fix a couple things. Change up your broth, add more toppings, and find appropriate sized spoons then I'll give it another try."}
{"text":"I don't even want to give any stars for this place. I was so excited along with my friend to finally have a west side place for ramen in Phoenix. The anticipation was built up by the reviews covered by the new articles, we couldn't wait. We had just came back from California an had AMAZING ramen at Shin- Shen-Gumi. The place was fast and efficient and the atmosphere was great. It left me craving more ramen.  Anyways we went here on opening day a couple hours after they opened and arrived around 1:30 pm. There was a guy in a suit who said hello And didn't open the door for us, I'm assuming he was the investor of this horrible place. Walked in was completely confused as to where to go I wast greeted by a hostess because she wasn't there. I noticed the line and assumed we had to go up and order our food. So again with no direction of ordering and no one who looked like they worked there to ask questions of new incoming customers I asked the woman in front of me if this is the line to order. She said \" I'm assuming so, but I'm waiting to order ramen but the girl said we can't order right now because they don't know if they have ramen\" as soon as she finished that last word a woman came up to her and said \" did you say they aren't serving ramen anymore ?!\" And the woman said \" That's what that girl said\" well here I am still confused looking for guidance that woman turned out to be the hostess asking a customer if they ran out of ramen!! Even the hostess had no clue what was going on in the kitchen along with the cashier!! So walked up to the cashier asked her if they are serving ramen and she said \" no they ran out, and they have limited food with the Pat & Waldo side of the kitchen\"  seriously , it is opening day in the middle of the city of down town Phoenix during the busiest weekend down town with the college football championships and you promoted it for so long and built so much hype! Who runs out of ramen and broth , that is your main specialty!! My friend and I were so disappointed we walked out still confused and went to eat right next door at Thai Basil were I got to eat chicken curry ramen. As we sat there we kept seeing people walk in so upset that they closed the kitchen down and turned people away. So guess who got more business Thai Basil!  Now I have read that they shut down and put a flyer on the door because the supposedly brand new kitchen equipment had problems from opening day and they won't open up till the following week to come. So much for a million dollar investment. Oh and don't let me forget they serve you with plastic bowls! You can have star for the red themed decor even though you don't have a sign on the outside naming your restaurant  so people can find you"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place, I really did. I've been 3 times now since the grand opening and have left feeling unimpressed every time. At first I chalked it up to just being a newer restaurant still trying to figure out the kinks however it's been a few months and things don't seem to be improving."}
{"text":"Basis for my starred ratings (which skews heavily to the food): 1 star:  Never again. 2 stars:  Poor food, poor experience, extraordinary measures in order for me to come back. 3 stars:  Average, nothing really special, nothing particularly bad. 4 stars:  Very good, would definitely return. 5 stars:  A favorite, one of the best.  I do not exaggerate when I say this - this was the worst bowl of ramen in my life.    Before continuing, I will say this.  The manager that was on duty was very, very kind.  The counter staff were very nice too.  The space is pretty cool.  I would have loved decent ramen downtown, but this is not the place for decent ramen.  I've been to my fair share of ramen joints (if you want, check out my review of Tampopo Ramen in Tempe), and a comparison to the average ones wasn't even necessary.  The bowl that sat in front of me didn't even pass the sniff test.  I ordered the shio tonkotsu, Red flags already.  There is tonkotsu ramen, some tonkatsu-shoyu ramen, and a style of shio ramen called Hakodate ramen, but hadn't seen this combo before.  The broth lacked depth of flavor and was very, very thin.  But that wasn't the worst of it.  The noodles were abysmal.  Overcooked to the point of falling apart when I picked them up with my chopsticks, and floury to boot.  Forget the interesting addition of raw red onion on top, but the two most important elements of ramen here both fell very flat.    It would take something miraculous for me to give this place a second shot.  I applaud the owners for the effort in putting ramen downtown, but this half of the restaurant (the other occupied by Pat & Waldo's Itialian) isn't hacking it."}
{"text":"First impressions: The first few months of a restaurant opening will be pretty rough as expected so I didn't put forth too high expectations. I probably will write a review later when I come back but everything seemed a bit disorganized. The staff seem eager but not very knowledgeable about what they are serving. Otakumen operates next to a place that serves Italian food so there's a bit of an identity crisis here.   Food: I had the Tonkostu ramen and first off the noodles seemed like Chinese noodles. I remember someone from another post said the same thing and I didn't really want to believe it but yeah it was at least true when I got there. Ramen broth had some depth but it was lacking in flavor. It was rather plain and tasted more like the mushroom flavor. Unami flavor was very distant for being ramen. Overall I wasn't all that too impressed with it. I also had the pot stickers and let's just say that it was pretty sad. They were half cold and soggy. Not very crispy at all. It seemed like they were refrigerated and then microwaved.  Verdict: Most grand openings suffer from lots of issues and otakumen certainly has its wrinkles to iron out. I honestly hope this place improves because while it does have potential, it's a great location for downtown city eating."}
{"text":"Ramen that warms the soul! Freshness of ingredients is totally evident. Comfy environment, friendly staff -- awesome addition to the downtown dining scene. Also open till 3AM!? Perfect for those post-Valley Bar munchies."}
{"text":"For this to be called authentic ramen is kind of a misnomer. We didn't even eat there on opening day and I felt that everything about it was sub par. The broth was very salty and burnt, the pork tasted like bacon and the ramen like angel hair. There was too much oil in the broth so nothing was there to emulsify it. The cashier was also kind of unenthusiastic and slow.  One good thing is that it opens late and that it has really good dessert. They had this awesome tiramasu green tea thing that was very rich."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here to eat since Harumi Sushi was full.   It was a lovely surprise! You can tell it's a newer restaurant and they're working out small service kinks, but the food was amazing and the staff were very friendly.  My boyfriend and I love Ramen and were searching for a place in Phoenix since we just moved into the area, and this is it! He got the Miso Togarashi and I got the Torigara, both were extremely full of flavor. My boyfriend says this is the best spicy ramen he has ever had, we'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Went there for grand opening, ordered shoyu ramen. The one star is for the soggy ramen...seriously its soggy. Staffs are friendly tho"}
{"text":"It was my 1st time and my last. I'm a huge fan of Ramen (Cali style) So when I heard that the young chef was from California and also came from a family in the restaurant business I just assumed it would be great. I ordered the pork broth ramen, friend rice and Gyoza. None had any flavor not even salt just plain Bland. The Gyoza was missing a dipping sauce that might of made it better, sorry soy sauce doesn't cut it because it's too salty. The fried rice was super greasy, over cooked and had too much onions (and I love extra onions on everything) on top of zero flavor! The pork ramen, very sad... The broth was dark, flavor less, salt less, and fatty. I could see the fat clumping up in top of soup which meant it was to fatty and cold. The actual noodles were the only thing I enjoyed without the nasty broth. The texture was perfect on the noodles, I just wish I could put those noodles on a good broth! What a waste of noodles. The other part it's not a baby friendly restaurant. I took my 1yr old with me and they didn't any high chairs or booster seats. Do you know how hard it is to try to eat soup when your having to hold your child at a restaurant and also help her feed herself? Of course they do not have a baby changing station. I honestly think that they meant to make this place an after party place for drunk people. What restaurant opens its doors without high chairs or boosters? Not even one? Only drunk people would eat the food anyways."}
{"text":"First and foremost.. How confusing this place was to order food. We had to order food on the pats and Waldo side. Even though otakumen has their own separate line. Anyways. You order food, sit down and they bring it to you. So. I ordered the vegan ramen. It was so bland, I asked for hot sauce, it was eehhhhh. At least I try to make the broth better. Tofu is the MAIN thing in this bowl....but I never got tofu in my bowl.  *sad face*    I don't know about this place. I was super excited about vegan ramen... but it failed me."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I tried to come here the Sunday after they opened to find them closed with a note on the door saying they had run out of product. This was annoying because A) parking is a pain and costs money in this area and B) they didn't post that they would be closed online, which is the first thing I would do as a brand new business.   Regardless, I decided to come back to try the food a couple weeks later. The place was somewhat dead on a Saturday night. I tried the spicy ramen. Though it wasn't as greasy as reported by many reviewers (it was certainly edible), it was a bit greasy. It also had very little flavor. I asked for it to be extra spicy and it was hardly spicy. The meat was mediocre. The noodles were fine. I took half for leftovers, but only the noodles were edible a couple days later... The broth had become far too oily which affected the flavor. As far as ramen goes in the phx area, this was certainly near the bottom.   I also had the fried rice and that was pretty tasty. I would go back for the fried rice, but Not for the ramen.   Ps the service was fine and the Italian food in the same building was much better than the ramen."}
{"text":"Drove to downtown just to try this place a couple weeks after they opened. It was really hard to find, we passed by it and went around the block before someone told us. It was a weird set up like a food court with the ramen place and another italian place. I'm guessing its the same owners. Ramen was just okay, kinda bland. I found myself wanting to have pasta instead."}
{"text":"I tried this new establishment out recently and can say I enjoy: -the decor and restaurant layout -the relaxed and friendly service -how close this location is to my job and home (personal benefit)  Unfortunately I did not feel that the ramen was very high quality... the broth was so extremely oily I ended up with a stomach ache for most of the rest of the day. This is very unusual for me as I can typically consume darn near anything and feel great. The ramen was served pick-up style on a cafeteria tray in a little plastic black bowl, which was quite unimpressive as far as presentation/portion is concerned. The pork was mostly fat and the noodles were of a low quality. I had very high hopes for this place, but yikes. As this spot is fairly new I truly hope they can pull it together and produce something enjoyable. I'll be back in a month to give it another shot, fingers crossed for the best."}
{"text":"Today's Mission Impossible was a fail. The pork belly and the egg in my ramen bowls were super cold. The broth was very flavorful, but it was barely warm. There was no pork belly served with the Chahan as indicated on the menu, and the fried rice was bland. The gyoza was on point, but the karaage was ok. There was no flow to the delivery of food. The staff members seem to be walking around in total chaos to try to find the customers that the food belong to. No management staff come out to talk to us even after we complained about the food. Wow!! Really?? I'm all for supporting  small businesses, but man, this one makes it hard"}
{"text":"There has been a lot of talk about this place. Several yelpers came here and it was closed either because they were out of noodles or machine breakdown (or both). Some good and bad yelp reviews....finally I've decided to try it myself.   I didn't know that this place shares the same space with another restaurant. I got lost on 1st Street and finally found my way here. Basically, you order your food at the counter and you can sit wherever you want when the food is ready. I ordered it to go and it comes with a container that is sealed super tight. That is important especially when you need to bring it back few blocks back to work. I could see some nice bowls that they use if you choose to dine in. The kitchen is clean and the cashiers are super nice.   Since I didn't know what to order, I picked the first item on their menu, Shio Tonkotsu ($7.50 before tax). I'll be honest, their broth was a little blend and salty. But the meat is generous and the noodle is delicious. For drinks, I ordered their mango flavor soda ($3 per bottle) that is imported from Japan. A bit pricy but it was worth every penny. It has a strong mango flavor but not overly sweet. I'll definitely buy that again. My co-worker ordered a Miso Togayaski and it looks much more delicious than mine. The sauce is thicker and it even has an egg in it. She also told me their potsticker is very delicious.   I will come back here again to try the Miso Ramen noodle and a different flavor of soda. I am happy that they are in downtown and look forward to come back here again."}
