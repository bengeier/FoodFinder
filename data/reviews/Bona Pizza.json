{"text":"Service sucks! My bf went in to use the bathroom while i was in the car getting my son out before we went into the restaurant. I sat down and the owner was yelling to take my order. When my bf got out of the bathroom the owner yells out \"oh i didnt know u where with them.\" i guess he was mad that he used their bathroom. Their table cover is the paper you lay on in the doctors office! BUT the pizza was good. If the owner and his family wasnt so rude id tip them and give them 4 stars!!!!"}
{"text":"Unlike the big wig pizza joints in my area, Bona Pizza has always been a pleasurable experience for me plus I live right next to them that they walk it over to me and hand it over the wall. I mean the place is pretty simple with the traditional picnic table covers and old Pizza Hut style chairs but their food is pretty decent. They offer several combos meals plus have more than pizza and wings on their menu. Of course I have only had pizza, wings and fingers from this place. Love me the Rustica Pizza or even making my own. The ingredients are freshed and so is the dough, which wins me over Pizza Hut anytime."}
{"text":"This place has the worst customer service ever....they messed up our order n refused to fix it or refund our money and hung up on me!!!  Order from somewhere else! !!!"}
{"text":"This place was horrible! Ordered a two topping pizza and chicken strip combo. Chicken strip and fries tasted stale like they had been sitting around all day and reheated.  The pizza had the wrong toppings. When we called to address the issue, they said they would call us back. After waiting about 15 minutes and not receiving a call back, we had to call back again. They said they would send out a replacement pizza with the correct toppings as soon as their driver returned. Waited an hour, and nothing. Had to call again. At this point, it had been about 2 hours after original order had been placed!  When they answered,  they acted as if they didn't know what we were talking about and placed us on hold while we waited for the manager/owner to get off a \"business call\". When they finally got on the line, we requested our money back and the response was \"we can't give you your money back because we have your pizza already in the oven\". We were told we would have our pizza within 20 minutes. Over 30 minutes later, still no pizza!  It's places like this that give small businesses a horrible name!!! One of the worst customer service experiences I have ever encountered!!! You are better off going to a Little Cesaers or something equivalent... I'd rather eat THEIR crappy pizza and save my time and money then deal with this shitty service again!"}
{"text":"I placed an order with Bona Pizza at 8:30pm... an hour and half later I decided to call them and see what the issue with delivery might be. The manger was very rude to me and said that they were 'unable' to deliver my pizza. Instead of admitting that they were very busy and offering a discount on a future purchase or something to make up for the snafu, he actually hung up on me, a paying customer. I would have appreciated a call after the 30 minute delay or even after an hour delay, but I had to call Bona Pizza myself and see what the problem was. I have ordered from them 2 times in the past and the pizza is okay as far as taste, but never have I had an issue with rude customer service and lack of delivery.   I strongly recommend NOT ordering from them and they should not place flyers under hotel room doors if they 'cannot' deliver to these locations in a decent time frame. I am now ordering room service instead. By the way the hotel I am staying at is on the strip, near city center, so it is not far from Paradise, their location.   I am not the type to ever write a negative review unless my overall experience was terrible."}
{"text":"Simple and delicious. The crust was slightly sweet and the pizza was not greasy like the many I have encountered before. Only $16 for a large cheese pizza + an order of fries"}
{"text":"I wish I didn't have to give them a star. Horrible service horrible chicken fingers . Order was delivered to my room in 30 minutes. As soon as we opened the chicken strip box, we immediately called them and requested they send out new strips because they are clearly old! The guy that we talked to name was jake and instead of providing us with new chicken strips, he tried to convince us that they were fresh... REALLY! Then he said everything was shut down and he couldn't send out new strips . They didn't close for another 20 minutes . I am so upset . Jake told us that a manager was not there and to call back in the morning. I took a photo of those ugly ass old ass chicken strips and I am uploading it !"}
{"text":"If you get a flyer in your hotel, toss it immediately. The food took over an hour, not the 30-45 minutes quoted. The gyro meat was tough and overcooked, there were only a few sad pieces of said meat, and no utensils or napkins were sent along. The \"garlic knots\" were just small scraps of fried dough that were most likely left over from pizzas. And last but not least, the delivery driver could have delivered to the room, but called us down to the lobby instead at 10:45 at night. Terrible service and food."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Las Vegas.  And the owner is super-friendly and totally knows his food.  Go visit them and have the tastiest pizza ever in your life.  I have read reviews where people complain about the $1 surcharge on using a credit card - but that is totally fair and its just a courtesy for people who do not have cash.  After all, people - its only one dollar.  Today - that is practically nothing and its certainly worth the convenience."}
{"text":"Went to go here last night for dinner and they moved to 7750 S. Jones. Tried to find it, gave up after a few minutes, will try again though, this is one of my favorite places."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite pizza restaurant. I must say the pizza is better than Metro. The pizza is very d-e-l-i-c-i-o-u-s. It doesn't have that fake cheese taste. As I am writing this review, my boyfriend is considering picking up pizza from here. We eat here at least once or twice a week. My favorite the cheese pizza, great price. Highly recommend trying this place out. Spread the word about this restaurant.! You definately will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times before since it's so close to where I live, and it's definitely one of the better Italian restaurants in Vegas.    At first glance, this restaurant isn't too appealing.  The furniture looks like it was bought secondhand and from a bad dealer.  The walls are bare, and it's usually as empty as a ghost town when I go.  But, the food totally makes up for it as well as the service.  I ordered the Bona Pasta last time, and it came out burning hot!  It's almost like a baked ziti, and there was a gooey burning mess of cheese on top.  Underneath was the tomato-meat sauce goodness covered rigatoni.  It was delicious.  The portions are good for their price.  I had to take mine to go.  However, the pasta isn't that great as a leftover.  The meat-sauce took on a strange texture that I didn't find appealing.  The chef took our orders himself, and he even remembered what my father ordered last time (pork tenderloins).  Even more surprising was that the chef made the dish even though it wasn't on the menu and offered to make us whatever we wanted.  How cool is that?"}
{"text":"This isn't the best pizza I've ever had, but it's pretty damn good!  I've only tried the pizza here, but they've got several pasta dishes, calzones, sandwiches, etc.  I want to try some of the other menu items, but I just can't get away from that pizza!  You can get a large, 1 topping for $10!    Bona has the large (fold in-half style), thin crust, New York style pizza, which I usually don't prefer, but I make an exception with THIS pizza.  It's really simple pizza, but really awesome.  I think the sauce is what sets it apart from other places.  Also, the staff here is so sweet - I believe they're Italian (I'm not good with placing accents).  Beware of the $1 card charge though :("}
{"text":"Ok I admit the food is decent.  BUT there is way better places to go for service. The 2 stars are for the food.  I would've given them 3 stars but the food is decent but it is NEVER CONSISTENT.  Sometimes it's great and sometimes it's missing some kind of seasoning.    Twice in a row I have ordered from delivery from them and they got it WRONG!  And when I called, instead of apologizing, the owner gave me attitude!  TWICE he gave me attitude!  I mean come on.  Seriously, the owner is so macho and proud that he can not aplogize?  I've read other reviews on here and I was always like \"well the food is decent\" but after tonight no more.  There are plenty of other pizza places around here that I can order from.    So if you like mediocre service and sometimes decent food go here otherwise try somewhere else."}
{"text":"Pizza prepared the way it should be. Made from scratch with fresh ingredients."}
{"text":"Tried this place tonight and was so impressed I had to write a review ASAP!!  So the place itself is pretty bare bones...no decor...you might even think they just opened like an hour ago!  We ordered one large pepperoni pizza and an order of garlic bread with cheese. I ordered take out and live at least 5-6 minutes away. After reading some of the other reviews, I was concerned that by the time I got it home it would be soggy.  So we get home, crack that box open and whoa--the pizza looked great! It was bubbly and there were a few charred spots on the crust which, in my opinion is delish! And it was. This was a fantastic pizza. Not soggy at all. The sauce was pretty close to perfection. I hate heavy, chunky sauces and this was light and so flavorful. The crust was thin but had it had a bit of chewiness to it---definetley not paper thin. I had no complaints on this pizza. It was just perfect.   The bread was also a bit charred in the ends and the proportion was generous. No complaints.   My husband begged me to pick this up for Monday night football in a couple days and I agreed. In this area, our pizza choices are very limited; we are so happy to have found this place.   And the best part was the bill: $15 bucks including tip!! Holly mozzarella! I love this place. I just hope they're consistent.  Since my first review, we have eaten here 3 more times and the pizza is generally consistent. The first pizza we ordered was the best...the crust was crunchy and had those delish charred bubbles. The other pizzas we ordered since were a little flimsy and the crust a bit soggy but still very good.  I also ordered an antipasta salad and I'm guessing the dressing had anchovies in it cuz it tasted and smelled fishy---at least I'm hoping anchovies in the dressing was the cause for that! We didn't like it--It was ok for me but my husband was like NO! Get it outta here! The salad itself was soggy. Also ordered the chicken fingers--yum. Very good...although a little on the greasy side but I love this style of chicken fingers. Breaded style with your choice of mild, medium or hot sauce. And the ranch dipping sauce was bomb. Best ranch I've ever had. If you like the chicken fingers from Villa, you'll love these.  So, we still love this place and it has quickly become one of our favorites!"}
{"text":"Admittedly, I have not tried the pizza here so I can't comment on that.  I have been pleased with other things I have ordered including subs, calzones and salads.  I have used their delivery service multiple times and it has always been correct and reliable.  Their \"dining in\" amenities are severely limited.  There is no tableside service and you can forget getting something as exotic as a cup with ice for your drink.  There is also a bar in a separate room which seems to be closed during the day (when I was there), but may open in the evenings.  I am not sure if the two are the same business, but they are connected internally.  Perhaps they have cups and ice there!"}
{"text":"This place has the best pizza in all of Vegas. I get a large cheese easy sauce and it is perfect every time. This is the only place I order from."}
{"text":"I ordered from the flyer under the door. Looked really good. Read the reviews, decided to order anyway.  I asked to have pizza delivered to hotel room. They did not deliver to the hotel room and made me go from 28th floor to the lobby. I ordered from Eat24 and included the tip in the order, so I couldn't deduct any money for laziness. Additionally, I ordered a pizza with pepperoni and pineapple, and the pineapple only covered 45% of the pizza, what a waste. Another pizza was olives and pepperoni, olives were minimal.   I would try another delivery place first before trying to order from here."}
{"text":"Bona advertises itself as offering Italian-style pies, and what do I know? I've never been to Italy.   On our first visit, I had to say the pizza was quite decent. Maybe I finally found some local relief from the \"New York-style\" that dominates this town. (No slam on NY-style; it just isn't my thing.) Quality ingredients, the pizza not turning to mush or congealing before the meal was over, a fair price, and a nice guy at the counter made for a tentative thumbs up. Not amazing for my tastes, but one of the better pizzas in a pizza-bereft area.  (Okay, so they screwed up the second pizza entirely, which we only discovered upon getting home, but since I didn't say anything and give Bona Pizza a chance to make things right, I can't really complain here. Accidents happen.)  Second visit? More like Little Italy than Italia. Yikes. Now we had crust that goes vertical as soon as you grab the edge and is soggy by the end of the second slice. Same good service, same good price, same good ingredients, but not the same pizza at all.  Was it a fluke the first time? Did they change their style to suit the crowds? Was I just unlucky on the second visit?  These questions in my mind, there's another problem. As noted in another review, they have started slipping into gated apartment complexes and spamming the residents with their fliers. I'm of the school that just because everyone else does it, that doesn't make littering and (essentially) trespassing acceptable. If the people who worked at Bona Pizza weren't so nice and perhaps feeling desperate in this economy, I'd knock another star off this review. That said, this move has convinced me not to give them a third chance.  For those not bothered by live action junk mail, though, Bona Pizza is certainly worth a try. If it's your style of pizza, you'll probably be pleasantly surprised by the quality and the service."}
{"text":"If I could offer no stars I would in a heartbeat...  beware don't order... food sucks takes over an hour and a half to bring it to your room... Yes they actually delivered to my hotel room but like I said over an hour and a half pizza was cold very greasy and look like it was sitting out... looked like it was made by a kindergartener basically!!!!"}
{"text":"They advertise that they deliver to your room and ask for your room number but they don't tell you that most hotel's don't let the drivers inside. I had to go down stairs to get the pizza and the driver wasn't even where he said he was. And then the pizza looked like it had been sitting out for an hour. It was cold and looks old. I would never order from here again."}
{"text":"Starting to get really annoyed with Bona's unsolicited junk mail crammed twice-weekly into the doorjams at our apartment complex.   NO SOLICITING!"}
{"text":"I've had food from here a few times and it has always been good.  The first two times my hubby and I had pizza and wings.  The wings are good (well good for Las Vegas), meaning they are a decent size, they aren't dripping in grease, and when you order hot, they are actually kind of hot.  The pizza is really good as well.  We have tried the cheese pizza (which is a great deal, a large cheese for $8!  Cheaper than Walmart!) and the Rustica Pizza (roasted red peppers, chicken, artichokes).  The delivery was fast, it only took them like 30 minutes when they told me 45.  Today we actually went in to eat.  I ordered the Penne a la vodka and a Caesar salad, my mom had the chicken sorrentino (chicken breast topped with eggplant and mozz) and a house salad, my hubby had the chicken philly, and my dad had the sausage and pepper sandwich.  We were all happy with the food.    The salads were a good size portion and you could probably spit them between two people.  I LOVED the Caesar salad because the dressing was homemade, therefore it was REAL Caesar dressing.  You could taste the garlic and it had just a hint of anchovy flavor, totally brought me back to my childhood.  The house salad was a mixed green salad with some tomatoes and balsamic vinegar (for only $3, I think that is cheaper than Mickey Ds) and my mom really liked it.  The salads came with these yummy homemade rolls that were hot out of the oven.  The Penne a la vodka was delicous, very creamy and tasty and there was so much of it, I will be having it for dinner later tonight.  The chicken sorrentino was also a good size portion chicken breast served on top of linguine, my mom took half of hers home.  The sandwiches were a decent size and my dad (I consider him an expert in sausage and peppers since it is one of his signature dishes), really enjoyed the sandwich.  The sandwiches came with crinkle cut fries, which is a score in my book cause I hate skinny fries.  Oh and the cool thing was that the owner was doing everything himself.  He waited on us, cooked our food, and took orders over the phone.  Totally friendly guy.  Since Cuginos is on the other side of the city, Bona pizza is where we will be getting our Italian food on the West side!"}
{"text":"Avoid this place.  They are a scam...  They stick obnoxious flyers under the doors of hotels.  When they get into trouble, they just change their name and number to something else."}
{"text":"this is my favorite italian restaurant, my coworker and I have been pretty sad ever since they closed, and we don't know where to eat good italian food now, I love how the chef Nick made everything from scratch, I can feel the passion from him as I watch him cook, really sweet guy and I can tell he care about what his customers think about his food a lot.  If anyone know where he is please let us know.  It's a pity that small and truly outstanding restaurant don't last long, he would have been better if he's at better location...If I ever get a hold of where the chef is, I'm totally willing to pay him to cook me a meal."}
{"text":"Pizza was hot, delicious and great price. Fast delivery. Great appetizers as well.  The margherita pizza was awesome!"}
{"text":"I started reading all the reviews about the horrible delivery service after I had already placed my order and I was wondering what I had just gotten myself into.  As I was reading through everyone's bad experiences, there was the knock on the door of my hotel- 15 minutes ahead of when I expected which was perfect since it was already 10PM and I was hungry.  I had been in town working the entire day and was thinking about how hungry I was when walking back into my room.  As I picked up the flyer off the floor I thought to myself \"these people know I'm tired and hungry and don't want to run back out. I'll order from them\".  Can't honestly see why everyone else was disappointed. The food was good- it's the usual pizza place fare which is pretty hard to screw up.  If it's late and you're hungry and don't feel like running out anywhere, I'd say go for it!"}
{"text":"Picked up a pie to go and here are my thoughts... First off, charging an additional $1 for using a credit card is BS, period. Not to mention it's against the user's agreement that businesses must agree to when utilizing CC companies. On to the food... The toppings were a bit on the light side, meaning quantity of mushrooms & roasted peppers, but were fresh and flavorful. The crust, NY style, was very good and I really enjoyed the outer edges which very bubbly and light. When it comes to the sauce it was too sweet for my taste. With that being said it was still good and had a homemade taste to it that I enjoyed but for me I'd want them to experiment with their sauce a little more and have it a little more balanced in regards to this. Would I go back? Yes, but for me there are better options out there that come up with a more balanced pizza in regards to quantity of ingredients and the flavor of the sauce."}
