{"text":"Very charming new bakery with a great menu. I had the Fresh Turkey Sandwich on a croissant. The sliced green apples in the sandwich tasted amazing! Gourmet quality food at a fair price and the service was excellent."}
{"text":"Awesome customer service! And the butter croissants here are pure excellence. I also got the chocolate croissant which was just as wonderful. Definitely recommend!!"}
{"text":"I had an appointment in the vicinity but was early, so decided to stop in at Le Petit for lunch.  Wow, right off the bat, I was impressed.  Nice decor, friendly and helpful staff, and nicely presented food selections greet you as you walk in.  I had a ham & cheese croissant, a latte, and a lemon cupcake for lunch.  The croissant came with a very small salad.  My lunch impressed with great flavor, fresh ingredients, nice presentation - was brought to my table on a tray by the woman who waited on me, more like a nice restaurant than a neighborhood coffee shop.  One of the nicest small places I've been to in Las Vegas.  Good food with class!  Loved it."}
{"text":"This little French bakery is such a delight.  First time there and loved the cozy feeling it had and couldn't believe all the pastries and cookies and of course all their great salads and sandwiches.  Stacy the manager is such a delight herself!  I love all their coffee choices and you have to try their French press!!  I will definitely be going back for more.  So hurry on over....never a disappointment!  Rae K."}
{"text":"Spent about an hour here while waiting for my grandfather who was at the cancer center in the same parking area. I had an extremely pleasant and delicious experience.  Enjoyed fresh (so fresh the french press was brought to my table to press and pour myself) delicious green tea and an apple brie almond salad.  I was a little bit skeptical of the combination of ingredients in the salad but after one bite I was hooked!  The brie wasn't too strong and the julienne'd apples complemented the bitterness of the greens perfectly.   The food was brought out promptly, I didn't even have time to peek completely through one of the many vogue magazines set out in front of two comfortable chairs.    The ambiance is wonderful, great soft jazz playing in the background, nice varied seating options and perfectly simple little decorations.  Pleasantly surprised at this delightful little cafe, where the ladies working there were almost as, if not more pleasant than the place itself.  **Stayed for long enough to order more - macaroons were lovely as was the capuccino"}
{"text":"Tried this place out because my son had a doctor appointment nearby and based off the reviews on yelp. Was not disappointed.  Was immediately greeted by staff and asked if I wanted to view the menu during my short wait to order. I opted for the chicken pesto sandwich and a salted caramel cookie. The sandwich was delicious and made panini style with mozzarella and roasted red peppers. The side salad was made with a lovely shallot vinaigrette. My only complaint was that the side salad could have been a bit larger, as it was so delicious. The salted caramel cookie was chewy and soft and a great treat.  Will definitely return to this little neighborhood gem. Highly recommend you check it out."}
{"text":"This is a great shop with people that care. The best place to get a great cappuccino made with hand crafted coffee."}
{"text":"A new bakery! Great service and quality desserts. I tried the chocolate chip cookies and the lavender ones and loved both. Everyone is really friendly."}
{"text":"Amazing service by Sandra Mallut and staff!  Definitely try the herbs de Provence shortbread,  the Madeleines are amazing as well.   Most importantly,  they add a personal touch to satiate your tastes.  Ordered a catered lunch for our meeting and everyone in the meeting was impressed.  Asparagus and leek quiche is a must try..  awesome!  Thanks gals!"}
{"text":"First time here but won't be the last!  The veggie crepe was so DELICIOUS!  Deb the chef is so adorable too and super friendly!"}
{"text":"Exceeds high expectations . Romantic , delicious food and beveages . Service and enviroment is comfortable and elegant . Incredible bakery & cafe ."}
{"text":"Fresh and friendly French cafe! Great service, great coffees and teas. The turkey apple brie sandwich is excellent. The atmosphere is bright and niche. Very comfortable.  I love supporting local business, and this cafe does not disappoint!"}
{"text":"An wonderful surprise discovery. By far, one of the best cups of coffee we've had in the valley. Service was superb, and the croissants divine. Their signature lavender cake was a sensory experience, unfolding in layers of flavor, while  the salted caramel cookie was perfectly balanced. We had a lovely conversation with both the owner and chef, who were wonderfully engaging and helpful. Looking forward to our next visit."}
{"text":"Just found this amazing coffee shop, food is fresh an macaroons were the best. Highly recommend this place. Emily thank you for everything we will be back"}
{"text":"I dropped in on impulse and by the demand of a rumbling stomach when I had some time to kill before an appointment. I'm sad to realize, only because I'm moving out of Vegas next week, that I hadn't found this place sooner. Honestly I'd never go to another cafe again if I could go here anytime I wanted. The service was fantastic, probably the best I've had in this city and I've been here my entire life. I got the quiche Lorraine and a tea. Definitely in the top 2 breakfasts I've ever had, and absolutely the best quiche I've ever had. I highly recommend this place to everyone if they want amazing food and service with a nice calming ambiance. I've give it 10 stars if I could."}
{"text":"Nice place ! Nice people ! Good food ! I truly recommend this place to have a coffee, a lunch or a very good pastries ! I'm French and tried many French places in vegas and this one is really good. The owner offered us profiteroles and a crème brûlée for us to try ! It was so nice to him. Will come back :)"}
{"text":"Great little cafe and restaurant to grab a bite to eat! Relaxed atmosphere and the owner and staff are very sweet! Good food, coffee, and pastries! Will definitely be returning soon."}
{"text":"I was super impressed by this cute bakery/ cafe. The chicken salad sandwich was so light in taste and I chose to have it on a yummy baguette. My mom ordered the vegetarian crepe and liked that as well. The vibe in here is super nice. It has a fancy touch without being pretentious. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"The second we walked in we were greeted with welcoming smiles! It's so beautifully decorated and makes you feel as though you left Las Vegas and are now in France! We ordered cappuccinos made of almond milk, quite delicious, and a seasonal berries crepe. One of the best crepes I have ever eaten. We had to take one to go to share with everyone at home. The owner is lovely and so is everyone behind the counter. We can't wait to go back, absolutely wonderful experience. :)"}
{"text":"Tucked away slice of Paris! I had the croque madame sandwich and it was to die for! As well as the latte! Everything tasted perfect and parisian. They had some croissants and quiches that I'll have to be back in for soon! Thanks to the staff for helping me with all my decision making! Au revoir!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing coffee and pastries. Emily the owner provided us with phenomenal service and hospitality. Can't recommend high enough!"}
{"text":"This place is a cute little shop that I enjoyed being at.  I met my beautiful friend here that I haven't seen in over 15+yrs and it was the perfect spot.  It is quiet and the service was great! The girls were friendly and attentive. We were here for over 2 hrs and they checked on us throughout the our time here. I can't speak for the food because I only ordered an iced mocha latte which was good.   They also offer military discount which again is rare out here so I was very pleased to hear that!   I recommend this family owned coffee shop to everyone!"}
{"text":"A wonderful alternative to the typical greasy American breakfast experience.  Everything was carefully prepared and very tasty."}
{"text":"Stopped by for breakfast for the first time before visiting my brother at Southern Hills Hospital. Had the cinnamon & sugar crepe and French press coffee while my daughter had the croque monsieur. Food was tasty but portions were smaller than expected. Also bought some pastries to go and highly recommend the almond croissant. My only complaint is that they charge extra for creamer with my coffee which I think should have been mentioned before ringing up. Otherwise, just include it with the price of the coffee so people won't feel like they're being nickel and dimed. Asked for a to- go cup for my coffee since it was good for a few servings but left the cup on my table by accident. Went right back after 15 minutes and the staff had tossed it out. They didn't even offer to replace it with regular brewed coffee since I went back for it. It's the little things that will earn repeat business from customers."}
{"text":"This lovely little cafe is hiding just off the 215 at Sunset. The vanilla latte I ordered was beautiful - with decorative foam- and delicious. The service was great. Four of us had a meeting there and two of us had croissants- and ate every morsel- almost licking the plate. The staff was very friendly, and didn't mind that we were holding a meeting at the Cafe. We will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Great food, very homy food. Emily was wonderful, always attending to our needs. Very happy and cheerfully staff. The coffee and the food were great, made with quality ingredients.   I'll definitely be going back again for breakfast and coffee."}
{"text":"A nice little Cafe, good food, good coffee, and friendly staff. Close to Seven Hills Hospital and Comprehensive Cancer Center of Nevada"}
{"text":"Finally had the chance to stop by this little coffee shop and cafe. Love! It was love upon entry for me daughter and I. Not just the ambience but the people and the coffee/ treats we enjoyed. We will be back again and next time trying a crepe!"}
{"text":"Had the espresso, had their latte, and in process of having their French Press. Yes I'm having my coffee fix for the day lol but this place, in my opinion, has the best tasting coffee beans I have ever had. Their Chicken Pesto sandwich is delicious, and their customer I've experienced is nothing but exceptional. Congratulations on 2 years and I'm looking forward to forever ;)"}
{"text":"Delightful bakery, lunch, and coffee.  Ordered twice, very good food and service.  Will alwats stop in for a bite when in the area."}
{"text":"Wonderful brunch - super friendly service, comfortable atmosphere, and incredible food. And a really really great cup of coffee!"}
{"text":"I can not speak highly enough of this place. Everything is perfect. The sandwiches are fresh and delicious. The pastries are always warm crispy. Even the staff is willing to go out of there way to help accommodate any order. I frequent this bakery at least once a week and can not say how much I enjoy it every time."}
{"text":"Amazing customer service is what really makes this place, I mean other than the decor, the feel and the food.   The food is fresh and they make it right in front of you which to me is pretty neat because I like to know what goes on when someone is preparing my food. I've tried their turkey apple and Brie sand which and truly enjoyed how fresh all the ingredients were.  Try their lavender cookies, they are pretty amazing, and go well together with their lattes."}
{"text":"Felt like something quick and light to eat. Yelped it and found this cute little French cafe. Thanks yelp, you did not lead us astray. And yes...I got a croissant. And yes.....it was amazing!! I ordered the plain butter croissant - delicate and flaky. The chocolate chip cookie was really good too. The girl behind the counter, Sam was so sweet and friendly. I was there with my boyfriend but if I was still dating , this would be a perfect place for a quick coffee online date. The decor is tasteful and charming. The presentation  of a simple croissant was done beautifully. I would highly recommend this place. Let's support the small local cafes instead of making Starbucks richer."}
{"text":"Had the best first (and definitely not the last) visit to Le Petit! Loved everything we ordered especially the chocolate croissants!  It just melts in your mouth.  We will be back for more!!!"}
{"text":"Great customer service! And even greater food! Highly recommend the lavender short bread, very delicious"}
{"text":"Love this place.  There seems to be an influx of French bakeries ... this one is one of the better.     Excellent coffee (don't accidentally walk in to the coffee shop next door - not the same place).  Excellent in-house made pastries.  VERY friendly staff.  Very clean kitchen and cafe."}
{"text":"Wow!  So happy I stopped here this morning!  I Love this little cafe-coffee shop!    Entry...Fun Warming and Trendy Interior...So fun!  True cafe feel! Coffee...Perfect! Smooth yet rich in flavor. Free WiFi Employees...super sweet.   I was pleasantly surprised by this little shop I drive by every day and have never stopped.  Everyone was very welcoming and I loved the look right away.  I ordered an americano to be safe and test the waters. It tasted amazing but wasn't hot at all.  The owner didn't seem to hesitate when I told her and she took care of it right away.  My second cup~perfect!  Such a great vibe for work and visiting!  I will be back!"}
{"text":"Whenever I need to get away I go to my happy place. This little piece of Paris is so charming. Emily, the owner gave a warm greeting and chatted pleasantly with me. Their 2 pastry chefs never disappoint with their fresh baked offerings.  Crepes made to order are perfect.  The only thing mot baked from scratch is the croissants and that is because they import the dough from France directly and bake it off here! I guess we can forgive that.  I worked at Walt Disney World in Florida and stepping in here is like being in EPCOT Center again with all the attention to detail and much less humidity."}
{"text":"will never go there again.  took forever and only to screw up my order. horrible service.  management does not care about customer service so good luck!  i ordered a ham/swiss and turkey sandwich which i was charged for and stated clearly on my receipt! when i reached home the sandwich had just turkey 'no ham and no swiss'. i left a 20 percent tip to add! called to inform them and management said i was charged appropriately even though half of the sandwich was missing!!! they put me on hold and came back to say..what do you want us to do!?! not a great way to start off with a small business. i should have followed my first mind and went to honeybaked ham! awesome service there and much better food. watch out medical center employees. avoid at all costs. rude management."}
{"text":"Great fresh food and very friendly. I only wish they were open seller than 8am. So many businesses around the area that open at 8am. Would love to snag a coffee before work! :)"}
{"text":"Great service and staff. The food is delicious with some great desserts as well. My daughter loves the breakfast classic and my wife loves the apple Brie almond salad. I switch my food choice every time and have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"A great addition to the fastest-growing neighborhood in Vegas.  Both food and service of top-notch, world-class quality."}
{"text":"Amazing atmosphere! Coffee is amazing!  Emily the owner is amazing and wonderful!! The desert menu is really good the pastries are fresh!"}
{"text":"This place is really adorable and earns its 5 stars. We came in and got a quiche Loraine and a chocolate chip cookie, both were great. The price point was reasonable, combined it was under 8 dollars and came with a side salad. I will certainly be back."}
{"text":"This delightful new French Café is a welcome breath of fresh air to the south west Vegas community. Charmingly hosted by warm and friendly staff, the atmosphere is classically European and beautifully decorated.  One of the best café lattes I've had in Vegas with beans provided exclusively to them by black drop coffee beans.  I had the Turkey apple and brie baguette with a salad which was delicious. The homely smell of freshly baked biscuits and breads will make this new Las Vegas gem a regular drop In for me! Well done Le Petit Café."}
{"text":"What an adorable cafe! I normally don't go to a cafe on my own, but I'm glad I did this time! I was greeted right away as I entered and I love the cute and trendy vibe of the place. I felt relaxed and at ease dining alone and the french music playing in the background added to the ambience. The cappuccino was tasty and strong and the chocolate croissant was freshly baked, buttery and flaky...just how I would imagine it would be in Paris...J'adore Le Petit Café and Bakery!"}
{"text":"Bonjour! This cafe welcomes you to a little taste of France.    I am one lucky girl to dine here with a Yelp friend.  Lauren and I had big appetites.  We split the Croque Madame, Quiche Lorraine and Apple Cinnamon Crepe.  It was all a delight.    The Croque Madame had a rich a flavorful bite.  It is a lovely presentation with the side salad.  The Quiche Lorraine was no slouch.  It was light and fluffy with a delicate crust.  It was also a beautiful plate with the salad served on the side.  The Crepe hit every taste bud.  The sweet and savory crepe was filled with green apples wrapped in a fresh crepe.  Not to mention the fresh cream certainly complimented the sprinkling of cinnamon and sugar.  It is very indulgent.    When you think we're done, you thought wrong.  They have fresh pastries calling our name.  The Salted caramel cookie is so perfect that I wish I would've taken some home.  There is a delicious balance of the caramel/cookie.  And if you like caramel, don't pass up the salted caramel cupcake.  Moist and decadent.  There was definitely a lot of flavor packed into a mini cupcake.    It was my first try of a lavender cake.  I guess it was just too much lavender flavor for me.  The cake itself was light and moist.  Like I said, just a bit too much lavender for me.    The wonderful ladies here are so welcoming and friendly.  I love the first rate customer service they offer.  They make your visit comfortable which is why I'm hoping I'll be back soon.  Thank you for an amazing experience."}
{"text":"You don't have to twist my arm to get me into a French bakery. The Allure of a freshly made macaron is enough.   A super cute little venue amongst the medical center off of 215 and Durango. This little cafe has coffee lunch and pastries all made in in-house... Except for the butter croissants which are imported from France! Everything was superb. I would recommend a French press coffee over an espresso, as I could tell they are more of a bakery than a coffee shop. A perfect place to wait on your medical records, meet someone, or celebrate with a macaroon after you find out that your suspicious mole is benign!"}
{"text":"I went in on a whim and ordered an herbal tea, chicken noodle soup, and an apple pastry. All of the above were delicious, way exceeded my expectations. The staff was super friendly and helpful. Only taking away one star because 1) it might have been a fluke, but on my laptop at least, the WiFi was incredibly slow, and 2) I was there near closing time (left about an hour before) and the music was turned up from chill Coldplay to somewhat profane hip hop. Not the chill atmosphere I had been experiencing up to that point, and it was uncomfortable.  There's not a whole ton of seating space for groups, though I did notice an upstairs... maybe that had additional seating? It's a very cozy, themed coffee shop."}
{"text":"This is our favorite French cafe in Vegas. The food was fantastic and the staff was wonderful. We had a savory crepe, a croque monsieur, a creme brûlée, a piece of lavender cake, a piece of eclair, and a French sandwich. The last time we had French food this good was in Paris so we will definitely go back."}
{"text":"I have been searching Las Vegas for a good bakery for a very long time... Le Petit is the best I've found! It's maybe a $10 Uber Ride from the Strip. I haven't had Crepe's this good since I was in Paris.The Breakfast Classic Sandwhich was absolutely mouth watering! The Jumbo Cookie melts in your mouth. I could go on and on forever!  The service exceeded my expectations. I felt as though I was visiting family. Very warm and welcoming! I would highly recommend this business to all my friends and family."}
{"text":"Cute cafe & bakery with delicious food! I had the Creme Brûlée and shared a Cranberry Oatmeal Cookie... oh so good!! My mom had the Vegetarian Crepe and said it was just as delicious! The Americano coffee was perfectly balanced. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Best croissants I have ever had, after I eat one I think about it the rest of the week! Great coffee too! Great for breakfast and lunch! I've been here a couple times and will keep coming back so I can try the whole menu. So far I've had an almond croissant, crepe, turkey croissant sandwich with salad (delicious and fresh) and of course coffee, everything was wonderful!"}
{"text":"I ate here today for lunch at it was so delicious!!!  I had the ham and cheese crepe with seasonal vegetables which were asparagus mushroom red pepper. You can watch them make it. I took home a salted Carmel cookie which was also super yummy. Will be back for sure!!"}
{"text":"I odered a mocha and the espresso tasted burnt. I couldn't drink it. I also ordered the veggie quiche of the day and the \"side salad\" it comes with was a joke. (See pic) The only thing that turned out right was the banana crepe my son ordered. When this place first opened it was delicious. I used to enjoy coming here, but this will be the last time. Baguette cafe is right down the street and is always consistent with quality, flavor, and value."}
{"text":"Had an MRI at Steinberg around the corner from this place and my husband came in for a croissant and an Americano. He was so impressed with the place that he brought mw here when my imaging was complete.  I had a mocha latte that was perfect. Light foam on top and  perfectly chocolaty without being overly sweet. Warmed me right up!   To eat I had the chicken salad sandwich on a baguette and damn, the bread was perfect! Sometimes a baguette will be so crispy outside that it cuts your gums when you take a bite, but this was firm on the outside and french-bread chewy on the inside. The salad itself was perfectly seasoned and the grapes gave it just the right sweetness.   Although we live on the opposite side of town, we will surely be driving out here again to enjoy this place.  And have a raspberry macaroon!! Omg yummy!!!"}
{"text":"Came here with some friends for lunch. So delicious. The chicken salad was phenomenal, and the croissant was fresh. The brownie was also BOMB! My friends loved their meals. The decor is so cute- totally the kind of place you can cuddle up with a book and a coffee and treat for a few hours- and not as loud as Starbucks. Staff was so sweet and attentive. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place!  Great atmosphere, great soothing music, great coffee, and amazing food.  The Quiche Lorraine is delicious.  Portions are just right, side salad is great...love the vinaigrette on the salad, so subtle and pairs well with the salad and fruit as the base.  So good!!  It is a cafe - so you order at the counter and the staff brings the items to you at your table.  Staff is friendly and cordial....great little gem hiding just off Sunset and 215 by the hospital."}
{"text":"Another newly opened French bakery spot! This one has great decor with a variety of seating options and wonderful service from Stacy, Emily, and the other ladies. Visited on opening day to a limited menu of lovely goods, especially enjoyed the Ham & Cheese sandwich. They use fresh Boar's Head meats cut to order, and use a fantastic house-made Dijon dressing for the side salad. Fresh baked goods are also available, and at good pricing. Looking forward to coming back and trying more.  EDIT: Popped in again while in the area. Baked goods were not as fresh. Have given time for them to get settled in as a new business and quality seems lower rather than higher. A friend tried to set up a group brunch here and was required to get food orders a week in advance?"}
{"text":"Cute little bakery/cafe hidden in the medical plaza of southern hills hospital.  I had a banana Nutella crepe and my friend had the breakfast classic. Both were delicious. Staff are super nice. My only suggestion would be to have more breakfast options."}
{"text":"My wife and I dropped by in the late afternoon yesterday.  Emily, the owner, was behind the counter and greeted us with a big smile and warm personality.  The whole place has a great feel and ambiance to it.  It had great energy!  We ordered a cappuccino, a macchiato, an almond croissant and a chocolate croissant.  The coffee is excellent.  The croissants have delectable flavor and texture.  She informed me that they are sent from France and she bakes them.  Some of the best -- if not the best -- you'll find in the Valley.  We live in Anthem, and it's a good drive to get here, but we really liked it.  When in the SW Valley, we will be sure to drop by again......maybe she'll open another store in Anthem?"}
{"text":"Their environment makes me feel like coming to Paris to eat. The food is very good and the staff are super friendly. Great location, and easy to park. Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Beautiful new little breakfast and lunch spot! I had the Turkey sandwich with brie on a toasted croissant --- excellent! My boyfriend had a savory vegetable crepe -- amazing! We both had coffees, and they were very yummy! I highly recommend this place, go support a new local business!"}
{"text":"I took my boyfriend here as he is half French but never had a crepe, creme brûlée or macarons so I took him here. It was very good, he says he liked it a lot. The only thing I'd complain about is the price but most French places have prices like this. So overall, it was good."}
{"text":"Best cup of coffee I have ever had!!! If it were by my house, I would be there all the time. Magnifique!!"}
{"text":"I like this cafe a lot! Drove all way from strip area to try this place and I was glad I did. Lavender shortbread cookies and the lavender cupcakes were so awesome! Had croque madam and it was excellent. My friend had the quiche and she loved it. Our plates were licked clean.  This place is pretty far drive for me but I would def try to go back. It is pretty close to the IKEA store, so if you are going there, you should really swing over to this place. You wont be disappointed.  The place itself is really cute and welcoming. The people there are very nice and accommodating."}
{"text":"Had a great experience in here this morning. I bought a few chocolate croissants for my team. Everyone loved them. My cold brew was great too. The service was awesome as well. We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Must try !! Cutest hidden gem. I love the decor and atmosphere here! Not to mention the super yummy pastry's, lattes, and food. I haven't tried anything I don't like! I do wish there were more vegetarian options but there are a couple really yummy ones!"}
{"text":"What a cute little gem this place is. I often come by to get a sandwich or pastry with the amazing lemonade! The service is great and the staff is amazing. The place is super clean. They have a fantastic assortment of homemade pastries. I hope this small business stays afloat Bc they deserve to be recognized for it all!"}
{"text":"Nothing extremely special. Just a simple French cafè which is perfect for a light breakfast or brunch. Food and portions are close to authentic and the coffee is made very expertly. The only problem I had was the wifi not working for me which won't affect my rating at all because sometimes it is just better to put the phone down and eat :)"}
{"text":"The food was sensational, don't miss the French onion soup. We had the pesto chicken and the magnificent and both were delicious. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Meh.. the crepe had some egg smells which i hated.... coffee was okay....nothing special.  Not sure if I will ever go back when there is tons of great cafe in Vegas nowadays.  And they dont open on Sunday, so whats the point...?"}
{"text":"What a lovely, hidden gem! I discovered this place as I was taking my daughter to her pediatrician. I went in for a cappuccino and realized this is gonna be my new go to cafe. I absolutely love the decor and the atmosphere- it was very calm and pretty. It wasn't your typical Vegas place, and for a moment, I even felt like I was in a cafe in another country. I think the friendly Australian barista had a lot to do with the good vibes since she is so sweet. If you love lavender, this is your spot- they have lavender shortbread , lavender cake and lavender macarons! My cappuccino was perfect. I can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Delicious food! Small quaint little shop. Nice staff and food came out pretty quickly. We got a ham and cheese baguette, croque madame, lavender short bread and raspberry macaron. All were delicious."}
{"text":"The place was clean, friendly, and comfortable.  The food we got was good. Can't say more since we have food allergies and intolerance to gluten, we came because it stated gluten free available but not too many selections. Great coffee though"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times. Great service, all staff were very friendly. I have tried latte, quiche and croissant they were very yummy."}
{"text":"A quaint place to enjoy a hand crafted beverage and a delicious little breakfast or lunch. The service is always friendly and the atmosphere is perfect. I like to take my book and grab a nice cup of tea, they offer a variety of over 10. Try the almond croissants or an ooey gooey chicken pesto panini, both are perfection. This cafe is overall a wonderful place to visit, and I do as often as I can."}
{"text":"I am impressed by this Black Drop coffee. Best I ever had. I like the decor and hospitality of the staff. Great place. I will be going back this week."}
{"text":"I've never been in the restaurant but I ordered delivery.. love the quiche n the Nutella crepe with banana..yummy in my tummy"}
{"text":"Delicious! My fighter wanted a sweet treat and I needed some supper... stopped by and got a chocolate brownie. It was moist and very good. It wasn't too sweet, which was nice. I got a croque madame and since being in Paris 9 years ago, it's the best I've had. It was served with a nice little salad. I also tried their soup of the day, chicken noodle. Again, great flavors and seasoned perfectly! We got it all to-go, but the atmosphere of the cafe was welcoming and quaint. I will defiantly be back to try other things and for sure get some coffee. I'm thinking Saturday brunch to try their quiche."}
{"text":"If near sunset and the 215 this is a great little French place. We love their chicken salad croissant.  I've make a version at home based on theirs! Closed on Sunday's and not open late but a great Saturday afternoon meal.  Love their pesto on anything."}
{"text":"Great new spot in the southwest.  Regular food items and bakery are both great.  I had a croque madam.  Pretty sure I ate it in 5 minutes I was so hungry and the egg was perfect.  Dressing that came with side salad was great as well.  Macaroon and chocolate chip cookie and peach cobbler are great ways to end the meal.  Staff and owner are very pleasant.  Restaurant is really quaint.  Every item we got is memorable.  Recommended!"}
{"text":"I fell upon this place by pure luck. I was just finishing up with my doctor's office and saw it from across the parking lot and decided to go in to check it out. This place is adorable and has a true cafe feel just like Europe. Everyone greeted me warmly and the staff was very knowledgeable about the menu. I got the turkey apple brie sandwich on a baguette and the portion size was more than enough for the small price I paid. I also ordered a chai latte which exceeded my expectations. I was able to take the rest of my sandwich home to eat later. I paid only about $14 for a sandwich/salad big enough for two meals plus a large latte, and the atmosphere is very relaxing with instrumental music playing as I did my homework. I can't wait to return and try some of their pastries too!"}
{"text":"It's very hard to impress me with tea, I was impressed. Great decor. Loved the mandeleine and the brownie bites. Very friendly service. It is a must to stop by and support this great local business."}
{"text":"This French cafe was so awesome! I came in and tried out this restaurant after a doctors appointment nearby, I'm so glad I did.  I ordered the Ham and Swiss breakfast sandwich, two chocolate croissants, and a latte. Everything I ordered was delicious!  The breakfast sandwich was on a flaky buttery croissant, The chocolate croissants were the best, very fresh and always in demand, I took the last two and the friendly owner said she was going to make more.  The ambience was great relaxing and the bakery smelled great, all of the staff was very kind. Definitely recommend this place to everyone!"}
{"text":"Best quiche I've ever had. So fluffy and amazing. The cafe is decorated very cute and the staff is nice. 5 stars all around!"}
{"text":"Cute place near by medical offices. The cafe did not offer much choice in pastries ... went there at 9am after a doc appointment, only couple pastries were displayed everything else were to select from the menu   i ordered the mini apple pies. it was very good and buttery.  following day i wanted to order some for my friend's birthday. i called twice and they couldn't take the order over the phone. i had to call back when the chef is in. Poor customer service ... could they just take my phone and take the order???"}
{"text":"Cute little french cafe! Great food. Loved the hospitality. Customer service was amazing! Helpful, genuine welcome and so classy... served their food with real dishes (not a basket or wrapper) and real utensils (none of that cheap plastic spoon & fork). They waited for me to finish my salad & sandwich then brought my fresh brownie on a plate. Classy move gals! Their food was delightful, bread was freshly baked, roast beef was legit meaty and their au jus sauce was to die for (licked every bit of it). Let's not forget the salad, it was delicious, only wished there was more in the serving cus it was gone in 1 bite. Overall, this was a success! Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Yes, Im a big fan... hey not cause I'm FAT... well, maybe bc i'm fat.  Anyway, this place is great hang out to chill, eat and listen to some french jazz or some french artist neo-soul.  Music that just hits the spot!!! Oh wait FOOD....crepe with ham, veg and cheese .... YEAH!!!! EAT IT!!!! don't forget the sauce!! Almond croissant is good too when warm. I plan to try the whole menu in the near future. Only reason not a 5 star yet is bc i would like to see more croissants like (hint hint) raspberry and almond croissant...LMAO... Either way this place is a must visit . Try it sometime you might like it!!"}
{"text":"This is such a cute place!  I have been here 3 times this past week.  The chai latte is amazing, the americano is delish along with the crepes and other pastries.  I am so happy I found this gem of a place.  The owner is so delightful along with all the other employees."}
{"text":"There are a few \"French\" cafe's in the area. But, this one is by far the most unique and authentic feeling. Friendly staff and a warm ambiance will immediately greet you. The owner is always there and is very approachable. I would recommend the Croque Madame, c'est formidable!"}
{"text":"I love this place, it's my little day time treat! The food is delicious and the staff are so friendly and warm. I'm not a coffee drinker so I get the fresh squeezed juice but my partner loves the coffee here as well and she is so picky with her coffee. Take time to actually grab a seat here, the place is so adorable. I already want another Croque Monsieur"}
{"text":"Desparate for some place to grab a bite to eat in the middle of a commercial office district, I did a quick internet search and found Le Petit Cafe & Bakery. I was just hoping it wasn't one of those sad, underfunded local places that you see all the time. I feel so bad for those establishments.   Luckily for me, this place was bright, and the food was very good! Beats the pants off of any chain coffee joint for ambiance, grab a coffee, wonderful pastry or delicious French inspired sandwich.  It is right off the 215 at Sunset so I hope I can remember it is here for a future gastronomic emergency or better yet, a deliberate visit!"}
{"text":"Best banana bread I ever had, French press coffe on point, highly recommend, the prince is fair for what are you getting"}
{"text":"This place was so awesome! They are working on bringing in gluten free crepes. The owner Emily is such a doll! Great atmosphere and great food! Will be returning!!!! Keep up the good work Emily and staff!"}
{"text":"the best croissants! the lavender macaron is good too.i was hesitant to try at 1st but it was good!"}
{"text":"I was very happy to find  this place . Cute inside and very fresh food . I ordered a sandwich and orange juice and my meal cost me 16 dollars. Kinda pricey for one person .. sandwich was delicious . But croissant was small. But still everything is amazing and good . Ordered the chicken maqnifique on croissant. Also a pesto panini sandwich both were so delicious ."}
{"text":"Had the best Chai Latte and quiche - you must come to this cafe- such a cute atmosphere. Wow I'm going to have to order another latte before leaving so yummy"}
{"text":"We tried this new French Cafe' by Southern Hills Hospital!! Sooo Cute inside & their pastries are Fabulous!! We try their Chocolate Croissant, Turtle Brownie, French Macarons, Chocolate Cookie, and their Cold Brew was Amazing!! We met the owner, Emily, She was so nice. Everyone there was so helpful & very attentive.!! We have to come back to try the rest of the menu. Looking forward to our next visit."}
{"text":"There were two coffee shops in the area, but this attracted my eye. Super cute & clean place! Had a Paris/18th century atmosphere. They also recently opened a month ago. The employees were very sweet. They approached us quickly and introduced the place and what they offered. I ordered the cold brew with vanilla almond milk, & it was perfect as is, didn't even have to add sweetener. Also tried the lavender shortbread cookies and raspberry macarons-- I personally thought the lavender cookies were amaze balls! I only am disappointed because I live too far away to come here more often. Definitely will be back if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"The Le Petit Cafe offers a variety of items, pastries, salads, sandwiches and Quiches. Ordering is done at the counter and you are assigned a number and self seating at indoor or outdoor tables. The orders are delivered to your table. Our server Stacy and friendly and helpful.  Items ordered: Club Croissant with ham and mayo served with a salad and a slice of melon Croque Monsieur served with a salad and a slice of melon French Onion Soup with lots of onions and large piece of french bread  Quiche Vegetarienne (potatoes & onions) served with a salad and a slice of melon Americano Coffee - large serving and robust flavor.  All items were fresh, delicious and filling. Add Le Petit Cafe to the growing number of small businesses that deserve local support."}
{"text":"Great little place! Super tasty and quality food with creative menu. I've been here several times and also had delivery. Always great!"}
{"text":"I am happy to have found this cute cafe! It feels like Paris, with fresh croissant and crepes on the menu. Their espresso is top shelf and the staff is so kind and attentive. I'm picking up some very special Valentine's cookies to bring home!"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite cafe in Vegas! I've been a few times and it has never disappointed. The same staff is usually there and they are very helpful and friendly. Everything is made in house and you can tell the freshness. Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"This review is for 4.5 stars.  La Petit Cafe on the outside looks like an unaware sandwich shop right off the highway, but walking in it becomes a quaint, French, lunch destination spot.  Although the location is spotty with cars whizzing by and office buildings surrounding, the Cafe and Bakery holds its own.  The inside has about 10 tables a couch area for lounging.  There are also about 5 smaller tables outdoors when the weather is nice.  Once you order, the server will bring the food out to you, but you more or less will clean up your self.  When I went, it seemed a little understaffed, so it was it took a little longer than I had hoped for my meal to come out - about 25 minutes.  The menu has a nice selection of your French lunch classics like crepes, baguette sandwiches, croque madames, and quiche.  They also some great coffee and complimentary water as needed.  I tried a very good ham and cheese sandwich with an added egg.  The meal came with a very small salad, though more tasty and better looking than your typical house salad, with beets and a side of fresh fruit.  The baguette was fantastic and the added egg made for a more formidable dish.    La Petit is a very nice lunch destination in the area.  My meal came to a little less than $10 for the sandwich meal, but with my work nearby, and an outdoor area suitable for a dog or just to enjoy the weather. I will be back."}
{"text":"This is a must try! Service, food, coffee, and ambiance all top notch! Visited a few times recently and had vegetarian quiche, assorted crepes, crossiant breakfast sandwich, and the turkey apple Brie croissant...all amazing! Adorable, French decor and music. All homemade bakery items as well! Awesome place and will return often!"}
{"text":"Almond banana bread pudding was BOMB! Talk about foodgarsm, also had the assorted berries crepes, matcha green tea, and French press coffee, all absolutely amazing. Great food and drinks and great service  My new favorite spot!"}
{"text":"I love places like this. Little hole in the wall eateries that have an amazing atmosphere and employees. The food was delicious! I got the Croque Madame and everything about it was tasty. The white sauce made the dish as well as the crust on the French country loaf. The staff were all polite and helpful in making suggestions on what to eat. I definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Their out-of-the-way location probably doesn't draw many passerby's, no doubt relying on traffic from the nearby hospital and office parks. But, it's a spot worth visiting if you're in the area  Their bread pudding looked small as it arrived at the table, but was filling. Served warm, the center was soft and soaked through with custard. The top was drizzled with caramel and also came with a side of whipped cream. Cookies were excellent. Their chocolate chip cookie was soft and chewy through the center with some crispness around the edges. The salted caramel was even better. So chewy and chock full of caramel. They could have dialed back the salt, but it still provided a nice contrast to the sweetness of the other components.   For a savory option, you can't go wrong with the roast beef au jus sandwich ($7.95). While it is a little small, the roast beef and au jus make for a magical combination. It also came with a side salad.  The least impressive item I've tried was their almond croissant. Soft, thick, and doughy don't make for good croissant qualities. Thankfully, there are plenty of other reasons to dine here.  3.5 Stars"}
{"text":"I am now lowering my rating of this eatery and we will not return ever ..reason..after learning the food made us ill they were unaccountable.  And the dishes were not altered to accomodate us.  They can stay true to their menu..dried out crepes.  I was trying to kind but when an owner negates a legitimate concern and says things that are not true...the public deserves to know.  Eat at your own risk.  They obviously don't care about patrons."}
{"text":"I'm so excited about this place, not because the staff is exceptional with the care and explanation of the culinary surprises that caress your taste buds but for the obvious love they have for everyone that walks in their doors.   For me the Americana flatbread is a must have with smokey bacon, cheese and a egg yolk sitting top of a puff pastry.  Rich and light in texture but it'll have your taste buds shouting for more. The buttery croissant is also a light and delicious feast with the French pressed coffee. You are sure to love this cafe as much as I've loved it."}
{"text":"OMG......just happened upon this place by accident and thank God we did!!!!  The coffee is unreal delicious and the fresh pastries are out of this world.  I have Celiac disease (can't eat gluten) but no worries, they have lots of GFree options.  Coconut macaroons, chicken salad with grapes and special sauce, salads, crème brule and quiche cups!!!  All fresh made in house.  Plus they hand cut their own meats for sandwiches and fresh croissants, cake cupcakes, fresh pressed lemonade and limeade and so much more!  WOW is all I can say!   The young couple who started this business spent after hours time talking with us and made us feel so cozy!  They really have set the bar high for a small coffee cafe and bakery!  My new favorite place.  It's worth the drive from anywhere in town!!!"}
{"text":"My GOOOOOODDNESS!!! The most divine pastries and yummy yummy yummy sandwiches!! THEE BEST Classic Club on a croissant  The chocolate cupcake is so rich and such a perfect texture! The most tasty raspberry macaroon  UGH! Incredible! And not to mention the Lavender bread bites- ugh, definitely the best bite with a nice cup of coffee! A MUST GO TO BEAUTIFUL SPOT!"}
{"text":"Encountered a second culinary \"la petite mort\" mort moment. This place is awesome. The almond croissants are out of this world amazing. Love what these guys do here. I will remain a regular here for the rest of my life."}
{"text":"Absolutely everything about this adorable French cafe was delicious and authentic! The decor was gorgeous, the service was genuine (thank you Emily & Tiana) and the food and pastries were out of this world! My mother and I enjoyed every moment of our lunch and cannot wait to return! I cannot say enough good things about this gorgeous little bistro - a piece of Paris right here in Vegas minus the jet lag! I am hoping and praying they open for dinner and brunch ASAP!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! From decor to coffee to food.  I cannot believe I haven't tried it before... Staff is very friendly. Atmosphere and menu reminds of European cafés. Being from that part of the world I miss that type of places terribly.  They even have outside sitting in a cute little patio. So happy I tried them out! I had Ham & Cheese crepe, my son had a muffin and my mom tried their creme brûlée (in addition to French press tea and delicious latte). Everything was amazing.   I will definitely be a regular!  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"We love French bakeries. And we had been searching for a good one in Las Vegas. We found it at Le Petit. The croissants and crepes were fantastic. It's a bit of a drive for us but I imagine that we'll be making the occasional visit to get our fix.  The food was delicious. The service was great. The location is just a little out of the way."}
{"text":"Great cafe! Awesome food, great atmosphere! The amount of exquisitely made food here, is quite startling. I came here expecting jut a regular meal and left wanting to surrender at every slight confrontation. To say the least, this place is pretty deja vu. That's French for amazing."}
{"text":"Love the French theme! Very comfortable to study or catch up with friends. Cute little personal French press and the buttery croissant was perfection!"}
{"text":"I felt compelled to write a review at this very moment because I just ate one of their lemon macarons ($2.55 each) and it was one of the best macarons I've ever had. So good! I've also tried the strawberry and chocolate macarons which are delicious as well. Bonus - the macarons are all gluten free.  This place is cute and spacious and is a great spot to chat with friends or plug into your laptop and get some work done (they have wi-fi). The coffee is really good. My daily coffee is usually iced coffee with extra cream. Here, it's a latte ($4.00) which is significantly more expensive for me than my go-to but it's definitely worth it!  Aside from the coffee and macarons, my brother and I have both tried some of their savory dishes. He's had the Roast Beef Au Jus Sandwich ($7.95) and I've had the Apple, Brie, and Almond Salad ($5.95). We both agree that the food is quite good and the prices are great.  I definitely recommend this place! I will probably be back tomorrow to try a different macaron flavor :)"}
{"text":"They just open. All stuff was very nice and helpful ! This is definitely my to go coffee spot since today ! Love this place I'll tell all my friends."}
{"text":"I was impressed by this cafe the first time I walked in. From the friendly atmosphere to various seating now extended outside in the front. There's many options aside from pastries and they are kid friendly, clean and offer a bathroom.   I came in to get one pastry and head out instead I purchased two pastries and a latte. The almond croissant and chocolate croissant were perfect. My chai coffee was amaze balls! The best I've ever had which says something because I like coffee with my oxygen ;) it was light and perfect. Truly impressive. I sat in to dine with both kids. We enjoyed the large grand couch and talked about the gorgeous mirror behind the counter and photos on the wall and colored in their coloring books. Our order didn't take long before they brought it to us.   Pastries we're fresh and perfectly flaky.   My kids were given mini chinos. Basically foam but in fancy cups! That's was really nice and unexpected. Not to mention it kept their hands out of my foam!   My favorites since have been the croissant turkey apple Brie sandwich which I mostly order through the yelp pick up app and the vegetable and ham crepe. You must try that chai tea latte with vanilla notes! That apple galette is drool worthy.   I just love this place!"}
{"text":"With years spending in London for my studies I had a bond with the local cafe or coffee shop around the area. This was mainly due to the familiar friendly staff, ofcourse my morning latte and great food!!   I had the same feel at Le Petite today!! Stacy was phenomenal and amazing at her guest service along with the latte she made and kudos to the chef who made the apple and Brie salad. Amazing food and amazing staff.   Love the decor and love the concept. Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"My new favorite French cafe in the southwest side! Staff was very friendly and attentive. The decor is quant and beautiful. I especially love the couch in the corner. They have an outdoor area but it does not have shade. The fresh flowers on the table were a lovely touch. I had a breve and lavender shortbread cookies and I had the turkey, apple and Brie sandwich, which was very flavorful. I'll definitely be back here this week! FYI they are closed Sundays."}
{"text":"I was came to see my doctor and was so glad to be back at Le Petit. I needed a little something, but more substantial than a croissant and tried the croissant bread pudding. Yes, I know, it's made with left over croissants, but it was good. It came with a side of whipped cream, and it was chocolatey. It wasn't overly sweet but I liked the comfort bread pudding gives. I was satiated but when I looked over at the next table who was having a sandwich, I wished I could have ordered that too. It's nice to be at small cafe like Le Petit where I don't feel like I'm in Vegas but maybe in somewhere in San Francisco. It's my go to spot when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"I went here to pick up some croissants and drinks. The croissants were really yummy. I got bunch of regular ones and chocolate ones, and they were both equally good. The chocolate was not too sweet, but just enough to give me some morning energy and sweetness. They brew the earl grey tea for you upon ordering, which was very thickly brewed and nice.   I would say their price is higher than other bakeries, but I would say its still worth it."}
{"text":"Classic egg sandwich with a vanilla latte,  very nice.  The croissants are amazing so is the coffee.  Very relaxed setting with attentive staff.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"When Yelp does you right, Yelp takes you here.   Latte along with a Ham, Cheese and Vegetable Crepe w/ the sauce with a name that escapes me. Light and tasty is the best I can do with words. So dang good.   The owner is a sweetheart. She always says hello. They always play jazzy music, the decor is vintage and cute. I love this place. The hubs decided that this is our go to place for our weekend outings and I couldn't agree more! They have an outdoor seating but now that it's getting hot, I don't think you'll see us outside but for those nice temperature days, it's pretty!"}
{"text":"LPCB was so delicious and the customer service was fabulous. We were happy to discover this gem of a café when we decided to venture off the strip to do some hiking in the area. I had a croissant sandwich and tea and my fiancé has the croque monsieur and coffee. We topped it off with some delicious baked goods. The staff were so friendly and helpful. We tried to come back again the next day on our way out of town, but were sad to learn that they aren't open on Sundays. We will definitely be back next time we visit Vegas, and will recommend it to all our friends in the meantime."}
{"text":"Recently discovered this cafe and we will surely be back.  Lovely ambiance, friendly and efficient service, good cappuccino, excellent quiche, the best almond croissant and chicken salad croissant sandwich.  We keep coming back!"}
{"text":"I checked this place out late afternoon and it's in a business complex area but they do really well with the ambiance. Nice cafe to grab your laptop and do a bit of work. I ordered the Croquet Masuer which was really great. The bread was incredible. I had a hot chocolate and a matcha tea cupcake which I have to say the icing was simply delicious. It was a butter cream frosting. I would go back for sure. I was too late for pastries but they clearly knew what they were doing in that department so I'd enjoy trying out their croissants next time!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing and the staff was super friendly. During my first visit, they were all very welcoming and took their time to explain and go through the menu with us giving off recommendations as well. It is a small and quiet cafe with a touch of France. It's a little on the pricier side for a cafe but totally worth the money!! Not much of a wait for the food either. Will definitely come back"}
{"text":"I found the cutest and nicest cafe! I came out here for doctors appointment and stopped in It is so nice ! Pastry was homemade, fresh and delish! The person who waited on me ( might have been the owner) was so helpful and pleasant, couldn't have been any nicer! What a wonderful cafe Next time I'm going to have lunch because it looked fantastic !"}
{"text":"We drove all the way from the strip to have a croissant. We just had a hunch that we would enjoy this place. We ended up scarfing down a croque madam, croissant and a salted caramel white chocolate with a large french press coffee.  Spoke with the lovely owner, Emily, who told us that she purchases the par-baked croissants directly from Paris. They really are delicious imo. Flaky and buttery. I've gone to most of the pastry shops on the strip and I was never that impressed. We are always happy to support a local business!  Ambiance: The cafe is spacious with charming bistro decor. I'm reminded of my college travels to Paris with journal in tow pouring out my inner soul from pen to paper. Great place to meet up with your girlfriends!  Service: Very attentive and we made a request for condensed milk (we're Southeast Asian...condensed milk is in our blood) and they were generous."}
{"text":"Le Petit Café & Bakery, but saveur immense. This amazing café isn't very close to home for me, but I'll definitely make the trip back soon.  The shop is located near 215/ Sunset in a corporate area. There is plenty of parking and the location is easy to access. The inside of the shop is very cute with a large couch and cute tables. It's obvious that care was given in the details of the decorating and design of the shop. I really enjoyed the ambiance. The staff was welcoming and friendly. That definitely added to the warm, fuzzy feeling of the dining experience.  Bethany E. found this cute bakery and we made plans to meet up for a Saturday lunch. What a lunch it was! We like to order several items and share so that we can try a variety of items.   Croque Madame- like a croque monsieur, but with a fried egg on top and served with a small green salad and a slice of cantaloupe. The amount of flavor in this was amazing. The bread was tasty and the ham had a nice flavor and crisp to it (I'm not normally even big on ham). The cheese on this dish really made the overall flavor pop. Loved this item.  Quiche Lorraine- a modest slice of quiche with a small green salad and a slice of cantaloupe. The quiche had a lovely richness to it and a perfectly flaky crust. I also loved this dish.  Apple, Cinnamon, Caramel, & Sugar Crepe- this was one of the larger items that we ordered. Good thing since it tasted amazing. The crepe was perfectly light and delicious. The caramel and green apple inside were perfection with the delicious crepe. I absolutely recommend this item as well.  Lavender Cake- this was really packed with lavender. I enjoy lavender treats, but this was a little heavy on the lavender for me. The cake itself was moist and the frosting on the cake was tasty too.   Raspberry Macaron- perfect flavor and texture. I enjoyed this and would love to try more flavors in the future.  Salted Caramel Cupcake- a stand out for sure. We decided that anything with caramel here is going to be the best. This was the type of dessert that stops you in your tracks with its incredible flavor.  Chocolate Cupcake- very good with a nice moist cake and a frosting that tasted like it had a hint of mocha.  Salted Caramel Cookie- one of my favorites of the desserts we tried. It had a bit of chewiness with a slight crisp. The caramel really made this dessert amazing.  I'll definitely be back for more delicious treats!"}
{"text":"This place has cute French decor from the second you drive up. It's very whimsical which I like. I came here to work on my lap top and seating next to a plug is limited and their wi-fi is slow so I don't recommend coming here to work. If you're in the mood for pastries like macaroons and croissants and great coffee then this is your place. Staff was very helpful as well in helping me choose what I wanted to order and set up their tricky wi fi. There is a lounge area with couches and tables set up for dining. They serve hot food as well. I didn't get to try the food but everything looks great. I would probably return for breakfast."}
{"text":"I just had the best lunch I have ever had in a long time! I had the chicken pesto panini and The French onion soup. It was  so good! The service is outstanding  and the restaurant is so cute. I will definitely be back for some more yummy delicious food."}
{"text":"I came here one morning with my lady friend and had an absolutely riveting experience. The croque madame was fantastic and the classic breakfast sandwich was terrific. Both the food we ordered and lattes were neatly and very  aesthetically presented. Our server was much more than polite and friendly and our overall experience was truly five stars."}
{"text":"This place is a cute little cafe that's kind of hidden but should be known by everyone!!! This is my absolute favorite cafe. Their coffee is good, crepe is great, and their QUICHE!!!!! Omg it is AMAZING!!! By far the best quiche I've ever had in my life and no, I am not exaggerating lol. I like them soft, melts in your mouth and not too hard crust. Which is exactly how they make them!! Even though this place is just a cafe, their service is amazing! Every staff is nice and welcoming and they are all so informative!!! I can recommend this place to anyone without a doubt because I know they will not be disappointed. Definitely check this place out!!"}
{"text":"This was my first visit, very impressed! I had cafe latte and a chocolate croissant. Fresh and very European. The lady who greeted me and served the warm yummy croissant was happy and pleasant to talk to! I will definitely be back!!!! Love the French decor"}
{"text":"This place has the best quiche not just in Vegas but best quiche period. Love the cookies and pastries as well. This is my go to breakfast spot."}
{"text":"Went there on a nice warm afternoon recently. Interior is quite impressive, very french (although a bit dark, but nice). Seating is nice, love the European style little ceiling fans. Ordered an iced coffee and a slice of cake to share. That day it happened to be a nutella cake according to the girl working up front.  Customer service was decent; no complaints there. However, our \"Nutella\" cake, did not taste like Nutella at all. It tasted no different than a basic buttercream frosting chocolate cake from the local grocery store, quite disappointing. Will probably not be back."}
{"text":"I love this place!!  I was looking for a nice coffee house/ bakery near Ikea.  This had everything that I was hoping for.  A great atmosphere & super friendly staff!  We worked with Tiana and she was a true delight.  Beautiful from the inside out and so helpful and accommodating.  I loved the Mocah iced coffee that I ordered.  Half caf, almond milk and half the sugar.  It was perfect.  I love that they offer Soy, Coconut Milk and Almond Milk for those that don't want dairy.  Ambiance was great and they serve coffee and drinks in cute mason jars.  The pastries and baked goods looked delish and they have bakers that show up early every morning to bake everything FRESH and IN HOUSE.  I also got the Lemon, Chocolate and Strawberry French Macaroons. YUMMY.   We can't wait to go back and next time, I'm brining more friends.  THANK YOU to the owner, Emily for being a true light.  Kind, hard working and giving us a lovely place with great food and drink options."}
{"text":"What a hidden gem! I love Yelp because I discover places like this! Spent a week as a visitor at the hospital next door and this place was my go to. Very cute inside. Great ambience, customer service, and quality! I must say that I tried more than enough items here, haha. My favorites are the breakfast classic on a croissant (sooooo good), macarons (especially lemon), lemon sugar cookie, and coffee (both cold brew and lattes). I know, I know, don't judge, lol! Definetly stop by, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"This is the best cafe I have ever been to. I have had the crepes, quiche, panini, cookies, and cakes. I can't say enough good things about this adorable French style cafe and bakery. The chef is very talented and the owner was present and very attentive to all our needs. I will go back every time I'm in Las Vegas!!"}
{"text":"Cute decor and conveniently located near the medical complex.    While Wi-Fi is technically available, it is generally down or has no signal.  Noise level is at a minimal and the ambiance is relaxing.  Alternative milk options include: almond, soy, or coconut milk.  Staff are generally friendly, except for the owner.  She is not always polite and her mood permeates through the vibe or the cafe and the staff.  We have seen her lose her patience with guests who ask questions about the baked goods.  Speaking of baked goods, they run a lean shop here so lots of times the pastries on the menu are not actually in stock.  General cleaniness is good here, with some occasional misses of stains on tables, just request a wipe down or do it yourself with a wet napkin.  The condiments bar is always well stocked.  Compared to what is nearby, especially if you are serving as a ride for a patient or visiting someone, this is my preferred sit down spot."}
{"text":"Came here on a whim after work looking for a great, French baguette. They didn't disappoint! I'm glad they had baguettes left so late in the day to satisfy my craving! Friendly employees greeted me when I walked in, but it was a little awkward since I was the only customer inside. I'm sure they are much busier for breakfast and lunch! The restaurant looks very clean and well kept which is a big plus to me! Food was great as well and the wait for my togo order was reasonable! Would love to bring my girlfriend here to try some of the other pastries and sweets! Definitely adding this place to my frequent visit list since it's in my neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday morning for some breakfast crepes.  Located right off the 215 and Sunset, it is definitely a convenient location with ample parking.   I had the berries crepe and that was accompanied with homemade Chantilly cream.  It was probably one of the best Chantilly cream I've ever had and I've had plenty.  Unlike most, their Chantilly is airy but not too airy.  It's the perfect balance between the texture and substance. You'll have to try it to understand it.  They use fresh berries and a compote in the crepe.  Each bite with a dab of cream, and it was heavenly.  My companion had the ham and cheese crepe.  It came with a side of house salad.  The ham and cheese crepe was pretty good but I preferred my berries crepe.  The side salad was pretty amazing.  Just by looking at it, you'd think it's just some simple mixed green with diced tomatoes.  But upon further detailed examination, it had diced beets of different colors and bell peppers.  I think the dressing is homemade, too.    They don't have regular dripped coffee, which I guess is what to be expected at cafes such as this one.  My Americano was perfectly brewed and energized me the way I expect my coffee to.    Definitely give this place a try and I'll be back to try their pastries."}
{"text":"We were thinking authentic French Bakery here, but it's not.  If you're looking for one, go to Baguette Cafe.  Here, it's a super cute inspired French decor and cuisine.  My husband is French and he asked if the chef here was French.  They said they're not.  Their accent sounds British maybe?  I was able to go on their site and it states \"Inspired by France.\"    The staffs are friendly.  It was quite busy when we came in for late lunch on a Monday.  I would say we were there about 2-3PM.  We placed our order and sat down.  It took a while until we gotten our food.  We didn't get our food until 30-45 minutes afterwards.  It looked like there were only 3 staffs working.  I have to say, there isn't an urgency to get food out to people.  They're all super relaxed.  I would have to say, please speed up the service.  We did end up seeing there were a lot of takeout orders before us.  Must had been why the service was so slow.  But then I'm thinking how long does it take to basically warm up the quiche that's already pre-made and to slice a piece of bread and add some ham and cheese and toast it.  Slap on some side salad.  (Then again, service in France is like this, slow, no urgency whatsoever. LOL)    We ordered two Croque Monsieur, Quiche Lorraine, and Ham & Swiss Crepe.  The Corque Monsieur had a lot of flavor, wish it would be 2 pieces of bread and not only one.  It's a bit small dish.  The Quiche Lorraine was well done, we love the texture and the flavor of the dish.   The ham & swiss crepe was good, they do need a new recipe for the crepe itself.  It's a bit too plain and it was melting in with the ham and swiss.     We'll have to come back and try their pastries, possible faster service.   Don't come here when you're starving.  LOL"}
{"text":"Emily (the owner) was amazing! Coffee was really good! This place is super cute! You have to get the brownie  highly recommend coming to this spot!"}
{"text":"A truly delightful experience. Warm, friendly and attentive environment.   All staff members exceed expectations, leaving you eager to return.  Croissants are heavenly, as are brownies and cupcakes. Breakfast sandwich was equally satisfying.  The Americano coffee is the best I have ever enjoyed.  Ambiance is relaxing and inviting. Everyone on staff goes the extra mile to remember me and my wife and they show a genuine interest and gratitude for our business."}
{"text":"INCREDIBLE. Just incredible. We had a vegetarian quiche, breakfast classic sandwich on croissant and a berry crepe. Everything was fresh and delicious and the service was so friendly! My latte was perfect as well. I highly recommend this spot for breakfast, I brought my Dad and brother from out of town and it was a big hit. A great alternative to an ultra greasy typical American breakfast spot where you are hustled out the door as soon as you are finished. We felt free to relax and chat with no rush.  I will coming back soon."}
{"text":"Absolutely in love with this place! The berry crepe is amazing. The veggie panini is great. Love their desserts too. Def recommend it"}
{"text":"A nice place with a simple menu and straight forward fresh tasting ingredients. Absolutely LOVE the mixed berry crepe.   Large portion, so have an appetite when ordering.  Their French press is very tasty, I usually get it with foam milk.  Seating is a bit awkward but very pleasant on a nice day outside. Defiantly take a look at their sweets as well-  delicious."}
{"text":"Wow.  Seeing the five stars this place has inclined me to come in.   But, actually experiencing the five stars was something I was not expecting.  This place is quaint, quiet, and cute.  The food was amazing, the service was awesome, and the coffee was the bees knees.  I was embarrassed to bring my Starbucks in and felt inclined to purchase a latte from them, but I'm not disappointed.  Most definitely coming back."}
{"text":"I haven't even completely finished eating my lunch and I am writing this review. If I could give this place 10 stars I would.I don't think I have ever had a sandwich quite as delicious. I have ordered coffee from this place several times, and the almond croissant (which is delicious BTW), today I called and placed an order for the Turkey,Apple, Brie sandwich. They give you the option to get it on a baguette or croissant. Pick the croissant, its so flaky and tasty. The sandwich comes with a decent size slice of Brie, and the whole sandwich melts in your mouth. It also came with a side salad(which was also extremely tasty) and a slice of watermelon. In addition to the food being out of this world. The cafe is quaint, and has a very friendly environment. The staff is kind and helpful! If you also get a chance try the macaroons that they make, they are to die for. They also have WiFi access, which is great for all of the medical staff who work in the area. Sorry I don't have any photos, the food was so good, I dove in before I could snap a shot of how delicious it looked."}
{"text":"This eatery is adorable! I'm a quiche fan and the Quiche Lorraine did not disappoint. Great price for the portion, friendly staff, will be returning soon!"}
{"text":"I love anything that has to do with France and French cafes so initially I was excited to check this out. It's a nice open area with cute decor.   My friend and i shared the quiche Lorraine and a turkey, apple & Brie sandwich. They came with salads which just so happened to have ingredients that I don't like in a salad (beats, mushrooms & onions). Both items were a good lunch size. I also ordered a white chocolate latte that was good.   The thing that bothered me the most was that they don't play French music. The music sounded like normal cafe music so that didn't make sense to me.   Overall, it's a cute place to stop by if you're in the area. I wouldn't make the drive from Henderson to go back tho!"}
{"text":"Visited Le Petit Bakery for a birthday lunch and everything was so delicious! I will be coming back to try more food! The service was phenomenal and the place is so adorable. No debate visiting - just go!!!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Emily, the manager is extremely nice and amazing. The freshly squeezed limeade was great and the cake was divine! Definitely will be coming back"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Super cute café, amazing food cooked fresh and dessert was delicious. Top-notch service and friendly I definitely recommend this everybody and we're coming back!"}
{"text":"So, I really enjoy French bakeries and try not to turn down an invite to a cafe. I usually go to Maggie's Creperie or Patisserie Mannon as they are close by and I know the menu. So when I was invited here to Le Petit my friend said \"they have the best Quiche and I have to try.  So we ventured out, ordered Quiche Loraine which was had the norm, bacon, cheese and it was yummy, I have to say not the best but was creamy and good. I did only have 2 bites so I will try just quiche on another visit. We also ordered the Turkey, apple and Brie on a croissant and the French dip on baguette, both sandwiches came with a small side salad.  I ordered he turkey and my friend the French dip, we ended up exchanging through the meal as the Drench dip had so much flavor and was in my opinion the reason I will give this place another try.  The turkey sandwich was good but the pesto was only on half the sandwich and call me strange but I feel that spring mix should be in a salad not on a sandwich.  It just was good.  I don't know if it was a filling meal or I didn't enjoy it as much as I wanted as I only ate half of what I ordered. (I guess that could be a good thing ;))  The croissant it was made with was delicious  As per suggestions from other yelpers, we tried the salted caramel cookie which was Devine! A nice crunch and very tasty... it was a big cookie and I could only eat about half at a time but a nice little treat for later.  Will give it another try sometime and update from there  The atmosphere was fun and made you feel like you were in another French cafe...  and all other guests seemed very happy."}
{"text":"All smiles here !!! The baristas are super happy and excited to have you and love to greet you and have a conversation with you! I went in the last few hours before closure and it was  very quiet , perfect for getting your reading in !  I love supporting small businesses over humongous places like Starbucks any day !"}
{"text":"Items Selected: Almond Croissant Apple Turnover Salty Caramel Cookie Chocolate Chip Cookie Ginger Snap Peach Danish Strawberry Danish  Newly opened on Medical Center Street, two-doors down from Tipsy Coffee house with high ceilings and decorating that is best described as Paris-by-way-of-Ikea, le petit café & bakery looks to continue a recent trend of great baked goods on both sides of The Valley, a recent visit showing that the restaurant has a long way to go if they wish to compare favorably.  Visited early on Saturday, the doors already open with the manager, baker and two staff present at 8:40am, even though the internet seems to indicate they do not open until 9 o' clock on this day, it was to cheerful faces and pleasant service that the group greeted patrons from behind a countertop, items still rolling out of the oven as questions were addressed, words such as \"authentic\" seemingly misplaced for a case of outsourced Gelato flavors while a menu of desserts listed overhead were reported as \"not ready yet.\"  Finding a seat after placing the order, a total of $16.00 exchanged for seven tastes including a complimentary Ginger Snap, the choice to start with a pair of Danishes was made because the choices were still warm from the oven, the pocket of Strawberry tasting of good Jam juxtaposing Butter while the version described as Lemon was, in fact, Peach - and questionably the soggy sort straight from a can.  Moving on to the Turnover, described as \"Caramel Apple\" on the menu but more like Motts Applesauce in flavor with a bit more texture from diced Fruit, the Almond Croissant proved to be nothing short of disastrous, prompting one local Chef to ask \"Is that a Biscuit?\" when he saw a picture of it, the flavor thankfully natural though the lamination was poor while the whole thing certainly would have seen a bit of moisture as a benefit.  Ending on a high note, the Salty Caramel Cookie sort of like a Sugar Cookie with crunchy ribbons coursing through its crumb as large chunks of Dark Chocolate Chip riddled its counterpart, it was in noting that neither the Croissant nor the Turnover had been completed that the manager asked if a box was needed, a response that the former was far too dry leading to the suggestion that I might want a \"fresh one to-go\" leading to assumptions about what had actually been offered...and not much interest in making a return.  ** One year ago le petit café & bakery would have been another average choice amidst many substandard Bakeries in town, but with the launch of Rosallie on the West, CRAFTkitchen on the East as well as the improved quality elsewhere there is very little reason to visit this place when better can be found just a few minutes away."}
{"text":"The berry crepe was amazing!!!!! Fresh berries. Atmosphere was cute, loved the decor.  The reason for 4 stars versus 5 was because I wanted two crepes but they only have one crepe Pan and it takes 10 minutes per crepe. I didn't have time to wait 20 minutes for two crepes and if I hadn't shared my crepe as it is then one would have been cold."}
{"text":"Always a warm welcome from the pleasant staff here.  Quaint & cozy haunt with a lovely outdoor patio.   Le Petit is perfect for whether you're looking to settling in for a coffee and a bite or simply scoop up a quick caffeine fix this cafe is just right:)  Le Le Petit serves a nice French press, or a variety of espresso-based drinks, frothy or iced this cafe will soothe that caffeine crave. Each morning well Perhaps afternoon for some (insert an emoji) one will find a variety of pastries, cookies, etc. as well as the delicious variety of sandwiches and soups. These excellent pastries are made daily, and if you're lucky enough you may just see one creating them!  Le Petit has a variety of savory and flavorful menu items and the best way is to hurry in and try some!"}
{"text":"Great service and great pastries! I had a carrot cake , chocolate & apricot macaroons."}
{"text":"This café is just adorable. Lots of cute French-themed decór and a loungy vibe with a bright interior and both indoor and outdoor seating. You order at the counter and then they bring your order out to you. I came here for a work meeting, I had a sugar free vanilla iced coffee. It was standard but enjoyable, it came in a cute mug and I liked the crushed ice. 2 out of the 4 of us ordered sandwiches, and they actually came out before our drinks, which was odd. The drinks actually took surprisingly long, but we all ordered different things and I guess they really take their time here. The barista actually mentioned that they make their own lavender syrup in-house, so if that's something you're into then you should perhaps give it a try. This location isn't particularly convenient for me, but if I was in the area again I would stop by for a coffee or lunch."}
{"text":"Being an artist were always trying to find the perfect spot to relax, enjoy some coffee and work at the same time. Le Petit offers it all and so much more! I have tried many coffee places here in Vegas and this one by far has been my favorite, all the pastries and coffee are made fresh every day and the vibe inside this place is one of the best! This is definitely my go to spot every week!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went in for a light lunch and we shared the \"croque madame sandwich\" & the \"ham Swiss seasonal vegetables crepe\", soooooooo delicious I loved every bite! Highly recommend either on of those two dishes. And I couldn't leave with some sweets, the lavender shortbread cookies were to die for as well as their coconut coffee latte. Emily the owner and the chef Susie we're both there, they were so sweet!"}
{"text":"This place it the cutest! Coffee was amazing I got an iced americano with white mocha and coconut milk with a quiche Lorraine so yummy! Must try! Great place to start your Sunday :)"}
{"text":"Best chocolate cupcakes in Vegas (when they have them- different flavours all the time and I'm not much for vanilla cake.) Also they often have little mini creme brulees.  Great sandwiches. I favour the turkey & brie. Very good quiche, very custard-y, velvety.  Delicious fresh orange juice that tastes like Sunny-D, as only fresh orange juice does.  Lovely croissant, flaky not too flaky, buttery, ask for jam and butter if you like.  & They actually answer the phone, if you're wanting to call and check on pastries of the day."}
{"text":"Really cool place!  Vegetarian quiche was amazing!  Lavender shortbread or a croissant perfect with the French press or espresso"}
{"text":"Always the best place for coffee & fresh pastries! Customer service is excellent and very clean (which you rarely find these days). Convenient and close to the freeway."}
{"text":"Tried this place for breakfast, and I was not disappointed! It's a cute, clean cafe with great service! We got the roast beef au jus and chocolate croissant. The sandwich was good, but the chocolate croissant was AMAZING! I would definitely recommend trying it. They also have plain butter croissants and almond croissants. If you have diet restrictions, they do their best to accommodate them! Great place."}
{"text":"Their Almond Croissant is the best I've had so far in Las Vegas. The texture and taste(not too sweet) is perfect. I had the Turkey, Apple, & Brie Sandwich that was really good. Looks like they have a good selection of teas, which I want to try next time. The owner(I think she is), is super sweet and helpful!"}
{"text":"First time here, the wife wanted a coffee and decided not to go to Starbucks and check this place out. Ordered an iced vanilla latte. Tasted good and they didn't take too long to make. Place is clean and had a very French feel to it. The 2 girls working were nice and made us feel very welcomed. Will def come back again :)"}
{"text":"Best food! Fast service and friendly. Recommend this place to everyone!! New cafe so not as busy but again great food."}
{"text":"Been wanting to try this french inspired cafe/bakery.  The decor is cute inside.  The coffee was nothing special...a bit weak.  The croissant was rather expensive compared to other french bakeries I have tried.  The croissant was just okay.  Staff was friendly."}
{"text":"Cute little lunch spot with super friendly staff and very fresh food.  The best croissants I've ever had! Excellent coffee, pastries, and sandwiches! A must for a quick lunch."}
{"text":"If I were to sum the experience up in one word I would say: nice. The veggie pesto panini was nice and flavorful, filling enough but not too heavy. The latte was solid, not the best I have had but enjoyable. I was disappointed that outlets were scarce, but that was about the only setback. Definitely a place to check out."}
{"text":"You don't have to go to the Eiffel Tower on the Strip to get a taste of Paris.  This little cafe is set right off the 2-15W and Sunset, in a medical office plaza. It's right before Southern Hills Hospital.  My favorite item on the menu is their Croque Monsieur Sandwich which is ham and cheese (at least that's what I think, haha). They usually serve it on a baguette, BUT I asked if it could be done on a croissant and they happily obliged! I'm not sure if salad and a cantaloupe is served with all their meals, but their sandwiches do. This place also serves macarons and other French desserts.  As far as decor goes, this place had such a quaint and home-like vibe that reminded me of Paris so much. I started reminiscing about our recent trip to Europe.  I've definitely been back more than once and plan to keep it that way!   Merci Le Petite Cafe for the delicious food."}
{"text":"Loved this adorable little Café. It's Paris themed with a gorgeous couch and table seating area. There are seats outside with umbrellas. They serve coffee, pastries, crepes, salads and sandwiches. They even have soy milk for those nondairy people. I love their soy vanilla macchiato. I'd def go back! Great place to meet for coffee and chat."}
{"text":"Love this little coffee shop !!!! Very friendly and welcoming staff and the café has a nice relaxed vibe. Great selection of flavoured lattes and the cakes and pastries are truly delicious. On my last visit I had salted caramel cookies which were amazing. Will be back again very soon."}
{"text":"Don't let the bland office complex exterior and location fool you...La Petit Cafe is a cute little gem of a cafe and one of my fave lunch spots when I'm down by Spring Valley. I've had the quiche and crepe here, both of which are tasty and high quality. The quiche usually comes with a side salad and piece of fruit, which makes a nice lite lunch meal. The best thing here is the fresh squeezed OJ! What a treat :)   Overall, love the cute interior and the service is solid! Would recommend for lunch if you're by this spot!"}
{"text":"In being all about atmosphere, I have to rave that Emily, the owner of this bakery/coffee shop, has done a phenomenal job of creating the mood of a Parisian café! The music, the decor, the furnishings, all lend themselves beautifully to this place. I am looking forward to sampling the different food offerings, as I've seen the deliciousness that others have enjoyed! The chocolate mint tea is my new favorite, as much as I am a coffee lover. And the personality plus of the ladies working there is delightful! The location in the southwest part of Las Vegas makes this quite convenient as well for travelers of the 215 freeway in that area! Well done!"}
{"text":"Cute cafe with great service. Tasty treats and satisfying espresso made to perfection."}
{"text":"I love this place so much, which is great because it is right by my house. I usually order the same thing every time because it really is THAT good. I love whatever vegetarian quiche they are serving up (my faves are the asparagus mushroom and broccoli/cheddar/potato). Their matcha tea is made with real matcha, milk, and sweetened with a little bit of caramel. It is amazing! Last week when I was in, they were cutting a banana salted caramel cake. I decided to take a slice home and share it with the man after dinner. I figured I ought to try it and make sure it was okay, so after lunch I had a bite. Then another. Then before I knew it, my half was gone. Before he got home from work, his half was also gone and the evidence had been destroyed. I will definitely be going back for TWO slices next time they have that cake! Seriously, though, everything on the menu is good, so you really can't go wrong here."}
