{"text":"This was a regular lunch stop for my kids and I. To my chagrin, they have closed. I understand they'll continue operating the catering service, but the restaurant is no more.

To Angel and the rest of the staff, thank you for the great service. So long."}
{"text":"Food...ok is the best word to describe the food here. The garlic cheese bread, chicken alfredo pizza, and ice cream were all good. 

Ambiance....it was plain and clean.

Staff....very friendly and helpful.

Verdict....I have mixed feelings about this place. You will most likely never find a cheaper buffet but the food is just there, not good and not bad. If you have a limited budget and are very hungry then this might be the place for you."}
{"text":"Simple, but effective/efficient serving model. Everything was high quality and quite tasty. A real bargain!"}
{"text":"Update:  Fried chicken is no longer tasty.  Toppings are back to mediocre amount.  Sorry to see it degrading.

Management must have changed or the owners woke up and realized the pizza was not good.

My coworkers and I would at least twice a month for the last couple of years.  We noticed in the past month that the pizzas are now full of toppings and not skimpy anymore.  You used to be able to count how many pieces of pepperoni or sausage or even mushrooms were on the slices.  Now the pizzas are covered with generous portions.  We go once a week now.

The fried chicken is very similar to how I make mine at home.  I salt and pepper overnight and use flour before frying.  Same flavor and crispiness.

The salad bar is sufficient and stocked well.  It used to have a lot of old lettuce and half-filled toppings.  Now the worker keeps everything well stocked and clean.

Daily specials like enchiladas on Thursdays are good and so is the fish fry Fridays.

Good for you Pizza Buffet management.  We'll keep coming and tell everyone as long as you keep up the quality.  Suggestion:  Loyalty customer card!  Free lunch after a set amount of paid lunches.  Advertise in AZ Republic and have only one price for the bufffet."}
{"text":"First off I made a Yelp account just to review this place.-- HOW IN THE HECK DO YOU PEOPLE EAT THIS? I am utterly shocked that this place has tolerable reviews! Do you people even have taste buds or do you normally just eat trash? I guess compared to dumpster food you might think this place was good. Don't get me wrong the greeter was awesome, great customer service and sociable skills. But it's the food that matters, right? So let's get to it.. The pizza was down right AWFUL. My wife and I felt sick to our stomachs after eating a few slices. It was lunch hour on a Saturday and it was DEAD. 2 people were there and they were well into their 70's. The pizza was cold, cheese was hard, pepperoni's were burnt... We even got a few fresh slices (packed with this cheese that had a weird tint to it) It was a deep dish pepperoni pizza with pineapple.  I took one bite and the rubber martian cheese filled my mouth. It tasted like I was chewing silly putty that someone poured tomato paste from a can on it. Ci Ci's pizza tastes like a 5 star restaurant compared to this dump. We ate what we could tolerate and left within 20 minutes. (because we just spent close to 16 bucks on this crap and couldn't just bail without something) ---- LONG STORY SHORT. We wasted $15 and some change that we could have gone to Ci Ci's or Little Caesars with. Never going again. EVER.  I shiver at the thought of eating there again. Prison food sounds better than this crap."}
{"text":"This place does not even deserve a 1 star horrible service and they leave the food out sitting ALL day long"}
{"text":"SO and I went there to try out a new place since we've moved to the area. There were a few people there, so we had pretty good expectations of the food. We walked in, and immediately, you could see just a few slices of pizza laying under the heat lamp. Looking down the line, we saw soup, fried chicken, and a salad bar. At that point, we were really hungry, so we grabbed our dingy plates and started down the line. 


Grabbed a slice of pepperoni and jalapeño pizza, which looked repulsive. The jalapeño was dry, and the pepperoni was burnt. I have no clue how long it was sitting there. Looked at the other pizzas, and saw one with fried bits of something on there. I thought it was potato. IT WAS CHICKEN. rubber, dry, tasteless pieces of chicken. I was repulsed. The sauce was watery, the crust was wet and soggy. Took two bites and passed. 



Tried the fried chicken, which didn't look too bad. It was oily, and tasteless. The only thing you could Taste was the bland oil it was cooked in. Never coming back here again."}
{"text":"\"Pizza\" and \"Buffet\" are two words that are meant to go together.  For what you pay here, the food is good enough.  Great for families and large groups.  The staff is friendly and the service is good.  It's a great place to take kids.  The location is easy in, easy out.  Relaxed atmosphere."}
{"text":"Every time I go I leave happy, and full. You can request different forms of pizza. I usually get get a thin crust pepperoni, bacon, and mushrooms. Along with a taco pizza. It has a decent salad bar, and the buffet also includes deserts, spaghetti, fried chicken, and daily specials like fried fish, or tacos. I try and burn off some of the calories in the small arcade tucked away in the back of the restaurant."}
{"text":"I would definitely recommend The Pizza Buffet over Cici's.  I thought the pizza quality was much higher and the staff also made an effort to make a white pizza especially for me.  I realize that white pizzas are not too common, but was really happy to have that made for me.

They also offered some chicken, salads, and sides to round out the meal.  The food was fresh and tasty.  The buffet itself was about the same as normal meal at a fast food place, so if you want to pig out and get some good food at the same time, The Pizza Buffet is the place to go."}
{"text":"AWEFUL! The worst place I've ever been to....truly. Pizza was sitting out for a while. Other food presented had also been sitting around and was dry. Scary atmosphere. Had a coupon for the place (on my phone) and they were all confused because it wasn't printed out and they are supposed to accept either version. First they said they would accept it and then after we had eaten (a very bad meal), they came to us and said they couldn't accept it and that we would have to pay regular price for our meals. And the bathrooms were disgusting. It was just an overall terrible experience. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"So this place was pretty much a travesty. The price was definitely cheap which was nice. This however was the regular buffet not the \"X-Treme\" one for a dollar fifty more which adds access to some fried chicken and mashed potatos and gravy. 

The pizza wasn't terrible if you could get fresh slices. They had plenty of old dried out pizzas of various types that had been ignored for days probably. Every now and then they'd call out a new type when they put it out and a rush to get edible food began as half the restaurant lurches towards the buffet.  So once you happened to get a fresh slice of pizza it honestly wasn't terrible.  

They also had a \"dessert\" pizza that was pretty bland and kind of stale even though I supposedly got a fresh piece.  They had cinnamon rolls as well but I felt best not to chance it.

They've got a mini little game area with some arcade games and skee ball and the like, so they are definitely kid friendly.  Think of it as like a D rate Peter Piper.

Overall I'm only giving the place 2 stars because of the cheapness of the food if you happen to be able to get fresh food."}
{"text":"I've decided to write a review after eating at the pizza buffet a few times. I wasn't totally impressed the 1st couple times but have come to the conclusion that the food is good for the price. They will make whatever kind of pizza you want & they also have beans, rice some chicken soup, mashed potatoes, fried chicken, French fries a small salad bar and desserts. The times we have had the kids they love it and there is something for everyone. On Mondays & Tuesdays kids eat free so that makes it even better. There was a steady flow of people and the food was always kept fresh. All in all, it's good food for a great price!"}
{"text":"The food is horrible, cold, and old. I have never tasted worse pizza. There is barley any food on the buffet line, and what little there is is not worth eating. Worse restaurant experience I have ever had."}
{"text":"The floors were dirty.  You could tell the pizza had been sitting out to long. I went at dinner time and there was a whole 6 people there. I should have taken the hint by that. I won't go back."}
{"text":"This place is exactly what it sounds like, a buffet of pizza. They have your standard cheese, pepperoni, sausage, etc.. They also make a bunch of different kinds. When I was there they had a jalapeno beef pizza, which was pretty good. They also had Alfredo sauce style pizza. I am sure if there was a specific type that they would make it for you. They also have a section of salad and other stuff.

If you are looking for the best pizza in town, this is not it. It is an inexpensive buffet and the quality is pretty good for the price. If I had another hankering for multiple types of pizza at once I would go there again, but it will not be option 1 for pizza on a regular basis."}
{"text":"I really love this place, they have all kinds of pizza, and they will make you whatever kind you want just for you too, they have salad, some Mexican food, some American food, not to big not to small just big enough.  The staff is always very kind, courteous and helpful.  The prices are more than reasonable, you really should give this place a try."}
{"text":"The special item today (Friday) was fish, and and since I love fried fish I came here to give the place a try. The restaurant is spacious and clean and was not too busy when I came in, probably because it was around 1:30 and the lunch crowd was gone. There was a decent array of different pizzas, nothing exotic: white, pepperoni, veggie, ham & pineapple, etc. But beyond the pizza trays were the other dishes: yellow rice, beans, pasta, marinara sauce, corn, mashed 'taters, fried chicken, fried fish (the dish of the day, Friday), spicy chicken stew, desserts, and a small salad bar. 

I tried the veggie pizza and it was OK, and then went on to sample the other dishes. The rice was good, as were the pasta and marinara; the beans were a tad watery, though. In spite of that fact that it was that post-lunch time of early afternoon, these items were still fresh; they were replacing and replenishing the dishes frequently enough to avoid having dried-out food. The chicken stew was hearty and - thank goodness the server warned me beforehand - significantly spicy. The offerings of the salad bar were nice and fresh, though limited. But then you don't come here mainly for the salad, which is meant to be truly just a side for the main starches and proteins. And speaking of the proteins - for me, those were the best part! The fried chicken was juicy and the skin nice and crispy. I wish they had ketchup (I love that condiment), but actually the chicken was tasty and fresh enough to stand on its own. The mashed potatoes were an excellent creamy accompaniment to the chicken. And the fish -- yummm! It was perfect! It was deep-fried so of course some greasiness was unavoidable, but the batter was crispy with a light mouth feel -- unusual for deep-fried fish fillets -- and the fish itself was moist and tender. 

The desserts were freshly baked goods, such as brownies and cinnamon rolls; surprisingly I had room for the latter, even though I had already eaten a lot.

Certainly worth coming back to; you get your money's worth, and more. After all, the complete name of the establishment is The Pizza Buffet and Much Much More (for real ... see the pic)."}
{"text":"We visited after the restaurant reopened for summer renovations, and it was just as good as usual. I like it, but I maybe eat too much when I got there."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch.... and you get what you pay for.  It wasn't completely awful.  We came in hungry and left full but I don't think we will be a repeat patron.  

Off the bat the place is inexpensive.... definitely the most affordable buffet I've seen in a while.  However, the atmosphere isn't as great.  It's not as clean as I would have wanted... we opted for a table instead of a booth because the \"clean\" booths were sticky all over (seats, table, everything).  

Second observation: the smell.  I couldn't pin-point it.  Didn't know if it was the smell of uncleanliness or bad food.... until we noticed that they were cooking menudo.  Yucky yucky smell.

Third: Variety of pizza was initially poor.  I'm pretty much a vegetarian and there were no options for me.  Sausage pizza, pepperoni pizza, taco pizza (yes, taco), bacon pizza (um, ewww).  I thought that at a pizza restaurant a cheese pizza would have been easy to come by.  

You are, however, able to request pizzas which saved the experience.  They had a quick turnaround for fresh pizzas.... so I got a cheese pizza, veggie pizza, and spinach alfredo pizza.  They weren't to die for but you can't have high expectations when paying $5 for all you can eat.

Salad bar didn't have fresh salad.... everything was frozen.  And they got a little too creative for the dessert pizzas (strawberry glob with hershey syrup is no bueno).

All in all.... not awful but you definitely get what you pay for here."}
{"text":"Very good pizza buffet but quite a bit more also. Nice mid-sized salad bar with quite a few items. Additionally, spaghetti, fried chicken, vegetables, mashed potatoes & gravy, bread, nice desert items, and move. This is not the stylish fare of the big hotels, but for its moderate price is a terrific family buffet. They also solicit specific pizza configuration requests."}
{"text":"Hey let's face the facts, unless you are one of the people who seem to be insulated from the need for a recession style list of places to dine out.
This friendly discount destination \"The Pizza Buffet\" can both please the pallet and feed you till full for less many folks spend every morning on a Standard Premium Latte. Rand H and I enjoyed all we could eat for $5 and change. Thanks again Rand for introducing me to another location on the buffet bounty!"}
{"text":"3 kids and myself.. 14 bucks.. gotta love a Tuesday kids eat free. While I still had to buy two adults to get two kids free... totally worth it. 

The place was clean, service excellent. 

The pizza was looking pretty bad when we goth there but after eating some ok salad, the fresh ones rolled out and were great. 

Garlic cheese bread type
Pep, ham and jalapeno
Chicken wing

They were all great. 

Cinnamon Roll for dessert...yummy!

Really if you have not been here for a few years come back with an open attitude and a hunger to pack in some pizza, chicken, mashed taters, spaghetti, salad, dessert and of course pizza...any kind you want, they will try to make it."}
{"text":"Everyone knows I'm a Pizza addict....I can't resist it.  So, when I saw that there was an AYCE Pizza buffet nearby, I decided to pop in for lunch.

Priced at $6.49, it looked promising.  Unfortunately, it wasn't.  The restaurant looks like a cheap copy of CiCi's Pizza.  Not that CiCi's is quality Pizza, but it's heads and shoulders above.  I gave this place a good try though and pile up my plates high:
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ALouXcCfsrnbpNEpO9-Y3A?select=eV7eTP8eZq9WvH1TaZR6UA

The Pizza itself was about 3 Stars, but overall I gave the place 2 Stars because the selection of Pizza was pretty weak.  In the 30 minutes or so we were there for lunch, we didn't see very many options for Pizza.  At other Pizza buffets they pump out a variety of Pizza so you have a lot of choices.
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ALouXcCfsrnbpNEpO9-Y3A?select=qwYd_fU11hT-GT1gicfv0Q

They also have the option for other comfort foods like Fried Chicken, Biscuit's & Gravy, Beans, Mashed Potatoes:
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ALouXcCfsrnbpNEpO9-Y3A?select=M31XSvdMuVLEiZidKrxvSQ

I tried the Fried Chicken and it was just average.

Overall, not a stellar experience.

{"text":"pretty gross, you're typical quantity over quality buffet. most of the food was either flavorless or not fresh. i just picked and ate little of everything. when your hungover i guess its ok otherwise don't go and plz be nice to ur kids and not take them. far better buffets place like old country buffet."}
{"text":"My family stop by for dinner one Saturday night looking mostly to fill our hunger for some variety of pizza.  The Pizza Buffet met the pizza variety, and was much cheaper than I thought it would be.  I did think it could be a bit better if they had more of a desert selection, but the cinnamon pizza and rolls were good.  The restaurant its self is in need of a good cleaning and updating and the seating was worn and the most of the games in the arcade area were broken.  If you are looking for a quick quality pizza buffet at a low cost, this place is perfect.  My four year old was thrilled too, and so I can certainly see us making a return."}
{"text":"My 8 year old daughter has been dying to try this place out, so we went on 4/23 around 4:45 pm.  We ordered the kids buffet and the \"Extreme Buffet\", both craving pizza and fried chicken BIG time. 
The pizza was overly greasy, but okay for cheap pizza. The spaghetti noodles looked like they had been sitting there for quite a while, the gravy had a thick film on it and the mashed potatos were dry and crusty. The fried chicken was cold and the salad bar looked like it had been sitting for 3 days, the broccoli was brown on top. 
My daughter and I both agreed that the drinks were good, and went to eat elsewhere. 
I never expect much from buffet joints, but this place was much worse than any buffet that I have ever been to.
The staff was friendly, but sadly the food was old and unappetizing looking."}
{"text":"I went here about 8pm during the week.  I really wanted to try this place.  But, I was unable to even swallow the pizza.  Once it touched my lips I was disgusted.  I ended up leaving and eating elsewhere."}
{"text":"I give this place 4 stars for being a cheap, quick place to grab pizza, a salad and a few other random items that you'd find at a buffet.  

When you arrive and pay they ask what kind of pizza you would like to have made.  I recommend the all meats pizza, minus the chicken, along with peppers and onions.  This was so tasty!  Jalapeno and pineapple is a great combo too.  A friend of mine turned me on to it and though it seemed weird it was a nice mix of sweet and spicy.

Besides pizza they regularly have fried chicken, spaghetti, mashed potatoes and gravy, Mexican food items, freshly made cinnamon rolls and other desserts plus a decent salad bar.  Vanilla ice cream too.  Ask the pizza makers for chocolate sauce to go with your ice cream.

They feature a different food during weeknight dinners, like Taco Tuesday, enchiladas one day, etc.   Can't remember the items or days but it is nice that they mix it up.

Worth a visit for a super fast bite to eat.  $17 and some change for two adults at lunch, a little more for dinner.   We enjoy this little gem in our neighborhood."}
{"text":"I like this place because it's cheap.

The food isn't outstanding, but it's tasty enough.

We go fairly regularly because it's easy.

I'd recommend it."}
{"text":"Meh, it's alright.

Honestly, after a couple of slices, every pizza tastes the same. 

They do have a large variety though and on request, they can make a special pizza for you.

Overall, it's an ok place when you wanna spend about $7"}
{"text":"They have great fried chicken on the buffet. We use to like coming here but the last 2 times we have come we are there at the dinner hour, and there is like 1 slice of 5 different pizzas on the buffet and they spend their time trying to make it look like more. It looked like the same manager both times so maybe it's just an employee thing, I don't know. I hope they get it all figured out again, I'll give it one more shot in a few weeks just because I know what they can be."}

{"text":"Eating out with a toddler can be a real pain.  Take the sting out of spending over $6 on a kid's meal that your kid wont even eat and bring them to \"The Pizza Buffet, and Much, Much More.\"   They are sure to find something they will love here.  Kids eat free on Monday and Tuesday with a paid adult buffet and beverage!

I entered the restaurant with my almost two year old just before noon.  I was greeted by a cashier that was friendly and helpful.  Before we even hit the buffet line she offered to make us a our own custom pizza.  A custom pizza, for little ole me, moi?  It was a great way to start the meal.  While I waited for our custom pizza to bake we grabbed a plate and worked our way down the line.  At first, I was pretty disappointed.  There were 10 partial pizzas.  All of them looked like they had been sitting there since they opened the restaurant an hour before we arrived.  We grabbed a slice and continued to the \"Much, much, more\" section.  We passed on the mashed potatoes and gravy, they looked crusty.  The rice was delicious, the fried chicken was tasty, albeit a tad dry.  There was also barbecue chicken, but we didn't try it.  The salad bar had plenty of fresh veggies to offer and this is where my toddler did the most damage.  

As we sat down to enjoy our food and the first fresh pizza landed on the line.  Then another.  And another.  It was great!   When we returned to the buffet it was filled with piping hot pizzas...lots of them.  We threw down on a few slices and lots more cucumbers, then hit the road.  For a grand total of $7 and some change we were both stuffed silly."}
{"text":"Have been going to Pizza Buffet for several years. Place is located in Fry's Shopping Center at northeast corner of Bell Road and 32nd Street in Phoenix. Primary reason is take out, quality, selection, and price. I usually get 3 large pizzas to go. BBQ chicken and bacon; spinich alfredo with garlic crust; and jalapeno with bell pepper. All three for less than $20 plus tax. Good for many meals and hungry offspring."}
{"text":"They have reopened after remodeling. Same owner as before. Same super friendly staff. Good pizza and salad bar. I normally go for lunch, but they also have a dinner buffet. You can also just order pizza/wings etc to go. Plus they cater for private parties and provide school lunches for many charter schools."}
