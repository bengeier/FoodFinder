{"text":"Walked into an empty cafe, household kitchen equipment, terrace had mop buckets, garbage bins, a meat smoker,  orange juice press that serves hot orange juice, waiter needed a landscaping co. to shave his back, homemade bagels taste like a wet ball of dough, ordered a baked dish with chunks of Bologna and soggy lettuce strips, cups of water taste like they were washed with raw eggs, awful experience. Place needs an overhaul, Clean the place up, do something to hide your household kitchen equipment, don't handle my straw with your dirty hands, cut those bagels off the menu."}
{"text":"Cafe Botched - dirty terrace and lousy food, if your considering this place then keep looking.  Waste of time and money.  Try at your own risk."}
{"text":"My favourite place in the neighbourhood. I come here for lunch all the time. Run by the most welcoming German chef who's travelled the world cooking delicious meals. Wish it was open on Mondays and Tuesday. I always get the egg sandwich with homemade hotsause"}
{"text":"I had walked by this place many times as it's in my 'hood, but hadn't tried it until recently...my only regret is not going sooner! 

My boyfriend and I went for Sunday brunch I had the cocotte eggs, which they made vegetarian for me (bonus!) and he had a standard breakfast of eggs, homemade sausage, beans, creton, the works. 

Both portions were generous but not obscene, the side of fruit was fresh and they served us a sampling of homemade jam (strawberry/cranberry and strawberry/orange, both delightful). Breakfast included a glass of fresh orange juice...and I'm pretty sure my coffee refills were on the house as well. Touches like this really make a difference.

My cocotte, I have to say, was heavenly! Sweet (the roasted red pepper), savory (juicy portobello) creamy and so filling! I loved every bite! Comfort food with a side of gourmet, with a mix of European and Canadian favorites...what more can you ask for?

The staff are lovely, and the owner was happy to tell me that they are working on their terrace in the backyard, complete with a fountain and art! I simply cannot wait to go back and try all their handmade delicacies, while chilling on their terrace!"}
{"text":"Pretty good breakfast. Nothing particularly delicious but a yummy meal with a decent price. The potatoes are little crispy chip bites, very good. Bacon deliciously crispy. Some things seemed over-salted (like the sausage and the taters) but in general it was good. The owner is very friendly and helpful and really emits the 'neighbourly' vibe. I like that. I will be going back. Oh yeah!! They make homemade bagels that are delicious!!!!"}
{"text":"Wonderful service and Delicious food in this great neighbourhood! Thanks for the hospitality!"}
{"text":"After reading all the reviews on this place, had to try it. So, we decided to try it today!!  Love, love,  did I say Love it!
I had something simple scramble eggs,  ham and potatoes with the spicy a little sweet pesto sauce,  was so good. I recommend this place to all. I can't wait to go again,  next time brunch."}
{"text":"I had a standard breakfast - two eggs with ham and bacon, accompanied by some thinly sliced hashbrowns, assorted fruit, and a homemade plain bagel. Each of these components were fantastic, particularly the bacon (with a unique sweetness) and the delicious homemade bagel. My entire party of five enjoyed their meals as well, and noticed the quality of the bacon, bagels, and homemade hot sauce. The chef, Vulker, was excellent.

Our server Mario was funny, approachable, and knowledgable. You will certainly feel welcome if he serves you. The price was fair as well - our filling meals were all between 7 and 11 dollars. Overall this is the best breakfast I've eaten in Montreal, possibly eastern Canada. It was my friend Chris's birthday :)"}
{"text":"One of the best brunch place in town! It is cosy, welcoming and the food is very tasty, this place is amazing. It beats all the breakfast chains in town (e.g allo mon coco, eggspectation, etc.). The service is fantastic, worth to try!"}
{"text":"Amazing!!!! My wife and I came in for breakfast and enjoyed it all. Great service and I also like the fact that some of the items like the bagels and sausage are made in house. Will be back often."}
{"text":"Friendly and warm, this little cafe was a great way to start my first morning back in Montreal! Oh...the Benedict is delicious!"}
{"text":"i lived on the corner of bagel st-henri a year before noticing it! wish i new this spot sooner. It's a small quiet german bakery that does breakfast/brunch, and the food is amazing. there's a really nice terrasse in the back during summer, small and cute, it feels like a fancy montreal backyard. staff is great and authentic. I always go there to buy my bread and bagels now!"}
{"text":"We went in for just coffee. The server was very pleasant, telling us about their selection of german pastries and other baked goods. By the time the coffee came out she had successfully ups old us and we had decided to order breakfast!  And we were glad we did. Great food and great service. 

It's Sunday morning and we're waiting for them to open for round two..."}
{"text":"Cutest little gem in St Henri. Having just moved here a month ago, I'm so sad that I didn't discover this place sooner. If you're craving bagels, or just appreciate really amazing brunch, this is the place for you. 

  They have a different brunch menu every single week so make sure to check their Facebook for the updated menu. However, my staple for coming back are the bagels. They make the bagel right inside the shop so you know you're always getting the freshest stuff. 
** they also sell par-baked bagels (half baked), so you can buy them in advance in dozen or half dozen and pop them in the oven at home for 10 mins. perfectly soft and chewy, great for entertaining guests or all for yourself. My favorite are the all dressed and sesame, but did i mention they also have poutine bagels ?"}
{"text":"Was looking for a brunch place in Westmount/St-Henri, so I turned to my trusty Yelp app and it brought me to this place.

Located on a quiet section of St. Antoine Ouest, this unassuming little cafe really is a hidden gem. From the outside, it looks pretty small, with no more than 10 tables inside the cafe. However, there is a terrace, which is a popular option on nice days. On the day we went, the terrace was full (this was around 10:30 AM), so we stayed inside.

The brunch menu includes a wide range of egg dishes, from eggs-your-way + bacon/ham/sausage to omelettes, cocotte, huevos rancheros, and eggs benedict. The brunch dishes come with coffee, orange juice, thinly sliced breakfast potatoes, and your choice of bread (white/brown/bagel; for a small amount extra, you can sub gluten-free bread, english muffin, or croissant/pain au chocolat.) There are also sandwiches, salads, and baked goods.

I ordered one of the daily specials, which was a smoked sausage, spinach, and cheese omelette with the potatoes and a house made everything bagel. While I wasn't the biggest fan of the potatoes (I'm also not a potato person in general), the omelette and bagel were fantastic. The bagel was lightly sweet and had just the right amount of chew with a perfectly crispy crust. Yum.

Service was really friendly and quick. Both our server and the chef stopped by throughout the meal to see how we were enjoying our food, refill coffee, etc.

Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Good food.  Lousy sevice / hours of operation.  I live walking distance from this place, but almost every single time I want to eat there, they're always closed or have run out of food!  Feels more like a hobby than a legitimate business"}
{"text":"This cafe spot has the most amazing breakfast food ever.  Their food had just the right amount of spices and portion size was perfectly.  Coffee is amazing, strong and smooth with no bad after taste.  Everyone there are extremely friendly.  It's all about amazing food!  I'd go there every time I go to Montreal.  Can't go to Montreal without coming here!!!"}
{"text":"Great baking at this place! There is a German chef in charge and he bakes up a storm at this tiny hole in the wall breakfast/lunch spot in Westmount. With only a few choice seats inside and a small terrace (patio) out back I can imagine some days it could get crowded so go early if possible. I had a casserole type breakfast omelette served in a deep dish which was baked after being layered. The eggs were done perfectly and the sauce on top added richness to the potatoes and sausage chunks hiding underneath. A perfect dish if you're hungry. Topping it off I ordered a German brotchen which is a bun with a thin crunchy crust and melt-in-your mouth inside. Absolutely delicious! I've had them before but this chef knows how to make them come alive with your taste buds. If you are in the area do stop by. We found parking easily and walking around the street and into the alleys around the spot was fascinating and made for some great photography! Recommended."}
{"text":"Yummy! So much b√©arnaise everywhere! It's very good. I recommend the \"cocotte du jour\" or the \"croissant du chef\". Fresh and amazing food. Breakfast patatoes are a tiny bit salty, but everything is really good. They're also a bakery so you know everything is fresh."}
{"text":"The best breakfast sandwich I've ever had. The eggs are always cooked to perfection, and the homemade spicy sausage goes really well with them. And the bagels, oh the bagels..."}
{"text":"Where to start?
The homemade peameal bacon?
The ever changing specials?
The super friendly service?
The cute covered terrace in the back?
The upcoming Octoberfest awesomeness?

Ugh, I don't know, just go there and see for yourself."}
{"text":"I had this place on my \"to do\" list for a while now. I had something simple to start since I was headed to a dinner later that day. They do have specials for the weekend but because I didn't want to eat that much I opted for the breakfast sandwich. The beef salami was pretty tasty making it unique from other breakfast sandwiches.  My friend got us the mustard and if there's anything that's a must try, I'd say it would be their uniquely concocted mustards.  I thought that the food was good and the potatoes nice and crispy but wasn't the establishment I thought it was.  It's a bit cramped in terms of space and lacks the pizzazz of most other breakfast/brunch places.  My friend and I didn't sit there for long as it's more of a get your food and go type of place. They do have a mini counter for baked goods which do look inviting and fresh.  The wait staff are friendly and polite."}
{"text":"The service is fantastic and the chefs croissant is even better! I went with the whole family and they were so sweet to my one year old son."}
{"text":"Man, I wanted so badly to love this place. I've been exploring St-Henri and decided to try this place on a whim for lunch today. Feeling adventurous, I basically had breakfast for lunch! It's a cute, little inconspicuous place on St-Antoine street, close to the Home-Depot.

Since we got there at lunchtime, they had run out of croissants :( So I ordered the eggs benny plate but with beef salami instead of ham. Love that they have other meats apart from ham :) I barely got any house potatoes on my plate and the only texture I experienced was crunchy - where's the soft potato interior? Anyway, the menu didn't mention that the eggs would be sunny side-up instead of poached (typical in an eggs benny dish) so that was kind of disappointing. Apart from that, the flavours of the food were decent. I preferred what my friend ordered; the florentine omelette with beef salami.

The service was ok and their coffee was pretty bad. Would I return? Maybe to try their chocolate covered croissants but I'm not going to pay $18 for an ok breakfast when I can make better at home."}
{"text":"Really good, cute little place in St. Henri. Smaller inside that I thought it would be, but it wasn't too busy for a Saturday morning. Service was fast and friendly, the food was yummy with decent portions (the breakfast sausage was so tasty!). There's a small bakery section and after breakfast we took home a couple of pastries. For 2 ppl, it ended up around $50, which is a little pricey for brunch, if you ask me. But still, it was delicious."}
{"text":"Stupid good bagel sandwiches.  We got the deluxe with bacon and cheese.  Dine in and got more to go.   Don't miss this gem and staff are very friendly."}
{"text":"Visited there on a Saturday morning and tried their steak and egg with their poutine bagel. The steak and egg was on point but the poutine bagel was the bomb . The friendly waiter also recommended us to visit a popsicle shop in the neighborhood after our meal. Overall it was a pleasant experience to eat brunch here. Oh BTW they also have freshly squeezed orange juice"}
{"text":"Incredible club sandwich. Very genuine and friendly service. The back terrace is beautiful. This hole-in-the-wall was a very pleasant surprise."}
{"text":"What a delightful surprise! We were heading to Restaurant John and stopped off to see a friend at this tiny little gem. Since we were there (and it was too cold to go further) we decided to try out their brunch. I have two words for you - HOMEMADE SAUSAGE! Wow! YUM! Ask them about the special ingredient. The place is really tiny (25 seats or so) though so you may have to wait a moment. My companion raved about the bechamel sauce and insisted I mention it here. The portions were perfect and well presented. Service was very friendly and welcoming to boot. They also have a lunch menu including cheeseburgers and other delights with lactose free and/or bio cheese!!!! I am looking forward to going back"}
{"text":"This caf√© and restaurant near my house is a must. 
They have a huge selection of homemade breads, bagels, pretzels to eat there or to bring back home. 
Their everything bagel is the best one I've had in my life (and I'm from Montreal!)
They have a cute little terrasse in the back during the summer. The place sits 20 people inside I would say. 
They always have homemade specials on the weekend and there's always something to please everyone. Their homemade breakfast sausage is a crowd pleaser. Like you would even skip bacon for that shit. 
The breakfast casseroles are HUGE and so good, with seasonal veggies, meat, potatoes, eggs and cheese."}
{"text":"Excellent eggs Benedict. If you are really hungry order the skillet plate. Friendly staff, great service. German black tea!"}
{"text":"I will definitely be back. I gotta try that awesome B...i can't remember what he called it, but that almond honey pastry at the front cash. 

We happened upon this place after driving across town to Prince Arthur only to find our desired destination inexplicably (and irritatingly) closed. Whipped out trusty Yelp and had my friend search my bookmarks for brunch in St Henri. Place was not packed when we arrived at about 10am (a snowy Sunday). By the time we left the 20 seats were at over half capacity, not to mention the constant flow of walk-ins ordering to go. 

The authenticity scores this place it's rounded up 4 stars, but food portion-to-price ratio is not fabu here and so I feel this place is more 3.5 stars. Plus not ideal in winter temperatures, the place is so tiny that there's not much of an entrance and the make shift curtains do little to block the cold air from the constant opening of the door. *cold*

9$ for 1 egg with bacon, alright pricing...but portions of everything were tiny, my bacon was overcooked (but I forgot to ask for it soft so that's more my fault than theirs) and I had to pay extra to switch my toast to an everything bagel (0.50$ for a bagel barely as big as my index finger and I have tiny fingers, I feel that should've been a fair substitution without charge, for how tiny the plate was) and an extra 1.20$ for cream cheese seemed a bit jacked. My friends found their plates small in portion considering they each went with the 13$ specials, also paying for extras as well (bagel, cream cheese, extra pico de gallo, oj etc). 

The service was sweet and on point considering how busy they were. My friends stated at several moments if they had 1 extra employee to (wo)man the cash, allowing one to work the tables and the chef doin his thing, it woulda been a lot smoother. But they were extremely friendly and really provided very good service despite the rush. 

My friend also ordered croissants, chocolatines, another German dessert bar, and  over a dozen bagels to go lol. Everything tasted really good. The chef came and rang our bill to help out and was super pleasant and informative, but I was still half asleep. I'll hafta go back, just guna stick with the pastries, croissants and bagels. The brekkies are good but not quite the \"must have\" element of this spot."}
{"text":"One of my favourite breakfast place. The breakfast beagles are excellent quality served with home-made potatoes, simply a great way to start the day. Also the feel of this place is extremely cozy and nice. The terrasse is a must during summer."}
{"text":"This quaint little artisanal bakery offers breakfast and brunch options, as well as Breda, bagels and lots of pastries. I stopped by for a quick bite in a Saturday morning around 10 and was lucky to find a spot. The space is small with a few chairs and tables. The staff was super friendly and the waitress was real quick at getting our order. I ordered a simple breakfast sandwich \"the shebang\" with your choice of meat and bread. I went with the in-house baked brotchen with beef salami. The sandwich was delicious! Perfectly messy and filling, served with a side fruit. Nothing crazy of fancy about this spot; just a friendly neighbourhood store with strait forward breakfast and delicious food. I'd go back for more! Reason I'm giving four stars is simply cause the venue is way too cosy and too warm especially on a hot Saturday like the one we visited."}
{"text":"I can't believe I still haven't reviewed this place ! This is my absolute favorite breakfast place ! A true gem. The food and dishes are out of this world delicious ! They always come up with these amazing specials that are just irresistible ! Their potatoes are the best I've had - and the bagels are yum yum yum ! Besides the food - the ambiance is great and the lovely men that own the joint and work there are such warm, amazing loving people ! I love going there, they always manage to put a smile on my face and fill my belly up with deliciousness - this place is a must !"}
{"text":"The highest complement I can pay to a food oriented business was \"it made me decide against eating less food for no particular reason.\"  I pay that complement here.  

I won't have a better breakfast/lunch/breakfast food at non-breakfast time again in my life.  Jersey diners aren't even in the same league.  The same sport.  The same conference.  Nothing.  

Let's get one thing down pat first.  Okay, yes, first place I ate in Montreal.  Not used to proper French-oriented service.  Not used to proper French-oriented cuisine.  But one of the specials - a turkey, spinach and cheese omelet with garlic and onions had me sold.  

This with their homemade bread?  As in like four or five different OPTIONS of homemade bread?  

Oh my gosh.  As far as omelettes go, I've had far too few proper omelets where the eggs are wrapped around a filling.  THIS IS PROPER.  The eggs are fluffy, perfectly prepared.  The turkey and spinach were each seared enough to good flavorful things.  The garlic and onions, nicely caramelized,the cheese... oh, whatever cheese they used, so perfect, so wonderful. 

The potatoes?  Amazingly thinly sliced little quarters of home fries that were so crispy, salted with a nice coarse salt... oh, oh, OH so good it was.  

They asked what kind of bread I wanted.  I told them \"surprise me.\"  I got something whose name I forgot, but it was this little roll that was thickly crusty enough to need some teeth but not too thick to crack like hard dark rustic breads, doughy with a winey, tart aftertaste, and chewed so nicely.  I want to go back and eat their bread forever.  Which is good, because you can take it home with you!  

Nice guys run the place.  They didn't bother us, we probably could have sat there drinking coffee all afternoon.  Reasonable prices for what you get, located in a warehouse/dense urban residential district that looks like it's ripe for a populist workers' uprising, and I meant that as a complement!"}
{"text":"Nothing special about this place, it is a simple bakery with a nice staff. Nothing fancy or out of the ordinary, if you want to eat over there they make pretty decent sandwiches, but I would not recommend the coffee or the croissant. Their bread is good tho :)"}
{"text":"I decided to go this place because I needed something close to the metro station and I liked the reviews that were posted on Yelp. I honestly never imagined I would be so pleased. I normally don't give 5 stars the first time I visit a restaurant, but I am making an exception because this place is absolutely great. 
The owners go out of their way to be nice to you and you can really tell they love this place.
They also make different specials to keep everyone interested and coming back to try new things. 
They also try to cook everything themselves in the restaurant. That means even peameal bacon and their own sausages. Yeap, you read correctly! Homemade amazing sausages! There are also homemade bagels. They are a mix between Montreal and New York style and a must try!
I am glad we found this hidden gem. I intend to come back and also bring some friends. 
Delicious meals and great service is all you need for a perfect brunch!"}
{"text":"When you hear people talking about how awesome St. Henri is becoming, it has to do with the emergence of spots like this. 

A quaint little cafe down the road on St. Antoine, Cafe Baci's is as charming as its owners. And although the restaurant might be small, the food it serves up packs HUGE flavour. 

Apart from their standard brunch list, (eggs, open faced omelettes, pancakes?, meat, meat, meat...) it seems like they also have an evolving and ever changing list of specials. I went while these were World Cup inspired, and despite their tragic loss, went with the Brazil:  scrambled eggs with chorizo salami, some awesome bun type toast, pomme souffl√© (bonus points for this - they aren't easy to make), fruit salad, and yogurt topped with dulce de leche. For lack of better words: GOOOOOOOOOOL! And as if the food wasn't good enough, imagine my surprise when I got the bill and saw how reasonably priced everything was. Brunch like this anywhere else would have easily cost $20 or more. Oh, and where was this meal enjoyed? In the serenity of their backyard terrace, complete with a picturesque waterfall/fountain. Honestly, brunch doesn't get much better than this. 

P.S. You get a free cookie when you check-in!"}
{"text":"A lovely little spot, perfect place to go for a relaxed brunch. It just feels comfortable. The owners are hilarious and awesome. The homemade bagels are yummy. The daily specials are always something  new and exciting. The back terrasse in the summer is heavenly."}
{"text":"This is a very tiny place in a very unassuming location. However the food was excellent and the staff extremely friendly and helpful.... we're going to go back for sure.  Very child friendly as well our two year old loved her meal there."}
{"text":"C'est mon copain qui m'a fait d√©couvrir Baci's pour un bon brunch du dimanche. L'endroit est petit et donc on vous accueille rapidement et chaleureusement. Vous avez des questions par rapport au menu? On vous r√©pondra avec plaisir. √áa n'a rien de compliqu√© et c'est tr√®s simple comme endroit, mais puisque pas mal tout y est fait maison (les c√©r√©ales \"granola\", les confitures, etc.), c'est d√©-li-cieux! Je ne me souviens pas du nom exact de mon d√©jeuner, mais c'√©tait une ratatouille avec deux ¬úufs frits par-dessus puis de la cr√®me b√©arnaise dans un petit plat en fonte. Accompagn√© de patates, de fruits frais et de baguette, c'√©tait assez remplissant pour ne pas avoir faim avant l'heure du souper! Le caf√© √©tait bon, mais rien d'extraordinaire. Je n'ai qu'essay√© le caf√© filtre, donc la prochaine fois, j'essaierai probablement quelque chose de plus cors√©, surtout parce qu'ils offrent un biscuit gratuit en ce moment pour ceux qui font un check-in avec l'application Yelp! J'ai bien h√¢te de go√ªter √† leurs biscuits!"}
{"text":"My friend and I visited this cafe for breakfast on a Friday morning on a whim because we were looking for something nearby. And boy, we were in for a treat! We were so impressed that we came back the Sunday after, so we could also enjoy their weekend brunch options. Don't be discouraged because the place is a little further away. Plus, it is just minutes from metro St.-Henri!

Both times we were seated quickly and the waiter was very friendly and accommodating. When you read the menu it seems like your standard breakfast place, but once you get your plate you are in for a pleasant surprise! On the Sunday I ordered a \"Sandwich Oeuf Deluxe\" for which you could choose the bread, and I chose their home-made bagels. DE-LI-CIOUS! On the week end they also have specials, and my friend and I shared the lemon crepes. They were super thin and the lemon creme was just to die for. We also got a small complementary, fresh orange juice (yum!) and some fruit with our order! And on top of all of this deliciousness, the food was beautifully arranged, it makes you want to jump right in (see pictures).

They also have a small patio in the back (which we didn't use though) but it seems like a lovely place to have breakfast in the summer.

All in all, I can highly recommend this little gem, also because you pay very little money for the exceptional yumminess that you are getting.

I would say we would go back, but oh well, we already did. And we will continue to do so!"}
{"text":"Petit local, pratique si on reste dans le quartier, bon service , brunch correct mais pourrait etre plus economique .. le local manque de ventilaton, l'huile des fritures  est dans l'air."}
{"text":"This is, without a doubt, my favorite breakfast/brunch joint in St Henri.

I could speak volumes about the different and elaborate (but decently priced) breakfasts I've had here but it's far easier for me to just tell you that you need to eat here. Also, EVERYTHING is homemade.

Eat the everything bagel- it does things to you. *quivers*

Saying the service is good is an understatement given that with time the owners have made my partner, my friends and I feel like old friends coming over for a meal. Going to Baci's is like as if my parents miraculously both went to culinary school, lovingly remarried, and invited me over. No joke.

Word to the wise: call in advance to make sure there's room (it's pretty tiny) and the place is open."}
{"text":"Loved it. Great service so warm and welcoming.  Texmex was great!  Coffee was good as well! they have wifi and plugs which is so awesome for ppl like me that work on the go.  
Thy do get busy at 10ish -11ish so make reservations."}
