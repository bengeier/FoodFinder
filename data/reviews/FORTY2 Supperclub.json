{"text":"In my experience, the food is very tasty. Everyone in my party enjoyed their meal and the waiter was very helpful and accommodating about gluten-free requests.

Food service was quite slow seeing as we were the only 6 people in the restaurant.

Poor customer service as they never answer their phone for reservations or inquiries. The voicemail instructs you to leave a message and wait for a callback but the mailbox is always full..."}
{"text":"The one star is because the food was actually quite good and most of the wait and bar staff were pleasant enough.  The steak frites were very well done  (pun not intentional) - in a large group, they still asked how we wanted our steak done, and the portions were generous.  One particular staff member was especially sympathetic to our situation, which was appreciated.  Aside from that, there is not much else that is positive to say.  

A colleague of mine and myself organized a staff holiday party of approximately 50 people at Vogue Supperclub on a Thursday night.  The price and location were right, they could accommodate our group size and the venue itself had a warm and cozy feel which was perfect for our needs.  Weeks AFTER booking, we were told that another party for a beer company I won't name had been booked that would be taking place upstairs (we were in the basement), but that it would not begin until 10:30 and would not impact our group downstairs.  Clearly this second party was booked so they could make money (though the party upstairs was empty and playing terrible music), essentially ending ours immediately after dinner, which did not begin until after 8.  People were just being served dessert at 10pm when things came to somewhat of an abrupt end.  I could go on and on about how frustrated I was with this evening, but I'll give you the coles notes version:

The food service:  My dining mates had their starter salad 15 minutes before I had my soup.  I had my steak 30 minutes before they had their Cornish hen.  Most of us ate a cold dinner because we respectfully waited until everyone at the table had their food.  

Drinks:  when the main bartender was busy, someone I will assume was a waitress took drink orders.  Having ordered a vodka soda earlier for $8 (I was later told they doubled the price on drinks because we were a group booking) I was surprised when she told me that bar rails were $4 and a double would be $8, but obviously this seemed like a much better alternative so I went with it.  A few drinks later, I got clarification from the actual bartender that I had been charged the newly doubled price for all drinks - so $8 for a shot of JD, and $16 for a double.  After asking the bartender to correct this, he obliged without issue, but come on - get your act together.  If you're going to rip people off like this make sure everyone is on the same page.  I find it disturbing that for a venue that never seems to get too busy, based on previous reviews, would GOUGE a private booking who has brought the potential new business of over 50 people.  Instead of ever going back to enjoy another fun evening, as I had originally hoped would happen, I will now ensure I tell everyone I know to never go to this bar.  

The hostess:  could not think of a worse person to be the face and front line of a venue like this.  When I asked at 10pm why our music had been turned off, I was told the dj upstairs was doing a \"sound check\" for \"two minutes\", and that our music that we had brought would be turned back on.  When I asked to confirm it was just temporary, she responded with a very condescending \"it's just two minutes, as I said.\"  By 10:15 when there was still no music, and our guests began to leave, I become annoyed.  When I asked again, I was made to feel I was inconveniencing the hostess by the simple fact that I wanted to ask what the hell was going on upstairs.  She matter-of-factly responded that there must be some sort of an issue , with no apology, and again looked at me as though there was something wrong with me for asking.  Needless to say, our music never got turned back on and at 10:20 the dj upstairs was playing some sort of techno stuff that was certainly not suitable for our crowd (or any crowd for that matter).  I never received an apology from this hostess, who was allegedly the \"manager\" on site that night, a term I use loosely in this particular scenario.  Staff began to clean up, the rest of the guests took the cue and our party sadly ended much earlier than intended.  

Bottom line - I would never book another group event here again and do not recommend Vogue Supperclub unless your standards and expectations of professionalism and customer service are very low.  I would go so far as to say I would never go there again, for anything.  There are so many other great places with great management and customer service.  I just feel bad for the poor staff who have to work under such mediocrity, because it is really them who will suffer.  The kicker is at the end of the night, the hostess tried to placate my colleague with free shots, as if this would compensate for the disaster of an evening.  Insulting."}
{"text":"Crowd seemed very young, like barely legal and the venue was very small. A girlfriend and I gave it one hour to change our minds but we left soon after. Probably a good area to go if you're into a younger crowd..

Bathrooms were a total disaster, really nasty like they were never cleaned. On the lower level, close to what I would assume to be the kitchen, there were flies all over the walls. I don't know if they were dead or just chilling but the fact that it was close to where food is prepared is disgusting. 

This hasn't been a complete write-off as I only gave it an hour to impress me - but I am not in any rush to go back."}
{"text":"No Stars for this venue and the only thing this place has going for it is the resident Saturday Night DJ (DJ Glew, you need to find another venue, other clubs deserve your talent). Safety hazard = Stairs, Washrooms = Awkwardly Small, Dirty Upholstery = Questionable Food, and the Crowd thinks they are Up Scale but really just Up Tight Posers in training. This was truly a wasted Saturday night, this club is prime example as to why people would much rather party OUTSIDE of Toronto. Real \"Supperclubs\" are on King West/College St."}
{"text":"ZERO STARS (Negative If possible)

My friend bought prixe-fix menu vouchers for five people on Teambuy, and we came here for dinner on the last day before the vouchers expired. However, we only had four people, so asked the waitress if we can use the $25 value on the fifth voucher towards alcohol. She said no, but when we asked to speak to the manager (who was eating at a table close to us) she said she will check with him. Well, she didn't speak to the manager for what I can see, and came back 15-minutes later, denying our request again. 

For a Saturday night, this place is very empty. It was just our table and another table with the owner's friends. So, I couldn't fathom why on earth it took an hour before we had any food on our table. My seafood risotto was just horrid - extremely salty. Everyone at my table tried it and agreed that it wasn't edible. I called over another waiter, and this one apologized and took the risotto away. I was expecting for the chef to remake it and waited for another hour, when suddenly dessert was served.. 

At this point, I'm just super pissed off, not only because I'm still hungry, but because after my complaint, the waiter and the waitress avoided our table like we had the plague. When I finally waved down the same waiter, and asked where my risotto was, he said \"Oh, I thought you didn't want it\"... Of course, I didn't want it, but normally the restaurant would make you a fresh plate, am I correct? Then he said \"Yeah, you made THAT face when I asked if there was anything else I could do for you\".. seriously? he's commenting and making assumptions based on my facial expressions? Of course, I'm fuming by then.. what did he expect? Me to smile sarcastically back at him? 

I warn everyone to steer clear of this god awful place. Located in the middle of nowhere. By 10:30 on a Saturday night, nobody was at the club upstairs. Clearly, the owner has done nothing to improve people's opinion of this \"Supperclub\". The only people who frequent here are the owner and his friends. 

My time was totally wasted from 7:30-10:30PM.. the longest and most disappointing meal of my life."}
{"text":"I booked reservations here for 7:30p.m. Upon arrival I was standing there and was not greeted for almost 5 minutes. I had no idea what to do but stand there and wait. I was a little annoyed. 
As I was seated the menu was not available to me so I had to wait some more. Finally when I had ordered and received the food, I was very disappointed. 
I had the pork tender loin and my boyfriend had the steak frites. It was extremely disappointing. It was overloaded with the sweetest sauce ever and the frites were cold and soggy. 
When the bill came I had a dealfind voucher for $100. First, it was not a $50.00 menu as promised when it was a $40.00 menu given to me. There was also an 18% automatic gratuity on the bill. NO restaurants do that and i was so baffled especially when I tipped him $15 dollars myself not knowing tip was already on. The service was great but everything else was terrible. This restaurant has clearly shown that it's been cheating there customers and I will never come to this restaurant again. Poor management and and poor quality of food to even be charging $40.00."}
{"text":"Not being the club rat that I once was in my younger days, my familiarity with \"the scene\" in Toronto is slightly removed and I find the only times I now enter the maze in search of some \"cheese\" is for a friends birthday. Last night Vogue was the spot of choice.

Vogue is located in one of the many re-purposed warehouse/buildings of Liberty Village and only down the street from the soon to close Maro. Its a really cool space albeit small. The service and the club were top notch as far as clubs can go. I laid down my credit card to start up a tab and even with only one bartender working (which I thought to be a bit strange) each time I approached the bar I never had a problem ordering drinks or waiting for drinks. In fact I waited less time with one bartender than I have at other bars with 10-15 bartenders. 

They ran a tab all night and the server was super attentive to my orders without missing a beat. Kudos to her and I made sure to tip her well along with my personal thanks.

Couple points to be wary about here is that their prices are high even by Toronto standards ($10+ a drink), a bit bold for a place that clearly has not done the necessary work to promote itself (I had never heard of this place AND it was virtually empty with the exception of our 30-40 person group and a few other parties). 

Will I return to this place, likely not, but don't let me discourage you from trying it out. As I mentioned, I'm not a huge clubber anymore and the very few times I do make the journey out for this sort of night I feel this place will cease to exist (like so many clubs before it) by the time it comes around in my rotation again."}
{"text":"The worst club experience I ever had.
Went here for the New Years masquerade event, set up a booth ahead of time once arriving got no service or guidance to where our booth was, struggled to find any bottle girls to get the booth started, people were sitting in our reserved area when we had arrived, and numerous people left their belongings in our booth ontop of that which is why a lot of my friends (who paid money for the booth) lost THEIR belongings and when confronting the manager about this he was rude and said it wasn't his problem, will never go back here again and highly recommend no one does either. Management is trash and you will not be taken care of at all. Stay away, biggest waste of money and time"}
{"text":"Negative if possible. The only thing this place has going for it are some of the decor pieces. Other than that, this place doesn't even deserve to be open. Worst experience me + 11 others have had for a birthday dinner ever. We were the ONLY table - had a FIXED menu - arrived at 9 and only got served appetizers at 940 only to wait another hour for our main course which was EXTREMELY salty. We skipped out on dessert and just wanted to get out of there. Plus I think the waiter was high on drugs when he was serving us. Flailing his arms all over the place, had a bad attitude, kept touching his greasy hair then our glasses, and just overall sketchy.


Do yourself a favour and ** A V O I D  ** this place at all costs."}
{"text":"Bad service. Over priced and not worth the entrance fee. Staff are rude and unprofessional. Drinks are watered down and I will not be coming here again."}
{"text":"I was utterly unimpressed with this place. We had our work holiday party here. We arrived at 6:30 for dinner. Apps weren't brought out until about 8:30. Mains weren't brought out until around 10. Dessert wasn't served until 11. Well, I shouldn't say dessert was served. They kind of just laid a bunch of plates around the place and told us to go get it ourselves. When the courses were being served they came out of the kitchen so slowly that some people were done before others were even served. I had some spaghetti that was dressed with only butter and  garlic. Hardly worth the price. My friend next to me ordered a well done steak. It came out rare. She asked to have it redone. It came back rare. How do you screw up something that someone has told you to intentionally over cook? Anyway, at least there was booze to get me through. Kinda. Twice I walked to the bar and stood for several minutes while the bartender had her back turned to me texting on her phone. Servers had to leave the floor and come tell her she had customers. The coat check worker was also nasty and didn't say hello or thank you. The only thing this place has going for it is the decor. It is pretty sweet to look at. The food is below average. The service is about the worst I've ever seen. I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"1.5/5
Only been there for clubbing and wasn't the best experience ever.
It was actually extremely bored. Place itself is nice but bit too small to handle such a big crowd, and music was okay but not good enough to make people dance. 
Only thing save me from this place was the bar. Drinks were good and bartender was nice, fast and very approachable. 

I will probably not going to go back there for clubbing, but maybe will go there to check their food."}
{"text":"Two stars instead of one, because, conceivably, there are some people out there who might be into this kind of place.  For example, ladies, if you are looking for a Sex and the City -esque girls' night out at a place with lots of shiny chandeliers, this might be the place for you.  Gents, if you want to strut in your sport jacket and pointy shoes, you might also like this place.    

As for the food, I went with a groups of friends, so we were forced to get the pricey prix fixe menu.  The food was pretty mediocre, with *really* long waits between courses (even taking into account our big table and that it was a Saturday night).  The grand anti-finale was dessert:  a communal plate of cake slices dabbed with whipped cream with a few berries here and there.  And I don't mean \"cake\" as in Dufflet or even your 10th birthday, I mean \"cake\" as in French revolution \"let them eat cake\" slightly sweetened bread.  

By 10 PM the music was so loud that it was impossible to have a conversation with the person beside you.  I'm not exaggerating, and I swear I'm not a frumpy old man who just doesn't like loud music.

Despite the overall crappy experience, I have to say the interior of the place is well done, with plenty of exposed bricks and a good variety of seating options. 

We left before checking out the lounge/club on the upper level, but it sounded like a Richmond Street club transplanted into Liberty Village.  But it does seem to get packed, so I guess this place has its fans.  Just not me."}
{"text":"Renamed FORTY2 Supperclub .. nothing much has changed if I compare my experience to all these other negative reviews. I went to FORTY2 for a friend's birthday - possibly one of the worst nights. Bottle service was cheap for a Caribana night - $40 for entrance, booth and booze (per person). 

No crowd. Clearly, the club next to it was the popular one, because it actually had a line up. 
The little turnout was trashy - not my scene to be sliding down on the dance floor and booty shaking. 

I don't see why it's called a \"supper club\" .. The food isn't great and the place isn't upscale. 
The music was loud and obnoxious. They don't even have proper systems in place. 

Do young professionals even club anymore?
If I could've given this place ZERO STARS, I would've. This place gets a 1 star for the ample free parking around it."}
{"text":"Was in town, Aug 1, 2015 for Caribana. Came here for the special party, \" I remember\" HipHop and R & B. We were a group of 8, guys and gals. Got in no problem, got a table with bottles which came with a yummy appetizer plate, nice touch. The club is medium sized, clean space with a sexy lower level that never opened that night. The DJ was on point the whole night and had a full house. The crowd was chill, dressed nice and having a good time. Decor was simple and not visually disturbing as many toronto clubs were. The owner, Alphonso was cool, bottle girls were chill and not overwhelming as some could be. Wished they stayed open later than 2am, the music was that good. 
Only con, this location is out of the way. We took a car service to get here and worth it. I would come back."}
{"text":"Had a chance to party it up at FOURTY2 during my Caribana stay for an all white party.

First thing I immediately noticed was that the space is rather small. It's two levels, but you can easily reach capacity in about an hour after opening the doors. The venue gets the job done though. The music was good, the drinks were mixed well, bottle service was cheap, and you can swap levels if you're mood changes.

Can't comment on food."}
{"text":"quiet more relax part of town where the older crowd tend to lounge. The people working the front door were friendly. It's a really nice looking place inside with two floors (upper floor for club crowd & lower floor for dinner service and drinks) I didnt eat here but saw some people at the other table ordering steak dinners. the food presentation looked good to me. i really wanted steak afterwards.what this place clearly lacks is its service. you can't blame the 3 bartenders working a crowd of about 250 people with 1 guy doing bus service. but you can blame management for not scheduling enough people. ordering bottle service was like ordering bottles without the service part. just that one hiccup alone made for a bad experience that night. running back to the bar to get glasses and ice was terrible. But def would give them another shot if they enhance the service here. hire a couple extra wait staff on busy nights would fix this problem. its a nice spot outside the busy entertainment district and they have good value drink promotions if you're hosting corporate or birthday celerbrations."}
{"text":"I went here on a Friday night..and it was pretty darn good. $20 to get inside past guestlist hours (11:30), and with a long slow line to get in. I was utterly shocked that it was 12 midnite and yet the place was so ram crammed crowded that we weren't allowed to get up to the top floor until ppl left..1 by 1. So I wasn't happy that the first 40mins of me being there, I was just waiting in a line in the tastefully decorated downstairs floor. 

All that changed when I finally got upstairs. It was a big trendy dance floor with booths lined along the corners/windows, but damn it was so crammed, and the music was great dancehall/soca/lil hiphop, and everyone was dancing hard, including me.. A girl randomly asked me \"how yuh hot so\". It ended nicely at 3am.

I really got that Caribana vibes from this event, so I'll be back...I think it might be the 3rd saturday in every month.. and definitely try to be there like 11pm."}
