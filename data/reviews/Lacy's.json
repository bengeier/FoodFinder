{"text":"Every time I've been in here, the staff has been super nice and the food has been super good. I can personally vouch for the quality of the Polish sausage, the pulled pork, the rib tips, and the beef brisket; all of 'em are great and (of the equivalents I've had) better than Black Dog's. Service is also way better: food is prepared and served very quickly, everybody's really friendly, and the staff checks in frequently to see how the food is and if you need anything.

All in all, a great place, and each visit has been a more pleasant experience than any I've ever had at BD. As long as this little gem is in town, I won't be going anywhere else for my barbecue."}
{"text":"Read the article in the Gazette about the opening, so thought I would try it out.  When we arrived, the crowd was fairly sparse (about three groups dining, no line).  Considering I often wait 20+ minutes at Black Dog, this was a definite plus.  It's the kind of place where you order at the counter and the food is brought out to you, which I prefer for a place like this.

When I placed my order, I was informed that they were out of the burnt ends and the pulled chicken (my first two choices) along with a couple sides.  I opted for the brisket sandwich with a side of pit beans, as I feel this is a good barometer of a BBQ restaurant's overall quality.  The sandwich and single side cost me $10.90 (w/ tax, before tip) with no drink.  Not outrageous, but it's probably double what I would have paid at Porgy's and maybe even a little more than Black Dog.

The overall quality was fairly average.  The beef had good flavor, but was a little fatty and tough.  The BBQ sauce was very average and in short supply.  The beans were also pretty average. I will say that the amount of meat on the sandwich was very generous and I didn't walk away hungry by any means.  The customer service was great; friendly and quick.  Helped that not many other people were there.

Overall, I don't see how this place makes it in an already crowded marketplace for BBQ restaurants.  Black Dog, Po' Boy's, Porgy's, and even Hickory River are better options in my mind (sorry Smoky's) and are right around the corner. Even Chester's BBQ truck at Tumble Inn is probably a better bet.  Not sure how I can justify spending almost $11 on a sandwich and one side when Porgy's is probably better and 40% cheaper.   It doesn't even come close to Black Dog quality, which with a second location opening, is always my first choice.  Also, I am pretty sure they don't have booze (could be wrong about that, I got my order to go).  I hope they can pull it off, but I just don't see choosing this place again with so many better BBQ options available."}
{"text":"Excellent barbecue. Loved the ribs and rib tips. Try the pineapple slaw. Great beans and mac and cheese.  Downtown Urbana"}
{"text":"I was honestly not really impressed with Lacy's. After a recommendation from a southern transplant, I had high hopes. I was sorely disappointed. The sides are, like another reviewer stated, comparable to pre-made grocery store deli food. The sauce is sickly sweet, the meat just averagely prepared. Also, I asked if the coleslaw was vinegar or mayonnaise based and the owner kind of laughed at me and said 'IT'S COLE SLAW'. I was like, which KIND? Just answer the question, don't smart talk your customers."}
{"text":"We were just walking by when we decided to hop in for lunch. Amazing nice people and BBQ sauce is outstanding. Ribs melted in your mouth and gear home made potato salad. Owner stopped by our table to check on us and was so sweet!"}
{"text":"We just visited for the first time. Pleasantly surprised by live jazz on a Thursday night. Staff were very friendly. The food was good.  1/2 chicken platter was very moist but not much smoky flavor. Pulled pork was well seasoned but also not much smoke flavor. Greens, yams and Mac and cheese were also good. Like other reviewers, I've had better bbq in town but the music and friendly staff were nice touches. No beer for sale but you can BYOB, which we will do next time."}
{"text":"Funny, I had the exact same experience as the first reviewer, except my pulled pork sandwich was spectacular enough that I'm not docking Lacy's score for what amounts to (soft) opening day jitters. 

Smoked pork was great and in abundance, barely contained by the bun, while sauce was almost unnecessary as the meat was incredibly juicy and flavorful; sides were fine, standard smokehouse fare. 

Thrilled to have this additional BBQ option in downtown Urbana (we really have an embarrassment of riches in that regard). I'm looking forward to sampling more from their menu. I don't care if they've figured out the register or not."}
{"text":"Chicken was moist and delicious.  I have been there 3 times and each time they have been out of French fries.  For goodness sake take it off the menu, if you don't have them.  I would have given this place 5 stars, but I like my fries.  This place is so much better than Black Dog.  I just don't get it, I have been to Black Dog twice and each time the line was out the door and each time I couldn't eat the nasty food, had to give it to my dog.  I guess that's where their name comes into place."}
{"text":"Great service with a friendly atmosphere. I really wanted to like the food because the employees were so nice, but the brisket and pulled pork sandwiches were not tasty. The bread was soggy but the sauce was good. For the price I would expect a BBQ sandwich similar to black dog but it was nowhere near as delicious. Hopefully they improve and stick around because they seemed very nice."}
{"text":"Staff there were very friendly and answered the questions I had with no problem. I ordered the burnt ends sandwich and is was pretty ok! The sauce was really good! I'd give it a 3.

I went back and had a regular rib tips order. The portion was a little below average for me and I felt like the meat was tough. My partner on the other hand, LOVED it!

I'll try it again but no time soon."}
{"text":"I've been here and had Fish&chips (Friday special?) and rib tips. Both were nice, while I would not call it special. I liked this place mostly because the restaurant was quite, and the waiters (if I could call them waiters) were friendly."}
{"text":"Do not, ever go there if you're just thinking to grab a quick lunch during lunch break. Literally waited for more than an hour for a simple sandwich. And you would think they'd do something to make up for it, nope, literally just said \"well there's a lot of costumers.\" They weren't apologetic at all. And the food wasn't even good, I ordered beef brisket and it was extremely dry and hard to chew. Seriously with less waiting time you can have food that's 10 times better at black dog. Only go there if you want your day ruined."}
{"text":"Your standard good bbq place.  Urbana is lucky to have this place.
Menu is comprehensive but not spawling, a good sign that they are focused on what they do well.  The owners are bbq professionals with a colorful history.
Food was tasty and portions satisfactory.
Very nice interior.
Prices normal.
Wait-staff friendly, almost too much so."}
{"text":"I want to support this place...I do.  I had rib-tips with cranberry coleslaw and cornbread.  

Why I would go back:  great service!!!, great coleslaw!!, great bbq sauce. 

Why I wouldn't go back: the meat was fatty and tough...if the owner is reading this, I would really suggest marinating the meat for hours on end (it really makes a difference!). 
The rib tips were so fatty that we really got very little meat and were still hungry at the end of out meat.  (so we very shamelessly walked to BlackDog across the way for some brisket and burnt ends, really!).  We got 2 slices of bread, maybe french...that's it, no butter or some nice spread to go with it, good but nothing special.  

I'm really hoping this place is successful...I want to be supportive but like other reviewers, there is better bbq around BUT I WILL GO BACK FOR THAT COLESLAW!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Bbq is something I always need in my life. So that meant I made it my duty to try Lacy's. We ordered rib tips, fries, cornbread. The rib tips were heavy on the sauce, less smoky than I would like. Fries & cornbread were good but not outstanding."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff and delicious food. Lacy's is a welcome addition to downtown Urbana."}
{"text":"Delicious! Love the pulled pork sandwich! Great atmosphere, yummy food and the kindest owners. The barbecue is great and worth your time"}
{"text":"I am taking in to account that this eatery has recently opened. I know there's still logistical kinks to work out, so I will have to return again to review that. Right now this review is purely food and service based. 

I ordered the chicken and brisket 2 meat combo. The chicken was by far my favorite out of the two, but that doesn't mean the brisket was sub par in any way. 

The BBQ sauce was delish. I don't usually eat too much of the bread in order to keep room for meat. In this case I was eating the bread just to get more sauce after I had finished all my meat. Mind you, I'm barely 5ft tall and teetering over 100 lbs and cleared my combo plate. That's how good it was. 

The service was phenomenal. The staff constantly checked in on us to make sure we were satisfied.

The restaurant seats about 25 people and they do have take out."}
{"text":"Worst bbq experience ever. Owners came out. I know it was soft opening, but they had no chicken or pork. The ribs were so tough we couldn't eat them. The rub was good, but they ruined it with bbq on top of it. The turkey is lunchmeat with what trays like artificial smoke flavoring. All sides are canned or boxed and taste like it except they add a pineapple or cranberry . ... probably the worst bbq in the area you can have."}
{"text":"Came in with my folks for Mom's weekend hoping for a quick, informal BBQ lunch.

Lacey's is new to this Urbana location, they had previously moved from Champaign, according to the guy working the register. 

Unfortunately, this move put a few kinks in things. We wanted to order alcohol but were informed that the liquor license hasn't transferred over yet, so no alcohol was available despite being advertised. 

It was a pretty cold Mom's weekend and we were surprised that the inside of the restaurant wasn't much warmer than the outside. Not sure of they didn't turn the heat on or what, but by the time we got our food we were a little chilly and wished we had taken it to go.

Our friend working the register was very kind, but didn't seem to know how to properly work the register, saying his daughter who did went out to lunch a few minutes ago. He actually didn't charge us for our sides, seemingly by mistake.

The ordering process was a little hectic, but after we got our food we were a little more satisfied. I got the beef brisket sandwich with mac and cheese, my mom got the same except with candied yams and my father got the pulled pork tacos if I remember correctly. I personally didn't think my brisket was anything special, but my mom did like hers. The sauce was pretty tasty, it was sweet and spicy and reminded me of a Sweet Baby Ray's except better. We all agreed that the tacos were actually the best item on the table. I personally thought for $8.95 the portion was very small.

We all agreed Black Dog's BBQ was better in terms of taste, quality and portion size.

Still not a bad option."}
{"text":"Came here in a Saturday evening.  Had a bad feeling when i  walked in and saw only one diner on a Saturday evening.  I ordered a slab of ribs,  Cole slaw with pineapple,  potatoe salad,  baked beans and greens. Now i have to add i placed this order to go.  Service was good but when i received my order only two if the sides were there.  They corrected the order.  Now the food.  Ribs were very very undercooked.  Had to finish them in my own oven when i got home.  Is there a rub on these ribs?  Could not tell with the sloppy runny bbq sauce.  Average flavor.  Baked beans no big deal no spices to speak  of stood out.   Potato salad and greens were hit heavy with vinegar. ..one star.  And Cole slaw again too much vinegar.  Poor quality.  As a side note so much smoke hanging in the air my shirt the next day smelled very smokey. Will not be found back.  Too expensive and under average food."}
{"text":"I love eating at a new restaurant; Exploring the menu, asking questions, and recommending to friends. I was excited to hear Lacy's was getting an Urbana location. It was empty when I came in the early afternoon so I was greeted warmly at the counter and asked about the menu. After some small talk, I chose the rib tip  platter to go.  There was some confusion about payment and someone else's order, but I understand that is all new business hiccups. The service was fairly quick and staff was so friendly I'm sad to give them two stars. However, those stars are specifically for the food. I give some slack for my to go order being lukewarm since I had to go back to work and eat. The tips however were pretty dry and didn't have any seasoning. I tend to like my tips fatty so the sinewy alternative disappointed me. The side was a small cup of pineapple coleslaw, which essentially was regular cabbage slaw with pineapple chunks in it. The fries were actually good and what I expected. Steak fries make this meal just a little better. BBQ is pretty pricey so I never expect to spend less than $10 for anything I get. I really hope to try some other things and alter my review in the future. I want this place to do well and since it's only the beginning, so they have plenty of time! Here's hoping."}
{"text":"We came on opening day today. I had a feeling that it would be crazy so I insisted with the bf that we call in a take out order. We couldn't find the number anywhere online. All we could find was the old number which goes to voicemail. This was probably my biggest frustration. I felt that a business absolutely needs a publicized phone number in order to be successful. So we decided to go in and order take out. When we got there, I saw a huge line for the cash register with a bunch of employees  standing around in the back. After a good 20 minutes of waiting in line, the food took just a couple of minutes to come out. It seemed like they have a lot of kinks to work out. The cashier looked like she had never used a register before. In the end, the pulled pork was delicious and ridiculously juicy. The sides kind of tasted like something they'd serve at a grocery store deli counter. The mac and cheese noodles were over cooked and flavorless. The baked beans just tasted like the sugary stuff they sell in cans. I'll definitely wait to see how they figure things out before coming back."}
{"text":"Super good food and such nice people working here. One of the best BBQ sauces in town!"}
{"text":"Restaurant review
This is a super delayed review as I went during their first week of opening. Hopefully it's improved since then. When I first walked in there was no one in the restaurant and was happy I would get my food very quickly. It was clearly seen that it was their first week as a lady that took my order couldn't figure out how to input it into the register. They didn't have any of the rib options at that time so I settled for a pulled pork sandwich. The smoky flavor of the pulled pork can't match black dog and it lacked the coleslaw for the texture however you can put as much barbecue sauce as you want. Second my side was the mac & cheese the sort of tasted like something out of a box. This was a little bit of an disappointment as I thought it would give black dog to run for the money however maybe it's improved since I last went.

Pros: Super slow service, the pulled pork could use more smoky flavoring

Cons: During the first week of opening it seemed that they were completely prepared

Hidden deals:
None

{"text":"It's okay. Nothing spectacular.

I got the catfish sandwich.  It was good but I was unimpressed with the mac and cheese (looked like boxed stuff). 

The owner or chef walked around and asked how the food was.  Cool pictures on the wall.  I can't say much because it is pretty none descript.  The main portion of the meal is good, the sides aren't worth the money."}
{"text":"You call this BarB Q? The meat I had was pork- tasted like Beef and was NOT smoked at all! It was shredded pork-tender to be fair! I do not see this place lasting...they were out of 3 items including French Fries! Come on! How are you out of French Fries!! Plus it was expensive! 2 sandwiches and soft drinks $24.00!"}
