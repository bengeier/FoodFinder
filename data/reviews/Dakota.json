{"text":"Well after paying for a $18 dollars for a glass of wine you don't expect a PLASTIC glass. Come on !!!"}
{"text":"Went for Valentine's Day dinner and totally disappointed. We ordered steak tacos for appetizer, steak sandwich and steak salad. The steak on all three items was cold! It's like it had been sitting out for an hour before they served it. Flavors were bland and un-exciting. We could have easily made all three items at home for a weekday dinner."}
{"text":"Great brunch. Great decor. So friendly it makes you want to stay all day and night. Drinks were creative and fast. This is being added to my my list for every time I return. Did I mention the decor? Awesome find!"}
{"text":"My wife and I live in the area and are pleasantly surprised by how nice Dakota came out.  Contrary to the other nightlife spots in this area, Dakota has a great morning and daytime vibe.  The interior is crisp and clean yet inviting. 

Now the best part of our visit was the coffee.  The cappuccino was smooth, the milk and coffee seemed to blend perfectly and create and almost silky texture.  I can say it was the best cappuccino I have had in AZ.  We will definitely come back for breakfast and will likely try lunch as they have a no mayo Tuna Melt."}
{"text":"We so wanted to love this place.  Cool space, great menu, decent drink list, but, ultimately, if the food is just average it's not going to make it.  We shared a kale salad, had all the fix ins for a good salad, but they used the wrong kind of kale. It's hard to stomach, literally, a salad made of curly kale.  Dino kale is a much better choice for a \"kale\" salad.  I had the artichoke hearts which had an awesome crispy parmesan gremalota, but unfortunately the artichokes were blah.  No meat on them at all.  It could have been a contender.  My husband had the turkey meatball sliders.  Below average.  Seriously, who doesn't love Kings Hawaiian bread? But it takes more than that to make a great slider.  Would have been great if the chef had been a bit more creative, perhaps a teriaki meatball with some sort of mango chutney, instead it was just a boring turkey meatball.  Again, love the space but they are going to have to up the ante if they hope to stay in business."}
{"text":"I just ordered a Hennessy on the rocks and the bartender said $20. I asked him what the drink was because I knew damn well it couldn't have been a Hennessy on the rocks. He said, \"Hen on the rocks! What else would it be?\" I paid, them I asked my friend that bought our first round how much he paid for it. He said for two Hennessy's on the rocks, it was $33. I'm no mathematician, but I know that shit don't add up! Shady!


Response to Eric S. of Dakota: I never brought up what my friend paid with the bartender. At the time, I did not know how much my friend paid for the drinks. I did not ask him how much he paid until after I bought my drink. And even if I did, the amount wouldn't have been $12 because half of $33 is $16.50. I just told the bartender that I had never paid $20 for a single Hennessy on the rocks, and it was high. And we both paid cash, so I'm not sure how you pulled our receipts."}
{"text":"Went for dinner with friends tonight. The place itself looks great, loved the lighting and projections on walls. That is the only thing that we found we liked. The music was a little loud and played during the commercials on TV, it was good club music though. When game came back on they switched on the audio for TVs. This was so loud that we could not talk across the table or even to the person next to us without raising our voices. This would not be a place to sit down for a relaxed meal and enjoy the company of the people you are with. Staff were friendly and for the most part attentive although apologized a lot for things they did not yet have. 

We visited the website for the restaurant which is quite well done, the phone number listed though goes to a property management company that is not open on weekends. This number is on the website as well as on their facebook site. The menu on the website looked very good with a lot of options, once we got to the restaurant there was a limited menu. This was explained as they were trying some other options. The menu was so limiting as to have no appeal. Since they were trying out some options you would think they would come back and ask you what you that of them but this never occurred. There were salads but no appetizers. If you drink alcohol there were certainly options available. However, when ice tea was requested the response was the company they contract with had not delivered it so there was no ice tea yet. Certainly picking up a few bags of cold brew tea at a grocery store could solve this until vendor delivers. 

As to the food itself, the short ribs had good flavor however they were cold inside. There was an Navajo fry bread option that had lamb on it. The flavor of the lamb, although a tad bit salty was overall very good. The \"fry bread\" itself was inedible. It was nearly impossible to bite through and the taste was unpleasant. Of the three slightly bigger than silver dollar sized fry breads less than one of the actual bread parts was eaten. The meatballs were underwhelming and another ravioli/noodle dish looked so unappetizing as to not want to eat it. The Caesar salad was unremarkable and nothing about it wowed us. Portion sizes were small when based on price. The dishes almost seemed like appetizers rather than entrees

Hope this is just the issue that happens with a new opening and that they have success. It is concerning though if they have been open for less than two weeks and are already trying new menu options. The online menu was certainly appealing, the menu in the restaurant, had it been on line we never would have gone. Based on quantity and quality after we got done eating there we left and went out to eat. Do with the Dakota success however based on tonight they have a ways to go before they will be ready for primetime."}
{"text":"They did a great job with the limited space in main room and outside. Drinks prices are expensive. Mens bathroom small and had a line all night. COME on guys who designed that! Door men are cool. Took a while at times to get a drink. DJ both times I have gone have played terrible music. Hope it improves with time."}
{"text":"Was very  unsatisfied with the service at this location. Came with a few friends and upon reviewing our receipts noticed huge discrepancies between the charges that were being charged. The food was also subpar. I am sure that the atmosphere attracts a large number of the younger crowd after hours but I was not impressed."}
{"text":"Was here with several friends for a girls weekend.  Had a good time until two friends realized both their phones and one wallet were missing from their zipped purses.  Called the bar and was told, \"yeah, we have an ongoing problem with theft of wallets and phones.\"  Offered no assistance.  Seriously?  Be so, so careful here."}
{"text":"If I had an option to not even give them a star I would..... Absolutely the WORST service, cold food and they clearly don't understand the concept of customer service in this industry. Majority of our order was wrong and when they tried to \"correct\" the problems, they still didn't make it right. Majority of our group works in the industry and have a tolerance to this kind of thing but, we will never come back here again."}
{"text":"The drinks here are horribly small compared to all the other places on old town. Not to mention the bartender was rude and when i asked if there was any spirits in the drink, he told me if i asked anymore he would refuse me service! Of course, I am not giving him a tip! Not to mention this was the beginning of our night, way to kill the mood! I am not coming back here!"}
{"text":"Scam, scam, scam. Used to like this place, but no more: paid $14 off my debit card at the bar. Eventually got charged $26. Thank you, Dakota, never ever again."}
{"text":"Such a great place! Fun and friendly staff! Went and got a table there for my boyfriends birthday! The music was up beat and great the whole night! Our server \"Rachel\" was so sweet and fun! I don't have one bad things to say about Dakota!"}
{"text":"THIS PLACE IS NOT SAFE. I was there on a Friday night and realized my phone was missing. I realized it when I noticed my purse was open, and I had not opened it. I didn't want to jump to conclusions, so I started looking around for it. When I asked security for help, the first guy I talked to asked via radio if it had been found. He got no reply. When another security guy walked up, he shouted \"WE'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR IT ALL NIGHT, WE CAN'T FIND IT.\" I told him that's impossible because I just realized it was missing. He walked away, and the first guy I was talking to shrugged his shoulders and told me they had had 4 or 5 missing iPhone 6s. FOUR OR FIVE MISSING PHONES?!?!! That's not a coincidence, this place seems to have a problem on their hands. I will be calling today to let a manager know how this situation was handled by security. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"Warning: if you are asked fries or greens, say neither unless you want an unnecessary charge of $2 in addition to unnecessary charges, this place adds a 3% debit and credit charge!!! Food is too mediocre to pass these extra prices. 

Update to my review after the manager commented;
We were charged for fries with order of cheeseburgers and paid with a credit card and charge 3%, again food is to mediocre to be nickeled and dimed."}
{"text":"The staff is great and welcoming. Has a simple menu but the food is great. Very comfortable place to be at and the ambience is nice."}
{"text":"Only speaking to the nightclub scene - where's the talent?"}
{"text":"Wow, I'm usually not one to write a review but not to sure where to start with this place. We went there for Saturday morning brunch around 11am and what a disaster. It took them 15 minutes to say hi to us, 25 minutes to get water and when we finally ordered it took 30 mins to get the food, and when it came it was wrong..... Such a nice place but horrible management. Our waiter was a very nice guy but management had him taking care of all the tables while the bald manager chit chatted at the bar. They kept apologizing that they were short handed and people called in sick, the one guy said \"they must of been out to late\". Hopefully the owner sees this review and wakes up. The waiter gave us 20% off cause he new it was such a bad experience."}
{"text":"Our waiter was awesome, quick and always at our table to refresh drinks and to remove plates once we were done. It is a wee bit pricey for the entire family, but I loved the atmosphere and decorations. I love that you guys are walking distance from my home as well  :)  Thank you for a great experience."}
{"text":"Went to Dakota for lunch with a friend today and my first impression was good. The decor is cool urban and comfortable. Our server was nice and helped with menu decisions which was helpful. I ordered blackened fish tacos and my friend ordered a salad on the server's recommendation. Fish tacos not grilled or blackened but seemed sautéed. Don't get me wrong, they were very good but just wasn't what the menu described. Overall great experience and I felt that it was reasonably priced for lunch. I would definitely go back for lunch or happy hour!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a drink before a show across the street and it was still pretty early so the place was only about half full. 4 of us ordered 3 beers and a vodka-tonic. The beer came out completely flat, no bubbles, no foam, just flat. The tonic in the mixed drink was flat as well. All the drinks went back and 10 minutes later  we got new ones which weren't much better. The ladies split a salad which they said was good. The bill came and it was incorrect....charged us for the first round of drinks that went back. The decor was sharp but just too much wrong with the drinks and service to go back."}
{"text":"They charge a technology fee. I don't know what it was for, but it was a very unfortunate surprise at the end of a lovely meal. Why nickle and dime. I just looked. I was called a Processing Tech Fee of 3%. Very strange."}
{"text":"Went out last night in Old Town with my boyfriend and after bad service at Whiskey Row we decided to come here. It's a great spot with a great patio as well. Music was great and the bartender Jordan was AMAZING!! She definitely made up for the previous service I had. She is definitely not your typical caddy, stuck up bartender or girl...which fyi ladies there is nothing more unattractive than that (which I notice a lot of in Old Town) She was super nice, personable, sweet and funny!! Definitely go check this place out. Great service, music and vibe. Jordan definitely made me wanna go back."}
{"text":"What a wonderful place to come with friends great drinks not overpriced
 Naomi was our bartender for the night very friendly super fast service will be coming back"}
{"text":"The food here is AMAZING!! The Dakota burger is one of the best burgers I've ever had. The calamari is fresh and the aioli sauce served with it is on point. The French fries are the best fries I've ever had. The service was wonderful too!!"}
{"text":"It was pretty packed on both Friday and Saturday nights of my visit last week. They play a mix of house and hip hop, which is nice. Definitely a place to at least check out once during a night out!

Update: I had complained earlier that they charged me an extra $10 (that showed up on my bank account) after buying drinks. I contacted the bar and talked to the manager and he was very helpful. I still recommend keeping your receipts but I now feel more confident giving this place a better review!"}
{"text":"Great steak sandwich. 


Cool patio and live music. Took family and was concerned we couldn't be seated. But no issues. Try house vinaigrette dressing."}
{"text":"I love the decor and overall aesthetic of this place. The people working are nice and attentive once you get to ur table. However when we walked in no one greeted us or offered seating directions. The food is delicious! I had the Egg-cellent sandwich. Yum! And the potatoes had so much flavor. Super yum! And the cherry on top was that the coffee was rich and flavorful. I didn't have the heart to dock a full star just based on walking in, because EVERYTHING else was so good."}
{"text":"Nothing worse than having security give you a 5 second warning (no exaggeration) that you are sitting in a reserved space for a super bowl party.  We not only bought a bottle but several drinks and food on top of that. I could understand giving us a 5-10 minute warning that the table is reserved, but he was an absolute prick in the way he handled it. He told us to get up and close our tab at the bar/or find bar seating inside despite just ordering another round. Our server was extremely friendly and didn't even know the space was reserved. Security really needs to chill out. The lack of professionalism was baffling."}
{"text":"Great ambiance, absolutely love the decor, very inviting and comfortable. The layout is great and not awkward when it's crowded. Went on a Friday night, good crowd great group of people. 

They have a great brunch went on a Sunday and lots of TVs for game days! They have a DJ on Sunday's too . During the week they have a cute little coffee shop on the side for a quick coffee, pastry, and small snack that opens at 630 am. Great customer service easy to get a drink, definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"I came to Dakota for a Young Professionals Urban League mixer on a Wednesday.  The bar was clean and well lit.  The music was a little low...perhaps to promote more talking and not talking over the music.  So that was good...

Had two drinks and the bartender was nice and drinks were OK. I'd def go back to see how the place is for a game or other happy hour."}
{"text":"Went for dinner and drinks. Their food is terrible, point blank. I had the fish and chips and the fries were undercooked and still had the frozen consistency. The fish wasn't tasty, it was bland. Their cocktails are mediocre and for $15 it's not worth it. Staff there are very nice and their decor is beautiful."}
{"text":"Hands down the most classy establishment in Oldtown. I'm always running in to high profile locals and celebrities at Dakota. They're service is outstanding. Kay Lynn is an absolute angel and by far my favorite person to work with when I'm there."}
{"text":"Dakotas gets an A for aesthetics as well as music. Its a good place to either start or finish your night out.  I've come several times and have always had an enjoyable time.  The decor is gorgeous and there's only been a couple times (in my experiences) when the crowd was less than favorable.  

Overall, its a cool spot for a night out and It's also a really great place to come for brunch which many people aren't aware of.  My only constructive criticism is that the bathroom is small so there's always a long time and it always seems to take a really long time when trying to close out your tab. Other than that, all is good."}
{"text":"The food was excellent. Stopped in for Sunday Brunch and it was fabulous!  The bartender was super nice and had eyes for every client. No one was in need of anything. She was alone behind the bar on a busy Sunday. If you get the chance, you should stop in and see Desiree!"}
{"text":"Drinks are super weak. No need for fire on the patio in the summer either. They could do better for a new bar."}
{"text":"Best food on the Old Town strip...really good brunch deals too. Good vibes - perfect place to have a couple drinks whether it's a Tuesday evening or a Friday night. Highly recommend Dakota to anybody!"}
{"text":"Probably the best breakfast i have ever had. I wish i was hungover so i could have enjoyed it more. I got the \"short rib hash\" and the \"egg bowl\".. Both amazing and their coffee.. omg! I will return!!"}
{"text":"I had very enjoyable lunch at Dakota. The meal I ordered was fish and chips. It was three nice pieces of fish served on top of a mound of their french fries that are tossed with fresh rosemary, which is a very nice touch. I sat at the bar and Sarah(the bartender) was quite pleasant and made my experience very enjoyable. I will be back again. I would recommend for a nice lunch place."}
{"text":"Highly recommend for night out clubbing. Music was great and when my friend and I had a bit too much Zack and J took care of Uber and made sure we are safe. I was very impressed. Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"This place really hits all the bases.  Perfect for dinner with clients or drinks with friends.  Food is great.  The kale salad and the short rib are some of my favorites.  The ambiance is perfect during the day and switches to an upscale night club which I equally enjoy.  If you are in old town and want something I step up from the rest I would certainly recommend Dakota!!"}
{"text":"I travel to Scottsdale from time to time both business and pleasure.  When I'm in town one of my fav places is Dakota. It's a restaurant/lounge/club with a fresh look that plays great music. After 10pm, it always draws the best crowd in town with a great girl-guy ratio. It's totally worth booking table service in advance - directly or through becomeexclusive.com. The team working at this venue, led by Taylor Black, is better than anywhere I've seen. They're attentive, good-humored, and gorgeous. Can't wait to go back soon!"}
{"text":"I'm sitting at bar waiting on my food and in walks a lady with two dogs. She proceeds to sit at the bar and places one of the dogs on her seat while the other dog is laying at her feet. I overhear what I think is a manager asking the bar tender about the dogs. Yet nothing is said to the lady. Seriously this is a health code violation! Not to mention just because I don't complain doesn't mean that it doesn't bother me. I will not be back. If they will let a dog sit at the bar who knows what else is overlooked."}
{"text":"My friend Rachel and I came for lunch on a random Tuesday and the place was pretty empty. I always feel like Old Town looks so tired during the day, like it's nursing a massive hangover from the night before. We wanted to make the most of the gorgeous weather lately and opted to sit on the patio. As we had already stopped by Sprinkles on the way there, this was definitely a lost diet day. We split an order of the nacho fries, which were sooo gluttonous. The fries were perfectly cooked, and smothered with cheese sauce, pico, and guac. The portion size was pretty small for $10, but that probably worked out in our favor because we could've demolished an entire platter. I went with the Dakota bowl for lunch, and I think it knocks Chopshop bowls out of the park! The base was brown rice and quinoa, and it came with super tender marinated skirt steak AND grilled chicken, grilled peppers, broccolini, avocado, and one of the best chimichurri sauces I've ever had! It was super fresh and tasty, and had a little bit of a kick. The serving size was definitely enough for two meals, and I love that our awesome server brought Sriracha without me even having to ask. Rach had the roasted turkey sandwich, which she thought was just okay. She wasn't crazy about the aioli that came on the sandwich. They also had a Groupon available, which was a huge plus. My only complaint was that their cocktails were priced at $15, which seems a little high given that most of their lunch items are less than that. Service was super quick and friendly; I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The staffs are really nice and friendly, the food is soooo good!

I had the chicken panini and steak salad and both were very yummy! I also tried the chicken shawarma and it was delicious!! 

Try all three!!

This place deserves more stars! Definitely coming back soon!"}
{"text":"My wife and I haven't really explored Dakota late at night, but for dinner, this place is WAY better than you'd expect.

Service is excellent, from the Hostesses to the Servers.  Not to mention they often have discounts on sites like Groupon and Restaurant.com, so the price is right.

For dinner, I've tried the Steak & Frites and the Mixed Grill.  Both are excellent.  My wife and I have also tried a few of the Salads and really enjoyed those, too.  

They have a really cool patio for when it's nice out, and great indoor seating with lots of TVs as well.  I would really recommend giving Dakota a try, not just for a fun night out, but for dinner, too!

ENJOY!"}
{"text":"Nice place, kind of overpriced for lunch, but I think it would be fun at night. I decided to check it out for lunch recently and ended up sitting at the bar and having a club sandwich and a coke. The bartender was nice, but definitely not chatty. However, from seeing pictures of the \"Kota Kittens\" on Instagram, I'm not sure they are hired for their personalities. (Remember that episode of Seinfeld where Elaine starts noticing the commonalities of the waitresses at the diner? Yeah, it's like that.)

I will say that the décor was nice and the seats at the bar are among the most comfortable I have ever tried. Again, at night I'd think this place would be a lot of fun, but also pretty expensive. It seems like the type of place you'd want to bring a lot of cash and get bottle service if you really want to do it the right way. But hey, it's Scottsdale and if you're staying at the W or out for a special occasion why not do it up?"}
{"text":"This is a nice place. I really don't like the whole club scene, typically because it's loud and superficial. However, I've been to this place a few times over the last couple months and have had a really good time. 

Got a table here a few times, and the service was great each time. Even when we weren't trying to drop a ton of money, the bartenders are quick and friendly. The atmosphere is more my speed. More laid back, not as loud, but still a good place to have a good time with friends. 

Haven't been here for a meal, but I've seen some good looking food when I walk by in the afternoon. 

Dakota is definitely one of my favorite clubs in Old Town."}
{"text":"Sweet! I get to be Dakota's 100th review, I'm honoured! Well at least for now...

I had the pleasure of eating at Dakota twice during my stay in Scottsdale, the first time was on the day I first arrived and the hotel staff at the Aloft recommended it for a healthy lunch. When I arrived it was empty so I saddled up and took a seat at the bar. The bartender was super nice and I could tell he was bummed that I wasn't drinking. But he made some solid reccos and I ended up going with the Kale salad. 

The Kale salad was EXCELLENT, for only $11 a massive pile of green kale leaves were tossed with romaine lettuce, golden raisins, toasted almonds, quinoa, parmesan cheese with shallots and a lemon vinegarette dressing. It was hearty/filling, light and fresh (plus once I added grilled chicken it totally helped me to hit all my macros perfectly). 10/10

A couple of days later our group returned after having filled out an order in advance so the food would all arrive at the same time. For this meal, I went with the Steak sandwich and made the silly un-health-conscious mistake of ordering the rosemary fries in place of the salad I should've ordered. I imagine this sandwich is usually quite good but ordered in a group setting it fell flat. The bun was soggy the steak inside luke warm. The flavours were all there but this little sandy had been left out in the cold a bit too long and had gotten rather sickly. The fries were ridiculous, but how can you go wrong with garlic and herb covered fries really. Overall this dish fell a little flat based on its end execution - I mean fries shouldn't have to be the saviours of the dish. 6/10

Dakota is a massive space, almost too big to be a restaurant, but seeing as it's a hot night spot in the evenings it all makes sense - although I didn't get to experience the nighttime shenanigans! 

Overall a 4/5, their food is definitely made with love, the group of 20+ just hurt the execution this time around

Eatcrest Out!"}
{"text":"Service in Old Town Scottsdale, Arizona in general is bad, so is Dakota. A group of 7 we went in for lunch at 11:30, the restaurant was almost empty. They sat us down and handed the menu and walked away for at least 20 min. One of us had to get up and let them know we were ready to order. Took them another 30 minutes for the food. And 20 minutes for us to finish paying. Food was mediocre, not a lot of choices. They only have a salad menu and some sandwich choices. The steak salad and quinoa salad are probably one of the better ones. Ambience is great, the place is bright and beautifully decorated. But I'd say service is way too slow and not good for someone or a group if you're in a hurry."}
{"text":"I will not return to this place. They are stuck up and rude. Wouldn't even serve myself and my friends for being \"belligerent\" when we clearly are not (at 6:30p- AND I'm sober enough to write this coherently). I guess they aren't worried about sales if they will turn down a group of people (who are simply out to have a drink to celebrate) with only a handful of customers sitting in their bar. If they want to discriminate, that's fine. I will tell everyone I know not to go there for a drink."}
{"text":"Only had a few drinks here before, but never tried the food until recently. The braised beef tacos were about seven bucks for two - ala carte style - and they received only average reviews. My chicken Pannini was way better as it is a bar favorite according to bartender. This sandwich had some good elements including guac and a tomato spread on decent bread. The fries were made non-garlic for me and were hot and decent. This is basically a good place to pick up women also if your young. We saw some dude at the bar easily grab the number of a redhead and it was only 8pm or so - good job by him."}
{"text":"We were recommended by several people to come to Dakota. For a Saturday it was not as packed as most bars nearby but still a good crowd. You can dance on the dance floor or have a seat outside on the patio. A little odd the walls in the girls restroom shake from all the bass when there's no speakers along the other side of the wall. Dakota is a good alternative if you don't want it to be too crowded."}
{"text":"Very cool new spot in the Old Town Scottsdale area by Maya. Was surprised when this opened because there was no hoop-la on FaceBook or Instagram however it was totally packed the first two nights it was open. Awesome atmosphere! I haven't been for the food yet but according to new times they will serve breakfast and lunch, even dinner until about 11pm when it turns into a bar / club."}
{"text":"4 stars only for the awesome patio.  Gotta say the patio is pretty awesome.  But the service was terrible and waitress was miserable.  Guess we weren't cool enough to fit In with the elite Scottsdale crowd ?..."}
{"text":"For context, I was here on a Friday night so it was in club mode not restaurant mode. We were two ladies and there was no cover charge. The crowd was not mixed and mainly in their 30's. There isn't much place to dance since it's a very small place but it's absolutely gorgeous. The light and image projections were pretty dark and gothic and the place is like a mini white mansion, so it's beautiful. :)"}
{"text":"This place has a nice vibe and ambiance to it. I was with a big group and our waitress was really good and able to handle everyone.

I ordered the chicken wings and fries because I wanted to keep it light and simple. Needless to say, my food was far from simple. I just wanted some regular wings and they were a bit on the fancy side. Maybe I was thinking of  a BBW or Hooters (something along those line. Any who, they came with a smokey bbq sauce that wasn't that good. I ended up asking for some ranch dressing and that pretty much enhanced the wings. 

The fries were a totally different story! Again, I just wanted some regular fries. I guess these were baked in the oven which was fine. However, they looked almost \"well done\" and some were soggy and others were crunchy. I dipped them in my ranch sauce too (that's how good the ranch was). After eating, I got my bill and these nasty fries were $5!!!!!! That's the most that I've ever paid for just some fries, even when I've gone to a regular restaurant. 

Overall, it was a nice restaurant despite my rant over the meal. It was definitely not what I expected, but I would try this place again. Next time I will order something different off of the menu. I also liked the fact that we didn't have to ask for refills on water. The waiter automatically came to our table with pitchers of water. One of the other guest I was with had the french toast and it looked really good! Also, it's good that they have tv's all around for us sports fans."}
{"text":"They have limited options for drinks, appetizers and main course. First time I was there at weekend with couple of friends for dinner but kitchen closed by 9:00 pm. Second time was lunch during the week which they offered us such a careless service and it took them a couple of times try to make our bills right."}
{"text":"Food & drinks were very pricey.  Tasty though.  Friday night was A LOT of fun!!!"}
{"text":"I popped in here for a lunch meeting will colleagues and LOVED the decor/vibe of the place! They weren't very busy at all so service was quick and attentive. I ordered a cup of soup and the Chopped Salad + avocado and the salad was delicious! The shaved turkey was unique and the ingredients tasted fresh. It was the perfect, light & healthy lunch! The Soup of the Day was a curry chicken and it was ok, not great. It was a little too sweet for my liking! Since it is near the office, I will probably be back soon."}
{"text":"From morning drinking to a balls out phenomenal coffee shop attached to it to the night club scene at night, this place is amazing and picturesque. It's amazing no matter what time of day it is. My one complaint is lack of parking as it's physically situated off a side street. Attached like previously said is a coffee shop owned by the Dakota called The Comoncy. The coffee is really epic and the also offer organic produce,food and organic coffee. The staff is always friendly and outgoing. If your looking for a place to chill no matter what time of the day it is. This is the spot to be at!!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here for the panini special on a monday night. You get 2 paninis and a bottle of wine for $20. And then wine bottles for 50% off after that. It was a great deal and the food was amazing. We had the steak and asian short rib paninis and we loved them both. The calamari was delicious as well. I also liked that the menu has a lot of healthier options then most of the places in that area.

I have been to Dakota before at night and loved it but this was our first time eating here and it definitely won't be the last! Our service was great (specifically, Ari) and the decor is modern and beautiful. We sat on the back patio on a really nice night and the weather was perfect. Great night and great place to eat!"}
{"text":"Awesome brunch menu, outdoor seating, and modern decor. I've been during the day and the night and I enjoyed both but prefer to visit for brunch. The eggs they use are organic and the food tastes great, service is always good too!"}
{"text":"It was going to be a full few days of eating, so when I found out I was to be eating at Dakota, I knew I needed to look on the lighter side of things. Oh sure, there are sandwiches and items of greater heft, weight, and girth; but even I know my limitations and knew that a chopped salad would hit the spot for lunch.

I wasn't wrong. Although -- and mark this as a positive spin -- the salad portion was actually much larger than I thought it would be. So in the end, having the Dakota Chopped Salad was both just what I wanted, and also so much food that I ended up eating the whole thing and feeling quite full. I guess I could have stopped eating, but c'mon, I'm only human. You dangle that much lettuce, with tomato, avocado, corn, feta, and other fixins in front of me and I'm going to clean the plate right up.

It's a solid lunch option, and were I to call the area home I imagine it would find some place in my rotation. The atmosphere is fresh and new, with a little twist of old school (but not gimmicky) and I quite liked it. It seemed to be a hoppin' at the lunch hour, so I would guess you need to be on top of the ordering game and plan your lunchtime accordingly."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Ordered a simple salad that never came after 30 minutes. Stating because of big party. Not smart. I left and will NEVER go back."}
{"text":"Beautiful new bar in the entertainment district of Scottsdale.  We stopped in one night after dinner for a drink and loved the open atmosphere; however, we knew the place would turn into a club scene later that night, so we made sure to get out before it did.  Nice drink list, friendly bartenders and a beautiful space!"}
{"text":"The service is always very solid and attentive. The food is great, I recommend the short rib tacos because they're probably some of the best tacos I've ever had. What I love about Dakota is how different it is from the rest of the bars in this part of old town. My one complaint is the prices for drinks, a little high considering the comps in the area. Still, given the consistency of service and surprisingly solid food options I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"I recently stopped in and had the Braised Beef Tacos from Dakota in Scottsdale. Located in the bar district of Scottsdale, between the W Hotel and Maya, Dakota offers some of the best food in that area, which may come as a surprise considering its competitors include; Whiskey Row, El Hefe, Bevvy, Bottled Blonde, and many others. Definitely a great spot to start your weekend, whether a casual Saturday out, or Sunday Funday. I have yet to have something from there I don't like, I only wish their kitchen was open later"}
{"text":"The food is sooo good!! I live at The Stetson and never come here... I can say with conviction that we will be back. The bartender (Mimi) was super nice and attentive with honest opinions on food (even though I didn't listen to her ). 

Artichokes were good, but definitely should be served with melted butter as a dipping sauce. 

The tacos were delicious!! We ordered the pork tacos and they will be ordered again next time.

DAKOTA BOWL.... we ordered this with chicken and steak and by far my favorite dish. It's on the healthier side and was perfect in size and taste.

Decor is pretty sweet inside. We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"I have been here a few times. The service and staff are always great. I understand that it is in the \"Entertainment District\", but I found it overpriced. I was there for happy hour, and aside from my group, there were maybe 10 other people there. If you are looking for quiet time with a group, this is a great location, but if you want a social experience, I would recommend looking elsewhere."}
{"text":"I ordered a Si Senor and didn't like the drink. I informed them that I didn't like it and returned it after a sip. They still charged me for a drink that that I never finished."}
{"text":"My husband and I were having a date night and decided to give Dakota a try. We were greeted and seated promptly. Our waiter took our drink order and did not give us a look when all we ordered was water. As a matter of fact, he filled our waters up consistently throughout our meal without having to ask, and the water was good quality water, not tap water. We ordered from their $6 appetizers Happy Hour menu. The menu says 'Small Plates' so we ordered three hoping to have room to try their Caprese Grill which sounded delicious. When the food arrived we were pleasantly surprised at how large the plates were. We ordered the Calamari, Turkey Meatball Sliders and Jidori Chicken Wings. They were all really good and we even ordered another plate of the Jidori Chicken Wings. During our meal our waiter became a little busy with another table and another waitress came over to make sure we were alright and didn't need anything. How nice is that? After the appetizers we were full and got our check....only $24. We had such a great experience at Dakota and will definitely come back. I need to try that Caprese Grill!"}
{"text":"Have been here both on weekend nights and weekday night for dinner and both scenarios have been a great time. Monday and Tuesday dinner and wine specials are especially great. Staff is very friendly."}
{"text":"So this is located in the heart of old Scottsdale, strip of the bar/ night clubs. I decided to stop by with a couple of guy friends for a beer before we head to our dinner. The place got very packed over a couple hours and place turned into a night life. (Loud Music, dancing, tables, etc) Great place for a night out! Only thing it got super packed and it was hard to get around. The Bloody Mary's were delicious and I have to say, one of the best I had, considering I am a beer guy. I would recommended to friends who loves the night life."}
{"text":"Recently visited Dakota again for dinner and the food was even better than last time!! I tried the Asian Chicken Salad and it was soooo good!!! HUGE portions on the salad so it was nice to have some to take home for the next day or later that night for a evening snack! I cannot wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Blah are my feelings toward Dakota. I'm happy a new spot has opened up and the decor/renovations are beautiful. I actually loved the inside but the food wasn't anything amazing and my latte was $5 and a small. We went for breakfast and had the place to ourselves which was fun but I guess I was hoping for better food. If they had an all you could drink brunch special like RnR, I would likely go back in the morning/brunch time. I'm sure I'll give Dakota another shot and hopefully the chef can impress then. 

I also think it looks like it could be a fun bar for the night scene and I would be open to going back then!"}
{"text":"To balance this other obviously bogus review that's posted: such a great restaurant. I've come here multiple times and have never had my cell phone stolen. I've had it in my pocket, in my hand, and on the table. My phone had never felt safer than when I'm here. Oh and the food is great too."}
{"text":"Went there for a table and bottle service. The bottle service girls treated us amazingly and kept checking to make sure we were having a good time.  Will return on our next outing."}
{"text":"Great location. Love food and atmosphere! Locally owned!! Delicious lamb. Excellent night life with specialty wines and drinks."}
{"text":"Dakota sure looks different in the daytime, considering how it's packed with wall to wall music at night, and a line out the door, with people waiting to get in.

My date and I came here for mimosas and brunch. I wanted to order the Short Rib Hash, but unfortunately, they were completely sold out of this dish. Disappointed, I quickly looked for something else to order, ended up choosing the Crispy Chicken Sandwich. I was actually pleasantly satisfied with my order--it consisted of marinated and friend chicken breast with a pickle aioli and pickled veggies with shredded cabbage and romaine. I asked for a side of chipotle to dip it in. This totally hit the spot, and was the perfect meal after a night of drinking.

We were surprised at how the restaurant wasn't that busy, considering it was Easter Sunday. Actually, it was very nice to be able to enjoy our brunch in a quiet and relaxed setting. I definitely recommend coming here for brunch!"}
{"text":"This place is a lot of fun, great music and very friendly staff."}
{"text":"Hmmm...not quite sure what to make of this place.  It's right on the corner and has a nice patio for people watching.  Inside is a good sized bar area, an open floor area for standing or dancing, and a few tables and booths around the exterior.

They offer food during the day and early evening and then become a nightclub at night.

It just seems like another new place without much to set it apart or make it feel special.  It might have a slightly older crowd but in general it's the same people you see out all the time.  I get the feeling people are here because it\"s new but that will wear off soon in my opinion."}
{"text":"Not sure if this place is good. We came here with a groupon but we were denied because it was 10pm. Apparently the Groupon is good until 9pm -- this is not on the fine print of the Groupon. Silliness."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite spots in Scottsdale. It's still in the middle of all the lively bars, but it's a little more low key. Fun crowd, lots of outdoor space, great spot!"}
{"text":"Beautiful bar, very classy and modern with an industrial feel. Bunch cocktails are amazing and they have an awesome Panini & a Bottle special on Mondays and Tuesdays (2 paninis and your choice of wine bottle for only $20) perfect for a girls wine night. Also have an awesome Sunday brunch special (bottle or pitcher & breakfast entree for only $30). Perfect place any day of the week for girl time! My favorite thing to eat there is the Short Rip Hash, so much flavor!"}
{"text":"This place is in the middle where night life happens. They have a big selection of liquor and wines.  I went in for lunch while taking my Mercedes Benz for service at the scottsdale location."}
{"text":"Paid for three drinks, they gave me one. When I asked for my other two they treated me like a liar, like they had given them to me and I slipped them away. Feels like GARBAGE to be charged for 3 drinks and then treated like a criminal when I ask for  my full order. I will never come back here."}
{"text":"I can't speak to the nighclub scene, but I've been to Dakota for lunch twice now... and I've been happy both times.  I've tried two different salads and both fit the descriptions on the menu perfectly.  Portion sizes are generous and prices moderate.  I have a feeling they make their money from the drinks they sell in the evenings.  Both visits I requested a tortilla wrap on the side of my salad and that wasn't an issue.  (I highly recommend the tortilla wrap on the side of a salad by the way!)  Both times I was there, my dining companions had special orders of some sort and they were accommodated without a hassle.  Thanks for that, Dakota!

The place is large, modern and airy; and a stone's throw from the Galleria Building where my office is, so I was surprised that during both of my visits, there were only a handful of tables with diners.  The booths are large and comfortable.  

Ever since having kids, I'm not regularly out in Old Town at night any more, but I'd consider coming here for a post-work drink or two... and I hope to check out the breakfast / brunch menu soon as well.  There's definitely something for everyone."}
{"text":"I came back to Dakota for Brunch with a friend.  This was the first time I have visited during the day.  Our waitress did not know anything about the entrees and pretended she didn't hear us when we asked if the music could be turned down.  She was terrible. My food was overcooked, almost to the point that I could not eat it. I left half of it on the plate.

The music is pretty load here even at 11am. For some reason the DJ decided to turn the music up about 10 minutes  after we arrived otherwise we could have eaten someplace that is quite.  I wouldn't have minded it so much if my friend and I weren't trying to catch up and wanted to hear what each other were saying.  

Hopefully my next visit will be better."}
{"text":"Every time I make a trip to Scottsdale, Arizona I make sure I make my way to Dakota for some delicious food and tasty cocktails. The Bloodymary's are to die for and they have a variety of delicious shot specials often made by the talented and gracious bartender that goes by the name of Regis. I'm also obsessed with the breakfast burritos and huevos rancheros"}
{"text":"I had out of town guests to the club for a semi quiet night knowing the nature of Scottsdale on a Friday. We decide to go to Dakota for a drink and come home 3 blocks away. We were unable to get in on our first attempt due to dress code requirements. We went home and changed our sandals to meet the requirements and when we came back we were told we could not enter due to not having passports. Craig, the manager asked us to \"convince him\" which I assume meant to give him more money to enter. At that point I told him that the people who work for him are dumbasses for not checking ID and asking for more valid ID. He was asking for two forms of ID from people from the Czech Republic. A passport is valid anywhere in the world which is what was presented at the time and all valid. Craig decided he didn't like me calling his employees dumbasses and pushed me into another lady patron, knocking us both to the floor. Then, my wife decided to stand up for me and tell Craig that he could not push her husband down (embarrassing) and punched her in the face. Not professional or legal I'm pretty sure. When I asked him for his name, he would not give his last name as I'm sure he did not want to be recognized for what he had done. My wife, who I am so incredibly grateful for, kept me from going back to call the police and/or doing harm to Craig. I hope that anyone deciding to go to Dakota will consider the possibility of a violent and incredibly, unbelievably, horrific night."}
{"text":"We went for brunch on a Sunday. French toast was off the charts. Really cool place with a great vibe and in a great location. A great addition to the Entertainment District as Dakota has a uniquely different concept."}
{"text":"One of my favorites in Old Town! Music, great food and drink and love the outside seating. My favorite are the beef braised tacos with rice and the mac and cheese. The pours on the scotch and Hendricks are nice and never chinsy. Staff is always accommodating and friendly. Always love coming here!"}
{"text":"I came here for brunch one Sunday before hitting up one of the pool parties at Maya. This place is in a great location in Old Town, within walking distance of the clubs, and the interior is beautiful. They offer great deals on mimosas for brunch. The food, however, was just mediocre. I ordered the french toast and there was nothing special about it."}
{"text":"Great place to have a group dinner! They were able to accommodate 18 people without requiring a minimum or a prix fixe menu, not easy to find a place in Scottsdale that will do this! The service, food  and of course drinks were fantastic. Well done!"}
{"text":"Dakota is A-OK for a quick lunch. The menu has it all: burgers, sandwiches, wings, hotdogs, pasta, sliders meatballs, salads, and seriously so much more.  I ordered the kale salad with chicken. It was your standard kale salad with golden raisins, almonds, parmesan cheese. I added chicken. The portion was generous and made for a perfect entree. Prices are fair, portions are large and you can easily have a 1 hour working lunch. The space is light and bright by day and apparently turns into a nightclub. I kept wondering how they could possibly fit hundreds of people in there...but they do!"}
{"text":"Maybe it's just the type of people that this club attracts, but men here are extremely aggressive and feel that it's ok to touch and grope women without permission. It's not acceptable to create this type of vibe, and normalize this as \"club culture.\"
My friend and I were harassed repeatedly, and I know another girl who was stalked around the club. I'm sure that Dakota isn't the only club where this is prevalent, but it seems to be a dominant theme here.
Are the bartenders over serving? Are the bouncers not trained enough as far as identifying what the unwanted behavior looks like? Management needs to come up with some strategies ASAP to prevent this type of behavior."}
{"text":"Upscale dining (delish brunch) plus sports on TV's, plus DJ, plus good service, and next to all the hot bars/clubs.

The brunch BLT burger w/fries was very good. Drinks are awesome.

And on top of that, free beer (any!) with a Yelp check-in I found randomly. Awesome!"}
{"text":"I went on a Saturday night. The age group is definitely different from El Hefe. The bouncer even told me it's more of a mom bar - which was okay for me to ask because I was with my cousin who was a mom. It still has amazing music and the ambiance is definitely on point. I love how there is plentiful of seating outside unlike other bars I'm old town.
I was not appreciative of the alcohol - which is kind of the main reason why we go out...am I right? When we got there I got a cranberry vodka, maybe the easiest to make plus 2 other drinks. No taste of vodka whatsoever. I asked the bartender if there was vodka in here? And answered me with attitude. Of course no tip. I don't know who he was trying to fool but that was a rip off. Usually I can drink 2 drinks and I'm feeling fuzzy! But damn it took me 2 cranberry vodkas and 4 shots to feel that Saturday night confidence we all look for. And I am considered a light weight by the way. 

So I highly recommend to pre game before going to this bar. Or just go to another one...

It's 3 stars because of the music, I can sit when I'm tired dancing, and luckily I went with the right people for my first time in Dakota."}
{"text":"My experience at Dakota was a really unfortunate one for SO many reasons.  For the sake of objectivity, I'll list the good first.
The Good:
Great atmosphere and it's really clean.
The Bad:
The staff isn't friendly... with customers.  They're friendly with each other, but as a customer I felt like such an inconvenience to the waitress who was busy flirting with her coworker.  Not to mention the service is horrible (but that's because the staff is obviously busy socializing with one another).   It took way too long for the waitress to take our orders. She never even asked if we wanted drinks.  The food was then super delayed, she rushed to take our plates away but then it took her 20 minutes to bring us our check, and another 20 for her to pick up our payment.
I would love to say the food is just mediocre, but that's being too generous.  The fries are really greasy; greasy to the point where I could see pools of oil on my plate.  The sandwiches are just okay, nothing special and definitely not worth the $10+ I paid.  My biggest complaint about the food is that it's apparently taboo to ask for substitutions.  If it's not exactly how it's listed on the menu, you're not getting it.  For such a fancy looking place, the menu is just blah.  Dissappointing. 
I want to like this place, I really do, but I think they spent too much time making this place LOOK like a great establishment and not enough time focusing on the fundamentals of a good restaurant.  Train your employees, add some integrity to your menu, and then maybe you can be deserving of more than one star."}
{"text":"Run don't walk. The employees at this place are literally the worse people in the world."}
{"text":"I enjoy the atmosphere here - the people are generally in their 30's+ and have a bit more class than the other local places.  Their is no dress code, but people dress stylish and show that they can take care of themselves.  I do not, however, recommend this place for food.  Their updated menu is low grade bar food and not tasty at all.  I prefer to come here after eating someplace else."}
{"text":"Very  upscale decor, lots of Scottsdale ladies in 30s to 50s at the bar and a couple old men ogling the younger ones, The bartender wasgreat, food was okay, we used Groupon so felt okay about that. I think I might come here for Happy Hour again but not for dinner. Bar experience better than the food experience. Turns all dance club at night, I was told but we were out too early for that deal."}
{"text":"Cool club diverse people and ages always have a great time workers are cool... people there are pretty friendly"}
{"text":"I gave 3 stars for the great atmosphere, service and beautiful [huge] outdoor patio. We enjoyed sitting at the bar near the patio (which will accommodate large group gatherings). The reason Dakota didn't get 5 stars is because the food is mediocre at best. We have been here twice now. Last time my cob salad was really lacking and not as described on the menu. I had to request a couple of items named on the menu. This visit my fiancee ordered the skirt steak as his entree. It is only a few tasteless thin strips of the steak on top of a pile of french fries. He ordered it medium-rare and it was well-done, tough and chewy, however, the chimmichuri sauce on the side was good. I ordered my hamburger with \"salad\" instead of french fries, which was a big pile of greens on the plate dumped out of a bag, nothing else. The grilled onions and provolone cheese that I paid $3 extra for (making it $16) were a thin slice of cheese and the amount of onions under the cheese was so small I couldn't even taste them. If they had been included, I probably wouldn't care so much, but you pay extra for them! (At least cheese should be included on a $13 hamburger.) To the restaurant's credit, the burger was cooked Medium as ordered, and Mike's entree was comped. Someone needs to rework the limited menu, and the kitchen needs a Chef's supervision and/or more talented cooks. I do need to comment on the EXCELLENT service we received from Madison, who was very pleasant and attentive."}
{"text":"Place is amazing so is the music BUT be very careful how much they charge you for a drink.. My friends and I were there on Saturday September 3,  2016 and for the same drinks the price was  different every single time! First drink was 10$ then one hr later I was changed 8$ per drink and some of my friends paid 12 $ for the same drink.. We always leave great tips as well but don't assume we are drunk or can't do the math! Make sure you pay attention to the bill every single time!  

Update: We purchased the drinks between 11:30 pm and 1 am.. I don't think there is a happy hr at that time especially on a Saturday night and if there is we weren't informed! I understand everyone wants to make a quick buck but honesty is the key for any success!!!"}
{"text":"Cool decorating and nice employees. A little more upscale. Prices were higher than some of the other nearby places. We sat outside and it was fun."}
{"text":"Thought I'd upload a few photos from my October 2016 visit to Dakota and put in a short review.  It was shortly after disappointing Comoncy (attached sister coffee/breakfast place) visit where my pancakes took forever in arriving, and when they did arrive, they were HEAVILY-salted.  Mom's sirloin sandwich that morning was made with a skirt steak cut, and it came out very hard to chew.  They maintained that it was a sirloin cut, but offered to make her a new one, which was slightly better, but Mom was already disappointed in going.  Mom and I were invited to return again and that the GM would \"take care of\" us.  What he didn't know was that I had a Groupon for Dakota that I purchased prior to the Comoncy visit, and it was time to use it, or forfeit the value of the Groupon.

I had $40 to use up, so I ordered a Tcho Mocha ($5), a Beverly Hills Club (sandwich; $11) without avocado (allergy), a Baked Macaroni & Cheese with added chicken ($12 + $3 add), and a Kale Salad, also with added chicken ($11 + $3 add).  Everything was very tasty, but the club sandwich arrived with avocado in it. https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/dakota-scottsdale?select=Wf0cKXK2qzbz8mLC4D8zZw  I flagged an assisted manager and told him about it, and he immediately offered to get another one made without avocado.  He also told me I could take the first sandwich home and give it to someone who wasn't allergic to avocado, which  I thought was very nice of him.  The multi-grain bread used in the sandwich was very nice.  I think Dakota features MJ bread, but I'm not 100% positive.  The mac 'n cheese featured heavy cream from Laveen, AZ's Danzeisen farm, \"fresh herbs, sharp cheddar, Monterey Jack, & parmesan cheeses.\"  This also came with a wonderful grilled baguette. https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/dakota-scottsdale?select=-_X5wd4aces_dmzeTmUInQ  I had to stop myself from eating too much, since I still had to try the Kale salad!  This was my very first try of a kale salad, and I was hooked!  I haven't been back since October, but I would definitely go back and order this terrific salad again, with its green kale, as well as romaine lettuces, toasted almond slivers, large and plump golden raisins, quinoa, parmesan cheese, and shallots, all with a light drizzle of lemon vinaigrette! https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/dakota-scottsdale?select=LE8XnRZnew2tSbJiO5omYw

I knew with all that I'd ordered, I was going to have a positive balance of around $5 plus tax and tip.  I received a small adjustment for the kitchen's mistake of including avocado in the club sandwich, but still would have to pay $27.85.  I told my server that I would just use my Groupon and left her more than 20% tip (I think I gave her $10.)

I may return again, but not till I try all my other valley bookmarks first!"}
{"text":"Amazing decor and great vibe.  I love coming here for brunch. I came here with my family for Easter brunch and had the best chicken sandwich ever! Crispy chicken sandwich I added avocado and pepper jack cheese. I recommend smoking for a side of honey mustard to dip your fries and drippings in."}
{"text":"The service was over the top excellent! The food was good and the atmosphere is nice, not to Loud and yet tons of action.  I think it's a nice balance between a club and a nice lounge.  They did it right!  Madison the assistant manager is incredible and really knows how to make you feel like you are at home.  Service is every thing and the ladies at Dakota nailed it!! Six stars!!"}
{"text":"Good staff, food, drinks and fantastic decor! It is a must see if your in old town. The staff when I walked in had the most positive attitude and turned my \"hangry\" mood inside out.  Thanks ladies!"}
{"text":"Beware!!! Racist Establishment during a night of bar hopping we decided to get in line at Dakota and after waiting in line for about 30 minutes we get the front to only be told if we are not buying a table we may not enter. If they were at capacity I would understand but just hanging around a group of gentleman after us Euro-Americans were let right in without the same requirements once this happen I kindly ask the bouncer what was the difference besides racist he did not have an answer but instead pointed to his GM which was a African Gentleman and when I simply said hi. He rudely cut me off and said your not getting in my n***** then denied saying such words. I will never spend my money here that's not how people should be treated I even have video footage to show the racism if I can give no star I would"}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with hanging out here Friday and Saturday nights! The music is popping and the drinks are strong! The staff from the doormen, bouncers and bartenders have the best customer service. It's crowded but not stuffy. Mixed age group of people."}
{"text":"Went here for Sunday brunch. It wasn't crowded, so we got seated right away. Big plus. The day we were there was the waiters first day. He was very sweet. Food was yummy and there was ample portions."}
{"text":"Cool spot. But YUCKY food. If you go for a drink and people watching your good but DO NOT EAT"}
{"text":"The drinks and food where great!
We loved our server!  Calli you Rock!!
What a beautiful evening on the patio next to the fire place.  Really cool people at this place, we will be back!"}
{"text":"Had lunch there today. Not a good experience, 20 minute + ticket time on sandwiches. I stepped to the bar to ask about our food and the girl behind the bar seemed to be more interested in texting than taking care of customers. Our waiter replied it should be up any minute. He shortly brought our food, the fries were terrible cold, the sandwich was cold. obviously the waiter had not picked up the food in a timely manner. Later he came back to refresh my daughters water, but not mine. We asked for the check and it took him over 10 minutes to come back for the payment and return the receipt. Whom ever owns the business, your managers are driving it into the ground. Will not go there again."}
{"text":"Great food with a great atmosphere. Tried several of their small plates and wasn't dissatisfied with any of them. The happy hour menu had awesome food and drink specials. Taylor is great"}
{"text":"Very hip.. would be 5 stars but I suspect this establishment is in cahoots with big oil corporations as they are not green energy friendly.  Tried to ride my bike onto the patio and the manager found it to be very disrespectful and told me I was fortunate not to be kicked out.  When I asked them to valet it outside they refused and I haven't seen my bike since.  Other than that they've got some smokin deals on champagne for Sunday brunch.  Good times.  Also Jasmine is awesome."}
{"text":"The drinks here are waaaaay too expensive for the quality of drink you receive. $15 for a cocktail. Whoa. The outdoor patio was nice. We ordered the hummus and it was very plain. However we did enjoy the Dakota Bowl and their fries. So a few hits and misses. I wouldn't have tried this place unless I had a groupon."}
{"text":"I went here for dinner with 12 girls for my friends bachelorette weekend. I will say that the waiter was very nice and the place itself is cool but overall we had a bad experience. The first bad sign was that we were basically the only people in the place at 7:30 on a Friday night. It took far too long to get drinks given it looked like they plenty of employees just standing around. Once we got the drinks they were not good...too sugary and the flavors were off. 

We could deal with drinks being off but then the food situation wasn't any better. We had to send back the grilled artichokes because they were so incredibly dry. 2 girls ordered a grilled sandwich that came out completely cold. All of the side salads were field greens with absolutely no dressing. 

Don't waste your money on this place!"}
{"text":"Only gets one star because it's maybe the worst service I've had in awhile. Tex decided that after waiting in line to see my friends for an hour or so, it didn't matter, even though we had been separated and there was plenty of room in the \"club\". Next time I go to Scottsdale, I'll be sure to literally poke my own eyeballs out before I go to any bar of this affiliation."}
{"text":"I love Dakota, but I wish they would update their music selection."}
{"text":"Well, this time it is UNFORGIVABLE!! My phone was STOLEN for the second time at this horrific establishment. In all my years of partying in old town, this has NEVER happened ANYWHERE. 

GFY, Dakota. I hope your place shuts down. A-holes."}
{"text":"One of my least favorite places in the hood. The establishment charges similar to an upscale bar but does not give an upscale experience. Service was basically non existent. We weren't served at all, the bartender ended up coming to grab our orders because she felt bad for us. When the food arrived, it was really bad-- no one in our party of 8 enjoyed their food. Drinks were normal-- but took forever for us to order and get. I don't recommend coming here, there are too many other options around these streets."}
{"text":"This place is by far the new hot spot in Scottsdale! Dakota has it all. Amazing food, excellent staff, great nightlife and breath taking decor. I highly suggest you check this place out."}
{"text":"Not at all happy about this place.  Was a hour wait to just step in ... we were not even eating! Ended up leaving.  The place was half empty ... but still would not let people in..."}
{"text":"I would recommend this place for a group of mixed interests.  There is outdoor seating, a bar inside, and a dance floor.  The music is a mix of top 40 and old school hits, I'd say something for everyone.

We were able to find a spot to sit outside, however it eventually got very crowded.  We relocated to the dance floor, and it was about what you'd expect at any club.  The drinks seemed to be mixed well, and rather strong.  

The bathroom situation was chaotic.  There is an attendant to hand out paper towels.  There is also a table of gum and other miscellaneous items that completely blocked the sink.  It's a nice gesture, but not in such a small place.  There was no organization to the line, and the line for the me s restroom kind of blocked the women who were waiting from getting into the restroom itself."}
{"text":"I have only came here for lunch. I have heard great things about coming for dinner and cocktails though. 

I came here with a few lady friends and got breakfast food. The food was not only pretty but tasty. The service was good and we walked away feeling like princesses. Try the French toast you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Found this place in Groupon. I thought it was great. It was pretty dead for lunch on a Wednesday, we didn't mind. Less crowded the better. Sat outside, good seating and ambiance. Leaves were a little scatter around seating area but not terrible. 
Waiter was nice and accommodating. 
Food came at good time. Honey hot wings were decent, wish they were bigger but overall they were good. The rosemary tasting fries and burger were really good. I would go back."}
{"text":"Great ambience, great food.. Definitely a chill HR great service.. They are on point and very friendly.. I will be back.."}
{"text":"We went early for happy hour and sat on the patio.  Service was excellent and food very good.  The turkey meatball sliders were very good."}
{"text":"Do NOT come here for the food or drinks! I hate that I have to give this restaurant even one star. This should only be a nightclub because the food and drinks are terrible. My group sat outside, only to be sat on cushions that had been thrown up on and not cleaned. The smell was awful and none of us could sit there ignoring it. The waitress didn't seem to care or believe us (even though it was clearly visible on the cushion) and we personally had to move our tables to another section in the outdoor area (all girls might I add). The food is what you would expect to be served at a fast food restaurant that's going out of business any day. The service is mediocre and the drinks are expensive. I ordered a regular Vodka & Redbull....$16.00. Unless you are here to dance once the restaurant becomes a club, save your money and go elsewhere."}
{"text":"The ambiance is amazing. Very low key during the day time. Very relaxing environment but at the same time upbeat enough to keep you entertained by watching the football games.  Loved the food!!! Waitresses are very attentive as well.  Great place to go!!!!!"}
{"text":"OMG SO FREAKING GOOD!!! We got the baked mac and cheese and it was delish but the BEST is the egg bowl (substitute avocado for the chicken). Seriously the BEST combo of brown rice, red quinoa, and eggs! 

The decor in this place is gorgeous! Service was great!"}
{"text":"Had a quiet dinner at 7 PM at Dakotas. I had a great Sonoran chicken salad. Good food, great service, great ambience with a comfy outside patio in March. This would be a good date place for a quiet drink. 

Two thumbs up."}
{"text":"The only positive thing I have to say is the drink was decent. However, I had to flag down a bartender while sitting at the bar. It wasn't that busy. When the bartender did look at me, I wasn't greeted she just stared at me until I said what I wanted. I thought maybe she just had a bad attitude, but the people who came in after me received a warm smile and greeting. After finishing my drink, no one ever came back to ask if wanted a refill (which I did) and continued to serve other people around me and within my group (all guys). I get that most bartenders think only guys tip at bars, but don't screw yourself out of tip with your unwarranted bias! I decided to leave to somewhere that wants my money. Little do they know it's my birthday weekend and 20 of my friends were on their way. I had them and their money go elsewhere."}
{"text":"I've decided to give Dakota another chance and it is starting to grow on me.  Dakota seems to have gotten better since it first opened.  I do not know exactly what it is, perhaps new bouncers or servers, but a bit more of a relaxed environment which I like."}
{"text":"I came here for my friends birthday on a Saturday night. 

Their food menu is very limited, mostly tacos and sandwiches. 

I ordered the appetizer fish tacos it came with two for $8.99 and the entree is $13.99 that comes with rice and beans. 

The food wasn't bad, but just a little overpriced. The service was descent, but we had to wait a while to order drinks for my friend and I. 

Overall, the restaurant/bar is very modern and trendy, I would say that it wouldn't be my choice of picking."}
{"text":"Great place to hit up when in Scottsdale \"\"I didn't eat so this review is based on the drinks & the scene here first off Scottsdale has beautiful women all over the place and Dakota does not disappoint!! Get the big apple  drink & ask a girl to dance .."}
{"text":"Located in the heart of old town Scottsdale we were surpirsed that it place was not busy at all Friday evening.  We tried some appertizers and a couple of entrees, and food was underwhelming.  The pork taco tasted fattening, and pretty much all items, except chicken wing, tasted bland."}
{"text":"Only had drinks but the ambiance is great. Huge chairs and cool interior theme. Good lounge."}
{"text":"My friend S(M) & I meet for lunch almost every Friday. Occasionally we're joined by other friends and today S(F) joined us. On this Friday, the 3 of us decided to meet at Dakota.
Well, to be fair, it ended up being our second choice because the \"Blonde\" place across the street was not open for lunch. Ooops. So we ended up at Dakota on a Friday at 1 in the afternoon. The place was not very busy. 

The decor of Dakota is very nice and there's a cool vibe that Dakota exudes. I felt comfortable the moment we walked in. We were sat at a nice table just inside the door.

Our server was Matthew. He was fine but the kitchen was slow. Maybe to save money they only have a couple of cooks in the back but it was S L O W getting food. And, if you're going to serve lunch and hope business people make up your customers, ya gotta speed it up. 
Now, if you're planning on all your lunch customers being snow birds, retiree's, or just people with a lot of free time, than no worries. You got them covered. Since we don't have 2+ hours to lunch, we found ourselves eating quickly once our food did arrive.

All 3 of us ordered the same thing. The Dakota Burger ($13) and Iced Tea ($3 ea). The basic burger comes on a locally made Brioche Bun, Scallion aioli, chopped mixed greens and a sliced Roma Tomato. Then you can add stuff from a good list for 50 cents a pop. All 3 of us added Blue Cheese, S(M) added Caramelized Onions and I added Avocado. 
All 3 of us ordered our burgers at different temps and unfortunately, only one of the 3 patties was done correctly. Here's the deal. Dakota uses Pat LaFrieda Beef. This stuff is Angus Beef, never frozen stuff shipped out of New Jersey. Can't be cheap. Well, we know it can't be cheap because these burgers weren't cheap. But anyway, if you're going to go to all the trouble of having some awesome beef you should remind your cooks that the beef isn't run of the mill stuff and to be more respectful of it and the customer.

So aside from the meat temp., the burgers were fine. The Brioche Bun was really very good. The Avocado on mine was fresh. We had a nice lunch with a slower pace than we would have preferred but overall, it was a decent experience. I do think the prices are high and there are other places nearby that don't charge as much. $70 for the 3 of us to have a burger lunch is not going to make us regulars.
Beautiful space. Pleasant Staff. Great Burger. High Prices. 4 Stars."}
{"text":"I went to Dakota with a group from work for a lunch break and it was the best! The set up was so trendy and bright. 
I ordered the Grilled Chicken Panini which was delish and it came with a side salad. The panini was bomb but we also ordered the Garlic Fries and those really hit the spot! 
We had a lot of fun and a lot of good food. I would definitely recommend Dakota!"}
{"text":"WOW!!!  First off, the place is gorgeous.  Hats off to the designers and craftsmen that put this place together - well done - very well done.  I attended the friends and family opening the other night; a good friend of mine Tay Black invited me..  Tay gave me a tour and I was really impressed.  I was especially impressed with the coffee shop.  Tay told me they will have coffee on tap; that is not something you can really find in Scottsdale so I'm super excited about that..  On another note I wanted to point out how professional and courteous the security staff was. Their security is obviously not your run of the mill old town \"bouncer\"..  
Between the awesome staff and good food and great atmosphere I'm sure Dakota is going to be the new go to spot for Scottsdale's young partying professionals."}
{"text":"Classy place that doesn't allow men with sandals after 9 but drunk girls puking on the balcony. Loud and obnoxious bar that's  overrated."}
{"text":"The only thing going for this place is the music. Oh and the couches are comfy. Waited for service for 20 minutes, so I went to the bar to order drinks and inform the bartender we needed service. She said she would send someone over. Shortly after, the waiter came, and said he assumed we were being taken care of..based off of what? We had no water, utensils, drinks, nothing. He also had walked past us about 6 times and ignored us. Had no problem servicing the two tables on either side of us.

Had to ask for water twice, utensils never came, when I asked for napkins, he brought me the bar napkins. Also, he told me they ran out of mayo, when I asked for it. Oh...ok."}
{"text":"Dakota offers a perfectly acceptable lunch option for those in the area. I can't speak to it as an after hours or clubby destination. Truth be told, I don't even know that I got a good, solid look at the building. I came here for a quick group work lunch. Rather than a lazy outing, this was a perfunctory in-and-out operation. I appreciated the army-like precision the Dakota folks used to get food/drink orders to us with nary a minute wasted. That's professionalism.

Knowing that I was coming for a quick sit-n-eat, I opted for a salad. Had I had more time, I might have decided on something different but short on time + annoying dietary issues = salad. The Sonora Salad was a fine way to put some appetizing calories in one's body... but it wasn't that thrilling. My first impression of the salad was that it was cold. Like, came straight from the refrigerator cold. I appreciate a cool, crisp salad in a warm environment but this was are-my-teeth-sensitive-to-temperature cold. The second thing I noticed was that the chicken was more cubed than shredded. It's not a huge deal; it's more of a missed texture expectation. The description of the dish mentioned grilled shredded chicken. Most everything else was as expected: romaine, corn, black beans, tomato, tortilla strips, cilantro, and shallots (not many). I don't know whether my dressing was very subtle or just not well-tossed. I didn't pick up the chipotle ranch dressing. Again, not a huge deal as I'm not a fan of an overly-dressed salad but if you are, I might ask for some extra on the side. Keeping things exciting, I drank water with lemon.

I'm curious to know what Dakota offers in a more laid-back or raucous evening environment. The cocktail menu looks pretty interesting and worth some time to dig into. As a quick spot for an uncomplicated lunch, it's a-ok. It's casual. It's inoffensive and eating here will get you back to work/meetings in no time. If working in the area, it should probably be in your rotation."}
{"text":"$16 for one drink.... enough said... I'm all for a good time, but man! What a rip off!"}
{"text":"This is definitely a high end restaurant/bar. Dakota has great décor all around. The vibe makes me want to put a fancy cocktail dress on. The patio has a lot of seating and great corner to see the other clubs. The bar is where I like to sit, and the chairs are pretty but a little too bulky. 

There food is on a B+ scale. Very ordinary brunch and lunch menu. No bar food; its more like sandwiches and salads. 

Brunch is the time of day I like to go to and there have been several specials that I've like; specials change time to time. On Sundays they have $1 mimosas for ladies. We didn't find this out till after the bill. It would great if the staff would communicate and tell the daily specials. 

The night scene gets crowded and the prices are over priced for a tiny drink. I'll stick to brunch Sundays. Its really a hit or miss depending what kind of food and atmosphere you're looking for."}
{"text":"There were wings, burgers, reubens, corn dogs, and fried chicken sandwiches on the menu, and I ordered a salad. So it's my own fault, really. 

I do have a penchant for ordering dishes named after the restaurant, as I assume they are specialties and thus among their best options, and the Dakota Chopped Salad sounded delightful:

It was to have organic baby field greens, Persian romaine, AND iceberg lettuce. I was intrigued by this foreign romaine, and excited to see how it differed from regular old hearts of romaine. Unfortunately, iceberg was all that was to be found.

Promised were heirloom cherry tomatoes, cucumbers, regular tomato, carrots, avocado, grilled corn, crispy bacon, garbanzo beans, feta, and a yogurt dill dressing. Of all that, there was a bit of tomato (neither heirloom nor cherry), maybe three bits of bacon, a smattering of feta, cucumber, and several kernels of corn. There was no carrot, maybe a tiny morsel of avocado, and the dressing was nowhere to be found (upon asking for some on the side, I received a tasty ramekin full of it, although it was unappetizingly separating). 

There were plenty of garbanzo beans, which is a statement I don't relish making.

Essentially, I ordered a salad with all the things, and it only had a few of the things, not the ones I really wanted, and not nearly enough of them. To be fair, my friends' fried chicken sandwich and steak salad looked infinitely more appealing. 

The clear lesson is to never order a salad again."}
{"text":"Bouncer had the audacity to tell me that my real, authentic, Florida ID was \"altered\" because of a crease because of how much it's bent when visiting these type of venues. He wanted to argue and say that he couldn't let me in because of my ID being like that even though it's 100% real. Obviously the security needs more training here on how to look at other state's IDs, you can't deny someone entry based on the fact that you can't read or understand another ID. Instead of getting the police involved, luckily, I had a backup ID that he allowed because he had no choice. Once inside, the floors were extremely wet/dirty and an obvious hazard. However, I was by a table and had a great time listening to the music and drinking. Paid $8 for a drink and it had me right, the bartender was very polite and made the drink nice and strong for me. Bathrooms are a disaster, didn't even use it and waited until we got to the next venue. Social wise: This is a cool place with good music.
Business wise: Needs work, especially on cleanliness and security."}
{"text":"Food was surprisingly good for a bar-type setting. The service was outstanding. Waitress did a great job making sure we were comfortable and enjoyed our dining experience."}
{"text":"UPDATE - Erik, I appreciate the response, but what you said is incorrect. I uploaded a photo of today's cocktail menu showing drinks at $15 apiece. Your link URL appears to be from 2014. 

Eh, it was ok. Menu is kind of all over the place. Entrees consist of a steak, a pasta dish, mac & cheese, tacos, etc. It seems more like a club than a restaurant. The food wasn't bad. The cocktails are $15 apiece for a cocktail. I know it's downtown Scottsdale, but that felt way overpriced to me. No big urgency to go back."}
{"text":"Such a pretty bar and the food is amazing! Plenty of tv's to watch the game on and a really nice place to drink."}
{"text":"Great club, like the vibe, and they play good hip hop music. It gets crowded but I don't mind, better than being boring. We got a table here for my birthday and had the best night!"}
{"text":"After 9pm they do not allow men to wear flip flops. You can't get in, but if you show up in sandles before 9 you won't be asked to leave. Hypocrites, really. Don't go here."}
