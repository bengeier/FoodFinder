{"text":"I love love Cuban food so I was thrilled that there was a place so close to me.  Unfortunately, this place was a big letdown.  I've gotten food here twice and both times were mediocre at best.  I ordered the cuban sandwich the first time and the fillings looked as though they were just thrown in.  And they forgot my fries and when I asked for them, I got a side of cold, limp ones.  Next time, I got the lechon asado and it was really fatty (I know this isn't a lo-cal dish, but there was almost more fat than meat), the sauce was really bland (couldn't even taste the bitter/sour orange) and the onions were cooked until they were mushy.  Also, the servers weren't very friendly during either visit (big negative for me).

This is very sad since I was really hoping for the best for Havana Grill."}
{"text":"It was OKAY but not True True Cuban Food.  Just moved from Miami Florida and being Cuban American my husband and I know real Cuban food. No Cuban bread it's French bread. Very over priced.  But it wasn't too bad."}
{"text":"Great food and great service!  What more can I say except try the shrimp salad!!  Delicious!!"}
{"text":"Great authentic Cuban food. Great atmosphere. The servers and chef were extremely nice, especially to my young kids. They went out of their way to serve us and made us feel very comfortable. The food was delicious, and cooked to perfection"}
{"text":"We had a Groupon and decided to try this place out.  Coming from Florida, we had high expectations. We were surprised that the place was empty at 12ish on Thursday.  We were literally the only customers.  The place is very nicely decorated. The waitress told us that we couldn't order Cuban coffee because the machine was broken.  We were disappointed.  So we ordered food and mojitos.  The food was kinda bland.  The mojitos were ok. At the end of the meal, a different waitress offered coffee.  Turns out the machine wasn't broken. Wtf?  We probably won't be back."}
{"text":"I spent the money so you don't have to, here is what transpired about the food. Ordered from Bite Squad and it took Havana Grill about 55 mins to fix things up, I had high hopes for this meal but it was horrid. The Cuban sandwich was fair at best , I think I have tasted better at Subway and that's no lie, nothing special about it at all, lacked flavor and it was bland, next was the Pan Con pollo la plancha, it says they marinate it , outright lie there, it wasn't marinated in anything at all, it was dry, flavorless, utterly disgusting and I could only stomach 1.5 bites of it and that was it, absolutely disgusting.   The black beans and rice served with bacon and spices was ok, nothing great about it but at least it had some flavor, the fries the sandwiches were served with were fair, once again nothing special there and there wasn't much of them served. The chips and salsa was a joke, the chips were ok much like any other Latino place but the green salsa was so bland, zero flavor, no heat. 
Overall it was a waste of time and money, if a place can't even make a Cubana sandwich correctly and with some flavor there is a problem. This place needs work, heavy work in the kitchen, the food was disgusting for the most part. Save your money and go elsewhere."}
{"text":"The only place that I have been able to find a great Cuban sandwich.  The staff is very friendly and they have a great happy hour!  Perfect before going to see a movie."}
{"text":"I don't get this place. Maybe we ordered the wrong things, but my husband and I left extremely disappointed. The shrimp ceviche was overly drenched in lime juice and were served with grocery store chips, the tamales barely had any filling, the puerco fritas were extremely dry, and the mojitos were watered down. The best thing about our meal was the free bread."}
{"text":"I had been meaning to try this place for a long time when the GF announced that she had a groupon that was about to expire.  Great!

We stopped in for lunch on a weekday and the place was almost deserted.  We both had the Cuban sandwich with fries...I guess we just couldn't resist.  Our waiter, Carlos, was very friendly and promptly brought out our drinks and a basket of hot buttery bread.

The sandwiches were good and the fries were perfectly done.  My only gripe was about the small amount of ketchup provided in a little side cup.  Why can't I decide how much ketchup I need?  We asked for more and another few droplets arrived.

I'm sure we'll come back, especially being this close to the theater."}
{"text":"Positives: the drinks are great and the bartender was very friendly and offered great suggestions.  Also, the drink prices are pretty reasonable.

Negatives: ummm, the food.  Tried the lechon asado and it was missing the \"lechon.\"  It wasn't tart at all!...it was actually kind of sweet.  That definitely threw me off.  Just weird.  And the rice was cold and hard.  My friend got the chicken and rice and her dish was cold as well.  The rice lacked the bright saffron color you would expect and was oversaturated with the cooking liquid.  She ate about three bites and quit.

Even though the drinks are pretty good and the decor is nice, I don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"Well it isn't Miami, but it is the best Cuban food in Las Vegas. The tostones, vaca frita, lechon asado, platanos maduro, yuca, flan and tamal are extremely authentic. The rest of the dishes not extremely good but not horrible either, in some cases not really Cuban either. I have to say being Cuban I miss the food from Miami, but this is as authentic as it gets. It turns into a nightclub/restaurant after 9pm on the weekends and can get a little loud, but the ambiance is nice. The staff is also very pleasant. I am giving it a five star rating again because it is in Vegas. If it was in Miami it would get a 3 1/2 star."}
{"text":"Food was good. Waiter was cool. Enjoyed the sauce which had garlic and lemon.  I know this is Vegas but I kept smelling cigarette smell as if someone is smoking but no one dining in was smoking. I'm not a smoker so I am a bit sensative to the smoke smell."}
{"text":"First, the food is average. It would be okay if it weren't so expensive. Basically this place has a \"hole in the wall\" menu with \"sit down restaurant\" prices.  For instance, you'll order some rice and beans with a little meat,  tostones and a beer that should  cost no more than $10 and here its going to cost your more like $30. 

All of this would would garner them a 3 star review perhaps. But I had a had my credit card number stolen at the restaurant. After paying with my card, about a week later I learned that my card had been duplicated, and approximately $1000 of gas, food and Bachata concert tickets had been purchased on the counterfeit card. My credit card company spotted the activity. And I figured out that it happened at Havana Grill. 

So pay with cash or follow the waiter to the cash register and keep an eye on your card."}
{"text":"Their food use to be decent but I've been disappointed with the quality of the food the past 2 years and because of that I've been going less and less. I decided to give them one more try because I'm Cuban and  was craving comfort food plus I was really really hungry.  When I called to place the order, it sounded like the gal/waitress was trying to do several things at the same time and got my order wrong 3times so I had to repeat it till she decided to pay attention. I ordered a $12 pan con bistec which you figure how can they screw that up right? Well guess what, It was horrible. Like I said I was really hungry so I sat in my car to eat and couldn't even finish it. For $12 I got a slither of a dried out really really thin piece of steak, the bread was stale and the mariquitas were burnt. I tossed it and went down the street and enjoyed an In and Out burger. I WILL NOT BE GOING BACK."}
{"text":"I have eaten here about 10 times and everything is always excellent. Today I went in and got arroz con pollo (highly recommend), and it came out a little cold. I gave it back to the server, and they completely remade the dish. Honestly having worked in restaurants I didn't care if they just heated it up, but they went above and beyond, and comped my entire meal. They have earned a life customer."}
{"text":"It seems like management for this place changed because the last time we were here (2013) food was very good and service was excellent. 
We came back ( 6/24/2016) and everything has changed. Food was so-so and service was terrible. For a party of 5, it took about an hour to order and get our food and we had to chase our waiter or any staff to get refills of water. And the place was not busy at all.
Rose P."}
{"text":"The Tostones here are OFF THE CHAIN!! The only thing that was sub par for an amazing Cuban place was the Tres Leches. Tasted like birthday cake in Milk. 

Would probably go 3 stars on this place for the Tres Leches but loved the rest so much we have to give it props."}
{"text":"I ate here for the first, and last, time tonight. I can't remember the name of the sandwich I ordered, but it was steak with caramelized onions on smashed bread. It was dry, dry, dry. The onions were about half cooked, certainly not caramelized. The steak, besides being dry, had no flavor. I guess the best thing I had was a few french  fries. Two people in our party arrived late, placed their orders, and waited. And waited. Finally, someone brought the bill. All of the orders, even the late ones were on there, along with the tip, but still the food hadn't arrived. They had to ask for it again. It was never even made."}
{"text":"I was so disappointed by the food here. I have heard great things and I was eager to try it. My friend and I both ordered the bistec palomilla and the steak was void of flavor. We were both disappointed. I have been to Cuba and on thing that Cuban food is never lacking is flavor. I  will not be returning here.
OAN:  the atmosphere was nice.and It seems like a nice place to have drinks."}
{"text":"I purchased a Groupon for Havana Grill and didn't know what to expect, once again based on previous Yelp reviews. Thankfully, they once again were not reliable. 

The service was awesome! Everything was so scrumptious! From the bread, to the dessert at the end of our mean, it was all delicious. Not to mention the paella was the best I've had! 
 
Definitely a pleasant surprise!"}
{"text":"I'm not really sure how this place has so many good reviews. I feel deceived by Yelp! I came here after seeing the great reviews but was so  disappointed!!! Being Dominican and Haitian and from NYC, the food wasn't all that great.  We ordered the steak and onion and it was so dry, chewy as hell and tasteless. The rice and beans were okay. The Cuban sandwich was the worst we ever had. It wasn't flavorful and kinda of dry. Would not recommend this place to anyone! The food SUCKS!!!! Save your money!!!"}
{"text":"We came across this place because we used to drive to their sister location on Las Vegas Blvd. (Florida Cafe) and Havana Grill is closer to me. The appetizers are better at Florida Cafe but the main dishes here at Havana Grill are better. 

We always get the breaded steak w/ onions and the pork w/ onions. I never liked black beans until I had them from here. They are so good w/ the rice they have. I feel that its a little pricey for the type of food and atmosphere they have but that definitely will not stop me from going back. We went to one other Cuban food place off of either Flamingo or Trop and it wasn't as good as this place. 

Give it a try and I bet you wont be disappointed"}
{"text":"Well what can I say Havana Grill is GREAT!!! I love the food, of course it's not like my mother-in-laws authentic Cuban food; but still the food is delicious."}
{"text":"Me and my friends go to Havana grill a lot and i must say the food is really good, very tasty, drinks are fabulous, great prices (mojitos are the best!)... service is great!... Fridays and saturdays they have music and it gets pretty crowded and the atmosphere its just perfect!
I recommend this place!
(eastern and the 215 next to the movie theater)"}
{"text":"This place was horrible. The food was dry and tasteless. The \"Cuban\" bread was plain white bread smashed in a press. We split an appetizer and a sandwich and they were both a joke. The meat was way overdone, dry, chewy, and way overpriced at $12. The papas were boxed mashed potatoes with a bland sausage in the middle. 2 potato balls for $6. The service was OK, but there is no \"legitimate \" reason this business should still be open. I will never return."}
{"text":"I can't say I have much experience with Cuban cuisine but I was very disappointing with this place after seeing all the positive reviews. Nothing was particularly good. The tortilla chips with our appetizer were those round yellow bargain shelf grocery store/school cafeteria chips, surprising to see in a nice-looking restaurant. The pork was dry and flavorless. I took most of it home and added sauce and made it taste a little better the next day.

I will say this place has a nice atmosphere and featured some live music while we were there. The service was good, too. But for me, food is 75% of the rating."}
{"text":"This place has never disappointed me. The food is exceptional and the black beans are on point. You have to try the Tostones the order is huge and I recommend the mini Cuban sandwich as an appetizer hits the spot and still allows room for the Arroz con pollo."}
{"text":"One star for being seated promptly. Ordered nachos and waited over 40 minutes. Never did anyone come by and day your order will be out soon. When the nachos came they were luke warn and had no guacamole per the menu. When we inquired about the guac they simply said their avocados weren't ready  (how about mentioning this when we ordered). They offered extra sour cream in lieu of and that was never brought out to us.  Won't be back to this place"}
{"text":"Mediocre food, very poor service.  We were at this restaurant on 07/17/11 for lunch and our food kept getting given to the table next to us.  We also ordered \"yuca con chicharrones\" only to be informed when the wrong dish came out that they were out of \"chicharrones\".  My food was served to my table before my wife's, this defeats the whole purpose of having lunch together.  Only after the waitress saw me writing this review on yelp in my phone did she bother to ask if everything was ok."}
{"text":"Went here last night with a party of 5. Food was very good, service was horrendous! We were sat in the furthest corner area, we had to chase servers down for refills, glasses were filled with the wrong drinks, I had to get up and ask for service a few times and ask for my check. Most of the dinner, we were completely ignored. We were sat in very close proximity to the kitchen and wait staff area, no reason for this bad of service. I left a very GOOD tip... \"Provide better service\" was the best \"tip\" that I could give them. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Second best Cuban food next to my moms. It has ben years since I have had Cuban food and while there the tastes and the smells as well as the conversation took me back in time when I was a young boy and family would gather.
Left very full and very happy. Amazing staff to compliment amazing food. Thank you"}
{"text":"My hubby and I love this place. The staff is fantastic- very attentive and entertaining. We had a party here on the patio and were amazed at how over and above they went to accommodate us. Great drinks, great food.... make sure you try the tres leches dessert!! So good!"}
{"text":"Three cheers for a good restaurant right next door to the movies! Yea!

We've been countless times, both for lunch and dinner and always enjoy a delicious meal. If you get there at the right time, there's live music as well.

On to the food! The Tostones are so good...smashed fried plaintains topped with either ground beef, shredded beef or shrimp. We always get the shrimp and they're always tender, crisp perfection. My favorite appetizer is the Papas Rellenas. I could eat these every day. They're a humble, comforting dish...mashed potatoes rolled into a ball with a surprise of seasoned ground beef hidden in the middle. They are then fried to a delicate brown on the outside and served with a crispy plaintain chip. This and a salad is lunch perfection for me! Also nice on the appetizer menu is a mini cuban sandwich when you just can't handle the big one. My kids always order it as the kids menu only has ham and cheese. The black bean soup is everything you want a black bean soup to be. The only salad I order is the Ensalada Havana...sliced green apples, oranges, cashews and chicken over greens with shaved manchego and a sweet vinaigrette...so good!
Let's see to the entrees... The traditional Cuban sandwich is exactly that. Traditional and perfect. The bread is crisp on the outside, soft on the inside with the right balance of pork, ham, cheese and pickle. Vaca Frita is seasoned, shredded, seared crispy, tender beef served with rice and black beans. Ropa Vieja, shredded beef in a savory tomato-y sauce. Too many good things here...the Bistecs are delicious as well. We've never made it to dessert...hopefully someday we'll taste their flan!"}
{"text":"A nice place for excellent food and a stunning service every time that I go there I love . I Do recommend my clients and they keep the same opinions ."}
{"text":"Really wanted to give this place 4 or 5 stars, but the only downside was the wait time for food. The servers are very friendly and attentive. Alejandra and Amber were both very nice. We ordered the Cuban sandwich, beef enchilada with beans, and plantain chips. It took 50 minutes for the food to come.Thank goodness we ordered chips and salsa first, I was really hungry! The atmosphere is really fun and relaxing. There is a dance floor and a place for live music. There was a party going on later they said, so that sounded cool. I would go back because the food was good and in hopes maybe I just got a night where the food coming out was slow. I've had their cocktails during the afternoon once and that was really good. Bartender was fast and nice. I recommend the Chocolo. It's rum, chocolate, and coconut! Yum!"}
{"text":"We called to reserve Havana Grill for June 24th, a Monday. As you can see the website shows open on Monday and it was confirmed for a party of 16 for that day. We all show up and it's closed and the sign says closed on Mondays. I had called a couple of days before to ask if I can bring a cake for our party that Monday and she said oh yes, she checked to add that to our party reservations. They lost out because another restaurant seated all of us for the party! I won't go back, unprofessional service."}
{"text":"Came here because friends found it on Yelp and wanted to try. We went for Sunday lunch and lucky us! Everything was 50% off. (I think the deal was 50% off everything Sunday-Tuesday or something like that.)

They started us off with bread - slickity buttery bread but oh so warm. They kept it coming too, which is always a plus in my book. I ordered something quite expensive - some pork dish marinated in citrus with yucca smothered in cheese. I couldn't taste the citrus-ness of the pork, the yucca was sooo good but really oily, and let's just say cold cheese isn't exactly tasty either. But pork was really tender, and the moros was delish. I tried some of my friends' foods and they were really good, so I probably just ordered wrong. They also had quite a bit of food for vegetarians (half of our group were vegetarians). Service was pretty prompt with the water and the \"how's everything going\" checking. Overall, I could really see myself going back here and giving it another try. Needless to say, the 50% off price didn't hurt either. =)"}
{"text":"I loved it! I am from Miami and so am very familiar with Cuban food! The food was very authentic and delicious while being very reasonably priced! The service was very good and the place was packed! I would definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"I love this place the Cuban food is so good and the people are so nice we dance all night long and had a blast we will always go there when I want to shake it."}
{"text":"Here's a few tips to the wise:
1.  Expect a longer wait time for your food to be served.  
2.  Do a take out order (they seem to have a higher priority) instead of dining in customers.
3.  I preferred the lunch menu which had more variety and a few bucks cheaper than dinner menu.  No pork chops (excellent lunch) are on the dinner menu!
4.  One really bad moment - we order a beef nacho platter as an appetizer which doesn't show up until after our dinners were served!  
5.  The food is flavorful, not spicy but the main dish portions are small.

I've eaten  lunch and dinner there twice.........probably won't go back there!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing. I love the music if course. I can't wait to go back when the band is there. I want to try everything on the menu. The staff makes sure your cup is never empty."}
{"text":"The new bar food menu additions are great: try the shrimp-stuffed avocado or the meatballs with guava BBQ sauce! Plus Carlos makes the BEST Sangria! 

Food has always been good here -  we've been visiting for years - but it seems to have gotten even better lately, especially the Masitas which is the perfect combination of crispy on the outside and tender in the middle. Yum!"}
{"text":"Excellent lemon drop excellent Ceviche app excellent salmon black beans and rice great food"}
{"text":"As I moved here from FL, where I am accustomed to excellent Cuban food, I tried to be as neutral as possible when reviewing this restaurant.  I ordered my old favorite, Vaca Frita, with Moro and a side of Maduros since the plates don't come with Maduros.  The Vaca Frita was extremely fatty and the Maduros were so scorched, I was trying to peel off the black parts to get to the sweet plantain portion, but they were not salvageable.  The restaurant looked clean and the staff was friendly so I may try this place one more time to give it a fair shake (will order the Lechon Asado/Pork instead though) so let's see what happens on try #2....for try #1, and for the drive I took to get there, I was not impressed."}
{"text":"Went here with a groupon (yes i'm addicted). Loved the atmosphere & decor. The food was really delicious. My first time having Cuban food. I had the beef ropa vieja (shredded beef simmered with tomatoes, peppers & onions) It was tender and flavorful. My boyfriend had the beef Vaca Frita, which was also very flavorful but a bit dry (didnt stop him from eating it all though). Both were served with white rice and red beans which were a nice accompaniment. We both had one of their specialty cocktails. They were very tasty & fruity & STRONG :D We were not disappointed in the food & service and will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"This is my second favorite restaurant in town, and rates in my all time top ten! The did is excellent. The staff is nice. Three ambience makes you feel like you're out someplace special and the live music on the weekends is great fun. You just have to check this place out."}
{"text":"Wonderful food.  I highly recommend the Arroz Con Pollo and the Garbanzos.  Very friendly staff.  A little pricier than expected, but worth it.  It was worth the drive from West Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Just went back for another visit and, of course, the food was on par! They even brought in a new chef who I had the pleasure of meeting and chated with for awhile. He's from Miami and is very particular about his black beans. This dude is gonna make some serious changes to the place and I'm looking forward to it!"}
{"text":"This place was my first experience eating cuban food.  I had a groupon with me when I visited Havana Grill.  I like the ambiance in the restaurant, it looks quiet and it looks like it can get exciting at any time.  I remmeber eating a pork sandwich, it wasn't flavorful so don't think I will order that again.  My husband had the chicken with Rice, it was hot and but it wasn't great.  I'm not a food guru, it's just that this place is not my genre of food that I would like to eat again."}
{"text":"My friends and I went here on a Friday night to grab some dinner and dance salsa.  We are all professional salsa dancers.  When we walked into the restaurant, the DJ/owner barked at us to \"make sure you check in on Facebook so you get a free drink!\"  We were told by the hostess to choose a table, and when we did were informed it was \"reserved\".  When we finally got service, we asked for water initially, and she brought over bottled water.  I told her we just wanted regular tap water, and she said \"we don't serve that.\"  I told her I didn't want to pay for bottled water and she nastily informed me \"it's already open\", and set it down on the table.  I looked behind me at other tables, and they had regular glasses of water with lemon!  After ignoring our table, we had to seek out the manager for service to order our dinner.  In the midst of the discussion, the waitress who had forced the bottled water on us came over with the bill - two bottled waters at $4 apiece!  I told her we wanted to order dinner.  We finally got a server change after speaking with the manager, and few comped drinks, but it didn't make up for the service.  After all the nonsense, the DJ/owner insisted on taking a bunch of photos with us for his promo material.  Ugh.

Beware of the check - they include the tip in the bill regardless of the amount, and if you ask for change, they will short you the coinage.

In summary, out of 10, being highest:

Food - 6.5 (blander than other Cuban style restaurants, but still decent)
DJ - 4 (5 merengue songs in a row)
Service - 0

Just don't go."}
{"text":"Food was great, service not great.  If it was better I would have given 5 stars. So called manager walks around but doesn't help to improve the quality of the service. Experience would have been much better if he did.."}
{"text":"The best Cuban food in town!!! Very authentic!! Excellent service, the owner is always greeting the customers.  I reccomend it to anybody who likes caribbean food."}
{"text":"salsa!!!! I love salsa and the salsa nights are awesome here, the food is ok and the restaurant is nice"}
{"text":"The food is OK but portions are small and VERY 
expensive when compared to the more friendly
priced Carlito's Cuban Food and El Tinajon. DO
NOT take my word, just check it out yourself and
decide if you agree or not. Sodas are $3 @ Havana
Grill vs. $1 at both named alternatives, for example."}
{"text":"The waitress was really nice and knowledgeable.  The food I had was really good. And after 930 they had salsa dancing on Friday night."}
{"text":"I was a Cuban stuck in Vegas due to a storm.  A friend easily cheered me up by taking me to a place that prepared dishes like my grandmother, perhaps because its mostly Cuban staff with owner onsite.  Great palomilla steak and tostones.   Mojitos excellent mixed in classic island style.  get the appetizer plate with drinks for sure.  

Hasta la proxima!"}
{"text":"Happy hour food and drink are tasty. The bartenders are nice. The sangria is the best I've had in Vegas."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Great food and the service!!! CARLI and ALI at the bar.  The best chicharrones in town."}
{"text":"Honestly I have eaten here about 3 times and I cannot remember what I ate. Yes, it is that memorable. But the Cuban coffee is fantastic, so if that's what you are looking for, here it is! I give it  three stars for the coffee."}
{"text":"Wanted to have a meal close to home and decided to try this place on someone's recommendation. Severely dissapointed!
I was debating what chicken to try, in my quest to eat high protein, and the server suggested that the pollo a la planchia was really good. I took her recommendation and decided to order this. The chicken breasts were pounded and marinated and grilled. I found the chicken to be too oily and also the onions that came as a garnish to be very oily. Since it took over 20 min, for us to get our order, and the entrees were priced at $14 I think, I expected more. Instead of rice, I asked for a salad which they got-lettuce, tomatoes without any dressing. This came with a side of beans in a smallish bowl and I took 1 bite as I did not like the way it tasted and looked. I asked for hot salsa and got 2 bottles of chilli sauce.

D had the Havana Grill Pollo Salteado which came with rice and beans. It was ok. The serving was quite big but lacking in flavor.

The positive was the server who greeted us promptly and brought glasses of iced water and some bread. Even though it was not too busy, they took long bringing out the food, and then bringing the check as well.

I will not be going back."}
{"text":"Moved here from Florida, and have been seriously missing some Cuban food.  So glad I found this place!  Service was great, food was delicious and we will be back!"}
{"text":"I went with my gf and another couple for some late night drinks and salsa dancing (w. a DJ). It was a good time but the dance floor was kind of small. And the music was deafening but besides that we had a good time. Beer was $6 for a budlight which is kind of pricey for the venue. Would go again for dancing. I haven't experienced the live music yet."}
{"text":"Vaca frita de pollo or bistec are delicious. Good rum drinks. Paella really good. My wife has a friend who is Cuban and him and his family swear by this restaurant. Definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"The service was awesome and the food was delicious. I've frequented a lot of amazing Cuban restaurants in Miami and Havana Grill reminded me of a few of them. I always order churrasco, white rice, moros, Maduros, and tostones. Everything we got was wonderful. We came here for my birthday on a Friday night and were actually surprised that it wasn't more crowded. If the restaurant wasn't on the opposite side of town, I would be here all the time!"}
{"text":"Avoid if you want value for your money OR you just like rice.
The portions are INCREDIBLY small for the amount of money you pay. 

My wife is Cuban and besides being completely unimpressed with the quality of the food, was absolutely livid at the tiny portions.  We took one portion home without touching it, just to measure, and it was less than a pound of food for 14$.  The dessert was the same 'quality', it was tres leches and about the size of an infants fist for 6$.

We will actively tell people to avoid this horrible place."}
{"text":"We arrived really excited to have some delicious Cuban food and aside from taking our drink order the staff ignored us for 20 minutes. The customers who arrived after us were being served appetizers and getting their second border from the bar by the time I finally stopped a server asking that she please not pass by us again. A server arrived and informed me that she would be waiting on us and that she had not been informed by the hostess that we were \"her table \" . I left a five dollar bill on the table to pay for our beverages and informed the server that we were no longer interested in dining with them. As I left I asked the hostess why she failed to inform the server that we would be \"her table \"and she called the server a liar."}
{"text":"Used to go to this place at least once a month for the last 5 years.. Loved their menu and the different flavors it was always a great experience,last Friday I decided to visit after a couple of months of absence and to my surprise the awesome taste that always distinguish their meat is nowhere to be found... Everything from the meat to the tostones lacked flavor; I asked the waitress if the restaurant had changed management but she said that no that everything was the same as before. So I'm sorry to say that I won't be coming back for a while even the leftovers ended up in the trash which in my house is extremely rare."}
{"text":"Went in for lunch... Food was wonderful, very reasonably priced, cocktails amazing...service was outstanding!!!!   Definitely returning.."}
{"text":"Slow service at any time of the day, independently if the place is full or empty. Not worth the wait."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! I will definitely be going there again. The people are very friendly and the drinks are very yummy."}
{"text":"I give 5 Estrellas because of the service and delicious food. El lechon asado with rice and black beans (moros y cristíanos) was awesome. The tostones with garlic dipping sauce was to die for. El Mojito and Cuban cafe closed it off with Cuban style. Too bad I live in Hawaii but I will return again!"}
{"text":"We stopped in here after going to the movies one evening and got a Cuban Sandwich.  It was pretty tasty, so we came back a week or so later.

When you first get it, it seems like a great place.  Nice atmosphere, lively, etc...

It was a Friday night around 7:30-8pm.  It was busy, but definitely not packed.  The whole other side of the restaurant was empty.  Needless to say, our waitress was slow. Not really around very much.  We ordered two mojitos and it took 10 minutes to get them.  Meanwhile there were 3 bartenders who were not that busy.  Finally got the drinks and ordered.

The Tostones Camerones were pretty good considering they were smothered in cheese.  Anything is good smothered in cheese.

I ordered the Vaca Frita.  The description was a flank steak marinated in their mojo sauce with rice and beans.  I was thinking the steak would be tender.  Not so.  It was a plate of dried out, burned shredded up steak.  Had absolutely no flavor.  The rice was fine, but its rice.  Hard to mess up.

My husband got a chicken breast that was covered in onions and a side of white rice and beans.  It was good, but NOTHING SPECIAL.

I guess what Im trying to say is that this place is nothing special, although you might think so when you first walk in.  It's super overpriced for what you get.  I will probably never go there again.  

If you go, just get an appetizer and the cuban."}
{"text":"I always get this Arroz con Pollo that falls right off of the bone & melts in your mouth w/ the yellow rice.  The portions are so large that I split it & another dish w/ friends.  

Tonight, Carlito was fantastic at the bar.  My first time sitting up here.  I also just read that Grubhub delivers from Havana Grill!  

One night I will have to come back for live music.  I've been coming here for years & saying the same thing.  Will do it soon.  Also it's a great place to stop before or after a movie, since Regal theater is located next door."}
{"text":"Early dinner there last night.  Never had Cuban food wanted to try it.  Both had the cuban sandwich...1 pork, 1 chicken.  We were both unimpressed.  Bread, meat(not very seasoned) carmalized onions...that's it.  Maybe that's what the Cuban sandwich is suppose to be, so I wont complain about the food.  

We were seated quickly but it took quite a few minutes to see a waiter which was fine although it was not busy at all. 3 wait staff  8 tables seated.   It gave us time to decide what to get..  Initially the waiter was great took our drink order and explained how to say our selection in the native tongue.  Food and drinks were served in decent time.  That was the last time we saw our or any other waiter unitl I pressed the host for our check.  We were there for a total of 50 minutes.  I'm guessing we would have had 3 or 4 more drinks...maybe dessert.  This was probably the most unattentative staff at a restaurant that I've ever been to.   I look forward to trying Cuban food again, just not HERE.  Sorry"}
{"text":"Excelente lugar para compartir con la familia 
El servicio y la comida fue excelente 
Me encanto 
Sin duda alguna volveré a ir y se los recomiendo"}
{"text":"Just got done with lunch here.  This is the thired time that I have been here.  we go because we love Cuban food, but I do not think that I have ever had what I would consider to be a good \"Cuban Meal\" here.  Today I ordered the Bistec de Palomilla.  The meat was either under seasoned or not seasoned at all.  It came to the table, \"just warm\" covered in onions. It seemes that a dish like this should come with chimichurri sauce.  I also ordered the Mariquitas, which is thin sliced fried plantains.  These came out cold, like they have been made hours ago and just put onto a plate.  I have had these in several places before where they come out piping hot, fresh, and amazinly good....but not here.  I have to tell you that the best and freshest thing that was on my plate seemed to be the white rice."}
{"text":"This place is horrible.  I don't know how they stay in business.  We had to wait forever to be seated - no it was not busy and when we were finally seated it was a dirty table.  We waited 15 minutes and nothing.  No water, no \"I'll be right with you\" - nothing.  We walked out and no one even noticed.  I then tried to call to tell them how shitty they are and they didn't even answer the phone.  Thus previously happened but my daughter wanted to give them another chance.  FAIL! FAIL! FAIL!  Scratch this one off your list."}
{"text":"Best Cuban restaurant I've tried in all of Vegas. Customer service was amazing and the food was truly authentic!"}
{"text":"Not very friendly,  n food is not good.  The restaurant itself looks nice,  u can tell they spent money on building it.... but when the service AND food isn't good,  it's a fail. At least 1/2 shld be good.  My family/friends n I wont be coming here again."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed eating at the restaurant but both times I've ordered delivery from this place I've been severely disappointed and will not be frequenting this place any longer. 

Last time our salad didn't have any dressing among other mistakes and this time both items I bought didn't come with the sauce listed on the menu. When I called to complain they said that they had run out of the sauce and that the sauce was free so they didn't charge me for it. 

All it would have taken was for someone to notify me that the sauce was out and I would have ordered something different.   I don't care about the cost of the sauce. I would pay for not free sauce. 

In the end both the delivery company and this restaurant did not take responsibility for what is basically the equivalent of two dry meat salads with no sauce that I am unable to eat and had to pay $40 for.  

I'm very disappointed and bummed out because normally I really love the food here and actually tried to introduce a friend to this place but since the food is basically inedible it's a terrible introduction."}
{"text":"Wonderful ambiance, fabulous food, and welcoming staff. If you're craving authentic Cuban cuisine, you won't be disappointed! Definitely will return!"}
{"text":"Place was very nice and food is decent. My Abuelito is Cubano so sadly this was not as delicious as the homemade food I grew up on but it was pretty good. The mamey shake was very good and presentation of the food was good. The water was very good too (not tap). We had pan con bistec and pan con pollo both good. I was missing the Cubano au jus but overall pleased with the experience and the staff was great."}
{"text":"If you are looking for good authentic Cuban food, this is the place. I was raised in Miami, and I occasionally get home sick and crave good Cuban food! I have been to all the Cuban restaurants in town -  this is my favorite!

If you want a sampling of a Cuban sandwich with their mariquitas, which are fried thin green plantains, I recommend the appetizer Mini Cuban Sandwich. It has tender roasted sliced port, ham, cheese, pickles, with mustard. Then it is pressed on a grill. Don't get the fries - try the plantains in their mojo garlic lemon sauce.

For my entree' I had the Lechon Al Despelote, which is chunks of roasted leg of pork served on fried yuca and topped with melted cheese.  There are three small servings of pork/yucca to this order with your choice of black beans and rice (more wet with rice and beans served separately) or Moros Y Christianos (black beans & white rice cooked together) for a more dry helping of black beans and rice.  I prefer the separate order so it is moist when I combine them. This was an excellent meal even though the portion of pork/yucca is very small. The cost is $16.00.

He had the Palomilla Empanizada, which is the sirloin steak that is thinly sliced and breaded. It is topped with grilled onions. He really enjoyed this. One of my favorites is the Bistec De Palomilla, which is similar to his order above except it is not breaded. Both come with the same selection of rice/beans and are also priced at $16.00.

Other items I enjoy from Havana Grill are their Plantains Maduros, which are fried sweet, ripe caramelized plantains. I don't always have room for dessert, but I do enjoy both the Flan Cubano (caramel custard) and the Cake De Tres Leches (white cake/three in three milks).

The restaurant is beautiful. I love the decor and flowers. It has a nightclub, which is awesome entertainment on weekends. They have also added outdoor seating recently. 

Our server this time was Gabriel. Excellent service!"}
{"text":"The service was fantastic! Food great. Some healthy options available. I would love more vegetarian choices
Herman was fabulous!!!"}
{"text":"Dear Yelpers you have led me astray... This place was no where near as great as everyone said it would be and for the money I spent I was expecting great Cuban food. I had the loma saltado and it was supposed to come with papas and to my amazement there weren't any, not to mention the food to me was bland and I could not taste not smell any garlic and where is the cilantro? I've had my share of Cuban and Puerto Rican food and I must say I was not impressed not even a little..... It will be a long time before I return."}
{"text":"La comida y el servicio excelente, buen ambiente, mi lugar preferido.para disfrutar en familia, con su especial mojito"}
{"text":"This is the closest place to real Cuban cuisine out here in Vegas. I'm Cuban from Miami and when I don't want to cook my own Cuban food, I come here. My favorites are: pan con bistec, lechón asado, & ropa vieja..."}
{"text":"I'd give a six star if they had one, the food is delicious and their espresso rocks! Had their 8.99 lunch special, so worth the price. Definitely coming back again when I'm on the south side of town"}
{"text":"I may be biased being Latin but Havana Grill has got it going on in the realm of Latin grub! La Mezcla de Aperitivos (Mixed Plate of Appetizers) is a great place to start if you are not familiar with their menu items, providing you with a great spread of items to try out. 

I would say the two most common Cuban items on the menu would be the cuban sandwich and paella. Their paella is just okay imo. Things that they have that are amazing are...tamal de maiz cubano, papas rellenas and my all time favorite masitas de puerco fritas but make sure to dip them in the vinegar!

The sangria and their mojitos are definitely a MUST but don't waste any time, just order it by the pitcher b/c it'll save you a few bucks in the end.

The tab can add up fast so we like to visit during their happy hour (4-7p daily, I believe) bringing you select discounted appetizers and half price pitchers of mojitos and sangria as well as other drink discounts which is definitely worth the trip!"}
{"text":"Decided to try this place due to a groupon purchase.  Ate here on a Saturday night.

Food- Ordered the plantains as an appetizer. It was subpar- I've had plantains  that taste the exact same way at the EDR (employee dining room) for FREE..!

Entrees- we ordered pan con bistec with banana chips & lechon asado. Again, both dishes were nothing out of the ordinary and both on the dry side. I felt the pan con bistec could have used some kind of sauce. The presentation of the lechon asado did not make the dish look appetizing. And when we cut into the pork, it was so dry. Thank goodness for the black beans, which we mixed with the white rice & pork to make the meal somewhat edible. 

Atmosphere - it was a bit dark in the restaurant. They were about to set up  for late night music / DJ.

Service - not bad, not great.

Overall - I don't think i will be coming back here."}
{"text":"We celebrated my husbands birthday lastnight there the staff was very friendly and the food was delicious. We had 16 people and the bill was very reasonable. We stayed longer to enjoy the DJ and do some dancing. Would definietly go back."}
{"text":"The food was delicious and authentic! My kids loved the choices on the kids menu and they even got a fancy ice cream desert. The best part was the service, our server was absolutely fabulous she made our night. This was was my first yelp and it was all because of her- we will be back very soon!"}
{"text":"I have been coming here for about three years now since it is right next to the movie theater. I have eaten there twice and each time I was pleased with the meal. I actually don't really remember what I had there since it's been a while but I know I had no complaints. When I come here it is mainly for the mojitos. I enjoy them tremendously, however I am not some mojito connoisseur or snob.... they are just delicious, refreshing drinks and this place offered the best and reasonably priced. The staff is nice and it isn't unheard of to get a free drink or two if you're ordering drinks and having a good time. I will continue to frequent Havana Grill."}
{"text":"I love this place! Fast, friendly service & a variety of choices on the menu! I was in a hurry so I ordered to-go ...had a hair appt next door! First time there ..I had the Ropas Viejas Pollo ...sooo good & comes w/bread!  I forgot to take a photo! Nice atmosphere & friendly staff!"}
{"text":"So last time really enjoyed this place and the food was great. At the encouragement of the waiter, tried the Havana Bistec Salteado. Big disappointment. The meat was about as tough as it can get and I was worn out just trying to chew through  it. It won't stop me from going back, but not for that one."}
{"text":"Tonight we are here and not only was it amazing but the service was impeccable. Our server, Romilio was the kindest server we have genuinely ever had. Our food was running a little long but he was always by our side making sure we were fine and even gave us an absolutely amazing chicken soup obviously made from scratch. And I'm so happy he did because I would have never tried it but now we'll be ordering it with every meal. I will always come back and tell everyone I know to come here. Ps, always get the Lechon Asado it's phenomenal"}
{"text":"The food wasn't great. I would've gotten better at any hole in the wall Mexican joint. We've been to this spot about a handful of times,each time we're reminded why we hadn't been back . The service is typically mediocre at best, this last visit was a straight up fail. I'll give it another 6 months before I try it again, maybe by then the food and service will have improved..."}
{"text":"This is a very nice restaurant and latin night club. The food is excelent, and so is the service. On weekends we have had so much fun, dacing to latin music. Great place to eat, and have fun."}
{"text":"Food was delicious but I can't say much for the service. We've sat unattended to for over 20mins. The restaurant was not busy when my gf and I went. We ended up going to the server for to go boxes and for the check."}
{"text":"The food is EXPENSIVE and NOT WORTH IT. The service was unpleasant, slow, our server only showed up if we hunted him down. I've never paid so much for a margarita, $15 and it was small and unflavored. The food was okay, but almost $20 per plate and not satisfying enough. Horrible! I left this place HUNGRY. Horrible place."}
{"text":"Great Cuban food.  Service is uneven and there are often long waits for food."}
{"text":"Plantain chips were delish!
Pineapple mojitos are a must!!!!
Pork we got was dry. Would only go for drinks and apps next time due to over priced food and lack of quality."}
{"text":"Oh My Gosh!!! I don't know where to begin...
We had my daughter's quinceanera here and it was beyond amazing!!! The owner/manager Lucia went above and beyond to make this the most amazing party ever. Her professionalism and attention to detail was second to none. I had people coming to me all night telling me how delicious the food was. Their food is always great so I had no doubt it would be good. But we had a buffet and the food was fresh and replenished and the wait staff were friendly and attentive to all of my guests. Even though they had another large party in the other part of the restaurant, our service was not in the least bit lacking.
Now...about the DJ! DJ Crazy was OFF THE HOOK!!! The mix kept everyone from the 15 year olds to the 50+ year olds dancing and partying the night away. He took my pictures that I had incorrectly formatted and turned them into a beautiful presentation that did not leave a dry eye in the house. 
I literally had someone tell me it was the most amazing and fun party she had ever attended.
If you are looking for the best venue in town with the best entertainment, the most delicious food and the highest professional and friendly staff in town, do yourself a favor and go see Lucia at Havana Grill.
Thank you for making my daughter's special day go off without a hitch."}
{"text":"The happy hour deals were great! My husband and I shared the sampler and it was very good. The tamale was my husband's favorite and the croquetas, papas rellenas, and cuban sandwich were also yummy. The lechon asado was truly divine and some of the best pork we have ever eaten! The prices are a bit more than we would like, but we will be back! The wait staff was also very good and considerate when we mentioned we were on our way to the movies after dinner. Definitely a great experience!"}
{"text":"Always a good time, great food and atmosphere! Everything we have tried on the menu is as true as you can get to Cuba authentic food! All the mojitos are amazing! Highly recommend trying this place!"}
{"text":"Vegetarian meal was sooo good. Delicious fried sweet plantains! Excellent service and meal"}
{"text":"Stopped in at Havana Grill for lunch this past weekend. It made high marks for simple and flavorful food, friendly service and a pleasant atmosphere. We started with the Papas Rellenas, which were surprisingly flavorful, even with the heavy potato on the outside. 

I ordered the Pollo A La Plancha as my entrée, which was basic but delicious. The onions were cooked just enough to take out the bite but still remain a little crisp, the chicken was moist, and the black beans and rice were the perfect compliment. 

I definitely plan on going back soon. Especially since Happy Hour is 4-9 PM every day!"}
{"text":"Such excellent service along with a great Cuban sandwich and chicken sandwich makes it a come back with others!!"}
{"text":"Great lunch time specials, although they will generally run from $10-$15. The food tasted authentic. The portion sizes are what you'd expect for the price. I think I'll likely be coming back here :)"}
{"text":"This place used to be delicious, sorry to say the food is not to par. I got Moros and Christianos and it tasted dry and old. So did their masas de puerco , in minutes it was cold like yesterday's leftover. 
The waitress would not change a side order, so I got their soggy yuca!
Never again is too much."}
{"text":"Food is great, really big portions, everything on the menu is really authentic cuban food, drinks are awesome. At night it turns into a Latin club which is great for dancing and learning to dance to all the different types of latin music. Table specials are very reasonable on friday and saturday nights Overall a good place to go eat and an awesome place to go spend your staurday night."}
{"text":"THE BEST CUBAN FOOD WE'VE HAD IN A LONG TIME! I got the lechon asado and my wife got the Cuban sandwich. Topped it off with a Cuban coffee and flan. Everything was absolutely delicious and we will definitely be back. 

There was a baby shower going on at the same time and the Cuban music had the place rocking. It felt like we were back in Florida.

We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Very nice service, but the food was too dry... and no sauces (except a bottled brand that was way too hot!)  The menu is VERY limited...  the appetizers were mini helpings of the limited entrees!  (Ordered appetizers, then went to entree section, and it was the SAME dishes!) 
Very dry food... will not go back."}
{"text":"Alright, as I sit here, leftovers depleted.  I long for the Havana Grill. 

The Cuban sandwiches flavor intensified after a stay in the fridge. The Bistecca and Frijoles Negros , more complex.

My greatest regret is that this place is so far across town, because I'd be there now...."}
{"text":"So yum! This is a spot in a strip mall that's easy to overlook. But don't do that. You should go eat here. It's quite delicious. Service is pleasant, friendly, and attentive. Ambiance and decor are nice. Music and dancing heat up late at night. There's an outdoor seating area where you might be serenaded by a mariachi band. The mojitos are fab. The menu is fairly lengthy with lots of options. It was really difficult for me to decide on just one entree. I finally settled on the Palomilla Empanizada. It was so delicious! Big portion, very filling. It reminded me of all the little places I ate while visiting Little Havana in Miami. So good! I'm definitely a fan."}
{"text":"Muy mal servicio, nos tomo 2 hrs para recivir nuestra , y luego el manager agresivo.  Y la comida  no estaba tan buena tampoco."}
{"text":"Not my favorite. I didn't really know what to expect in Cuban food, but I do know that I had it one memorable time at Cha Cha Cha in Haight -Ashbury, San Francisco, so I was excited to see a fun looking Cuban restaurant near my new place. However, it was a little bit bland for my liking, literally lacking in taste. I could see potential for the atmosphere being fun with mojitos and dancing in the late hours, but it's a no for dinner. I had the \"camarones al ajillo\" which are large prawns sauteed in olive oil, garlic, and white wine. Didn't taste like anything I couldn't make myself.  My date ordered \"lechon asado\" which was a slow-roasted pork dish, but again totally lacking in flavor, with just a boring side of rice and beans. My favorite was the cuban sandwich appetizer with plantain chips, tasty, but not something I've been craving ever since. Sorry Havana Grill, you have yet to impress"}
{"text":"I really want to love Havana Grill.  It's a small Cuban restaurant with a friendly staff and good bartenders, but the food is . . . well, it's just okay. 

I've been there a few times and I've tried out the croquetas (deep fried ball with ham filling) , Sandwich Cubano (pork, ham, and cheese with dill pickles on a bun), tostones (fried plantains) and arroz con pollo (Cuban classic roasted chicken with yellow rice).  Just listing out those items, I keep wondering why the food isn't a slam dunk--I mean, I said \"fried\" several times, right?  Well, somehow the food is consistently under-seasoned.  Every time I've ordered the tostones, I feel like I dump the entire salt shaker on them to provide some flavoring.  And I haven't been impressed by any of the other dishes either, they all just felt flat.  The only dish I would rave about is the side dish of yellow rice, which really was wonderful.  

Now my understanding is that Havana Grill is the sister restaurant of Florida Cafe (a Cuban restaurant on Vegas Blvd in downtown Vegas).  And that's odd because I've never had a problem with seasoning there.  At the end of the day, the food at Havana Cafe ranged between 2.5 stars and 3. 

But I've also been here for happy hour and this is a great spot for drinks with friends.  The bartenders make an exceptional mojito and they are on their game and attentive no matter how full the bar gets.  I've brought a few people here for the happy hour deals and every one has left happy.  4 stars for the bar and the friendly bartenders.   

So the place rounds out to 3-3.5 stars based on the great bar and the not so amazing food."}
{"text":"My hubby and I decided to stop here for a bite before catching a flick at Colonnade next door. We didn't want to fill up too much before the movies , what were we thinking stopping here first? This place has good Cuban fare with a range of six different flavored mojito's to wet yer whistle . We ordered a few scrumptious appetizers , one being Tostones which are green fried plantains with camarones or shrimp, shredded and ground beef. These were different but delicious with a tomatillo salsa on top . I chose the chorizo Frito which was spicy Spanish fried sausage. We thought we might want more so we decided to have the Sopa de pollo, which is a delightful version of chicken soup , with potatoes and fresh squeezed lemon , I have had this before and wish I could take home containers of it every time I feel a hangover coming on . I mean I have had cravings for it ! There is a zesty spice to it that is amazing. Needless to say we pushed the limit leaving little to no room for crappy movie food. But what can I say my taste buds are growing a bit more refined. Love this place which is the sister to Florida cafe on Las Vegas boulevard. This place is great for a quick bite or large groups wanting to party , you will get a great buzz and want to salsa In your seat!"}
{"text":"During my experience there, the food was average, but the service was miserable. We easily spent 2 hours getting through our dining experience and our server forgot our drinks multiple times. Im guessing she forgot to put in our order as well because multiple new tables were served before we ever got our food. Came here initially for a paint party and had a pretty good Cuban sandwich, but the service and proce dont make it worth it at all."}
{"text":"Great, authentic Cuban food. Good appetizer selections, none of which disappoint. My favorite entrees are the Masas De Puerco Fritas and the Arroz Con Pollo. They have really god sandwiches- definitely get them with the plantain chips. They apparently have a Cuban/Mexican Fusion Menu but I have not tried that, I have only had the Cuban dishes. Grab a mojito while you are there- cool and refreshing!"}
{"text":"Going off the strip in Vegas, you'll find a lot of restaurants especially in the same complex as Havana Grill.  There is apparently life outside of Vegas.  Naive me!  In this complex, there are restaurants that offer Lebanese, Vietnamese, Chinese, and other cuisines, especially Cuban.  We decided to go Cuban and what a find this place is!

I ordered number #73, which is some chicken dish topped with caramelized onions, served with moros (rice combined with black beans).  I ordered this because I looked around and saw a rice and chicken dish and since my wife was ordering the chicken & rice dish, I didn't want to order the same thing.  I was glad I ordered this one because this is a very very good dish.  The chicken was very flavorful and tender.  The rice mixed with black beans is a unique dish and has excellent flavor.

The arroz con pollo (chicken with rice) dish however, was a major disappointment.  The chicken was hidden underneath all the rice and was flavorless.  The rice, although flavorless, kinda grows on you, but that's not really a positive.  The only good thing from the dish was their platanos or fried plantains.

The atmosphere was great and the service was excellent.  The lovely waitress, Alejandra was ultra attentive and nice.  We would definitely consider coming back."}
{"text":"We went tonight 01/12/18 at approximately 8:10 p.m. and were seated quickly. They were barely busy.  We waited 25 minutes and only got water served to us by the kind bus boy (the only one that actually works there- every time we go there he is the ONLY ONE working his ass off). At no point were we acknowledged, asked for our drink or meal  orders or received the bread they serve by our waitress. The dyed blonde waitress walked past us several times and did not acknowledge us at any point. We left upset without being served. At no point did she ever make any contact with us even though she clearly saw us. We did receive a hair flip (note the sarcasm). When we left upset at waiting so long the hostess that knew we never got served said  \"Thank you.\" Seriously?!?! As a Cuban and patron I am embarrassed of their lack of running a business and assisting customers. Not the first time we have had to wait to be served timely here by the same airhead waitress. They have officially lost our family's business. Tonight they lost almost $150+ of business from our party. We tried flagging down the same waitress several times and she completely  ignored us each time. I would give zero stars but it is not an option. Que mierda!"}
{"text":"I'm so full I don't know what to do. 
I just ate more than I should have. Luckily it was so good, and really pretty healthy that I don't feel so bad. I got the pounded chicken with lemon and other yummy spices. With an appitizer of little mini cuban sammies and it was a meal. 
Then I just couldn't pass up a bite of homemade flan. Now you know what kind of horror I'm in for. 
Ugh, oh well it was so amazing that I can't wait to go back to have some more of that yummy smashed bread and another mojito and try another entree. 
SO YUMMY!!!!!"}

{"text":"Great authentic yummy food! Coming from the east coast where there's more options for Latin Caribbean food, this is your best bet for Las Vegas. I recommend the Pollo a la plancha (grilled chicken breast) with arroz blanco con abucheas rojas And maduros.   The severs are friendly and they also have take out which is convenient. Best Cuban spot in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"Had late lunch here yesterday. The restaurant was a bit dirty..weird food pieces on the floor near our table, waitress was very slow and not bright or attentive at all, and there was only one other couple dining in the restaurant .. the food was pretty good tho. We ordered arroz con pollo, chicken tenders, plantain appetizer, and the salmon. Three stars is for the food, if they could clean up the restaurant and get some better wait staff I'd give it 4 stars."}
{"text":"Very good food.  I enjoyed the environment and the exceptional wait staff.  One of Las Vegas nicest Cuban restaurants."}
{"text":"We had to go somewhere for Noche Buena (Christmas Eve).  I needed my roasted port fix.  So I brought the family here.  The food is good, not excellent, but I haven't found an excellent Cuban Restaurant in town, yet.

Black beans were good.  Pork was good.  Cuba Libré was good.  Atmosphere is good.  Service was very good.  

My wife had chicken ropa vieja (which was interesting as this should be a beef dish).  It was ok.  

My son had a Cuban Sandwich.  It was good.

It's all good, but it is missing something.  Not sure what.  But I am a native Miamian born to Cuban parents.  But, when you want a Cuban food fix, you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"This place is always a hit. I love the mojitos. Every dish I order is great."}
{"text":"Great food friendly staff and on the weekends great latin music Fridays and Saturdays from 10 PM until the sun is out..."}
{"text":"This restaurant is cool! We haven't had Cuban food before but they offer plates that are Cuban-Mexican as well. I had a white sangria to start and order steak sandwich and husband got the cuban. The service was wonderful and I really liked the atmosphere here it was quiet and the employees were smiling the whole time. Both of the sandwiches were amazing. Came cooked perfectly and everything came out quick. We will be back again. Thank you! BELINDA WAS SO SWEET!"}
{"text":"Best Cuban food I've had since I was in New York! The live band on Saturday is amazing and the DJ when they take a break keeps the partying going. Definitely recommend it! Also the mojito for $20 was great along with the bar drinks! Not expensive and the people are amazing!"}
{"text":"We were in the mood for a good  \"medianoche sandwich\" which is usually all pork. It used to be on menu of their sister restaurant Florida Cafe. We were being lazy and didn't want to travel all the way downtown from Henderson to our favorite PR Express. We ordered their version which was called \"Pan con lechon\" or something and it was horrible. The bread was not pressed long enough so my sandwich became soggy quick. The meat was tasteless and instead of having nice slices of pernil, they had these huge chunk of pork inside, kinda like carnitas. We bought 2 sandwiches at $12.00 each and had to throw both of them away! The quality of their food has gone down. I used to eat here alot but there are now other alternative to get my PR fix. I should have taken the food back and got our money back! Expensive and tasteless. What a shame."}
{"text":"Despite a deeply held belief that no one makes black beans and rice as tasty as the Cubans do, I hadn't stepped foot in a Cuban restaurant in years. Decades, actually. As a vegetarian, there are usually more diverse options calling my name.

But this past Saturday we went to Havana Grill because a) it's right next to a movie theatre that's never too crowded/miserable on the weekends, and b) my Aussie husband needed to try Cuban food before we all ditch Vegas for the wilds of Perth where, if they can't do Mexican without cracking open a bag of Tostitos and a block of cheddar, I'm pretty sure decent Cuban food is just as unlikely.

HG ended up being a solid four stars for me. I'm docking a star mostly because I felt like the black beans - while expertly prepared to dissolve in my mouth - were bland. I wasn't expecting heat, just at least some subtle layers of spice. Also, I really prefer that my main course not be brought out when I'm barely halfway through my salad (which I felt was overpriced despite its amazingness, see below).

The vegetarian choices for main dishes at Havana Grill are puny, but that's just Cuban cuisine wherever you go. I appreciate that the restaurant even offers vegetarian beans and makes a point of listing vegetarian items separately.

Basically, vegetarians get black beans and rice with a choice of fried or steamed yucca or plantains. I chose the fried yucca just to try something new and discovered that, unfortunately, I don't like the smell of it. That's just me, though - my husband couldn't smell anything. But between the beans, rice, complimentary bread (not really appealing to my taste but interesting), salad, and milkshake, I didn't even have room for the yucca. 

In fact, I would come back just for the enormous Ensalada de Havana. (I ordered mine without chicken, which I feel should be discounted, but I admit that few restaurants seem to have that policy.) Apple, grated manchego, cashews, citrus segments, honey vinaigrette - yumsie! Presentation was as beautiful as the salad was delicious.

I'd also come back for the Cuban-style milkshake. (Cuban-style = milk, condensed milk, ice, sugar - thinner than a typical milkshake but just as rich.) I ordered boring old chocolate because I really wanted a choc fix, but the shake was so creamy and satisfying that I'm afraid it's what I'd get again and again, as much as I'd like to try flavors such as triga, mamey, and coconut.

Service was perfect and refills were plentiful. Everyone was friendly. The interior is pleasant and, even though my ample tush usually prefers booth seating, the chairs were comfortable. Misters made patio dining on a 100+ day look pleasant.

I don't know how HG compares to other Cuban restaurants in the valley (including their sister restaurant near downtown). Possibly the blandness of the beans was \"the Henderson factor\" talking. (I love Henderson, but...) Or maybe that's just HG's style. Regardless, dining here was completely pleasant and even as a vegetarian with limited options, I'd be happy to come back any time."}
{"text":"The food was amazing.  No complaints. It was a little expensive but food and service amazing. My mojito was delicious. Was skeptical because I had never had cuban food before. BOY WAS I MISSING OUT!"}
{"text":"Havana grill is the place we always go in Vegas. The husband is cuban and definitely let's his eyes and heart do the ordering. We always end up with a table of food and he says it's like his grandma used to make! I suggest the croquettes, tamales, riquimbin. But is authentic and great."}
{"text":"This is the second time I've been to this place. The food was good the first time  but the service was horrible. It was a young male waiter and he was clueless on how to fill water or check on us. However, I did like the food and figured maybe hat was not the norm, so I brought my family a second time and the service level was the exact same. I'm not certain who our waiter was because a lady helped us and she couldn't be found other than the few times she checked on us. The same young male waiter was here again and he delivered like before, which I'm not even sure if he looked at us as he was kinda helping us. The food was good but wouldn't recommend coming here if you want even a reasonable service level. I will say that the bus boy or helper was pretty awesome. If it wasn't for him, we probably would have walked out. Sorry I try not to be this harsh, but it was bad."}
{"text":"It was Friday and I heard this was the spot to be at if you wanted a hell of a good time, a HOT place to be with latin dancing, great drinks and food, cool enviroment.  Too bad it was only lunch time, there wasn't any dancing going on.  I've been here a few times and their food is always good and I love the enviroment though I still have not been here at night when all the partying is happening, one day I will. They have Latin Nights on Friday and Sat with salsa dancing and a DJ. It suppose to be a 18+ event with no cover.

In the past I've had some of their sandwiches. The Sandwich Cubano as off of the menu \"The traditional Cuban sandwich with tender roasted sliced pork, sliced ham, cheese, dill pickles and mustard on pressed Cuban bread\" and with plantain chips. Tell me you don't want that just from reading it, at least I did.  Ate it and enjoyed it too. I've also had some beef sandwich but I'm not sure which one it was.  It was very good.

For this last time I wanted to try something different and asked the server for a recommendation that's not a sandwich. I almost always take what is recommended so lunch was the Lechon Asado a \"slowly oven-roasted leg of pork, marinated in a mojo of lemon, garlic, lime, orange juice and spices\" with moros which I was told it's was usually made on holiday's or something.  I liked the way the entire dish was explained to me when I ordered it as I was sold.  The dish as a whole was pretty good I did like the moros and the fluffy bread.  The pork leg was good just a liitle too citrusy for me but still good since I cleared my entire plate. I didn't get any plantain chips this time, which was a bummer.

There are a lot of ceiling fans, the a/c was flowing, latin music was playing, people were dining and drinking.  I really wanted to stay but I was only on my lunch break booo. They also have a lot of space to party at the bar, an outdoor patio, and lots of tables for when the party starts. There's also the movie theather next door and Mediterranean restaurant with belly dancing across the complex.  This is the complex to be at. LOL"}
{"text":"This was my first experience with Cuban food and my goodness, it was tasty!

We sat down on a Friday night before seeing a movie and it was an excellent decision. Not too crowded and I immediately loved the atmosphere and lighting. Our waiter was extremely helpful and pleasant. After telling him that I had no idea what to order and that it was my first time, he made a bunch of awesome recommendations and explained some of the dishes. 

We ordered an off the menu special appetizer - meatballs covered in some type of spicy-but-sweet barbecue sauce. There were four and they were a bit small, so I thought they were overpriced....but STILL DELICIOUS!

I told our waiter that I wanted steak and he recommended the Bistec De Palomilla, which was basically marinated steak, thinly sliced, with onions all over it. I chose to have their special beans and rice mix (cooked with bits of pork). My girlfriend ordered the Ropa Vieja. Our food came out very quickly and I couldn't get over how something so simple could be so delicious! There was nothing at all fancy about the steak, but the flavors were unbelievable. I really enjoyed my dish! 

We also ordered a side of plantains, which was great. I as apprehensive because I don't understand the concept of cooked bananas, but they were a very complimentary taste to the steak and rice/beans. 

The wait staff was friendly and I never had to ask for a drink refills. 

I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Was in town for a little R&R and knew that I intended to stop here. Been wanting some Cuban food and the spot here had closed. It was easy to find the location and the servers were very friendly. I knew what I wanted (Pollo de la Plancha) and my food was excellent. The red beans were amazing and had great flavor.

Loved the size of the location and how spacious it was. When I come back to Vegas, will definitely be returning to this location to try some other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Great food! Awesome banana shakes! Cuban Sandwiches are great! The pan con bistec was absolutely delicious! Great atmosphere, fun and elegant! Staff was very friendly. I will definitely eat there again."}
{"text":"A Cuban food newbie, the other night was my first experience at Havana Grill. 

My friends and I have established a weekly tradition of dining out at different venues every Friday night, some groups larger than others depending on who can or is interested in attending. 

Havana Grill was the spot this past week.

We made reservations for a party of (12) and were accommodated without trouble(the joint was dead to be completely honest). Seated promptly at 8pm, our dinner menus were not brought to our table until a bit after 8:30pm.  Several staff members tended our table and it was clear there was a communication break down somewhere along the line. Server #1 would approach the table to take a drink order and moments later we were asked for our drink orders by another member of the staff. 

Several friends ordered appetizers; the food sporadically arrived in no particular order, some being served around 9pm, others finally hitting the table at 9:10pm.  Entrees.. they too arrived whenever the wait staff remembered to bring them out.  I would say that in addition to that lack of communication between staff members, our annoyance changed focus to the timing in which all food dishes were served.

My friends possess the tradition of waiting until each meal is served before diggin in to their own meals, so waiting 5, 10, and even 15 minutes in between meals being brought out made for an annoyed group of people and cold meals.

Enough about the service and bad timing of the food being presented.. Lets talk about the food itself. It's OK.  I can say that no one at our table was blown away by flavor during this dining experience. 

All in all I would say this was yet another mediocre dining experience where each of us left with a small dent in our wallets, a couple of trips made to the bathroom later, and no real desire to return in the future.

I would CONSIDER eating here again if we had a smaller group of people, perhaps large parties are just too confusing for some service industry \"professionals\"?"}
{"text":"Until the US government wakes up and opens up access to Cuba, this place will do nicely!  Fantastic mojito's!  Seriously dangerous!   You have been warned.

Great Cuban authentic dishes cooked with a flair and passion.  Live music on the weekends.  This place is a treasure!!!  Stop in for lunch for some great sandwiches and plantain chips!  One of my favorite spots."}
{"text":"I teach at CSN & my Cuban students recommended this place. My husband & I saw a need to celebrate our love & life on this TGIF evening. Wow. Great ambience, good food, & excellent service by Alejandra & Luis. There's live music & a dancing floor, & they're open till 2AM on Fri & Sat. We'll be back soon for sure, with family & friends."}
{"text":"We called 1 hour  before showing up to this place; we get here and we're told it was closed.  The woman on the phone said they had music, food and dancing.  But NOOOOO.  We show up and the place is EMPTY.  We walked in and immediately told that they are closed because no one has showed up.  

There was no music, no food, nobody.  What a disappointment."}
{"text":"Good food, good entertainment, and GREAT service. Ask for Carlos and his twists on the mojitos and mai tai :)"}
{"text":"I love this place. Haven't been in awhile and I don't know why! Food is fantastic and service is great! Btw the salmon is delicious"}
{"text":"Love this place, best cafe con leche ever, we visit every time we come to Las Vegas. Food is great, service the best, Belinda is very nice and does a great job! Highly recommended. The palomilla stake is great, red beans, sweet fry bananas, ropa vieja all very good. Thank you for brining a piece of Cuba to us."}
{"text":"Really nice hole in the wall kind of feel! I love their red beans and rice so good!! It's right next to the movies which is a prefect location for them! They have the best Cuban food I've had in a very long time !"}
{"text":"This is more of a club than restaurant. But the food is good. 
Hard to believe this place is there because it's way too cool for where it is. (Not in Miami and far from the strip haha)
Best looking women I've seen in Vegas are there lol
If you like salsa dancing this is the place to go 
If you want to go to Miami but don't have 300$ for a plane ticket, go here
Good food good service good music and dancing beautiful women... Hidden gem."}
{"text":"I have parents from Cuba, and grew up eating Cuban food! I LOVED this place. It has been hard for me to find good Cuban restaurants outside of Miami and my grandmothers kitchen, but this place gets it right. Plus I heard they have fun salsa nights on Saturdays! I will have to go back to check that out. Definitely worth a visit!"}
{"text":"We really like this place.  Very good food.  Good Drinks . . . . Get the $5 sangria and you won't be sorry.  AND they catered to our one year old.  All in all, this is a place we plan on frequenting often."}
{"text":"My favorite place for real Latin dancing!! Great environment, lots of fun, zero pressure and great drinks."}
{"text":"We came in hungry after a movie Friday night because it is conveniently located right next to the Colonnade theater. We had never had cuban food, but love the movie Chef, and figured it smelled good, so why not try it, and it was right there. We had our two young children and it was about 7:40 pm.  After waiting to be seated for 5 minutes, to an empty restaurant, they finally led us to a table. The kids menu was a little off putting because it had adorable pictures of a piggy, a cow, a chicken, and a steer next to the kids choices. I was like...um, maybe you don't want to have an adorable picture of a piggy right next to the pork  \"piggy junior\", since some kids in the U.S. don't realize they're actually eating piggies! I didn't even want to show them the menus and just tried to read off the choices. I could see my older daughter's face go sad when she saw the illustrations of the piggy, cute cow, and chicken on the menu. Luckily she didn't start asking questions, because she already knew, but hates to be reminded she's eating animals that are lovable. We ordered, then the waiting began...We waited, and waited, and waited, and waited for our food to arrive. Both my kids 45 minutes later had eaten all the bread and drank down two milks, and by now were begging to go home, but we had waited that long and just wanted to eat already!!!! Not to mention the loud music that wasn't even Cuban music which would've been nice to add the cultural flair, but it was just noisy, annoying music. There was a band that was trying to get set up, but they never got to signing when we were there.  The servers were nice, but clueless that we were starting to get frustrated with the wait. Finally one came up and asked if everything was alright and I said we've been here for like..EVER. They finally tried to rush maybe one chef I'm guessing they had in the back and finally brought the food, but not all at once...it was one plate at a time for each person staggered, instead of everyone's dinner served all at once. I HATE that, but of course, right? Not at all surprising they didn't have all of our orders ready all at once. So my daughter ate first and was nearly finished before everyone else. Then my husband's fajitas came 5 minutes later. Then finally mine. Ugh!!!The ONLY, and I mean ONLY redeeming quality was that the food was really good. Then once we were eating the music and strobe lights began. Every 3 seconds the strobe lights hit us directly in the eyes. It was a nightmare, so with that we couldn't get our check fast enough. Even though the food was very good, we will never go back again. The off-putting illustrations on the kids menu, the extremely long waiting for over 45 minutes, the staggered service of the food, and the strobe lights right in the face is enough reason to never be back. There are too many other fantastic choices to go out to eat in both Vegas and Henderson. If you love their food, then I'd recommend doing take out here so you don't have to wait, and just come pick up when it's ready. But definitely don't come here with kids who are hungry."}
{"text":"The manager of this place doesn't give it a shit about customers.
Don't know her name but she was working yesterday Saturday Oct 21 around 6pm. On her early 50s with blue eyes. 

On the other hand I happen to know the owner personally. A very hardworking individual that love his businesses and the quality of his product. 
Unfortunately not all of his employees share his dedication."}
{"text":"Lovelovelove.  I'm not too adventurous when it comes to food but I really like their menu.  Lots of chicken dishes and all sound great.  I've tried a few things but none of which I can remember but I know I liked them all.

Good mojitos and dancing later in the evening too.

Definately an enjoyable place."}
{"text":"Happy Hour from 4-7pm Tuesday -  Sundays. All Drinks are half off, including the amazing mojito's! There is close to a dozen mojito flavors from original to mango and coconut! Yummy!

I ordered the original mojito and asked for less sugar, because mojito's are made with simple syrup. I guess that was my version of a \"skinny\" mojito. The bartender made it rather well. Now that it is starting to get warmer in Las Vegas, it was delightful and refreshing happy hour drink I enjoyed at the bar before my party arrived. They make their mojito's the correct way with lots of freshly muddled mint and freshly squeezed lime juice! The bar is sectioned off by a large glass panels. The patio and outdoor seating seemed pleasant, however, that is where they allow smokers to smoke. :/ If there is any kind of breeze, non-smokers will enjoy some second hand smoke on their behalf. 

I believe on the weekends, the restaurant turns into a latin dance party....

Whenever I eat here I always get the same thing. The \"Arroz Blanco, Frijoles negros Y Platanos Fritos\" which is white rice, cuban style black beans, and sweet plantains. I usually substitute the plantains for yucca mojo, which is their signature dish. Nothing short of amazing! Yucca is a root that is slowly steamed down to its perfect texture, almost melting in your mouth. The mojo sauce consists of olive oil, garlic, lemon/lime juice. Also topped with sauteed onions. Their cuban style black beans are also slowly cooked down, they don't use stock, it's just water, the beans and spices reduced down to the perfect texture. This dish is GLUTEN FREE! :)

The service is usually better than average. This time around our server spoke good English so the language barrier was not an issue, but most of them, English is a second language. The menu is in Spanish and English, so that too is helpful. 

Don't forget to finish your meal with a cuban coffee! Oh yums! Basically it's espresso with sugar, if you prefer. Just gives a nice jolt after eating all that yummy food!"}
{"text":"Awesome arroz con pollo y frijoles! nice mojitos, friendly staff, good ambience and live Salsa music. Increible!"}
{"text":"Wonderful authentic Cuban cuisine and it is in the most surprising location in (near) Las Vegas.  We found it through our Garmin and picked it as we are familiar with Cuban cuisine. We love Cuban food!  We missed the Cuban entertainment, as we were traveling through and just wanted an interesting meal.  But it was not crowded and we were seated right away, a big plus when you are driving through.

I had the \"Sandwich Cubano\", and it was no ordinary sandwich.  The flavors were great.  Wife had the \"Arroz Con Pollo\" and since she is a great fan of chicken she reported it to be great.  BIL and SIL were with us, and they had no complaints.  They are picky eaters and shy away from \"foreign\" food, but it was a successful dinner and did not cost us an arm and a leg.

I would recommend this place and I gave it four stars +, and rounded up to 5 because they are doing such a good job."}
{"text":"My goodness where do I start terrible Service I had to ask for water four times never got it have to get up go all the way to the back and asked the waitress  one more time if she could please give me 3 cups of water she comes back with the jug no cup how are we supposed to drink the water ! Our food  was brought out and the left it on the tray for 5 to 10 minutes well the waitress help someone  else table I was about to get up and just grab my food from the train really  I waited again to pay for my food the waitress never came I have to get up one more time walk  the bar the b ask her for my bill wow !!"}
{"text":"We ordered the Pollo a la Plancha with moras rice which Is pretty much black beans and rice, chicken was very good. The resturant was slow with only five other couples, the only down fall was waiting about 30 mins for the moras to be cooked which was worth it. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for something different and great food."}
{"text":"Not too many places in town that you can comfortably sit outside in the middle of our summers, but this place has an aggressive misting/fan system going on and we were so excited until the smokers came out and took over the patio. So we had to move inside, it was a Friday night and they were going to have salsa dancing later, so our server seated us in the dance floor area. We primarily came to watch salsa dancing and for some mojitos, but I am a self proclaimed high maintenance cocktail drinker, I don't do cheap wine or alcohol, so I was bummed when I saw they make their mojitos with Cruzan Rum, so our bartender suggested 10 Cane Rum which I never heard of but we agreed to a pitcher. My first sip all I could taste was soda water. Yuck, this isn't a mojito, this is soda water on the rocks. I didn't say anything to my friends at the table, 2 others said the same thing. So we decided to give the Sangria a try. We ordered a pitcher of red, when it came out, I immediately noticed the color, it was pink, like Kool-Aid, and that's exactly what it tasted like. If you mixed Ocean Spray Cran and Kool-Aid together, you would get their week attempt at Sangria. No drink left behind, that's what I've always learned, but these were the worst attempts at 2 of my favorite cocktails I've ever had. We ended up leaving both pitchers because none of us could drink them. 
I tried the mini Cuban sandwich, which was pretty good, as well as the plaintains, which is why this place is deserving of 2 stars. Our service was atrocious, so slow. I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Having a Cuba Libre at Havana Grill while I wait for pickup. Gotta love happy hour. Good drinks, good food, friendly faces. I love this place."}
{"text":"I don't know the real authentic Cuban food because I've never been to Cuba or I've never had a Cuban friend. But I think I know good Cuban food because I used to live in Ft. Lauderdale (near Miami) and have eaten at so many good Cuban restaurants. I still believe the best Cuban restaurant in the states is in Miami but this place come very close to what I use to eat in Ft. Lauderdale. (La Bamba Mexican - Cuban restaurant)
I always order Pollo a la plancha or Palomilla steak with black beans and rice. Their food always remind me of the time and memories when I was in Florida and makes me want to go back to Florida. 
The waitress Alejandra is always very pleasant and accommodating. She is from Cuba. She knows exactly how I want my food...like raw onions in black bean cup (Ft. Lauderdale style). 
I visited their sister restaurant, Florida café, too but the food taste the same to me. (The bakery is a different story, of course.) Just this place is in better neighborhood and closer to my house. 
I like to come here after I watch a movie in the theater right next. Good for lunch and dinner."}
{"text":"Had a friend visiting from Oklahoma, So on he's last night here we took him to havana grill, for the atmosphere and the food. 
the service was great, even with the loud music and the other distractions. its definitely not the place you want to go to on the weekend after 10pm, if you want to have conversations and stuff, cause we couldnt really hear each other talk with the music, which is expected i guess lol; cause it kinda turns into a little club in the middle of the dancefloor, but people can still sit around and hang out. Also we went on a friday night after 10pm, and there was a live dj.
the food, at least what i ordered was...idk..eehhh. I wasnt happy with it, but everyone elses food tasted really good, maybe its just what I ordered, the fried plantain was on point though! took me back home for a mn...loved it. but i will definitely go back, before 10pm on the weekend if i'm more interested in conversing and eating :)
i loved the music. i loved the cuban, salsa, reggaeton mix the dj was playing, wouldve had more fun if i was with a bunch of my dancing friends though  lol :)"}
{"text":"I absolutely adore Cuban food! I'm no expert by any stretch of the imagination, but I know what I like. And what I like is some vaca frita. The version at Havana Grill ($12 during lunch) is excellent -- finely shredded beef slow roasted with garlic, salt, lemon, lime and plenty of spices then seared. mmmm... It's so mouth-wateringly good. The best part are the few pieces of beef that were seared too long, making them extra crispy. It's served with rice and black beans.

Because of some of the similarities between Cuban food and the food my mom used to cook, this -- to me -- is comfort food. It's the kind of food that reminds me of home and instantly puts a smile on my face. After taking a few bites of the vaca frita I wanted to pound the table and tell anyone around me how good it was. But, I was eating an early lunch and there was no one else in the dining room.

After cleaning off the plate, I finished the meal with some flan ($4). It's a fairly large portion, needlessly served with whip cream and a cherry on the side with some chocolate sauce drizzled around the plate. All that stuff is unnecessary because it doesn't add anything to the flavor. The flan itself was decent, but c'mon... it's not better than my mom's. Its consistency was way too firm.

The next time I need a pick-me-up I'll be back. There's plenty of dishes on the menu I need to try.

4.5 Stars"}
{"text":"STAY AWAY.  It takes HOURS to get served and receive drinks, apps, food, check!!! Bummer....we wanted to like this place!!  We miss our Miami and Tampa Cuban food!  Service is AWFUL due to one server for about 20 tables this Saturday afternoon. Perhaps it's better in the evening with more help??!  We could have flown to Havana, ate, and returned based on the time it took to order, get drinks, get food......yikes."}
{"text":"Myself, my wife & another couple ate here on a Wednesday evening & the only meal that was fresh was the salad ordered by one of our group. The seafood in the paella was overcooked & the rice was mush. An order of Cuban porkchops were inedible and the salmon dish ordered was not cooked as requested. The ceviche appetizer was just chopped shrimp. Boo! Even the sangria was lacking. I don't think the owners can decide whether this is a restaurant or a nightclub."}
{"text":"Let me get right to it: we started with the papas rellenas, which weren't all that special, but definitely edible. I had the ropa vieja de pollo which was excellent! I ordered it with moros and an extra side of maduros. The moros - I've definitely had better, next time I would just order rice and beans separately - this made me sad, because moros are delicious if done correctly. The maduros were cooked well! We also had the pan con bistec which was flavorful, but the bread to steak and stuffing ratio was a bit off - too much bread, not enough stuffing. I would come back to try more - especially their happy hour which looks fantastic. I would give this place 3.5 stars, but yelp doesn't allow for that, so I boosted them up a half star because their service was on par ;)"}

{"text":"Let me start off by saying the music and DJ was great! However, service was terrible and food was mediocre at best. This was my second time trying Cuban food and this time was such a disappointment. We had so many different servers I can't even remember; one who handed us our menus, another who brought us our drinks 15 minutes after being seated, a person whom we placed our order with, someone who brought us the food, and whoever else we could flag down to help us. All these people, yet no one was available or provided good service? There was even a point in time where we waited an hour for a drink from the bar only for the bartender to nonchalantly bring it to us like we did not ask her or the other servers three times prior that. Then when it came time to close the check, the lady mistakenly forgot to add an item to our check saying, \"Oops, I messed up.\" Are you kidding me? Now here we are waiting once again when we were trying to get the hell out of there and never come back. You want some decent Cuban food and good service? Go to Cuba Cafe instead."}
{"text":"Just about the only thing I enjoyed about this place was the drinks. I had a sip of just about everyone's drink, and they were all pretty tasty.

I dined with Emily E. (below, in the party of 12), and I agree with everything she said.

While the food wasn't bad, it was not worth the price -- $65 for my husband and me. I have no problem paying for quality, but Havana Grill simply wasn't worth it.

The waiter was downright rude at times. I felt he didn't put much effort into service because he knew he was getting 18 percent gratuity (not what I would have left by any means had I the choice).

I am sad there aren't many Cuban restaurants in town, as I long for the authentic fare I ate in Miami two years ago. Looks like we locals just won't get the chance to experience something better."}

Alejandra (the waitress) doesn't know how to do basic math. She sucks. We wanted to do separate checks and she couldn't do that. It took her about 15 minutes to run our cards and that's with my help. She wanted to charge $13 for 2 waters, are you kidding me?!!!! Food was ok, nothing special. Music was good, DJ was nice. Bad service, yet we were force to tip. We decided to never come back and we are going to make sure none of friends  one either!"}

{"text":"I love going to Havana Grill. I'm Cuban and while, I'm pretty picky on my homeland food, I was very disappointed. I came in with my husband to get a good nosh and what I found was utter failure. As I was scouring the menu I found A LOT of Mexican food offerings. Chalupas, burritos, chip and salsa. When did Cubans start eating tortillas? No disrespect to Mexicans, but the restaurant is Cuban. We ordered the appetizer with the mini Cuban sandwich, croquetas, papa rellena and tamale. It was luke warm and not as hearty as it used to be. Cu-Mex fusion...not for us. Stick with Cuban..."}
{"text":"After reading some of the other reviews, I see that my mistake when visiting the Havana Grill was that I did not drink that evening. You need to drink the mojitos if you come here. Drink several before you order. Then perhaps you will not notice that the plantains are hard and cold, and that the service staff, though very courteous and amiable, are poorly trained and don't really get the basics of how to provide restaurant service. Maybe it was just the night I was there.

The atmosphere is lovely, though. Except for when the busboy was vacuuming the entrance way."}
{"text":"Service has gone down hill, have been coming here for over a decade. No more..
Over an hour wait for appetizer. This is the last time I visit Havana Grill. 

They need a complete make over the owners should fire everyone."}
{"text":"We had the worst experience here. Our waitress was incompetent and had a major attitude. My daughter ordered a chicken quesadilla that came with sour cream and guacamole and it didn't come with either! I asked the waitress about the guacamole and she went in circles about how they didn't have any guacamole...so I asked the waitress why I'm paying for a quesadilla with only cheese and chicken for $12!! The manager told the waitress to give me a $3 discount on our meal! 3 DOLLARS?!? Bad service bad management. Never coming back here again."}
{"text":"It's such a treat coming here! The ambiance is warm and comforting. The food is homemade and absolutely delicious. Everything is fresh and perfectly Cuban! It's like going home to Mom!"}
{"text":"Typically, I love coming here. The sangria is amazing and the ropa vieja is to die for... However; it was 9:24 and the flashing \"open\" sign said they closed at 10 o'clock... So I walk in with people who also love the food and they tell me they are closed. It was over a half hour before closing time and they won't serve us. 
I do love the food, but without good service, there's no way I can give it a good review. All I wanted that night was a good dinner and good drinks so they kind of ruined my day... And I'm just visiting. 
As I said before... The food is amazing and I would have given it all 5 stars if it wasn't for tonight but I can't let a restaurant keep a 5 star status when they do something like that. I would never do something like that."}
{"text":"Great place for Happy Hour, love their Mojitos!!!"}
{"text":"Mediocre. Not enough flavor. Oh good luck trying to have a conversation..................."}
{"text":"I love this place. Their food is delicious. FRICASE DE POLLO CON PAPAS A LA HAVANERA is my favorite dish. I also like their cuban sandwich. Their rice is also very good. I like their banana chips too. On the weekends before, they had live band performing and salsa dancing at night time. The service is friendly and atmosphere is nice too. It's now 30% off at lunch time."}
{"text":"I have two things to say. GREAT FOOD, sloowww service."}
{"text":"Just wanted to compliment the waitress (Julietta) for being very helpful and friendly. You can tell when a waitress is being fake friendly and she was not. Great service thru out the meal."}
{"text":"I read the reviews (focusing on the ones with okay or bad experiences) and wasn't excited to try this place. I had a negative opinion going in. I was WRONG again. This place was really good. Better than my top Cuban place in Las Vegas. I will be back for sure. The inside is nice and large and spacious. The service was good and on time and the food was even better. Authentic Cuban.

PROS:  
*Yuca con Mojo y Chicharrones - Sauteed tender yuca smothered in onions and garlic sauce with fried pork skins on the side. Eat them together and it's a party in your mouth. 

*Lechon Asado Al Despelote - slowly roasted leg of pork marinated in a mojo of limon, garlic, lime, orange juice and spices, served over fried smashed yuca. The fried smashed yuca is a meal in itself. Wonderful when eaten together. LARGE portion. 

*Fricase de Pollo Con Papas a la Havanera - Chicken simmered with tomatoes, potatoes, red wine, olives and spices. 

*They were on Groupon. 

CONS:
*Far from my home distance wise.

*Food arrived almost all at once (appetizers and dinner). Didn't matter that much though."}
{"text":"Terrible Terrible Terrible.  What once was my favorite is now my worst. Ordered take out about $75 worth of food and they messed up almost all of it.  Our platanos were burnt and not sweet at all, our breads cold and hard.  Both bowls of soup looked & tasted days old, horrible.  My entree was shredded pork over yucca with Mojo sauce.  No mojo sauce was given and ruined the dish. Also it usually has bell peppers on top but I guess they forgot.  I called to make a complaint and all they could say was \"oh we forgot\".  Save your time and money, try Florida Cafe. Much better food quality and service."}
{"text":"Nice cute place with good service and good prices.  I found the food to be a little bland, not seasoned as much as I prefer cuban food to be seasoned. Mojitos were good. The music is really good and easy parking"}
{"text":"Delicious Cuban restaurant not far from the Las Vegas strip - nice atmosphere, friendly staff, & extensive menu choices!"}
{"text":"Food ok... Service was terrible.. Just slow,
Or Should I say not caring.. Asked for a drink that took an hr.. ordered food that took 2hrs, asked for desert that took another 2hrs.. Not to mention we had to chase down out server just to order.. Wanted to Complain about the hair in my food but judging by the service that would have gotten me no where. WILL NEVER EAT HERE AGAIN!"}
{"text":"We got ropa vieja and arroz con pollo.   They were pretty good.  We liked ropa vieja better.   The chicken in arroz con pollo was fair.  It came on the bone which I didn't care for nor expect.   also don't get chips and salsa.  Salsa was horrible.    And it was two tiny cups for 5 bucks."}
{"text":"I love their Vaca frita.The plantain is really good.  The service could get a little polishing. I go there when I have a craving for beef. Music is up beat. It is convenient because it is near the theaters and my favorite Korean Restaurant"}
{"text":"Food is great ropa vieja to die for. Latin might are great Friday and Saturday. This my place to go when In Vegas have celebrated several  birthdays here the staff is awesome.Don't try their Cuban sandwich it's a let down"}
{"text":"I love love love this place.  We just came here for drinks, and I'm so glad we did! The Mojitos were perfect and the bartender was giving us samples of different flavors of Mojitos and offering suggestions from the menu.  I ended up ordering a salad which was pretty tasty...I can't wait to come back and try other things on the menu.  The atmosphere and music were perfect, and there was a hot guy smoking a cigar and drinking a Corona...it just looked right!"}
{"text":"We came here from california we loved it we got arroz con pollo , pork in garlic sauce plantains etc! All was good!"}
{"text":"Great service, and the atmosphere is wonderful. The food is delicious!!! Plus they have awesome mojitos. Stumbled across this place during a charity family day in the shopping center. The first place I noticed with the wonderful music and people that they have out supporting the cause."}
{"text":"I went here for a friend's birthday and we had a blast! I made reservations for 10 people and the staff was very accommodating with a large group.Happy hour was until 7 pm so we enjoyed some refreshing pre-dinner mojitos for about $4 each.

Most of our group were Cuban food rookies and our waiter was gracious enough to provide recommendations and explain the menu. He suggested we get an appetizer sampler which came with a tamal, mini Cuban sandwich, croquettas and lots of other goodies. This was my favorite part of the meal.

I ordered lechon asado which was so tender and flavorful. Several in my group ordered Ropa Vieja which literally translates to old clothes. It is a traditional Cuban dish that has shredded beef in a tomato sauce. It tastes like Filipino menudo to me with a twist. We had some fried plantains and yuca on the side.
All of us were full and satisfied and had more than enough for leftovers.

I had the Orgasmo Habanero for dessert simply because of the name! It has three layers - chocolate, tres leches and flan. It definitely lived up to it's name!

Havana Grill is a fun restaurant with friendly and attentive staff. I don't know much about Cuban food but everything I tried was delicious. Next time we'll go when they have live music and get our hookah on!"}
{"text":"My friend had eaten at this restaurant before and ordered a roasted pork entree and he didn't like it.  However, he wanted to give it another try yesterday so we decided to go.  I was in a pissy mood, so I already doubted that this place would be any good, however, I was taught to try something at least three times before I 'X' it out of my life.  

After glancing through the menu, nothing seem appetizing to me.  Then, I remembered that Cubans are known for their cuban sandwiches, and found it under the appetizer section ($7).  Then glance down the menu some more, and saw the pork and corn meal tamal ($5).  Glance down a little more, there is a whole appetizer plate with both of these items on there, plus chicharrones and croquetas (all for $15).  Of course then I ordered the appetizer plate, and that put a smile on my face because it was YUMMY.  There is this dipping sauce that came with the plate, made everything exponentially YUMMY.  Oh, almost forgot, there were fried plantains as well.  

My friend ordered the shrimp ajillo, that was alright, maybe because there was so much more flavor in the appetizer plate.  Because it was so yummy, I ordered the red sangria ($5), and boy was I glad to order it.  Also, they give you a basket of fresh warm bread with a moist center, and just enough butter to make it delicious.  

I would definitely come back to this restaurant for some more of those appetizer and sangria!"}
{"text":"Great ambiance. Happy hour menu awesome! 4-7pm. Fridays are sangrias for $4 and they are delicious. Staff friendly and attentive. For sure we'll be back soon."}
{"text":"The menu is extensive and is dressed in the traditional culinary garb of Cuba --they have ropa vieja, paella, tender sirloin steak, the famous Cuban sandwich, shrimp enchilada, slow-roasted juicy pork, the traditional fried cow, shrimp, and rice and chicken. All meals are accompanied by white rice and black beans, or colorados. It's a fun and a relaxed atmosphere. 

In addition the place is pretty clean, and offers live entertainment on the weekends. I couldn't stay for the live music but wished I did. Service was good. The prices are a bit high for Cuban food which is very inexpensive but that is probably due to the fact that this is the nicest Cuban restaurant in the Las Vegas area."}
{"text":"We've eaten here a few times and enjoyed the food.  In the past, we were the only people in the place.  So service wasn't an issue.

This weekend was a nightmare.  We told our waitress that we just wanted some light appetizers and some drinks as we were catching a movie next door.  She seemed upset or frustrated that we were not ordering a full dinner.  We each got our drinks pretty quick - but after an hour, our two appetizers still hadn't arrived.  While sitting for that long I did find the Groupon deal and bought it while I was sitting there.

Now we were up against the clock and we couldn't wait any longer.  I told my family to go check into the movie and I would let them know we're going to leave.  After 15 minutes, I still couldn't find my waitress. (The place isn't that big and there must have been a half a dozen food servers in a small and moderately busy restaurant ). FINALLY  she came out - with my food packaged to go. When I told her this was ridiculous - she snapped back at me and said they were busy in the kitchen.  Now I have $50 check and I get to go put it in my car for a few hours.  

I asked to see the manager and suddenly her English was not all that great.  I tried to show her my Groupon deal and she just walked away with my credit card and the check - with an attitude.

If I wasn't late and my family already sitting in the theater I would have complained further.  So I was late for my show, the food simply went in a trash can and dinner consisted of one drink and some bread drenched in butter.  So now I am stuck with this groupon because I am not sure i really want to go back.  Maybe the manager will try to make it right.

I gave two stars simply because of mediocre visits in the past.  I really WANT TO like this place.  I just don't know if I can get past the service."}
{"text":"If you know what a CUBAN sandwich SHOULD taste like you need to go here for one, haven't had a better one in Vegas. Fried plantains on the side? Yes!!! My favorite sandwich dish, and the texture of the Cuban is not easy to master. I'm not fond of the location but customer service is decent, I say give it a go."}
{"text":"First time here. I love that there's love music and dancing. The Havana Cabana drink tastes like vacation. The shrimp and avocado salad was delicious and the ceviche was served with fried plantain chips which was a delicious surprise. I enjoyed the ambiance and all energy here. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Today was the first time dining in as opposed to take out, and the food was really tasty as usual. The service is ok, but nothing sensational. I asked for water and never received it, but the waiter was friendly enough. Just not overly accommodating. We didn't mind since it was a quick lunch, and we go for the food. My husband works nearby and has brought home food from here in the past that has always been absolutely delicious. We love the Lechon Asado al Despelote, pork dish. The rice and beans are really good that come with it. The Tostones are a nice side as well. The food is a really nice change from my usual healthy, zero fried, quite boring menu. Today I tried the Pollo a la Plancha chicken dish for the first time, and although it wasn't as good as the steak and pork dishes we usually get, it was still pretty good and had a nice lemony zest to it. I did however pick off of my husband's pork dish. I originally ordered the Churrasco con Salsa Chimichurri steak, but they were out of Chimichurri, so I opted for the chicken.  Other tasty items we've tried are Chorizo Frito (a little greasy for me but tasty never the less), and the Platanos Maduros - again not the healthiest choice, but so darn good. We'd go more often, but we live on the other side of town. At night, they open up one area for music and dancing. The bar looks nice as well. I've had Cuban food in South Florida that is probably more authentic, but this place is definitely a nice change from the usual restaurants we frequent in Summerlin. We'll continue to order out since it's on my husband's way home from work."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this restaurant. I only had soup and salad but it was great and the presentation was  something that you would expect in a fine dining restaurant. The music and ambiance made my lunch break a very enjoyable and relaxing experience"}
{"text":"My Husband and I had the wonderful opportunity to dine here. Havana Grill was fantastic! We can't wait to go back. Everyone was very friendly.  The atmosphere was perfect for date night or for a family night out. The Bread was fantastically fresh and perfectly buttered.  We had the Massas De Puerco Fritas (appetizer), OMG it was sooo good! Our meals were so flavorful. 
Each plate looked as though someone took the time to make it look nice. Not just thrown on the plate. 
We can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I ordered: Palomilla Empanlzada \"Milanesa\" ($16), Nachos Machos w/ beef ($13), Tres Leches ($7)

Pros:
* Milanese was delicious! It was like country fried steak, but w/ beef
* Meal sizes were generous 
* Servers were friendly & nice 
* They give free bread
* There's live music & dancing on Saturday nights (starting from 9pm, I believe)

Cons:
* Tres leches was OK. The cake was dry, like it wasn't soaked long enough in the milk
* Nachos were just OK. Although there were lots of meat & beans, I felt gypped on the sour cream & guacamole. However, it's a huge serving, so that's a pro.

I'd come back here! I really really liked the Milanese =)"}
{"text":"Ever since coming back from Miami and experiencing their cortadito coffees, my friends and I have been on the endless search for this espresso drink. 
I've always known about Havana Grill as my hairdresser and fave eatery, Jun's, is in the same complex; I guess I just never had the chance to eat here.

One morning I convinced my roomie to come with; and boy did we have more than just cortaditos! lol

We were the 1st ones there and I had read reviews about coconut water in their mojitos so, I had one (or two). It was very refreshing. I think too much ice as I was done with my 1st one very quickly...I guess I was thirsty ;)

Ordered shrimp ceviche, 2 orders of plantains (obvi), and vaca frita for me; and lechon asado for him. 

The waiter's recommendation of shrimp ceviche was so good as there was lots of shrimp and avocado, not just lots of onions. After we finished the ceviche, we just kept dipping the chips in the lemony sauce.

Plantains are always good. Sweet and crunchy on the side. YUM. I could just eat that and rice, like a Filipino breakfast.

Vaca frita is something I ordered based on the tips on Yelp but, I had no real clue on what it was. And deng, was it delicious. Shredded beef and onions and garlic was sooooooooooooooooooo tasty; and went sooooooooooooooooooo well with the rice. UGH. So reminiscent of Filipino breakfast with the garlic and salt on the rice.

Roomie loved his lechon asado. He said it was better than what he imagined it would be.  

We were about to leave when the waiter asked if we wanted coffee.....can you believe that we almost left without the very thing that got us there (cortadito)!!!?!!!! lol"}
{"text":"I've been looking for a good Cuban restaurant for years and when I started dating my boyfriend, he took me here. The food is so good."}
{"text":"Went there during the day right when they open so we had no worry about wait time. Staff was pleasant but not really in full gear since it barely opened, so getting drinks and bread took a little longer than I would have liked having been the only people there. That is the only objection I had to my wonderful experience there. My girlfriend had the carnitas while I had the Lechon sandwich. Having had Cuban sandwiches before this one did raise the bar to one of the best I've had ever before. Wish we went during the live music and later in the evening so we could have tried the mojitos. We will be back soon!!"}
{"text":"The vegetarian plate is surprisingly delicious for how simple it is. The mojitos are exceptional as well."}
{"text":"What is better than the real deal, authentic Cuban food?  Perfect in every way. My husband loved the tamales, Cuban style seasoned steak, rice & black beans& plantain bananas  \"Maduros\". We shared croquetas de jamon as appetizers. I had lechon asado, mariquitas and yuca with mojo, avocado salad. It was all delicious. Great service. The hostess was sweet and immediately welcomed us and took care of us, our table was cozy and very romantic spot. Our captain and waiter were there to explain the specials, and with basket of bread in hands. Didn't have to ask for anything. The staff anticipated our desires. Very well trained staff. Loved everything. Thank you very very much for another unforgettable evening!!!!"}
{"text":"Very authentic and a nice selection.  I had the Cuban sandwich of course with was fantastic.   My wife had the ropa vieja that she loved"}
{"text":"I'm on the fence about this one, We had dinner here on 2/8/15 and this trip was really a foodie trip, so we decided to try something different, so we asked a friend who travels to Vegas for work A LOT and he recommended this place and the mojito in particular.

The decor is dated but kind of cool, the music was nice, it looks like they have live bands there (but not on a Sunday night) 

We got a starter sampler (I don't remember what it was called, but there is only oone on the menu) and it was pretty good, the tamale was amazing and so was the mini cubano. 

He had a shredded beef dish (I tried it, it was really good, better than mine actually)

I asked our waiter if he recommended the the chicken or the pork dish I was torn between, he actually said he never ate either one. Soooooo I don't know how well they know thier menu's I'd think you should be able to make recommendations and at least give a better overview if someone who's never eaten there wants to try something new. 

I went with the pork, it was pretty good. 

We also ordered mojitos, tastey but I am not a fan of more stems than leaves, I asked why there were stems and was told they had more flavor - but for me, it made it really unattractive.

Would I return...? Sure, but I would probably order what my guy had and drink something with less stems, it was clean and the wait staff was friendly."}
{"text":"Maybe I am just not that into Cuban food.  The food was fine but everything had a little bit of sweetness to it that turned me off.  The atmosphere is nice and so is the hospitality.  One thing that you should order is the mojitos."}
{"text":"Great Cuban sandwiches and Mojitos. The outdoor patio seating is fun, because you can make fun of all the weird little kids hanging around in front of the movie theaters with their pants hanging off, and their hoods on, even though its 118 degrees out...Not that I'm judging them. I have one of my own at home (kid, not a hoodie).  :)  I have been there several times and usually get the mini Cuban sandwich, and Plaintain chips. They have a name, but I cant remember it unless I am looking at the menu. The menu is quite extensive, but if your drinking the mojitos, and I recommend it, you wont need much to eat.  And the more you have, the weirder those kids get...:)"}
{"text":"I've came here a couple of times (mainly by force) first off... the securities out front that I have dealt with have been rude and arrogant,  there is a 5-10 charge for women and the bartenders seem some what snooty as well. I once waited 20 min for a drink when they weren't even busy. Not a fan but they do play good music. so If your planning on JUST dancing then it's okay....."}
{"text":"I was craving Cuban food when I flew into Vegas. I found this place online and decided to try it after reading reviews. It was Monday around 8:30 pm and they were closed despite lisiting online they were open until 10 pm. I drove across town for nothing and leave town tomorrow.  They should really update their listings online."}
{"text":"A good cuban sandwich and cevichi coming right up! I've eaten here at least 20 times. I usually get lunch. I've come here for dinner a few times too. It's a different vive at night on the weekends. It can get busy. They play music, there's dancing sometimes and it's festive. I like their chickpea soup side dish. Yummy. The service has always been pretty good."}
{"text":"Wonderful food, fast service and a great menu at this active and busy restaurant. I've been here several times and like coming back.

I had the salad with avocado, cherry tomatoes and shrimp and my guest had the chicken ropa something. It was delicious. I would have given this place 5 stars but the garlic salad dressing tasted a little not homemade, and could have been even better."}
{"text":"Delicious food and mojitos! My server Belinda was very attentive and gave great recommendations"}
{"text":"Everything was great.  Cuban bread was authentic.  Roja Vieja and Picadillo were just like we remembered from when we lived in South Florida.  Service was excellent."}
{"text":"I had been itching to try this place out for so long because I worked with a fellow who was from Miami and raved about Cuban food (which was back in December). And word of mouth is Havana Grill is the place to get your Cuban food fix. Although I was a skeptical to try this place because of Teri C.'s review and the other reviews as well, I had to try them out for myself. 

Fortunately we came in during happy hour, which was half prized appetizers. We ordered the Mezcla de Aperitivos (consisted of tamal, papa rellenas, croquetas, and cuban sandwich) and Mini Sandwich Cubano. 

Tamal- I didn't like their tamal at all. More dry than usual and no taste either. 

croquetas- we weren't sure what these were because there wasn't a description on the bar menu. Unfortunately, as soon as I took a bite I spat it back out into my napkin. Maybe this was a little too authentic for me. 

Mini Cuban Sandwich- the bread was nicely buttered and the contrast between the mustard and pickles was a unique mix. The ham could had been a little tastier, but good enough. I was really expecting more based on how much people rave about Cuban sandwiches. I'm really hoping other Cuban places make a better one because theirs was just A-okay. 

There was no papa rellenas at the time was I was kind of sad because they serve those at Porto's Bakery. I also ordered the guava shake, although I'm not a big guava fan I was trying to be adventurous. I didn't really enjoy this drink because there was nothing special about it and I prefer my shakes on the thick side and itwas rather thin. 

Overall, the experience was okay. The service was a tad slow and the food didn't really impress me. The inside is nicely decorated and still gives off the mom and pop vibe. However, I don't think I will be coming here again."}
{"text":"Mojitos were good, prawn dish good, Ropa Vieja good. Pork dish (with the chunks of pork) was very dry. Description says marinated in 4 or 5 liquids but simmered and then fried, served without sauce = extremely dry. Served on very large plates the food is presented in its corners and it makes it feel like less of a value due to the presentation. I get the feeling other dishes might have been more appealing taste wise  (non fried,) but luckily I had a mojito in me and a large water to get it down. This was a return back to a place that I haven't been in years. I wouldn't have an issue going back, but I would ask many more questions before ordering. Wait staff was nice and service was fine."}
{"text":"Stepped in after seeing a movie next door. Excellent food, quick service and will definitely return."}
{"text":"I can tell they changed chefs yet again. It's a shame the food is not what it once was. They were definitely under staffed. Poor servers and buses were really trying but coming up short. They definitely need better management. It's a true shame to see this place fall."}
{"text":"The service was excellent.  The food was pretty good and the drink specials were outstanding.  I'd recommend the pork entrees; the appetizers were good bar food.  

The lunch specials during the week are a good price and plenty of food.



I'll definitely go back."}
{"text":"We both had steak and our dishes (one with onions and the other with chimichurri) were both very good. We can not complain about our dinners. The service was lacking, however. The hostess and the busboy both stood out as being very friendly and helpful. Our actual waitress however was quite unfriendly. She did not seem to know the menu, she did not seem to know the happy hour specials, and she never seemed very interested in us. She wouldn't even look at us when interacting with us. Additionally, they have a large number of staff who spend a large amount of time kissing each other and chatting and sadly this makes the service slow. At the end of it all, the quality of our dinners have kept this at 3 stars."}
{"text":"As i walked in the Havana Grill first thing i noticed is that it has a great atmosphere with the dim lighting and Latin music makes it a great place to just eat out as a family, or if you're taking somebody on a date because it's fancy but at the same time it is laid back.  Once we were seated the waiter was very helpful and friendly and soon i decided what I wanted. Who I was there with wanted an appetizer so we decided to get the Mezcla Aperitivo, which has a bunch of different appetizers in one which i thought was great because we got to try many of the different appetizers, it has a mini cuban sandwich, a tamale fried pork rinds, and plantains which were all very good and it came with a special mojo sauce on the side which made everything taste better. When they came and asked what we wanted I got a vanilla  milkshake and their salmon, the milkshake was definitely one of the best shakes I've had it was so creamy and good. The salmon had great flavor and seasoning and also the vegetables were great with the salmon, the rice mixed with black beans that comes with most dishes was an interesting combination of flavor and I wasn't expecting it but it was also; very good, definitely one of my favorite restaurants in my area and i go often"}
{"text":"This was our first adventure into a Cuban restaurant since we had a coupon for the place.  The food was decent but not great.  Our main complaint was that the portions were tiny for the price.  The stadd was very attentive."}
{"text":"Mojitos. I suggest Havana, pineapple, or mango mojito. If you are really not a mojito fan the sangria is to die for as well! If you can catch Carlos working he makes by far the best drinks! The food here is also great, ambience is perfect, love the patio seating!"}
{"text":"I love Havana grill!!! Although I always order the same things.... It's awesome. The fried plantines, and the cuban sandwhiches are my faves. The service is friendly everytime I go there, and the atmosphere is really nice. The only thing I wish was that the food was cheaper so I could go there more often!! =)"}
{"text":"Very, very disappointed  we ordered Pollo a la vaca, (chicken) it was very dry, tasteless, n small portion of the chicken, they didn't  serve the garlic dip, the black beans were tasteless also....I've been here many times in the past it's been over a year since my last visit,  n I was very disappointed, tres leches dessert, Not good. ..they apparently have changed their \"authentic recipe\" and for the price my friend that was visiting was not happy!!  Sad because we don't  have enough Latin food in Vegas...any suggestion?"}
{"text":"Giving this place a three star now that I've taste the white rice and beans. Plus my fried plantains was a little salty the second time."}
{"text":"OMG!! Cuban born and bred from Miami... I've been in Vegas about a year and a half now and I FINALLY FOUND A LEGIT SPOT!!! Palomilla.. are you kidding me?!?! I've been trying to find this all over the valley and these folks nailed it!! Arroz y frijoles con maduros round out the classic dish that I've been wanting to enjoy. Food, service, feel and everything else was absolutely well worth the trip. We will be back. Again and again!!"}
{"text":"D-E-L-I-S-H! I haven't been to a Cuban restaurant since 2007 and was pleasantly surprised when I visited Havana Grill with a friend of mine.  The food was delicious, the drinks were on point...I will definitely be visiting again!  Be sure to try the plantains! Yum!"}
{"text":"This place has really went down hill. Stopped in for Happy Hour and ordered a drink. Drank it. Then waiting. And waiting. And waited some more. 

Then I discovered that I have superpowers. I am invisible. Here I sit watching the staff wander around. But me? I sit here in a perpetual state of having an empty Tecate bottle and no food. Or service."}
{"text":"I drive about 30+ mins just to eat here for lunch in the weekends and well worth it. Dishes have always been on point every time"}
{"text":"I started off with a Saoco (silver rum, coconut juice, simple syrup, lime; $7.50). It just tasted like a non-minty mojito. All of my guy friends got different mojitos. We all took our first sip and cringed. \"Too sweet,\" was the consensus. I looked over at the bar and my suspicions were confirmed: girl bartender. But still, the drinks were good. Didn't stop us from ordering three more rounds. 

I also got a Cuban milkshake. My Cubano friend recommended the guayaba and guanabana mix ($5). He said the flavors separate are shit. But with their powers combined are mighty yummy. Might yummy indeed. I can't describe the flavor accurately. It was kind of cakey, but still tropical. Maybe a little banana-ish. 

We ordered the tostones. They're like little griled plantains with cheese and your choice of meat: shrimp, ground beef, or shredded beef. We got the Mezcla de Tostones ($11), a combo of all of the meats. They were okay. 

I ordered the Camerones al Aljillo ($19). A bit pricey for garlic shrimp. It was good, but with a recipe like shrimp, garlic, and butter, it had better be good. 

Cubano said the food was authentic and made him nostalgic for his madre's home cooking. I'll have to take his word for it. 

The service was a little slow. It was nice when we wanted to just sit around and shoot the shit, but not nice when we wanted to order another round or get the check. 

Havana Grill has live entertainment late on Fri and Sat nights and free salsa lessons Wed night.

{"text":"Tried this lovely spot for the 2nd time a few weeks ago , great night ! Food was amazing ! Great music, good crowd. We will definitelybe back !"}
{"text":"This place is great.  The food is spiced and cooked perfectly.  We had the appetizer sampler platter and everything on it was delicious.  I had the Masas de Puerco Fritas, my husband had the Vaca Fritas de Pollo -- both were superb - tender & juicy.  We couldn't stop eating it.  Black beans & rice were the best I've ever had.  Staff is friendly.  The restaurant's decor makes you feel like you're in Cuba.  We'll definitely go back."}
{"text":"Wow, that was awesome!  Great food, fast service, a little pricey but definitely worth it.  Definitely coming back.  It's a well kept secret.  I read prior reviews and was prepared for a small restaurant with slow service and found the exact opposite.  Definitely coming back.  Best Cuban food in town!"}
{"text":"The food was excellent. We had the lechon asado, yuca frita, sandwich cubano and masas de puerco. Service was very good."}
{"text":"I'm so sad that I've had this restaurant so close to home for two years and didn't even know it. One of my customers at work recommended this place and I'm so glad that he did!

The location is really easy to access from the 215 and is in a shopping center with plenty of parking. We felt very welcome when we arrived and everyone was very friendly. The service was not only friendly, but very efficient. 

We started with the appetizer sampler which was not only delicious, but a very generous size. The sampler included two mini cuban sandwiches, one papas rellenos (mashed potato and meat ball that is breaded and fried), a tamale, and two croquetas. A truly delicious combination. We decided to share the vaca frita (flank steak marinated with lemon, lime, garlic, orange, and spices) with moros (black beans and rice) for our dinner. Everything on the plate was full of flavor and delicious.  I'm already thinking about when I can return. I ended the meal with the vanilla tres leche which had a nice flavor and wasn't soggy. 

What a great place. I can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"foods good, red beans really good. been there twice. the flat steak is great & the waitress was very nice. food is overpriced, too expensive. recommended."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised after reading all of the bad reviews. It seems like the service might be hit or miss here, we got a hit! Me and a girlfriend tried this place after I purchased a Groupon. I was really excited - we have Cuban friends and they've cooked food we consider real comfort food.

We were seated promptly and our drink order was taken. I ordered an original mojito and my friend ordered a mango mojito. When the waiter came over to card us, he flirted with us both, \"No... you're not really over 21? Such youthful faces - very beautiful!\" Needless to say we'd started out on the right foot. 

Moments later our drinks arrived - super fresh mojitos served in little glasses. I was skeptical about the portion size not being enough for me (mojitos being my favorite drink) but it was strong and so flavorful I sipped at it all night without need for another one. When the bill came it was $7.50 for this tiny treasure. Not sure I'd pay that much again - and my friend's flavored mojito cost her $8.50. I wish they wouldn't raise the price a whole dollar for some flavoring. 

I ordered the Arroz Con Pollo (chicken and rice) because it's my theory that they probably had the basic traditional dishes down to a science. I wasn't disappointed. The dish was big enough to split between two people (I think it was $14). The chicken (although dark meat) was tender and fell right off the bone. The rice was flavorful and cooked well, and I can't say enough good things about the fried plantains that came with it. They were cooked perfectly!

My friend had the Vaca... something something. (By the time she explained to me what she'd ordered I think the mojito kicked in.) It was super flavorful shredded chicken served with white rice and black beans. I felt like the chicken was dry when it was alone, but the combination of everything in the dish was wonderful. She had no complaints - ate the whole damn thing. 

We took our sweet time having dinner - we spent well over an hour here and never felt rushed out. Our bill came (52.98 before Groupon), we paid, we left. At the end of the night I was highly satisfied and I'd certainly go back. Not so sure I would order alcohol here again, but it was such a nice addition to the meal that I certainly would be tempted."}
{"text":"Dined at Havana a few times including hosting big family gathering on \"salsa night\". Service can be hit or miss, grandma waited an hour to get her food while everyone else got theirs. I ordered my favorites...pollo ala plancha, plantains, and a mojito. Went there to try their \"$5 lunch specials...figured would take advantage of lower prices since the usual prices are a bit high for the food. Was very disappointed to see items like chicken fingers ( was this meant for kids?!) on their value menu. They could increase business by lowering their prices a bit....$16 for chicken with onions and beans is not the best deal."}
{"text":"I consider to be the best Cuban restaurant in Vegas. It is a bit of a haul for us considering that its sister restaurant, Florida Cafe, is located less than ten minutes from our house, but the food at Havana Grill is a lot better for some reason and therefore worth the drive. Though the service isn't super speedy, you are perfectly occupied with slices of buttered and grilled cuban bread you will need to restrain yourself from finishing. After limiting myself to one piece (ok, one and a half), I had my favorite dish, the ensalada playera ($10 for lunch), which I was glad to see served on a regular plate rather than the ridiculous and impractical shell-shaped bowl it previously was served in. This salad contains small succulent shrimp, ripe avocado, baby tomatoes, roasted red bell peppers, and sliced red onion atop a bed of beautifully assembled mixed field greens, and is served with a mojo dressing that is wonderfully pungent with lemon and garlic. It reminds me of a salad you can get at a good cafe in California where fresh and healthful ingredients parallel intense flavor and a sense of hearty satisfaction. I have no complaints whatsoever about the salad because it is exactly the kind of food I like to enjoy. If you are looking for something a bit more filling without feeling stuffed, however, you should get what my husband got, the pollo alla plancha ($10 for lunch). This is a thinly pounded chicken breast grilled to perfection and served with sauteed onions. The onions could definitely be sauteed longer to get some nice caramelization, but the chicken is great and the accompanying 'moros y cristianos' (black beans and white rice) are to die for! The flavors of the latter meld together with bits of tender pork to create a Cuban staple you'll want to eat over and over again.

Another item we usually get is the Cuban sandwich. In case you've never had one, a Cuban sandwich consists of sliced ham, roast pork, pickles, and swiss cheese pressed on a white Cuban bread loaf spread with mustard until it is warm and melty. The version here is well-executed and tasty, and, although I've had better in New York, we haven't found another in town that compares. They offer it in a half size as well, which would be enough for an appetizer for two or a small meal.

Although the food prices here are fairly reasonable for what you get (dinner gets more expensive), drink prices are absolutely not. Even the Strip can't get away with charging $6 for a Miller Lite, unless perhaps you are at one of the best restaurants, and they generally don't even serve Miller Lite. Even worse, the beer at Havana Grill doesn't come to the table icy cold. Perhaps they are trying to give you a taste for authentic Cuban refrigeration temperatures, but at these prices I want refrigeration you can expect at a Ritz Carlton (or any decent bar). Anyhow, just thought I should let you know what you're in for before you get the bill."}
{"text":"Yummy!!!!!!  The Cuban tamales are delicious - I also had the black bean soup and the papa rellena-
First time visit - order the Mixed plate of appetizers."}
{"text":"Best Cuban food I've had outside of Miami. I grew up there and  the menu brought me back home.  Everything was delicious. Portions were large and had enough to bring home. Can't wait to come back multiple times and eat the entire menu"}
{"text":"THis is one of my favorite places.

LOVE the food,  even though I always just order the same thing, cuban sandwich. and love the long strips of plaintains instead of fries.

the drinks are good.  service at the bar is better than table waiters.

on Fri and Sat nites,  LATE like after 11pm,  the music rocks and after 12 gogo dancers come out, (surprising i know, but adds to the fun atmosphere).

I found the prices fair for the size of the portions.  

still waiting to have the discounted lunches."}
{"text":"Review for a Saturday: This place was recommended from some Vegas locals. We were mainly looking for dinner, latin music, and dancing. FYI the taxi fare from Venetian to Havana was $40 each way! BIG MISTAKE 
We got there at 11pm...Dj playing great music, bar empty, dance floor empty. About 30 ppl total having dinner, some with children. We had reserved a table by dance floor. It's a shame we had dinner and left...back to the strip...no one to dance with at Havanas!
I thought the food was good. My Cuban friend thought she'd had better. Service was slow for a slow night. Music was great but super loud and hard to have a conversation  and had to do more sign and point with waitress when ordering. I would suggest lowering the music (since was more of an eating crowd,and empty dance floor) at least until a good dance crowd would show up."}
{"text":"We went here for an early lunch. No one was present except us which seemed a little awkward. The place is not Cuban in appearance as I am Cuban. It appears it needs some authentic rustic painting instead of palm tree wallpaper. But besides the aesthetics, the food was surprisingly delicious. The server and waiter were very nice. 

The employees treated us like Gold. The Cuban sandwich was authentic and it was nicely presented with a plantain and French fries or plantain chips. 

A pricey lunch of two lunches with two sodas for $30.00. It was authentic though! 

So I will go again probably at night though."}
{"text":"Went with a group after the movie on Sunday afternoon. Nice crowd. Food was average. Service was very spotty. Probably my last visit."}
{"text":"Yet another good experience. The Cuban sandwich is good. Their vinegar garlic dipping sauce is good with the fried plantains. Too bad they ran out on my last visit. That's my favorite."}
{"text":"My friend from Nicaragua would always rave how good & flavorful the food is at Havana Grill. We decided to go for dinner here tonight. We sat at the bar were the bartender by the name of Carlos not only gave us great customer service, but also good after dinner dessert recommendations. I ordered a Mojito, but it was just a little too sweet for my liking. I had to ask for an extra lime wedge, to help adjust the level of sweetness. As for dinner, I just went by what my Nicaraguan friend ordered,  Beef Padilla with Black Beans & Rice. Delicious & cooked to order!! Nice bold flavors with grilled onions & garlic!! We ordered plantains for dessert. The plantains were a delight & my after dinner coffee was exquisite!! It came with a lady finger cookie on the side!! I am eager to come back for happy hour!! The croquetas looked very tasty & on my \"next to try\" list."}
{"text":"2 people, 1 order of vaca frita (yes that is fried cow), a side of yucca with mojo, and a side of sweet plantains, and you got yourself a MEAL!  I have had a few drinks here which are decent, but I love the food.  
I came here once after work to satisfy an extreme craving for yucca with mojo...the waitress was amused.  The owner or manager came and explained to me the twice-cooking process of yucca so I can learn how to make it myself.  He also told me where to get the ingredients for mojo and what they are.  I was pleased!
This is a fun place to go with friends and there are salsa dancing lessons offered in evenings!"}
{"text":"This is a favorite Saturday spot. We love the staff, the service, and all the food. Every dish we have tried here is delicious.  You can't go wrong."}
{"text":"great food, atmosphere, staff.  bar is great for a quick bite or enjoy the full experience in the dining room.  love it when they have entertainment. always feels like your walking into a \"friends\" home for dinner. comfort cuban food"}
{"text":"If you want mediocre food and bad/super slow waiting services, you have come to the right place.  What started the downward slope for me was the fact that they messed up my drink order.  How do you mess up club soda with a lime.  My wife's drink went to another table.  It took about 15 minutes for them to bring us bread or something.  We came to eat and dance.  I guess I have.high expectations as a customer.


The DJ could not make his mind up as to what style of music to play. My daughter can do a better job at mixing the music.  Yes, I have experience as a DJ.  I guess the saving grace here is that there was no cover charge.

The pork was dry. You could tell it had been sitting under the lamp for a while. I should have ordered a sandwich.  

The bus boy was more attentive than anyone else at that place. I should have gotten his name. Nice kid.  Though I told the waitress my club soda was just water, she did not offer to get me another nor refilled my drink throughout the whole dinner.  Save your money and go to the Cuban restaurant near Pawn Stars. I tried this new place and bit me in the ass.  Just so everyone knows, I grew up in Miami eating this type of food so I know what it should taste like when done right.  

Pros,
The place looks nice.  I will give it that."}
{"text":"Great food and excellent service , we drove 30 min just to try this place and we were not disappointed. I'll definitely comeback again ."}
{"text":"Food is good but the service needs work. The servers are nice, but I think there is lack of communication between the floor and the kitchen. Everything took a long time...like a really long time. Ordered 2 Cuban sandwiches and a soda and total dining time was an hour and a half. Would come by only for drinks at the bar now since a bartender is right there, but would not probably be dining in next time. Too bad because the food was good."}
{"text":"Very disappointing. Slow service, unimpressive menu and extremely small portions. Manager was not available until 5 pm. We won't be going back."}
{"text":"Yes, yes, yes! I LOVE this place! So much, I don't know where to begin.

Let's start with the food.  Latin food is my favorite.  The food is packed with flavor! Nothing that will stop my heart right away either.  And there's a perfect amount of it in the food.  I've had  enchilado de camarones and maduros.  I usually order this and pick off others plates.  My, oh my.  Never disappointed with my choices because they always taste so good.  That happy \"this taste so good\" chair dance usually wiggles its way out of me.  Seriously so good and packed with flavor.  All taste buds get in on this action.  When I go with other people, they love it, too. I came here for my birthday, and all guests were well fed.  The table fell silent for a while because we all were so into our plates.  Just heard forks and knives to plates.  Some had never been before and loved it.  They were also pleased with the service.

They are always super friendly! Walk in and there is someone greeting you, sometimes in spanish.  While at your tablem they always come back to check in and make sure everything is going well.  They have a bit of humor as well, which makes the experience better.

Come on the right night and they have live music and salsa! Baya! Can't go wrong with that. A portion of the restaraunt turns into a nightclub and people are movin'! Those with plenty of experience and little to none are on the floor.  I fall into the category of little experience, but I still get out there! 

You can come here eat authentic latin food, and and genuinely have an awesome time, away from the glitz & glam that is the strip."}
{"text":"I gave it one star based on value for the money.  Had the Cuban sandwich that was very good but not 12 bucks worth of good and the fries were frozen so I got the plantain chips.  Red beans and rice were ok but nothing to write home about.   Wife got chicken cubano and it sure wasn't with 14 bucks with the fries. Very bland no garlic flavor as it stated on menu and slight lemon twang.  Pissed off about 40$ for lunch. Place was near empty during lunch so they are probably hurting.  But I can't get any idea of a reason to go back.  They seem to trying but it's not helping"}
{"text":"Listen up YELPERS...

If your in the mood for 

1. Amazing coffee, 2. Strong Mojitos 3. Live music, 4. Dancing 

This is the place for you!"}
{"text":"I've been to Havana Grill several times, so this review is long overdue! I have never had a bad meal there. I tend to stick to the same items, but always make sure to try what everyone else orders. 

They start you off with grilled Cuban bread with butter. It's perfect, served warm and it melts in your mouth. My favorite item on their menu would have to be the Tostones. They are delicious little fried plantain patties topped with chorizo, ropa vieja or shrimp. The ropa vieja tostones are the best! They also have amazing papas rellenas (fried mashed potato balls filled with seasoned ground beef). The last time I went there, the papas were a tad bit too salty. I still enjoyed them though! I ordered the ceviche appetizer as my meal and was pleased with it. It wasn't the best I've had and it could have used more shrimp, but it was good nonetheless. You must also try their red sangria. It's delicious! 

I would highly recommend Havana Grill if you're looking for good food. I'm not an expert on Cuban food, but I have never been disappointed by my meals there."}
{"text":"I came in for lunch and sat for ten minutes without getting my water or having my order taken.  As there were only six tables occupied, I thought that was to long.  I don't like to rate a place strictly on service, but that was unacceptable.  I may return and give them another chance some day."}
{"text":"Finally got to try this place out the other night! Food was delicious and service was great! The portions are huge so lots of left overs for me. The servers were very helpful even took the time to teach me some Spanish! Doesn't hurt they were easy on the eyes :) haha  Definitely will be back for some coffee and latin night!"}
{"text":"Mini Cuban withe fries was excellent.   I still don't like pickle chips.   Take a full pickle and slice it length wise so the whole damn sandwich gets pickle.   That's how it's supposed to be done!"}
{"text":"Horrible service and harassed by the waitress! Came here for a friends birthday so we ordered a pitcher of mojitos, I asked the waitress if it was $30 and she said yes and then asked if I wanted regular or large so I say large. I get my bill and realized I was charged $60 so I ask my waitress about it and she proceeds to tell me \"I asked you if you wanted regular or large, this is not my fault\" so i say fine and pay the amount but leave no tip. The waitress comes next to me to tell me \"if you do not leave a tip, I will WRITE one in for you!\" She harassed me into leaving a tip. Complained and received a $10 gift card to compensate for an $80 bad experience. I do not think I even want to redeem my gift card... sad because I liked this place! Would have not left my review if they had made it up to me, but they did not!"}
{"text":"Aye Carumba, Fantastico!  Yep, I like this place, alot!

1.  Service - Personable, many of staff have been there quite a long time, so they know the menu well, are passionate about what they do, and will recommend the right things for you if you are not sure what to eat.

2.  Food - The chicken, seafood and meat dishes are all great.  We had the Ropa Viejas and the Camerones. They were very tasty. The appetizers I did not have, but have seen them  and they look great.

3.  Drinks - The type of drinks and mixed drinks are great.  Mojitos baby! OK, we had cokes and ice tea.

4.  Dessert - So tasty. We had a chocolate tres leches special that is home made. All their desserts are home made. Wonderful.

5.  Price - Very reasonable.

They also have dancing on the weekends. This is a nice place to relax, go on a date, or just hang with the friends!

Enjoy!!!!!"}
{"text":"Can't count the number of times I've been there. Always fresh and delicious. Great value for the money. Free refills on the soft drinks. Service is above par. Ropa Vieja was excellent plus. Normally I would order it with black beans, but today I changed to red beans which had a lot of pork in it. Think I'll stay with this new choice...red beans. You could easily take home half, but I like to say that a \" Good soldier takes advantage of every hot meal because in combat you never know when you are going to get your next one\". Enjoy this wonderful dinning experience my fiends."}
{"text":"Normally enjoy this place. But it must've been my #hangry-ness affecting my reaction. Called to place an order for pick up to prevent waiting. No one answered. 

Drove down with the intentions to eat instead of pick up. Kudos to Liu, the bartender, who was practically the host (would've eaten in the restaurant if there was a host at the door), server,  and my expo since the one in charge was busy talking to someone and I saw the cook mouth the order and the expo was not even 2 feet away from the window. Liu saw me eyeing my food from the bar, walked over to package it up while the one in charge of expo was still talking and got me on my merry hungry way. So great customer service from the bartender! I'd rate him a 5/5 since he didn't have to do any of it."}
{"text":"My go to for cuban food from now on.  Very relaxed atmosphere and friendly staff!  The vaca frita was delicious and the cortadito was exceptional.   Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Off the freeway and near the theater is Havana Grill, a Cuban-style restaurant that offers free salsa lessons on Sundays and live music on Friday and Saturday nights.

The BF and I went there for dinner last night and I think it's fair to say, this was my first Cuban experience.  

Of all the Cuban-style milkshakes ($4.95) to try, the guanabana was recommended and it was a fabulous choice!  It was sweet, not overly milky, and a nice finish to my dinner.  The BF tried their version of the  Caipirinha (Cachaca, a Brazilian Rum, simple syrup and limes) $7.95.  

Some buttered press-grilled bread was placed before us in a basket as we perused the menu.  For our aperitivo (appetizer), we tried their Mini Sandwich Cubano $6.95.  It's a smaller version of their Cuban sandwich and it's made with tender roasted pulled pork, sliced ham, cheese, dill pickles and mustard on Cuban bread.  It's then press-grilled and served with mariquitas (fried thin green plaintains) or french fries.  It also comes with a garlic lime dipping sauce.  Don't be foolish and get french fries now, go for the plaintains for sure!  

Thus far, our experience at Havana Grill was garnishing a 4 star and I was excited about our entrees.  

The BF had their Boliche Mechado ($14.95), which is slow-cooked roasted eye of the beef round, stuffed with chorizo (Spanish sausage).  It's served with white rice, black or red beans, or moros.  He had them with moros.  The dish was luke-warm and lacked flavor.  If anything, it had an odd plastic wrap aftertaste that didn't fare well.  Same with the moros.  The BF ended up dousing the whole thing with hot sauce.  (I should mention that the waiter commented that this was his favorite dish, so I can only imagine his horror when we covered the whole thing with hot sauce!)

I tried their version of the Lechon Asado ($14.95), which is leg of pork that is slowly oven-roasted and marinated in a mix of lemon, garlic, lime, orange juice and spices.  There are also onions that are mixed into this dish.  I had this with white rice and red beans.  Although my pork was also luke-warm, it was tender and not dry at all.  It had a lot more flavor that the other dish, although my red beans need some kick as well.

Overall, we were more impressed with our Cuban sandwich than our entrees.  Service was okay.  The waiter did come by often to ask how our meal was, but we did have to request that our water glasses be refilled.  Although they didn't advertise that there was live music on a Wednesday night, apparently there was a group practicing that evening.  It might be too loud to carry on a regular conversation when music is being played.  But then again, we figure we might come back to try out their free salsa lessons and grab some other apertivos instead of doing dinner.  Salsa anyone?

{"text":"Tried this place tonight, the music and dancing were already in progress, very hip but also fun for all ages. Since it's a restaurant, the dancing was for all ages, from a child of 8 to an older gentleman of possibly 70. Initially, there was a guy playing guitar and singing for the early part of dinner time then by ten at night, the DJ came out to play a variety of dance music, befitting the clientele and venue. The servers were polite and courteous, the food was delish and a good size portion for the price. Overall, we liked it and will sure to return with more fam and friends to make the night much livelier"}

Authentic Cuban fare that deserves five stars!"}
{"text":"I took my wife, grand daughter and a neighbor to Havana Grill's Latin night for my grand daughter's upcoming 19 birthday coming of age sort of night out. She had her hair & make up done and had a beautiful dress on. She loves Latin music. The food was ok. I had a Mini Sandwich Cubano which was so so. My Wife had soup and a salad which was good and my grand daughter had nachos. I was the only one to eat all my food and my wife and grand daughter barely touched theirs. When we were ready to leave I asked the waitress to box our food to take home. She took our food away but rather than box it up she threw it all out. My wife tried to tell me she threw our food out but I told her that I said I wanted to take our food home. Well, my wife was right. Our food went into the kitchen and never came back. On top of that, when we when we left, we didn't understand that they added a mandatory tip to the bill. The waitress chased us down in the parking lot demanding that we give her our choice of a 12%, 15% or 18% tip. They don't tell you this when you order. When I go out, I decide if the waitperson gets a tip and how much not the other way around. The place had a nice family atmosphere, nice dance floor and the little we ate of our food was good, which is the only reason I don't give them one star, but to throw away our food instead of letting us take it home and then chasing us down in the parking lot to demand a minimum 12% tip left a very bad taste in my mouth. We're locals. This is not the first time we've been to Havana Grill. However, it may be our last. If anyone at Havana Grill reads this, if you ever want to see us again I feel we, at minimum, deserve an apology. If it was my restaurant I would have the class to make it right. Well, we'll see what they do if anything."}
{"text":"Yo. Dude. Seriously. Surrrrrriously. Do it now. Maduros! Moro! Vaca frita de pollo! Mojitos! This joint is POPPIN! The Havana Mojito has pineapple juice in it. Dope! The lady with us got tip tip tipsy off dem sangrias! Then she sang Gria!! Whoop! Yo. Seriously tho. Food is baller. Stop sleepin."}
{"text":"Went by today to have some drinks before a movie. It's 6:30pm, doors are locked, no sign explaining why. Yelp says it's still open. Least they could do is provide an explanation."}
{"text":"I love Cuban food, so when I saw the groupon deal I bought it quick.  The seating in this place is horrible.  Too many tables and they seat you practically on top of the people next to you.  The server and patron behind me kept bumping into my chair.  I finally got up and moved to the other side of the table.  The whole restaurant was pretty empty, maybe 10% full but they sat us next to a party of 10 so we couldn't even hear each other speak.  I kept feeling myself lean in to hear my boyfriend even though we were seated right next to each other.  

The server dropped off our mediocre food and that was the last time we saw him until we were finished.  So, no refills on our drinks plus the extra ketchup we asked for at the beginning didn't come until we were finished.  The food was okay, nothing special.  I've had Cuban food all over, including Miami and Little Havana.  This place is WAY OVERPRICED for average food.  I also can't believe that the Palomilla Empanizada was $16 and doesn't come with maduros - that's an extra $4 BUT it does come with a little salad with no dressing - just about 5 pieces of lettuce, tomatoes and onion. 

I think the biggest disappointment of the night was the seating and that the entrees don't come with maduros...hello - I've NEVER eaten at a Cuban restaurant that doesn't include maduros with the entree.  An extra $4 for a half a plantain - give me a break!

I think the true rating should be 1 1/2 but that's not an option.  The food was average so it deserves a 2 but everything else deserves a 1."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Cuban joint in Vegas. Food, service, inside atmosphere and location was cool. Price is reasonable and plenty of parking spaces. If you're ever in Vegas and craving for some authentic Cuban food or would like to try Cuban food for the first time, then this is a good place to go. However, it's about 20+ mins drive from the Strip area."}
{"text":"I really wanted to try this place. I live Cuban food, and I figured this would be my go to. Unfortunately, the food was not good. My husband isn't familiar with Cuban food, so he decided to order salmon. I ordered Havana chicken and tostones for the table. 

The salmon was terribly salty, the Havana chicken was so bland that I just took it home to make something else with it. It was moist though. The tostones we're friend so hard, we couldn't bite into them. It was like eating a rock. All in all, the meal cost $63, and was very disappointing. Then, we waited almost 20 minutes  for the bill. I will not returning. My suggestion is save your money and time."}
{"text":"50% off at lunch time.
Good bread with butter.
Food was ok.
Nice atmosphere though."}
{"text":"This place is one of our favorites. Very accommodating for any size group. They also do separate checks for large parties. But best of all their food is delicious. Definitely a place we will continue to frequent."}
{"text":"I have been here a couple of times and i love it my husband is cuban and im mexican so this restaurant fits our liking the servers are almost very attentive i love it !!"}
{"text":"By the picures shown..the Camarones Al Ajillo looks good. Though I haven't tried this location yet..I think I might try them! Their other location sucks..I'm glad they finally got the message to state their Mexican food items \"as such\".  Its hard to find a good totally authentic Cuban meal in Vegas! They'll usually mix in Argentinean..Italian and Mexican without identifying this...Cuban food is very unique and it has Spanish and French origins. I hate when they try to mix other origins in, when Cuban by itself is just fine!  Will update once I try them!"}
{"text":"Trying this place out with my Cuban friends. Heard this was the place to be for Cuban food so why not. They have exceptional food here! I got the picadillo and it was amazing. Service was a little slow that's why I gave them 3 stars. Should not take 20 minutes to get water to the table, but oh well. The food was exceptional so it makes up for it. I would recommend and come here again."}
{"text":"Do your taste buds a favor and come to this place it's fantastic very reasonable authentic Havana food and the even have a band and patio seating on the weekend. Even a dance floor"}
{"text":"A friend suggested we meet here- glad she did!
This restaurant brings the food of my Friend's childhood- she's a crazy Cuban;)
Flavorful, traditional dishes and some with a Mexican twist! 
Crunchy plantains, savory sauces AND timely and pleasant service!  Crafted mojitos and the bartender ensures the cocktails were to our liking.  She even had us test tasting some of the other creations she makes behind the bar- bonus!  
Started with some slices of pressed, oh so warm and delicious Cuban bread. 
OH the croquetas and that creamy inside filling!  Havana Grill has me at the croquetas. 
Be sure and try the mini Cubano sandwiches as well- just save some room of that entree!
I had the salmon with taste awakening dipping marinades for me to choose from.      All were made from scratch and sleuthed my taste buds.  Salmon cooked perfectly and the side of black beans- oh my;). 
A lovely lady (who turned out to be the owner) was whipping up some caffeine all by hand and provided us with her delectable Cuban caffeine delights!  No winner between the two- both were tasty!
Yes, they have HH aka happy hour from 4pm-7pm; a nice spacious outdoor patio as well!"}
{"text":"Definitely the best cuban restaurant in Vegas. I have been there multiple times and they are even better every time."}
{"text":"We've been going here for years.  Used to be good service, good food.  Today, only good food.  We stood at the hostess stand a few minutes, a server with a tray excused himself between us to deliver a tray, not once saying \"Just a minute folks.\"  We waited, and finally asked the bartender \"Should we just take any seat?\"  He nodded, and so we did, grabbing our own menus from the hostess stand.  As soon as we sat down, a blaring narrator came over the PA system from a current fad class in drinking and painting.  The instructor boomed over the PA system, drowning out the restaurant's music playing overhead.  We ordered croquetas, papas rellenas, black bean soup, and arroz con pollo.   Delicious!  If only we could have had a conversation together over the din of the art instructor giving painting instructions to the 20 or so drinking/painting students.  Must've been some marketing gig to get people in on a Tuesday evening.  The service was terrible.  Delivered chicken soup rather than black bean.  Corrected.  Never once refreshed our water glasses or asked if we needed another delicious mojito.  This place is slipping in service.  Sorry to see this.  The food is still good, but the service sucks."}
{"text":"Food is great here .... keeps me coming back . Chicken is juicy flavorful n the arroz morro is delicious (I had to check the kitchen , thought they had my mom back there cooking the rice)"}
{"text":"The ambiance is great. Friendly employees and the owner greets you on entering. They take your order quickly and the drinks are strong. Passion mojito Your welcome . The portions are nicely sized. The pressed steak w sauteed sweet onions perfectly done. The rice was sweet and the beans were delicious."}
{"text":"Came to see Caseroloops, the Venezuelan Grammy-nomiated band. The band itself was good, but I can see the Havana Grill has taken a dive lately. I remember when this place used to be packed every weekend with live bands and a 'happening' atmosphere, taste appetizers available until late, and fruity mojitos. This time around, the atmosphere was dead (except for the band playing), the mojitos were expensive ($9 ) and watered down, and I believe the kitchen had already closed. I am not quite sure what happened.

If I had to vote this place thumbs up or down, it would the latter. I can't imagine going there and having much fun, given the stale overall atmosphere. Now I have to find another latin music spot."}
{"text":"Food was ok, Vaca Frita tasted like salt and service was horrible!  Mojitos start at $8.50? Drink prices reminded me of the price gouging strip casinos. Service was so bad we skipped dessert...."}
{"text":"Why only 3 stars, guys?  I thought this  place was like a trip to Miami without the jet lag. Brought a Cuban food virgin along- we love it. The Bistek de Palomilla and the Old Man's Clothes (beef)- can't remember the Spanish name. Roja de Viejo or something like that. Both very tasty. The Yuca Frita was great too. Didn't have drinks at lunch, can't comment on that."}
{"text":"I have become that person that does not experiment and am dead set on finding the best arroz con pollo in town. Havana Grill might not be as good as what I would eat at a childhood friend's house, but it was tasty. The rice was flavorful without being too salty or overly seasoned. The chicken was moist and fall off the bone tender. The plantains were cooked to perfection. The three pieces were soft, sweet, and not dried out. There have been many times where I go to a Cuban restaurant to be disappointed in finding that their plantains have the consistency of Styrofoam. The plates are large and can easily feed two people. I ordered this with a side of the steamed yucca. Yucca is a root vegetable that is mellow in flavor. It could have used some citrus to make it taste bolder. The onions on top adds a nice contrast in texture. So far, Havana Grill serves one of the better arroz con pollo I have had in a restaurant. My friend had ordered the chicken simmered in red wine with potatoes and olives. This was the better dish of the two. Served with black beans and rice, it is a great deal at $12."}
{"text":"My wife, along with some friends and I came here for a night out. The ambience was absolutely delightful. Live music, in addition to amazing service, great food, and very tasty drinks, made for the perfect evening. I highly recommend Havana Grill; the restaurant is a gem."}
{"text":"Last Friday after work I met up with 3 friends I haven't seen for a few months to catch up over drinks and appetizers.  First of all, the food was bland.  Secondly, and most important, the service was awful.  Water refills were hard to get.  But here is the real kicker, which I must preface with the fact that the restaurant had low to moderate occupancy.  After an hour and a half, a female staff member approached our table, placed her hands on her hips, shot us a don't mess with me look, and barked, \"Do you want anything else??\"  She might as well have said GTFO biznatches!  We left with the quickness and won't be returning."}
{"text":"Food is really good but the service is extremely slow. It took 15 minutes to get a server to order food and 20 minutes just for the appetizer to come to the table. The main course took 45 minutes to get to the table. The restaurant needs to improve their staff."}
{"text":"I had about 45 mins to kill before the movie and decided to stop in and have dinner. Well I should have known standing there at the front for about 1 minute without being acknowledged , was a sign of what was to come. I made my way over to the bar and got seated, still no acknowledgement by the waitress who was either ringing up an order or getting someone their bill. I had high hopes for this place, but the lack of service left me with a poor taste in my mouth."}
{"text":"My wife and I loved this restaurant. The food was delicious. And the Cuban atmosphere was completely authentic. Servers were wonderful and kind. Plus, most of our servers and employees that we encountered were actually Cuban which I really appreciated. Speed of service was also timed ideally.

I lived in Miami for two years and I've missed this sort of a restaurant since then (5 years ago). The Ropa Vieja tasted like it was made by a Cuban abuelita.

We plan to go there next week to check out the live music and I will update this review then."}
{"text":"Very yummy food and great ambiance with the live music. The acoustic guitar player was amazing and had a beautiful voice that was just the right volume so you can still chat without having to scream to be heard. It had been a few years since I had been here so I was a bit surprised that they have added a whole new Mexican section to the menu. I feel like that kind of defeats the purpose of going out for Cuban food just to order nachos so we stuck with the more traditional section of the menu. My friend and I ordered the lechon asada as well as the fricase de pollo to share. The lechon asada was this delicious savory pork dish but the fricase was pretty dry and didn't have much flavor in comparison. A little disappointed that they didn't have the traditional guava pastries for dessert, however, not a deal breaker and it would not deter me from coming back."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for at least 10 years but never wrote a review. Bottom line it's where I always take guests when they're in town because I know it's going to be great food, great service and great experience. I always get the lechon asada al despolote, I've even tried to recreate the dish myself at home (with zero success ) 
Bottom line, make sure you end up eating here to have some great Cuban food. You'll never regret coming to this restaurant."}
{"text":"My Cuban friend recommended this place, saying it was authentic. I can't vouch for authenticity, since I haven't had much Cuban, but my tastebuds were happy. 

We ordered Lechon Asado (roasted leg of pork marinated in citrus juices and sauteed with onions) and the Arroz con Pollo (Cuban chicken with rice). Both dishes were tasty. Next time, I will try Polla a la Plancha (\"Boneless chicken breast pounded and marinated in tropical citrus juices and sautéed on the flat griddle with onions\"). The plantains were deliciously perfect (good texture, not too greasy, sweet). Portions were generous.

Havana Grill is a good, solid place. Service, ambiance, food -- todo bueno*! 

*(Todo bueno except the bread they served, which could have been buttered more, but it's just bread, and it was ok. Of course, I could ask for more butter, and I'm sure they'd be happy to oblige. The servers were very friendly, professional, and accommodating.)

Family-friendly restaurant (noticed some families with small children) and it appears, from the website and the buzz here on Yelp, that they have dancing on Fridays and Saturdays. From the website, it also says: \"Happy Hour, Tuesdays to Sundays, From 4pm to 7pm, At 50% OFF - All Drinks\""}
{"text":"There should be a system to judge based on service too and not just food. The food would get a 4 star and the service would be a 0. The food was very tasty but it took awhile to even get and to order. We sat at the bar and there was one other couple there with us.

They were already paying to leave but it still took the bartender a while to get our drink orders. 
After that we waited a while longer to be able to put in our food order. We got our chips n salsa after about 8 minutes of waiting, which is fine but really, there was two tables on the main floor and the other server kept hiding somewhere in the back. People at the table had to come up to the bar to ask for their check. 

After we got our food a guy came in and the server was too busy talking to him to pay attention to anyone else. My husband just wanted another beer. My mojito has no alcohol in it. I would know, I'm a 110 pound light weight who usually can only handle one drink since I become bright red and semi drunk, the drink just tastes like sour juice and sugar, I didn't even get a light buzz or redness. My husband gave up on the beer and we decided to just Togo the rest of the food to go home and eat it. 

It was very unfortunate for the restaurant owner because the cook was very good but if their servers and bartenders are not performing, it drives customers away."}
{"text":"We love Havana Grill! We go here for lunch every time we're in Vegas (about once a month) and we always leave happy. We used to go to Florida Cafe (connected to Howard Johnson Inn on the north end of the strip) but it's a bit of a trek for us and parking is always difficult in our oversized truck. So when we discovered Havana Grill has the same owner we were thrilled. Everything we've tried from the menu has been delicious. And the mojitos are amazing. The back patio seating is really nice in the cool months."}
{"text":"Great Cuban sandwiches love it!!! Excellent service great atmosphere did take out on a rainy day but will be coming back to enjoy a great dinner evening with hubby."}
{"text":"Great food and great service! Havana Grill, your food doesn't hold a candle to my moms authentic Cuban cooking but it's the next best thing! Love the place!"}
{"text":"Boy, I was very underwhelmed by Havana Grill.  First of all, I've been primed for a good Cuban sandwich for at least a year. I've seen them on Anthony Bourdain's shows and Andrew Zimmern's, and they look juicy and scrumptious. I guess those were the made-for-TV versions, because the one I got here wasn't much different from something I could have gotten from a deli.  

I've since looked up \"Cuban sandwich\" online and the Havana Grill's offering looks pretty much the same as the images I find on Google.  Damn you, travel shows, for raising my expectations!   Honestly, if someone had handed me one of these at work or something, the most I would have thought was, well, the bread is interesting. Not a bad sandwich, but nothing memorable. 

My friend had fries with her sandwich and they were basic fries.  I had the fried plantains and liked them: crisp, not too thick, and not oversalted.  

Two friends ordered the ropa vieja- one had chicken and the other tried pork. They were kind enough to give me a taste, and I must say, the sauce for these dishes was delicious! It came with beans and rice, and those beans were very tasty as well. 

I forgot to mention the appetizers: we tried papas rellenas and tostones.  The papas (sort of like fried balls of mashed potatoes with a small filling of meat) were interesting  but I thought the flavor was just kind of \"meh\"- again, not memorable. I was not fond of the tostones- the fried green plantains. In fact, none of us ate much of those.  For me, they just had very little flavor.  One thing we gobbled up, though, was the buttered bread!  Very good bread. 

As for beverages, one of us tried the mojito and gave it a big thumbs up.  Another tried the raspberry margarita and although she can put away a drink, she didn't finish this one.  (She was also surprised that it came with salt on the rim rather than sugar. I don't know about such things, since I'm not much of a drinker).

The restaurant had a spacious, open feel  because the tables aren't crowded together. The tropical-themed leaf ceiling fans were kind of nice, too.  Simple, non-fussy wood tables and chairs add a casual flair.   

OH - I have to add that service was V E R Y  S  L O W.  The servers (all good looking, - like GQ good looking)  took forever just to put the bread baskets on the table - even after we asked for it.  It took a long time to get our orders taken.  Upon check out, they mistakenly added a gratuity to the bill. Correcting the error took almost 20 minutes because of one or two other errors made during the correction of the first problem. Aggravating!

After 9pm the loud music began, thanks to two DJs spinning (well, spinning hard drives, at least) some hearty Latin dance music. By 10 pm the dance floor was dark and the party was in full swing, with folks young and old doing all sorts of couples dancing. I picked up a few new songs thanks to Soundhound, and enjoyed watching people through the laser-lights.  I also had fun watching my friend get her butt smacked by a 70 year old woman on the dance floor!  We decided we'd come back for the music, the bar, and dancing, but would be less likely to return for the food."}
{"text":"Nice upscale Cuban restaurant. My beautiful one and I were on the south side of town just hanging out on a Saturday afternoon and we decided to have a late lunch here. First,  wonderful authentic decor with easy listening music. Atmosphere and Ambience very laid-back. She ordered Tamal en casuela soup and I ordered Pan con Bistec with banana chips accompanied by lemon and garlic sauce. The presentation of the food was very impressive. Sampled a bit of her soup texture was very .good moist very tasty soup. My steak sandwich was awesome very moist onions sweet sauteed just right. Banana chips with fried lightly was a very good distinctive taste with the lemon and garlic sauce.  Service was very nice."}
{"text":"Idk why I went in thinking it was a high end Latin restaurant, I think it's a bit tacky to charge for nachos and salsa while you wait for your order. The costumer service was excellent, but the dj was way off he would go from Latin to hip hop super randomly. I ordered nacho macho (carne Asada nachos) it was all night, meh, oh yeah pricy btw"}
{"text":"There are not many Cuban places to eat at in the Las Vegas Valley and my uncle would be disappointed if I didn't have ropa vieja every now and again. This place has friendly services and a great atmosphere. The food is the closest to home cooked Cuban food. I have come to eat with mi Tia and my favorite friends Ben & Julie. 
I have had a cuba libre and my ropa vieja very time. Go in ready to enjoy the cuban music. 

Note: This is one of the few in town and I do not have anything to compare it to in town."}
{"text":"I am usually here for happy hour with friends, so we're always at the bar (outdoor bar space is great when it's not too hot!) and always well taken care of.

Drinks: Fresh, flavorful, and flowing. Whether going more tradicional and ordering mojitos or sangria or whether you want somehing more cosmopolitan (dirty martinis are always a good choice!), these bartenders know what they are doing. Lots of flavor, lots of fuel, and lots of smiles.

Food: The fried plantains are crispy, have a nice fresh taste, and were perfectly salted. We've had a few types of dips and salsas with these, depending on the mood of the group or the proprietor (specials, etc.) and have yet to find one we didn't like.

The slow roasted pork was tasty if a bit on the chewy side. I don't know if they needed a better cut of meat or more time in the cooker. Either way, it was flavorful but the texture made it less than a \"I'll fight you for the rest\" kind of dish.

The tamal was tasy and the masa was good, but there is just not enough meat to make this any more than a masa dish... think polenta with a cuban flair. I wanted more filling and more of their delicious sauces. Fell flat. Totally something I can see them improving... and I hope they do.

Service is always great, either because our group tends to draw the servers in or because they are just that good. Either way, it works for us! The matriarch/owner is always sweet, keeping watch over his home away from home. Great energy from a great staff.

It's not phenomenal (it doesn't have to be), and I prefer the food over at Cuba Cafe. However, it's a solidly good, A-OK, happy hour joint that I look forward to visiting again."}
{"text":"Went to check out Happy Hour today.  Jany was the bartender and she was fantastic.  So friendly and helpful.  We know nothing about Cuban food and she helped us make great selections from the happy hour menu.  Husband loved Cuban sandwich, I loved the  croquettas and Papas fritas.  Great value and great food will definitely go back"}
{"text":"While the food and drinks are good, the service is absolutely horrendous each and every time I've gone here. If you're going for a special occasion just don't because the service alone will ruin your night. The servers are very friendly, however, the kitchen staff is extremely slow. Entrees are brought out one by one so a person in your party gets their food 20 minutes before the next. Just get takeout."}
{"text":"I really love this restaurant! I will definitely be coming back soon! This was my first time. The weather was nice, so we sat in the patio. They did have the fans on which helped a lot. But, as it got darker and darker, it became more beautiful and cooler. On Friday and Saturday nights, they have dancing!

We ordered many different things. Most of which I really liked. The avocado stuffed with shrimp was delicious, it also had a very delicious sauce. I also loved the plantains. \"Platanos Maduros.\" But, my favorite where the potato balls. \"Papas rellenas!\" Mashed potatoes stuffed with meat on the inside and fried. Also, the dessert was amazing. It does have a name that will make you blush. You'll know what I mean when you see it!

The service was excellent. There was a pretty woman with long hair helping us. She was very knowledgeable and she tried to help us make the better choices. She was also checking up on us frequently. The best boy was also a big help and very courteous."}
{"text":"I'm from Las Vegas and every time I am home I try soo hard to get to Havana Grill!  

I am absolutely OBSESSED with their black bean soup!  It's amazing.  I always order a bowl instead of a cup because it's a large portion, and it takes everything in me to save half to take home.  Something about the spices in this soup are too perfect.  I also always ask for extra onions on top. I love it, I love it, I love it!

For lunch, I will always get the Bistec sandwich (half size).  It's very tasty and very filling, especially after my soup.  The bread it comes on is buttered, garlicy, and toasted.  For my side, I usually get fries (I don't even like fries that much, but I do like them here at Havana Grill), and my Mom always gets the plantains.  Their plantains are on point!!  

I only wish they were open on Mondays, too!"}
{"text":"I've been spoiled with great cuban food before.  This place was terrible.  The food was bland and inedible.  Even the mojitos were bad - they are made with a mix and they didn't even crush the mint leaves.  It's too bad because the restaurant is very nice looking and the service is great."}
{"text":"Being from Miami and being Cuban American, I am definitely somewhat of an authority on cuban food. With that said, this fell short of the real thing... WAA WAA.... 
I ordered a ton of food, to go for myself and some friends of mine. I have been raving about Cuban food and was excited to share my culture and was let down. The main dishes (the meat) was actually decent - we shared fried steak or Vaca Frita (right on with the flavor) and breaded chicken-Pollo empanisado. However ALL the side dishes tasted frozen or packaged. The congri or arroz moros were NOT home made and the platanos were definitely from frozen banaas. The tostones (salty, fried plantains) tasted chalky (frozen) and the mojo (sauce for the fried plantains) wasn't even close to authentic mojo. Mojo is literally the easiest thing to make, why not make it fresh! Maybe I am overly critical because I have grown up with Cuban food and have had TRULY authentic versions (out of my grandmothers kitchen) but, this was so SAD... 

Oh well, Miami is only a plane ride away.

By the way- It shouldn't take an hour to put food together, for a to-go order when you phoned in the order, thirty minutes prior."}
{"text":"Nice place, check, good mojitos, check, check, good service, triple check.  Aaaand they play live music after 11pm and have room to dance on Fridays.  Lechon Asado, mmm, yummy.  Fried yucca (manioc/casava) with mojo, even yummier.  Paella, very good.  Great time, great looking restaurant.  I'm a happy camper."}
{"text":"We brought a bunch of people to Havana Grill because it used to be my favorite restaurant, until now! No longer real Cuban food! I'm fairly certain they got bought out by Florida café. this is one place in town I knew I could go to get real authentic Cuban food, I am sad to say this is no longer the case! We are in a Cuban sandwich there were no pickles! Ordered the tamales had zero flavor, I so missed the sweetness of the Cuban tamale! The worst part of it all was when I ordered a Cafecito (traditional Cuban coffee) she asked me if I wanted expresó or regular coffee, and then if I wanted milk and sugar. I don't know what it was that she brought me but it was not a cafecito. There was zero language barrier! I am Cuban and by nature Spanish is my first language! So disappointed!"}
{"text":"Took advantage of Groupon offer and was really hoping past experiences would not be repeated in regards to service.  Food as usual was just okay but service continues to be horrible.  Upon being seated, our waiter took care of patrons that came AFTER us...okay possibly an honest mistake.  But then our waiter NEVER checked back with us until the very end of our meal...inexcusable!!!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing my hubby is Cuban but we rarely get Momma's cooking SO THIS WAS A TREAT !!!! The flavors are phenomenal !!! Everything was cooked super fresh Delicious delicious will definitely be coming here a lot !!!! Service also was outstanding"}
{"text":"I just went to Havana Grill for the first time and sadly it will be my last. I did not personally get to order any of their food off of the menu, however I did get to try their free bread they give you before your meal is delivered and I have to say that was tasty. I also ordered their passion mojito and that was good albeit pricey. 

My bad experience was with the staff of the restaurant. We were in a semi-large group of people sitting on the patio, ordering lots of appetizers, food and alcohol. Apparentely there was an incident up front with one person of our group (who wouldn't turn his hat around) and they kicked him out. We had no idea that incident took place and the General Manager stormed back to our table and told us to all leave. We were treated so horribly and were being screamed at by the GM (can you say embarrasing?!) and we had no clue what was even going on. We had to leave that second with our drink cups full, food still on our plate AND still had to pay our bills with the 18% gratuity conveniently tacked on the check. 

I have filed a complaint with the owner and will never step foot in there again. If you are brave enough to give it a shot then I can only hope your experience is better than mine. Such a disappointment..."}
{"text":"This is always a great place to pop in for Happy Hour. The Masas de Puerco and Mojitos are excellent, and the staff always treat us like friends that they are happy to see."}
{"text":"We just returned to Havana Grill after not eating there for several months. The food was delicious. The sangria was one of the best I've had in town. They have live entertainment Friday through Sunday, what a fabulous singer and guitar player he is. All his songs were wonderful. The fans were on, the sangria flowing  and we almost felt like we were on one of the islands. Service was superb.  We felt the pricing was very fair for the quality of food we were served. Looking forward to trying them out for lunch."}
{"text":"Lunch is nice and quiet around Havana Grill with plenty of seating and an attentive staff.  I absolutely LOVE the Ropa Vieja here with some fried plantains on the side.  Scrumptious!"}
{"text":"Knowing this was a Cuban-Mex fusion, I did not have high hopes for this restaurant.  I came here not reading any reviews, because this was the chosen dinner spot and that's that.  =)

I ordered the lechon asado, knowing well I would only return if this dish was done right.  The plate came out with a side of salad, black beans, a mound of white rice shaped by the bowl and finally the decent amount of pork served on another bowl.  Why a bunch of bowl and not just served on the plate?  I don't know.  The marinated onions that are sour,  pairs so well with the semi-shredded pork dish.  Tender meat, great flavors, decent portion and I'm sold.

We had an order of yuca, reminds me of my childhood.  We used to make a hot dessert with tapioca and cubed yuca, which made this dessert a wonderful winter treat.  This yuca is cooked down so the starchy root is perfect with a fork, marinated over olive oil, a drizzle of cheese and a whole load of marinated thin sliced onions rings.  Drool!!!  This was an excellent side dish, if you love yuca.

The ropa vieja (shredded beef) was on point and my husband really enjoyed his dish too.  He opted for moros (mixed black bean and rice) and devoured the dish because it was delicious. 

The plantains were buttery sweet, unfortunately doesn't come with the dish, but as a side order.  

The verdict- Comparing this to Cuban restaurants to the ones in California, I would say they are on par.  Also, if you're into Latin night, they have an area for live music, possibly dancing on one of the weeknights."}
{"text":"A great place to grab some tasty Cuban food. Lunch portions are generous. It did have a funny smell when we entered, but it may have just been the day. Not sure."}
{"text":"Went here with two dinner companions the other night - 5/10/13.  It was late, so I had one of the appetizer platters for my dinner.  It consisted of one tamale, one papa rellena, 2 croquetas, and one mini-Cuban sandwich.  The appetizers were okay, but nothing impressive, One of my companions had a beef entree and the other a chicken entree - I sampled both and both were quite tasty. My difficulty came about with the wine.  I asked for a glass of Pinot Grigio, priced at $7 on the wine menu. First, I got a Pinot Noir, and sent that back.  I had a second glass of the same.  When the check came, each glass was priced at $11 - $4 more for each glass!  After a conversation with the waitress, she went off and talked to someone, and refunded us $6 on the bill.  What happened to the other $2?  It got taken out of her tip - if they can't do math better than that, too bad.  Very disappointing in how it was handled.  Then they were setting up for dancing later - there were many still dining, but that didn't stop the staff from noisily moving tables, chairs, rearranging furniture repeatedly, and otherwise giving the indication that dining (apparently) was no longer their priority.  Really?"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in Vegas!! I can't believe all of the bad reviews I'm seeing about this place. I grew up with friends of all ethnicities and Cuban being one, so I must say I've had a lot of Cuban food to know the real deal and this place is definitely the real deal!! The employees are all super friendly, and the service is great! I've been here maybe 20 times and I've never had a bad experience.

The food is absolutely delicious. I've had many different things on the menu and every dish I've ordered, I LOVED!! My personal favorite items on the menu are : Moros y christianos, yuca al mojo con chicharrones, mariquitas, pan con bistec, bistec de palomilla, pollo a la plancha and the arroz con pollo. 

There were some complaints about the prices and the dishes being too small?... I definitely disagree with that. I've never gotten a meal from there that didn't leave me anything but OVERLY FULL!!! Side dishes range from $3 to $6. Sandwiches are $11-$13. Main entrees $14- $18. I think the prices are reasonable for the amount of food and the quality of food and the service that you get. 

I love havana grill!!!"}
{"text":"First time here 4/30 for a friends birthday. They were crowded but it was a nice blended crowd, families, all ages and races. I really liked the environment and ambiance of this place. There was Music and dancing, I think that its only on weekends. It took a long time to get service, and I was okay with it at first because it was a full night. When I finally did get a menu, it was after about 15 -20 minutes. An additional 15-20 minutes to get her to stop to take our order. I had stop her to ask her are you taking orders because she never asked and continued to walk past. It took about 35 minutes to get the food in the time she didn't come back to ask if we wanted new drinks. Which were ordered when we first walked in. When we got the food, one of the meals was wrong, it mentioned it to the server that brought the food out but the person told him it was fine since she didn't want to wait another 30 minutes to eat. After we ate, we finally flagged her down for new drinks. She was going to keep walking. When she brought the bill and when we chose not to pay the SUGGESTED tip. However she WAS tipped. She came back to ask why she was not tipped the amount suggested that she had circled on the bill. I was really shocked.. I told her why and she said she understood and but why didn't we tell her ?? It took you 30+ Minutes to even take our order !!  It was very audacious of her to approach me that way. Her name was Eunice. Other than that .. I really like the place and intend to return, maybe it was a bad night for her."}
{"text":"I use to love this place and I was craving for Lechon Asado so we drove a good 20 minutes to have lunch.
I ordered the lunch special Lechon asado  with rice and black beans and sweet plantain. My guest ordered Fried chicken which we ask if it is white meat and the waitress said \"yes\". We also asked if it comes with plantain and she said \"no but I'll ask the kitchen to throw in a few pieces. 

The food came rather quick which is impressive but that's about it. My asado taste a little stale and the plantain is over riped that it should not be served anymore. My friends chicken came with a leg and thigh and not white meat. The over riped plantain she got was later on charged as a side for $5 extra. I guess thats what she meant when she said I'll put a few pieces. Never mentioned we will be charged. 

A very disappointing lunch altogether. Another place that deteriorate in service and taste instead of maintaining their quality. I will not come back anymore."}
{"text":"We decided to give this place a try because we are big fans of Florida cafe in Downtown Las Vegas and we were not disappointed. We also found out that both places have the same owner. Their mojitos are a must! So refreshing and tasty. We ordered chicken fajitas. The portion was pretty big! I am not a big fan of Cuban/Mexican cuisine but I really loved this place. I will come back with great pleasure."}
{"text":"I like to find the Cuban places and one of my favorite sandwiches, the Cuban! The mini  Cuban on the menu is wonderful, Add a bit more sauce and it would be perfect for me. The Bread appetizer was warm and perfect. The Chicken soup is chunky enough  and flavorful. With the lemon squeeze (I would have preferred lime) it is quite enhanced. All in all - I am coming back to test a few more items and enjoy the lovely ambiance and snappy service. Live Music on Friday and Saturday and I want to be part of that, but that will be another trip."}
