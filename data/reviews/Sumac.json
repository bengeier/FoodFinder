{"text":"Have been there twice! Once when busy and once when empty. The food is up to par with other reviews here. Original, succulent and all around excellent. I personally like the original ordering system, but it can be complicated with large groups. Maybe they should have two lines for ordering in or take-out, that might help the process along."}
{"text":"Resto sympa et très abordable! À essayer: le falafel, la salade de quinoa et les frites sumac...tous excellents!"}
{"text":"Great portions, great prices. The falafels were amongst the tastiest and crispiest I've ever had. The chicken was moist and tender. The little mini pitas were warm and fresh. Everything sprinkled with sumac. The salads could use a little touch of love, i.e. a little more flavour, but wonderful that they offer ~6 salads to choose from. The hummus fries are just fries dumped with hummus, good- but I would suggest ordering fries with a side of hummus for dipping. Hummus was mediocre. Counter service, nice space, clean with a very minimalist look. I'll come again."}
{"text":"Miam miam miam...épices superbement balancées, bouffe dinspiration libanaise  exquise en bouche! Assiettes généreuses, il faut etre en appétit!"}
{"text":"Sumac's baba ghanouj is the best I have had in Montreal (and probably in my life!) ... also highly recommend the muhammara dip, which is a heavenly walnut and red pepper mix with pomegranate molasses. The warm and fluffy pita is a perfect complement to both of these, as well as the hummus. The falafel is very tasty, but special shout out for the stewed tomato salad and the eggplant harissa salad. Both are muy delicious! 
My experiences in restaurant and as catered take-out have been wonderful. Service is consistently good and order a half and half homemade lemonade / iced tea...top notch!
Very cool locale also; the restaurant tends to get busy on end of week nights and remember to check the schedule because the number of times I have showed up on a Monday only to find it closed is killer...Overall very good and worth the trek from anywhere!"}
{"text":"Really good take on Middle Eastern food with some of the best falafels I've ever had.  Plates were plentiful, and all the dishes we had were very well made.  I would also highly recommend trying the house made drinks (iced tea and lemonade), which were both really good separately and mixed together (a la Arnold Palmer style).  The only thing I would critique is the hummus, which tasted more like straight pureed chickpeas without enough the usual hummus seasonings (lemon, tahini, spices) and also wasn't as creamy as hummus usually is.  I tend to like things less salty, so theirs was more than how I like things.  That said, I think the overwhelming majority of people would be OK with the seasoning level here - it's not more than other restaurants in general."}
{"text":"Yummy & reasonably priced...could anyone ask for better? While there is nothing too \"special\" about the menu choices per say (it's typical Middle Eater cuisine) I must say that virtually everything on the menu tastes A-M-A-Z-N-G. I've gone to other Middle Easter restaurants (with the menu being nearly identical) & have been disappointed.

This was not the case with Sumac. The food was fresh (meat and veggies). However I will warn you, if you're not a \"saucy\" person...DO tell them to put minimal sauce (they tend to overdo it on the \"Sumac fries\").  It was a little crowded when I went so if you want a choice of seating, make sure to go at an \"off\" hour. Early supper at 3pm? Late lunch? Bring it!"}
{"text":"The food is very plain. I wouldn't even pay the price of fast food for it. I was fortunate to taste good Arabic food in different Arabic countries and this pales in comparison.

The Shawerma meat was bland. It was drowned in Hummus.

The Falafel sandwich was lackluster and I've tasted better in fast food joints like Crazy Falafel.

The fries and Hummus were plain.

Service was good. Decor was nice.

What it comes down to is overpriced below average food. If you want good but pricey Arabic dishes, I would suggest Damas on Parc."}
{"text":"The food is very good, If my review was based on that I would be giving 4 stars

The service however is lacking. I came here with coworkers and we waited a tremendous amount of time for our meal(around 40 minutes). What made this worse is that we were asked to pay (and tip) before we had done any waiting. This forced us to wait for our meal, which I definitely enjoyed less than if it had arrive within a reasonable amount of time.

I don't think I will be coming back here, unless I develop dementia."}
{"text":"Un de mes restos préférés pour le take-out, même si on peut manger sur place. Tables communales où familles et couples et groupes d'amis se mêlent dans l'harmonie. La bouffe est généreuse, goûteuse et tout simplement délicieuse. Probablement le meilleur sandwich de Montréal, le Sabich! La trempette Muhamara, les pitas maison qui n'ont rien à voir avec ce que l'on achète en épicerie, les frites maison, tout est délicieux!"}
{"text":"Some say Lebanese food should only be eaten out of a styrofoam container at 2am. To those people, I say go to Sumac. 

Sumac is the next level of Lebanese. The food tastes great and is clearly prepared fresh in their kitchen. I love the ambiance of Sumac and the fact that they have a full bar. 

The eating space consists of small tables and a long communal bench. The larger plate are meant to be shared between friends in a family style of eating. The room can get loud as the restaurant is super popular for dinner times but it's always such a warm and comfortable environment. I would come back for that eggplant salad any day. 

Food-wise I would say it tastes less greasy than some other fast-food places but I'm sure you can find the same quality Lebanese in other parts of the city. Definitely go for the experience though. It's a great place to eat."}
{"text":"My friends made me walk 20 minutes to this place when there were plenty of restaurants on the way- they said it was worth it and they were right!! Loved the setting-  middle-eastern food with great cocktails and nice music playing! Will definitely go back and recommend to friends"}
{"text":"Very flavourful and fresh middle eastern inspired food. The best falafel I ever had. Healthy dishes. Trendy hip hangout in St Henry. Can be loud and busy in the evening. Try the  Muhummara dip. Thinner pita bread would be best. Wish it would be opened on Saturday and Sunday for lunch! That's all you need to know."}
{"text":"I'm expert in middle eastern food but I love when grilled meat and salads deliver a good kick. I don't know how they do it but their spice mix is deep and satisfying. I would recommend that to anyone who finds Québec food too mild."}
{"text":"This is where I bring my out-of-towner friends to eat. The food is legit and surprisingly cheap given how dope clean this place is. Everyone has said everything there is to say about this restaurant. The humus fries got me my lost likes on Instagram. That's how good it is.

Take everything else (chicken, salads and lots of pitas).

Dope. Dope. Dope."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Best muhamarra in Montreal. Large portions and very cool modern vibe. The restaurant fills up very quickly so be prepared to wait. I had chicken shwarma and my friend had the falafel plate...both were delish. The brownie was outstanding."}
{"text":"Great food with fresh and quality ingredients! I prefer take-out to eating in because it's loud and crowded, and the line to order is so long. So much easier to call ahead! My favourites are the chicken or falafel in the pita, the sumac fries, all the plates (but beef is my least favourite and chicken is the best value), and most of the salads. A great addition to the neighbourhood, and a healthy and yummy option if you don't want to cook. Also great for group take out- just share, it's more fun. :)"}
{"text":"I came here with my vegetarian friend and I decided to go meatless that night. I didn't feel I was missing out on anything. We split a couple of dishes and they were all very good. The falafels are yummy and their eggplant plant dish with an egg on top is delicious."}
{"text":"The ambiance and the restaurant was great! Simple as it gets in terms of decorations, yet that is what I like. The food in general was delicious, unlike many other restaurants who have a heavy hand on the salt, Sumac was perfect on the salt. At last a restaurant that doesn't rely on only salt for flavor. 
Our meal arrived to our table in a matter of 10-15 mins, while the restaurant  was packed. So I was impressed with that.  While our meal was very tasty, it lacked warmth. It wasn't cold, but borderline of being cold. Nothing was too warm. Disappointing!!
My biggest disappointments: The method of ordering your food and the dessert. When you walk into the restaurant you first have to wait for a table, then order at the counter. There was one person with one cash taking all the orders. Because they only have one cash available. When you have a full house of 40+ people, you need more staff than just one person taking all the orders. So we waited 20-25 mins for our table, plus another 10 minutes to place our order. Very disappointing!! 

Our dessert was the Nutella brownie, with a cinnamon whipped cream not at all a Lebanese dessert yet, I was curious to try it. My question is.. Where was the Nutella? I honestly didn't taste one bit of of it! Luckily the whip cream was not out of can or spray, at last a restaurant that uses the real thing! Yet, it lacked taste. Bottom line,  Sumac opened very recently and it needs time to make some improvements. My biggest suggestion to them,  serve the food warm and not dry and semi-warm. 
The best thing: Their Hummus, Felafel and, all their salads. They were superb!!!"}
{"text":"So my initial review of Sumac was 4 shiny stars due to the excellent tasty food. Since this early experience I've visited this restaurant a number of times when they have been busy and as a result of my experiences I must update my review.

The food at Sumac continues to be terrific,  what is far less than terrific is the system the restaurant has in place for order taking and seating and the owners attitude. When you arrive at Sumac at a busy time they do not allow you to secure a seat before ordering. Therefor you are stuck waiting in the line to order with no idea if a seat will be available for you by the time you get to the front of the line. You also have not idea if the people in front of you in the line are there for a table or for takeout.  So the result is that you may end up waiting in line only to find out that there is no space for you to sit and there are a bunch of people standing around waiting for tables to open up. 

On a number of occasions I have seen or experienced the owner treating clients with an impatient and rough manner which is a real turnoff to me. 

I hope that Sumac figures out how to resolve these issues and provide great customer services so I can go back to enjoying their delicious food."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend on a whim and we were 100% pleased with Sumac.

The restaurant itself has a cool and modern vibe to it with maybe enough seating for 30-35 people. It's a middle eastern restaurant without being too ethnic which was very refreshing (although ethic places are amazing but we both found the twist in this restaurant really nice). I ordered the kafta plate with the quinoa and red cabbage salad while my friend had the eggplant plate with the quinoa and mixed salad. We also ordered a pitcher of the whiskey half and half cocktail and sumac fries to share. Our meals were out in under ten minutes and wow was every single thing absolutely delicious! Explosions of flavor erupted after bites of every single item and the cocktail was absolutely perfect. The food was beautifully plated and portions were very decent if not on the larger side.

The restaurant was extremely packed (it was a Tuesday..) the entire 2 hours we were there and we couldn't find a single bad thing to say. It's slightly on the more expensive side of things but ever so slightly. For the quality and service, the price is fine! Delicious delicious delicious. Will absolutely be back!"}
{"text":"Great food, different than the normal fare at a middle eastern restaurant, all food is high quality, I normally never eat French fries, but the sumac fries were awesome, home cut potatoes cooked to perfection and drizzled with sumac seasoning. Defiantly worth trying. Various salads were fresh and lively. I tried the homemade drinks they offered and the lemonade was to die for."}
{"text":"Holy falafel! 
I wandered into Sumac during lunch hour as the restaurant was only a quick walk from my office and I was craving Middle Eastern - specifically a falafel filled pita. 

The first impression of the restaurant was a good one. The decor and ambiance is open, airy and welcoming and employees are incredibly friendly. I can't say much for a dining experience as my order was for take-out but Sumac is on our list of places to dine at in the near future. 

It was easy to tell that they were undergoing a lunch rush but all orders were handled courteously and with a smile. I ordered the falafel pita (if you couldn't tell already) which came up to about $9.00 and a reasonable wait time for the time of day. Now $9.00 is reasonable for lunch but still more than what a falafel pita would cost at your nearest Boustan's or Amir - but after the first bite you'll find out why. Sumac JAM PACKS the pita full of falafel. I was actually taken a back at how much they managed to pack into one pita. And they were able to season and flavour the ingredients to my taste buds' satisfaction. 

I've been raving about this experience for some time now and can't wait to return for a full dining experience."}
{"text":"My first visit in October 2014 I wrote a review which it seems appeared to be an automaton to Yelp so didn't get seen:
Really enjoyed my first visit to Sumac. As a veg it's not always easy to share a meal with an omnivore and both be totally satisfied. Fortunately he also went the falafel route. I had the pita, he had the plate. Both filled with colorful veggies.The food was delicious...fresh and tasty. The fries-Sumac fries- were divine!!!The staff was friendly and attentive...and this was the second day open. Our meal was a treat! The ordering/serving method might get a bit confusing when they get really busy. We were there with very few people-not sure what the noise level would be like with many talking heads.The website did not show wine on the menu but it is offered. If my next visit is as good...I'll go to 5 stars.
I've been back in February. Glad to see it really busy....And the food is still delicious and fresh and the staff is still warm and courteous! I had the same falafel pita and asked for no dairy which was not a problem. My friend had the chicken plate. We shared the amazing Sumac fries. Fantastic. May Sumac enjoy a long and successful run!"}
{"text":"Vous cherchez un super restaurant pour un lunch dans Saint-Henry?! Sumac ne vous décevra pas! 
Ce restautant propose differents types de plats origines libanaises principalement des pitas avec des viandes grillés ou des falafels (qui sont à tomber par terre), de fraîches salades et des hummus aux légumes variés. Les pitas sont fabuleusement garnies avec des légumes et des sauces goûteuses. Accompagnée de delicieuses frites, voilà un dîner gagnant!
Leur thé glacé maison est TRÈS bon! Le service est rapide ce qui est idéal pour les travailleur pressé du quartier mais personne ne vous force non plus à la sortie ce qui est aussi bien pour ceux qui souhaitent plus prendre leur temps."}
{"text":"This was one of my favourite food experiences in Montreal. I will admit that I do love Lebanese food, but there were also flavours from Morocco which made a perfect pairing. I ordered the plate with two salads (eggplant and a fresh salad). It also came with hummus which was so tasty, fluffy and smooth it was addictive and pita. The pita were whole wheat and home made which was a real treat. Apart from a bit of confusion about ordering and paying before we sat down we had a lovely meal. The space is beautiful, the servers were all friendly, and the kitchen staff are making magic."}
{"text":"Coming here is always a good time! It's a great neighbourhood eatery and really for everyone! The atmosphere is ~trendy~ but relaxed and the food is pretty good. 

To do it right, order a bunch of plates to share and block off a solid amount of time to talk and eat at a leisurely place, proper Middle Eastern style. Definitely order the labne/ feta hybrid (criminally good) and the shwarma and make sure to balance out the heavier dishes with some refreshing salads. Finish off with the brownie (trust me this is no time to skip dessert).  I haven't tried any of their drinks yet but their cocktail menu looks tasty and seems ever-changing!

Tip: Yes, there's usually a line but that's only testament to the fact that you're in the right place at the right time! That said, you can avoid it by ordering takeout ;)"}
{"text":"AMAZING. If I could eat here every day, I would. 
Portions are huge and price is reasonable.
Very casual ambiance and friendly staff."}
{"text":"I remember going to Satay Brothers one night and while we were walking there, we came across an AMAZING aroma in the air and were like, \"what is THAT?\" Turns out it wasn't Satay Brothers but rather SUMAC, just down the street. Already committed to going to Satay Brothers (ended up not being all that) but made a note to check out that SUMAC spot next time.

Finally went there the other night. Pretty crackin spot with a nice setup and chill ambience. The also had some 90s hip hop bumpin. Never imagined I'd be eating a pita to Kurupt's infamous first verse on \"Xxxplosive (dirty version)\" but alas, there I was. 

I had the Kefta plate, which was delish. My partner liked her Chicken Shawerma plate. We also shared the hummus fries, which were good but overwhelming. 

Overall I'd give it a solid 3 stars."}
{"text":"The line was a bit long, and it took a long time to get our order out.
We had the chicken shawarma and falafel, the chicken shawarma was not my my liking, I prefer my shawarma to be more tinder juicy. The falafel was ok, I had better."}
{"text":"Best falafel I have ever tried so far in MTL. We got falafel and kefta plates that comes with two salads of your choice. Both of them had all fresh ingredients. Staff is friendly and place itself is hipsterish. Recommend!"}
{"text":"Bon service, rapide. Leurs plats me rappelent un peur Ottolenghi. J'ai vraiment craqué pour leur Sabich composé d'aubergine frite, d'oeuf cuit dur, de concombres mainés..."}
{"text":"Best restaurant in the neighbourhood by a county mile. No--a county hectare.

Who are we kidding. The best restaurant in Montreal."}
{"text":"Love this place! 

Before Sumac, whenever I craved Lebanese food, I would either make it myself or turn to Boustan. While Boustan is still very much a favorite of mine, Sumac takes Montreal Lebanese food to a whole new level. 

They use super fresh ingredients, the dishes are perfect every time, and the portion sizes are huge. Of course, not as cheap as your Boustan or Amir, but considering the quality and the amount of food, the prices are still fantastic.

Try everything on the menu! Highly recommend the hummus fries, the chicken schawarma, the fried eggplant salad, garlic labneh... to name a few!

There's always a lineup here, so if you live in the area, try to call ahead for take out. Dining in is also a great experience -- fantastic ambiance."}
{"text":"AMAZING!!
A good friend of mine recommended this place and I never tried tunisien food before and boy I wasn't disappointed. Portions are huge and worth the price. I would definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Really great Lebanese food in a funky and up and coming neighbourhood.  Everything is super fresh with top quality ingredients.  My only complaint is that they are a little heavy handed with the salt at times.  Portions are generous, if I get the platter with two salads, I usually have enough for lunch the next day!  All the salads are good, my personal favourite is the carrot.  The pita bread and hummus is the best.

This spot is always busy, so if you don't want to wait for a table, order takeout or come early.  They are usually pretty efficient, and it's a fun, lively spot, so if you're in for a wait, grab a drink, relax and enjoy the atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Food was good but I don't think I'll ever return. The concept makes absolutely no sense: you order before getting a table and they don't let you get one until your entire group shows up. My friend and I got there a bit early and tried to order fries and they wouldn't let us? The 2 female staff also gave us some attitude about it too. Those hummus fries are good, but not enough to convince me to put myself through that pain again."}
{"text":"This place definitely does not need another glowing review, but here it is anyway. 

Sumac is Montréal at its best; casual, super tasty food and cool vibes. Picture communal tables and an amazing wine and cocktail list. Great for pretty much any occasion.

P.S. The harira soup is to-die-for."}
{"text":"Excellent middle eastern cuisine, great humous, fries, falafel. Loads of veggie options. Excellent service. Gets busy in the evenings but the wait is worth it."}
{"text":"Probably my favourite comfort food. Really happy to have this as a go to Lebanese food staple. Was recommended to me by a close friend and I wasn't disappointed. Went with my family and all of us loved it. It's a casual resto where you can get take out or sit down, community style. The portions are generous, enough so that we brought a lot home to have the next day, and it was just as good. 
Loved everything I ate and am definitely going back. 
If you love Lebanese food this is an absolute must!"}
{"text":"The food and drinks were great. We started off with Chicken Shawarma plate for myself and Sabich plate for my wife and got couple in-house drinks - pomegranate for my wife and citrus for myself. Both drinks were delicious. The quantity of the plate is filling - it comes along with 2 salads of choice. My chicken strip seemed a bit dry. I made pockets of the pita and filled it up with the salads, hummus and chicken and it tasted delicious.

Will recommend this place for Mediterranean food."}
{"text":"After seeing the delicious food photos on Yelp, I had to try this place, and I'm so glad I did! 

The place is chill, open brick walls, music in the background with loud crowds. It's a casual place where you order at the cashier, take a number for the table, and they bring the food to you. The workers don't check up on you after serving the food so just go up to the cashier or call them up. They were very friendly people.

We ordered one of each of the family style meals and the portions were enough to fill all 6 of us up for around $20 per person, before taxes and tips, which is a good deal especially for the quality of the food we were served.

So for the family meals, they have falafels, shawarma (chicken), kefta, sabich and salads. On the side we also ordered tahini hummus and pita bread. 
They brought out the bread and hummus first, for appetizer. Hummus with olive oil was amazing, super smooth and flavourful. Pita bread was good too, the bread itself didn't stand out but I liked the spices they put on top. Turns out the pita bread is the only thing not homemade here, but EVERYTHING else is, which is very impressive.
For salads, we ordered beets, red cabbage, spicy carrots, quinoa, and cauliflower with fennel. They were all great, I especially liked the spicy carrots.
The falafel was crunchy on the outside and had a lot of flavour. 
The shawarma was the most tender shawarma I've had in Montreal, and among my top 5 for best chicken dish. 
The kefta reminded me of Japanese hamburg steak, it was good but not memorable compared to other dishes.
The ultimate, best dish here, at least for me, was the sabich, which is fried eggplant topped with boiled eggs and pickled cucumber drenched in amba sauce. It's heavy but so, SO good that I could eat this until I drop dead. I would've licked the plate if the waitress didn't take away the plate. 

Overall a great experience for me, I'll be coming back for sure!"}
{"text":"I am not from Montreal and do not speak French but had a great experience at Sumac
-was a little confusing at first but if you intend to eat in (recommended), you tell one of the staff members you are eating in and they will you a number sign. Then when you order at the register you have to repeat that number and then you find a seat with your number sign up
-for Americans, think of Sumac as a fast casual restaurant (there are waiters but they are not taking your order; I do not believe you have to tip at the table although there is a tip jar at the counter)
-came in for lunch on a weekday and place was packed
-got the chicken Shawarma plate for $16 CAD. you get pita, hummus, pickled turnip, tahini and choice of 2 salads (went with cucumber and quinoa)
-food was light and fresh but delicious and flavorful at the same time. Was not heavy at all. Fresh 
-ask for hot sauce
-restaurant is very bright and clean. Great place to chat as well
-waiters come by with water frequently. Good service
-would definitely come back. Less than a 10 minute walk from metro station
-note they are closed on Sunday and Monday

Overall a great eating experience"}
{"text":"This place has awesome decor.

We had the chicken and beef shawarma each and both of our plates are delicious. I chose the fenouil&cauliflower salad and the \" Chou vert \" salad as my friend chose the quinoa salad and the cucumber salad. All the ingredients are fresh and well seasoned and we didn't have bad aftertaste.

Service is friendly overall but they try to rush you to order and finish the plates to speed up the turnover. If you sit in the table in the middle you will need to share with other people."}
{"text":"Quand on a envie d'une bonne bouffe santé et savoureuse, c'est le Sumac qu'il nous faut. Jamais déçus jusqu'à maintenant, l'un des meilleurs take out en ville."}
{"text":"Trendy spot and good food!

Went on a weekend night and it was packed. Their ordering system and placement was rather awkward. Once you walk in, they ask you to wait at the counter. We had one party who ordered before us, but we had to wait until a table frees up before we can order. Ended up standing for a while beside dinner guests and trying not to block the path where the food comes out. :/

The food is fairly priced and I recommend the platters for sharing! It comes with hummus, pits bread, your choice of protein, and two salads. The variety of salads were all delicious and flavourful. Got the chicken and falafel ones and they didn't disappoint either.
Also recommend the sumac fries!"}
{"text":"Highly recommend this NEW Montreal restaurant! I went with other 3 foodies and no one had anything but raves and compliments for this fresh, tasty, innovative restaurant! 

Definitely worth going and try the l'abneh appetizer. We shared (family style) a falafel plate, a chicken plate, 5 salads, french fries and we were pleasantly stuffed to the gills when we left.

Congrats to the owner and team. Well done!!"}
{"text":"Tried the chicken schwarma platter.  Chicken was pretty good, liked the pita, eggplant and hummus was really good.  Very clean nice place to eat.  Service was great.  Fries were good."}
{"text":"J'en avais entendu parlé par pas mal de personne et toujours en bien. J'avais donc hâte de venir.
L'intérieur est très posé je trouve au niveau mobilier, nous sommes venus un vendredi midi et c'était remplis. Malgré cela on n'a pas attendu pour un table, on a peut être eu de la chance :)
J'ai pris une pita au poulet avec un thé glacé et on s'est partagé une frite à 2. Le pain à pita est magique, tendre, frais et qui ne se casse pas pendant que l'on mange. Le contenu de la pita était remarquable. Les épices très bien dosés, la sauce et les légumes nickel. J'ai tout simplement adoré ce plat. La petite sauce piquante que l'on peut demandé réhausse un peu le gout et donne une autre dimension au plat. vraiment sublime l'ensemble.
Les frites sont excellente, un peu assaisonné avec des épices qui leur donnent un goût unique. Cela va parfaitement avec la pita en accompagnement.
Que dire du thé glacé, il était juste excellent. Un super goût de thé qui se boit sans soif et très désaltérant.
Vous comprenez donc facilement que j'ai adoré ce restaurant et j'ai déjà hâte d'y retourner !"}
{"text":"We came here for the hummus fries, but we decided to go big or go home soo... We also got a platter of keftedes, with carrot and eggplant salads, andddd the muhamara. 
1. It was all delicious. Hummus fries lived up to expectation, and the fries were really nice and crispy. The muhamara was extremely tasty too.
2. This was WAY too much food for a meal for two people. The hummus fries alone were huge and would have been more than enough to split.

We were eating well for days!!"}
{"text":"We ordered the chicken shawarma with a side of eggplant salad quinoa salad and  sumac fries plus the house iced tea.
The salads were spectacular. The quinoa one had what seemed like walnut pieces as well as zereshk berries, green onions and parsley. It was really nice.

The eggplant salad is a eggplant mash.its tasty and offers a nice blend of flavors from a good use of exotic spices.. It is a bit on the heavy side but well worth it

The chicken was a bit less stellar as it was very stringy and tough. The flavour was a bit too ripe it seemed like really lesser  cuts and maybe reheated. Not bad but not as nice as it could be.

The sumac fries were quite a fun dish. They were piping hit and crispy and absolutely covered in tart ground sumac. Lovely!

The down note goes to the house iced tea. It tasted like powdered commercial mix, grainy and overly sweet. We could not drink it really it did not match meal at all. 

We stated this at the cash when asked but they still xharged us for it. So we wondered why ask then!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant, food makes you feel like you're sitting at a restaurant in Jaffa overlooking the Mediterranean. Pita is fantastic and the hummus tehina combo is the best outside of Jerusalem. Portions are great as individual portions or family size."}
{"text":"Super delicious. I got the sabich plate (new to me, but I love roasted eggplant, so I figured it'd be a good choice) with spiced carrot and fattoush salads. I'm omnivorous but was in the mood for vegetables, and was impressed with the combination of fresh flavors (mint, fennel, herbs) and rich ones (fried eggplant, tahini sauce). So yummy that I wanted to write a review to encourage other people to try the same dish!"}
{"text":"Tranquille ce soir, sûrement à cause de la dame qui ce refait une beauté! La bouffe excellente et toujours du staff très accueillants et souriants! Bonne appétit!!!"}
{"text":"Sumac is one of the newer Middle Eastern restaurants in town. Completely different than La Petit Alep. Yes, I went to both in the same day. No, it wasn't intentional.

Located in the up and coming St. Henri neighbourhood, I did a little walk around the 'hood while I waited for Cbear to get off work. Holy crap, this area is trendy.

The inside is bumping. I shouldn't even be surprised but for a Tuesday evening, it was insane. Loud, bustling, it's definitely one the new \"it\" places. The line makes zero sense and trying to scrounge a table wasn't easy. There's one long communal table smack in the middle of things.

A variety of drinks to please everyone. Beers on tap along with cocktails and wine. The menu is plastered onto some wooden planks along one of the walls. Salads, hummus & baba, extras, pitas, plates and family style plates. Love the sharing aspect here.

- 2x Carlsberg ($8.00 each) - we each got a Carlsberg to go with our meals. The pints were ice cold and hit the spot.

- Falafel plate ($14.00) - served with grilled pita, hummus, tahini, pickled turnip and a choice of two salads. The charred pita was pillowy goodness with a sprinkling of za'atar spice over top. We opted for the quinoa (kale, almonds, barberries, golden raisins and green onion) and salade cuite (slow cooked tomatoes and roasted sweet peppers). Both were absolutely delicious! Think they stole the spotlight from the falafels themselves, which were dry and unimpressive. I don't think we even finished the falafels. Yikes.

- Side of chicken shawarma ($6.00) - we were taking forever to decide what to get so the worker manning the till helped us out. We were originally going to get a plate of chicken shawarma ($16.00) but she told us that we would get the same amount of meat if we were to just do it as a side. Okay! Thanks for the sweet tip.

The chicken itself was tasty but some pieces felt like it had been sitting around for awhile. They must cook it beforehand or something.

- Sumac fries ($4.00) - the fries were great. Excellent spice from the sumac and za'atar. Portion size is huge.

We rolled out of Sumac stuffed. Lucky, we only ordered one full plate otherwise we would have had leftovers for days. Sumac is cool, hip and different from your typical Middle Easter/Lebanese joint."}
{"text":"Soooo good for a big meal at a cheap price. Have the pomegranate lemonade and the hummus, but also try to go during a weekday because otherwise its absolutely packed. We waited for about 20 minutes before being seated, but once we dug in it was great."}
{"text":"Great mix of traditional recipes and new twists. Beautifully set up dinning area with a lovely modern and organic vibe. The staff are friendly and knowledgable. The portions were much larger than expected, yet still full of flavour. Definitely a place that would be ideal for a date, family dinner or casual grab-and-go. And, a perfect fit in St. Henri."}
{"text":"Casual in between fast food joint and proper sit down restaurant that serves up a killer middle eastern fare. 

The concept is simple, you line up and order your meal at the cashier, she gives you a number sign, you grab a spot in their convivial dining area and you wait impatiently for your food to be brought to you by a waiter. 

Portions are huge and their dip game is to die for! Best mouhamarra I have tried in Montreal hands down! I also love how they serve generous portions of salads to go with their plates. However, their spicy carrot salad was not spicy at all... They can definitely kick it up a notch! 
Their chicken shawarma is a lot meatier than your average chicken shawarma found in fast food joints; the quality of the meat is another level. However, the reason why I love middle eastern food so much is for the garlic sauce they always serve with it... Which in this case was replaced by hummus. Don't get me wrong, the hummus was excellent but just didn't quite have that tangy kick to it that garlic aioli offers. We had to order the garlic labneh on the side to please my palate. 

Overall, great place for a casual night out. Quality price ratio is excellent and they also serve alcohol!"}
{"text":"holy muhamarra.

If you're planning on going to Sumac which I strongly recommend you do it's best to avoid tight fitting clothing and acquire someone who is willing to give you a belly rub after because the food is just so divine you won't be able to stop eating.

I got the muhamarra (a red pepper walnut dip) and a salad trio to share and it was plenty of food. Between the two of us there was still so much left over. All the salads we tried were incredible!

This restaurant is so veggie friendly but not in the way that makes your omnivore friends grumpy to be there since they have an incredible spread of options. Their homemade drinks were wonderful and if you can't decide between the two ask for a half & half; it's insane. 

My only problem with the restaurant was that it didn't have a very clear ordering system. You have to give your order and then you sit down and they serve you. Even as we were taking our order it wasn't a very clear interaction. Over all though; the food is just so fantastic you won't remember anything else!"}
{"text":"This is absolutely my favourite Middle Eastern restaurant now. I'm not talking just in Montréal, but overall never have I had better Middle Eastern food. 
First of, it's cheap. They get points immediately there. 
Second, the portion sizes are BIG. Their plates (which go for around $15) come with hummus, pita, and two small salads as sides. 
Third, the side dishes are delicious! 
Fourth, the main dishes are delicious! So far I have tried the chicken shawarma, beef kefta , and the falafel. All absolutely sublime. Their food is flavourful, and juicy. None of that dry stuff here. 
And last, fifth (for the fifth star), the ambiance is great. It is clean, it is nicely laid out, and the staff is very nice and accommodating. And top it all off, their washroom isn't a dump - it's actually cute. 

This has become my definitive \"must go to\" spot every time I am in Montréal. Hope it gets the credit it deserves... But judging by the other reviews on here, I'm not too worried."}
{"text":"Have to say this was a delicious combination of food!
The warm vegetable was awesome with the shawarma... Glad to have these guys in my hood, bienvenu"}
{"text":"Sumac is a new Lebanese restaurant located on Notre-Dame Street that offers good food and good service in a minimalist and clean setting. My husband and I were drawn in one evening; we had passed in front of the place several times and we were curious to see if they were any good. 

We had two falafel pitas and one small baba ganouj, all very tasty, fresh and filling. The pitas were especially big and warm. The waiting was longer than expected - although the entrée came fast, it took 20 minutes for the pitas to be served - we decided it was well worth the wait.

The prices at Sumac are higher than at most other Lebanese chains around the city, however the quality of the food is clearly superior. When I brought that first eggplant dish to my mouth and tasted it, I knew for sure that whoever had prepared it actually cared. Their food is good and they know it! 

Overall Sumac is a good restaurant and I definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"One of the best middle eastern food in Montreal. The design of the restaurant is very trendy/modern. The portion are huge so it is great to share."}
{"text":"great food and casual atmosphere. Love the shwarma!! Water bottles a nice touch"}
{"text":"Maybe I need to learn how to order, because when I looked at my dish(es) it looked more like a deconstructed burger! Which is not a bad thing, the meat was cooked pretty nicely, but I'm just not crazy over Sumac?"}
{"text":"I live in the usa and sumac is about a 5 hour drive from my house. I would go to canada just to eat at sumac. I am middle eastern and this is how middle eastern food should be. Im super picky and this is about the only middle eastern restaurant I would eat at outside of my house.  The manager is very friendly along with the rest of the staff. The restaurant is clean and the food is just amazing!"}
{"text":"I found this place through Yelp! It wasn't too packed, so we got seated right away. I found the menu on the wall a bit hard to read/decipher. A printed menu that we can grab would have been helpful. We ordered our food and it was served to us in less than 5 minutes! The salads are absoultely delicious and the shawarma chicken was very tasty and not too dry. The place is very clean and the staff is friendly. I would definately recommend this place for people to try. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Les meilleurs falafels en ville!!!! Tout est bon et frais sur le menu! Parfait pour un repas semi rapide...j'éviterais cette place pour un date parce que c'est un peu bruillant!"}
{"text":"Sumac is great new a casual new spot on the ever growing restaurant strip in St-Henri. I tried it with a few friends last week and although had heard that it was a good bet for Middle Eastern food, I didn't expect it to be as yummy as it was.

There are tons of things to choose from on the menu (especially if you're a vegetarian) and everything we tasted was delicious from the felafel to the garlicky feta appetizer and babaghanoush. They also serve beers, cocktails and wine by the glass. In fact, they have a small but excellent wine selection that includes my favorite Nebbiolo that's hard to find anywhere in the city.

The environment is quite casual (you order from the counter on your way in before being seated) but there's a good vibe and the atmosphere is pleasant. What's more, the service is friendly and on the ball and the prices are totally reasonable. Get ready to pay more for your food than a place like Basha, but the quality of ingredients, choice of dishes, and presentation (and restaurant atmosphere) are leaps and bounds above your typical Middle Eastern fast food.

This is a great bet if you are looking for something yummy in St-Henri and are up for a casual experience."}
{"text":"There's nothing wrong with Sumac, really, but I can't bring myself to give them four stars and here's why:
1) lacks originality: As evidenced by their display of all of Ottolenghi's cookbooks, they are basically serving you someone else's recipes with nothing more, nothing less. It's a bit of a rip off, and as much as I enjoy zhoug (or \"s'rug\")... I have some in my fridge that I also made from \"Jerusalem\". The hummus was fine, but rather plain. Inspiration is one thing... But this... I don't know guys.
2) bland: The portions are substantial, but I would not go so far as to call them copious, and I didn't finish my salads because they were seriously lacking flavour. I'm not saying I left hungry... But I wasn't stressing about getting my leftovers to go... cause they were just ok:
3) overpriced: $20 got me a plate of food and a drink - the exact same thing I would have gotten from Boustan or Amor for half that price. Yes, Sumac is pretty-ish and clean... But the differences pretty much end there. You're gonna have to do a lot more than line some cookbooks on the shelves to get me to pay double for something that was not much better than (and in the case of the bland salads, actually not even up to par with) your discount competition.

The service was lovely, but I was a bit surprised that when I paid by card I was proposed to tip 15-20-25%. Having worked as an actual waitress who had her wages garnished by the government based on food sales... Just.... No. You're entitled to your tip jar, fine, but those of us who actually bust out butts for less than minimum wage and are forced to give up to half our tips to the taxman are gonna be pretty miffed to see you proposing a 20% or 25% option on your debit machine. Preposterous."}
{"text":"Vraiment bon!! Des plats pleins de saveurs et originaux. J'adore le pain et le hummus servis avec nos plats et le cocktail crush est excellent! À revenir manger à mon retour à Montréal! Très original comme restaurant en plus d'être rapide comme service."}
{"text":"We discovered Sumac recently and I have to say that the salads are really fantastic. We tried them alongside a chicken shawarma and sabbich plate. My favorite salad was the \"salad cuite\". The carrot, beet and fennel salads were also very tasty. The sabbich was very good, but since I am not a huge fan of eggplants, I was grateful that I was sharing the dish with other people. Their harira soup is very thick and served in a mug; perfect for a cold winter night!  Everything at Sumac ss packed with flavors! Overall, I did find it a little too salty and it is the main reason I may not be going as frequently as I would want to. Then again, I find a lot of restaurant food salty, so you might think the flavor is just right.  Price-wise, it's great value for the quality of food you are getting."}
{"text":"Food is quite good.
You order at the counter then grab then take your seat, which I also enjoy.

Pricier than other Lebanese places but the food is that much better therefore good value for your money."}
{"text":"Chill little place in St-Henri to go on a casual weeknight. Food is good but nothing out of the ordinary. The mhammarah deserves a thumbs up! Portions are generous and price is very appropriate. Try it out if you're in the neighbourhood craving middle eastern food."}
{"text":"Busy on Saturday night, but we arrived early and got a table. Delicious, we mixed chicken and vegi dishes. Spicy carrots, yummy, eggplant, yummy..... Pitcher of beer. Very nice staff. Order at the counter and the staff bring the dishes to your table. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Affordable and tasty. Both things that make this place one of my favourite little restaurants in St-Henri. Staff is super friendly, the service is superb & the food never disappoints. Plus: the decor and presentation of the food is super cute."}
{"text":"Outside of a few specific food items, I considered myself pretty adventurous food wise. While my parents did expose me to many different things outside of our French-Canadian customs, it wasn't until I moved downtown for school did I learn to enjoy some more \"obscure\" (at least from my perspective) food cultures. All of this came to mind when I heard about a new restaurant in St-Henri serving up great Middle Eastern cuisine. This type of cuisine is still a huge blind spot in my food knowledge so I was very hopeful that Sumac could show me the way.

Located on the main strip of Notre Dame just west of the Atwater Market, Sumac has a very clean and sharp look. They beautifully utilize the brick wall of the old building and compliment it with pure white walls, light hardwood floors and solid wood tables. The ample lighting create a very bright space that creates a warm feel. They have a slight different ordering procedure where you order at the counter and then serve you at your table using number cards. The issue, in the two times I have been, was that because the menu is only on the wall right by the cash, people take a little too long to order as they figure what to order. As such, the lineup at the counter gets long and takes longer than it probably should. The line spills into the seating space which isn't great either for the patrons seating down. Also, there isn't really a good spot for takeout people to wait either. Note that I went on two Friday nights so probably the peak period for this problem. I imagine it is much better the rest of the time - not a big deal, simply a minor observation.

The menu is one befitting a falafel shop - falafels, chicken shawarma, beef kefta with a assortment of salads, grains, fries, hummus and baba. On my first visit, I decided to start with the hummus fries with hummus, tahini and s'rug. This dish was one of the first things I saw online from Sumac and peaked my interest tremendously. Just wonderful all around - the fries were nicely crispy on the outside and fluffy inside. The combination of the creamy tahini, the spice of the s'rug and the rich hummus worked exceptionally well - I had no knowledge of s'rug prior to this and my limited time with tahini never made me think of this combination. Great starter and a huge portion as well. A must-have for sure!

Given the size of the fries, I decided to go with a chicken shawarma pita to finish off the meal. When you order a pita at Sumac, it is grilled and filled with hummus, tahina, chopped salad, white &amp; purple cabbage and pickled turnip on top of your meal of choice. First off, the pita bread at Sumac is insanely good. Borderland obscene. Wherever they get them, I need to find out because they have put every other pita bread I've tried to shame. Thick but yet soft and chewy, the pita bread provided a great vessel for the rest of the ingredients. The chicken was nice and juicy and the vegetables fresh and crisp. An excellent pita all around.

I was so enthused by my first visit that I decided to return two weeks later for a quick takeout. In this instance, I broke my own rule and didn't order the fries in order to try some more of the menu. First, I went with the garlic labneh served with bulgarian feta, dukkah, paprika oil, mint and a side of grilled pita bread. A wonderful appetizer that needed a lot more bread than I got! I loved how the labneh and feta mixed together - combining the saltiness and firmer texture of the feta with the yogourt-like creaminess and sour taste of the labneh. The nutty mixture of the dukkah with the fresh mint and spicy paprika oil helped to ease up the heavy richness of the dish. Very nice all around and made for a great snack using the leftovers.

My main course this second time was the falafel plat served with pita, hummus, tahini, pickled turnip and my choice of two salads. I went with the fried eggplant (with harissa, preserved lemon and coriander) and the Moroccan carrots with currants, cumin and parsley. Enjoyed the carrots although they weren't as spicy as I expected. As for the eggplant, it was okay - something didn't grab me and frankly I'm not sure what. As for the falafels themselves, loved them. Great crunch to the exterior but they still kept a nice moistness inside. Nice depth of flavour as well.

Sumac provided me with a wonderful trip into Middle Eastern cuisine which was my hope. My initial visit got me interested enough to head back to try more and my second visit did more of the same. I may lack knowledge in this cuisine but I know enough about great cuisine to know that Sumac does it very well. Some of you may be scared away simply by the type of cuisine but believe me, you would be doing yourselves a grave disservice to ignore the wonderful food coming out of this little shop in St-Henri. You should have time on your side if you change your mind - I suspect Sumac will be a staple in the neighbourhood for some time.

Cheers!"}
{"text":"Loved this restaurant. The food is middle eastern with a trendy twist. The atmosphere is trendy and hip. Service was good. I've been to this restaurant twice and both times had a good time"}
{"text":"J'y suis allée un soir après de le travail avec un ami. J'ai trouvé l'espace vraiment beau et original. J'aime l'idée de partage une grande table avec d'autres clients et de voir la cuisine tout au fond. Les plafonds super haut for. En sorte que ça devient assez cacophonique quand c'est plein. Plus un genre casse croûte chic. Le principe d'aller commander au comptoir rend la chose moins agréable pour moi; juste ça fait que le  Resto est dans une catégorie plus fast food. Une fois la commande passée on nous sert à notre table. Le service était très bien. Nous avons eu aussi des conseils pour le vin. Ils n'ont que quelques bouteilles de rouge et de blanc mais somme toute ils ont des choix intéressant. Ils font aussi des cocktails. La bouffe était correcte. Le muhammara était bien fait. Le pain ptits servi chaud est très bon. Le kefta de buf était plutôt sec et servi sans sauce. Le poulet shish taouk était goûteux. Les salades aussi étaient très bonnes. Au final c'est un bon petit Resto pour manger rapidement un soir de semaine."}
{"text":"There is a jug of water waiting for you on the table! 
We were 3 people and ordered 3 plates to share. The chicken shawarma was my favorite. It comes with side salads. The hummus is home made and out of this world! 
The place has a cool vibe. 
It covers a niche market between upscale Mediterranean and fast food. 
You order off a menu posted on the wall. They don't take reservations. The kitchen closes at 10:00. 
Good service. 
The food is just really great! I am definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Tried this restaurant but would not go back. The food was less than average, and definitely not worth the price. I get better middle Eastern food at the fast food chains than that restaurant. It's inevitable to wait for more than half an hour as you can't make a reservation. The ambiance is loud, not in a good way, and the music (hip-hop) really not suiting the place. Tried the kafta, the meat was chewy and dry. The mouhammara (red pepper paste with walnuts) was good, the baba ghannouj (eggplant side dish) was average, and salads less than average. The owner was there and was very rude."}
