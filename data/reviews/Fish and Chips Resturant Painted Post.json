{"text":"I've been here a million times (I live in the area). And it's worth every visit. It's in a small plaza with a Royal Bank and a beauty salon. Owned by a very cute Korean couple, who you can tell, while waiting around for your food, that they put time and care into preparing your meal!!  I always order the lunch special (even when it's not lunch, I've gone there so much they let it pass) and its roughly $12. Included is a Greek salad, pop and a box jam packed with fresh French fries, two gigantic fish pieces and they always top everything off with a fried onion ring.   Pros:  - Delicious food, made to order - Friendly owners - They remember loyal customers  - Gigantic portions - A lot better than a few other fish and chip places I've been too in Scarborough.   Cons: - Kind of greasy (but what do you expect when everything is deep fried?) - A little pricey at times when there is no special.   I've had my share of fish and chip places, and this is still the best one hands down."}
{"text":"Painted Post Fish & Chips date visited : February 26, 2018 Update : I would rate this as a $ resto and not a $$.  This place is the lowest price place for F&C that my wife and I have dined at in Scarborough.  This was our first time at Painted Post Fish & Chips after how many years of just passing by.  Wife and I were the mood for fish and chips, and since it was a Monday, St. Andrews Fish and Chips happen to be closed.  So luckily enough we decided to stop in to Painted Post.  The decor is rather spartan, but don't let that dissuade you from trying the fish and chips at this Scarborough gem.  Service : 3/5 at the time of our visit only 2 people on staff.  Language could be a slight barrier, I found the lady behind the counter a little difficult to comprehend.  Food : 4/5 Now to the food.  We ordered the 3 person Haddock Family pack, which includes : 6 pieces of Haddock, a double order of chips and either coleslaw or beef gravy for $21.49 before taxes, along with a greek salad.  Now since I manage gout, had to skip out on the beef gravy and opted for the cole slaw, which my wife was interested in.  Myself can't touch the coleslaw either due to the cabbage & gout. Dropped 1 point due to non-creamy coleslaw and only having tartar sauce packets.  - Coleslaw : you may wish to skip this or inquire about substitution for maybe more chips, it wasn't the creamy variety and apparently to my wife's palate little heavy on the white vinegar.  She only finished half of it..she left the other half behind.  She prefers her coleslaw on the creamier side.  - Haddock (6) pieces : these were awesome for both of us!  The batter wasn't too heavy at all, and not greasy (which we usually prefer the less greasy when it comes to fish n chips and anything else fried).  Glad we ordered the 3 person family pack, it was just enough chips for us and we had 2 pieces of haddock left over for take home, which was my lunch the following day :)  - Chips : 2 orders worth, and cut more on the chunkier side, and not frozen  - Greek Salad : we thoroghly enjoyed the greek salad, really generous on the feta cheese and for $2.95 (pre-tax) it was nicely portioned  Now they also have other dishes available other than Fish n Chips.  They also have burgers, pork and chicken souvlaki, scallop n chips, shrimp n chips, onion rings and calamari.  Value For Money Spent I would say this is a \"good bang for your buck\" type of resto.  For individual foodies visting here I would say this falls into the single $ (as per yelp rating).  Normally for our couples budget we have a range from $15.00 - $30.00 CAD and this falls nicely within that even for the 3 person Haddock Family pack.  3 person Halibut family pack less of value, since you'll end up with only 3 pieces of Halibut, but I think the actual portion size ittself may be larger.  May have to try that out at a later date and verify the portion size for the Halibut.  Worth visting again?  Yes most definitely.  Curious on their portioning of individual order of Halibut/Haddock/Cod/Shrimp/Scallop & chips.  Payment : as of our visit here, cash and debit are accepted along with credit card."}
{"text":"Here I am on Good Friday the busiest night for fish and chips.  Long story short i lucked out got a table  and my food in 20 min. One  word Delicious. Will be returning here. Small place with a few tables but very comfortable."}
{"text":"3 Stars... Been wanting to try this place for some time now considering I'm just a 10min walk away. Walked in and noticed the 80s decor but the place was very clean and not cluttered, that's definitely OK in my books. Greeted by a friendly lady and ordered the Halibut and Chips. A small plate with lots of food arrived. Large portion of fish, chunky fries, wedge of lemon, tiny/tiny portion or coleslaw (like one bite) and a wedge of lemon. Was also given 2 packets of tartar sauce. It would help if a larger plate was used. The fries were good, enough said. The fish batter was just right, crispy and light but not oily. The halibut was also fluffy and moist. I've had better but this is definitely a serviceable joint and I will return in the future."}
