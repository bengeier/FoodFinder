{"text":"Hands down the BEST RIBS in Toronto.  Never get the steak here.  Order Mexican ribs and you will never EVER order anything else on this menu."}
{"text":"We came here a few times. My husband just loves their ribs. To me, they are chewy and I like my ribs to be falling off the bone kind. So i had fish, which was good, kids had ribs and liked them too.
Service was different every time. Once our food arrived within 10 minutes and was great. Another time the waitress forgot to ask and delivered sauce on the side for our 6-year old's rib order and that was a disaster for her. The wait extended to more than half hour.
I'm rating based on the food, which is good. Yes, the place could use a renovation, plastic cups for sauces etc have to go. Dessert fridge looks 100 years old..."}
{"text":"An old favourite. TheSteak Pit has been sold and will be closing November 27, 2016. After 51 years in business, it is time to retire according to the owners. Many meals have been enjoyed here over the years and a well earned vacation has arrived for the owners. Always friendly service and well executed dishes in a dated but comfortable environment, this place will be missed ( especially the pickles)."}
{"text":"Service was excellent and the food was terrible. Ribs were very dry and had the gas/propane type taste to it. My wife had a New York steak which was average. Very $$$$. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"My wife and I visited this restaurant last night. I ordered a roast beef dinner with a baked potato and my wife ordered filet of sole. After waiting for over 30 minutes I was served the roast beef swimming in some liquid. It was a thick slice composed of 80 % fat and gristle and about 20 % meat. I called the manager over who apologized and replaced the prime rib with a 12 oz New York steak after another 10 minutes. The steak must have been previously frozen. It was really chewy and not very tasty and certainly indicative of an inferior quality beef.
I ate a little bit and left the steak. When the bill came I told the server that the steak was almost inedible- because it was very chewy. Her reply was\"its your opinion\". The bill for this lousy meal was over 80 dollars. I hardly think this was a bias on my part or \"my opinion\".  Had I known I would post a review I would have taken a photo of the roast beef.  It should never have left the kitchen and I've never seen a plate like that even in a lowly diner.  The manager clearly concurred as he whisked it away and delivered a steak - a nice gesture but they don't seem to be in the league of any decent steak house I've ever been to."}
{"text":"I have eaten here a few times. The food quality here is pretty good, lots of side dishes and delicious garlic bread to accompany your main course. Steaks are always cooked to order. The wait times are a bit longer than other steak places and they often have poor service due to short staffed shifts during dinner rush. The service here is friendly and they try to be nice but the main server that I always see (older moustached gentleman) can't hide his impatience and is a bit condescending when you ask about menu items. He acts like he doesn't have time to answer your questions or they are ridiculous which is really not a great way to make your patrons feel. Overall a good dining experience I would avoid the rush times and hope you get a friendly server."}
{"text":"I came here with my family and the food was amazing!!  My steak was made to perfection and it was scrumptious.  Everyone who had steak was very satisfied with their meal.  My sister had ribs and she wasn't too impressed.  I would have to say, if you love steak and want a great meal at a restaurant that feels like home, you should definitely come to the Steak Pit.

The desserts were amazing as well.  We all shared the Peliano and Cookies & Milk cheesecakes.  They were to die for!  Everyone preferred the Peliano.  This was definitely the best meal I have had at a restaurant in a long time!!

The Steak Pit is a delicious hidden gem in the heart of north york.  If you want a great steak, you should definitely try it out!!"}
{"text":"Perhaps the best surf and turf I've ever had. I could have eaten twenty of those delicious lobster tails. The service is tops, and it has a real family run business vibe. You feel like they're taking care of one of their own."}
{"text":"background: my friend and I are both Chinese, and we have not tried any stlyle of steak before. Mostly we go to Chinese, Japanese and Korean restaurant.

So, this is our first time went to a steak house. My friend and I both had the medium well Steak and Ribs.we shared a chocolate cake, and drink two green tea. 

Forget all the background! Steaks are great, Ribs are great, and cake is great!

Great!"}
{"text":"My husband and his friends were craving steak so we decided to go to steak pit as they had previously came here a few weeks ago. Once we entered the owner (i'm guessing) immediately remembered my husband and his friends (2 others) he was super friendly, sat us down and took our order after awhile. Not only was he friendly but he actually remembered my husband and his friends order last time!! and knew exactly how they wanted there steak done. You dont find service like this anymore so I was pretty impressed. 

I, on the other hand, didnt order steak but ordered their ribs. This is not your usual BBQ ribs where the BBQ sauce is grilled on it so I was scared it was gonna be dry. but it actually amazed me!! even tho i ordered the sauce on the side I didnt need it cuz it was sooo flavourful and the meat was so tender it shocked me. The sauce they offer on the side isnt bbq sauce it's some mexican sauce that taste a little weird to me but it wasnt bad. But I prefered to eat it without it. 

This isnt your fancy steak resturant so the price isnt too high compared to other steak resturant and the service is superb. The decor is a little on the old side but since the ribs were so good I DEF AM COMING BACK!!"}
{"text":"a staple for special celebration dinners for my family for more than 40 years.
Old school fancy - linen table cloths, burnished brick walls, lemon finger bowls, uniformed wait staff.
Forget the menu. You only need to know about the mexican style rack of ribs with choice of potato and the chocolate cream pie.
Come early if it's a weekend, and tuck yourself in for a little piece of yesteryear. 
A place like this makes you wonder what ever happened to the 3 martini lunch."}
{"text":"This is one of those old school steakhouses that your parents reminisce about. The place has that 70/80's fine dining vibe to it. A bit dingy, but definitely fun and nostalgic to those who have seen this place in its prime. 

The food was very decent. The entrees come with a plethora of side dishes and starters. They bring you a plate of pickles, olives, celery, green onions and full radishes to start which was a bit odd, the pickles were good though. Next comes garlic bread which was delicious and very garlicky, next were salads which was a bunch of iceberg lettuce and a single slice of tomato, and finally was the entree, served with a choice of potato. 

Most of our party had the ribs, which came with a \"Mexican\" sauce, which you can ask for on the side. The ribs are really good, they're not your typical fall-off-the-bone style, which I actually preferred. The sauce has a sweet tomato flavour which was good on the ribs, but they were also great just plain. One person tried the rib steak which was flavourful and juicy. 

The prices were decent here, much cheaper than higher end steakhouses like Morton's, more in line with The Keg or potentially even cheaper. It's a super casual, family friendly restaurant. 

Unfortunately where this place loses stars is it's unoriginality. I'll likely forget about the meal I had here as there wasn't anything truly exquisite about the flavour, service or ambiance. 

I would come back if I was invited to go here for a specific occasion but I don't think I'll be running back when options like The Keg offer the same or better selection."}
