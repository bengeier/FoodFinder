{"text":"Stopped by Portage Pi for some lunch. First off the lounge space was amazing !!  Free wifi and plenty of seats for me and my laptop   Made my way to the counter to order and couldn't decide on a handmade Pi or a Panini.  I went with the Wisconsin Pi. So yummy and filling, eggs, cheese curds and herbs. Ordered a local brewed soda and connected my laptop.   Friendly service and great atmosphere.  I will be back."}
{"text":"Located in the lobby of the Graduate hotel, I just got iced coffee here, which was really reasonable for (eyeballing) 16 oz or $1.58.

They had a decent spread of what looked to be homemade bakery items and a list of menu items for pressed sandwiches.

They're open daily from 6:30 am - 8:00pm"}
{"text":"Had a wonderful lunch here . Found it by chance but will go back every time we are in Madison. Delicious, interesting food and smoothies"}
{"text":"I've tried both sweet and savory hand pies and enjoyed them. Unfortunately, I've been served the wrong hand pie now on two separate occasions, but maybe it's just me. 

Prices seem a bit high for what you get. You'll be spending around $10 for a pie and a drink. 

Portage also seems to be a popular study spot, with a long, narrow table in the middle of the cafe with plenty of outlets and good lighting. Despite this, I've never had a issue finding a seat like some of the other coffee shops in town. 

Parking can be a bit more difficult to find in the area, especially during Terrace season."}
{"text":"I almost hesitate to write this review, because once others find out about how good the coffee and salads are at Portage, and what a fantastic place it is to work, it's going to be overrun. But it's hard not to swoon upon entering and seeing the La Colombe coffee they sell and serve, beautiful fresh salads to go, and warm atmosphere resplendent with Wisconsin nostalgia. I will be back, as much as I can, until too many others become wise to how great it is."}
{"text":"Mmm this is guuud pie! I had a buy one get one free with Red Card so I split the apple hand pie with a friend and took a chicken one home for dinner. The apple one was good; the chicken one was OUTSTANDING even a few hours later! I microwaved it about a minute on each side and it was perfect. The chicken was tasty and the potatoes and veggies in it were flavorful. Try it!"}
{"text":"This place is extremely unique. Fantastic space. Great hand pies smoothies and fresh juices. Coffee is fantastic and local tap beer!"}
{"text":"Such friendly staff and decent coffee but they have a chance to be so much more and somehow missing that opportunity.  The hand pies are just average for the high price and any specialty drinks they might be able to make are obscured by the lack of clear menu/visuals.  I stayed at the hotel last night, came here his morning, then went to Colectivo for a masala chai and pastry.
I ordered the blueberry pie, which seemed to have a filling reminiscent or curdled milk, but was ricotta once.  Threw it out.
On the way back to the hotel, I saw they had a sandwich board outside advertising a specialty coffee drink, which I never saw inside or would have started there."}
{"text":"I'm giving Portage Pi an optimistic 3 stars. I think it has so much potential and I'm really excited about it, but there are a few major areas that need improvement. 

The space is gorgeous! An awesome alternative to a coffee shop for getting things done. I saw a lot of outlets. Apparently they're expanding to include outdoor areas as well.

The food is pretty good. I liked my Wisconsin Pi (cheese curds, ham, egg) but my roommate wasn't crazy about her short rib pi. Thought my smoothie was great. 

My real gripe is the price. $6 for a smoothie and $6 for a very small pie. I think they could make the pies a little bigger and then I would be happy to pay the money. 

It also took like 10 minutes to make my smoothie. Hire more staff or find a more efficient process, please!"}
{"text":"This is a really adorable space inside the Graduate, perfect for 'gramming if you so desire. It looks like it can also be a popular study space, and I really appreciate the dual usage. here is a meal set where you can order a pie, a salad and a drink for $12, and it's a solid deal compared to paying a la carte. That said, it is a little pricey for what you get. The packaged salad I had had high quality ingredients but wasn't particularly textually varied (there was a lot of spinach), and I think the sweet pies might be a better bet than the savory one that I had which had a particularly high crust to filling ratio, where the filling wasn't really being absorbed by the crust (though I definitely want to check out that Wisconsin Pi!). I swapped out my drink for an iced coffee, which was okay."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, fresh salads, delicious juices. Try the Bluto (pineapple, apple, coconut, and mint) if you can! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I wish Portage Pi took advantage of the charming space they have, because they could easily be the coolest coffee shop in town with some improvements in service and quality of products.

I went around 9am on a weekday morning to get some work done. The other reviews are correct in saying students use this coffee shop as a study spot. PP seems to encourage it by offering payment with Badger Cash and a printing station that I noticed multiple students use. I also saw multiple students leave and return to bring in sandwiches from Collectivo. Maybe they have an aversion to the savory pies that are served by this establishment?

I ordered a regular drip coffee along with a veggie pi. The coffee came out right away after I found a seat at the long wooden table in the middle of the room. Nice touch with the plethora of outlets. I waited 10 minutes for the veggie pi and when I asked about it, the barista said she forgot. Then, it came out REALLY hot. Food does not seem to be their strong point, judging by the other items available. The pie did taste decent.

One thing that really caught me off guard when I first arrived was the lack of clarity in their menu. They have a paper menu, a chalkboard, and a letter menu hanging behind the coffee bar, all with different levels of detail. The paper menu seemed to be the most comprehensive, but still didn't have many items on it. I kept looking for common espresso drinks and couldn't find any other than the \"bonfire mocha,\" which was the special. Looking online, it looks like they do have those on a separate page, although the online menu is also askew with it showing up incorrectly (double side-by-side).

This place is worth a stroll through to check out the cute interiors, but there are better places to get coffee mere steps away."}
