{"text":"My family dined here for years but every time we come in the service and food have gone low and horrible. This last visit was the worse, my husband and I ordered the fajitas, they were full of grease and over seasoned and dry nasty. We've had upset stomach since. Sadly we will not return again."}
{"text":"I've always been curious about this place since the handful of times we have been to Eldorado Casino, Mariana's has been closed. We felt a little excited to see it was open last night and after a little machine action, we got hungry and decided to try Mariana's. First time eating here. LAST time eating here. The prices are low, the menu small but when browsing the menu there seems to be some good choices....until your food arrives. I'm a sucker for awesome chili verde or pork carnitas. No chili verde on the menu so I opted for the carnitas, especially since a woman walked in and placed a to-go order asking for the carnitas. I figured since she seemed like a regular (the cashier and waitress both addressed her by first name), she was familiar with the carnitas and it must be awesome, right??!! NOPE. As soon as the waitress set my plate down, I could tell it was going to be a disaster. The pork looked very dry and when I took a bite out of it, my fears were confirmed. I rarely ever send food back, but I did last night. I couldn't even chew the pork and had to gracefully remove it by napkin out of my mouth. I was very lucky to have a nice and understanding waitress that removed my plate and I ordered the fish tacos as a replacement. It was a a white fish and it may have been tilapia, which I absolutely hate. Didn't even think of this when I ordered it. I ate one taco and called it a night.  My husband had the steak fajitas, he loved it. They give you alot and he took some leftovers home. However between dinner and our way home, he was in the bathroom three times. Two stars are mainly for the workers from the host, to the busser, to the waitress.  They were very friendly and accomodating but I will never go back and I very highly do not recommend eating here to anyone."}
{"text":"I am surprised that I am the 1st to review Mariana's....  Anywho, this place is a Mexican restaurant located inside the (in)famous Eldorado Casino on Water St in Downtown Henderson.  It is only open on Friday/Saturday.  I am not sure if they take reservations, since I've never attempted to make them, but there can generally be a wait to be seated.   It is not a very large place - there is a host stand when you first enter, and a small bar as well.  There are booths on both walls, with tables up the middle of the restaurant.  On the back wall there is a self serve salsa bar.  They usually have about 6 different salsas, ranging from mild to super hot habanero.  When you are seated, a busser (or server's assistant, whatever you want to call them) will bring you fresh chips with a cheese dip and a warm bean dip (both delicious).  The menu is pretty typical - this isn't the most authentic place on Earth.  You'll find enchiladas, chile rellenos, fajitas, etc.  They also have steaks and seafood, along with fish tacos and other entrees.  I have never ordered a steak there, I just think I would be disappointed.  But they do have a steak and lobster special for $35.99, which seems a bit overpriced for this restaurant.  I've had quite a few things on the menu, but nothing is really worth noting.  While the beef fajitas come out on a large, sizzling platter and are served with tortillas (obviously), rice, beans, sour cream and guacamole - the meat tends to be lower quality and over cooked, making it chewy and tough.  The service is friendly, but a little bit slow.  There are usually only 2 servers working, and they can get a little backed up if the tables are full.  I have been here quite a few times.  I keep going back because I receive free meal coupons from the casino every couple of weeks.  It's not a bad spot when it's free!"}
