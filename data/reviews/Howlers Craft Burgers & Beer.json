{"text":"Grady has some Great cocktails!
Nice draft beer selections and excellent wait staff-  Thanks Kat!  

Burgers and hotdogs!  Great place to eat and watch sports! Do it!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere.  Very good burgers and a great selection of local craft beers.  But when you go, you gotta try Pam's Adobe Dogs. You can't go wrong when you combine hot dogs and bacon!  Your taste buds will thank you."}
{"text":"Went on a Thursday night - they were VERY slow. Bartender was nice but seems a little lost. Burgers were pretty good. Might come back, might not. Meh."}
{"text":"I'm tempted to rate 5 just to bring up there average. 4 stars is an accurate rating for Howler's. Food is good. Especially apps and burgers.  Good local beer selection. We had a group of 14. They busted their hump to accommodate. Was a little slow but that is to be expected with a large group. Based on reviews, I think if they can figure out how to get the food to the tables faster this place will blow up. Everything else is there."}
{"text":"So we waited 45 minutes and the waitress never even came by to refill our drinks. Never brought our appetizers and was generally rude. The manager was no better when we asked about when our food would arrive. He blamed it on supply problems? If you don't have something tell the customers not just let them wait. We will never be back. Giving 1 star because I can't give it zero."}
{"text":"We came on Sunday morning after church and received 10% off for having a church bulletin. I had the Reuben and sweet potato fries. The sandwich was perfect.  The fries had cinnamon sugar on them which I'd rather not have, but they were cooked well. My daughter had the BLT. The T was a fried tomato she said was delicious. Her tater tots were perfectly crispy on the outside. We will definitely come back one evening when the have live music."}
{"text":"Great concept - needs improvement to be truly great. My husband and I brought our son, my parents, and sister here, and the general reaction was that this restaurant has a lot of promise, but it's not living up to that potential...yet. This is an aspirational review. We were really excited about the prospect of a craft brew and burger place being in Gastonia, but one of the keys to what makes craft food attractive is the quality of the ingredients, and it is clear that the food here is very conventional, which to me lacks flavor and is not worth the extra cost. The types of burgers were interesting, but the food came to us very greasy, and it lacked the flavor that comes with local or especially fresh ingredients. We did enjoy the beer, nice selection. Our server was also very nice. We were very uncomfortable when we sat down because the sun was directly in our faces - no blinds to block the sun. We moved to a table that had less direct sun, but it was dirty from a previous party I assume. As a mom of a young child, I was horrified by the floor throughout the place, which was covered in grease, spilled drinks, and bits of food. My husband said that his feet slowly slipped apart as he stood to see the beer selection at the bar, just because of the amount of grease on the floor. I did not hide my disgust in my facial expression at the floor, which a server saw, but instead of getting someone to clean up the floor, she shuffled off to the back with an offended look on her face and then went on about her work. No one cleaned the floor while we were there. I'd be willing to go back (my husband less so), but I would hope for fresher ingredients, a better seating area, and a cleaner floor."}
{"text":"I think Howlers could be good, but it fell very short. The best part of our meal was the wings. We ordered Caribbean jerk, and although I am not sure that is a good description of the taste, the seasoning was delicious. For a burger and beer place, we were surprised they did not ask us how we wanted our burgers cooked. Then they came out very well done, way overcooked. They have a nice craft beer selection, but they don't have printed menus of the beers they are currently offering and our waitress couldn't tell us, so we had to physically get up and go look at the board near the bar. The worst part was that the beer was very, very warm. I will not be making a trip back to Howlers anytime soon."}
{"text":"We stopped in yesterday for a mid afternoon brew and appetizer.  The craft beer selection was impressive and best of all they were mostly if not all NC breweries.  It's great to see that type of support for our state.  In addition the staff were very friendly and attentive.  We enjoyed a serving of fried pickles and their wings.. oh their wings.  So tasty and meaty.  The presentation of the food was spot on and worthy of a photo.  I have posted one of the wing pics on their profile here.  Warning, the pic may cause your mouth to water.  :)  

We had no idea the GM (Dennis) was in the building, but he noticed we were snapping pictures of our food and the environment.  He stopped by for a quick chat and was very friendly and professional.  

I would recommend Howlers to anyone wanting a cold craft beer (or two... or three...  :) ) and tasty food with a fun atmosphere and friendly staff."}
{"text":"California burger was delicious!! Spinach artichoke dip was a weird consistency. I wasn't a fan. Sweet potato fries were crisp and fresh. Wings were fantastic. Service was pretty good. Cleanliness was ok."}
{"text":"I come in about once a week and it's amazing! The beer is always cold, the burgers are spectacular and the atmosphere in itself is great! It's place is basically amazing!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food, interesting burgers, GREAT sweet potato fries, chips and onion straws as well as an above average selection of craft beer. 

Will definitely return to make this place a regular Sunday hangout. 

Also, I love the outside seating and the chalk the kids get to draw with :)"}
{"text":"A great date night place, especially with Ben and Jerry's next door for dessert. I went out on a limb with the granny smith apple/caramel burger with a chicken breast instead of a burger. It was great! Definitely a big portion: I could barely finish 1/3 of it. I got the onion straws on the side, but I wouldn't get them in the future. Kind of dry- you're better off sticking with fries. 

Not to mention the service was great. Our waitress was very patient explaining different dishes and drinks, and kindly waiting while I took way too long  to decide. We'll definitely be going back to try some other their other great grub and beers."}
{"text":"Went there for the very first time today for lunch.  Ordered the $6.00 lunch special burger.  Service and burger were both excellent.  Out the door for $6.95 after tax not counting the tip.  I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"We were not disappointed with the food for the price.  They have a great selection of burgers, sandwiches and salads.  The burger was fresh meat and hand packed not the typical \"perfect\" preformed garbage from other places.  Yes the service was slow (why the 4 stars) and needs to improve but the staff was extremely friendly.  I chalk it up to a new place with new staff.  I know they have a \"brewer\" night so that could be fun.  Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"This place is astonishing  fuck yeah the burgers are awesome everything is great, the people are the best abd I love the atmosphere here the best burger place in North Carolina I high recommend howlers to everyone."}
{"text":"We went and had lunch on a Sunday. Food was really good. Loved the pickle spears and my burger was awesome. We had a little trouble in the beer department, as the system was down and all the beer was warm. The service was good and I appreciate when the manager comes over to chat and apologize, which he did. I would absolutely return!"}
{"text":"We love wings and beer and were excited when Howlers opened. We stopped in on a Sunday for lunch around 1230 on our way to the dog park. The bar was empty except for us so we expected great service. We ordered a draft IPA, a bottled beer, wings and a grilled chicken sandwich. The wings were pretty good, beer is a no brainer, then the chicken sandwich arrived. It was a burger, which would have been ok if the bartender had not insisted she put it in correct then pulled all the kitchen tickets to prove it. Turns out she had put it in wrong. By now it was after 130 and we did not have time to wait for them to remake it. We can't say much about the food at this time. If we go back I will do a new review. I have no issue paying $10 for a burger if the service doesn't suck!"}
{"text":"Before I get into why 3 stars I will say the food was very good.  Ordered fried pickles, chicken wings and cheeseburger.  The pickles took 40 minutes.  The rest took 20 more minutes.  Now you might say they were busy.  I've  waitressed a lot.  It was less than half full.  No customers at bar most of time we waited.  The food was good and I would go back for that.  I think the kitchen and wait staff need better training.  Kitchen needs help."}
{"text":"Maybe this is too little, too late. Word on the street has it that these guys are closing their doors as of today. Bummer - they had pretty decent food and a great beer selection. These are the same owner's who took over Newt's in Shelby, NC awhile back.

Not sure of the exact circumstances, but they opened up Howler's to give it another go in the Craft Burger/Craft Beer arena. The new space is much better and more spacious. The prices are fair although maybe locals aren't ready for a $9-$10 burger. The restaurant industry is pretty well saturated in Gastonia and I've seen some awesome places have to shutter their doors.

Last time in I had a really nice burger with deep fried jalapenos - was the burger of the day which is only $6 with a side. And of course Bengali IPA is one of my faves.

If what I heard is true, they will be missed - if not, check out their burger of the day!!"}
{"text":"So this place has some bad reviews, and if you ask the manager, staff, & anyone who has ever worked at a restaurant knows about growing pains & getting the right people together is a never ending task. 

I've been here twice so far that I've enjoyed. We will chalk the others to people who do well in interviews, but have poor work ethic/skill.  


Let's start with the good times. Each of those I've been waited on by Lyndsey. Once at random, and once by request. 

Well I requested off of look b/c she kinda  favors the blonde from Dazed & Confused a  bit, they aren't twins but it's there. Joey Lauren Adams I think was her name which makes her that much more adorable. For the record we don't know each other personally. 

First time was on my birthday, and she was so freaking sweet. She got the bartender to get me a drink that wasn't  on the menu, and even brought me out a cake!! She offered to sing, warned me of her mad skills, but I declined! We chatted instead.

Second time, I brought my god mother here. She loved it too. 

This woman  is a 72 year old spit fire with a potty mouth who hates just about everything!! She adores this place now! Except the parking lol she told me to put in a request for a rail car for elderly people.

Both times I was adventurous, and ordered the special of the day. I was not disappointed! I don't recall either burgers being on the menu, but they were both spectacular. The sides come out in these cool little wire baskets. 

If you have never had eggplant fries, I urge you to give them a shot!
I don't know who makes the ranch but that shit is worth mentioning too! 


Moving on the to beers... Holy craft beer!! It was pretty impressive for the location. I hope they continue to switch it out, and bring in more. If they continue to go upwards in service 

I have also been made aware of various activities they do at night, such as, trivia. I will have to check it out soon! 

All in all, give this place a shot, or another one if you got stiffed with a bad experience. They are trying!! 
I really want to be able to eat the special burgers they prepare!! 
Keep them changing & it's like a real life Bob's Burger!! 

The price for the special is FABTASTIC!! 6.99 for a good, filling meal!?!? Why yes please!! 

I'll probably be here this weekend."}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this place. Menu was cool and appealing. Ate on a Wednesday evening service was not that great. Ordered wings hot ( almost flavorless) and honey BBQ which I tasted like sweet baby rays nothing special. Also ordered Sasha cheeses fires were dry and cheese wasn't even melted :( not impressed. Very sad. I may try it again and order a burger but wings are fries were a let down."}
{"text":"I usually don't write bad reviews bc I know the food industry is a helluva place to work. That being said, this is an honest review so others don't waste their hard earned money. Tried this place for the first time and we won't be back. Bland food that is overly priced; Five Guys Burgers is MUCH better and you don't have to wait 30 minutes for it. We started with the pickle fries; they were crispy but the batter didn't have a sprinkle of seasoning in it. I ordered the Steak Burger and my husband order the Granny Smith burger. Both were cooked beyond well done and once again, didn't have seasoning. The lack of flavor was confusing bc there were toppings! The wait staff needs more training; when you have to ask twice for the bill and the waitress still goes off to sweep and walk around the restaurant there's a lack of customer service training there. Really disappointed bc I wanted to like this place."}
{"text":"Really really good burgers with tons of choices and flair. Some traditional and some off the wall artisan style sandwiches. I choose the Barbados which featured a grilled slide of pineapple soaked in upscale rum. Nice friendly customer service and the time to get the food once I ordered was only 10 mins. They also feature daily specials!!!"}
{"text":"An hour and a half after arriving and going straight to a table, we are finally leaving.   10 minutes after we sat down we get our drinks. A tea and a water. Five minutes later our actual waitress comes by the table and ask if we wanted an appetizer.  15 minutes go by when the fried pickles come out. Very good pickles  and made us want to at least try the burgers.  The waitress takes our order when she drops off the app. And then, more waiting.  Yay.  Thirty minutes later, our two dry burgers are delivered. Not worth the wait."}
{"text":"Great menu, but poorly executed. Kitchen was afraid to use salt and pepper on the burger. Unfortunately, they weren't afraid to overcook the burger. Probably one of the worst burgers I've ever choked down. I love craft beer and burgers. I live nearby and want it to succeed. I'm doing the business a disservice if I don't share my experience. 

When we were there, it was very \"echo-y\" because of the high ceiling. It needed some music to counter that effect. We won't be returning anytime soon."}
{"text":"Favorite place in the area.  I wish the draft beer was colder.  It is warm sometimes."}
{"text":"Went here for Lunch today - I was planning for a Moe's burrito, but just kept walking - Sign said Burger Parmesan $6 so I went in - great burger prepared really fast. Got a side of tater tots and a Diet Coke for $9 - great vibe - good food - Nice people - I'm going back on Tuesday for Lunch - any burger with a side $6."}
{"text":"Waited about 40 min for a Chicago Dog... when I finally got it....I it was a wiener on a bun with sliced onions and dill pickle chips.....nuff said.. save your money and go to sonic."}
{"text":"Alright, so I have eaten here 5 times since they opened. I must say, overall I'm very impressed.

As far as burgers go, this place is top tier. Not only are they more than sufficiently sized, the patty itself tastes incredible. Plus their selection of fresh ingredients is unmatched. Definitely beats the hell out of Five Guys and Highway 55.

Their sides are great, I personally love the ranch onion rings and their fried pickles (the whole pickle is fried instead of slices). But the fries are hit or miss. Some days they have been superb, others...not so much. However, I go to places like this for the burgers, not the sides.

Gotta love the beer selection. Lots of craft beers and  great selections from local breweries such as OMB and Red Oak. Definitely hard to go wrong here, and the pricing is quite reasonable as well.

I see a lot of people complaining about the service, but I have yet to experience anything worth mentioning. Each visit of mine has been quite pleasant, and our servers have always been cheerful and hard working. We did have one meal where the food took a little longer than usual, but they were completely slammed. Besides, who cares? Have a beer, talk with your friends, relax and enjoy yourself. It's worth the wait."}
