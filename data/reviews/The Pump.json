{"text":"Went in here with a co-worker last Tuesday for some drinks.  We usually get sushi when we're in the area as it seems that's all there is - so this was a very welcome change!  They were having a special on pizza that night, so we both got one - I had a margherita, and they had pepperoni and bacon - both were delicious.  Found the servers to be really nice, and they had my favourite beer on tap (Beau's) which was a nice bonus.  Definitely will be back soon."}
{"text":"The Pump was a pleasant surprise in the Annex, and a great place for a post-work unwind. The inside is pretty much your typical bar with the exception of tons of TVs everywhere making it almost cross over into the sports bar category. When I got there around 7, the front of the bar was wide open as the huge \"garage door cum window\" was rolled up to brighten up the inside while creating some good people-watching spots inside. Got a little cool later so it was closed shut.  The offerings on tap (aka 'on the pump') were pleasantly surprising. They are: - Keith's Red (Nova Scotia) - Smithwick's Authentic Irish Ale - Guiness Irish Stout - Stella Artois Blond Lager (Belgium) - Moosehead Lager (New Brunswick) - Boddington's Pub Ale (England) - Bud Light (USA) - Wellington Special Pale Ale (Ontario) - Keith's India Pale Ale (Nova Scotia) - Hoegaarden White Ale (Belgium) - Leffe Abbey Brun (Belgium) - Kokanee Glacier Beer (British Columbia) - Labatt Blue Pilsner (Ontario) - Labatt 50 (Canada) - Amsterdam Blong Lager (Ontario) - Magner's Cider (Ireland)  They also had more bottled beverages and a decent wine selection (adjust expectations based on whether or not you're a wine connoisseur/snob).  The menu was bigger than your standard bar food offerings - everything from calamari to nachos, burgers and pizza to fish & chips and salads. They run food specials most days of the week after 5pm: Sundays you get half price nachos, Tuesdays you get half price pizza. I'll have to check back to find out what the other specials were.  They also do weekend brunch (11-3) so if you're in the Annex and need a good place to grab pub fare while a game's on, (or if you need refuge from the Brunswick House right across the street :)) you won't go wrong with The Pump."}
{"text":"5 stars for food 3 stars for service  3 stars for ambience   I like The Pump as a nice local neighbourhood bar. It would not be a go-to social spot but when you just need to hang out and have a drink and some unhealthy bar favourites in your jeans and a tee it's the right place to be."}
{"text":"Hit up the Pump last night for the hockey season opener. I was by myself (I seriously need to make some friends who like hockey here!), and a Habs fan to boot, but the bartender and owner sorted out a seat for me and were immensely nice. Also, it wasn't too loud.  The hockey rivalry divide seemed to be about 60% Leafs / 40% Canadiens. So very lively, plus they have the obligatory siren to ring for goals. The sound on the TVs was down pretty low, though - I don't think it was even on at the bar, so we couldn't hear Don Cherry! So that's a plus or a minus depending on your position on such matters.  Beer was 6.50 a pint though, which is too much. I hear the food is delicious.  Towards the end of the game the Leafs were up 3-2 and the bartender was asking if I'd like another beer, and I said I'd get one if it went into overtime. Then, when there were about 30 seconds left, he gave me a glass of water. It was hilarious, and I will love this bar forever just for that."}
{"text":"It's an okay place. A little too expensive for what it is honestly. I had a fish and chips and my date had the salmon penne. My fish was overcooked and exceptionally crispy (not in a good way)."}
{"text":"This place always caught my eye in the summer, because the glass windows would all be out of the way and people would just perch their basket of chicken wings by the brick \"fence\" and people watch.  Curiosity got the best of the cat, so one day a friend and I decided to check out since we were in the area.    I ordered a chicken breast dish, and my friend had a burger.  Both were.... Meh.  Soggy fries, protein that was not seasoned properly.  One of those places where you need hot sauce just to get it done and over with.  .It was so Meh, I thought food at Kelsey's was better.  To add to the disappointment, the prices were much higher than expected.    The service was quite lifeless as well... \"Hi.  What can I get you.\"  All in all... meh.  There are probably a hundred better places to eat in the Annex."}
{"text":"I love the Pump! the owner is great...funny guy and the place is very inviting and just a great sport bar. I cannot wait to have my next Super Bowl party there.  Also good they have gluten free pasta!!! yipeeeeeeeeeeeee"}
{"text":"The service here on the four times I've been here is excellent. Even on the busiest nights they always seem to have just enough waitresses which is a compliment considering most of these joints have cheap managers who understaff to save money.  The beer selection is pretty good and the menu is pretty vast. I disagree with people saying that the menu is \"standard pub grub\" because the menu features everything from pasta to burgers, fish, pizza, chicken, and other dinner-sized entrees. It's more than just your wings, fries and burgers that constitute a \"pub grub\" menu.  The place does look a little sketch from the outside especially with the ancient looking cement \"patio\" but it is actually really nice and cozy inside.  On game nights, they'll pull down the screens for the Leafs/Raptors/Jays games and there is a steak and beer special for $19.99 on the dates of those games.   The pizza calzones are excellent. A nice little place to enjoy a pint and a bite."}
{"text":"Went here with some friends to kick off the summer pub season, first impression is comfortable.   That being said it is a compliment, I was in the mood to unwind after classes and this place hit the spot with a pint of wellington and a pint of kokanee. good selection on tap. a bit on the pricy side for a student budget but in comparison to other pubs I've been to it was reasonable.  Been there twice, once at a table closer to the door and another time in a booth, must say that unless its an absolutely gorgeous day outside, the booths take the cake.  Might go there again, but the specials weren't stand outs so nothing separating this place from the pack.  Servers were polite, attentive and knew their selection on tap which was a plus rounding the score up to a 3."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been going to the Pump since opening day.  It offers everything we look for in a local pub... a long bar with ample seating, a garage door that opens to Bloor street when the weather is nice and lots of tv's situated over-head so there isn't a bad view to watch the game. A bar can have all of these geographical attributes going for it and still fail... unless it has the right staff, and the Pump has GREAT staff.... starting with their lead bartender and manager, Stu.  Stu sets the bar for everyone else employed there.... quick witted, a great conversationalist and the ability to set the \"right\" tone. You know how so many places are geared towards a certain age group so you either feel too old, too young or just out of place.  Not here... The Pump successfully caters to every age group.  My wife and I are in our early 40's, but are never the oldest or youngest in the bar. It's a perfect place to start your night with a great steak, or pizza and finish it with midnight shooters (ask Stu to make you a \"green tea\" or \"red headed slut\"). Price wise, there are cheaper places on the Annex, but you'll get what you pay for.  The food is better than your average pub and there are allot of draught selections (would like to see a few more local micro breweries thought) to chose from.  Whether you are a local who has yet to visit, or a tourist looking for a place that is comfortable and fun, The Pump is a great Annex option that I feel proud to call my local."}
{"text":"playoffs! That's probably the only reason you would come here.  It's a reasonable sports bar in the annex that I used to frequent. Back in the day it might have been deserving of 4 stars as the go to sports bar- surpisingly difficult to find a good tv-bar ratio atmosphere going on where you feel ok going there to watch sports but you also feel ok going there to catch up on some social time with a pint.  I'd rate it lower now that I've found better bars in better areas...but I have some pretty entertaining memories here.  Some so terrible I can't even believe they happened.   -One includes the time when one of the bartenders sassed me so much while I was at the bar and then FOLLOWED me to the washroom only to say that he was only being hard on me because he likes me... wtf...apparently we are in grade 2. -Another time includes meeting a real life pimp and me getting into a pretty loud and verbally violent argument about the way he exploits women. -An incredibly strange occurence when my friend and I were catching up at the bar and we got so silly and inebraited that we eventually took a breather outside and then left forgetting to pay the bill entirely- we called the bar the next day feeling so bad that we forgot to pay the bill and they told us that there were no outstanding bills that night!  bonus win! -One night me and my signif other were on a date when his ex and MY ex walked in at the same time TOGETHER and WE speculated if THEY were on a date.  WEIRD. -And one more night when they kept bringing the WRONG order of food out to our table but the waitress couldn't figure out whose it was so she just left it all at our table.. we ended up getting like 5 dishes when we only ordered one to share.  yes..this is a fairly ridiculous place.  And I feel like my money spent here has gone towards more stories than beer. And that's a-ok."}
{"text":"Just as a pub, the Pump isn't anything spectacular - but it's absolutely wonderful for watching big games, especially if you have a group. The booths can hold up to 6 people apiece, and you can see the TVs from pretty much any angle or seat. The booths work out well - and it's pretty sweet, as you can watch both the game and your friends' expressions.   The service is really good - no matter how crowded (and I've been there when it's packed), they always ensure that you aren't ignored or left alone for too long. Some of the servers are great characters, too.   The food is unremarkable - overpriced and smaller servings than I expected. But you're not here for the food, you're here to order pitchers while watching the game. And the Pump does that really well. Beer prices are okay as well."}
{"text":"Absolutely average.  I could easily forget the Pump if it wasn't located right at the top of my street.  I do like that they offer pitchers, as nearby Kilgour's doesn't and they do have a decent assorted menu.  Nonetheless everything was blah.  I ordered the Angus burger with a side ceasar and Onion rings.  The rings were heavily battered, the ceasar swimming in creamy generic dressing and the burger was almost soggy.  The pricing was decent, so couldn't complain to much and the Pump will do in a bind, but overall unremarkable in every way."}
{"text":"I stumbled upon The Pump with a friend while walking along Bloor Street.   The service is pretty good; I would even use the words 'fast' and 'efficient.' Menu items are your typical pub food, but the daily deals are pretty nice for your wallet. We ordered nachos, but on Sundays it's half-price off. The selection on tap is great! There are a lot of beers to choose from and I was happy about the price of their beers. It was very reasonable! Seating is a plenty and you can easily find a booth to sit at with friends.  I will be back."}
{"text":"We wandered in here on a Saturday night. The set up is nice, it feels pretty open. It's definitely a sports bar (lots of tv screens everywhere) but comfortable enough that you felt like you could watch a game but also be able to hear the person across from you. They were out of two kinds of beer (that was listed on the menu) - they were out of one so I chose another (that the waitress recommended) and that was out too. Oh well. I was surprised by how much they have on their menu - it seems like a lot.  We ordered an Arugula pizza. It was pretty meh. It had sauce, a tiny bit of cheese a  few halved baby tomatoes and some (not terribly fresh) arugula thrown on top. I've had this pizza in some other places and it was amazing - not so here. Pretty bland and disappointing mostly just tomato sauce. The only thing half decent about it was the thin crust (as they do have a pizza oven). Our waitress was great, on the ball and constantly checking to make sure everything was okay. I would be willing to try the food one more time. Otherwise an okay place to just have a beer."}
{"text":"No-surprises-but-solid beer list, super noisy acoustics, jam-packed on weekends, great service.  They have a fine spread of local toronto brews and some good imports, but nothing out of the ordinary for a bar that's decided to move beyond Labatt/Molson. Like most places on Bloor, this place gets sardine-can'y on the weekend, which can be fun in a small group. The acoustics in this place are mysteriously awful, and between the stereo, high-ceilings, and full crowd, I lost my voice over the course of two hours talking (screaming?) to my friend across the table (!) - despite the deplorable server-to-guzzler ratio, never had to wait once for refills."}
{"text":"Its not a bad place if you are looking to grab a drink, the food is decent. I had the nachos and a the home styled beef burger. The burger is recommended and it was half price nachos Sunday!"}
{"text":"En route to Hart House for Twelfth Night (which was hilarious, by the way,) we stopped in here in mutual craving for pub grub.   The draft options were good, our server was quick, and the booth was cozy.   It's also really well designed inside: pressed tin ceilings, wood panelled walls, and soft glass lightshade. And while the vast majority of bars on Bloor smell like ancient spilled beers and middle aged tears, this place is striking a nice balance between old pub decor and clean floor.   Minus two stars for the menu, which is..eh. I wanted fish and chips, and maybe I just didn't look hard enough but I could only find a fish sandwich. So...It's decent fish and chips, but you put the fillet between a hamburger bun? Now my boyfriend's ribbing me for not eating the bun, I feel weird, the bun feels weird, everyone is disappointed. D got wings, which he said were crummy. And this from someone who is pretty a-ok with Old Man Pizza and Wings on Jameson Ave, so that's saying something.  Ultimately, if you want to coze up and have a pint, this place is a really nice option. Just get a few drinks in you and the food will probably be fine."}
{"text":"I recently discovered The Pump. It has everything you could ever want in a neighborhood pub: the atmosphere is great, the prices are reasonable, and most importantly,  the beers are always cold! Service is swift and efficient. The TVs play whatever game is on, and the music is pretty good, though, it is mostly classic stuff.  Try the sweet potato fries. They are delicious!"}
{"text":"It was Sunday evening and my friend and I were looking to grab a quick cheap bite to eat.  We came across the pump which I've always wanted to check out. So ee went in and were quickly seated. The waitress told us that Sundays is half price nachos and  I think it was 15$ pitchers of that drink with wine and fruits and some other liquor. So we ordered that!  The food and deinks were fab!  The bill was only 20$ and we got prerty drunk. 5$ Sunday nachos were very good! Pretty big too!!"}
{"text":"The food is not bad, but the best part about the Pump is the seating section fronting out on Bloor; GREAT for people watching."}
