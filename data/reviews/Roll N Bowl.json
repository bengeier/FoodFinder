{"text":"What a great little Scarborough gem! The menu features both Korean and Japanese food so gives you a good variety. The sushi rolls are creative and also tastes great. Really admire the craftsmanship! Most importantly the atmosphere is clean! I can't wait to come back and try other things on the menu. Don't miss out!!"}
{"text":"First time ordering here, found through Just Eat - overall very impressed with the quality of food.  We are regulars at Ninji and found this a nice change.  There are some items that only Roll N Bowl has that we will be back for.   Spicy Salmon salad is so yummy and will be a regular item for us. Sashimi Don is also good - Rice was severed separately and a bit awkward to mix together - but note its big enough for 2 people.  Rainbow roll was better than I expected - its not the same old, same old rainbow roll.  They also threw in a free roll with our order  We are definitely returning customers.  I cant wait to check out the Korean menu and experience the sit-in experience."}
{"text":"I love this place! Their sushi is so good. Portion sizes are generous. They have torched sushi as well (aburi), which is delightful. The prices are extremely reasonable. The restaurant has a nice, cozy ambience.   If you're interested in Korean food, they have plenty of options. My BF and I like the spicy bulgogi. Additionally, they have bento boxes for both lunch and dinner. They are very flexible about substituting California rolls for spicy salmon rolls for only a dollar or two.   My bf and I go here all the time now. It's a go-to for us! Very happy to have this place in Scarborough."}
{"text":"Overall Impressions: 5.0 stars based on my visit and select sampling of their food. They nailed it with the food, service and very reasonable prices. I'll be back to try more rolls for sure at this gem of a restaurant.  Food: I had started with gyoza, which were hot and crispy.  I had the pressed tuna aburi sushi. The tuna was so soft and each pressed sushi was drizzled with spicy mayo and a slice of jalapeño pepper.  Based on the server's suggestion list, I picked the fantastic roll. It had shrimp tempura, kappa, avocado roll and was topped with torched tuna tomato masago with garlic mayo. Just thinking about the sushi I had makes me hungry lol.   Service: The server was very friendly. He came by a few times, made great menu suggestions, and topped up my tea. I was very pleased overall. The ambience was clean and welcoming. When the bill came, I was really surprised how full I was for the quality of food and service I received."}
{"text":"Awesome Korean/Japanese restaurant! We had Spicy chicken and regular chicken bi bam bap, which was really yummy! Owners were super hospitable and provided us with a delicious set of Maki California rolls with spicy mayo on the house! Seems like a family owned restaurant, which was refreshing to see. Servers were friendly and very welcoming. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Restaurant is in an unassuming Scarborough plaza.  Inside is much nicer than the plaza would suggest.  It is a smaller place but with nice furniture and décor.  The restaurant has a good combination of Japanese and Korean menu items and the selection is pretty large - there are a good variety of Japanese rolls as well as hot entrees.  While they make sushi, it was not a big part of their menu so maybe not a focus for them.  Lots of traditional Korean dishes as well.    The meal started with a small complimentary soup which is a nice touch.  We ordered the soft shell crab as an appetizer which was a good size and very good.  We also got a salmon roll and the amount of salmon in the roll was much more than we would have expected.    I ordered the Bi Bim Bab with beef.  It comes with a generous amount of vegetables and rice and is served to you with the ingredients cooking in a hot stone pot.  Kimchi and hot sauce on the side for the delicious Korean spice.  My wife ordered the Tempura Udon noodle soup and my daughter ordered the Salmon Teriyaki.  The amount of salmon was very generous - she felt there was a bit much of sauce.  Only minor complaint is that in this small restaurant there was a TV that had the volume loud and we had to listen to the reports of murder and other crimes from the six o'clock news which was a bit of a downer.  The meal was terrific for flavor and was very filling.  Price was reasonable.  Including 1 alcoholic drink, tax and tip, it was $80 for three people.  We were very pleased with this new discovery and will definitely be back.  Recommend for you to try."}
{"text":"Two servers looked after our group and the food came out in a timely manner.  The restaurant had several customers mid week for the dinner crowd.  Good service and a pleasant atmosphere."}
{"text":"Delicious food, beautiful presentation! The service is very friendly. We had a bit of a wait on a couple of items, but they graciously gave us gyozas on the house for making us wait. I like the variety of dishes on the menu, there's lots of Japanese and Korean options. The sashimi was fresh and the rolls are very delicious. The SOS roll is a must-have for those that enjoy spicy flavour!"}
{"text":"I ordered delivery twice, the first time is was fast and good (got chicken katsu don and takoyaki). the second time was just as fast and the delivery man was very kind. I go to open up my meal of don kastus (pork) and kara-a-ge when i see a little box with a heart and the words \"free enjoy\". I open and there inside is fried gyoza! I was so shocked, I felt bad i didn't tip more. What a wonderful place! I can't wait to visit, what a wonderful new place! go try it the food is just as good as the service i got."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch on Saturday after reading the great reviews and we weren't disappointed. All the food was tasty and fresh and the service was great. My dad was recently in Korea and said the Bibimbap was as good or better than any he had there. Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Really good sushi!! So happy they opened up near home and they deliver. Service was good and  food was great! Will come back again."}
{"text":"We decided to stop by since we were in the area and i've been seeing this place all over instagram.   We ordered the Rainbow Dragon Roll, White Dragon Roll, Spicy Salmon Rolls, Chicken Katsu Don and the Spicy Pork. The worst item would have been their Spicy Pork. Very hard to chew, dry and nothing special in flavour.  As for their rolls, I haven't tried much torched sushi before but the rainbow dragon and white dragon were amazing. I definitely would prefer the white dragon over the rainbow, it's much more creamier.  The staff were extremely friendly, attentive and even gave us a miso soup on the house!   We had a great experience here, but their prices are a little high in my opinion. I probably would only come back for their lunch menu, which is a reasonable price for me."}
{"text":"We've been there 6 times since it opened a month or so ago. The Fantastic Roll is truly fantastic. Love that they also have Korean dishes, the sashimi rice (hae dup ban) and Soon Tofu.  Very friendly servers. And there is a loyalty card which gives you a free appetizer after four visits."}
{"text":"Ok, before everyone starts freaking out with the three stars I just want to say, this place isn't terrible nor is it amazing. It find it pretty much on par with every other a la carte.   Came by for dinner with some friends and ordered a bunch of items. We got the sushi & sashimi dinners, two rolls, spicy beef ramen with a spicy salmon roll and a teriyaki beef combo.   The spicy beef ramen wasn't spicy (at all) and it honestly looks like shin ramen package and the teriyaki beef was too chewy. The sushi is fresher than other a la carte with reasonable pricing ~10-15/roll but nothing really stood out.  Their staff is super friendly and the place is small but clean. I may come back to try their aburi."}
{"text":"New place that opened across the street from Niji. This is a good budget sushi place, with fresh fish, large portions and solid prices. Service is very friendly too! It's about half the size of Niji. Like Niji, it's Korean run which means there's a Korean side of the menu that I haven't really tried yet like gamjatang, galbi, bulgogi, and bibimbap.   I recommend the sashimi don (hwe du bap) which is a massive portion of assorted vegetables, cubed sashimi chunks, spicy sauce, and a bowl of rice. It could easily feed two people!   They don't offer an a la carte menu for sushi and are currently applying for their liquor license, but they do have aburi sushi which is pretty good. I got to sample their aburi spicy california and it was the bee's knees!"}
{"text":"I found this place on Yelp, of course. I brought my sister and her boyfriend here one evening. I got the vegetable bi bim bab having never tried this Korean dish before. It comes with miso soup and a garden salad, but we also got a bowl of noodles with some broth. I loved the hot stone pot this dish comes in. It keeps your food warm until the very end. It was also very filling so I took half home and ate it for lunch the next day. I thought it was really good, but have nothing to compare it to. My sister tried the pressed Aburi Sushi and the salmon pizza and found both to be well presented and tasty. Her boyfriend had the bi bim bab as well and said it was good, but he's had better.  Service was great and they have nice presentation of their food with lots of menu options. If I'm in the area again, I will probably stop by and try something from their sushi roll menu."}
{"text":"Solid 4.25 for food and another. 0.5 for their super sweet and accommodating service. Came here for lunch on a Saturday. We had the Takoyaki, aburi sushi, PEI roll, lobster dynamite roll and a bulgogi. Everything was great, but the Takoyaki was surprisingly amazing. The rolls were huge and well flavoured and the fish they used was fresh. I preferred the tuna aburi to the salmon but both were good. I think our only food complaint was that there was a bit too much rice in the sushi and in the rolls, and we couldnt really taste much lobster. But for the value, and the taste, we had no complaints. The owner was also super sweet and friendly and gave us a roll to try. All I'm saying is, we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Although this place is not AYCE, it's totally worth the visit to come. They've got a great Korean mix in there as well, so even if you don't like sushi, you can still come. I came around 5pm for an early dinner and it was a great deicison. The space is a little small so I'd you're coming after 630, expect to wait. I loved the spicy bulgogi. It was really great. The service was also really great and even though there was a line, we never felt like there was a rush to get us out of there. Would definitely recommend!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food!  Excellent service!  Really flavourful and fresh soups. I had the spicy pork neckbone soup which was absolutely delicious and very generous in it's portion size.  The dynamite roll was also very impressive in it's presentation and portion size as well as it's overall quality and taste (it was a challenge to put the whole bite in my mouth at once). Seriously fresh and quality ingredients.  The total bill come to around $22.50. Inexpensive great food."}
{"text":"???????????????????????????????????????????Sushi ????Lunch ?????"}
{"text":"Rating - 3.0/5.0  A new Japanese restaurant just popped up across from Niji on Midland and Ellesmere. It is run by a Korean family and they serve Korean food as well. The place was quite busy when I was there but they have quite a bit of staff working there.  Tuna Pressed Aburi Sushi ($11.95) - Not a bad option for the price if you have not ventured into aburi sushi and want to give it a try. Tuna was nice and soft but there was a bit too much sauce for my liking which overtook the essence of the tuna. Don't bother trying this if you have already had aburi sushi else where.  Roll and Bowl Roll ($17.95) - This comes with shrimp tempura, crab meat, avocado, kappa, salmon, masago and BBQ eel. This roll was unfortunately underwhelming and I assume it's supposed to be their flagship roll. There was very little eel in the roll and the taste resembled more like an upgraded california roll. The preparation of this roll was noticeably better so there appears to be a consistency issue.  Legend Spider ($15.95) - This comes with spicy scallop on spider roll with dried shrimp powder. I liked the overall taste and texture of this roll over the Roll and Bowl Roll. However the presentation of the rolls lacked the preciseness in terms of the cuts and general workmanship.  For both rolls, the sushi rice had quite a bit of vinegar and sweetness to it. I do like this flavour but would be better if they could dial it down a bit. Also there was a bit too much moisture in the sushi rice and lacking some firmness.  As there are better options in my area (i.e. Oyaji or Mine Sushi on Elgin Mills) I will likely not be back as it is quite out of the way for me. However, if you're in the area and looking for sushi that gets the job done then give this place a try. Personally I have not tried Niji so cannot comment on which one is better."}
{"text":"Had the udon noodle soup here with beef. Nice place, service was a little slow, but friendly. My coworkers got the lobster and scallop roll and the teriyaki bento and they both really enjoyed their meal, so the extra star is for them.  I thought the noodles were nice, nice flavourful broth, but not enough meat pieces or veggies.   I'd come back, but I wouldn't get the udon noodles again."}
{"text":"Excellent spot for a quick and delicious lunch or dinner. Service was courteous and attentive. Menu is priced fairly. I would recommend this restaurant to sushi and Korean food lovers!"}
{"text":"Very clean and quick service. I had the bi bim bap and was very pleased. I was offered more rice in case it was too spicy. Overall if in he ara again I would go back"}
{"text":"Had the sashimi don and takoyaki. Very generous entree portions and it's more like a healthy assorted sashimi dish on varietal veggie bed, with rice on the side. Very fresh, beautiful presentation. Great service. Space could use a little more ambiance, but it's very clean and quite comfortable."}
{"text":"Since Toronto isn't next to the ocean, sushi isn't the cheapest but this place is very affordable.  I first checked this place out when I was going to Niji Sushi and the wait time for that was too long.  I went to Roll N Bowl and to my surprise the food was very affordable.  Service was always good.  The staff were all very friendly and the best part is that they offer delivery!  It's also available on Just-Eat.    I tried the California Rolls (my fav), the Bento Box F, and the Sushi Dinner.  The Bento Box F is the best value out of all the things I've tried.  It came with salmon, stir-fried veggies, japchae, rice, sashimi, California Roll, miso soup, and house salad.  It's only available during lunch Monday-Saturday.  I was really full and actually didn't even finish the whole thing.    I would definitely recommend this place for the value you get out of it and the convenience of having delivery available in store and online."}
{"text":"This is a great place if you like lots of options and great service. The venue itself isn't too big, and isn't really pretty looking. We came in as a group of 9 and they were very accommodating in terms of seats and service. It's still better to book ahead of time.   We got a variety of soups and hard dishes. Everything was delicious and filling. The tofu soup which I had was the right amount of spice and flavour. If you are vegetarian however, the broth comes with fish so make sure to specify that you'd like it without."}
{"text":"Such an amazing experience!!  Food was served quickly, service was amazing!   There was simply nothing to complain about, except for the fact that the food was kind of cold.  Other than that, the food was delicious. I got the chicken bento box which comes with shrimp and vegetable tempura, rice, chicken teriyaki served with vegetables, miso soup and a couple of toner items all for $15! Although it was a bit overpriced, it was definitely worth it! You'll leave stuffed, and the sushi was amazing! So authentic and packed with flavour. One of my new favourites! Will be back for some ramen next time!"}
{"text":"Great value! Tasty dishes, generous portions and I like the homey environment. There's a lot of options to choose from and definitely a few special rolls that I would like to try next time.  We ordered the spicy chicken, tuna pressed aburi sushi, udon with tempura (probably my fav part of the meal as I was craving a soup-y meal), California rolls (+$2 to add to udon) and a few side dishes. Total with taxes and tips came to about $50. I was surprisingly really full after the meal.  A good option if you are in the area and looking for Korean/Japanese food options!"}
{"text":"Now I know that the Japanese/ Korean cuisine is not a new concept, but the area was in need of a Korean  menu (Otherwise you would have to go all the way up to Steeles to get your fix).  Our visit was around 1pm Saturday and the place was half full. Upon entry we were greeted by a lovely young lady who was attentive for the duration of our meal.  We order 2 pork bone soup, salmon sashimi salad and a kamikaze roll. Everything was delicious; (I felt they could have been more generous with the portion of the salmon sashimi). The meal came with a side appetizer which was \"meh\". No complaints about the service,  quality of food or pricing.   I will be back again very soon.  Just sorry I didn't try this place out sooner!"}
{"text":"Great new sushi place!  Located in a very small plaza with a small parking lot.  On the outside, it doesn't look like much, however, the inside reveals a quaint, clean and inviting space.  They have only been open about a month.  Not sure if this is a family owned business, but everyone was very sweet and polite.  Service was attentive, and although it took a bit longer for the food to arrive, our waitress was quick to apologize several times for the delay, and even brought us complimentary goyza,  which were superb.   We odered the fantastic roll, salmon aburi and seafood Ramen. The Ramen was very reasonably priced.  Some of the special rolls were a bit pricier, however, the rolls were quite large, well done, and the presentation was .   The fantastic roll was quite different than the typical rolls at other sushi places.    They do both take out and delivery.  I will definitely be frequenting this place again!!"}
{"text":"Overall an amazing experience. Our server was nice and the food came very quickly. We had the spicy salmon roll, unagi roll and the salmon and aburi sushi. The spicy salmon was probably my favourite. It had chunks of salmon with the spicy sauce which is better than a lot of other places that do it as they usually shred the salmon. The aburi is great but the only thing is that it was a little too saucey for my liking so it was too salty but still good! My friend and I also got complimentary hand rolls! Would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"When you feel like sushi and your friend wants Korean, this is a good compromise. They have your regular rolls like avocado/cucumber, California and salmon for $5-6 and then you speciality rolls going up to the $12 range. We got a salmon roll and avocado and cucumber roll and found both to be good for the price.  We got an order of edamame and it came last. I wasn't impressed by that.  We got some fantastic rolls sample on the house which was nice. It was ok but I found there to be too many items in the roll and it didn't compliment each other particularly well.  I also had an order of the kimchi ramen (instant noodle style). It was reasonably priced and tasted ok, nothing special, but it hot the spot for what i was craving.  The service was friendly and the seating area was fairly small, accommodating around 30 people total in the restaurant."}
{"text":"The hype over Roll N Bowl is pretty crazy.  It's located across from Ni-Ji, which has also been raved about and is considered to be a gem by most UTSC students in the area. Personally, I was never impressed by Ni-Ji. It was decent at best.  I was therefore game to try a newly trending Japanese-Korean restaurant in the area...and it too fell far from the pedestal on which the hype had placed it.  We arrived at 7pm on a weeknight and half the tables were empty.  However, by 8pm or so, it was a full house, which suggested that they probably have a steady traffic of customers.  The hype seemed to have been validated here.  Visual aesthetics was a key feature I noticed.  The interior decor consisted of black wooden tables, an open window from where the chef preps the food while facing towards the diners, and several woodblock-esque pictures that were hung on the walls.  The design makes for a pleasant space that leaves you feeling that the room is more spacious than normal, which enhances the comfort of having a private conversation within your party.  Furthermore, the food was beautifully plated. I would not bet that the chef had the best presentation skills because I have seen better at Hamaru.  However, the food still came out in its own trendy fashion and made for some nice foodgasmic shots.  Now, in terms of foodgasmic flavour, it was non-existent that night.  This is not to say that the food tasted terrible.  All the dishes had a decent flavour and I do honestly believe that most would enjoy themselves here. For me, it's just that nothing blew my socks off.  We ordered the Sashimi Dinner, which had very fresh fish, but none of it had a strong flavour.  You may want to discredit me because it's common for raw fish to lack flavour. Well, when you have high-grade sashimi, like the kind at Hamaru, you will agree that the fish at Roll N Bowl is of decent quality, but that's just about all there is to it. Additionally, we ordered the Ddukbaegi Bulgolgi, which is essentially beef stew with glass noodles. The beef was plentiful, but the noodles were scarce, making the dish less filling. Then, there was the takoyaki. My bf can be quite a takoyaki snob, and he found these to be decent, chewier and smaller than what we get elsewhere.  Last but not least, there were the orange slices. In place of the normative ice cream that follows a dinner meal at most Japanese restaurants, Roll N Bowl gives you oranges, and just one slice each to boot! I was very disappointed at this substitution. Frankly-speaking, if it weren't for the complimentary soba noodles in a warm broth that they served at the beginning, then I don't think I would have enjoyed the meal that night.  I don't believe I will be returning too often.  I would still choose Roll N Sushi if I had to choose between this and Ni-Ji, but I would not recommend people to go out of their way for it.  If they are conveniently in the area, then sure why not."}
{"text":"The best rolls I have ever had!!! Highly recommend the pressed aburi sushi!!! Will definitely come back to this restaurant!!!"}
{"text":"What I am most impressed about this place to be honest is the service! Been here twice and both times I was very, very impressed by the attentiveness of the server. The sushi is really good - reasonably priced and unique rolls. But I have to admit the Korean hot dishes are a bit bland. Come here if you want good sushi and good service in Scarborough!"}
{"text":"New tastes, friendly service!  First of all, we love sushi. I love AYCE, High-end, classic Japanese, Fusion, take-out, eat-in, and everything in between.  RNB is interesting because it's different from all those places, but still incorporates a lot of my favourites tastes...  New & Different Rolls. The biggest difference is the Aburi Sushi, which is sushi torched to a \"medium rare\" level. You can definitely taste the smoked/grilled flavour. The texture is still pretty \"sushi-ish\" but might be a good starting point for people who are new to sushi, since it looks cooked. Salmon had a nice kick of jalapeno on top, but like other reviews here, I'd prefer even more... I did not like the roe mixed into the rice since you don't get the flavour explosions...still most salmon sushi does not even include roe, so I'll take it. We're not big fans of spicy mayo, but I didn't find RnB's offensive.  We also got the Kalbi roll, another original roll. We both found it interesting, but the steak means it takes longer to eat it. Not sure I would order it again, but was an interesting mash-up of 2 of my favourite asian foods.  The Usual Suspects. We ordered Unagi (eel), spicy salmon, and a Legend Dynamite Roll as well. The unagi was not the tastiest, nor did I find they put enough unagi in the roll -- a bit disappointing. Spicy Salmon was pretty solid, but nothing special. The LD Roll was quite good. All the flavours were popping, and the shrimp tempura was still crunchy and warm inside the roll.   Overall, the flavours and freshness of the food are worth checking out!"}
{"text":"Holiday pricing was in effect and it was only Sunday, December 17th. We had to add a $3 extra charge to our lunch bento box take out orders: Bento E - Tempura, Chicken Teriyaki, 3pcs sushi, 5pcs roll, side dish ($12.95 + $3.00) Bento F - Tempura, Salmon Teriyaki, 3pcs salmon sashimi, 3pcs sushi, 5pcs roll, side dish. ($14.95 + $3.00)  For both of these bento boxes, the 5 rolls were California, and the tempura was 2 shrimp and the rest were sweet potatoe and a broccoli.  The miso soup did not have any tofu pieces.   The side dish was these cold slippery translucent yellow noodles. They weren't very appetizing.  This place is also very tiny inside, but I'm not judging them based on that.   This wasn't worth it for the price we paid. California rolls and Sweet Potatoe/Yam tempura??... Why should we have to pay holiday pricing for takeout?"}
{"text":"The name of this sushi restaurant says it all: the place only sells rolls and 'bowls' like udon, don, and Korean dishes. They also have appetizers but no sashimi or sushi (except for aburi sushi).  I think coming here with high hopes is what made me give them 3 stars. The rolls were good but not as amazing as I anticipated. There weren't too many special rolls but we ended up ordering the following   spicy scallop PEI roll - the roll is filled with lobster along with your typical roll toppings, and is topped with spicy scallop. Rice was fresh and soft with perfect amount of vinegar, but the roll itself was slightly bland. Spicy scallop could have been fresher too. I would rate this roll a 3/5.  Fantastic roll - heard great things about this roll so ordered it and really liked it. The sauce on top made with Japanese mayo really enhanced the flavours of the roll. Shrimp tempura inside as well. They topped it off with a slice of cherry tomato, which gave the roll a fragrant taste. 4/5 because slightly heavy.  Spicy salmon aburi sushi - nothing special but the blend of fish roe, salmon and sauce was well balanced. 3.5/5  Spice salmon pizza - Delicious! Rice base was fried but not oily. Good amount of crisp. Toppings were piled high and the mango sauce they drizzled was sweet and savoury, very good! 4/5 as when it gets cold the base is a tad bit too crispy and hard.  Beef bibimbap - great flavours. Soft rice but mixed well with the egg, bean sprouts, and beef. Beef was well seasoned. Adding the spicy sauce completed the dish. 4/5  Soft shell crab app - good flavouring in batter and very fresh soft shell. Comes with tempura yam. The batter here got hard really early so that made it lose a few points. 3/5   Overall great staff and customer service, food was good but not the best I've ever had. Worth a try!"}
{"text":"This is a great place.  Bang for your buck.  The tune and butter fish was seared.  The sweet potato rolls that came with the lunch bento boxes had a hint of cinnamon. Delicious!"}
{"text":"Came here on the first snowstorm of 2017 so it wasn't busy at all so I'm not sure how busy it gets during prime dinner time hours.   I ordered the soon tofu after falling in love with eating it and it turned out pretty good here! Spice levels were perfect and tofu was plentiful but more meats would have been nice. The bowl of rice provided was cooked okay - a bit dry but thankfully the soup helped.   It came with plenty of appetizers such as the usual bean sprout/lettuce/potato along with a cute little bowl of noodles and soup."}
{"text":"Late night Bibimbap!!kitchen area is clean and the food is amazeballs!!! Staff are happy and friendly!"}
{"text":"Was here April 7th, 2017.  I believe this was there grand opening day.    Came here because Niji Sushi across the street was packed full and lots of people waiting for table.    Service here was attentive as should be because of grand opening.   But it did look like they were having issues which is normal for opening day.     Portions here were smaller compared to Niji.   Quality and price is about the same.    But you get more at Niji and more varierty,   for example they usually give miso soup and green salad with your lunch or dinner even if it's NOT included in the set.    You can learn something here Bob's sushi.  Soup and salad costs you .50 cents at most.   At Niji when you order sashimi  they almost always give 4 pieces instead of the usual 3 piece of fish for each variety you order.  Will be tough to compete with Niji like this.   Also I ordered the grilled calamari on skillet, people do yourself a favor do not order this.  Worst calamari ever.   Not worth the $7.95 at all.  No grill marks, no grill flavor.  Looks like frozen calamari taken out of freezer and then defrosted in microwave then cooked in pan with butter. Sashimi here is also cut smaller compared to Niji.   If you can improve and be competitive you may stand a chance."}
{"text":"My first experience with Roll N Bowl was two nights ago. My brother brought me home a Fantastic Roll. They wrote \"Fantastic Roll\" on the styrofoam box and added a smiley face. It was quite cute. I think they may have torched it in the box, as there was a very large piece of tinfoil encasing the entire roll. While I appreciated the smokiness from the torching, I couldn't appreciate the fish in its entirety because there was too much sauce.  My second experience at Roll N Bowl was last night. I actually went to the restaurant.  They started us each off with a small bowl of complimentary noodles in soup. Usually, this broth tastes like miso or dashi. This one tasted like frozen veggies. Huh. My brother had mentioned he preferred the Rainbow Dragon Roll to the Fantastic Roll, so I got that last night. Once again, there was too much sauce. I expect this much sauce at all-you-can-eat places to mask up the lack of fish or poor quality of fish, but if the quality is good here, then why so much sauce? For the price they're charging for their torched rolls, I've had much better rolls elsewhere. I'm not saying this one wasn't any good. It was alright. I was expecting more though.  On to service. For a table of four, we had two tissues. We asked for more. They forgot to bring them. They didn't bring us tea until 20 minutes after we had been seated, and only because we asked them to. At some point, I was trying to reach a waiter. He acknowledged me, then did a whole bunch of things before I tried to get his attention again. For a restaurant that size and crammed fuller of tables than comfortable, they really need more servers. When we ordered, they kindly asked if we wanted to split bills. We said yes. When we got our bill, it was just that. A single bill. We had to ask for them to split it again. The food's alright, but the service could be so much better. It's not that the servers are intentionally rude. They're just super busy and understaffed."}
{"text":"Tried this place after passing by it a few times. I usually go to Niji and was a bit hesitant on giving this place a try until I read some reviews here.   We had the fantastic roll and the sashimi don. They started with noodles in soup which was complimentary. They then proceeded to provide us with miso soup and salad. The salad was good but the miso definitely needed some work.   The fantastic roll was delicious. I usually am not a fan of grape tomatoes but this was amazing. We each had the sashimi don and I'll admit the portion was large enough where we had to pack home a large amount.   Overall, the price for this place was decent and the menu definitely covers things that Niji doesn't have. I'll be returning to try more things on the menu! (It also helps that they're open on Sundays as Niji isn't.)"}
{"text":"Roll N Bowl creates a lot of different sushi rolls and combinations that I have not seen in other sushi restaurants yet and they tasted lovely! The restaurant itself it quite small so it might be hard to book huge tables. My favourite was the lobster roll that they had which was lobster sashimi rather than cooked lobsters at other places. They gave a generous amount of lobster and it was very sweet and fresh!"}
{"text":"First time customer, the best roll i've ever had in town so far.  good service as well. A place you have to go."}
{"text":"New sushi joint in Scarborough with aburi and pressed sushi? Yes! Sign me up!   With aburi style sushi and pressed sushi being such a rarity in Scarborough, I just had to try out Roll N Bowl, and can say that the stuff is good here!  We started with the spicy salmon wakame salad and really enjoyed it. It's essentially spicy salmon on seaweed salad and lettuce, with a citrus based vinegrette. Everything worked wonderfully.   The pressed sushi was also excellent - I went with the beef here and the beef was tender and was melt in your mouth (all of their aburi sushi were). There's quite a bit of spicy mayo and I wished the jalapeno came through a bit more, but it was still excellent.  We went with the fantastic, white dragon, and legend dynamite special rolls here and I was really impressed with the fantastic and white dragon. I think it was the garlic mayo sauce which was so creamy and just brings together everything so well. I also thought the cherry tomatoes on the fantastic roll was interesting. The legend dynamite didn't do anything for me. Again, I wish I could taste the jalapeno. I would say the inside of the rolls were fairly standard (i.e. California/dynamite) but at least all the fillings were fresh!  Service was friendly and you get a cool stamp card at the end of your meal (thanks for rewarding returning customers!) Overall, I was impressed with roll n bowl and it's definitely a welcome addition to the Scarborough sushi scene."}
{"text":"What a good start up. Gives us a choice as we live in the neighbourhood. They have such good service and the food is daily good. I did expect thinner slices for the korean pork. But everything else was great. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"On a late pass through Scarborough, I cracked open the Yelp app (who can live without it?) to get a lay of the land.  Roll N Bowl was along my path, so I stopped in.  The place is small and cozy, and the food was good.  I tried my usual test case of sushi and sashimi.  The fish was fresh, with good texture.  Prices are pretty nominal, so you really can't go wrong as far as I can tell.  It's on my list for next time I'm in the area.  I'll probably go in a bit heavier and see how they do on the more complex meals."}
{"text":"This is quickly becoming a favourite spot for our work lunches! The tempura/salmon terriyaki/sashimi bento box (Bento F I believe) is delicious and very generous portions. I like that they blend Korean and Japanese side dishes, including mini tempura soups and japchae.   The service can be a bit slow depending on the day but overall the staff are very friendly and the interior is nice and clean."}
{"text":"THIS IS THE BEST SUSHI PLACE IN SCARBOROUGH!! Amazing service and presentation. My only con is the prices are very high. You can tell the chef takes pride in his/her food. The quality is there and it is much better than the place I used to go across the street. I wish they offered bento boxes for dinner though because I love how bento boxes have a variety of things in them."}
{"text":"A new Japanese/ Korean restaurant that's been opened approximately 2 months Roll n Bowl is making some Culinary news!  Don't write-off Scarborough yet because this place is a great addition to the neighborhood. The service was superb, the food was presentable, quality was excellent and their prices were very reasonable. Coming here for a second time; first with Cris and second with Jen, the notable dishes we had were as follows:  **Fantastic Roll- Shrimp tempura, kappa, avocado roll with torched tuna tomato masago with garlic mayo...was this dish a favorite for me. No surprise its called Fantastic lol. **Crazy Boy Roll- Fried California roll, gigantic sized and full of flavor with a slight crunch.;)  **Chicken Katsu Don- Served on a bed of rice, topped off with some veggies with sliced panko fried chicken cutlet.  **Legend Kalbi - Topped off w/ Kimchi, mozzarella, banana peppers and kalbi this roll was a-okay.  **Tuna Pressed Sushi- wow! was this a great dish, beautifully presented.  Simply blissful.  **SOS Roll - was among my favorite aside from Fantastic, Torched spicy scallop with a kick of spice! both Jen and I agreed this was the best one.  In terms of food, quality, presentation, service and overall ambiance this place is a hidden gem and a great addition to Scarborough.  Ni Jin Japanese restaurant across the street has some fierce competition."}
{"text":"Love this place. This is my go to when I'm in Scarborough craving Korean/Japanese food. The menu has a good variety and the service is always wonderful."}
{"text":"First time eating here and we were overall impressed. The rolls we got were very unique, never had the same ones anywhere else. Fantastic Roll and White Dragon Roll tasted great and I will definitely order them again. The Tuna Pressed Aburi Sushi was good as well but probably will not order again (will try the beef next time).   The service was great and everyone was very friendly and welcoming. We were served a little noodle soup as an appetizer that was surprisingly good as well. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"This is the second time coming to this restaurant to eat first time was at lunch and this time I had dinner. The pressed sushi was disappointing it was a mountain of rice with barely any salmon on top.   We also got the Red Dragon Roll and spicy scallop dynamite roll which were both great.   Sushi was very fresh and service was timely. There's wasn't that many people eating dinner when we went. But quality and freshness were good.  Worth coming back. Maybe just don't get the pressed sushi unless you want to eat a block of rice."}
{"text":"We came here on a Thursday night, and the place was packed. Luckily, we got a seat right away. After hearing so many rave reviews about the \"Fantastic Roll\" we quickly decided to order it, along with the \"Summer Dragon\" & \"Crazy Boy\". The Fantastic Roll wasn't really as amazing as we thought it would be, the roll came out a little drenched in mayo sauce, and the tomato on it just felt odd. But the other two rolls were absolutely amazing.   The new idea of sushi being fried is just brilliant. As other tables came and go, there was so many new things that we wanted to try for next time. Service was also terrific. They gave us complimentary little taco shelled torched tuna & sliced oranges as dessert."}
{"text":"I came here with friends during dinner hours and this place is not busy. There's only 1 table sitting. Also on the receipt it appears to be a different name of the restaurant as it's advertised on yelp.   The food is decent, but very average. Sushi here are expensive- more than the sushi I paid at most downtown sushi restaurants.   Service is good, the girl is very attentive, but it might just be the fact that me and my friend were the only people there other than 1 other table there.   3/5 in total should be a fair assessment."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I ended up here because Niji was closed lol. But what a pleasant change of plans! Roll N Bowl is very similar to Niji in terms of their sushi and bento box options but they also have Korean food for those that aren't a fan of Japanese food. Prices are good, especially the bento boxes at lunch (12-3). The service is fast and super, super friendly. The restaurant is a little on the small side, though. It would be hard to get a table for bigger groups during their busy hours. I went on a Sunday evening and it was pretty full. But overall, a great spot!"}
{"text":"K9 spicy chicken stir fry: Pro - Good portion of meat Con - Just spicy and no flavour  Service: Pro -  Con - we were ignored after being sat down, waited for a good 15 minutes before they realized that they had customers to serve   +1 big seats/table"}
{"text":"We shouldn't have ordered \" family for two\" $41 It was our fire time experience.  They served us frozen shrimp shiumai for appetizer.  Teriyaki beef was okay. We finished. They displayed Sushi and sashimi beautifully,  but not fresh at all.  We couldn't eat white weird sashimi, because it smelled like a tilapia.  So we paid $49 ( include tips)  for frozen shiumai, and 9 pcs of sushi, 5 pcs of maki, and 10 pcs of teriyaki beef... Just don't order family for two here. I usually don't write review here, but this restaurant made me really unhappy. So I wanted to share my experience to make my feel better. Thank."}
{"text":"Best sushi in Midland Park. Much better than Niji across the street (only went once since the fire incident) Have been waiting for a very long time for a good sushi spot and it has finally arrived! Food is actually flavourful and well thought out. Customer service was amazing as well! This will be our go to sushi spot in Midland Park :)   Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"An excellent sushi spot in Scarborough! Very well maintained, great decor and atmosphere. The staff is very pleasant and helpful with the menu. The menu has a great selection of appetizers, a la cart rolls, bento boxes, soups and lunch specials.   The service was fast and the food tasted great. Everything was prepared well and presented beautifully. The quality of the ingredients was excellent and the portion sizes were large.   I'd recommend the seared salmon sushi roll and the deep fried tuna roll. The noodle soup appetizer was also delicious.   I will defiantly go back."}
{"text":"I quite enjoyed my experience at Roll N Bowl. It's located at the southeast corner of Midland and Ellesmere. It's more expensive than Ni Ji across the road but I liked it way more as you can see from my review of Ni Ji (though the fish there was pretty fresh).  I have a feeling this place is called Roll N Bowl because they sell rolls (Japanese food) and bowls (Korean food) as it is Korean-run. I believe meals come with soup and salad. Service was really friendly and the ladies who served us were going around giving free Korean side dishes to everyone as there was a bit of a wait for the food. I found that quite a considerate thing to do - and also good damage control as well as hangry customers are not happy ones!  We ordered takoyaki as a side dish first and it was all right - nothing amazing but not a bad snack. We ordered two rolls as well - a black dragon roll, a fantastic roll, and a rainbow dragon roll.  The fantastic roll has torched tuna, tomato, and garlic sauce which I think is quite unique though it didn't taste quite as fantastic as I thought it would be and the garlic sauce was not very distinct. I think the snow valley roll at Nichiban Sushi4U does it a bit better - they also have torched tuna with garlic sauce. The rainbow roll has torched fish on top unlike other places where it's raw and it was quite good! Everything tasted fresh - not much more to say.  Strangely enough I liked the black dragon roll the most - again the ingredients were very fresh. I think personally I don't like having too many sauces on my rolls which the other two rolls did have a lot of sauce ( I scraped it off). This roll comparatively is quite light though the portion is still really big! Even though these rolls are more expensive they don't skimp on portions which I think is nice.  Overall a good experience and if I'm in the area I'd be back again."}
{"text":"Came in for a lunch on a snowy day and ordered GamJaTang and SoonDuBu.  I know it's not a restaurant only serving Korean food but the owners were Korean so we figured it would be safe to order Korean items on the menu.    All in all, the food was average.  My GamJaTang was a little bland without too much spice.  The pork bones were cooked well but still smelled and tasted \"porky\".  The portion size is good but I'm not sure this would be my go to place for GamJaTang cravings.  The SoonDuBu was also ok but on the saltier side compared to the blandness of their GamJaTang.    The sides, including kimchi, were good enough to accompany a very average meal.  We were seated right by their sashimi fridge and it didn't look like there were more than 3 kinds of fish (salmon, butterfish and tuna).  It didn't exactly make me want to try their roll offerings but maybe if I'm in the area again, I'd venture in for a quick bite."}
{"text":"They gave us free dumplings for delays. Love the pressed sushi with tuna is a must try"}
{"text":"Everything was fresh and tasted good except for the udon. The sauce taste funny and bland. They're very friendly. My new fav sushi place in Scarborough!"}
{"text":"The noodles I had felt like instant noodles but the sushi was ok not bad at all there in anything that you could pick in the Japanese stuff. Next time I should try on the more Korean food there because the people who serve there are more specialized in Korean food. With the price it is very reasonable I think. Spending at least $20. I give a pass for now of 2.5 out of 5."}
{"text":"Well found out they were closed on Tuesdays.....haha but anyways the food was very good and the portions were more than filling. I had the ramen beef and a couple rolls of sushi (can't remember the names), but my Co worker almost had to take me out in a wheelchair that's how full I was. Staff was very friendly. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner after seeing the reviews on yelp, and I leave a very satisfied customer.  We ordered two rolls and a spicy bulgogi. Portions are decent (the two of us could not finish it all) and the service is friendly. It's a new place so you can certainly see that they put care into the preparations.  I would say the spicy bulgogi was not spicy at all (I have very low spice tolerance) but the flavor was good.  All in all, it's a decent little find. I hope they do well."}
{"text":"I went here with my family last weekend and the food was great as well as the staff there, they were really polite. I definitely will come again!!"}
{"text":"Very friendly staff. We waited 10 mins for our table, but they apologized and was very polite. We ordered the seafood udon $10.95 + $3 for the spicy salmon maki, salmon teriyaki $15.95 , chicken karaage ($6). It came with soup and salad. The udon was a really big bowl with lots of seafood. Salmon teriyaki was very good. The chicken karaage was like a chicken katsu, very crispy. Overall, we will come back again."}
{"text":"Based on their recommendations, their specialty is pressed / aburi sushi and specialty rolls. The menu of their specialty rolls seem to be smaller compared to other restaurants. They provide complimentary home made miso soup. The miso soup contains some wheat noodles, which makes the soup more interesting. Rainbow Dragon is colorful and had great texture. If you were able to stuff the entire piece into your mouth at once, you will be able to experience that full of complex flavors because it is slightly torched and added spicy sauce. The taste of Shrimp Lover roll had a great smell because it is baked and the dried shrimps on top. For the texture, it is still complex and interesting because of the tiny dried shrimps that gives a little bit of a crunch. Taste it is simple compared to other ones added with spicy sauce, but then you can actually get to taste the natural sweetness of the shrimps.  In my opinion, this roll is already great, but it would be perfect if it is actually loaded with those tiny dried shrimps instead of just a sprinkle of them.  The overall service is very friendly, restaurant is clean and the layout simple but comfortable. As they noticed that it's our first time, they are kind enough to give us a discount of the bill. The price value compared to quality-quantity-presentation rating overall is fair."}
{"text":"I would come back for their special rolls. They are full of flavours and fulfilling. And they offer more variety of sashimi which is a key point to me."}
{"text":"Great and cozy place! Decent price and high quality food: both soups and sushi rolls. Perfect place especially in Scarborough location! Liked it!"}
{"text":"Just got the pressed beef here for take out. I had it dine in last week and pieces of beef were thick and medium rare perfect. Today I got take out and the pieces were PAPER THIN for over 13.99 what a joke pure rice. NEVER coming back here again and you guys shouldn't either."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I just had dinner here and want to review this place immediately! The overall food and service was very satisfying. This restaurant opened 3 weeks ago and to our surprise, there was a heavy flow of customers throughout the night and many take out orders. It's clean, bright and seats about 35 people. They are currently doing a 15% discount upon your next visit and even offered us a stamp card.  Before the appetizer and entrees arrived, they served us tempura soup with noodles. This was a pleasant variation from the usual miso soup. We ordered four different things on the menu. The deep fried gyoza (5 pieces) was crispy and basically what we expected it to be. The inside of the Fantastic roll (9 pieces) had shrimp tempura, cucumber, avocado and tobiko, topped with slightly torched tuna and cherry tomatos, and drizzled with garlic mayo. The combination of ingredients, textures and flavours was truly fantastic :) For those who aren't a garlic fan, the garlic mayo wasn't strong and didn't leave any after taste. We also ordered the tuna pressed aburi sushi (6 pieces)- another great choice. Fish roe was found between the rice, the tuna was seared, and a slice of jalapeño and spicy mayo was layered on top. The level of spiciness was perfect and again, everything tasted so well together! I would prefer less rice for this sushi but this didn't take away from the taste itself. Not many Korean/Japanese restaurants offer torched sushi so kudos to Roll N Bowl for offering this on their menu! Finally, we ordered the beef don- grilled strip loin steak and egg on rice. We didn't find this one special and tasted average.   For the amount and variety of food we ordered, the price was very reasonable. We finished everything and had to pack half the bowl of beef don. We are already looking forward to returning and trying more of their menu! I have a few of their special rolls in mind, as well as their Korean entrees and albab! Not many places make albab (fish roe rice on hot stone bowl) so it's mandatory I try next time!"}
{"text":"A decent place for Japanese/korean food. However when there's a 4* on yelp I would expect this place to somewhat impress me, and it sadly didn't.   3* service Let's start off with the service. The service was prompt but the waiter didn't show much enthusiasm in serving the customers. Never asked us how we're doing or how the food is. I do have to give him credit for filling our water promptly.   3.5* food Firstly, we got the aburi salmon pressed sushi (11.99). Out of all the rolls, I think this was the best. It is topped with torched salmon which gives you the buttery soft taste and texture when you eat it. A plus is that there's also salmon in the middle of the roll that gives you a second surprise.   The other rolls we got were SOS, dragon roll and spicy salmon. These rolls were 12.99, 15.99, and 6.99 respectively. Given the price, I would expect a lot more surprises with the flavours and taste. Unfortunately they tasted like any other all you can eat places out there.  If I'm in the area I would probably eat here again, but I wouldn't go out of my way to come here."}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite places to dine in for sushi if I don't plan to eat AYCE. We entered with warm greetings and received the menu with a variety of options. It is reasonably priced and somewhat similar to NIJI'S prices and menu options, which is also favourite. As we waited for our food, we were served a little bowl of soup with noodles, miso soup and a complimentary bowl of japchae (glass noodles). A salad was also served with the bento box. I ordered a salmon bento box which included filled with 3 pieces of sashimi, 3 salmon sushi, salmon teriyaki on top of sautéed vegetables, 4 pieces of a California roll and a variety of tempura (shrimp, sweet potato, broccoli, squash). We also ordered spicy chicken bibimbap filled with multiple toppings (carrots, mushroom, zucchini, & etc), topped with egg. Overall we had great service and to top it off, they have a stamp card that you can bring every time you eat there to receive any free appetizer !"}
{"text":"A nice place that has a good variety of Japanese and Korean dishes.  Friendly service and comfortable seatings.   Came here last Saturday evening and although the place was not packed, it was comfortably busy throughout the 2 hours that we were there.  The complimentary Korean dishes \"banchan\" were good especially the kimchi.  I think that they forgot to bring us the complimentary salads and crunchy noodles soup which I see others have posted.  We got a few dishes to share for 4 of us which included the 2 Korean dishes (Soon Tofu, Bulgogi), Fantastic Roll and Salmon Aburi sushi. The rolls/sushi were okay but we did enjoy the Korean dishes more especially the Soon Tofu.  This is a Korean stew with soft tofu, veggies and your choice of seafood or beef.  It came out bubbling hot with a raw egg that was just added before serving.  This is one of those Korean comfort food that is so good especially over steam rice.  I've had better but it was still nicely done."}
{"text":"Went for lunch on a Sunday and by 1:00, the place was almost full. I noticed they do a great deal of take out service as well.   This is a great little place, located in a small plaza in Scarborough at Midland and Ellesmere. The prices are very reasonable, portions large, food very good, and the service, outstanding. Our server, Alex could not have been more friendly and accommodating. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Roll N Bowl appears to be a small family-run restaurant, and on my visit, I'd say I was a bit disappointed given all the good reviews I've seen.   The service wasn't terrible, but wasn't that great either. The waiter didn't seem to know what he was doing half the time. Also, no complimentary dessert here as is common practice at most Japanese restaurants of this type.  The food itself was hit-or-miss. The shrimp yaki udon had lots of shrimp, but was extremely salty (caution to anyone that's trying to keep their sodium intake in check). The aburi (pressed) sushi wasn't \"pressed\" that well, in the sense that it would often fall apart when picked up with chopsticks. The fantastic roll was pretty fantastic, though initial impressions from the presentation weren't that great since it was covered in gooey sauce.  All in all, there's a lot of room for improvement! Hopefully after a few months I can revise this review."}
{"text":"Pretty good food, both Japanese and Korean. Our family had the seafood udon, beef bibimbap, white dragon roll, and gamjatang (pork bone soup). All around big portions and good flavours. Personally, I had the beef bibimbap and there were generous portions of zucchini, mushrooms, beef, carrots, cucumber, and one egg, sunny-side. The beef and mushrooms were marinated in a really good bulgogi sauce, and that added to the dish because the worst thing that could have happened was a very bland bibimbap. I had a bit of the pork bone soup and the pork was very tender; fell right off the bone, and the soup had a nice balance of spicy and savoury. The whole family thinks that the food is pretty good quality for the price we're paying. Would come again to try more sushi!"}
{"text":"3.5 is my rating.  I'm usually the omakase sushi kind of girl, but once in a while I crave some fancy saucy rolls. On average their rolls are $11+.  Tuna Pressed Aburi Sushi ($11.95 for 6 pieces) Pressed sushi topped with tuna, spicy mayo, and a slice of jalapeno torched. This was decent, pretty tasty but felt like it was missing something. I just wished you could mix and match on your selection of fish and not fixed to just one kind.  White Dragon Roll ($13.95 for 9 pieces) Torched tilapia on dynamite roll with garlic mayo. This roll was tasty, probably because it was really saucy. Strong in garlic taste.  Fantastic Roll ($13.95 for 9 pieces) Shrimp tempura with avocado roll with torched tuna tomato masago with garlic mayo. This was okay, thought it could have used bigger pieces of tuna instead of diced pieces at placed on top of the roll. I didn't find the tomato complimenting the roll at all."}
{"text":"Overall, I think Roll N Bowl is very average with decent food and friendly service. The restaurant falls short in that it doesn't nail either the Korean or the Japanese cuisine it offers. The dynamite roll I ordered, although good, fell apart easily while picking up. As for the Korean food, the bibimbap wasn't anything memorable, while the side dishes were okay with the kimchi needing a bit of work. I would go again, but I would prefer the competitor across the street if I wanted to eat a similar cuisine.  Also, I went during a busy dinner service where the restaurant was packed. The service was a bit slow at times, but nonetheless still okay. Roll N Bowl would definitely benefit from hiring an extra waiter."}
{"text":"Not so impressed with Roll N Bowl! The place isn't too big, very authentic, with Japanese music in the background. They have a good decent menu with lots of options, I order a Shrimp Tempura appetizer along with Shrimp Tempura role and California roll. The service was pretty quick, and I received my order right away, there were only three other tables/customers.  The shrimp tempura is great, crispy, fried to perfection, large pieces. The rolls is what I have a problem, first of all presentation isn't on point, where you're usually used to piece of Art at sushi places. It looked like a big pile of rolls. Portions are big, but some of the rolls were falling apart already sitting on the plate. The rice shell was un-even, you get pieces with barely any versus some that are clogged with rice!  Taste isn't great, way below average, and whatever sauces they used did not match.  I would not repeat this place"}
{"text":"Japanese or Korean or both!  Roll N Bowl is a good restaurant to have dinner with indecisive dinner mates as I think everyone would find something they enjoy in their menu.  I was here for lunch and dinner.   Their signature is quite good but just little over sauced for my taste. And sometimes their rolls can be sloppy prepared.   Bulgogi was flavourable and the meat was of decent cut. It will make any meat lover happy.  Not a bad option if you are in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Everything I've had here is good.  The best is their Fire Roll!!!!!!!!! It's fire  I love that they offer delivery and they are inexpensive!"}
{"text":"Really great spot in Scarborough. Their aburi sushi was very good and prices are also reasonable. What stood out exceptionally though was the service. Fast, efficient, accurate, and just a really positive attitude to customers. It's small touches from the staff that makes the experience really enjoyable. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Great selection of speciality rolls. Very friendly staff. Thoroughly enjoyed my few visits here!"}
{"text":"This place was ok, portions were very generous and great for Korean food, but Japanese food was just alright. Customer service however was very good.  We had the Sashimi Don but my husband found the spicy sauce pairing not as good with the salad and sashimi. As well, my husband had a stomache ache right after eating their Sashimi don, and even though it said it came with rice, they only gave the sashimi on salad. The roll was also mediocre. However, the bulgogi was a very generous portion and tasty though. I would definitely order the Korean food next time, but the price isn't incredibly cheap either. You are definitely getting quantity though at this place."}
