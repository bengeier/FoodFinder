{"text":"All of their lunch/dinner specials are great! Very reasonable and the owners are absolutely awesome! It's a pleasant experience everytime I visit."}
{"text":"Came in thinking I was going to have a pleasant experience. Wrong! Cashier was rude, and the chips I bought ended up being expired. For a small place with literally no inventory, you would think that there would be no confusion. Hmm..."}
{"text":"An incredibly welcoming one-stop shop for anything you need!  Whether you're short some ice for a summer barbecue, to being in need of some serious help with your menu for hosting a gathering, Mt. Vernon Dairy has it all.  Run by an amazing family, the Dairy is perfect for anything you might need and need quick.  Never will I not stop by, when I'm in the area.  Highly recommended!! (Personally love all the holiday desserts, yum!)"}
