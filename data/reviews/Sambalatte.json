{"text":"Does not open until 7am??? You serve breakfast/coffee on one of the busiest intersections in Vegas and you don't open until 7am?  Rediculous!"}
{"text":"I had a half caff 12 ounce latte. It had a very nice rosetta on it and tasted like a milky latte, not exceptional and also not bad. I love their red ceramic cups that they use \"for here\". The feel of the place reminds me of Starbucks in terms of layout and the fact that the baristas are wearing headsets... that just totally changes the vibe of a place for me, it feels more plastic and less genuine. It was a very business like and efficient transaction. If you are looking for an indie coffee shop with soul, this isn't your place."}
{"text":"Favorite coffee spot. Wish they had more locations with drive-thru's. Best coffee I've had, makes Starbucks look like a chump."}
{"text":"Love the Nutella cappuccino and the fact that this location has a drive thru which is fairly quick, however I requested a breakfast sandwich without meat for which they stated they could not change the price. This here is an $8 sandwich. Never again."}
{"text":"Although this location doesn't carry the same charm as the one in Boca Park, I find it more welcoming, comfortable, and convenient.  It's located on Jones just off of the 215 next to Tropical Smoothie and near Sierra Gold/Kyara. Small inside but ample outdoor seating with shade. Working drive through for those on the go.   Baristas here are awesome and are very consistent. I've had my drinks taste very milky at the other location but here, my drinks have been a perfect balance between coffee and milk. I always opt for the nutella latte, nutella cappucino, or chocolate cappucino with almond milk. Heads up, their shots of espresso \"are large enough that they count as two\"-according to the baristas. No tall, grande, ventis here-size availabilities are 12 oz for hot drinks and 12 oz or 16 oz for the iced lattes.   If you get one of their cards, after 15 drinks, your next is free. My only complaint is that your tab can rack up here. Their drinks and pastries get pretty pricey."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in my two visits to this location.  Premium prices (almost 5 bucks for a 12 oz. coffee) demand excellent service and a premium experience.  That is sadly not the case here.  The staff did not want to make one of the specialty coffees because it would take longer than just pouring a cup out of the big urn of house coffee.  Also, did not go through the effort to select a full size piece of biscotti.  I got a 3/4 size fragment at full price.  This order took more than 20 minutes to complete.  Another note: the to go cups they use impart an unpleasant taste an odor to the coffee.  Philosophically, I do not buy in to this new trend of complicated ways to make premium coffee.  I am also weary of lazy staff that will be untruthful about how long an urn of coffee has been sitting there.  A simple pour over with premium beans, fully roasted, clean water at the proper temperature is all that is required.    That said,  I have had better experiences at the Summerlin location, despite my old school biases."}
{"text":"I have been coming to Sambalatte for about 3 years now. The morning baristas are very knowledgeable and really know their craft! I highly recommend this place if you want an awesome latte! Definitely try out the Nutella latte and the Red Rock latte."}
{"text":"The specialty coffees are good but overpriced. Lackluster pastries and blaring soundtrack make this just an average cafe."}
{"text":"I love their cappuccinos and those definitely deserve the 5 stars.   But I am REALLY bummed they close at 7pm. This isn't Summerlin where everything closes down early. The same complex has two 24hr businesses and a restaurant that closes at 2-3am. 10 people just had to leave and more were coming in because they said they close at 7. They don't have to stay open until 2am (though I'd love it) but at least until 9 or 10pm like most other things in this area. Even Starbucks stays open that late one block away.   I've been waiting for months for this location to open and it's great, I just hope they change their mind on their hours!"}
{"text":"Great spot. Great coffee. The only thing that could make Sambalatte better is if there were a Henderson location. :-d"}
{"text":"The coffee and everything is good. They don't have a very large breakfast/ lunch selection, Starbucks beats it when it comes to that...."}
{"text":"I just love this coffe spot. Best cappuccino and coffe art. I tell all my friends and they all agree there are not other places like Sambalatte. And yes you get a free coffe after 10 times."}
{"text":"Sambalatte blows starbucks out of the water! Amazing, flavorful, QUALITY drinks and food. I go to the Jones location once or twice a day. A bit more expensive than other places but worth the extra $2-$4."}
{"text":"i ordered nutella latte -- it was not as good as how they priced it -- $6+/12oz!!! totally not worth it! based on the taste i'd pay $2 for it! :( what a disappointment! but to be fair i ordered it with soy.  and to add to my disappointment the drive thru wait was longer than normal."}
{"text":"The coffee is great!!! Beats other chain stores!! A few unique drinks that I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Wish they had everything they have on their menu. Went there to get a quick breakfast at 8:50am, ordered their oatmeal, I was told they're out of, also ordered their peppermint tea, and was also told they're out."}
{"text":"Compared to the Summerlin location, this one's meh. The look of the place is very nice, I especially love the wood counter facing a view of the strip. The customer service is what seems to be a hit or miss here. The morning I went in, the ladies looked less than happy to be there, and the foam on my latte was a bit off, weak and a few bubbles.  I was thrilled at the thought of a replica of the Summerlin location coming to the South end of Vegas, but unfortunately when places expand, they often lose sight of their originality and all the important facets entailed in what makes an awesome caf√©. This is what has happened here. But it's not too late! Bottom line for this locale: hire better help, like the technical and friendly, passionate baristas you have in Summerlin, and given that this isn't in a ritzy neighborhood like Summerlin, they should adjust their prices accordingly, especially with the competition they have in the area with Coffee houses."}
{"text":"I love Latte here. So strong and thick. Little bit expensive but better than starbucks. Hopefully make some extra large size."}
{"text":"This is the best place for me to study. The shop is big and open. I don't like going to small place and full of people talking. Weekend is normal for here to be packed, but I usually come here on weekdays before or after school. They have outside tables that you can sit and chat with your big group of friends and enjoy the summer heat. Oh well you know fall in coming, enjoy the best weather in Vegas at this time of the year!  I love Nutella and their Iced Nutella latte is my favorite for summer coffee. I used to order Nutella cappuccino when the weather was colder. Oh don't forget to try matcha if you like milk greentea. They also have smoothies, and my fav here is Acai smoothie which is a Brazilian berry.   Desserts are good but a little pricy. If you like sweet, chocolate crunch is awesome.   The staffs here are awesome and friendly. When they are busy, it might be a little slow. But give them times. You don't come to a good coffee shop and rush to go somewhere. Come here and hang out. Have a good coffee with a great conversation with friends. Or put your headset on and study.   Too bad they close at 8pm, kinda too early for Vegas. I'm a night owl that I would love to stay till midnight or later."}
{"text":"I gave the Summerlin location 5 Stars. The Jones location just opened so I'm going to give it a few chances since I love the coffee. All the foods and drinks are great. I give those 5 Stars. My 3 Stars is because of the service and the price. I don't mind the $5 price for coffee but $8 for the ham and cheese croissant! Really?! The service is VERY slow at the moment. It's understandable IF it was busy and if they're under staffed, but there's 5 people behind the counter 3 people in the coffee section and 2 cashiers. I found myself waiting there to be acknowledged, finally someone took my order and my coffee took forever to be made. It's because the baristas are just socializing talking about their plans for the night! Really?! Come on! I can hear you and see what you're doing or NOT doing! Then I ask the cashier about how much some of the pastries are and they respond with an \"I don't know.\" At least have the employees know the prices of the small amount of pastries that they have at the top of their head! I'm going to give them a chance though because of the coffee! I really hope they get themselves together! I really want them to succeed and close at a later time! Closing at 7pm is ridiculous when there's Serenade close by that closes at 3am."}
{"text":"This is by far, the BEST coffee shop I have ever been to. I was so used to going to Starbucks every day, and having just mediocre lattes, but this coffee shop opened near my house and has drive-thru, so i thought i'd try it. I am hooked. I come here about three times a week. Their iced nutella latte is the best coffee drink ive ever had. Also their muffins are the size of boulders (and quite as dense as one). I have had the chocolate muffin and the blueberry muffin. They are so delicious. I have also tried the almond croissant. Incredible. I dont post on yelp alot but I felt I had to being how delicious this place is. I never go to Starbucks anymore. There really is no comparison. Seriously. Oh, and the staff is super nice also. it gets 5 stars from me easily. Try it. You wont be disappointed."}
{"text":"The coffee is great, but the prices are overly expensive (even for the clientele they cater to), and you do not get your moneys worth. They only offer 16 oz. drinks, and some drinks are only 12 oz. When asked for a 16 oz. drink, the sales person said, \"we will give it to you, but we will only add more milk, there will not be additional coffee.\" I am not sure that is the best, customer friendly approach.   I think I will stick with Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf. Coffee quality is the same, but at reasonable prices."}
{"text":"I have always enjoyed Sambalatte in Boca Park and am so elated that they opened their new location off Jones and 215S.  The decor is unique, great customer service and the outdoor seating is inviting. Their cafe lattes served in a real cup is my favorite.  Expensive? I don't think so as the prices are comparable to the mega chain coffee \"stores.\" The big difference--this is a local cafe, with local owners and not some big chain where all profits go to Seattle!"}
{"text":"Not as extravagant as the one in boca park but this location has a drive threw!!! Nevertheless this location is still relaxing and has the samba vibe when you walk inside.   For first timers this is nothing like the Starbucks of coffee bean you are use too.  The coffee and tea here is more authentic and there is more exotic flavors like a Nutella latte.      If you are a chai fan the chai latte is the best I have ever had.  It has more of a spice too it and you can taste the layers unlike other places where it is on consistent flavor"}
{"text":"I recommend there Chai Latte! I had them add in almond milk and it tasted amazing! The latte was so calming & perfect!  Definitely will be back again to try other drinks from there menu :) love that there is a drive thru as well. It is Very nice inside too!"}
{"text":"Yes, there's no doubt that the coffee is good but the pretentiousness of the place overall makes me never want to set foot in there again. From the cheesy music covers they play, to the uniforms the baristas wear, the constantly changing wifi password, and the overall bad service--not to mention how overpriced it is-- it's just not my scene. A veggie quiche is $8 but tiny and served with plastic silver wear. I go in with an open mind and leave generally annoyed. Go to Sunrise Coffee House for a legit local vibe, fair prices and great service."}
{"text":"This place offers good coffee and the lattes are yummy but the price is pretty steep and the vibe is really stiff.  You almost dont enjoy your latte like you should because of the stiff vibe.  The interior is decorated nice and there is plenty of seating.  This would get a 5 star if the pricing was better and/or the drinks were provided with a cheerful smile. What is a coffee shop without the comfort?"}
{"text":"Was hoping this location was like the one on rampart. But very disappointed with this location. The food/pastry choices are horrible. I walked in, all they had was butter croissants, muffins & doughnuts cut in half. I could get that at wal mart. I walked out and was not able to get anything unfortunately, since there is nothing to choose from. Rosalie cafe is better than this location. This location needs to step it up. They are slacking. Sad to believe."}
{"text":"I like this coffee shop mainly for the flat white.  It's in a convenient location, has friendly staff and qualify product.  I wish they were quicker at making the orders and clearing the tables."}
{"text":"Great diner-style breakfast place. Clean. Well-cooked eggs. Fluffy pancakes. Service is attentive and super-friendly. Will be my go-to spot when I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"Stay away!!!! This place will get you sick from spoiled milk in the latte!!! Wish I could leave zero stars."}
{"text":"If you've been to the original location, you'll be disappointed to find it's smaller with less seating. But there is plenty more outdoor seating in comparison.   The usual treats and drinks you crave from Sambalatte are still available here. And there's a kicker: a drive thru!!  Not sure if it's open or in use...only time will tell how well that will go."}
{"text":"I was excited to see a new coffee spot on this side of town, other than starbucks. It's a great place to come, lots of indoor and outdoor seating. They play great music, really mellow. Besides the great atmosphere, the drinks are great. I always get great recommendtions and try something different everytime. Cortado was wonderful, and strong. If you love green tea, try their matcha latte or you can even get it blended as just a frappe.   I've been here about 4-5 times already and recently noticed dog bowls with water, it would be great to bring your dog here.  A wonderful spot!"}
{"text":"Came here to study on a weekday and sip on some coffee.   Drinks were okay but the store was smaller than expected compared to the Summerlin location or even other coffee shops.  Couldn't concentrate at all because the music was too loud and ugly Also it was so hot I felt like taking off my clothes or leaving, so I went with the second option and just left without any work getting done and my time wasted.  Other than that I guess it's a nice place to hangout with friends if you're lucky enough to find a table...(of the 5 they have)"}
{"text":"I am so excited that Sambalatte has opened another location in my neighborhood! It's so close, almost too close because I don't think I will be able to stay away. I have visited the Boca Park location a few times and it's always very busy and loud. I really like that this new shop is quiet and you can just stop by and grab a quick drink. My favorite is the White Chocolate Mocha Latte and I have found a new love for their almond macarons. Delicious!"}
{"text":"I've only tried this place once and I'm not sure if I will ever go back again. I had to wait in line for maybe 10 to 15 minutes because it seemed the customer in front of us had either a complicated order or there was a mistake in the order.   This took so much time because the employees had to call someone in order to figure out how to fix the problem. I'm not sure how long this business has been open but in situations like these one would assume that there are contingencies in order to expedite the next client standing in line. This was in the middle of the week and in the middle afternoon. So, this was not rush hour and this was not right at opening or closing."}
{"text":"I really love the coffee here--the quality is one of the best in town I think. The staff have always been friendly whenever I'm here. My favorite drinks are the Rose Petal latte and the Red Rock latte. The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because they charge a $0.75 fee on orders that are \"for here.\""}
{"text":"Great staff, nice room, excellent iced chai latte!!  Thank you!"}
{"text":"I love this place!  They are legit barristas in this coffee shop.   I always get the Nutella Latte, because even with non-fat it's creamy and yummy and delicious.   Now because I read below in another review that I can get almond milk, I'm trying that next time.  The staff are so friendly, accomodating, fast and terrific.  I think their pastries are a tad over-priced but they specialize in gluten free, and organic which I never bother with really.  But for those with diatary needs I'm sure it's appreciated.  Oh!  And you must try the Lavender Latte.  OMG.  To die for.  Almost beats Nutella, but not quite."}
{"text":"Best coffee ever! If you haven't tried it..you are missing out. Try their bakeries too..it puts panera bread to a shame"}
{"text":"Love the location in Boca park, but this one is 'off\" for a few reasons.  1) Freezing inside, so you may opt for outside. But... 2) Proximity to freeway is not very soothing to listen to when outside.... 3) The outside area lies between two buildings under a structure, so you are essentially in a wind tunnel, requiring you pay close attention to those napkins. 4) I'm an average size, 180 lbs guy, but these weird chairs they put out by the large table are very 'narrow' Which would be fine if it was a flat surface. But instead the ' center' part sinks into a bowl, leaving you to rest your weight on the two metal tubes wrapped in some burlap sack textile. Now, to be fair, this was probably designed primarily to be a drive through version of Sambalatte, so the location and structure issues are set. But hopefully they can get some more comfortable chairs and turn the AC down a tad."}
{"text":"Sambalatte Cafe offers great Espresso atmosphere and friendly patron-oriented staff, however, music gets soo loud at times you have to walk outside into the parking lot to hear a telephone conversation.  As great as the Staff is, the Owner refuses hot water to be sold so tea can be enjoyed to the paying Patron's taste.  A great solution consideration would be to offer a secondary brand of tea such as the organic teas from www.mightyleaf.com Then again if the Owner made an effort to be more approachable and mingle with patrons he could see this for himself."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place. I sat at the drive through for 30 minutes and no one answered the speaker. I drove up the window. The girl in there looked at me and walked away... I was excited for some coffee.   I'm shocked by the poor service."}
{"text":"Service has gone down the drain at this location, it's getting worse and worse by the day. The attitude of the young people working there is very dismissive and they clearly don't care about customer service. The quality of food is very inconsistent and they don't seem to care about any of it. This used to be my favorite location to grab a nice smoothie on my way home after a long day at work, it's too bad I'm going to have to go elsewhere. I really hope new management comes in and fix all of the issues this location is having, it's a matter of time before they loose all of their customers..."}
{"text":"Great place to hang out with friends & loved ones for great cup of coffee n great pastries too....luv this place"}
{"text":"Real espresso macchiato ! Organic foods, nice coffee shop to get some work done, meet buddies over coffee or even read a book. Very friendly staff :-)"}
{"text":"I had tried this location three times, but the coffee flavor is better in the first. Nutella flavor is plain, the service is very slow."}
{"text":"Our family really enjoys this place. It's not the closest but worth a little travel. Good coffee and other items (pastries quiche drinks) consistently good. Nice staff. And not owned by a big corporation trying to foist political views on you."}
{"text":"My wife and I love everything about Sambalatte.  We were so excited when we found out they were opening a location in the southern side of the Valley; kind of bummed it wasn't in Henderson though.  But this location is awesome: quaint, retro, cozy; a great spot to go get a cup of coffee and just relax, especially in the winter months.  The nutella bomb is AMAZING and my wife had the dirty chai latte.  Afterwards she loved how her \"breath smelled like Christmas\" haha  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Fantastic Latte!  Great flavor, made just the way I like it in a fantastic atmosphere.  Please open one up on the east side of town (preferably next to my business!)"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and delicious coffee. Best part is the friendly staff. Individually owned so another good reason to support."}
{"text":"Came here on a tuesday to work on my laptop and read. Picked up a nutella latte. Much stronger than the matcha latte i had before. Weather was nice that day too so, as usual, opted to sit outside.   I wish their seats were more comfortable outside though. So straight and hard. (LOL..) Causing me to readjust my seating quite often. Aside from that, pretty good.   When i was there, seemed like there were two guys working on building a table top? I'm not sure if those two tables are for the area between Sambalatte and Tropical smoothie but they created quite a mess. Overflowed material was sprayed away onto the ground, making it difficult for some people to access Sambalatte from the side door.   Aside from that, good place to hang outside and away from sun :P"}
{"text":"Tons of  electrical outlets. Free WiFi. Good selection of drink, pastries, some food. Very good place if you need to squirrel away to get some work done on your laptop. Not quite \"cozy\" but definitely comfortable and quiet and mellow. Lots of outdoor seating in the shade, which in Vegas in May is perfect."}
{"text":"A bit pricey, but I think that's to be expected. Cool variety of drinks and snacks. Nice outdoor seating. The one thing I don't like is that if you choose to sit outdoors, your coffee will sit on the counter inside. It'd be kind of nice if someone could let you know that it's ready. By the time I grab mine, it's usually cold.   BUT maybe that's just not how coffee shops work. :-)"}
{"text":"Met a friend here for a coffee date and I liked it. The environment was friendly and welcoming. My only concern was it was hard to find the cashier and when my ham and cheese foldover was ready it was so greasy I had to get napkins twice to clean myself up! My latte was decent as well but the design lacked presentation. up. I guess I had high expectations since I'm a Starbucks addict but I would return for a friend if invited."}
{"text":"I usually  the coffee drinks here ~ I have had many mochas both frozen & iced ~however today I ordered a iced chai latte.......BLEH!!! Very ICKY!!!' I like my chai creamy & this is more spicy. I thought maybe I would adjust to it ALAS NOPE! Couldn't adjust, so that's a wasted $5.41, I'll live and now know NEVER to order chai here."}
{"text":"I came here with one of my friends and we were very impressed with the decor on the inside, it had a very cozy comfortable feel. Outside there was a nice seating area and they even had a couple dog water bowls, which I thought was pretty cool.   I wanted to try a hot drink so I could get the fun steamed milk art, but since it was so nice outside we both got an iced Nutella latte. I was a little disappointed. I couldn't taste any of the Nutella... I don't even know if there was any in there! Haha. I thought maybe if we got a hot Nutella latte we'd maybe be able to taste the Nutella better?  I give this place three stars because I love the decor inside and everyone was very friendly!!"}
{"text":"Really disappointed with this coffee shop.... here I am spending 12 dollars on two Americanos... & it's just not that great Let's first start off with the price.... charging me an additional cost for vanilla/caramel...  Drive through has charged me extra for cream when I can walk in and get it myself  I get home with my vanilla Americano and I taste nothing of vanilla ! It's tastes like a black creamed americano....  Waste of .65 cents right there...  I ordered a small and a large and I get charged for two larges...  :(  To get home with my coffee and it's just not great at all.  I don't find myself coming back  The iced latte ratio of espresso to milk tastes like it's just all milk...  It's off And I'm sad because I really liked this place before  But I can't afford to pay 6 dollars for my coffee and it's horrible"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere.  Knowledgeable baristas. Quick service.  Very pleasant staff.  Rose real latte so delicious! Nice snacks too."}
{"text":"I went to Sambalatte just for their rainbow latte, but I'll return for their fun latte flavors like rose petal and pistachio. The inside seating isn't quiet as plentiful or cozy as other coffee shops, but the coffee itself is very good- the lattes are extremely smooth, to the point that flavoring isn't needed or missed. They have several baked goods (muffins, turnovers, croissants) and fresh eats (sandwiches, quiche). Though the Rampart location is closer to me, I easily preferred this one for it's large patio, drive-thru option, and friendly counter service."}
{"text":"The Nutella latte is AMAZING and Teddy is fantastic! (Not too sweet) I am so glad I am no longer stuck with Starbucks. This place is the real deal."}
{"text":"Second Sambalatte location in the same mall with Kyara.  Since we moved from San Francisco, we had hard time looking for great coffee shops that offer consistent high quality espresso drinks. Sambalatte in Summerlin was great, but was too crowded and loud.  This location is in a much quieter neighborhood which is a big plus.  Prices are on the high end, but the quality is well worth the buck.  I'll come back often."}
{"text":"prices are what's to be expected at a trendy spot, but their baked goods are tasty and the coffee is definitely worth it. Nutella latte was on point. ask for it on ice and it's bomb too. Starbucks who ?"}
{"text":"My favorite local coffee shop. Great customer service, they are fast and personable. Latte, cold brew and cortado are bae:)"}
{"text":"I will start this by saying that I love coffee and have tried many places other then the normal Starbucks. I drove past this place the other day and decided to give it a try. First off I noticed the pricing was completely ridiculous... 5.50 for a 16oz?? But I decided why not try it, I'm willing to pay the price if the coffee taste great. I am the only one in line at the time so I place my order and drove  up to the window.. You would think someone would be at the window to greet me, not the case. Not even a \"hey I'll be right with you\". I waited 10 minutes for someone to come to the window!! I wish that were an exaggeration but sadly it's not! I literally almost drove off especially seeing how the lobby wasn't busy and no one else was in line besides myself, so why did it take so long to bring me my coffee or even just come to the window to greet me?! Finally a guy comes to the window ask for 5.50 and hands me my drink, no customer service was there at all!! I ordered a caramel frap no whip, he handed me a 16oz drink that wasn't even filled to the top, watered down not like a frap at all, and it tasted like burnt coffee beans!!! I was so pissed especially for the price! I'm not a huge Starbucks fan but there is one down the road from this place I would have rather gone to and gotten my money's worth!! Needless to say I will NEVER go waste my money or time there again!"}
{"text":"I love their coffee. I don't mind spending money on delicious coffee but their prices are a little insane. For ONE pump of flavoring, it's still $0.75. I give them a lot of my money and the last couple of times has made me decide that I will no longer go there. I always get charged a different price for the exact same thing I order all the time. I finally said something and they were very nice and said that they have 2 different buttons on their register and that it's getting worked on. I'm sorry, but this has happened so often. It's expensive. Almost $6.00 for a small vanilla latte.  Just a few days ago I ordered 2 different lattes. Mine wasn't even warm and I had already left the drive thru but i refused to let it go for $6.00. I went back thru the drive thru and they were a little aggravated but remade my drink.  Another time, the person handing me the drink, was also giving me my change and asked if I wanted my quarter. Umm, yes, I do just because you asked me! I'd have rather given my money to them but i guess I'll just go back to coffee bean."}
{"text":"Thy have good coffee. It's not the best I have ever had, but I do prefer it to Starbucks. I got a 16oz White Mocha for $5.00."}
{"text":"This is a cozy and delicious coffee shop!! I had a red velvet loaf and latte. The ambience is beautiful, and service great. Espresso is on point!"}
{"text":"Coffee shop out of no where!  Had a delightful cup of Nutella Cappacino! No need to add sugar, the nutella gave it enough sweetness.  Really enjoyed the toasted ham and cheese croissant breakfast sandwich. The croissant was warm and flaky and crispy. Yummy.  A wonderful substitute morning coffee place when I can't get a cup of Philz nearby."}
{"text":"Quaint little place, lattes and Cappuccinos are great! Great for quick meetings but not for quiet working Can be loud and crowded."}
{"text":"Nice, relaxing good cafe.  I  had Latte, and I like it.  Also, it was served in a big white nice mag!  Staff is also nice.  I want to come here again if I come nearby and want to have a chat over a coffee, I think =)"}
{"text":"Delightful cappuccinos and the chocolate chip biscotti was amazing.  The bad part is this place is VERY loud which makes it almost impossible to get any work done. Also it seems smaller than the Summerlin location, so hard to get away from the noise. I would suggest going here with friends instead of working/studying/reading."}
{"text":"Always clean, polite, and all around lovely.  Coffee is great, staff is great, atmosphere is great (although the music is a teenie bit loud, but that's just me and it doesn't bother me because it drowns out conversations around me).  I personally come here to study every weekend. I highly recommend"}
{"text":"While I think their lattes, cappuccinos and other beverages are somewhat overpriced, you can't beat the quality and flavor.  We love the Nutella latte and peppermint hot tea.   As an aside, you must try one of their muffins - they are buttery deliciousness."}
{"text":"My experience here went fairly well. I ordered an iced peppermint mocha with soy milk and it was alright. It was more peppermint than mocha, but I still enjoyed it anyway.   PROS: -Large lobby area, great for groups and a lot of seating. -Prices of the drinks are fair. -People in the front counter were polite and attentive. -Restrooms are CLEAN.  -They have an outside seating area as well if you want some fresh air.  CONS: -The volume of the music they play is way too loud. I came here wanting a quiet place to read a book, but the music was too distracting. -Chairs in the lobby are uncomfortable.  My experience wasn't over the top amazing, but it wasn't bad either, just OK."}
{"text":"Met there with clients after touring in the rain all day last Friday.    Do I have to really say if I am going to pay over $5 for a coffee drink that I expect it to be hot?  Our entire party's order was lukewarm.  Not ok."}
{"text":"Mehhhh...  The girl at the counter was really rude. She acted like doing her job was a huge inconvenience.   The coffee was really expensive and just ok. The Nutella latte had zero flavor and my friends vanilla iced latte was not drinkable.  The best part about our visit was the macaroons.  I won't be back"}
{"text":"Walked in for my first ever visit and was greeted by a very friendly and personable staff. They spend time explaining the Steam Punk and options of coffee to me. I generally love Guatemalan coffee so I pick that one. Because I wanted to taste the different notes the staff spoke of I did NOT add sweetener or cream like I normally do to even my French pressed coffee. That was the right decision...this black coffee was delish!! The staff made sure I knew about the frequent drinker card too. I will be back for my morning coffee because I didn't feel like I was within a cattle call for a great cup of coffee."}
{"text":"This place is great. Like a much better Starbucks(the coffee actually tastes like coffee and not that dirty water that they serve at Starbucks). The pastries are also great. Quite possibly the best blueberry muffin that I have ever eaten!"}
{"text":"This place doesn't know how to make a cappuccino. I don't always order cappuccino but when I do I at least expect it to be different from a latte. There is a thin layer of foam on top of a sea of steamed milk in my cappuccino while the foam should be equal part to the milk. So disappointed.  I guess this place is called Sambalatte because they only know how to make lattes."}
{"text":"4.5/5 but not allowed to do half points.... So rounded up 5 stars.  Why not the perfect 5 star? Because the service overall is normally great.... But I have been a few times where the baristas were a little bit snooty.... They were arguing with me on how best to drink my coffee.... I mean I understand that they are trying to teach me BUT it should always be a suggestion.  Everyone's taste buds are a little different....u know? :)   On the other hand.... The coffee has always been delicious!!!!  I have not had one cup of Joe to speak that I have not enjoyed 100%.  Every single cup....I have had had been delicious. :). I've tried some of the flavors lattes....Nutella being my favorite.... The steam punk is always top notch.... I've tried a couple of different mixes.... And they were all great. On the cold side... Frappes were always good....iced lattes were good too.  They also have pellegrino which I love to drink. One of my most favorite sparkling waters. :)  The food I have never had as they've never really appealed to me.... So I can't say anything about that.   When I think of great coffee.... Sambalatte always comes to mind for me. :D the service sometimes is a miss.... BUT the coffee is da bomb!!!!"}
{"text":"I tried the Nutella cappuccino and it was delicious. Not too sweet and just the right amount of Nutella taste. I complimented my coffee with an almond macaroon. The macaroon was tasty, and they had a wide variety of selection of flavors!   I will be coming here again to study, work, meet a friend, and enjoy the ambiance. It's very spacious as well and has outdoor seating."}
{"text":"Awesome - love this atmosphere, food and drinks. Everyone is super friendly. Better than starbucks by far"}
{"text":"Fab! Incredible coffee def get the Nutella cappuccino if you are around or visiting Vegas - this location rocks!"}
{"text":"My daughter has a college interview at Starbucks right up the street so we decided to wait for her at Sambalatter, nice treat and break from the usual Starbucks routine. I always love getting the sweet hearts on my coffee here, worth the extra dime. Cappuccino is always so robust and rich, love it."}
{"text":"Such a great addition to their original location.  Even though it's not as grand as the Boca Park location, it's still a really great comfortable place to sip coffee and work out of.  This location is super convenient since it's next to I-215.  What a great place to grab a Nutella latte!  I love coffee, and I didn't think coffee could get any better, but then you add Nutella to it!"}
{"text":"European coffee and Jamaican coffee are the only types of coffee I can have without getting sick...so I try to make it here whenever I can.  I love the coffee and pastries here and would of given them five stars but the service at this location is horrible.  No one ever smiles at you and it seems like you're bothering them when you ask a question.  They need to learn a thing or two from the boca park location.   Update:  After my last review I received an email from the manager, Luiz who apologized for the bad customer service and asked me to go back and give them another try. Went back this morning and got the usual Nutella latte and almond croissant. Both were delicious as always and have to say the staff were really nice. There was only two people Working but both had a smile on their faces and no attitude."}
{"text":"My new study spot, loved the matcha latte! On a nice day, they have a patio that's very relaxig to sit on. I used the wifi which was pretty fast and sat by the window."}
{"text":"No Macaroons!!! Service was horrible! Stood at counter 5 minutes before anyone acknowledged us.  It was nine in the morning on a Sunday, and they were not that busy. And we still didn't get any help. We walked out."}
{"text":"I really do love sambalatte, the staff is always great. The reason I'm giving 3 stars is because for the last year I have been asking for an organic milk option, and every time the baristas tell me coming soon. They offer lots of organic treat options but no milk to date. I would love to have a organic whole milk cappuccino to compliment their delicious coffee beans. As soon as that happens I'm more than happy to give 5 stars. Thank you"}
{"text":"That's some dang good coffee! Wow!!!! Friendly staff too :) it's a bit expensive, but they use local products and they're like the corner coffee shop, so I don't mind :) definitely worth checking this place out!"}
{"text":"Come here like 3-4 times a week usually. Best coffee in Vegas hands down. Better than Starbucks. It's so smooth. I always get an iced white mocha. It's the best!!!! Sometimes a Nutella which I also enjoy. But the iced white is where it's at! All employees are always super friendly and awesome. Love the loyalty card too."}
{"text":"Nice quiet environment to catch up with friends. Have tried the nutella & also the lavender latte; both are equally good. If you dine in & drink from a mug, the staff does latte art which adds a nice touch. Staff is helpful & pricing is fair in comparison to other chains such as Starbucks. There is indoor & outdoor seating available. Only downside is that they close at 6 pm on weekdays, which I think is a bit too early."}
{"text":"This coffeeshop is a cute, small chain in Las Vegas with three locations. I came here to the Jones one and had the Lavender Latte which tasted good. I also was requesting a particular drink just a milk tea for a friend and the barista recommended a Peppermint Green Tea Latte. I don't know why they recommended that when I was seeking a completely different basic tea latte, more of black tea not peppermint.. (they said they don't have or couldn't make it so I went with what they suggested). That was not very helpful at all and my friend could not even drink it sad day! I basically had to give up my Lavender Latte and I drank her Peppermint Green Latte bleh.  I definitely like the drinks, vibes, and service more of the other Boca Park location than this one. 3 stars.~"}
{"text":"Day late and a $1 short. I went to get some coffee before a meeting. I went through the drive thru to find that it wasn't working and had to go in. I had my heart set on lavender latteand found out they had no lavender :( . I decided on the raspberry white chocolate latte. It was good but ended up too sweet. The coffee shop itself was clean,neat and organize. The clerks helped me as soon as I walked in. I would have rated it higher if only they had the lavender."}
{"text":"This place is EXPENSIVE. The drinks and baked goods we got were tasty but nothing special. Their sizes of drinks are relatively small compared to other cafes and the prices are too much. The specialty drinks sounded like a great new fresh idea and the taste didn't match up to our expectations. We liked it but we probably won't come back. Oh and there aren't any trash cans outside on their eating area which was also weird."}
{"text":"Use to be addicted to my coffee and reading a great book to start my days off. Just seems recently not something do as much. Sambalatte Torrefazione though is one coffee shop that I have had my radar on for sometime. I meet friend at the Rampart location for conversation catching up more so then coffee. So just happen hanging out with friends looking for place kill half hour before dinner reservations. Perfect opportunity it was on the way!   I had the white mocha. Talk about some serious coffee artwork. I am sure we all take it for guaranteed go fancy coffee shop the little things. Like the foam on top not just scoop of foam. I know I was impressed. Or fact that we all come use too Starbuck or brand name chains forget what its like to get great cup of java in nice wide rim big coffee cup. I got my coffee felt bad not sure the best way to deconstruct the artwork. I did. It tasted really good.  I really enjoy looking at the menu. It has that old coffee shop vibe with the long chalkboard menu. They write all the different selection and the names on it. Not only coffee they sell. Sure you have your pastry section, pre package sandwiches, and assortment of other bottle beverages. They have another section off the side with healthy option comes too beverages like coconut waters and healthy bottle water options. The macaroons looked really good again nice diverse selection of macaroons.   I like that they have few outside patio seating options. Inside is decent size for coffee shop. The service was fabulous. Everyone was very attentive, friendly, and  made the half hour go by quick. No doubt found my new go spot get my coffee and reading on. Or just want hang out with friends over great cup of java and great conversations another go spot for me."}
{"text":"I'm very happy that this new location is super convenient to my house and the drive thru is definitely a plus. The lines are never painfully long and the baristas are always so excited to see my puppies and give them treats in the drive thru. The staff here is much more personable and caring than any other coffee shop or chain. I try to stop by here every morning for my favorite iced white mocha."}
{"text":"Great place to meet friends, study and enjoy yourself! I love the unique coffees, like the Nutella latte."}
{"text":"I come to to this location often. The problem is that their drive thru service is so frustrating. When they first opened, I was a little more sympathetic about the wait (15 mins minimum!), but a few years have passed since then and they still seem disorganized and unable to handle more than 3 cars in the drive thru. If there are is 1 or 2 cars in front of us, I already know to get comfortable in the car. I love their iced mochas (i wouldnt dare order anything else more complicated in the drive thru), and sometimes it tastes AMAZING. Other times it's bitter or too milky. I wish that they would at least keep the consistency of their drinks, especially if it is going to take so long!"}
{"text":"I love Sambalatte but my experience today was just \"okay.\" I was waiting in line and a woman blatantly cut the line in front of me, the barista saw, and said nothing, a \"I think she was next\" would have been the appropriate response.    That aside, I usually sing Sambalatte's praises to anyone who will listen, but my experiences at the original location are far more favorable than at this store. Maybe I'm just cranky, but in the future I will fight the crappy parking at Boca Park, and go there to get my fix instead. (The pastry/salad/sandwich case seems more fully stocked at BP too.)"}
{"text":"Updating to 5 stars. This place is great. The only chain to have coffee in Vegas. Food quality improved significantly. Not sure why I have to write more for this review to count.. I already wrote a detailed review.. Just updating my star rankings."}
{"text":"Really excited to try this place out since I have never been to the Boca park one.  I don't like drinking coffee but I still wanted the foam art so I got the green tea latte and it so good! If you've ever had those Japanese green tea kit kats it tasted like that, so yummy every sip. I also got 2 macaroons the almond and caramel. I was pretty disappointed since they have so much hype. They were both way too sweet and overwhelming. Maybe I got the wrong ones.   This place is worth a try and they have plenty of seats outside for nice weather days. I want to come back and try the Nutella latte."}
{"text":"I never made it out the other Sambalatte but had it bookmarked a long time so was excited they were opening up here near S. Jones and 215, same place as Kyara and Tropical Smoothies.  It's nice inside with a few tables and a long bar top but it doesn't seem like it can hold a lot of people. There are some tables outside though since the weather is nice sit outside if it gets crowded.  I've had a few of their drinks so far and I liked them. For what they offered and what I had I liked them. I had the Nutella Latte, the White Mocha, the Caf√© Con Leche. I heard that they make some nice and creative designs in their drinks. I've only gotten the heart which was ok maybe I need to stop taking my drink to go and they'll do something nicer.   It seems like I was a bigger fan of their pastries and food. Everything looked so good. I ordered the Ham and Cheese Croissant and really like it. It was warm, cheesy, and flakey. I'd order it again. I want to try one of their quiche as a meal and something on the dessert side next.   The layout seems a little wrong because if you come from the front door, which is the closest to the parking lot, you'll have to walk through people waiting for their orders to make your order.  They have a drive thru but I'm not sure if they're functional yet."}
{"text":"A great local spot to grab a delicious cup of coffee and hang out with friends. Their Nutella cappuccino and almond croissant are delicious!"}
{"text":"dessert is nice, but their (black) coffee and espresso taste pretty terrible...."}
{"text":"Love that Sambalatte is now open on 215 & Jones, don't have to drive all the way to summerlin~  This location is a lot smaller than the one out in summerlin but there's more seating available outside vs inside I think. It's great to sit outside on a warm day but not on a hot vegas summer day of 104+degrees...  I went around 6pm on a Wednesday and there were only a few people there so the service was quick! I ordered the iced macha latte. They didn't ask me for a size so I thought it would be a regular or something but when I got my drink it was in a large cup! It was delicious & worth your money. I also ordered a nutella latte before and that was great too.  They have a variety of pastries/desserts that you can purchase as well; including  macaroons!   Great place to grab a coffee and chill or catch up with friends.  There's tons of parking outside of the shop too!"}
{"text":"Maybe I went at the time when the employee wanted to smile and was okay with answering questions? This was only my second time at a Sambalatte and I was not sure on the many yummy sounding options.  There were 2 employees that of which I saw a younger female and mid sized male.  The female made suggestions when we told her what we usually drank and what we liked.  We got the lavender white and nonwhite latte. Also a croissant, cherry cheese danish and 2 macaroons... the almond was wayyy better than pistachio. ;) The reason I didn't give 5 stars honestly I was kind of disappointed my latte was just brown and white... I really thought that the design would be purple. I know this sounds stupid. But this was why we went... we did like our drinks but for the next time I want to try something lighter and maybe request for the design to be in color."}
{"text":"I've been there several times and by far the best cafe ever. Amazing staff and amazing items!!! I just tried the Nutella latte... Perfection!!!!.. I have all of my meetings there now as well... Cheers"}
{"text":"I saw photos of Samabalatte's Rainbow Latte on Instagram and I had to try one. The barista told me the Rainbow Latte has no flavor so you have to choose your own. He recommended  Lavender and White Chocolate so I went with that. I had to wait 15 minutes for what I ordered and when it came I was so disappointed. It did not look like a Rainbow Latte to me :( The design only had faint red and green colors. The drink itself was not even hot and it wasn't very tasty either."}
{"text":"I have been eyeing this place for a while... Knew it was very popular, and wow .. was I right. First impression walking in was \"wow its busy.\" I loved the variety of drink choices, the workers were really nice and friendly , willing to help! The enviroment is pretty cool, but finding seats was a little overwhelming, the cafe was a little bit cramped and crowded. A lot of college students were digin the free WiFi. To access the free wifi, you can get the code on the bottom of your receipt :) Coffee was VERY good, got a White Mocha Latte, tasted like excellent coffee with a mix of hot chocolate. My uncle got a java chip frappucinno,  he wasnt to pleased. It was too liquidity and wasnt very cold.Carrying the beautiful art filled lattes over to my seat was really hard, it spilled a little.But the nice lady working there, gave us a little back story on the macaroons, a famous French Baker makes the macaroons & they are shipped there. If you do not pick up the macaroons, you are missing out!  I gave this place four stars, because in my opinion my coffee was magnificent.Also the macaroons just put it over the top. Will be coming back sometime, but probably earlier in the morning!"}
{"text":"I recently visited Sambalatte to try their \"Rainbow Latte\". It was so beautiful and unique!! The baristas were so sweet and the lattes were so delicious. This is a new favorite!"}
{"text":"I'd been here prior and was impressed enough to bring my brother and girlfriend out here to try it for themselves. Today however was not nearly as I had previously recalled my first visit.  My brother and I both avid coffee drinkers were looking forward to having just a simple iced coffee but to our dismay they did not have any. Now we were not distraught enough to leave and not give them a chance we simply grabbed some iced americanos. I just found it odd for a coffee shop to not be prepared on a Monday morning in Las Vegas with such a simple staple to a coffee menu. With that in mind our drinks were great quality and the coffee did redeem our visit only sparingly.  The woman at the register was clearly new as she was asking questions of the other two baristas as she was ringing us up. This was the other situation I felt just simple was not handled well from the customer's point of view. I've been a barista trainer now for the better part of 5 years and as the trainer you are the bridge between customer and trainee and it is up to you to ensure the interaction goes well for both parties. As the customer we felt awkward the trainee was searching for buttons and you could sense that she was uneasy from our point of view and her fellow baristas did not come to her aide.  Overall if you are looking for a good cup of coffee and a place to study by all means swing on through;however, if you enjoy that human interaction and friendly faces of smiling baristas there are plenty of new coffee shops popping up around town that can provide that smile."}
{"text":"My favorite place in town to grab a latte, but they are overpriced on food items. Great coffee and lovely atmosphere."}
{"text":"I drive out of my way to this coffee shop for the selection of coffees from around the globe and the process in which they brew. More specifically the steampunk and nitro cold brew. The steampunk machine has been broke for months and it seems that there is no foreseeable future where it will be fixed. Today employees couldn't attach the taps for cold brew. Another day where I have to leave not getting what I drove there for. To top it off the overall cleanliness has gone down hill. I hope with winter season around the corner they can get things worked out."}
{"text":"I got a good strong cup of cappuccino here.  They are known for their Nutella Latte ($5.25), but I just felt like having a cappuccino ($3.50).   They do varietal brews here on their steampunk machine.  There were flavor notes for all the coffees so I asked about the flavor notes iced coffee, which I was going to take for the road after I finished my cappuccino. Unfortunately the cashier and the barista said they couldn't tell me anything about the iced coffee other than they pour it out of a bottle. I wish I could say I was making that up, but they explained that their headquarters just had them switch the process a day ago. Before they used to make the iced coffee there, but now it's bottled at their central processing and shipped to the stores to sell as cold brew.  Understandable, but still, if it was my store, I would have had all of my staff taste it before we put it out so that they knew what the product was... especially since it didn't require them any work to prepare it.    They also carry eight hot teas and four different iced teas and they can do tea via the steampunk method.  The store is new inside with curves that curve back into another small back room and then curves again to the restrooms.  Okay, looking at the menu again, how did I miss seeing the Nutella Cappuccino ($3.75)?  FAIL HOWIE.  FAIL."}
{"text":"Only second time here and admittedly expensive but so worth it.... As a treat great coffee frappe is delicious!  And the almond croissant is amazing!!! Unreal thing is the cashier remembered my name after only one other time there!!! Cashier wonderful great friendly personality ..... True alittle stuffy in there and people tend to just stay long after the coffee is gone using their wireless and not allowing other patrons to sit but all on all a great place to treat yourself"}
{"text":"This place is a hip place to be,.. great fit business or with friends. The coffee never seems to be hot enough for my personal preference, even when I am that they make it hot... But overall they have great drinks and fresh pastries which I love. Wish they had more tea lattes but maybe their coffee is good because that's the only thing they concentrate on."}
{"text":"I am absolutely in love with Sambalatte's cappuccino. It's fresh, dark and rich. If you like light and nutty tastes, this is not for you. If you enjoy dark coffee with some milk and foam, you can't go wrong.  The shop is very photogenic and the coffee mugs were adorable. It has \"Las Vegas' on the outside and inside the cup it has \"sip. savour. socialize.\" Nice touch! Great for taking photos.  While I'm glad I found this place during my Vegas vacation, I'm very sad that I can't have it when I'm home. Please, Sambalatte, open a shop in the San Francisco Bay Area! I miss your cappuccino. :("}
{"text":"Love their hot chocolate with cinnamon it always reminds me of my grandmas which was the best of all time. Not really a fan of their pastries they are kind of dry. But their Nutella latte and blended white mocha are to die for!"}
{"text":"I wish they would throw in a couch or two, but the place is lovely anyway! Nicely laid out & laid back. No hectic vibe, but still very quick. Everyone seems as green as the store ( I've had 2 small mistakes, nothing big), but they were super attentive & apologetic about it. Seems like once the staff gets into the groove, this will be a top notch spot to get a top notch coffee. So, be kind, cut them some slack for these first few weeks. I sure am!"}
{"text":"Had a quiche Lorraine and the pumpkin spice latte. The quiche was delicious, I think it was an egg white quiche, but I'm not 100% sure because it was so good. The crust is a flaky pastry crust often used for croissants, very delicious. The pumpkin spice latte didn't taste overly pumpkin-like but you can savor the taste of pumpkin pur√©e. It's perfectly sweetened, didn't need any additional sweeteners and with first sip was a little bitter, like black coffee, but I like that. Best cup of coffee I've ever had.   Great atmosphere for meeting up with friends or for work. There's music playing in the background not too loudly, I mean you can hear it but it doesn't distract you. I will probably grab another to go before I leave this cafe."}
{"text":"Such horrible service for such a nice establishment..  Stood in line for at least 8 to 10 minutes and was not acknowledged at all. Not even a hello or a I will be right with you.  Especially with me being in the service industry I really expected more from a place like this.  Extremely disappointed with the service I did not get and will not come back again. I can't even give it a star because I was not even acknowledged.   Well I had to leave a star to post a comment but if I had my say you would not get one."}
{"text":"Spacious, clean, large window walls, shaded patio seating (it's a tunnel like, so you can catch a breeze), good quality food (I've yet to try the hot beverages), the tropical iced tea isn't that great, multiple plugs available, but it's a few minutes to 7:45pm and it's closed already. I will definitely consider returning here to study for time frames during the day."}
{"text":"I thought Starbucks was bad. Sambalatte is worse. Stopped in got a large hot vanilla latte. The cup was at best 16oz for $5.50. I don't mind paying for good coffee but this was barely warm and very bitter. Want a better local coffee shop go to sunrise or tipsy's much better coffee."}
{"text":"Hmm, a group of friends and I came here with the interest of getting some coffee and snacks as we play board games. We quickly found out that this would not be the ideal place because there was not really much room since the tables were so tiny. In fact, if two people get a pastry dish, you will not have enough space to put both pastry holders on the same table. I get they are short on space, but I think they could have a couple bigger tables to help with issue.  Alright, now onto the food/ drinks. Mmmm all the food sitting behind the bar looked so so tasty, but I didn't know how much most of it was. I already spent 5 bucks on a smallish coffee and could only imagine the prices of food. I did have the opportunity to sample a friends nutella bomb, that was devoured 30 seconds after eating it. So we know it was tasty.  Anyways, my white chocolate mocha coffee was great. It was the perfect drink to sip and read a book. But due to the spacing issue, I found myself quickly chugging it so we could relocate to another place to find space for our board games."}
{"text":"Lavender latte was incredible. Great taste and super fragrant lavender undertones. The macarons are probably the best I've had in Vegas. I would strongly recommend you check this place out if you're a coffee connoisseur like me"}
{"text":"Imagine a coffee  shop where you walk in the door and you hear angels singing in all there glory and smell the aroma of what coffee fanatics think is heaven on earth .. Smooth coffee brewing and sugary pastries filling the air!  I was a twice a day Starbucks addict for about 14 years. I stopped going to SB because of some things the CEO said that put me off, but I digress! I was looking for another coffee alternative. Well I had to look no further than this amazing coffee joint!   The coffee was smooth and amazing! I've never tasted coffee so good before! I was so used to over roasted coffee that my palate was destroyed to what true beans should smell and taste like! The white mocha ( iced ) had the perfect balance of creaminess and acidity! I'm in heaven! I love that this location has a drive through and may options for food.   I will recommend this joint to everyone! Especially because it has a great ambience and its rooming as well as warm and inviting! The baristas are friendly and it's clean! You can't go wrong! Try it out! You won't be disappointed! My only complaint is that the don't have more locations in town!!"}
{"text":"I gotta say all the sambalatte locations are really nice! This one has no 2nd floor, but seems to have good lighting and seating inside & outside! I came here to catch up with a friend who was studying.   I do like sambalatte and is a great place to get things done or chat for a little bit in the mornings. They close early which is why it's always best to go on the mornings there! I do like the Nutella coffee they have! There is good selection of music as well to have a good atmosphere!"}
{"text":"The coffee drinks and macarons are fabulous!! My son loves the penguin hot chocolate. I can't wait for the drive thru to open, but that could be a bad thing for me ;)"}
{"text":"Macaroons are great (almond) and nutella anything rocks! I am so glad this is close to my work!"}
{"text":"I wanted to give it more stars but my first time in the Jones location was sort of a miss.  I asked the gal at the register for a veggie quiche  (which I spotted in the display case) and a berry ice tea TO GO and she said \"we don't have any more veggie quiche.\" I said,  \"I wonder why the ones in the case say veggie then?\"  She then said \"oh I'm sorry\" and then asked me if I wanted it to go?  I will probably go in again to give them another chance being that they just opened and have to get the kinks out.  By the way the quiche was priced a tad high and seemed a bit small compared to other establishments I have frequented. I also inquired about blended coffee and if they had almond milk to which a Barista stated they did but the flavoring they used would have dairy in it.  To that another day."}
{"text":"Try their Red Rock Latte! Or the raspberry white mocha. This location offers drive thru and sit down."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place. It's a great location complete  with a drive thru. The baked goods are yummy and the service is great, however, I go to a \"coffee\" place for great coffee. The way I judge a place is based on their espresso shots. On two different occasions their espresso tasted burnt. I tried this place two times and I was disappointed both times. So I will not come back nor do I recommend their coffee."}
{"text":"Being born and raised in Vegas you'd think I'd have more serious vices, but my main addiction is caffeine. Hook it up to my viens!   First off, I love the style and atmosphere in here; great colors and a seemingly inviting staff. Some of the prior reviews mention that the staff here can be polarizing and straight up rude. So I walked in ready for battle, but was greeted by a mustache and a smile...   \"Welcome to Sambalatte, you prick\"... Did he say prick or am I manifesting previous reviews from my psyche into real life situations?... Calm down man, be cool. \"Good morning, I'll have an iced americano and that tasty looking nutella... scone?\", \"It's actually a biscotti you numbed skulled turd burglar\"... WTF? Did he just say that outloud?... \"Is that it?\"... \"Yeahhhh\" ... \"That'll be $7.35, you disgusting peasant\"...   The above situation is what I had imagined would happen when I walked into Sambalatte, but actually everyone here was very helpful and chipper. My iced americano wasn't bitter tasting, in fact it was super smooth, and the nutella treat was a great addition to my beverage. I was only here for about fifteen minutes, but I did notice ample seating inside and a large patio space for the decently heated evenings we get here in Vegas.   Coffee up!"}
{"text":"First let me start by saying I am a die hard Starbucks fan so I might be a little bias. I will say I wanted to try something new because I'm a little burnt out on Starbucks snacks. I went to Sambalatte to get some coffee and their ham and cheese croissant that I saw so many pictures of on yelp. Lucky me I got the last one and it did not disappoint! Unfortunately though my white mocha with and extra shot was not hot and only just okay. I also spent at least 12 mins in the drive thru with only one car in front of me. I might come back just for the croissant but over all the coffee was cold, service was slow and prices are quite steep."}
{"text":"So i ordered my soy chai and white mocha, both 16 oz. and then the amount of my order was not giving to me until my card was already swiped and asked \"is that okay?\" like wow i'm very disappointed because i truly enjoy the coffee from here, this was just a sad time ): i have higher expectations from Sambalatte."}
{"text":"Super quick service, easy menu. The matcha latte is amazing! Also ordered a scone and it was not as dry as others, which I liked. They serve almond milk which is also a plus because I don't drink cow milk. Drive thru made it super convenient.   I think the most important thing to add is that my drink was hot, but not so hot to where I couldn't enjoy it immediately. I hate having to wait 10 minutes for my coffee to cool before I drink it."}
{"text":"Jasmine, Hanna coolest Baristas. Thanks for being pleasant n providing great customer service. My Sis loves their pistachio macaroons. Delicious.!! Thanks! We will be back."}
{"text":"I love the coffee, but went through the drive through and ordered a nitro cold brew. Then I got a regular iced coffee and the person working the window left before I could ask why. I went inside and finally had someone tell me they were out of nitro. Would have been nice to know in the drive through so I could have ordered something else."}
{"text":"I'm so happy about this new store. The original is impossible to get a parking spot at. Now I can ride my bike to get my Flat White. Which I highly recommend. Coffee is so good in the steam punk brewer. Store does not have the 'charm' of the original, but coffee is just as good."}
{"text":"Love, love, love the espresso at Sambalatte!  It's the best in Las Vegas, hands down.    If you're coming to chat with a friend, you'll have enough background noise to keep your conversation semi-private but not enough to drown anything out.  If you're coming to work on your laptop, you'll be able to at the very least grab a spot on the long table stretching across the window, but you'll likely have your own small table all to yourself.  Is a great spot for either activity.  And plenty of seating outdoors as well.    The owner is very involved at all of his locations - always putting love into his stores.  He tries various products - locally made chapstick, vegan protein bars, nut-free vegan PB cups, etc.  Always trying to provide the most positive experience.    Friendly employees.  Just an all-around great operation."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time today and I fell in LOVE. Amazing vibes and just such a cool culture. I got the iced white mocha and my best friend got the Nutella cappuccino and both were equally delicious. My white mocha was exactly what I needed in this Nevada heat. The service was great and it was a chill environment. I cannot wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I have had half a dozen visits here and enjoyed every one. Ambiance is great and the drinks are well made. This place is worth passing up Starbucks for."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Coffee shop in Las Vegas. They have a couple of locations and they are all amazing. As a Brazilian, I have to recommend this place and also let you know that's owned by a Brazilian.  Brazilian coffee is super good, but the only cons I have is the price. It should be cheaper, but when you try their lates you will understand why the price is high.  They draft good coffee!!! Have fun and enjoy a wonderful environment with live music and Brazilian MPB."}
{"text":"I won't be coming back. I was the only one in the drive thru. I ordered my drink, they told me to pull up to the window. Then after 3-4 minutes of waiting, the lady came to the window and didn't know my order. I had to repeat it to her. I felt bad, it was like she was the only one working. It took me about 10 minutes to get thru a drive thru with no one in line.  Every time I go here, the drink taste different. They don't have a standard for how many pumps of sweetener to put into the drinks I guess. I get a Iced Vanilla Latte, and the last time, about 6 months ago, I went there it was beyond drinkable because they filled it with too much syrup The next time I go, they didn't put any in.   Also, they used to have a reward system (they still might have it), where you buy a certain number of drinks, you get one free. I purchased the same drink 10 or 12 (whatever the reward system was) times. When I got to my free drink, they charged me for flavoring the free drink since vanilla latte is not on the menu. The latte was free, not the vanilla!  I got a croissant and they don't heat it or anything. It was not fresh and couldn't believe they charge $4.25 for that.   It's too bad, because I generally like there coffee when they make it right (which is rare and too costly to trial and error to pray they make it right!)"}
{"text":"MY RIGHT HAND. MY GO-TO.   Sambalatte is my coffee partner in crime, my sidekick, and probably the reason why I can't shed these few pounds. Le sigh.   Speaking as the Duchess, I can tell you that Nutella lattes here are THE TRUTH. Their selection of local pastries are beautiful but on the pricey side. Muffins are an affordable solid choice and they have recently started carrying banana muffins along with their usual blueberry, chocolate, carrot, and bran choices.   I come here so often that the baristas recognize my voice through the drive-thru speaker and introduce me personally to their new hires. My coworkers rarely see me walk through the door without a coffee in my hand and some even refer to me strictly as \"Sambalatte\" when they see me. It's gotten a little out of control lol.   Shout out to Diana, Fifi, Egypt and the rest of the crew - You're the best coffee squad I could ever hope for."}
{"text":"A great place for good quality coffee!  I usually have the Ethiopian Steampunk which is quite delicious.  As someone who loves coffee this place is like a dream come true.     The staff is always friendly and make the experience the fun time it should be.  The interior is inviting and sets the mood for the caffeine influx that I came for.  They also have plenty of tasty macaroons and other treats.   If you like a real coffee experience then Sambalatte is the place."}
{"text":"CAFE VIBES  Walked in here since I have been trying to get out of the house more often & being more productive w/ my day... saw on yelp that they had a pretty good review.   I'm not much of a coffee drinker but I do like tea lattes! They seemed a bit busy when I came & the staff was running around a bit. They took my order & my drink was ready pretty quickly. Not so much of an actual cafe style since they don't deliver your drink to you but more like Starbucks style where you pick up your drink at the window.  The table areas are a bit small so I will have to say it would be hard to lay out all your study stuff or work & laptop stuff & your drink & be comfortable...   MATCHA TEA LATTE $6.25 - it was SUPER green!! I like my green tea latte a little more creamy so this wouldn't be my favorite place to get it... but their design artwork is pretty ahahah. Also a bit on the expensive size.   Overall it was a nice experience but wouldn't really say it would be a place I would choose to come back to on a daily basis."}
{"text":"First time in a coffee shop in a very long time. Not a big coffee drinker. But since it's within walking distance and brand new, thought I'd give it a try.   Interior is very nice and spacious, yet maintains a sense of coziness. Decor is what you'd expect.   The pastries are expensive. I guess it is normal for these types of places, but $8 for an ham n egg n cheese muffin is a bit much. With that said, it all looked delicious.   Now to what I ordered. I have a chai latte. It was warm and not hot, which I don't really mind because I could drink it right away. But for those who like their drinks piping hot, you'll be disappointed. $5 for a chai latte is not something I'd do everyday, but when I'm in the mood for a fancy drink, I'll stop by again. Besides, it makes me feel snooty haha. Go in and have a drink, I'm sure you'll be happy you did. I liked my chai latte."}
{"text":"Was not impressed with this place. Once we walked in... We weren't even greeted. Told them it was our first time in and the cashier was just staring at us. Usually when a worker is told that... They would give some type of guidance or help as far as what's popular, etc. The guy just stood there staring off into space.   We felt pretty rushed, so we just ordered whatever. We also asked how much the pastry was and the cashier said she didn't know. How do you not know?! We got our order fairly quick... But lacking the taste. It was mediocre. Nothing that would make me want to come back here. They get a negative review for the poor customer service and our order being rushed. Eh, sucks! This is a pretty well known coffee spot. The employees should work hard to keep this place up and running as it should be.   They get a star for cleanliness. I'll give them that. And another star for their muffins!"}
{"text":"Nice coffee and tea here also they're have so many choice for drinks and some bakery. I like to order Ice Lavender Latte here and Ice Rose Latte.  A lot a table for hangout and work outsid."}
{"text":"I've been here several times already. I was impressed to find such a nice establishment in this quaint little suburb.  Overall the venue is pretty large, with plenty of seating inside and plug outlets for those like myself that like to sit and get some work done. There's appropriate music that isn't too loud playing in the background, and plenty of seating outside for larger parties and when the weather is good.   I haven't tried any of the food, but so far I've enjoyed their iced black ginger tea, and their Ethiopia coffee. I was surprised because I didn't recognize their siphon vacuums, and also because on the menu they're called \"steam punks.\" But they were able to make a pretty good cup of coffee, and have a few flavors that I have yet to try. I wouldn't recommend their iced coffee though -- it's like Starbucks. They basically make a batch of hot coffee that they pour over ice, which isn't a very good way to make it.   But overall, I've enjoyed all my experiences here and it's been one of my default places for a nice setting to use some free wifi, enjoy some indoor AC, and get some work done while sipping on a drink!"}
{"text":"Matcha latte is really good & to crave for, but just giving it 3 stars because they ran out quick too, 3 out of 5 times I was here! Pistachio flavored French macarons hmmm!  Nice atmosphere & they have a little corner in the back if you want a little bit more privacy or just hangout in the patio side & enjoy the nice weather with your perfect drink!"}
{"text":"Holy Day-Date!   If you're wondering where all the Match.com people are when they're not \"Online now!\" This is where they are, apparently!   Me and my, ahem, friend met up here, and we counted no less than four other pairs of like-birds (that's like love birds, but with more texting). Much different vibe than my Boca go-to, but much more sitting room. It was a lot more relaxed, yet the crowd was hardly as eclectic as Boca- not super cozy, but not a bad place to spend a couple hours learning about someone's last relationship and favorite color. :)"}
{"text":"Espresso is the best in Vegas.  The only rival that even comes close is tucked away in the Cosmo.  So this is great coffee without the hassle of the Strip."}
{"text":"* Review Update *  After my previous 3 start review, Sambalatte's kind manager was so humble to gift me with a gift card as an apology for their service. I am very pleased with their efforts to provide exceptional customer service. Purchased my favorite Caprese Baguette sandwich and their new Raspberry Infuser beverage. Both delish!   Thank you Luiz."}
{"text":"great atmosphere, real good coffee, and lots of options!! it is a little in the middle of nowhere, but i really enjoyed getting \"away\" for a couple hours and chatting with a friend while sipping on good coffee :)"}
{"text":"Stopped by while visiting Vegas for the fun rainbow lattes. They were very cute and very tasty. Ended up getting another latte to go because I actually enjoyed the coffee so much. A lot of the times you'll find that these places compromise the taste for the style but not here. Would have loved to try the nutella latte they offered but there were so many options and flavors, so hopefully I'll get to stop by here again."}
{"text":"This is the second time I've been to a Sambalatte and they happen to be out of Lavendar."}
{"text":"Delicious coffee, awesome artistry, nice staff, and clean place. Very cool vibes here"}
{"text":"Tried this fancy little caf√© today for the first time, and the 30 minute drive was pretty much worth it. Yes, that's right. I drove 30 minutes for coffee. I was very eager to try it because of the rave reviews here on Yelp, and it did not disappoint. The cashier/barista was very friendly and our order was ready pretty quickly. My boyfriend and I both got a food item and a coffee.   He had the ham and cheese croissant sandwich with a Tahitian Vanilla blended (frozen) latte. He was impressed with both of them. I tried his coffee and thought it was way too sweet for my taste but he likes his coffee extra sweet so it was a thumbs up for him.  I had the Veggie Quiche, and I really wasn't expecting to be blown away by their food because most of it is pre-made or pre-packaged, but this quiche...oh my god...this quiche. It is bomb. Very flavorful and fresh tasting with a perfect buttery flaky crust. And for the coffee, I had the Iced Nutella Latte. It was very good, no complaints here. It wasn't too sweet, it was just right and the coffee itself had great flavor.  Minor Complaints:  There food and certain beverages are absolutely outrageously priced! Yes, it's good food, but $8 for a ham and cheese sandwich? It better come with a side for 8 freaking dollars. Maybe give some fruit with it or something. We had 2 small food items and 2 large coffees, and our total was $27.50! Two people could eat at a restaurant for that much.  Now this part isn't necessarily Sambalatte's fault, but we got the DOUCHIEST VIBE from the people that were in there. Just seemed like everyone in there were a bunch of rich snobs and when we were leaving my boyfriend politely held the door open for a lady who was walking in and she gave him the dirtiest look and didn't even say thank you, she just said \"excuse me\" in a very bitchy tone. She acted like she didn't want him to even breath near her or something, it was just so rude.  All in all; if I'm on this side of town I will definitely come back for the coffee, I will have my order to go as I don't like the douchy hipster vibe it has, and although the food was good I probably won't buy food from here again because it was just too damn expensive."}
{"text":"Always friendly service from Jen and Diane, their coffee wakes me up and their warm friendly personas brighten my day. Even more impressive is they do all of this while juggling a lot of customers!"}
{"text":"This place is right by my work and after months of just driving right by it, I decided to finally check it out. The baristas are extremely helpful in explaining the menu and they even offered to make a new drink if I didn't like what I ordered. I loved their ginger infuser it's perfect for brutal summer days and since Las Gaygas gets 5 months of summer, I imagine this place can get quite busy. The place is very clean as well. So that's a definite plus! Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I like the coffee, but the reason for the 3 stars is because of the price. Seems a bit steep for coffee, so I don't come here everyday to get one. Bought macaroons here for 1.50 each. It's a bit pricey when I can go to manon for cheaper. Also, I used to come here a lot to study, but it is always busy with young teenagers and the music is sometimes insanely high. I feel like I'm in a club. Even with headphones, the music takes over. The baristas are nice though and always accommodating. They have free wi-fii and a frequent buyer card (for every 15 you buy, you get the 16th drink free)."}
{"text":"Never been inside but the people in the drive through are always very friendly and quick! Tried the Nutella drink and wasn't a fan but the java chip is my favorite! Pastries and muffins are great!!"}
{"text":"The baristas here are really nice. I've come here a few times now and I always enjoy my iced hazelnut latte"}
{"text":"Been a few times recently.  Mocha coffee drinks are fab...veggue quiche is very good but really pricey compared to other cafes that offer same size quiche. $9 compared to $6 elsewhere. Chocolate muffins are dry.  Will continue to go for coffee though."}
{"text":"Love this place. The drinks I've had so far are delish!! The staff is friendly & helpful. Only 4 stars because the floor could have used a sweep & some tables cleaned off... A good place to study, have a business talk, or just hang out. The patio is nice."}
{"text":"I love this location better than the one in Boca Park. The cashier was so friendly and helpful. She recommended for me to try the white mocha latte which was delicious. i asked her pricing for an item on the shelf and she was more than happy to help. She explained to me how they create some of their drinks. I want to try the this one they described to me that makes the perfect coffee.   I am huge with service and the cashier girl has sold me to come back. The barista was so adorable putting hearts and butterflies in the drinks. The place is usually busy but a good place to hangout or even study."}
{"text":"I LOVE samba! I would always come here to study for countless hours, I love their decor and setting, and their coffee is great but they always seem to be out of at least one ingredient which is aggravating when I can't get my favorite drink every day! Still love this place and I recommend it all the time"}
{"text":"Really good cold-pressed iced coffee and lattes. Baristas are helpful with beverage suggestions. A nice chill place to have a cup."}
{"text":"I was looking for some iced green tea to help me cool down on a hot day and Sambalatte came up in my Yelp search. I also tried a few of the macaroons and a biscotti on my visit. The macaroons were bite size and packed with flavor but the biscotti missed the mark. Very dry and lacking in flavor I would not try another one. The green tea was excellent and was waiting for me while I picked out my macaroons. Service came with a smile and she was very helpful answering my questions on other tea and snack options. Having a drive-thru is a plus."}
{"text":"Great coffee selections!!! Definitely a cool place to hang out and drink coffee and relax with friends!! They have a cute outdoor seating area and a place to hook your dog when you go inside to get your stuff! It also has a drive thru! Super awesome!"}
{"text":"This was my first time here and I enjoyed the matcha latte greatly. The service was prompt and the ambiance of the cafe was very warm. It was a quiet place to be for me to meet with a friend. I am going to be on this side of town more often so this will become a regular stop for me."}
{"text":"If you are looking for some good-quality coffee, Sambalatte is the right place to go. I am not a coffee expert, but I can tell the difference between a cup of Starbucks coffee and Sambalatte. The baristas are very friendly and knowledgeable. I usually ask them for recommendations on what to drink, and they are helpful every time. They are not just there to work their shifts and go home. I can REALLY feel their love about coffee. That's probably why Sambalatte is so good. :D Just like other locations, this one was fairly crowded. this location has a particularly small indoor seating area. Fortunately, they have a big outdoor seating area; finding a table is not an issue if you don't mind the hot weather.  FYI, they have some weird open hours, but I could not find the sign..."}
{"text":"Ahh delicious flat white!  I was so happy to find a true espresso place near Vegas. They roast their own beans as well. Wonderful decor as well."}
{"text":"I don't consider myself a coffee expert but the lattes I have ordered here were all pretty good.  This place doesn't have many \"unique\" drinks that will set them apart from the other coffee shops around Vegas in my opinion, but what they do have is pretty solid. The price is what you would expect from a specialty coffee shop, so I have no complaints there. All in all the place was good, I wouldn't say it's my go to place for coffee but I would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Second time in a week now that I've been here and had to try their chai latt√© with soy. Was not disappointed! So creamy and they didn't skimp on the cinnamon either which I loved. It was also very generous in size. They were out of iced green tea so we tried a hot one which was pretty standard and as you'd expect. This time I went for a sweet treat that I've been meaning to try here for a while and seeing as we're in the final, I went for a Knights brownie. This was ok, soft and .. just a brownie really! I've had better, I've had worse. I wasn't a massive fan of the icing or whatever it was that they put on top. Will try something different next time. Dropped a star because seating is a real issue in this place and if you're trying to study like we were, then trying to find a comfy seat with an outlet near by is challenging. The computer died so we finished our coffees and moved on."}
{"text":"Great place to enjoy a cup of coffee.  I think they have the best latte in town. Perfect place to hang out with your friends or browse on the internet. Interior design is awesome and staff is always friendly."}
{"text":"Butterscotch Unicorn Latte ON POINT!  So yumma and pretty!   Much bigger patio than Boca Park location!   Check this place out!  Support Local!"}
{"text":"Best lemonade in town !!!!! Deft come and get it , also try the turkey and Swiss on cranberry bagget insanely good"}
{"text":"This place earned my fan badge, not only because they can make a great Americano, but they make it with great friendly service.   I stopped in with a few friends, and we all ordered things. I ordered the said two shot Americano straight and an almond biscotti. The Americano was great and provided not only the strength of a great espresso, but also a great rich robust flavor with the kick I needed to make through the rest of the day, but absolutely no bitter after taste. The biscotti came in a small little box, a little over kill for eating in, but it was nice, and it was quite good. it was perfect for dipping in the Americano and had a mild almond flavor and a great crunchy texture, but soaked up that rich Americano rather easily.   They provide plenty of seating inside and outside, including WiFi for those who needed it. Service was top rate and I was even offered a refill. I hope more of these start pooping up around Vegas, better yet, bring some down to San Diego!"}
{"text":"Waaaaaayyyyy better than Starbucks, or pretty much anywhere else I've been in Vegas. My fiancee and I always follow the crowd to Starbucks, mainly because there's one on every street corner, but he said he'd had this place before, and wanted me to try it. Soooooo glad I did! Came here today, Monday, 8-14-17, 1pm.  Atmosphere is clean, cozy, and inviting.   The barista, young girl, didn't catch her name, was incredibly friendly. I mentioned I had never been there and she offered me recommendations.   Due to current diet restrictions, I ended up with a double espresso over ice, and he got a latte. Coolest thing, she served his latte with a heart shape with the foam on top.   The espresso itself was delicious! Not bitter, like others I've had. The quality seems very high. They even have a self help bar offering cups of water. Just quality all the way in every aspect. Can't wait to come back and try different menu items! Our new go-to place!!"}
{"text":"Their WiFi sucks. Worse than a 56k dial up speed. I can't believe they would offer a speed this slow to their customers. I wouldn't recommend coming here if you need internet for getting work done / studying."}
{"text":"I been this location many times but today was last day . I mean I never got good experience with this location never ....  I just got late pay $5 cash. After I gave her money I gave my point card she was I can do nothing... really?? I was give me back my $5 cash and do that again ..."}
{"text":"Nice!  At least I could find a seat! :)  Good coffee, nice to see their expansion into more locations.  Beans are good.  Iced coffee good. Internet good.  Music good.  People not super loud at this moment.  Good mix of people Han style (solo) and in groups.  Parking not a problem.  Stamp of approval!"}
{"text":"Super yummy. Great service. Comparable prices. Easy to get to. Great ambiance.  On point all around. Love this spot!"}
{"text":"This Sambalatte is smaller than its partner store in summerlin. It is a great shop to sit at the window seats and look at the strip and work on a really cool wooden countertop. The coffee is not the greatest in the area but it is definitely better than anything you get at a chain coffeeshop. Overall, great place to sit outside and do some hw at their table (which has outlets) and drink some good coffee."}
{"text":"This place was awesome! You cannot miss this place as it is just north of the 215 right off of the Jones exit. The name written on the building is huge. In case you are wondering if you are late for work, they also gave a massive clock on the outside of the building as well.   We came in specifically for pastries. I saw a few small quiches and some muffins. But when I saw the cherry danish, the decision was made. My husband got a coffee, and we took these to go. They have a great condiment bar with a nice creamer machine. This place was very comfortable.   The danish was excellent. Lots of cherry filling, and just the perfect amount of sweet for the morning. There is a drive through here as well. This place is really nice."}
{"text":"Located right off the highway, it is in a mini strip mall with plenty of parking along with a drive-thru.  We went inside and the first impression is reminiscent of a large chain cafe rather than a small independent roaster and coffeehouse.  However, you can see little details that make it distinctive: vintage coffee grinders, single origin beans, wood tables, and then the steampunk machine.  I chose a Brazilian for my steampunk and it was worth the extra cost.  Clean and clear flavor notes came through easily in their ceramic mugs with saucer.  My wife had her nutella latte with real nutella that was a little sweet.  Overall, a very good place for high quality coffee whether you enjoy the indoor seating or outdoor environment."}
{"text":"Yummy almond croissant and Nutella latte. Love the outdoor area and background music. Perfect for relaxing and getting your caffeine fix."}
{"text":"Hands down, the absolute best coffee in town! The drive thru makes it very convenient.  My go to drink is the Vanilla Latte. Always made perfectly. Upon a suggestion from a friend, I  tried the Nutella Latte and it is addicting it is so good.  I wish we had a Sambalatte near Anthem!"}
{"text":"I didn't get as much of a wow factor walking in as I did in the original location, but it's still a great spot to hang out.  Plenty of seating all around, especially outdoors. For the laptop campers, there's a few outlets spread out throughout the place, but not super plentiful. No huge co-working table in this location too. I really liked working on that table in the original location.  Coffee is still great (my favorite is the flat white) and I'm always served happily. Another good spot to get caffeinated on the southwest part of Vegas."}
{"text":"Uff! I was super excited to hear they'd be opening a Sambalatte literally a mile from my house. I really like the. Boca Park location with it's plush sofas and live music in the evenings. But it is a bot far from my house for me to go regularly and I prefer to avoid. Summerlin crowds if possible.   I came last week around 6ish and ordered a small cafe con leche. It was $3 dollars exactly and the barista kindly asked me if I needed the wifi connection, which I thought was extremely nice since most places are stingy about it. The code appears on your receipt. That new to me!  Anyway, I sat around waiting, perusing the local mags while my coffee was made. They have a little section in the back with a booth-like area, but I chose one of the cafe tables up front. They also have a a countertop with stools facing outside. They had some music on that wasn't too too loud. As far as ambiance and seating goes, I don't know if I LOVE it for getting work done. But it's great for catching up with friends or light reading.  The coffee was perfect. Truly. I don't know what they do to it, it feels so rich and creamy, I mean I must have consumed 1000 calories right? Actually no. But that's how delicious it is. In my book, if you are on this side of town, it makes no sense to get coffee elsewhere."}
{"text":"Staff is great and the coffee is just GOOD. Nothing ever tastes bland, burnt or gritty... Yep, I've experienced all those at other coffee shops and-- YUCK! Not here though, all around great experience.   My go-to drink to \"test\" out new places is a white chocolate mocha and theirs has got to be my favorite in town. I wish they had a sugar-free option for everything but they only have SF for certain drinks, understandable but luckily the sweetener in my drink doesn't affect me as say like... Starbucks :)  There's a shaded sitting area outside, will be nice to hangout for our brief \"spring\" weather that we get here in the desert."}
{"text":"Went from a nice good tasting coffee shop to a terrible amateurish badly roasted coffee shop.  Even a bad Starbucks has better coffee now.  And that's sad because the staff are great. :("}
{"text":"There are three Sambalatte location in Las Vegas: the address on this yelp page, Monte Carlo Casino and Hotel, and Boca-Park.  I've been to this location and the Monet Carlo location and the interior is a nice hipster vibe to it.  It's a nice place to chat with friend and drink coffee together.  They have the Rainbow Latte, which is a secret menu.  It's a nice drink; a little bit bitter if you're not a fan of coffee, but you can sugar to sweeten it.  I also had their Chai Tea Latte, it was a delicious drink.  I was a little disappointed because I thought I would have a nice artwork on top, but I guess I needed to order a drink that needs creme.  The Chai Tea was warms up your thirst with the right amount of cinnamon to the drink.    My friend ordered their Green Tea Latte, it had a nice creamy texture, but it almost smelled a bit like seaweed.  You can tell it was a bit burnt, but still tasted good.  The staff was helpful and nice at this location. I really liked their mugs. The cup was a large size that my Chai Tea Latte arrived in."}
{"text":"With three locations in Vegas, this Sambalatte is just as good as the others and has its own personality. It is a lot smaller than their 2 story flagship location in Summerlin, however there are still plenty of tables to chat or study. With it being so small, it can get a little hard to study with how loud it gets if you're easily distracted. It's also a little cramped with their small 2 person circular tables and the window bar being so small. If you're trying to spread out multiple textbooks and your laptop, I would go somewhere else.  They also have awesome seating on their small patio that is perfect for a warm day (complete with doggie water dishes!) It's covered and has a Tropical smoothie next door for the kiddies.  They are well known for their nutella latte (which I really don't like) and their photogenic rainbow latte.  There's a drive through and with it being so close to the freeway, it's a perfect spot to stop by."}
{"text":"Very nice ambiance, baristas were super friendly as well. The place is spacious, plenty of chairs outside as well if you want to stay out. I had salmon quiche, it's good but its a little dry. Its not salty so thats good for me ;)  Their matcha green tea latte was good as well, although since I like cold drinks better, this might've been yummier with ice."}
{"text":"Sambalatte on South Jones is a convenient location right off the 215 freeway. They offer an outside patio as well as indoor seating. They also offer a variety of pastries, as well as a chiller with sandwiches and cold drinks to go. Their lattes taste very smooth compared to other coffee shops I have been to. I like their wide variety of flavored lattes such as rose petal, lavender, peppermint and so forth. The people at the counter offered friendly customer service.  Next time you are there ask for their rainbow latte."}
{"text":"Received a very good customer service at the drive through this morning, on my way to work. The ice coffee was okay it was too sweet for me. The almond croissant was soo good!! It was huge too! The filling was bomb! I would totally recommend it and get it again and again.  Lol"}
{"text":"My new favorite tea/coffee spot! Service was exceptional, not pretentious like some coffee places I've been to. They put all loose leaf tea in a press and have steampunk coffee as well!! I ordered the Pear Tree Green tea with an almond biscotti and it was yummy!! Boyfriend ordered a spanish style steampunk coffee said it was great!! Ambiance is quite and quaint with nice touches throughout!! Def will be going back!!"}
{"text":"This is the one and only time I will come here.   The worker at the register didn't know how to take any orders and the regulars had to correct him so they were not over charged.  When I went to pick up my tea the worker did not want to give me the ice I asked for as it would not taste right.  It's my tea and I know how I like it."}
{"text":"Hands down - the worst service I have ever received!!  How does a business who treats their customers so poorly stay in business?  I was meeting a friend here for a quick coffee and chat.  I went up to order our drinks.  When it was my turn, I walked up to the cashier and said \"hello\"...  nothing from her.  I was a bit perplexed.  I then said \"how are you?\"  I got a response out of her but it was definitely a day that she didn't want to be there.  I ordered a iced soy latte (my friend's drink).  She was annoyed that I didn't give her the size.  I asked her what sizes they have...  she just points at the sample cups that are infront of the register.  I told her the largest size they have.  Then I order my drink which was a non fat rainbow latte.  Again, I didn't give her the size of the drink and she was again annoyed.  I told her the largest size.  I gave her my card - wanting to end this interaction with the grumpy cashier as quickly as possible.  She asked if I wanted a receipt.  I told her yes.  I waited, waited... no receipt.  I asked her then for a receipt.  She had to explain to me that it takes so much time to print and it prints a huge receipt.  I really don't need the explanation - just need the receipt.  Then, I moved over to where we pick up the drinks.  She then begins to complain to the other barista how much work a rainbow latte is when it is ordered with non-fat milk.  At that point, I was ready to leave, however, didn't want to leave my friend so I asked the cashier if I could just get a bottle of water instead of the coffee.  She said that they don't have bottles of water - and she said it in a manner where she was acting like I was stupid for asking that.  The other barista ended up making the drink.  I will NEVER be back at this shop...  Horrible and rude service!"}
{"text":"I love their green tea latte and macarons.  This is a good place to meet with a friend, read a book, and study.  There are a few items in the lunch menu such as sandwiches and desserts.  It can get busy inside, but there is plenty of seating outside.  I will be coming back to try their other drinks."}
{"text":"Needed a quick caffeine fix so I yelped the closest place to me.  Sambalatte was the winner and it wasn't a disappointment either.  I decided on a hot Matcha latte and it was beautifully made. Also ordered a veggie quiche which also was fantastic.  I honestly will be back to try more of there selections."}
{"text":"Staff is super friendly and it is a nice and cozy environment, but the heat on in 70+ degree whether makes it difficult to enjoy. I ordered a sandwhich that was soggy, but there weren't any options other than pastries or sweets. They have a large selection of drinks, but I wish they would have more sugar free options rather than just hazelnut and vanilla."}
{"text":"I've been coming to sambalatte for several years and have seen them expand. They've only improved since my first visit (although I've always loved them).   As you enter they have in door and outdoor seating. All sorts of table tops from community tables, 2 tops, 3 tops, and corner table, couches, and plugs everywhere. They set it up so that you can both socialize with friends you meet for coffee, to taking a nice study time to yourself. I love that the rampart summerlin location has an upstairs that over looks the coffee lounge.  I'm a huge coffee nerd and love how they have the pour over in front of everyone where they pick up their coffee. I spoke to the barista making it and he said that when you order it that way it brings out more flavors, which he's 100% right! The baristas are experience and I know this because they certainly pass the Cappuccino test.   I love the selection of pastries as well. They have traditional, fancy, healthy salads and fruits, and sweets/desserts. They think about everyone and makes sure that anyone with any diet can come in and enjoy a nice breakfast or snack. It would be pretty embarrassing if you went somewhere to meet a friend and didn't offer something for both people's diets.   The look inside is very comfortable and inviting. I love everything about this place. The owners knew EXACTLY what they were doing when they opened Sambalatte. :)"}
{"text":"Thanks to in-the-know Las Vegans, I was introduced to this cafe loved by all the locals. It has everything you want from a coffee shop: coffee, tea, food, lots of indoor and outdoor seating, clean bathrooms, wifi, and even plenty of outlets for laptop users.   Not so much in the coffee mood, I had two iced teas and a packaged Greek salad. I liked one iced tea more than the other, but they both came in large glasses to keep me refreshed for a long time. The salad was surprisingly fresh and tasty for sitting in a fridge. It was great to have a healthier alternative than the usual scones and cookies (which they have plenty of as well).   Most impressive to me was the friendly service. The people who work there are happy to make suggestions, give you the wifi code, and won't give you the stink eye if you stay there a while.   A great spot if you're in the area and want a place to hang!"}
{"text":"Ask me a year ago and Sambalatte would have 5 stars, hands down. However, this location seems to have gone a little downhill in recent months. Service and speed of delivery are still decent. However, my white mocha latte today was not. It tasted watered down and unsatisfying. Maybe it was just an off day.. but with all the craft coffee places opening up around town, a Las Vegas staple should not drop the ball given its increase in competition.   I usually go through the drive through in the mornings but today decided to drop by since The Donut Bar was having a pop up shop. This was pretty cool. Hope to see them partnering more in efforts like this. It'll give me more motivation to come back. That and the rainbow lattes which I have yet to try. Will update when I come back.."}
{"text":"Obsessed with the Nutella Capp. Perfect amount of sweet and adequate amount of caffeine!! Buzzzzzz....."}
{"text":"I recently moved here from the Seattle area and found the Las Vegas coffee scene disappointing/nonexistent. The  tables at the Starbucks near my apartment here seem to be a gathering place for the deranged and homeless. Anyway, I am very happy to have been showed Sambalatte. I love the atmosphere, and of course, the signature Nutella Latt√©. I am a straight black coffee kind of person, so I thought the latte would be too sweet, but lo and behold, it's just perfect."}
{"text":"This place was alright. Nothing too fancy and the coffee was mediocre. The prices were high and the vibe was trying too hard to be hipster friendly. Not a fan, and would only go back if I was too lazy to drive to Madhouse coffee. overall, I gave it three stars only because of the effort they put in to trying to be an environmentally conscious small business and because the people seemed nice."}
{"text":"A great feel to the atmosphere. Great for meeting a business partner at a semi-casual coffee shop, meeting your best friends or just studying. Must try a stream punk coffee. My favorite is the Brazilian."}
{"text":"This location is super convenient! I wanted to sit and have a cup of coffee and a pastry and I had wanted to try Sambalatte forever so I drove down the street and fortunately it wasn't super busy! I like how they have a flow for ordering instead of a long line down the middle of the restaurant  *cough sbux cough* the line is headed away from the sitting area. They have a ton of delectable pastries, desserts, and macarons. I saw/heard a crazy coffee brewing contraption so I asked a few questions about it and decided on a cup of Ethiopian and a blueberry muffin.   The coffee wasn't super strong I used a little bit of sugar in the raw and it was good! The blueberry muffin was out of this world though! Perfect crunchy top, berries studded the tasty cake, and it was HUGE. I highly recommend you try it!   My hubby loves sweets so I got him a Nutella latte and a double chocolate muffin. The flavor of Nutella was faint. The muffin again was delicious. I prefer the blueberry though!"}
{"text":"Stellar coffee, tea, and treats are found inside this fabulous coffee shop. I love the Summerlin location and I was worried that this location would get lost in translation and be a secondary, knock-off version. I was wrong. It superseded my expectations and more. Now there is a drive-thru and spacious seating. Parking is abundant and there's always seating. A great place to meet with friends or to have a low-key, casual date."}
{"text":"????????????????????????????????????????? Starbucks  ???????????????????"}
{"text":"I heart this place. Maybe even more than the original location. Plenty of parking and seating to work on the laptop or enjoy a conversation with a friend. The coffee here is delicious. Nutella mochas are to die for! Their baristas know how to delicately steam the milk to a silky smooth lightly frothy consistency and give it that beautiful, signature design on top.   The snacks and sandwiches they offer are delicious as well. Brie and Forest ham baguette is music to my palate and the decadent choco desserts even more so."}
{"text":"Great coffee. Comfortable working area. Good food. I really like the outside seating. Dog water dish nice touch. Quality food."}
{"text":"I have never been to the one in the Summerlin area so this review will be completely unbiased (although I am planning on going there one of these days).   I have never tasted the Nutella cappuccino but my god, the one I ordered definitely did not taste like Nutella whatsoever. Not even a hint. It just tasted like black coffee with milky froth added to the top. I like black coffee but I ordered a Nutella cappuccino so I expected to at least taste some Nutella! So that's one star off of my rating.   Certain drinks also come in one size so that's a bit of a down side for me. Now I repeat that I have never been to the other location so I don't know if they do it there too. There's another star taken off the rating.   Other than that, it's a really chill and laid-back coffee place. I'd most likely be visiting every once in a while to study or have a chat with a friend or have coffee dates with the boyfriend."}
{"text":"Had a lovely early evening coffee and snack with a girlfriend.. what a delight. Staff pleasant, food delicious, company outstanding. Very pleased with this well above the norm Coffee and Expresso bar. I highly recommend them to just chill and have a nice noon to yourself. Will definitely come back"}
{"text":"This is by far the worst coffee I have had in Las Vegas. I would much rather go to an unnamed chain that can at least get my order correct.  I hesitated to try this location due to the poor experience I had in Summerlin a while back, but decided it was worth a shot. Unfortunately, this location was even WORSE! That's saying quite a lot considering there was a cockroach meandering around in their other location.   I ordered a latte made with almond milk. They use Silk almond milk which is both too sweet and subpar to other brands. I would expect more from a $5.50 beverage. I decided to add a flavor and the only sugar free option was vanilla. Seriously? Vanilla as the only sugar free option?   It took almost 10 minutes to get my latte, and when the barista called out my name and order, she mumbled something about extra steamed milk, but nothing about almond milk. After several comments back and forth, it was apparent my drink was made with regular milk. I am allergic to dairy and drinking what was served to me would have been disastrous.  I was finally served a new latte after the girl who took my order incorrectly blamed the mistake on me. Really? Come on... I did not change my order to almond milk at the end. Pretty sure I have a serious allergy and ALWAYS specify this multiple times. When I was given my replacement drink, it lacked the pretty heart design of the first and was not even a proper latte. Sad that the barista can't decipher between a latte and a cafe au lait.   Despite its dismal appearance, I took the drink and sat outside. The drink was like being punched in the face by a diet vanilla cola. Syrupy sweet and absolutely disgusting. I could not bring myself to drink it, so I went back for one final try. This was a bad move.   To make matters even worse, the mug that was set aside for their third attempt at my drink ended up getting remnants of another persons order spilled in it. Did they clean it out? No!! After all the fuss I made about my severe dairy allergy, they left what spilled from another persons coffee with milk in the bottom of my cup. They didn't even wipe off the side!   When questioned about the mishap, the baristas looked at me like I was speaking another language. I ended up throwing in the towel and getting a refund. Do not go here unless you want an overpriced black coffee."}
{"text":"Sip, Savour, & Socialize:     Sambalatte is a popular Las Vegas Coffee lounge with hot caffeineated drinks and a cool catchphrase : sip, savour, & socialize. Ever since Sambalatte opened their original coffee lounge in Summerlin, Sambalatte is a place that I sip, savour, & socialize in. This is one of three locations that I sip, savour, and socialize in since it opened in 2014.    These days, I have used this as a caffeine stop on the way to Red Rock Canyon, Mount Charleston, and Summerlin area parks. This is a convenient coffee stop on the way to the western periphery of the valley. It is right off the Jones Boulevard exit of the 215 and at the corner of Sunset and Jones. With the new Sunset Road extension, sometimes I take it from Henderson stop off at Sambalatte then get onto the 215 west of the traffic hot spots.    When it comes down to it, I prefer this location as a morning spot where I prefer the Summerlin location as an evening spot. This is more of a laid back location than Summerlin, which is a happening two story flagship lounge with entertainment, a library of magazines, couches, and coffee theatre. The first thing you see walking toward the entrance is a drive thru and Tropical Smoothie next store. There is a patio complete with tables between Sambalatte and Tropical Smoothie. Fronting the door is a Sambalatte bicycle with bags of beans and doggie water bowls. When you walk inside there are the colossal coffee bean bags on display. Once inside the lounge has an industrial feel with black ceiling tiles and colors designed to mimick coffee. The walls are arc shaped with plate glass windows above a counter with stools. Throughout the main area the tables are small. Towards the back by the hall leading to the restrooms there are a couple of decent size tables. Opposite the arc shaped walls is the long counter that includes the pastry cases.     Generally speaking the employees have been friendly. There was one visit where I asked the obvious question, \"Is Sambalatte going to open a store in Henderson?\" Recently, a friendly barista presented me with a complimentary blueberry muffin. She let fall that there was a different promotion for each week of the summer. Then a couple of months ago, a sweet barista volunteered to warm up the rest of my coffee then put it in a to go cup.      I am a fan of Sambalatte coffee. It is flavorful and very strong. The fact that I rarely leave coffee in the medium cup is evidence that this is premium coffee. And the fact that a few minutes after finishing this coffee when I am driving north on the 215 in the Summerlin foothills feeling the caffeine rush through my bloodstream is evidence that this is strong coffee. Sambalatte is much more than just strong and flavorful coffee. They have developed a reputation for their Nutella late. I prefer the more expensive drink for the Summerlin location when I am hanging out in the evening. Speaking of expensive, the coffee here ain't cheap. A medium cup is approximately $3. With that said, the catchphrase could become: \"Sip, Savior, Socialize, & No Free or Discounted Refills.\" The refill is the exact price for a cup of coffee. On account of the fact that the coffee is so good that I could drink it if it becomes slightly cold, I order medium or larger.          Sambalatte continues to be one of the coffee lounges that I visit to sip, savour, & socialize. I hold a high opinion of their coffee and caffeineated drinks. Apparently many others share my opinion. Sambalatte is so popular that they announced a future downtown Las Vegas location that will be built off South Main Street in the Arts District."}
{"text":"Just came by for some macaroons and got 3 almond, 2 pistachios, 1 mango, and 1 coconut. Came out to 12.25 total and they were regular sized not minis. They were all good with the almost pasty like shell on the outside and delicious through out. The almond was awesome and so was the mango. Pistachio just isn't one of those flavors I really love and comparably the mango was phenomenal and the almond was perfect. The coconut was the only one I wasn't really happy about the outside shell had a consistency more like a meringue."}
{"text":"Customer service was below average on my last visit. My girlfriend ordered a soy matcha latte and received one with dairy. After politely asking if I could have one remade with soy milk the barista, Diane, placed blame on us saying that we never specified soy milk. She made it seem like it was a burden to make the correct drink we ordered even though there was no one in line and the place was pretty mellow. After Diane made it the second time I noticed the mug had a couple of dirty marks on the outside. She didn't have to respond in a negative manner. I would have happily paid for a second one. I won't be back (well at least to this location)."}
{"text":"I was actually very happy with this.  The cappuccino was a double shot. So that was solid. I needed it.   The staff was fairly friendly and the place was new and clean.  If I was in the area I would come back for sure."}
{"text":"Matcha Latte w/ Almond Milk ($7): Delicious!! Definitely one of the best matcha lattes I've had. Perhaps it was the almond milk since most places only have soy as a milk alternative. I really enjoyed this beverage and there's SO much of it in one cup!  Almond Croissant ($4.25): This was decent croissant, but far from the best. It was heavily loaded with all the sugar/almond goodness and lacked the crisp of a good croissant. It's also one of the more expensive croissants in town.  Sausage, Egg, and Cheese Muffin ($8): A good sandwich, but WAAY overpriced. I still can't get over how expensive this was and trust me, it wasn't anything special. It was an English muffin, cheese, sausage patty, and premade egg. Like McDonald's.  Quiche Lorraine ($7.75): This quiche was only slightly larger than the sandwich, so it was small. Great flavor, but unfortunately salty.   I'm a little torn about how I feel toward Sambalatte. It's a cool hang out. I like the space (besides the crowded tables in the main area) and the baristas are delightful. My sister and I spent a couple hours here during the afternoon and it was such a pleasant stay.   On one end, I LOVED my Matcha Latte. However, the food was overpriced and disappointing. Are coffee shops not supposed to have good food? I don't know, I don't spend a lot of time in coffee shops. I didn't even have the coffee. I'm pretty sure most people are coming to Sambalatte for the coffee anyway, but just as a precaution, stay away from the food!"}
{"text":"Cute new location! Fun and really nice employees. LOVE that is has a drive through and it's usually pretty quick. Only draw back is that it's kind of small and corded inside. They do make up for that with ample outdoor space though..."}
{"text":"Best dirty chai I've ever had! Very bold in spices and flavor and not overly sweet. Came out the perfect temperature to start drinking right away. Yum!"}
{"text":"Cute little place. Clean, staff is friendly, pretty large menu.. Ordered a hot chocolate and matcha latte."}
{"text":"I finally decided to give this spot a try. I've heard great things about the coffee so for the last couple weeks I've been coming here. Ive tried the mocha frappe and java chip frappe. Java chip is the better one out of the two. I will say the only reason why I give this place 3 stars is because of their coffee. The negatives are it doesn't matter how slow this place is as in customers they are the slowest group of baristas. Usually there are 3 people working and with me just ordering coffee in the drive through or going in it takes about 8-10 min. I've timed it. If there are more than 5 people in the store or 2 in the drive thru expect about a 15min wait. This is where starbucks shines with how on-top of things they are. Also for the last 5 days they were out of the powder they needed to make the frappe's?? What kind of coffee company runs out of products they need to satisfy their menu? Finally returned today they had the powder in yay!! But now their point system was down.. Wow so another customer related issue I can't even get credit for my drink now! Awesome"}
{"text":"Never once have I had anything to complain about here. Staff is always friendly and efficient, coffee is amazing. Great place to sit down and enjoy a gourmet cup of coffee. I always sit outside on the patio. Their pastries are a bit expensive, but that's pretty normal for a coffee shop, right? Overall, love it."}
{"text":"Still my favorite coffee spot. Their house cup of coffee is my favorite. Always a good brew!! Also my favorite location! It gets busy but you can usually find a spot if you're looking to sit."}
{"text":"The nutella iced coffee is pretty amazing. The breakfast options are decent but nothing spectacular. I don't know if I'd come back but it's worth checking out just to try some of their coffee."}
{"text":"This is my favorite location. Even when they get busy, the drinks are still delicious! Francis makes the best drinks and I will no longer drink coffee from anywhere else. The Nutella coffee drink is my current addiction."}
{"text":"Lucky for them the coffee's are great because it's something different from just Starbucks. Unfortunately the barista that work here are HORRIFIC! Lack of training, lack of personality or just lack of common sense. I've had incidences such as the girl forgetting to give me my change and/or card back thru the drive thru. Forgot a straw for an ice drink, or just have lack of interaction with customers. There is never any kind of management on duty to report any kind of unsatisfactory service or complaints. So with that being said, our regular coffee dates at this location has stopped and we have resorted to a different coffee shop."}
{"text":"Place was really chic and cozy. Our iced Nutella latte was just ok, I was expecting \"delish\" but it's not a sweet drink at all for our taste. However, the iced white mocha was really delish  and we bought our kiddos Nutella hot coco, and they're just \"ok\" as well."}
{"text":"Love the coffee. Nice break from *buck's. They make me smile with the pretty designs in my foam. Trance music, comfy seating both in and out side. Overall, a nice interlude. Wifi pretty dependable, as is coffee quality. We tend to be the geezers, but that doesn't matter much."}
{"text":"Super expensive and long wait but the coffee and pastries are delicious!"}
{"text":"try their latte and it is pretty smooth, sitting inside is kind of crowded, they do have outside sitting though"}
{"text":"This place is one of the best places in town for coffee and tea. It's a nice retreat and doesn't feel like Vegas. The patio was gorgeous and the food is really good. Some healthy options, but more so pastries. Not a lot of tea selections, but the ones that they do have are really good. Amazing spot for locals and I'll be back again!"}
{"text":"Great environment. Very friendly staff and they had this Chapstick I wish I would've purchased right on the register stand made by them!"}
{"text":"I had their house coffee and it was really watered down. In fact, it was more like water with a hint of coffee.  The wait was also really long, they seemed to be understaffed during lunch hours."}
{"text":"If you are looking for some place with actual coffee Sambalatte is a great spot. They have a full menu of your standard coffee drinks, but they have a great cold brew too. Plus, the amazing baristas craft not only delicious and very strong tasting lattes they make them works of art. I really dig their food menu as well. They have quiches, cookies and many other enticing items. My favorite thing is their blueberry muffin. It's loaded with blueberries, moist all the way through and not overly sweet. My only criticism would be maybe a little more comfortable seating. I do love the option of sitting outside that they offer. Sambalatte also has a cute set of water dishes outside for doggies.   I love coffee shops and Sambalatte is my go to spot on this side of town. I'm always down for one  of their lattes and a blueberry muffin. If you love coffee as much as I do make sure to hit this spot up for a strong cup!"}
{"text":"I'm so glad they opened one on my side of town. Although it's still a little out of the way, I'm willing to drive the distance for a good cup of joe' --especially for their iced Nutella latt√©.   When this place first opened, I was a bit underwhelmed with the timeliness and the customer service.. But I think it was just a matter of settling in with a new staff.  I do appreciate the drive-thru, I am always on the go, so this works in my favor! One thing I wish they could invest in is offering a larger size than that 16oz. I remember, at one point, when I used to go to the Summerlin location, they offered a 24oz. It would be so amazing if they got bigger cups, it's such an inconvenience for me having to order two 16oz lattes every time I'm there. So I pray to the coffee Gods, please add a 24oz cup!"}
{"text":"You did it again Luis. Best coffee in town - this time it's easily accessible and parking is readily available. The wait time is shorter and the new barista from LA that made my coffee was amazing! I can't wait until you are on every corner in America."}
{"text":"Yay!!! I finally can go to the new Samba cause my work is the next building over! I got the egg white frittata and a iced green tea. Everything came out super fast, and it wasn't crazy crowded like the summerlin location. Everything tasted amazing but stilllllll pretty pricey. Can't blame quality ;) I will be back.... Well probably everyday haha."}
{"text":"I jumped in joy when I saw this place opened up not too far away from my house! I agree with a previous yelp reviewer the taste is true to the original. The real treasure is the ambiance and customer service. The workers are so nice and welcoming, that you almost want to love their drinks. The ambiance is amazing but inside and outside, they do have music playing inside not really outside. It's a great place to study or talk with a friend if you get here early. Outlets inside are easy to find, not so easy outside unless you're sitting at their big conference like table. I really want to love this place, hopefully I'll find a favorite drink.  I will be coming more!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I walked into this coffee spot today and was not greeted by the lady behind the counter. I waited until she looked at us and without saying \"hello\" or even a smile.. She just blatantly said, \"What's your order?\" After being taken aback by her cold response.. We put in our drink & food order and she didn't even say, \"thank you\" or \"have a good day.\" At that point.. I looked right at her and she  gave us a rude and cold look. I grabbed my receipt and didn't even bother saying, \"thank you.\" We waited at a nearby table for a few minutes.. And normally the barista would announce whatever drinks were ready to pick up at the counter; however, this barista just left it at the counter without saying a word. If it wasn't for my boyfriend who turned around and saw our drink orders.. We would have waited a lot longer. We gave this coffee spot a try.. And I can definitely say that we will never come back and just go further down the road to Starbucks instead.   Aside from the lousy service.. My Nutella cappuccino was not good and the white mocha my boyfriend ordered was extremely sweet. The quiche we ordered was actually good but not worth coming back for their food.   At least over at starbucks.. They acknowledge you and welcome you with a smile. The lady who worked this morning as the barista should take some classes on manners and learn how to be friendlier to paying customers."}
{"text":"Two coffees, both tasted burned, and one was the nitro cold brew... interesting. Bummer, no thank you"}
{"text":"This place as great espresso!  But the last few times I've been here I've had their loose leaf teas.... They put it in a little french press so I can determine how long I wan it to steep, it's really fun:)  I love to come here to read and mess around on my laptop... The best part of this place, I think is the ambiance, although their other location is bigger and has a really cool second story... I like this place location better. There's less distraction.  The staff puts such a positive vibe in the air... And I've only been here 5 time in the past month and they are already recognizing me. I think his is my new \"me day\" spot:)"}
{"text":"Sambalatte Torrefazione is where serious coffee lovers unite!!!  I just love the huge array of coffees they have practically covering every time of the day.  One of the things I noticed that stands out is their steampunk selection. These coffees are strong, ultra smooth and satisfying.  I ordered the Ethiopian Simdamo, I didn't add much sugar and cream because I wanted to taste the natural flavor of the coffee, it had notable citrus accents to it. The chocolate biscotti went well with the coffee.   The chocolate and nutella cappuccinos are amazing, its not too sweet that it overpowers the coffee.   I like the staff that work there they very are cool people, they make the place enjoyable to relax.  My only con is the sandwiches, they didn't taste fresh and a bit pricey. They were shrink wrapped in the refrigerator, maybe mine sat there too long.  I would prefer that they make it in house.  I have no complaints on the baked goods those taste awesome."}
{"text":"My first trip was two years ago and had a five star experience. This time was more businesslike. I know it is a busy location on the strip but it is a cool place to take a break from the fast pace of Vegas. It would have been nice for the steampunk coffee to come in a ceramic cup but they put it in a  to go cup. It is a great cup of coffee, still up there with shops in  SF and  Denver as far as quality. This time it wasn't as great of an experience."}
{"text":"Waited at the drive thru for 5 mins at 7am, when it said they were open and nobody greeted me or was there to take my order. Did not come in a holiday either. Thanks for no coffee, don't have a drive thru!"}
{"text":"Ok so major customer service problem, ordered drinks and ask if they would bring them out to us because we are on the patio, two different people said sure, but after waiting a while one of the servers come out and say your drinks are ready......but doesnt bring them out. The 8$ sausage muffin was cold in the middle. Besides that the choco crossiant was good, sausage muffin tasted good even cold. The nutella coffee does not taste good. The shots are only okay but the nutella only tasted like pumps of hazelnut with no sugar. Also ordered a veggie quiche, it was decent not great, definitely not 7.75$ Total bill for 3 food items and 2 lattes is over $30 with a bonus of horrible customer service. If you really want food not pastry order from trop smoothie and just get subpar coffee from Sambalatte. Save yourself $20."}
{"text":"Great for a rainy day (or any day at that). Service is good and they seemed to be doing very well with the amount of customers. Decoration is very fun and it has a cozy environment."}
{"text":"Ok second visit today...  I have to say, I'm still not impressed.  Today I tried the Nutella cappuccino...easier than yesterday's attempt at a Nutella latte with white chocolate.  $3.75 for a smaller than a \"tall\" other places, and...I can't taste the nutella. I'm sorry, but if I wanted a plain cappuccino, I'd have paid less.  I wanted to taste the nutella.  The staff is still great, and the place is really nice...if I want a cup of regular coffee NOT at home, I'll probably stop by here with my laptop, but...I'd honestly rather drive a little further and go to Grouchy John's."}
{"text":"Classy coffee joint. Expensive, but the frothy hearts in the lattes make it worth it."}
{"text":"Was a fan of the Boca Park location.  Great to have a location nearby now.  Wish the inside seating was a bit bigger but now that the weather is doing well, there is plenty of outdoor patio seating."}
{"text":"Very nice location off the freeway. Iced mocha was very good. The ham and Swiss croissant was amazing. They have a wide variety of macaroons for you folks. I would go back for sure. The decor is what you would see in most coffee houses of this genre."}
{"text":"I have wanted to come have coffee here for awhile now. Parking was very packed. Tiny parking lot compared to the number of businesses here. You're better off parking in the next lot and walking over. The cafe was nice and had a great atmosphere. Friendly staff. The pastries were few and generic. Definitely not the big draw here. But the coffee wasn't as spectacular as I imagined. Very plain. I had a Lavender Latte...couldn't taste the difference between a regular Latte. I was a bit disappointed. I expected more. I bought a bag of dark roast coffee. The dark roast was more acidic and citrus than I expected."}
{"text":"Love this place, only wish they would have the sugar free syrup like the other ones have! also they are missing most of the muffins afternoon,   great, clean, nice people and kids charis"}
{"text":"Love the location, it is easy and quick. The courtyard is lovely. Great place to hang out and enjoy. The inside is beautiful and open.  I tried the steam punk coffee maker and was not impressed. The machine  looks cool and is fun to watch in action.  The reason that I am here is for the coffee,  I don't care if you are the only place that has this fancy machine - I care about the taste.  The coffee: It was weak and not much flavor.  There are no pour-over or french press options, think of this as Sombalatte Express. If you are serious about good coffee go to the original Sombelatte location or  try Sunrise Coffee."}
{"text":"I made a 5 star review on this location 3 years ago, not realizing it was for the Jones location haha.   What I want to say about this location is that it's just too different from the original location to get 5 stars from me. This location is like a convenient Starbucks you stop at on the way to work because they have a drive-thru (which is exactly what I do). It definitely doesn't give off the \"sit and catch up with friends\" coffee house vibe like the Boca Park location does.   I wish they had more food options like the other location. They just have the usual variety of croissants, quiches, muffins, and cold sandwiches they keep in that little fridge section with the bottled beverages."}
{"text":"I came here after having been to their location in Boca Park, and I honestly like that one a lot better.  This one feels small to me - cramped.  I got hot tea, as usual, which is always good at any Sambalatte.  But, I got a container of \"fresh\" fruit, which turned out to have mold in it.  I probably should have said something, but I opted to just throw it out and not come back.  I'm just glad I didn't get sick.  Mold is gross, guys.  Don't keep produce around more than a couple of days, or else more people will run into the same travesty that I did."}
{"text":"Sambalatte has serves some of my favorite Pour Over Coffee in Las Vegas. It's always consistent. This location is much smaller than the Summerlin location so seating can be an issue during busy times of day. I do t go to Sambalatte for the food so I can't comment on that. Also if your a latte lover, the lavender latte is fantastic!"}
{"text":"After seeing the rainbow Lattes on Instagram, I knew I also had to add this photo onto my page.  I chose this location because it was the closest one to the M Resort & Casino.  It was right off of the 215 Fwy.  Pretty cute coffee shop.  The service was ok but the barista did a great job making my rainbow latte.  Sambalatte has 3 coffee shops in Vegas.  I would come back again to try the lavender latte.  It's definitely worth stopping by, especially if you love taking pics of pretty things."}
{"text":"Came here last night with my friend. I ordered the Nutella Latte. It was good but the nutella flavor was very light. Personally speaking, I would have loved to have tasted more nutella. The latte itself was still very good. Decent prices comparable to Starbucks but better in my opinion. Staff was friendly and the place was clean. They also had an outside seating area which we went there since the weather was nice. Would like to come back and try other coffee flavors they have. Very cozy place. Thanks!"}
{"text":"My first time at a Sambalatte...I'm not a huge coffee drinker but this was the best coffee I've ever had. I am a flavored coffee fan so I got The White Chocolate Mocha, yum. If only there were Sambalatte's on every corner like other coffee joints. Staff was friendly and helpful with a first timer. The crowd was a bit odd on this particular Sunday but we were there to socialize with friends, not people watch.  I will definitely go back, probably not as much as I would like."}
{"text":"Friendly staff and great coffee! Would definitely recommend! Visited the drive thru, great service, and speedy service!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately They have great food and coffee But horrible attitude from the employees.  Very very unfortunate"}
{"text":"I love the coffee and pastries here!!! Im a new fan!!!the server also told me about the Sambalatte reward card thank you!!"}
{"text":"Wasn't impressed with the coffee nor the service. We visited after church in Sunday afternoon and the employee took five minutes to come from the back to make two coffees. They were out of iced coffee and their coffee was pretty bitter.  The interior was really nice but the product wasn't up to par. Their prices also higher than Starbucks and other local shops.  I'd skip."}
{"text":"Yes, this place is kind of expensive. Whether or not it's worth it will be up to personal preference. All I can say is that every single thing I have tried here has been outstanding. Iced lattes are perfect, they don't fill the entire glass with ice- you get the size you order, and if you order a flavor, they don't overdo it like most places. The matcha latte is my favorite- they do not skimp on the matcha, and it doesn't taste too creamy or watered down, they actually use real matcha powder. As a tea person and not a coffee person, I can't really speak to the \"notes\" or \"undertones\" of their coffee, but in my limited experience, they make good coffee. The breakfast foods are good- veggie quiche and quiche lorraine are both standard one-person size, it would be great if they came with greens but they're very nice as is. The ham and cheese croissant is fantastic and there is cheese baked into the top of the croissant (!). Lemon coconut scones, macarons, pear croissant and apple turnover are all excellent as well."}
{"text":"On my way to an appt, I decided to stop by.  This is the weirdest tasting latte I have ever had.  Not sure what type of almond milk and/or flavorings they use.  I do not like drinks handed to me without a lid.  What is the purpose to have a customer walk a few feet to get a lid?  I do LOVE their cups.  The heat guard is built in.  Brilliant.  I wont make any effort to try this place again but will swing by if I am near and need coffee."}
{"text":"I have been looking forward to the opening of this cafe for weeks. I am now sad that it is taking up retail space where another, more reasonably priced, coffee shop could be.  If you browse thru the pictures of pretty lattes with fun designs and an oh-so-flirty feel about them, you will also come across mine. It is the one that has my very boring cup standing next to an iPhone 5. I did this to give you a real sense of my shock when I handed over my card to the tune of $6.42, Yes, $6.42 plus tax, for one measly chai espresso. This awkward concoction was bought at the recommendation of the very helpful and friendly barista. It is because of her I am giving 3 stars. If it were based on price alone I would be demanding a negative star rating. As you can imagine, now that the shock has worn off a bit, I am still feeling just a tad violated.  On a side note, the almond macaroon was delightful (this was not included in the $6.42 price, just so we are clear). So, I suppose not all is lost. Just be careful when you pick your poison here. You may end blowing your week's coffee budget in one fail swoop."}
{"text":"super super love this coffee shop! if you are looking for a good morning boost u must come  here and get your caffeine! i always look for a good crema on espresso and on my latte. ENOUGH SAID. love it."}
{"text":"This one star is 100% for the service (as sambalatte and general is our favorite place to get coffee)  My husband and I generally go to the Boca Park location for date nights and enjoy to walk around a little bit. But this location is much closer to our home. It has been about one year since I came to this location for the first time and I was so unimpressed with the barista's and their attitude that I have not gone back for about a year.  I have been two times in the last month and both times have been treated so poorly that I had to leave a review.   One of the times I ordered mine and my daughters drinks and they came in a (to go cup we were never asked if we wanted to have it here or to go) I then asked if they would give it to me in a here cup and she rolled her eyes and told me it will be cold by the time we transfer it (my first thought was the make me a new one) she then made my drink and I hear cup and told me she had no more clean for my daughters. $15 for coffee I expect that you could wash the cup.   We love their coffee but not this location seems like in a year enough people probably have stopped going further them to realize that they need to change their customer service.  No one had name tag so there was no way for me to take a name down"}
{"text":"Since I now work near this location I do stop here frequently for some morning joe...wish they would have kept packaging cold brew but been using driving thru to get lattes lately..."}
{"text":"Came here to get our coffee fix on.   I came in and stood by the counter when I was finally greeted 30 seconds later.    The guy originally seemed like he didn't want to be there.   But he finally greeted me and my wife.  I asked what was the red rock latte.    He said it was hazelnut and cinnamon.  I got the 12 oz red rock latte and my wife got the 16oz rose latte.     We got our drinks and I took the first sip of mine.   All I tasted was the cinnamon.    They must have sprinkled the cinnamon on top of the drink.    They should mix it in so your first sip is not cinnamon.     The other part I don't get is how did my 12oz red rock latte cost the same as my wife's 16oz rose latte??   They charge separate for the latte and the added flavor at this place is confusing(see receipt photo). I would not come back.    5.75 for my 12oz latte is a little much.   And the flavor is not there.    I did try my wife's rose latte.   That was super good!!!"}
{"text":"So I love coffee. I know good coffee when I taste it and this pace makes an excellent cup of coffee. However, it is so pricey I could never justify forking out that kind of money for a cup of coffee everyday.   This is a great place to come and \"treat yo' self\" to coffee but not my everyday coffee stop.   Enjoy the spring weather in their outdoor seating area or gather a bunch of friends for a meeting or studying."}
{"text":"Really nice coffee place. I have been to both locations but go to the one on Jones Blvd a little more since it is closer to where I live. They have a very good selection of coffee, teas, lattes, hot, cold, and blended drinks as well as various pastries and other small foods. The past few times I have gone there I have ordered their Tahitian Vanilla blended drink. It's really good. Since this location is set more in a commercial/industrial area, there seems to be a lot more business professionals who frequent this place. The seating inside is adequate with additional seating provided outside and WIFI access is present. There is a drive-thru available and the baristas are friendly whenever I have been there."}
{"text":"Pretty much the same vibe as the original Sambalatte but less crowded with rich people. The location is perfect for me (I could walk here from home) and I've always wanted a convenient study location.  That being said, I tend to study at night and this place closes SO EARLY. I was surprised when I had to leave 30 minutes after arriving! I should have checked the hours, though. The drinks are on par with the original, as well as the prices and service. I think the service here is actually better because employees don't have to rush orders.  For some reason, this place draws in incredibly friendly and polite customers as well. I love it! Great little place to study or catch up with friends or just have your morning coffee on the way to work (there's a drive-thru). Convenient location by the 215 as well.  One strange thing I noticed was that there was absolutely no music playing the entire time I was there...Conversation filled the air but it was still silent at times. Is this normal at the original location as well? I honestly never noticed because that place is always bustling with people.  In any case, I'll probably go back soon if I need some intense studying during the day."}
{"text":"This coffee is so amazing but it really sucks that every single time I use the drive thru my order gets messed up. One time they never answered the intercom so I went to the window to order after waiting 15 minutes. Multiple other times I ordered and came to the window and they said I'm sorry I didn't get your order can you tell me again also after waiting 15 minutes. It really sucks because I love this coffee but it has forced me to go to Starbucks"}
{"text":"Soooo here I am getting coffee in the drive thru, waiting for her to take my order. I can hear her giving the car in front of me their change so I wait for her to come to me & this girl has the nerve to start talking crap.  \"Is she still looking at the menu? Does she not know how to order ughhhh do you have pumpkin\"(in a stupid voice) mind you I haven't said anything , and she doesn't know I can hear her . So I go excuse me I can hear you she's like ohhhh I'm sorry. I order my stuff , she's so embarrassed when I get to the window & I told her nobody took my order so no I wasn't staring at your menu thinking & not knowing how to order coffee . She's red saying I'm sorry I didn't know the mic was on & thought someone asked you already . Your coffee is on us today ! She even has someone else give it to me so embarrassed! Thanks for free coffee, however does not give you the right to talk about people even if you think your mic is off. You should be ashamed , I will never get my coffee from you again. I can not support shops who talk about the people who keep their store in business. *signed the girl you talked about this morning in the black SUV"}
{"text":"Of the three sambalatte locations this is my least favorite place. It feels more like a Starbucks in terms of its location and design. It also lacks comfier seats. The latte is solid and the service is friendly, but I would definitely rather be at either of their other locations."}
{"text":"Not only was this place connected to the Monte Carlo, but they had great reviews!  I read an article on the hotel's site that mentioned the limited availability of their Rainbow Latte which was an immediate seller for my girlfriend, who childishly loves everything rainbow or watercolor - no judgement, but she's 26. Anyway, not only was the staff friendly but our beautiful vanilla lattes were delicious as well. After spending our morning on the coffee shop patio, we took our mugs back into the shop to be considerate of their service, and the employee was so grateful for our small gesture. We would love to come back when we're visiting Sin City next time!"}
{"text":"Tried the other location since we were in that part of town and had 3 hours to kill.  There were couple-3 tables available when we got there (mid-afternoon), and by the time we left it fluctuated from couple to none throughout.  So, constantly busy.  The Americano was fabulous - and I mean really tasty - and still love that they have AC outlets EVERYWHERE.  Even the couple picnic tables outside had outlets attached to them!    The only complaint I have are the seats.  They are not comfortable.  In some ways I think this is brilliant, so that people don't sit (like we did) for hours-on-end after a $7 order.  We sat for about 2.5 hours, and came away with back aches and sore butts.  That's what we get for squatting though, so not taking any stars away for that.  Sambalatte will remain our go-to coffee spot."}
{"text":"Thank you Sambalatte for offering drive-thru service at Jones/215. Please offer ORGANIC drinks and food as well as more GLUTEN-FREE options. Thank you. We'll be back, but we're hoping for a different selection."}
{"text":"My fav coffee in town!!! I don't what beans do they use but it taste soooo good!! Left 1 star out cuz it's really expensive!!"}
{"text":"Cute local coffee house. I ordered the Nutella latte as everyone on yelp had suggested. It was delicious - not too sweet, a little nutty, and perfectly chocolatey. The interior is very clean and well decorated. The baristas were very friendly and quick service. There were cute dog bowls outside, so I'll have to come back and stalk some cute pups next time!"}
{"text":"Haven't had sambalatte in awhile and decided to stop by and roll thru the drive thru. The drive thru wasn't busy at all, as I was the only car. I couldn't hear the girl taking my order and she definitely couldn't hear me as I repeated my drink 5 times. Finally she got my drink, but then I waited for the total and she starts speaking to a customer but had her headset turned on. When I asked her if I can pull up to the window she asked if I had ordered something and I said yes. 5 minutes later she says to pull up. I ordered a simple vanilla latte, but there wasn't vanilla in there, but of course I was charged extra. I love sambalatte, especially the one in Boca Park, but this sambalatte wasn't good at all."}
{"text":"Amazing coffee and lattes! The blueberry muffin is a must! Also a great place to sit and relax, pet friendly as well."}
{"text":"I suppose the most important thing to focus on when attempting to duplicate a successful business is making sure the quality of product translates. They succeeded in this...... But somehow for me.... It isn't quite enough.  This location will be a HIT with people who have never heard of or visited the boca park location. I however will only go when I'm in the area.... And let's be honest, it's spring Valley.... I'm never just \"in\" the area.  I will however continue to frequent the original location. Some perspective on my rant for you.... The original location has all the charm and charisma of a real hipster, trendy coffee shop in NYC. No windows, loud music and loungers. This new location is a converted Starbucks, lots of windows and a DRINK fridge sitting in the middle of the place like a 711. Maybe it's just me, but all the light really makes me take notice of the wretched uniforms they had these folks wearing..... Does the original location have that? I'm not sure and I don't pay attention because  they REALLY know their coffee stuff and by all accounts have the same level of adoration for these drinks that I do! I know there is another one scheduled to open at the mirage..... It's just my fervent hope that these chains don't water down the character and atmosphere of the coffee house I have grown to love so much."}
{"text":"Not only are these lattes bright, beautiful and unique every time, they are the most delicious lattes I think I have ever had! I was here for a work trip and my coworker and I came out of the way to try this spot and when we did, we went out of our way a second time just to get another one the next day....They are that good! We tried the Rose and Lavender lattes and trust me, you will not be disappointed. **FOLLOW MY FOOD INSTAGRAM: @LinnysLunchbox"}
{"text":"Coffee is good. Service is slow and horrible. Usually takes 2 tries to get an order right."}
{"text":"When it comes to coffee Sambalatte gets it right! From the moment you pull up and see the bike with coffee bean bags on it you know it is special... From there you enter a calm soothing environment great for relaxing, studying, meetings, and most important enjoying your coffee. The baristas always put a special touch of design on top every drink and the smell is awesome! Enjoy your coffee!"}
{"text":"I am really excited that Sambalatte opened a second location in town and can't wait of their third on the Strip! So let me just say, this location isn't really convenient for me during the week but, during the weekends in the spring you will now find me sitting outside in the courtyard, sipping a nutella latte.  This location still in the process of getting the kinks worked out (the other day it took about 20 minutes to get two lattes, as some guy grabbed the wrong drink and screwed up the barista) but when they get it all done it should be amazing. This location is also going to have a drivethru, (it's already installed, just not being utilized yet) which will be totally convenient for early morning coffee on trips out of town as it's right off the 215 and Jones.  Go check it out if you like really smooth unburnt tasting coffee"}
{"text":"I love studying in coffee shops, so the three things I want most out of a coffee shop is good coffee (duh), decent snacks, and plenty of outlets. And Samba has it all!  The coffee here is good. They have a wide selection of beans and brew methods for all you coffee snobs out there. But if you're coming here for the steampunk, beware that it is almost always broken, and you'll have to settle for a pour over (which is still awesome).  If you like espresso drinks, be mindful that one shot here is actually a double shot. Which means drink the americanos here slowly, because when they say double, that means quad. My favorite is the lavender latte, it's definitely the best I've ever had!  As for their other drinks, they have amazing teas here, served in super cute French presses! The smoothies are good, but it's also right next door to a Tropical Smoothie. They also have spritzers/sparklers which are basically house made soda that are very meh. I would definitely stick with coffee and tea here.  I think most of their pastries are okay for the price. But I love the biscottis, and they have good macarons at average prices. Plus, some of the baristas here are super friendly and knowledgeable about the menu which is always awesome.   Overall, I definitely recommend this place if you want to catch up with friends or get some work done. It's not as cool as their other location, being one story and no live music and all, but it is less busy and you still get quality coffee, tea, and pastries for the same prices at Starbucks."}
{"text":"A bit over priced, and usually a bit of a wait for your order.... the coffee is alright but the pastries are delicious!"}
{"text":"The only thing I like about this place is their macaroons. But then again, they're pretty expensive. $1.75 for the mini ones........"}
{"text":"My favorite coffee spot in Vegas !! Best Nutella Latte. The staff is very friendly. Their almond croissant is one of my fav items."}
{"text":"Always great service my favorite coffee I love the butterscotch latte when in season. Quality is amazing locations are great"}
{"text":"Went here on 2/3/17 during my Vegas vacation on a stroll through the Strip. I gotta say, I loved it. The decor was nice and welcoming, they had random donated board games I wish I had time to try, and their pumpkin spice latte was honestly the best pumpkin latte I've ever had from a coffee place, no contest! I'll definitely come back here the next time I'm in Vegas.  This doesn't affect the review at all, but I never would have thought streetwalkers would be out so early in the evening but my friend and I saw them everywhere while we were walking down the Strip between 4-5, and it was interesting and bizarre seeing a streetwalker on the corner of Sambalatte :P"}
{"text":"I'm not much of a coffee drinker, but on the rare occasion that I am in need of a caffeine fix, drive-thru is always my preferred method. Having this option in the area is nice, but I didn't love the drinks.   Service was friendly, albeit a little slow for there being no line. My iced coffee was a little watered down and I wish they had used more ice to keep it colder. It all seemed to have melted quickly and was lukewarm, which isn't particularly appetizing.   For a quick morning jolt, this is a good option, but I don't see it becoming my go-to coffee spot."}
{"text":"Worth the 25 minute drive every time . Try and go early if you love pastries because they sell out of macarons . Nutella Latte is my favorite but the green tea is wonderful as well . Not as big as the original location in Boca Park , but plenty of parking and a drive thru !"}
