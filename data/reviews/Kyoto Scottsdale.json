{"text":"Great food!!! Our bartender Erik took care of my fiance and I very well.  Great atmosphere and prices!!!  We highly recommend this restaurant!!!"}
{"text":"Greatest sushi find in Scottsdale. Pricing is unbelievable not even taking into account the great location. Nigiri orders $3 for two pieces?  Where do you see that?  Quality is awesome and the staff is great. Atmosphere is...well let's just say retro and if you see it with those eyes your gonna walk out with a five star experience. 

I'm so sick of walking out of sushi places feeling like I've just been taken advantage of. You will never walk out of Kyota with that in mind. And the have teppen yaki tables too!  Maybe next time, but as for now I just keep going in for the sushi."}
{"text":"I eat lunch here 3-4 times a month. The prices for their lunch specials are fantastic. I usually get a chicken teriyaki bowl, along with a sushi roll, and the total is about $7. I've had a variety of their sushi, and it's all been great."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite local sushi joints! For a fresh and inexpensive sushi meal they can't be beat. Great service, great sushi, always fresh and really great prices. A wonderful neighborhood sushi joint."}
{"text":"Me, wife and daughter came here for my daughters birthday. We called in advance to see if we needed reservations. In which we did so I made a reservation for three letting them now that it was for a birthday. They asked for the birthday girls name and age. 
When we arrived we were pleasantly meet by a host and the general manager, I believe his name was Daniel an older gentleman with a cane. He explained to us the parking situation since they had no valet driver but had signs stating only valet parking.
After being sat at the end of the table not the middle since there was no one else joining our teppanyaki  table (keep in mine there were only two other tables in the restaurant a three top and a five top both being birth days. The host started off with our drinks and said our server would be with us shortly. After about 15 min. Our server came by to take our order which we ordered the tuna ta taki,edimami and the crazy roll. Once the edimami hit the table we place our order for the teppenaki order for the filet, my strip and scallops and the chicken. Half way through our main meal my wife's sushi roll arrives and I ask to see how long on my tuna tataki was going to be, but she said she forgot to put it in and if I would like her to. I told her that it would be fine since my steak was just about done. The teppanyaki chef was definitely green and still learning which was fine he was still very entertaining and even acknowledged my daughters birth day and was the best part of the meal. The food was ok very very very over priced for what you get compared to other teppanyaki After he was done and we were eating our meals our server was no ware to be found along with the rest of the servers. I ended up walking to the host stand to see if we could get some refills on our drinks and the host was very friendly and proceeded to get our drink order and refills. Our server finely came out from the back 45 min. Later to just drop off the check. The other two tables they came out and sang to the birthday people but did not for my daughter even though they were aware of her birthday."}
{"text":"I found this place serendipitously when I was strolling around, looking for a place to eat dinner with mom after ArtBridge Thursday. We sat at a bar where a chef made food right in front of us quietly. We chose more authentic style dishes like simple sushi and rolls without \"fried and smothered in mayo crap.\" They were not shy with ingredients, and I thought their food was delicious."}
{"text":"Came in for dinner with a party of 10. Booked a reservation last minute and unfortunately did not read the reviews fully. Not impressed. The first problem was when we asked for the sushi to come out as appetizers and our server condescending told us that they can try but it \"depends on how backed up the sushi guys are\". That's an actual direct quote. This server was not attentive, constantly darting away from the table before we could ask for drinks, silverware, etc. The beef bullion soup that comes at the beginning of the meal tasted like they put sliced mushrooms in a bowl of ramen broth. No complaints about teppanyaki chef, but one of the tricks resulted in an actual ball of fire igniting startlingly close to the head of the four year old at the table (this is no exaggeration as we have it recorded on video). Other off putting things about this restaurant include a $7.00 up charge for fried rice and miso soup instead of the ramen broth and steamed rice it came with, crazy loud customers at other tables, bussers and food runners who literally put down plates of food hanging off of the table, and the large screen TVs in the background playing a true crime cold case file complete with closed captioning. The icing on the cake was when we waited almost 10 minutes for the server to pick up the cash payment portion of our bill (large party and some paid in cash some with cards) and she never came. We finally just got up and left- leaving the money on the table- and the hostess stopped my mother at the door and said \"excuse me miss, did you pay the rest of your bill?\". Not a nice way to treat your customers- especially when they have a check close to 400 dollars. I'd like to reiterate that the food wasn't bad but won't be coming back. It was an awkward and unwelcoming experience."}
{"text":"The volcano salmon roll and dynamite roll are great. Everything else is amazing too. Always a favorite place at downtown Scottsdale."}
{"text":"The food was great and the beer was cold BUT the main reason I'm coming back is because of Bailey, she was OUTSTANDING!!!

James"}
{"text":"Best sashimi in the valley hands down! The yellow tail, tuna, salmon, rainbow rolls are all amazing!"}
{"text":"Best sushi I've found in the desert. It's almost a shame to give it 5 stars because it's already too busy.  The sashimi pieces are huge, service has always been great and the saki-bomb setup for $4 is a steal.  I've always sat at the bar so I can't speak about the tapanyaki tables.  Then again, who would want to sit at one of those anyway?  I'll take mine raw."}
{"text":"I have been to Kyoto several times and food is good for the PRICE especially lunches. Phoenix has surprisingly good sushi restaurants and Kyoto is one of them. It's not NY nor LA but...

My biggest beef(or tuna) with Kyoto is their lack of sympathy for people with service animal. They DO NOT allow service animals in their restaurant.  We have two Yorkies and they are our service  dogs.  We have never been denied access to a restaurant before. This is not very AMERICAN. Maybe it's a Japanese thing:(

Anyway NO GO for animal lovers!"}
{"text":"Overpriced for the quality of food. Rice was hard imagine buying pre made rolls at your local grocery store all day.  Uhhh no thanks.  So I took my talents down to Farm & Craft where the drinks and food were far superior."}
{"text":"Can't beat this place for the price and atmosphere.  Saki Bombs for $6 and sushi and tepanyaki prices way cheaper than anyplace around.  Why go to Ra or Benihana when this place is in the heart of old town and way cheaper.  Highly recommend hitting up Kyoto for dinner before going out in Old Town."}
{"text":"You won't find sushi anywhere in Arizona like Koyoto.  I've been eating sushi for 10+ years and have tried pretty much every where in Az and this place is very affordable,  large portions and incredibly delicious, you won't find any place like it."}
{"text":"Lunch for under $4.00?  You bet you.  Super cheap lunch from 11-2pm tues-sunday.  I usually get out of there with a Bento box with Chicken, rice, salad, and slices of oranges for $3.75 and a Tuna Roll for $3.50,  Super cheap!!  I heard dinner is exquisite."}
{"text":"We had such a bad experience after eating here. I'll start by saying the Teppanyaki was fine. Same ole, same ole on the tricks and overly salted food. When we left and went to pick up our car at the 'complimentary' valet however, they were already gone. We went back into the restaurant hoping the keys were with them. They weren't, and the Kyoto was useless. They basically told us we were on our own and didn't even bother to wish us good luck. They were so rude. I'll never go back"}
{"text":"Really cheap and fresh sashimi that is served in a space that resembles the trailer that Budd lived in from the Quentin Tarantino's \"Kill Bill Vol.2\". Good selection of fresh fish coupled with the typical variety of sushi rolls that most people a accustomed to. Nothing too special about Kyoto but it's a great place to pop into and get your sushi fix for a low price."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. Can't get enough of it. I can't go too long without having some squid salad. I dream about it if it's been too long. The sushi and Teppan-Yaki are great. Can't wait to go again."}
{"text":"When we were getting ready for our trip to Arizona I got on Yelp to stake out the best Sushi places in the area. Kyoto seemed to have some of the best reviews, so we decided to check it out. We got there just in time, they close at 2pm for lunch and open back up for dinner later in the day. 
The salmon was fantastic. The unagi was fantastic. the rolls were nothing spectacular, in fact, a little dry. But, all in all, a quality sushi place. The prices were reasonable, about what you'd expect to pay for decent sushi.
What I want to know is this: Is there a good \"all-you-can-eat\" sushi place anywhere in Phoenix or the surrounding burbs?"}
{"text":"Best teppanyaki place. All the food is deli and the cooks are always friendly. Filet mognon and shrimp are in my opinion the best."}
{"text":"The sushi is just barely above average.  The service from the wait staff is good, but the sushi chefs themselves border on rude.  Super inexpensive.  If you need a sushi fix, don't care about the service, and are poor, then this is for you."}
{"text":"Just like the old days. It can never reclaim those days but memory lane was fun."}
{"text":"I like this place. It's a fun atmosphere, the bartender is really friendly and fun. The shots 'banana cum suckers' are soooo good."}
{"text":"Sashimis were not fresh and warm, yes, WARM! $14 tuna toro lacked any flavors. Sea urchins taste like chemicals, and not fresh either. Nigiri rice were warm and hard so it's probably from the day before. Steak tataki were overcooked. A good place to get cheap lunch but not for good sashimi. Service was sub par. Will never come back."}
{"text":"Best sushi in town!  It is my favorite lunch spot because their lunch specials are incredibly cheap and their sushi is always so fresh.  I've been coming here over 10 years and the atmosphere is the same.  We take friends that are from out of town here for sushi and teppanyaki (in the evenings).  Best place ever!"}
{"text":"Teppanyaki, Sushi, Bar & Mussels OUT OF THIS WORLD!

Whether I go to Kyoto for a special occasion and reserve a teppanyaki table, which is always a filling and fun, interactive experience, or grab a saki bomber and some sushi, I always say it's the best restaurant out there. They have a versatile menu, chefs that are approachable - both sushi and teppan have a great attitude and are super fun. Their bar has the BEST prices! One bartender told me that they have not changed their prices since they opened; something like 50 years ago!!! My only complaint is that they aren't open very often - I think their doors normally open around 6pm, and I'm not a senior citizen, but sometimes like to dine earlier :). Parking can be somewhat of a challenge, but it's to be expected in Scottsdale. I LOVE this place!!! Always have and always will!"}
{"text":"Well, maybe my husband and I have been spoiled by all the great Japanese food available in Los Angeles. This place just does not have good Japanese food. Even something simple like chicken teriyaki and miso soup were not great. Chunky teriyaki chicken, plus big pieces of mushroom in chicken teriyaki and miso soup?! And the sushi and the sashimi were just not that great. What's up with big pieces of sea scallops for baked dynamite scallops?  So glad to be back in LA for yummy Japanese food again!"}
{"text":"One of the first sushi spots in that area and it should be the first on your list when you're craving some Japaness goodness.

We had the soft crab roll, volcano, icsh roll, and some white tail and octopus sashimi... BUT...WE WANTED MORE! Ugh unfortunately, my stupid tummy didn't have room for more, but there's always next time!"}
{"text":"Was having a great experience until my girlfriend pointed out a roach on the sushi bar! I understand it can happen, but it really did ruin my appetite. :("}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots to go to for good, cheap, and (usually) fast sushi. I usually always sit at the sushi bar, because this place can get busy at there regular tables. Usually when I'm in the mood for sushi, I go to this place. I love everything about it, the only couple times I havent enjoyed my sushi were when we had gotten a couple special rolls, which I can't even remember the name of those since they were so forgettable. Service is great, and our drinks are replenished rather quickly. My fiance and I can become stuffed with sushi for about $20 for the both of us."}
{"text":"I've been going to Kyoto for nearly 10 years now, by far has always been my favorite Scottsdale sushi place. The bento box lunch specials are incredible. Regretably, I have to change my opinion. 

The service has gone downhill drastically. My BF and I loved to go for the #8 sashimi box, I don't like salmon so I always sub more tuna. 9x out of 10, order comes out wrong. Haven't been there 1 time when we didn't have to sit with empty water glasses for 15 min. So we stopped going for a while. 

Yesterday, we decided to give Kyoto a 2nd chance. Service was perfectly fine this time (noticed a few new faces) but to my lament... Our sashimi was warm and mushy. NOT what you want to see! I couldn't even eat it, so gave to my BF. Well, guess who spent the next 24 hrs sitting on the porcelain throne. 

Yes, it's AZ and it's hot. But if it's not fit to eat... DON'T SERVE IT! 

I'm truly sad, but I don't think I'll be going back unless I'm in the mood for something cooked."}
{"text":"Went here for my bday last night and the food was just as good as it was before they closed for a while. The updates look nice and clean. Everyone from the hostess to the chef was super friendly. Sad to see the lunch prices went up but I doubt that'll stop me from going."}
{"text":"My wife and I love this place.  It's our favorite sushi.  Yes, it is always packed (you are a tool if you haven't figured out to get there before 7:30p for dinner), and most of it is typical N. Scottsdale kids who are at the bar and acting like idiots.  The sushi is priced cheap for Scottsdale and always tastes great, never a problem with \"catching\" anything, like another reviewer said, and we've been here 6 - 7 times at least.  Lunch is a really good deal too.  Never tried the grill but always looks great."}
{"text":"This is the best kept lunch secret in town!!! meets all my criteria.  good food, big portions and cheap.  Had California rolls, Teriyaki chicken with a salad.  It was all great!"}
{"text":"Been going here for over 20 years.  Sushi is world class.  Not a glam sushi bar with ok overpriced sushi.  Saki bombers $6.00, was $5 20 years ago.  They don't raise their prices very often.  Lunches are a great deal too.  Teppan tables are fun for special occasions.  Great old school sushi bar!!!"}
{"text":"Best table prep I have seen since that place in the Biltmore....love their sushi as well.  This is a downtown Scottsdale attraction and rightly so!  A must see and eat place.

We have gone there every year for my wife's birthday since we have been married, and that's now 9 years.  Always great service, and good food."}
{"text":"I have been a satisfied customer of Kyoto for over 15 years.  It is the first place I have tried sushi & I have taken many sushi virgins there to pop their cherry.  Sushi is fabulous & a great price.  The Dynamite is absolutely to die for.  

This is a place I've celebrated milestone bithdays, dates, many a great Saturday night.  It is a place I always want to come back to."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch since we work close with a group of four. Took 20 minutes for our waters to arrive then 30 minutes for the food. The only good thing about this place is at least they brought the check out quickly. No complaints on food but with as much competition as there is in the area I hope this place figures it out before their employees are out of work."}
{"text":"If you're looking for the best sushi and teppanyaki in Scottsdale look no further! Quick service, delicious food, and just all around good experience. I've hit up all the sushi places in Scottsdale and Kyoto has the most authentic and creative sushi. Even my friend that frequents Japan is greatly impressed with everything this place has to offer."}
{"text":"Don't expect perfection or anything too fancy at Kyoto. It's a hidden right in the heart of Old Town Scottsdale. Their sushi is decent and well priced for what you get. This is our very casual go to with friends when we don't want to drive up to Sakana. Hot saki (bombers) come free with beer - potentially a great spot to get a nice buzz before a night out in Old Town."}
{"text":"The best sushi restaurant in Arizona! I have been going many Japanese restaurant. This is the one of selling fresh food with good price!!! I'm so so so happy this place came back to business after closed down for over 1 year."}
{"text":"I stopped in with a friend on a Saturday night after a friend had recommended it to me and was totally thrilled we did. We sat at a table for sushi and waited no longer than 10 minutes for a table - amazing for 8 pm on a Saturday in old towne.

Unfortunately, they had sold out of the oysters, but the other dishes we'd ordered were fabulous - starting with a seared tuna dish, then softshell crab roll, rainbow roll, and the green mussels. The seared tuna was cooked and cut perfectly - just the right temperature with a peppery \"rub,\" the rolls were a decent size with thick cuts of fish and plenty of flavorful crab, and the mussels were a tad overcooked for my preference but the creamy texture and buttery flavor still made it a winner. 

The thing I appreciated most was actually the service - we weren't rushed or hassled, and the food came out a dish at a time, giving us a chance to eat and enjoy before getting our next dish. At other sushi joints, I am constantly feeling rushed while trying to fit all of the dishes on the table (and I'm not what you'd call a slow eater!). This was a happy medium for me. The server confirmed that we were ready for the bill instead of just dropping it off without asking - it's the little details that make a big difference to me.

My only other con was creepy old men leering at us from the bar...but that's what you get in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Stopped here for dinner last week, when my son and I were in town to see some spring training games.  We were seated promptly and the service was really good.  The staff is friendly and helpful.

We got the Okinawan sweet potato fries free with my Yelp check-in offer.  The fries were just OK and the Miso dressing wasn't as flavorful as we would have liked.  

However, the Eel and Cucumber roll was good.  My son ordered the Beef Teriyaki and I ordered the Chicken Teriyaki dinners.  The dishes came with a large portion of steamed rice and there were a mound of mushrooms, onions, bell peppers and egg plant under the meat.  At first glance, we thought there wasn't enough food.  However, once we dug-in and finished our dinner, we left with full stomachs and were very content. 
We enjoyed the Teriyaki sauce they use, since it was a bit thicker than most places and quite tasty."}
{"text":"This place was sold for the 2nd time, and is much more expensive and not good. There are too many other good sushi places with far better food."}
{"text":"I have been going to Kyoto for more than 20 years. It's still my favorite sushi in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Cons:
-Service SUCKS (for lack of a better word) so bad during lunch hours. There's a waitress who always works there during lunch hours who's so spacey that she will never see you if you need her attention. Refilling drinks is not apart of her job description either, I'm guessing. Kyoto (whether it be the servers or the people preparing the food) gets our order wrong about 80% of the time.
-Food is a hit or miss thing. Some of their stuff is heavenly good, and some of it tastes like sewage. Trying asking for a recommendation from someone.
-You need reservations if you go there on a weekend night, guaranteed.

Pros:
-Go during lunch hours! The prices are insanely great! You can get a whole bento box with sashimi for around or less then $5! Considering the usual price of sashimi combos, this is the best deal I've seen ever.
-The sashimi (which encompasses most of what I've had there anyway) is also extremely fresh and the servings are relatively generous.

Overall: Service is below average, but the sushi is high quality for a great price."}
{"text":"Kyoto is by far my favorite place to eat sushi in Scottsdale. The atmosphere feels authentic, the prices are great, and the staff is top notch. One of the best places to throw a birthday party, have a fun date, or just hang out with some friends. Reserve a table for some cooked Japanese food and be witness to a show then enjoy a very tasty treat. Hang out in the bar and get served by a friendly bar tender who will give you advice for the rest of your evening. Can't wait for my next time."}
{"text":"I was supposed to come for dinner here tonight for a friends birthday dinner. I have a gluten allergy however so I called ahead to make sure I would be able to eat. The man I spoke to on the phone was extremely rude and even acted offended that I was asking. He said they had gluten free soy sauce, but that they didn't really have any gluten free options which I found confusing. Am I supposed to have gf soy sauce on the side of nothing for dinner? He then said that they aren't an American restaurant so they don't have \"the kind of stuff\" to make things gluten free. I understand that not all restaurants are able to accommodate a gluten free menu or gluten free options, but his passive aggressive tone and rudeness were completely unwarranted. I simply inquired. I have also been to dozens of other Japanese restaurants that have gluten free options and much better customer service so I will be taking my business to one of those. Kyoto lost a party of 5 tonight. I hope his bad attitude was worth it to them."}
{"text":"Ok. Let me qualify this 4 star rating.

It's for lunch. And it's mostly for price.

It's certainly not the best Japanese restaurant I've ever been to. And the food isn't the best. But it's decent. The price is excellent (for lunch).

I used to come here often and grab the Bento box and a California Roll with my buddies for lunch and I'd the door having spent just 10 bucks including tax and tip. I'd be full, and ready to coast through the afternoon on a semi-food coma.

It's worth the visit based on the cost. 

Now you probably want to know why I don't think this is the best restaurant in the world. Well, this is an OLD place. It hasn't been updated since the NIxon administration...at least it seems that way....but what do I know? I was born during last Carter year. 

The Bento Box is $3.75 and you get Teriyaki Chicken w Mushrooms, Rice, a little salad. It's really not bad for the price.  Add a roll for another $3.75 and you got yourself a snazzy cheap little meal.

The restaurant is dark, it kind of smells, but who cares. It's cheap, you'll be in and out of there in no time.

I probably wouldn't go there for dinner. 

Peace."}
{"text":"Ok, it was my first time back here in 9 years. It's so much better than my previous experience. 

The service was great from the moment I got there. A friend & I sat at the sushi bar & had a fabulous cocktail named something with the word spirit in it. Who can remember these things? I've included a photo. 

We were there for a drink and a happy hour snack. We got a couple different kinds of rolls, & both were really good. I'll definitely be back again & much sooner this time."}
{"text":"Amazing presentation and accuracy with taste. Great sushi in Scottsdale. The Chef came out multiple times to make sure we were taken care of."}
{"text":"Food- The sushi is rather poorly rolled for my taste.  Many of the rolls are large in size which is normally good but in this case leads to the sushi falling apart when dipping in soy due to the poor technique in rolling them.  

Price- It is not as cheap as it should be for the quality but it isn't terrible for sushi prices generally.

The food tastes ok but I find that the poor technique is too much for me to get past when eating sushi.  Fish quality is fine but not the best I have had in Phoenix.

Service- This is by far the worst thing about this restaurant.  NEVER SIT AT THE SUSHI BAR because you will have servers constantly reaching over your shoulders all night (during dinner service at least). The servers should have a place to get food for the tables without having to reach over customers.  This is a total failure of this restaurant design.

I get so angry at the bumping and shoving by the servers at the sushi bar that I will never go back.  Each time I go to give them another shot there aren't any tables and they sit me at the bar.  

Go somewhere else to avoid the sub-par, expensive food and terrible service during busy hours."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this place since college, and I can tell you its definitely one of those \"an oldie but a goodie\".  So, its not a fancy schmancy place with hip party music playing and it doesn't serve mixed drinks with cute names like \"hello kitty\", but it should be a staple to anyone's lunch place repertoire.  

They serve bento boxes (basically a lunch box with rice, your choice of entree, salad and slices of oranges--a healthy dessert!) for $3.75.  If you're feeling like a high roller, you can order the sashimi bento box, and that will set you back a whopping $6.

Who says you can't eat good for cheap?"}
{"text":"I have been going to this place for thirty plus years. It is in serious need of an update inside and out. The upside is that the food is great and the prices are even better. We had tempura, a specialty sushi roll, and a chicken bento box for $20. Seriously good deal."}
{"text":"Great time! Food was good, & the service was awesome. I was a bit apprehensive because if all the bad reviews but we went anyways because it's close to home & I'm glad we gave it a chance. Thanks for a wonderful evening."}
{"text":"I have been to Kyoto about 3-4 times in the past 7 years.  I still hasn't changed a bit since the first time I went there when I was fifteen!  I always eat at the grills.  I love places with the tepanaki (I dont know how to spell it) grills.  I have been to many many places like this and Kyoto is just ok.  This place needs some serious redecorating.  It looks like the place is stuck in the 1970's.  The food is good though.  Last time our grill cook was really bad and was droping things all over the place but hey everyone has an off day sometimes.  I may go here again just because its so close to my home but otherwise I've had better."}
{"text":"Food was excellent, the chef at the table was good, however the wait staff as well the bartender were extremely oblivious to their surroundings.  Not once was I offered another drink.  I constantly had to flag someone down in order to keep from being parched."}
{"text":"CLOSED....I just called and got the updated message that due to unforeseen problems with the renovation...they won't reopen til JANUARY possibly FEBUARY...hopefully they get it together and can reopen soon...l like Kyoto"}
{"text":"I love this place! I been dining here for 12 years. Very low price for lunch and fish is flown fresh daily!"}
{"text":"Overpriced and very odd atmosphere.  Its old and low ceilings.  Location was great and the food was good--just way too high for what you get."}
{"text":"Sushi was FANTASTIC. Our server, Hector, was an awesome guy, very helpful, very willing to accommodate. We got all sorts of rolls, and each one was better than the last. The Alaska roll came with lemon slices on it, which was my favorite touch. What a place!"}
{"text":"When I'm cruising PHX and can't make it to Sakana then I come here.  

Friday and Saturday nite is like a frat party.  By now, any night in Scottsdale must be like a frat party.  Go midweek, sit at the bar and enjoy the quality of this place.  See you next month."}
{"text":"So the food was phenomenal. We started with the hot sake and moved to the Japanese whiskey old fashioned  from there we got the pork gyoza, slice of heaven roll and spicy señorita roll. Service was spot on and when it took a while to bring a drink they comped it. Since we couldn't get enough we finished with the fiery dragon roll. We're savory over sweet so no need for desert. We will definitely be back, oh and Paula was such a doll. Super professional and on top of things. Highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"I have been a patron of Kyoto for 15 years, in fact went on a really bad date there when I was 21.  Even though the date was painfully bad it didn't ruin my taste for Kyoto.  Now I love sushi and have been to many places in town so I have much to compare it to.  But the reason I come here more than any other place is I can enjoy a great sashimi lunch for less than $10 dollars or come have dinner plus drinks for around $25.  That makes me and my wallet very happy.  I walk to it from work and have lunch usually once a week. Have taken 3 of my stylist who have never been there before and turned them in to Kyoto fans.  The service is great, really friendly and I like that they recognize me always asking \"how's business?  Good to see you again!\"  It is another place here in old town that make me feel like I am not lost in the tourist shuffle."}
{"text":"well..... yea ...

this is scottsdale original sushi bar that has been awarded for the best sushi for more than 16 yrs? reallly? wait a second.. we ARE in arizona, so hmm, mebe the standards are quite different ... 

i, for one, was not thrilled ...  must say the sushi was quite ginormous but it sure didn't taste all that yummy and fresh... an average sushi ranged from $4 and up but honestly, if i was living in scottsdale, i would TOTALLY come for lunch... where can you find a deal for less than $5? whether you get chicken teriyaki/cutlet or whatever it was literally $3.50. YES! for lunch!!!

$3.50 for lunch! so unheard of! +1 for that

dinner?

an average dinner is $20/up... SO not worth it... 

and who puts big chunky mushrooms in miso soup and sadly, there wasn't a SINGLE TOFU! is it just me or is that simply weird?"}
{"text":"Good quality for the price. The food tastes very well like other people reviewed. It wasn't like real Japanese style, but it is still okay to have a decent meal in the casual atmosphere."}
{"text":"I'm glad I can finally write a review for this place. I've been a customer since 2013 and I was so happy to hear they opened again! The lunch specials are amazing. Generous portions, great variety, tastes delicious and the prices are the best in all of old town.

If you work, live, or happen to be in the area, do yourself a favor and come here for lunch! If you're having dinner plans, they have Teppanyaki tables as well so you can enjoy the show and great food.

Sushi selection is also quite awesome and the staff is always friendly. I only have amazing things to say about this place over the years. Thanks to Kyoto for being around!"}
{"text":"Sushi was good atmosphere was great. The service was awful. We ordered drinks from our waitress that seemed as if she was on drugs or just so ditsy because she didn't know the menu or anything about the restaurant or how to talk to customers. Anyway, we waited 15 min before finally asking why our drinks hadn't came. Our waitress was no where to be found the rest of our time at the restaurant. Also, she never brought out our meal we had to grab it ourselves from the sushi bar because nobody cared to wait on us."}
{"text":"Not impressed. The service was slow and they never asked for drink-refills. The waitress seemed to be MIA most of the night. 

I was excited to hear that they serve GLUTEN FREE soy sauce but you have to watch how they prepare it. They poured normal soy sauce all over my meal and I had to have them recook mine. We had a large group of ppl (15) and we agreed we won't be returning. 

On a positive note.....the sushi was awesome!"}
{"text":"Don't expect much from this place. Place is dingy, especially for it being in Scottsdale. The service was okay, but the sushi rolls were sub par. There was even one roll, the group couldn't even finish because the fish tasted old. 

We won't be back."}
{"text":"Every time I've been here the food has been excellent! Whenever family comes into town and we can't think of a place to go Kyoto always comes up because it never disappoints! The entrées are a decent portion, we always split them cause unless you're starving you won't be able to finish it on your own. I do have to say though that every time we've gone we've only ever done the teppanyaki so I don't know what their bento is like but I can't imagine it being bad. Def go with a cool group and enjoy the show!"}
{"text":"My husband and I LOVE sushi date nights because it is something that I don't make at home. That said, Kyoto is one of our go-to spots because you can sit at the sushi bar and watch their chefs work their magic + they have an INCREDIBLE happy hour! 

ALSO - check in on Yelp for a complimentary Sunomono Salad (cucumber salad). It is a big portion too! 

My absolute musts when I come are spicy edamame, miso soup, house salad (I love their ginger dressing), fried rice, and then...the SUSHI! We actually switch up the rolls every time because we like to try new things but last night, we ordered the CRAZY roll and you guys - it was a dream come true! I'm currently obsessed with shishito peppers and this roll was topped with them + they DO NOT skimp on the avocado. Yes, please! We also love the basics like spicy tuna, spicy crab, etc. Also, their fried rice is the best fried rice that i've EVER had. It is SO flavorful and you can order a small side if you don't want the big order. But the big order has chicken, steak, AND shrimp in it. Pretty hard to resist. 

Anywho, we'll definitely be back soon! Thank you for always curing our sushi cravings! :)"}
{"text":"A true Scottsdale tradition, Kyoto offers fabulous sushi in a dive-y yet oh-so-hip atmosphere. Their Tako Salad is one of the best and the teppanyaki tables (for those who want cooked food) really are a blast.

Kyoto's hidden secret is its great lunch specials. You can get your sushi fix for under $10 and avoid the crowds that come in the evening.  Bento boxes with terriaki chicken will please your non-sushi friends. I'm so glad this place survived downtown Scottsdale's growth spurt!"}
{"text":"Good food, highly questionable service! Without a good location, and a long history, they would struggle... Someone needs some customer service training. Like their entire staff!"}
{"text":"I regretably went here for my birthday last night.

Ordered the Ichi roll and got a death mayo alien roll.

This was the worst thing I have ever tasted. 

1) it had at least a handful of mayo blahh

2) it had a pound of crab that looked like red/white spaghetti ( soo gross)

3) had the texture of a raw pumpkin sliced in thin strings

4) tasted like licking an old fish

We got the waitress to refund the sushi since it was un-edible. 
when she brought the bill it was not itemized and we could not figure out how it came to that much.
The entire time our waitress was never there, never refilled our drinks.
We finally flagged her down to get a break down of the bill.
she came back with the same copy!!!
We asked a different person who grabbed her to help us.
She came to the table and asked \"do you have a problem with me?\" WTF!!!

We told her  ignoring what she said \" can you just bring us a breakdown of the bill\"

She came back AGAIN, with an un itemized copy!!

I would not have tipped her but on parties of 6+ the add 17% gratuity

Which btw she added 20% without permission.

We were there for so long ad wanted to leave otherwise I would have disputed that tip charge in full.

You dont come up to customers and ask if they have a problem with you!!!

Not only was the food the grossest shit ever, the service can suck my ass!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I visited this past weekend for the second time. The first time was about 4 years ago and the food and service was excellent. Unfortunately this time was unsatisfactory. First, I called to make a reservation and was told to come at a later time because the restaurant was busy. When we arrived 20 mins earlier, the restaurant was dead. We sat at an 8 person grill with one other couple. The chef came quickly and our food was all prepared in 15 mins. My main complaint concerns the portions of food. I ordered the shrimp dinner and was given 8 tiny shrimp. I was hungry when we left. At other teppanyaki restaurants, the portions are healthy and satisfying. My husband ordered steak and shrimp. The steak was overcooked and he also received 8 shrimp. His portions were acceptable. His meal was $5 more than mine and received twice the amount of food. Moral to this story - order a combo or you'll be hungry and I mean very hungry!!!"}
{"text":"Sushi that won't strain your budget.  Kyoto Japanese has been my go to place for Sushi for 25+ years now.  Lunch is the best value in town.  If you are looking for a swank, place to be seen Sushi joint, then head down the street to one of the other plentiful Japanese / Sushi restaurants.  If you are looking for a place with good sushi at a reasonable price and a friendly staff to serve you, then visit Kyoto.  I did notice that they recently raised prices after 25 years but I think you can still afford it. The price for a Tuna Roll is now a whooping $4.  Come on....you can't beat that and it is always fresh.   The Teppanyaki tables are fun and entertaining.

Oh, almost forgot......A Sake Bomber / Sake with a 22oz Beer is just $6 (at least last time I checked)

 If you have not been to Kyoto, be sure to make this one of your upcoming destinations."}
{"text":"Love love love! This is the go-to place when my boyfriend and I want sushi. And we are sushi lovers.

The prices are ridiculously low for the quality and location. Regardless of pricing, the sushi is still the best in the Valley (in my opinion). This is also coming from a Japanese girl :)

In our most recent visit, my boyfriend and I sat at the sushi bar and asked the chef for a recommendation. We ordered the Hawaiian Ono sashimi because of it, and it was tasty! We love our standard selection, but it's nice to order new things every now and then.

When you go for lunch, the specials are even cheaper in price and just as delicious. I have no complaints about this place."}
{"text":"Update!

Went back last night for dinner, this place is still awesome. I had the Las Vegas Rolls, they were pure deep fried goodness."}
{"text":"Though I'm familiar with Scottsdale and live close to Old Town I had somehow never noticed Kyoto despite it's proximity to the Breakfast club and Bungalow.

I had gone with a friend who wanted sushi, thinking (and not really minding) that he was talking about the Kyoto Bowl on Scottsdale Rd near the Walgreens. No no no. This is a much better culinary experience by far.

Besides the surprise birthday details we were seated at one of the teppanyaki tables and this not being my first time it was a great experience. There wasn't any showboating by the cook this time but that was fine with me. Had an array of sushi that was all fresh tasting and well proportioned and some excellent sake too. 

It might be slightly priced on the high end of things (but I didn't pay for it so I can't say precisely more about it) but a great place to go eat with friends or a loved one."}
{"text":"As mentioned earlier, the best thing about this place is the super cheap, but super delicious lunch bentos.  You get a main dish, rice, salad, and an orange for under $4. If that's not enough, you can get double meat for a buck or two more.  I highly recommend the ginger pork or the katsu.  My friend I normally go with is a big fan of the white fish (fried or grilled).  The sushi here isn't bad.  It's nothing super special, but I don't come here for the sushi so it's not a big knock against the place.

As they would say on ebay: A+++ Great Seller! Would eat here again!!!"}
{"text":"Alright, lets set a few things straight. My experience equates to a three, yes, however I was almost tempted to give it a 4, simply to offset some of the ridiculously unjustified one or two star reviews I've read below. 

*To complain about the tuna in a spicy tuna roll being mashed, because it ruins the texture and the flavor of the tuna? Sincerely, if its texture and integrity of tuna flavor that your looking for perhaps you shouldn't be eating a roll where traditionally, you \"mash\" the tuna, adding a slew of \"spicy\" seasonings into it? Try the sashimi perhaps? Just a thought.

*To give a restaurant a 2star rating because they didn't provide noodles like Benihana? Also might be an unfair comparison. 

*Another 2 star rating because they didnt like the hostess stand being by the door? I'm not even sure I understand this complaint.

Anyhow, here goes my own personal experience.

Promptly greeted and as the restaurant was full, even on an off night, were seated at the sushi bar, which is fine, because its where we wanted to go anyhow. Ordered a cocktail from their slightly pedestrian bar offerings. A little surprised that the edamame wasn't complimentary, but didn't mind too much since, one - i think this might be a Scottsdale thing - and two, both it and the soup, as many people have stated, were very inexpensive. Ordered sushi, and a few tidbits from the kitchen, Server was nice, friendly and as attentive as could have been expected as busy as she was. Sushi was slightly undersized in portions (and yes, even for classic Japanese standards) but when the bill came, it reflected the size fittingly, leaving no thoughts as to it being over-priced. Sushi Chef (not the owner.) was skilled but seemed either lacking in rapport with the guests, or just too busy to show some sense of personality.*shrug, but i suppose as long as he gets the job done, thats all that matters. Experience was altogether pleasing, but did seem as if there was always a ying to the yang to consistently make the 4 star experience back to a 3. 

PROS: *Pleasant server
              *Good sushi, quality fish, nice cuts.
              *Undersized portions but also very reasonable price tags

CONS:   *Fairly pedestrian bar and sake selections. 
                 Bar i can forgive, but wish the sake selection was a little
                  more interesting.
                 *No little freebies that you see in some other Japanese
                  restaurants. Edamame, Soup, even the rice, yep..paid for.
                * No desserts available whatsoever. Nada, Zip Zilch.

You know what? I AM going to give it a 4, because if the pricing, quality and service for lunch is anything like dinner, I'm still a fan and ill definitely be trying this place again. (Also, like i said to help offset some of what I think are those unfair one and two star reviews.) True, nothing blew me away about the experience...but definitely nothing so overwhelming  bad to deserve a 1 or 2 star review. Next time I'm craving sushi, Kyoto will work just fine. Hope this helps!"}
{"text":"The staff took 10 minutes to get my friend and I menus and water. The sushi staff completely forgot about our order 30 min after getting salads and the appetizer. This place seems to be running in disarray."}
{"text":"I was told this place used to be the \"hot spot\"  back in the day.  My review is strictly based on the bar and teppan experience(I have not tried their sushi yet).  

We had 9 in our group on a Thursday night and we started off with a round of beers at the bar.  It's a nice touch that every beer we ordered came with a small bottle of sake!  The bar is small and we pretty much took up the whole area, which also happens to be right where the front door of the place is.

There are a few teppan tables in the very back of the place, and our group of 9 just barely fit comfortably.  The \"show\" before the cooking started was one of the better ones I've seen(it was the first time I've seen them light a trail of fire around the table and into each of our dinner plates!).  I ordered steak and lobster with fried rice, and it turned out pretty delicious.  One disappointment I had during the cooking process was that the fried rice was not prepared for us on the grill...it came out in bowls straight from the kitchen.  

The miso was ok, nothing to write home to mom about.

They do NOT have \"golden shrimp\"(I'm beginning to think no teppan place in Arizona has this).

Bathrooms are small and kind of grungy(1 urinal, 1 stall, 1 sink)."}
{"text":"We went here on Valentine's Day for a friend's birthday.  I do love that it is a local version of Benihana's.  But they are lacking in their flavor.  I wish they would have made the fried rice in front of us instead of bringing it out with our food already made.  Sure, this would make it like all those other places...except this meant we only got to watch the chef make our grilled veggies and meat.  It made for a slightly less exciting experience.  We did enjoy our food though and it is worth at least one trip in, especially if you are a supporter of local restaurants.  Don't come in thinking it is like the bigger more mainstream versions though."}
{"text":"My family and I went there for father's day and had as great time. Food is always excellent but a bit slow due to cooked to order which I prefer. This is the few places you can get sushi fully cooked, prepared.  I love the deep fried Vegas roll. As for price, it is higher than most. You really do get higher quality meats and well worth the price differences. Our waitress was attentive and explained the menu, options well. Will definitely return soon for the happy hour specials and the secret Ramen bowl item."}
{"text":"Memories of a favorite restaurant are all that remains. Sashimi platter is overpriced and underwhelming. The sushi bar operating like a food prep counter at a grocery store.  Other folks are more succinct with the recent disappointment here but it's agreed: skip it."}
{"text":"Had a variety of rolls and saki bombs.  Everything was fresh and tasted great.  Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Came here for a birthday, two of us had the teppanyaki and one had sushi. We all ordered drinks, all of which were disappointing. Two of the three sushi rolls ordered came out about 20 minutes before the teppanyaki chef, so she had already finished eating both of those by the time the chef came out. The last roll came out as we were finishing eating the teppanyaki. The sushi rolls were all good and the only reason for two stars instead of one. The two of us who ordered teppanyaki both got the filet mignon, both of which were the worst filets we've ever had. The meat was very sour and unpleasant. As others have mentioned, the veggies in the fried rice are frozen and the rice is bland. While the sushi was good, we won't be returning. There are other sushi restaurants in Phoenix and Scottsdale that are more affordable and far better."}
{"text":"My mom and I were drawn in by the reasonably priced lunch menu and convenient location- but we quickly discovered that the reasonable menu equated terrible food.  The lunch menu is priced so reasonably ($5-$8 for a complete bento box) that I worried about the quality of the food as we placed our order.  My mom ordered the teriyaki chicken bento box and i ordered the sashimi box.  Neither of us liked the salad dressing (too much ginger), although people who like ginger will probably enjoy it.  I literally had to spit out my first bite of sashimi (tuna).  It was the most fishy and rough piece of fish I've ever tasted.  It was absolutely atrocious and the flavor remained in my mouth long after i spit it out.  After that first bite, I decided against trying the other sashimi out of concern that I would get sick.  My mom's chicken was also terrible- she described it as tough and over cooked.  We politely told the waitress (an older lady, possibly the owner) that we were both unable to eat our meals.  She rudely informed me that the fish was fresh and there was nothing wrong with it.  (note: if that is what they consider fresh fish, then their standards are VERY low).  I apologized and told her that I was unable to eat it.  She grabbed the plate away, but refused to take my mother's food (stating that there was nothing wrong with the chicken).  Another waitress came by and we explained the situation to her.  She was very nice and apologized, and my mom and I left the restaurant.  The food was so atrocious that we literally left without eating!"}
{"text":"This hidden gem in the heart of old town Scottsdale is a must. Great sushi, cheap prices and casual environment. Service can be a hit or miss. The sushi bar is great as they are engaging and you learn about all different kinds of sushi! Stop in...you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"\"A-OK\". That describes fairly accurately my experience here. I imagine if I had gone for the teppanyaki I would have a higher rating, but I was in the mood for sushi.

Unfortunately, the sushi selection here is extremely limited. The fish was nice and fresh, although not the best I've had. And there was a strange spice on the white fish that I found quite surprising. Not necessarily bad, but it seemed out of place. The tako salad was quite tasty, although it was absolutely drowned in ponzu sauce, so beware!

Overall, I wouldn't consider this as a \"destination\" to go back to; however, I wouldn't say no if I were invited to go eat here again."}
{"text":"The flavor of the food was alright but somewhat bland. The guy who made our food at the table was very nice but there was some miscommunication with our order.  We thought they would cook the fried rice in front of us so we paid extra, and then they just brought it to us in a bowl. So nobody ate the rice we paid extra for because it wasn't special...or what we expected. 

Overall, probably would not return with my family."}
{"text":"I was tempted to give this place only 3 stars, but since the food is good and the prices are great I gave it 4. The service is pretty bad though. They either rush you or leave you for a long time. I have to be careful if its on my lunch break. You seriously cant find anything cheaper in Old Town. Its hidden and the parking can be awful, but its worth it. The bento boxes are perfect for lunch and cheap. I wish that they would come with a cali roll like most. If your looking for a very casual place for sushi this is a great spot. Not a date night place or anything. Pretty run down. I guess its been around for a long time so I'm thinking they should do some maintenance."}
{"text":"Our family went to Kyoto to celebrate my brother's birthday and it was so much fun! The servers sang Happy Birthday with special Japanese lyrics and everyone in the restaurant clapped along. We sat at one of their teppanyaki grill tables so we really got a great show with the onion volcano and flaming plates and everything.  The filet mignon, lobster, scallops, shrimp & fried rice were all delicious.  Definitely going back for my birthday this year!!"}
{"text":"Service awesome. Very friendly and social. Sashimi very good.  $ for product over rated.  Lady got veggie roll $8.. nothing special. Happy hour sake bomb.. best deal there, $4.. haven't been able to find better. Roll average.  Haven't tried teppan yet, will go back for 2nd run at it.. the staff is the main reason we will return."}
{"text":"go for the screamin lunch menu!  all the usual fare for $3.50 and up.  plus it's in a nice area and the decor is pleasant.

you can get the same stuff in a styrofoam bowl at those other places but why not eat it out of a bento box and look stylish at the same time?

not earth shattering but then again, it won't cost you and arm and a leg..."}
{"text":"I love this place and I love the manager Dwayne he's so friendly, the staff is always nice, atmosphere's amazing, food is fabulous.. I totally recommend it and there teppanyaki bar's great too."}
{"text":"Awesome spot. Food was excellent and prices were very reasonable. The service was stellar and the vibe was welcoming. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I used to go here before they remodeled/closed for a few years. I wanted to love it, but most things have changed from before. Besides the price increasing which is understandable for Scottsdale, their chicken terriyaki entree is completely different. Before it was covered with thick delicious sauce with yummy chunks of mushroom; now it is an almost flavorless watery sauce with a few tiny mushrooms. Their salad was also my favorite, which now tastes different and is served with bitter spring mix instead of the ice berg, that I think goes better with it... I am hoping for other guests they turn up the flavors a little. At $10 I can get a better tasting chicken from RA or Kabuki."}
{"text":"This place used to be my favorite sushi place when I first started going about 9 years ago. As the years go by, the quality, freshness, and taste of the food has failed to please. I used to recommend this place to friends and visitors, but now I can't even get myself to go in there for a meal."}
{"text":"???????????????Translation: \"Oh, how the mighty have fallen!\"

Many years ago this was a very lovely restaurant, delicately balancing good service, a casual atmosphere, quality food, and good prices, to deliver a delightful dining experience at a good value.

Not so, anymore! The prices have gone up significantly, to the point where this restaurant is priced higher than the finest sushi restaurants in metro Phoenix.  The service had gone down... Lots of loud confusion from the staff, which interrupts the dining experience. 

I ordered salmon sashimi, a seaweed salad, and a side of rice.  The sashimi was delivered first, out of order... Why, I wondered? I'll get to that later. Then came the salad, which was small, but decent. I had to ask my server for the side of rice, which of course, should have been delivered with the sashimi.

Most condemning is the quality of the food. At the tail end of my meal, something on the wall caught my attention... Several chef's knives were magnetically affixed to the walk, which isn't unusual per se.  What was unusual, however, was that none of the sushi chefs (I use the term chef generously) were using knives, and the knives on the wall were extremely dull, so much so that their lack of use and maintenance (sharpening) was visually apparent from several feet away, across the bar.  I wondered... If nobody is using knives, how do they cut the fish? Not to worry, Kyoto patrons!  The sashimi and nigiri is pre-cut!  That way... You can be sure to get your fish as quickly as possible, even before the appetizer salad that you order with your meal!

The fish itself was bland, low quality, poorly cut, and selfishly portioned.

Shame on you, Kyoto, for allowing something good and honest turn into a chaotic mess masquerading as a Japanese restaurant.  I would probably forgive the founders / original owners, because no doubt they cashed out a few years ago, selling to owners who left patrons with this ersatz sushi. 

Full disclosure: the advertised happy hour drink prices appeared to be worthwhile enough to stop in here for a drink.  Just do yourself a favor and skip everything else."}
{"text":"Walking by this place, I always thought it was closed, but apparently its not!
I had a craving sushi so my date took me here. What a shocker! The sushi was really yummy and the service was pretty good. This restaurant has a sushi bar, tables, teppanyaki tables, and a bar. I enjoyed the atmosphere, it was pretty low key compared to other sushi joints in Old Town, which is nice change. I will be coming back!"}
{"text":"The service was terrible, the bartender was working alone and took 30 minutes to get a drink. Also one of the staff had drank all of the Tito's tequila and replaced it with water. Our reservations as for 7:30pm and did not get seated till 9pm. In addition two people from our part got sick from the food. The previous owner from a year ago did a much better job at running the place. I will never come back."}
{"text":"I am so impressed with this place! Came to old town for breakfast but every place had a ridiculous wait. We noticed that Kyoto was open and they had a sign that said they served breakfast. We decided to give it a shot and we are so glad we did. So good and great prices!"}
{"text":"Kyoto does a good job of doing what it does.  That being said, if you've been to one Kyoto, you've been to them all.  

Tepanaki (you know what I'm trying to spell here dont you?) tables, the Japanese dude lighting onion towers on fire on the table in front of you...taking pictures to put on your birthday mug...yes, its all the same.  But its all good.  Delicious actually.  Never a bad meal have I eaten at Kyoto.  

Never have I not waited in a line as long as the nile either.  \"But I have reservations!\"  They dont care.  Tell Lisa-Lipgloss to hurry her sweet cheeks up because they wont seat any of you until shes there.  Pony up to the bar for some savory (and surprisingly super cheap) saki bombs while you wait, and you'll forget you actually came to eat.  If you still have an urge to eat, do it right and get both sushi and a tepan-cooked meal...you'll be impressed and its not overpriced, you get a ton of food.

Bring your appetite, patience and your valet money and roll through Kyoto...the annoyances are worth your weight in sushi."}
{"text":"Thank God Kyoto is back.   Been coming here for thirty years.   This is as authentic as it gets.   Had the Masago Nigiri with eggs -- one word exquisite.  Had the Beef Sashimi extra spicy -- so awesome.   The fried rice is the best.  Just the best most authentic Sushi in Az.  Masa started this place long ago, he would be proud that the food is still the best sushi in Az     Try the Saki bombers, they have 12 flavors.  Perfect local joint*****"}
{"text":"I have been here twice and both times I ordered a rare steak and both times I received a medium steak. The rest of the food is delicious though. The atmosphere and service is good. It's expensive though and I feel like there are better restraurants to drop 100 dollars at for two."}
{"text":"I have been a patron for YEARS!  There is no better sushi in Scottsdale. Their fish is as fresh as it gets, they are wonderful people and when we walk in the door, they know where to look at the sushi bar to see if our spots are available...unless Lisa is working at the bar, then we eat there!"}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place around dinner time and decided to give it a try. Bad decision.

I will first give you the worst. My fiance had explosive diarrhea all night after eating here. He ordered Ichi Roll.

I wish I had read the review on this restaurant then I would have avoided this place. The other reviewer has described this Ichi Roll. I completely agree. Gross. In addition to what he described, this roll is huge, the size of a burger patti! No roll should be so big that you can't fit in your mouth. That just goes to show the chef does not know Japanese cuisine.

I ordered dragon roll, which is eel and avocado. Overall flavor is okay but the texture of the fish is mushier than usual that it makes me think perhaps it's not fresh.

The green tea. Watered down. Not much flavor.

Edamame. Tasted like store bought Edamame, but it's the kind that's overstocked and about to expire. You get the Idea.

So, will I come back to this restaurant? You tell me."}
{"text":"Best sushi in old town Scottsdale. Great food and prices are reasonable. Service is super friendly. Atmosphere is great and they have two different bars. Went in for dinner and we had six rolls between two people which was plenty of food. Fish is fresh and delicious. Great for families or a meal with a group."}
{"text":"Dude this place totally sucks a bums nacho cheese nut sack!!! i went there one time Cause everyone was like this place is sooo good, they jack off on your food its great. that sounded good, but when i went there no jacking off on the food, wtf!! but seriously the sushi roll we ordered was the size of a chipotle burrito and tasted like an old obese man farted threw an onion in to a tuna fish can!! not only did the food have quality that only McDonald's can do but the service was terrible. our waitress pulled out a shotgun and stuck it in my mouth and told me to say hello to the devil for her! i couldn't believe it considering we were eye fucking each other across the room to the ghost theme song. she made me tip her, and not the tip i wanted to give her.... mm mm. oh sorry anyway, if u want white trash gas station quality sushi and service that would make you feel like your in the movie Saw than eat at Kyoto \" Home of the Garbage Roll\".... one other thing they serve there food on a garbage lid"}
{"text":"First of all let me start by saying this was one of the best experiences I've had in old town Scottsdale. Our server Bailey did an outstanding job describing each sashimi to our table. 

I ordered the ponyo refresher and I gotta say it was one of the better cocktails Scottsdale has to offer!  Service was amazing bussers came by assuring we had drinks filled and tables clean and our server was very attentive of our needs. Definitely 5 out of 5!!!!

If you come in ask for BAILEY

Thank you Bailey and the Kyoto family for the hospitality we received today !"}
{"text":"The chef was great; very entertaining! The creepy manager looming around the hibachi tables was weird, to say the least. When I saw frozen  veggies on the grill as an ingredient for fried rice I was done. Even Panda Express uses fresh veggies! I've heard this is a great place for drinks, not food. Unfortunately, that was after we ate here."}
{"text":"Kyoto continues to be a rockin' good time! Every time I visit, Kyoto provides an activity dinner experience! Between the saki bombs, the entertaining chef and the good food, Kyoto has the tri-fecta. Be warned that on the weekends, you will experience a wait, so it's best to call ahead and make a reservation."}
{"text":"Food was very good. Hibachi chef wasn't as enthusiastic as I'm used to and wasn't considerate of my parties years, but the food was good. Sushi wasn't the bad, but what can you expect from a restaurant in the middle of the desert? Sushi chef's play loud pip music, which I didn't mind but if you're not a fan, you won't like it. I usually like more of a Japanese type feel. Not sure if I'd go again"}
{"text":"I went to Kyoto with some girlfriends from work and we had a blast. Let me just say their bento lunch specials cannot be beat. 

To start, we all ordered the miso soup- IT WAS EXTRAODINARY! I would live off that soup if I could. It had so many mushrooms in it which I love. For my meal,  I got the chicken in teriyaki sauce- which came with salad, rice, and orange slices. I ate it all. The best part all of my meal was only $6. 

I had friends get the sashimi and the tempura bento boxes. I think I might try the tempura box the next time we go. The server and host were very nice."}
{"text":"There is a reason why when I lived in Scottsdale for 3 1/2 years I never ate at Kyoto. But upon my last visit I decided I should try a new place.
Hmmmm.... I now have also learned to ALWAYS trust my trusty yelper's reviews. 
This was a bad choice on my part. Bad, slow service. Poor sushi selection. No wine menu. 
The sushi came out cut as thick as a piece of steak. I hate thickly cut sushi. Rolls.....bland. Ambiance was that of a cheap, generic restaurant. 
The good.....cheap, sushi was fresh and didn't taste bad.
But with all that being said I'll pass on a next time here."}
{"text":"Great find! The boyfriend and I were aiming to check out Geisha A Go Go's happy hour but no seats and loud music drew us to find a more intimate spot. Kyoto hit the spot! The sushi was great at a reasonable price off the regular menu. The staff was friendly and laid back yet still attentive which was refreshing.  I loved all the rolls we tried: (in order of favorites) caterpillar, Philadelphia, Salmon volcano (warning it is salt that they light on fire), tuna maki, and another I can't remember. Although the boyfriend is still partial to Roka Akor, I think this is my new favorite location! I definitely cannot wait to come back and please open a location in Glendale!"}
{"text":"Lukewarm hibachi experience.    The fried rice is pre-made,  not prepared on the grill.   Also,  our chef chopped up the shrimp (I suspect to give the illusion you're getting more).    I ordered shrimp/chicken hibachi and  all of my shrimp was chopped up like \"kibbles and bits\" dog food.   (Do you really have to chop up medium sized shrimp, geeez aren't  they already shrimp??).   Also. The veggies were significantly over cooked.   The chicken was good.   On the other hand, Kyoto has superior customer service; when I discovered my fork was dirty (hard white material) they promptly brought me another one."}
{"text":"* Kyoto * - This used to be our \"go-to\" sushi place when we were in College.  Literally a sushi roll stuffed with quality fish was $2.99.

Fast forward 20 years and; as expected, the prices have grown with inflation significantly.  The quality is still decent, but lacks imagination.  I am not sure if that is good or bad.  Many sushi restaurants are getting a little to creative for my liking.  I prefer standards like \"Maki, Sashimi or Hand Rolls\".

Kyoto is a good time and should be experienced at least once.  The bar gets quite crowded and they also do Teppanyaki which is very popular.  So, if you want to avoid the crowds, hit them up for lunch; or, dinner Sunday - Wednesday.

They are located right in the heart of Old-Town; so, go eat some decent sushi then stroll around town and see what kind of trouble you can stay out of!"}
{"text":"Food was good, service was terrible. Initial service was good but then the server disappeared for a good 30 minutes. I had to get up and ask her to come to our table to take additional drink orders (and I also let her know we hadn't gotten our salads yet and we were already eating our entrees).  This place needs serious attention when it comes to service. These things are such easy fixes, get 1-2 more people helping. While I was waiting for my fiancé to get out of the bathroom, I heard to coworkers ranting about how someone complained about the service."}
{"text":"I knew about this place when I asked a co-worker who lives in the area.  The first time I tried it was great. I talked to to authentic japanese sushi chef and he made Omakase (chef special ) for me. I think he was very good because the second time my coworker and I went again it was another guy cuttnig up the fish. He wasn't very good so I didn't enjoy it. 
SO it depends on the chef......"}
{"text":"I have been going here for a VERY long time. They recently went through an ownership change and renovation. IT IS AWESOME. The food is great; fresh, and Oishee des.

If you stopped going while it was closed, give it another try...You wont be disappointed"}
{"text":"I had never been to a tappenaki restaurant before, but I was invited to a birthday party here tonight and it was my first experience! I really enjoyed it, it was a fun time. I thought about ordering the tofu but for $18 I didn't think it would be worth it since I wouldn't have anyone to share my meal with and I was not super hungry.
The service there was great, they were super accommodating to me being a vegetarian. They cooked the vegetables away from the meat for me which was really nice! The vegetables were delicious too, a lot of my fave veggies in that mix!
As my meal I ended up just getting a veggie roll. It was very tasty, I haven't had too much veggie sushi before, but I liked this quite a bit! I was surprised at how full I was when I left because it didn't seem like that much food, but I was filled up for sure. I would come back, it's really awesome how long it has been there too!"}
{"text":"One of my old-school stand out favorites.  Have been coming here for at least 10 years if not more.  The owner is always there and friendly.  (Always thanks you for coming in no less).  For lunch they have amazing bento box lunches for under 6.00 dollars.  If you crave teppan, they have old school teppan dinners where you can see your food aflame and cooked for you.  If it were closer to downtown Phoenix I would be parked here.  I like to see that it refuses to change as the rest of Scottsdale becomes trendier....I love that it hasn't changed and that the quality of food and service is still great.  
For dinner its going to be old-school, i.e. not trendy and nothing challenging.  This place did have its heydey about ten years ago, but that said, its comforting and good."}
{"text":"I must confess i have only been here for Lunch, but it is one of the best deals in town for Lunch.  My friend and i just ate there and had Chicken teriyaki, white rice, salad, 2 sushi rolls and a squid salad and only paid $13 each...I mean c'mon-that's pretty hard to beat.  Just the Chicken w rice and salad is $3.50 and it's so filing and delicious! Would recommend it to anyone who likes a filling tasty meal for a cheap price."}
{"text":"I've been to Kyoto about 100 times for lunch, and I've never been disappointed.  Great prices, and a very friendly staff."}
{"text":"For the price this place is awesome.  The service you may find a bit slow, but if your not a scottsdale brat, and dont expect someone else to wipe your ass for you, you will love this place.  The lunch prices are unreal, and I've taken my kids here for there birthday at the teppanyaki tables - which we all loved.  The sushi is better than Ra for the price in my opinion.  So let me say again if you're not a snobby scottsdale brat you will indeed love this place."}
{"text":"Great food, great service , and at an awesome location . Price have increased dramatically here in the last 6-9 months ... thus the 4 stars."}
{"text":"I went last night as a party of three. First visit for two of us. Three takeaways: food was just okay, filet mignon was not worth it and service was poor. Emphasis on the latter.

Food was what you may expect at a place like this - salty. So you're just bloated after the meal from all the sodium. Not their fault, but just the style of teppanyaki. The filet mignon didn't particularly do it for me, but it is a better piece of meat than the NY Strip so you can make you're own call there.

Service was just really poor. Our reservation was late getting started by about 20 minutes, but I wasn't really all that upset - some patrons take longer than others, I get it. But once we sat down, it took more than ten minutes for a server to come take our drink order. Enough time for the manager to come apologize and introduce her to us. We just got sodas that were never refilled throughout the meal until one of us asked for a refill. I don't think they would have ever noticed and it wasn't as if just one person was coming around. There was the server, two different food runners with water and the manager.

And then the final bit of disappointment was the rice coming out. I was halfway done with my meal before the rice ever made it. The other party at our table received theirs from a food runner and he looked at us and I said \"three steamed,\" he acknowledged and appeared to go in the kitchen to retrieve three orders of white rice. Five more minutes go by and the server comes out to ask if all is going well and I let her know that we still don't have our rice. She goes and retrieves it immediately and once again, the manager comes out to apologize for the service.

I just felt from the beginning that our table in particular may have been an afterthought. I can tell that was observed at least to some degree by the staff with the two apologies from the manager. It might not be that way for everyone as I certainly hope the manager isn't walking around apologizing all evening.

If you're wanting a nice dinner out with friends, you can fare better at other options nearby for the same price point."}
{"text":"I go a few times a week for lunch, which is very inexpensive.  For $3.75 you get a nice assortment of tempura vegetables and fish, small salad, and a little ball of rice.  It's just the right amount of food for lunch and you absolutely cannot find anything cheaper nearby."}
{"text":"Definitely one of the best sushi restaurants I have been to in Scottsdale, AZ.  Rivals some of the sushi restaurants back in San Diego, CA.."}
{"text":"I've been to Kyoto a handful of times through the years... it's an Old Town Scottsdale staple.  Whether you're looking for sushi or hibachi; you're dining solo or with a group; you can find what you're looking for here, but you do have to choose between the sushi side and the hibachi side of the restaurant.

I've been for both and neither has blown me away, but if you don't have extremely high expectations, this place really is A-OK.  Service is attentive and somewhat quick.  Prices are moderate, but if you're eating sushi, it can add up quickly!

I do like Kyoto as it's not your typical Old Town scene; it's a bit on the older and more casual side, which I like.

Some highlights from my last meal (and keep in mind that I'm pregnant, so I had to go with all cooked fish this time):
-edamame
-salad with japanese dressing
-futomaki roll
-caterpillar roll

While I'm not rushing back, I don't think Kyoto is going anywhere, so I imagine I'll be returning eventually.  Remember, it's A-OK as long as you don't have high expectations.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"It's been a while. Ok..... Still impressed with the pricing. Affordable for sure. I like the re model. Thought they were building a patio, but maybe not. New windows were cool. Not sure how to describe the service. Server, blah and I mean pretty blah. Doesn't mean she did a bad job. Just blah. Can Kyoto invest in server uniforms? We still had a good time. Will be back. Hope they will take a hard look at the service that they provide."}
{"text":"Great service, great food, greater prices. I always sit at the sushi bar and they've remembered me since my first time in. 5/5!"}
{"text":"Went here for a girlfriend's Bachelorette weekend - So fun!  But then again, we'd have fun at a gas station.  It was about 100 degrees out at night - and there were many a dude sportin' fancy, expensive convertibles driving by (possibly hoping to pick up a drunk bachelorette?) - parts of Scottsdale ooze money.  Good food & drinks."}
{"text":"My life has never been the same since Ayako of Tokyo located at the Biltmore Fashion Park was shut down. However, Kyoto of Scottsdale has to be the next best thing for Sushi and Saki B's. While the trendy \"A Crowds\" are dumping loads of cash on high priced drinks, mediocre sushi and snobby service, I am stuffing my face silly at Kyoto. Don't expect fancy frills here just damn good and inexpensive eats.  Itadakimasu"}
{"text":"While I'm a sushi fan, my husband is a sushi FIEND - we made biweekly trips to his favorite haunt in NYC (Monster Sushi) and if he was on his own for dinner, I could always count on him to be there for a bite.  After relocating to Phoenix, he'd been jonesing hardcore for non-commercial, non-fussy sushi in epic proportions served with a smile.  Our trusted source told us that Kyoto was their favorite and we had to indulge.  The mixed views on Yelp made be a tad nervous, but I like to give places an unbiased chance.  Very glad that I did.

The interior of the place is a little strange given the shape of the restaurant and lack of windows, but we made ourselves cozy in a table next to the sushi bar.  I also did not notice a pre-club atmosphere - it was chill the night we went, but maybe it was because we went after work (which is probably on the earlier side for the see and be seens).

No teppan for us that night - it was all about the sushi.  We started with a pleasantly savory miso soup, flavorful seaweed salad and moist, tender tako (octopus) salad.  Next was my favorite dish of the night (and no, not traditional for sushi, but whatever) - a peppered, seared tuna with onion sauce.  Divine!  I could have had three plates of this and called it a day.  Most of the folks in our party ordered rather classic rolls, while I ordered an additional three specialty rolls (Candy Cane, Ichi and Shrimp Tempura - I love to crunch it out).  The rolls were so HUGE we struggled to eat it all.  Keep in mind that those specialty rolls are massive, particularly the Ichi (should have been called Ichi the Killer Roll) which you could barely eat with chopsticks.  I was a mess of dungeoness crab and spicy tuna by the end of the night, but I was happy.

Price was absolutely fair for the quality of the food - there are many (MANY) overprices sushi places in Scottsdale and many dirt cheap places in the valley.  This one charges fairly and keeps the quality up.  I don't ever mind paying if it's worth it.

Will most definitely come back and hopefully take in some teppan next time :)"}
{"text":"Awesome lunch specials for crazy cheap.  Greta sushi as well. Never had a bad experience."}
{"text":"The food is very good, but service is horrible. The waitress was concerned on carrying a conversation with the cook, than serving us."}
{"text":"Awesome and QUICK service plus prices are great."}
{"text":"Don't come here service sucks and so does the food the tablet they take online orders with wasn't charged had to wait twenty extra minutes bfor my take out chicken teriyaki had no chicken sushi was ok but hostess attitude was garbage done with this place"}
{"text":"I never Yelp review but this place is too good not to! First off food is absolutely delicious and don't even get me started on the sake. Service and management are some of the best you will receive. Manager Jesus is not only professional but truly understands the quality of everything to be the best. Would highly recommend for date night or drinks with the boys/girls. Friday tradition has been going strong for 5 weeks now!"}
{"text":"Really?  Teriyaki Chicken with a side salad and rice for $3.50?  Oh, and its good?  Seriously?  I was amazed at how cheap their lunch specials are and even more amazed that it was actually quite good.  The chicken was soft moist white meat with a tasty teriyaki sauce and mushrooms.  I really enjoyed the sauce, because it wasn't sickeningly sweet or heavy.  The salad was as simple as they come... just some iceberg lettuce with a surprisingly flavorful dressing.  I am not sure what the dressing was made of, but my best guess is some combination of peanut, soy and ginger.  Very tasty!  It was really the perfect amount of food for the lunch hour.  I walked away full and satisfied, but not so full that I had to fight the post-lunch food coma."}
{"text":"Kyoto is now one of my favorite restaurants. I took a date there late on a Saturday night - it was perfect! The food was delicious, the cook entertaining, and the ambiance unique. I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"5 stars for lunch options and value, 2.5 stars for lunchtime sushi.
4 stars for dinner, 4 stars for dinner sushi.

This place has two faces - a simple and incredible value during lunch (4$ tasty lunch bento boxes...are you KIDDING?), and then a full blown, non-corporate teppan-yaki at night.

I definitely tend to notice a difference in the quality of the sushi between lunch and dinner with the latter being preferable.  Dinner options are delicious and great fun, but the amazing dimension Kyoto brings to downtown Scottsdale are its lunch offerings.  Seriously, they're good, and under 5 bucks.  That alone makes it worth the trip!"}
{"text":"Absolutely loved this place! Staff is super friendly and management is great. Loved the food and the vibe of Kyoto. My boyfriend is not a fan of sushi but there were plenty of items he enjoyed off the menu. Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"The only sushi place I go to during non happy hour times.  The sushi here is really good and affordable.  I highly recommend trying this place out.  I would give it 5 stars however the wait on a Saturday night was over an hour and staff at the time look like they could be working at a Texas BBQ place (not an insult, as they were friendly but just unexpected for a Japanese restaurant.)"}
{"text":"I've been going here for almost a decade now.  I love it.  Great prices, great sushi, great chefs.  They have lots of ingredients, including some of the more rare ones like kampyo.  I almost always order a couple of rolls made \"my way\"...all veggies!  YUM!!!!"}
{"text":"We had a huge birthday party here for a friend. We took up the entire right side of the restaurant. The plumb wine was great. I had the sashimi and a roll and i regret it. I ate wayyy too much. 

This place is pretty nice but I like some other options in the area a little better. There are a lot of sushi options in the scottsdale area. The best sushi place I had in the valley had to be near Ahwatukee."}
{"text":"The sushi was bomb but the sashim was so bad I actually did vomit in their bathroom the squid was not fresh at all and the hamachi was sour tasting."}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots in in town. The good it's always good and the service is tops. I recommend the salmon volcano roll if you are on a date. She will be impressed when that comes out. The parking has valet do that's another plus for dates. Me and my girlfriend did the teppan so I recommend that cause the chefs are really skilled and the food is delicious. The price for this place is very reasonable since you are in Scottsdale. Guys if you need a place to go and want to impress your date go here."}
{"text":"Best sushi in Old Town.  A part of me does not want to give Kyoto great reviews in fear that it'll take me a few more minutes to get my sushi fix.  For the first 2 years living in Old Town I thought this place was closed down.  The shutters are always closed and looks dark in the outside but I'm very happy to find it open.  I've only had the sushi and not the tepenyaki.  Like what others said, prices are very good for Old Town and quality is good.  It's 10,000 times better than Ra.  Granted the atmosphere isn't hip but you're there for the sushi, right?  If you want atmosphere go to Ra."}
{"text":"They say Sushi bars are more about the decor and the swag than the food and boy did this lovely place in old town Scottsdale live up to the expectation! Our itamae (chef) was very pleasant and delightful. He kept cracking jokes whilst showing excellent skills with the fork and the slotted spoon. The menus is good with decent prices. We had 2 rolls, 2 chicken entrees and 3 drinks for $45. I felt the food was mediocre but I'd overlook that in lieu of the wholesome experience, plus I am not a huge fan of sushi anyway. All in all, it was an awesome experience and I would recommend this as a must try for a night of dining fun!"}
{"text":"Can't believe I haven't written a review for Kyoto - I used to go to this place at least 3 times a week when I worked in Old Town Scottsdale.

I've only been there for lunch, and you can't get a better deal.  I would order the #3 lunch special - Chicken Teriyaki & Rice - for $3.50.  Yeah, you read that right...$3.50.  You get chicken, rice, salad, & a few orange wedges - perfect portion for lunch, and it's almost cheaper than bringing your own lunch to work!

The only downside to this place is that if you get there a little after noon for lunch, the service slows WAY down.  I once waited nearly an hour for my food when other times it was out in as little as 10 minutes.  I know places get busy, but they are always busy for lunch, so I'm not sure why they haven't figured that out yet.

They have other items on their lunch menu which includes some sushi, pork, and of couse some more chicken variations.  HIGHLY recommended if you are in Old Town Scottsdale for lunch!"}
{"text":"Best fried rice in town! Been coming here for years and the new ownership didn't miss a beat. Same authentic feel and the sushi was very fresh. Again, hands down the best fried rice I've ever had!"}
{"text":"$6 pint of Kirin and sake.  Sake bombs galore!!!  This is their doorbuster deal to attract customers.  It really works because I see every table have several orders of these (multiple by 5 if college students).  This deal is 5 stars alone!

Onto the next important topic: Teppanyaki.  This is the other main attraction at this establishment.  I'd say it's 90% show and 10% taste.  The show is outstanding.  I've been to a few of these teppanyaki restaurants and Kyoto receives the best award for being the most entertaining.  Unfortunately, the food is less desirable.  A medium rare steak is overcooked and without flavor even when sprinkled with their seasoning.  The chicken is dry even with the sauce glazed on top of it.  The scallop and lobster were meh too.

Overall, the $6 sake and teppanyaki showmanship will make a great night with friends."}
{"text":"Take the word \"bowl\" away, and it goes from crap to awesome.   

Very Benihana in nature, but I thought the food was superior to Benihana, and, best of all, $4 for a 22oz Kieren and sake.  Awesome deal.   

Of course, the table-side entertainment was fun.  They set the table on fire and made a volcano out of an onion.  Fun stuff."}
{"text":"I am so done with this place, it is truly a dump. The coworkers love it for some reason and I think it's mostly the lunch prices. You get what you pay for. Dust on the windowsills. The dishes they serve the sushi on look like they fished them from a dumpster.  I've tried the sushi, the teppan, and the bento style lunches. All were unremarkable. If all you care about is a cheap lunch, by all means go here. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"So happy this place reopened!  They're under new management and I am l loving the changes that have been implemented.  We took advantage of the hibachi table and our chef, Ivan, was not only professional and pleasant but I couldn't put down my fork.  I was already in deep with a food comma but I just couldn't stop.  I had the chicken and my boyfriend had the lobster, both excellent.  That fried rice though... nom.  We also had a couple of sake flights.  The desert sake flight was my favorite, I didn't even know pear flavored sake existed.  You can't go wrong coming here from the sushi to hibachi you will love the experience."}
{"text":"Great sushi for a very reasonable price, my friends and I love going here. Although on the weekends the wait can be very long and the small bar overfilled with patrons. The host could be a bit more friendly, but we've been willing to overlook that for the food."}
{"text":"I was hoping that they would've revived this place.  The music is 80's, the photos on the wall are 80's and stop with the 10 TV's non-stop showing pictures of your food!  So tacky.  The floors are greasy and the smell of the grill is terrible.  The food is fair,  but super salty!  The staff was very sweet and they tried really hard.  This place could be a goldmine with better management.  Perfect location...would love to see it turn around!"}
{"text":"This place rocks for Sushi and for saki bombs. It isn't the best sushi I have had, but it does the job whenever we are in scottsdale. The service is really good. They have a lot of choices for sushi lovers! The wait sort of stinks during the busy hours, so keep that in mind."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever! Once walking in it took waiter 15 min to even talk to use. We then ordered our main course and that took 30 min to get to us While waiting to get our main course we ordered a sushi roll. Then we received our main course after being there 40 min. My chicken also had a bone in it when I was eating it. Then waited for sushi for a hour and a half after being there. Then decide to just cancel the order because it took so long to get the sushi. The portions were small and not filling. I would much rather go to any other sushi place than this one. Will not be going back ever especially since I drove two hours to come try it."}
{"text":"Great little place. Good service and good show

Had teppanyaki - always good

Can't speak to the sushi."}
{"text":"I actually don't care if the food is good at this point, the service sucks. From the minute I walked in to this very moment this shit sucks. Went to the bar to order a drink because nobody took my order at the table and the bartender told me it wasn't happy hour. The menu clearly says happy hour from 9p-close. After he realizes that it's happy hour, he fails to give me my change. Yeah I would never ever return here again"}
{"text":"Got to revise my review. Wrote a few months ago that the quality had slipped, but they are back to their old strength, and then some. Awesome sashimi! Besides the usual (tuna, yellowtail etc,), they had Marlin and Mahi today - wow!
Service has always been great, by the way."}
{"text":"Should have learned my lesson the first time after I ordered a noodle dish and they prepared it with the wrong noodles because they were out of the proper kind. Just received a postmates order for lunch, I ordered the Chicken teriyaki bento box. The chicken was a frozen chicken breast that had those fake grill marks on it, not appetizing whatsoever. Never Again!"}
{"text":"Went here for fathers day with my husband, 3 kids and two other adults. At first we were slightly frustrated because we had a reservation and still had to wait about 20 min, not as easy a task with 3 tiny humans. However, once we were seated they more than made up for it. I asked the hostess for some plain paper and pencils for the kids to draw on and she was more than happy to help out. The other staff brought out little chopstick helpers which the kids were thrilled they could use chopsticks for their food. The chef, which I think is the reason why we had to wait was for him - was TOTALLY worth it. He entertained the kids and even cut up their food \"Mini\" size, which is GREAT when you want to eat and you don't have to spend time cutting up their meat or veggies to smaller pieces. He even gave us some extra fire at the end per the kids request. The staff then brought out little light up heart necklaces for the kids too - which just made the night even more memorable. It was a wonderful dinner and fathers day and was great for the kids who were soooo entertained, we had just a great time. 

As for the food - it was great, cooked how we liked it, well seasoned and well priced. The staff was on point making sure we had everything we needed, never ran out of water or drinks - they were extremely accommodating. This place would work for a different night out with adults or definitely if you have kids because they are well entertained. Already planning on taking them again for a fun dinner out."}
{"text":"I haven't visited for lunch - which apparently I am missing out on based on the reviews below! 

Anyway, I have been twice for a dinner and it has been sub-par.  Most recently I visited this past weekend 8/24/13.  Sure, they may have the cool fire and loud, clanging spatulas - but it seems like more gimmicky than anything; I would take Benihana over Kyoto any day. Also, the staff we had both times were also sub-par.... which truly fulfills the need for this restaurant to be rated \"Meh. I've experienced better.\""}
{"text":"Some have called Kyoto a classic in terms of a true Scottsdale tradition. 

I happen to be a friend of some guys who have sent their daughters to ASU and everything about that tradition loses all of it's appeal once your age hits 29 or your IQ hits 101.  If Scottsdale can be said to be full of people who either live at Club Med or work for Club Med, Kyoto is their kind of place. Loud, cute, semi-drunk and more impressed with itself than anyone ought to be.

That said, just like most trust fund girls, all the teeth are straight and the diction is perfect. It's all very wholesome and lovely, but something about it just strikes you as a bit too..hmm how shall we say.. brightly colored. If you happen to be a man who has survived any one of the four great tests of American manhood (child custody, IRS trouble, felony conviction or heart attack), then this is the kind of place you should avoid. That is because it is chock full of people whose idea of grave danger is being unable to BS their way out of a DUI ticket. If you frown in here, or order whiskey, they're like \"Dude, what's with him?\"

So my advice to the gentlemen of age and wisdom is to steer clear, if only because you're going to find yourself staring very hard at women young enough to be your (dumbass) daughter, and that's a very icky feeling. 

On the other hand, if you answer to 'dude', all I can say is \"Duuuuude!\""}

{"text":"We've now dined here a few times the past couple of years during our Scottsdale vacations. We keep giving it another try. The 1st time was not bad. Each time since, it has become progressively worse. I'm sorry, but the food has been below mediocre in our most recent visits.
For example, on our last visit a week ago, the taste and the texture of some of the sushi rolls was dreadful--like they had been made at some earlier time and had been sitting in a refrigerator for a quite a while. Another roll--one of their specials--just tasted like a gob of mayonnaise. In yet another specialty roll, the shrimp tempura within was stale and tasteless and overdone.
Well, we have now given up on this place.
To be fair, my rainbow roll was very good, and the sake flight--as well as the fellow who presented and discussed it--was excellent.
But overall, this place is much much inferior to the several Japanese restaurants we frequent--in several different states."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to get sushi in Arizona.  Their prices are very reasonable and the sushi is very fresh.  The cooking table is fun too if you'd rather have some cooked stir-fry type food.  I'd recommend eating there before 7 pm, because it gets really crowded anytime after that."}
{"text":"This is my favorite sushi/teppan place to go! I'm so happy they have re-opened!! Our dinner last night was great as always. I highly recommend the crazy roll."}
{"text":"i eat a lot of sushi and teppan. this is one of, if not the best sushi/teppanyaki joint in phx.

the sushi is meaty and delicious and well-priced. not fishy tasting at all (\"fishy\" means \"not fresh\"). the only negative is their selection is lacking a bit.

the teppanyaki may be the best of any places i have been to. soup and salad come with the meal. the soup is not miso soup and i dont really care for it. the salad on the other hand . . . best citrus-ginger dressing of any japanese restaurant. the filet is seriously like butter. only thing is, there is no filet + scallops combo -- you have to get the ny strip to get the combo. i suppose you can ask but i didnt. the only other negative is that they do not make the fried rice at your table, they just bring you a bowl of it from the kitchen. come on, thats part of the draw of teppan!

also, their lunch is amazing! for less than $4, you get a box lunch with entree/meat, salad, rice and orange slices. best deal in scottsdale. wish i still worked across the street."}
{"text":"this review is for their lunch. One of the best values hidden in old town Scottsdale. I had their sashimi plater. for $8 you got 9 pieces of fresh sashimi, rice and salad. I have also tried their kautsu lunch and that is a steal as well."}
{"text":"This place is a treasure in Old Town Scottsdale! Consider yourself lucky if you need a cheap lunch in Scottsdale because this is as good as it gets! 

I LOVE their sushi and lunch specials. $3.95 for a full chicken terriyaki lunch, with salad!! I guess they don't believe in inflation? These prices cannot be found anywhere else...ESPECIALLY NOT in old town. 

Their rolls are unbelievably cheap too! I had an order of oysters one day and it was...AMAZING! Once again...cheap oysters that are fresh and served on a plate of ice. What more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"Deliciousness - 3/5
Happiness - 1/5

It is so disappointing how bad this place is as I love teppanyaki cooking and the show that goes with it. And the food here is just fine. The fried rice is tasty and not greasy. The meats were cooked to perfection, though I could have used a bit more flavoring. And the price is reasonable enough ($30-50 for the teppanyaki options). 

But the show was lacking for sure. The cook simply refused to interact with the table, not even answering questions. I am partially paying a premium for the show, and there just wasn't a show to be had. A few flips of cutlery at the beginning and then he had his eyes glued to the grill after that. It also took about 30 minutes from ordering for the cooking to begin, that's a long time to wait.

And then, the payment was a mess. We were a party of four. One of us paid $40, one of us paid $50, and the other two paid over $150.00. Why? We have no idea. The restaurant failed to give a detailed receipt of what could have led to such disparity in the bills, let alone two bills over $150.00. We then discovered that they ran our cards multiple times for differing amounts. And we received no apologies, no explanation, and just brusque answers to why they kept taking our cards. I remain convinced that they charged the entire table to the four of us, even though we were not there with the others dining at the table. When I asked to speak to a manager, they just gave me the restaurant's phone number and said to call back later. 

I'd recommend going to a happier place for the experience than Kyoto."}
{"text":"My husband and i have visited Kyoto many times prior to the recent closing.  We were very excited to return as our experiences have always been positive.  What a disappointment!  I ordered a Grey Goose vodka martini;  they did not have Grey Goose nor any premium vodka.  The fried rice was brought from the kitchen rather then made on the teppenyaki table and was tasteless.  We ordered scallops (received 2) and the chicken and steak were just ok, certainly not worthy of the $38.00+ cost. The chef, although nice enough, did not have the skill to pull off this type of cooking. .."}
{"text":"Sushi rolls are decent. The salad you get with lunch is chunks of iceberg lettuce. Portions for lunch are good"}
{"text":"Yummy!!!! We really enjoyed our visit - didn't realize Kyoto's had been closed for two years and had only recently reopened two months prior. Very enjoyable!"}
{"text":"My wife and I enjoyed our dining experience at Kyoto, and although there was nothing significant to complain about, it just didn't offer the flare and excitement of some of the Hibachi/Teppanyaki dinners we are used to. The building is aged and decor is dated, which takes nothing away from the quality of food, but unfortunately doesn't do much to contribute to the ambience. 

The chef's performance was a highlight, he was talkative and efficient and funny, just as we would expect. Unfortunately the food was just different from what we are used to. Fried rice wasn't as buttery and soft, and the veggies were just too \"mixed\". I suppose we may just be guilty of enjoying our southern, buttery, goodness from the Carolinas. 

Overall, Kyoto provided us a good dining experience, just not at the top of our \"must dine at again\" list."}
{"text":"Amazing service. Very accommodating and awesome sushi roll.  really loved the spicy tuna roll, vegetable rolls, and crispy shrimp appetizer"}
{"text":"Went during the day yesterday and was reminded why I don't do that more often. The lunch special was cheap, but shrimp and whitefish lacked the whitefish and was basically just deep fried slices of potato and carrot. The sushi was dogshit and the service was worse. 

Getting menus was a chore, the edimame had no salt on it and when I asked for a side of salt, they brought me another shaker of table salt... what kind of place serves edimame and doesn't have sea salt or kosher salt? We drank a lot of saki bombers just to cope with the horrible food and service. Their saki smelled like nailpolish remover, but we couldn't tell when we mixed it with beer... anyway, it got the job done.

Every time I've tried to go here for dinner, they are packed and the wait is an hour. The staff is rude also. Silly me, I'm such an asshole for wanting to eat at your shitty restaurant.

As a sushi joint, this place blows - especially with so many better places within walking distance... including Ra (yes, Ra is better). On the other hand, as a tapanyaki restaurant, this place is pretty good. I suggest making reservations with a large group. It's not the best place for this either, but it's decent and conveniently located.

Kyoto has been around for ages and I've always recommended it to friends. Truth is, this place isn't so special. Never has been. It's possible to go here and have a great time and decent food, but there are more reliable places around."}
{"text":"\"Real Japanese cuisine\"  
For all those that think Teppan style is authentic Japanese food I hope my yelp opens your eyes.
 Don't get me wrong I love to eat with a group of friends at Kyoto.  But know that the Teppan style cooking is an authentic tourist trap created by a chain restaurant owner in Japan.  

The Review

I like the Kyoto bowl for but a good Japanese food.  The chiefs create a great experience and atmosphere and the Sushi is pretty good.  I have eaten here a few times, and have had a saki bomb here or there. I learned the hard way how power full the drinks are so use with caution."}
{"text":"Had an issue with cross-contamination of foods on the Teppanyaki grill, which caused me to get e-coli. I was very sick the night after. 

I had the steak and shrimp. My steak was cooked next to someone's chicken. Additionally, the steak was very cold when it was served to me. 

When I spoke with friends about my experience, they told me that they either had the same issues or knew of others who got ill. 

My suggestion is to go to Benihana instead if you are craving Teppanyaki style Japanese cuisine"}
{"text":"Probably wouldn't return. We were pleasantly surprised on Saturday night when we called and the had Teppanyaki table available for 2 at 8 pm (only 1 hour from when I called). When we arrived at 745 we gave our name and the hostess looked for us and clearly didn't find our name but said \"we will seat you closer to your reservation\". We grabbed drinks at the bar... bartender was fun, talkative, and never let our drinks get low. The bar area was very crowded and not comfortable area to sit long term. At 830 the hostess came to get us and it was much more apparent they hadn't written down our reservation as they attempted to sit us with a full table in the corner up against a bookshelf. The hostess realized this was not going to work and sat us solo at a grill. We then waited until 940 for our chef to come to us. The show was half as exciting as everyone around us. My filet was over cooked and the other food was sub par."}
{"text":"Great place for lunch! The price and the quality is excellent. It is not the best sushi in the area, but the lunch menu is very cheap and has some good options. They offer different teriyaki meals that come with rice and a salad for around 5 dollars. It is also pretty filling and sometimes I will get a roll or two to go with it. 

When going for lunch the service is usually pretty good. There can be a longer wait at night and the prices go up, so I would definitely suggest trying out Kyoto for lunch if you are in the area."}
{"text":"So, we sat at a teppanyaki table, which seats like 12 people. So, they don't do separate checks but force you to split it into 4 checks at most. And then, they screw it up by putting some things on one bill and then other things from the same person on a completely different bill. So, if you don't want to spend an hour on your Friday night while people try to figure out who owes who what and trying to get the server to give you a bill that's even slightly close to correct, well, then don't.

The food is fine, about the same as Hon Machi in Chandler, or that place on Elliott in Ahwatukee.

They get two stars because when I pay money, I'm paying for service. Otherwise, I can stay home. There's a reason McDonalds is cheap ... it's because you're not paying for service."}
{"text":"I love this place.  The food and the chef were great!  But even with new owner, the restaurant hasn't changed or been updated in 20 years.  
It could use an update.  
A modern overhaul with the same food would serve this place well.
It may be \"iconic\" for Scottsdale but that beaten down look, won't draw people in."}
{"text":"There is something about Yelp that compels me to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help me God.  So before I get to the bad, I'll tell you about the good. Kyoto is so fun.  I've been going there for years and it's pretty much a guaranteed good time- especially if you sit at a cooking table.  Keep in mind that the cooking tables really fill up quickly, so if you're looking to get one for a larger party for a Friday or Saturday night, you definitely need to get that reservation in early on in the week. Smaller parties can usually be squeezed in to the tables without thaaat long of a wait.  

The environment is always lively at Kyoto- maybe it's the sake...I don't really know. But this is definitely not the spot for a quiet, romantic dinner.  People are always yelling, laughing and talking very loudly here and it's often the scene for birthday and graduation celebrations.

In fact, when it's your birthday, they bring out something I can only describe as a washcloth shaped weener with a cherry on top. They also sing and give you a coffee mug that has pictures of sushi all around it.  

I got this mug a few years ago and after a few shots, found it so funny that I became absolutely determined not to lose it during the night ahead of me. I somehow (and I say this with great pride) kept that mug in my bag the whole night and still have it today.  

I think the food is good at Kyoto too and the sushi is pretty decent.  But the fried rice is what dreams are made of.  Try it and you'll know what I mean. My best friend and I used to go to Kyoto some nights before we went out and sit at the bar with a drink in one hand and a bowl of fried rice in the other. Forget the cooking tables- that's all we needed. 

Now I have to end this review on a bad note, but keep in mind that although it took me about a year to return after the 'incident,' I still did return nonetheless and still go to Kyoto on occasion.  This happened probably five years ago, but I will never forget it. My friend and I ordered sake and were pouring it into the little sake glass when we noticed something black had poured out with it.  A horrified little peak into the glass revealed it was a large, hideous roach! AAAAARGH. It still freaks me out. The glass was thrown and we made quite a scene, but upon telling the bartender, the only response he gave back to us was \"well, was it alive?\" DOES IT MATTER? 

He comped us two gin and tonics and sent us on our way and that was that.  I know from working in the service industry that all restaurants and clubs have roaches, it's just a fact of life. You can do your best to maintain it, but those little bastards keep on coming. I don't completely blame Kyoto or think the place is infested with roaches but it still was a little traumatizing for someone that is deathly afraid of those hideous monsters.  It took me awhile to return, but I still go, I just won't order the sake. If you do, please do me a favor and look in the little sake bottle before you pour it."}
{"text":"Stopped by for some sushi in old town at this place on the corner...had reservation at 10 pm but they sat us down at 850 pm (not at teppanyaki table) which we wanted sushi anyways. Their baseline products were very fresh and very good!! Started with their Hakushika sake which we had 3 bottles...was really really good and went well with their sushi!! Started with their soft shell crab and it was amazing!! Their salmon was fresh, beef sashimi was spicy and unbelievable!!  I would come back for that alone!! The albacore was really fresh...the uni was super fresh!!! When everything came out it was really pleasing!! I honestly will come back to bring my dad for the beef sashimi...different and amazing!!"}
{"text":"Fish was fresh-new sushi eater loved the candy cane roll!  Friends found the having to write the order ourselves weird."}
{"text":"I've been going to Kyoto for years. This place is great for lunch. Good food at a great price. Very low prices considering it's in Old Town Scottsdale. They'll even let you take out sushi unless it's a zillion degrees and your health may be at risk. Try any of the generous lunch specials, which come with rice and salad.

At night, try the saki bombers at a low price before you take off to the other bars. It's a great way to get your night started."}
{"text":"This place is excellent price wise and has a decent variety. My only complaint is the setup of the seating...check it out...

ABRA..."}
{"text":"Food was great, chef was great but the waitress was awful. The place was not busy at all and we never got refills from the server, never got asked by the server how our meal was, and we're given the bill until 40 minutes after we were done eating. It was brought by another server."}
{"text":"3.5 stars! After eating Pure Sushi, I'd say it doesn't have the freshest raw sushi -- and it doesn't have the best Americanized sushi. I did like the caterpillar roll as well as the tuna belly nigiri. The fried rice was tasty, however, because I like spicy, I'd add some Siracha to add an extra kick to it. It makes me crave tomato fried rice. The scallops were also good, however, I've had better ones at Roka Akor (although the one here is better priced for sure!) My other friends love this place. I think if I come here again, I'd opt to get the Salmon volcano roll -- I hear it is superb!"}
{"text":"Bad...very bad.  Went to this place for dinner on a Sunday night.  I felt pretty comfortable when I saw how crowded it was inside.  It doesn't look like much on the outside.

The sushi tasted pretty good, and it was cheap.  One of my dining partners and I both suffered the next day though.  I felt like crud.

I don't know what it was that got me but I suggest you run, don't walk, away.  I should have known that cheap sushi is generally (not always) cheap for a reason."}
{"text":"The BEST sashimi in the valley! Ask for belly-cut yellowtail; so tender and juicy! They also have teppan tables that are fun to sit at if you're with a big party. The filet and scallops are delicious, the marinade compliments both of them. There can be long waits on the weekends, but it's definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"Cheapest bento box lunch I've ever seen. Under $4??? And $6 for a sashimi bento box which includes 9 pieces of decent sashimi (3 tuna, 3 salmon, 3 yellowtail). Such amazing prices! 
Boyfriend likes the fish katsu, which reminds me of nicer fish sticks, and I had the pork katsu which was not bad, but not amazing. Next time I would get the teriyaki or just the sashimi. Overall, very nice service  - they had no problems splitting our tab with the other person we went to lunch with - and pretty decent food for the price. Definitely a great choice for a cheap and filling lunch."}
{"text":"My home away from home....seriously!  I used to eat here three times a week when I lived in AZ.  The owner/service is grrrrreat!!  They treat everyone like family :).   Definitely come here if you love sushi!  For larger parties and events, they also have Teppanyaki in the back room.  

Their menu is soooo reasonably priced and absolutely delcious!! My friends and I would come here before going out as well....can't pass up the $4 saki bomber specials...!!!!"}
{"text":"Teppanyaki seating with eight, 4 adults and 4 kids. From reviews, realized restaurant was just re opened a couple weeks ago. Redone dining room with some minor cosmetic updates. Never went to this place prior, but seems like a slight update. Entertainment from \"chef\" was a bit light. Not as embellished as expected. No real theatrics and did not make fried rice at table, came from kitchen in bowl. Seemed a bit out of sequence, salad and soup at same time, then shrimp app, vegetables, then seafood, then proteins. No ice cream at end, we may be spoiled at the  restaurant we go to at home. Food was all ok, nothing overly memorable."}
{"text":"Great place for hibachi and definitely worth a try for their sushi. The tables can get a little tight with a big group,  so be prepared to get really cozy with your neighbors. The chefs are awesome and highly entertaining. Sushi chefs definitely know what they are doing and the bartender was hilarious. Definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"I love this place. We come here every year for our anniversary or for a birthday. They are remodeling right now and will be open in February. This is much better than any other teppanyaki restaurant in all of Scottsdale. It is worth the wait."}
{"text":"Iv been coming here since the late 80's, Masa the owner is a frend ,the service is great the atmosphere is great  , the food is execelent . thia place was the only Japaneese resturant in Scottsdale . it's the grandaddy of them all . There was a time I used to go there 3 times a week . This place is an institution in Phoenix  .Try it you will be pleased."}
{"text":"I'm a regular here. I always enjoy the crab rolls and of course the filet..... Mmmmm melt in your mouth pieces. Consistenly good ****"}
{"text":"Outstanding service from Nuko...The rolls and sushi are of great quality considering the price. You must try the point break and the candy cane rolls -They are to die for. You can eat well for two by sharing sushi and rolls for approximately $ 42 + tip. Love this place and think it will become my go to sushi place - They also have the teppanyaki tables which I haven't tried yet."}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE! I've been eating at Kyoto for years. The service is good, the food is amazing, and the atmosphere is chill. 
My friends and I go here and love sitting around the table for teppanyaki because the showmen are really funny and entertaining. 
I will keep going here and I will always name Kyoto first in my recommendations for great sushi places."}
{"text":"I am actually shocked I have never written a review since I have been coming here for 15+ years. I wish I could give more than 5 stars! 
 
There is nothing I don't love here.  From the amazing lunch bento boxes that are very decently priced to the sushi and teppenyaki tables.  Sitting at the sushi bar is the way to go!  All the guys back there are awesome and fun to watch.  Brandon is the best! 
Group nights you have to do the teppenyaki tables! Entertaining and good food.  I have had many birthday celebrations growing up at those teppenyaki tables. 
I am such a creature of habit here but I can't help it - I love it!!  My go to's: Tako Salad (the spicy ponzu is heaven in a liquid - I want the recipe!), house salad (also obsessed with this dressing - best in town) & Crazy Roll (Shrimp Tempura and Spicy Tuna - you cant go wrong) get it with a side of the spicy ponzu and its a party in your mouth! My dad always gets the salmon kama and its so delicate and perfectly cooked.  Something new to the menu that I now love is the crispy rice with spicy tuna.  I could go on and on.  Just come try for yourself."}
{"text":"Went for sushi and cocktails on a Friday night. I don't have much to say about the cocktails. I had a gin martini. The sushi was superior. The fish was extremely fresh. Rice was cooked perfectly. The yellowtail had been flown in that morning and it melted in my mouth. The eel sauce balanced the saltiness of the soy. (Note: They even have gluten free tamari.) The ponzu sauce in the seaweed salad was rich with flavor. Not oily. Texture was spot on. Ambiance was a retro 80's Japanese vibe. Don't turn up this little gem. Considering the location, the prices were comparable with other sushi places in the area. Will go back again for sure."}
{"text":"So glad this place reopened.  Great service, amazing food, and fantastic ambiance.  Can't wait to come back with a big group of friends for teppanyaki."}
{"text":"My go to place for sushi.  5 because the price is right.  Point Break roll will rock your world.  Bartender is a really nice guy.  Ambience is old school and is a nice break from a lot of the sushi spots in old town."}
{"text":"Service is amazing! Food? Delicious! Nice place. Will definitely come back to have my birthday here! Sooooo good!"}
{"text":"We went pretty late at night with a big group, and the service was amazing! I think our main waitress was named Maria and she was super thoughtful, polite, and joked around with our rambunctious group. The manager (I assume) also helped our table out with drinks, utensils, etc. 

We were seated quickly and checked on regularly. The chef who cooked our teppanyaki was awesome too. The food and drinks were super good (I loved the miso soup), but the service really stood out to me. It can be hard to make sure everyone at a big table always has what they need, and the staff here really went above and beyond.

I would definitely come again!"}
{"text":"Kyoto is back after a long renovation and its as great as ever. Many of the same chefs and staff and all of the same menu items and recipes. The Volcano Roll and Vegas Roll are 2 of our favorites . It's high quality sushi at a reasonable price. And the same local ownership service experience abounds."}
{"text":"First the valet tried to force us to valet by telling us he needed to back our car in. I asked him why? Am i required to park backwards? He said no, i need to back it in so i can pull it out easier. I said is valet parking required in this lot? He said no, to which i responded i didnt valet so youre not pulling my car out. I understand it was slow and he wasn't getting any tips but i didn't appreciate someone trying trick me into something. When we got there we had about an hour n a half to eat n get to our movie. The service was slow, it took forever to get any food and they only brought out one item at a time. We sat there for a long time with empty plates before the next came out. We ordered 5 things so it took a very very long time and they had 4 or 5 sushi chefs and it was not busy. By the third i had to ask them to see what was going on because we had a movie to catch. The food was pretty good though. Aside from that our waitress only checked on us once at the end of the night and the plates were pretty visibly worn. Which i know I'm anal but it bothers me. Get some decent plates they shouldn't be full of chips and wear. The manager comped me for taking so long with our food but i dont care about $10 I care about good service. Overall not a good experience. Pretty disappointed because i used to go there a lot years ago and i told my gf how good it was and they made me a liar lol. I wouldn't go back. Good sushi places are a dime a dozen now and if im eating raw fish id like to see that they take their job seriously."}
{"text":"Been coming here for over 20 years and prices have hardly changed.  Great fresh sushi at the lowest prices around. 5 big pieces of fresh Tuna for $5 and all hot lunches under $5 as well. Has a very interesting night life on Friday and Saturday and $6 larger Japanese beer and sake."}
{"text":"One star for the most terrible service in recent memory.  Our server \"DK\" was outright rude and horrible, and outright ignored us when she wasn't making us uncomfortable.   As a former waitress of 14 years, I have the utmost respect, patience and tolerance for my former bretheren - but this woman needs to go.  BAD DK!  Otherwise, our Teppiniyaki (sp?) chef was wonderful, the food was delicious and fresh and a solid four stars.  I have been going to Kyoto since 1995 and it remains a fun and festive place with very reasonable prices.  Too bad it was ruined this time by DK!   DK needs a different job, more suited to her personallity, like euthanizing kittens or something."}
{"text":"They don't cook the fried rice in front of you.  The scallops are the sandiest I have ever tasted...almost not edible. The vegetables tasted like...vegetables...minus flavor. The soup was salty. The salad was...ok. There is nothing desireable about the teppanyaki experience. The sushi looked good. I won't ever know if it is because I have no desire to go back there. Since there are other restaurants that have amazing sushi...I won't be back. Last, the server, was sub par and didn't deserve the tip we gave her. Don't go here...there are so many restaurants that are better in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Economical but only so-so sushi...

I had tried Kyoto years ago and found it pretty disappointing in terms of sushi quality, but since it has remained open, I decided to give it another try in case I had simply had a poor initial experience.

I have now tried it twice in two weeks, and it still is a generally disappointing experience. While the lunch menu prices are great, the sashimi quality remains off. The first week it just tasted bland, and the second week is was bland, overly wet and spongy in texture to the point that I was slightly nervous about eating it.

Both times I had the Sashimi lunch special which is nicely priced. Each time, my miso soup was barely warm, and not very flavorful.

The first week I also had a spicy tuna hand roll, which was substantial in size, but totally lacking flavor and spice. The tuna preparation was generally incorrect.

Service was just ok, and both times my server failed to check back with me after delivering my food to be sure it was ok. 

Perhaps the cooked dishes are a better choice."}
{"text":"My first Sushi experience ever when I lived in Phoenix. Still in my mind as the best place I've ever been. Pretty famous place for famous people. I remember the owner being a really friendly guy and there are actually Japanese sushi masters making the sushi."}
{"text":"It's an authentic and traditional Japanese restaurant in the heart of Scottsdale. Wow, talk about an oxymoron. But, hey, I give props to a sushi place that offers more than loud music, vibrant colors and cream cheese rolls. This place is great for a quiet dinner (at least it was quiet when I went) and for enjoying big slices of sashima. 

Granted, I've been once, but the lasting impression I got was that it's a rare find in Phoenix. Downside is you have to cross into Scottsdale to go, so that's what keeps me away."}
{"text":"The service was very quick and the waiters were very friendly. The food was great as well. I wish they had a more detailed sushi menu for people who are new to sushi."}
{"text":"I have come home again. Soft open tonight and back to form. I highly recommend the Jaw Dropper roll, the Spirited Away cocktail, & leave at the weeaboo attitude at the door! Don't come in speaking your anime inspired San and Chan, do bring an empty stomach and the desire to have a great time. Drink and be merry for tomorrow is soon upon!"}
{"text":"I am originally from California and I have eaten at all sorts of sushi places.  For me, when I come to eat sushi, I am concerned about the sushi.  I have read some of the reviews below and don't know why people are concerned about the ambiance as much, or the selection of sake/wine, etc.  

I would say if I were to come here again, I would not order rolls.  Their rolls were so thick I probably needed extra large chopsticks.  Their seaweed salad and sashimis on the other hand were absolutely delicious.  The price was very reasonable for the amount of food that we got.  I would come here again because this is one of the few quality tasting sushi places I have found so far in Arizona."}
{"text":"Eh? Not impressed, I came Years ago and comparing quality I can see standards are fleeting. 

I ordered 3 sushi rolls and I can say im not impressed, all came out promptly however the third was an eel  variety that actually had bones in it. After my first bite and attempt to save my esophagus I was turned off and couldn't finish anything..

For being 8-9 on a Friday I was disappointed there we're more empty tables than not..

Saving grace saki comes with every beer? Yes please!! This may have been my last horrah (sp?)  For Scottsdale dining for some time.."}
{"text":"This is one of my go-to lunch places since it is one of the few restaurants in the area besides Quiznos , Chipotle or the food court at the mall where you can get a lunch for under $10.  Actually, it is under $5.  Serious value!  I love the bento boxes, everything is always fresh.  I usually get the teriaki chicken since I don't like fried so much or sometimes when I feel like a splurge I get the sashimi.  Either way it is always good."}
{"text":"Point break roll - awesome!  Soft-shell crab - best I've ever had!  I love Kyoto!

With choices to sit, eat, and drink at 1) the bar, 2) tables, 3) teppan table, and 4) sushi bar - you can live it up in many delicious ways!

Located near other good sushi places, this one you may not see from the street.  So I think this place is more known by the locals, and oh so good.

Very nice service, and less pretentious than the others just up the street.  I recommend this for a couple on a date, or a small group.  The teppan table seats 6 or 8, which is also fun for a little party, anniversary, birthday, etc."}
{"text":"Sushi: 2/5
I ordered softshell crab maki roll and another maki roll that I can't quit recall the name of it.  Kyoto's softshell crab roll was salty and excessively over-battered.  At first, I blamed myself for soaking my sushi in too much soy sauce but bites after bites; I still tasted salt even when there was no added soy sauce.  Last piece, I separately tried the softshell crab by itself and all I tasted was salt.  The other roll was consisted of several different types of fish folded with a central piece of avocado.  The roll was served deep-fried in a pool of sauce.  A tint of sourness of their sauce was a surprising taste and quite unique.  However, I was not impressed.  The creativity was appreciated but the execution needed some more work.

In addition, I found their menu(s) very confusing.  Kyoto's main menu only lists tappenyaki items.  They also have a separate laminated sushi menu that was given to us to share among eight people?, which only contains a few maki items.  I was very confused when I was also given another different sushi order menu that lists additional nigiri and maki rolls in their own acronyms.  How many hoops do I have to jump through in order to get my sushi ordered?  The acronyms without any descriptions were worthless to be given to the customers.  They were nothing more than scribbles on a piece of paper.

Tappenyaki: 3/5
I can't judge on how good the food tastes but I sure enjoyed their impressive performance.  The flaming volcanic onion, the fire surrounded the teppan, the style and technique of cutting with their aciculate knife in a blink of an eye.  Unfortunately, the show was the highlight of our dining experience at Kyoto restaurant and hopefully the food tasted as good as the performance.

Service: No Star?
Dian, our server, despicably greeted us with her agitated facial expression as we asked for our separate checks soon after we were seated.  She scowled as she informed us that there will be a 20% gratuity on our bills because the large number of party.  Everybody gladly agreed and acknowledged.  What remains bothersome was the fact that she was paid 20% of our combined bills to do her job, the job she was already paid to do.  With her attitude and incompetence, she sure did not deserve her tip.  Servers are supposed to be motivated to provide great service with the tip they are receiving at the end of their customers' meals.  I usually don't mind paying for x% gratuity when I am with a big party but this is a perfect example of how one takes advantage of the system.   

The night didn't just end with just her grumpiness.  Just out of a friend's curiosity, he asked Dian politely if the restaurant carried Inarizushi.  Dian ignorantly replied, \"I do not speak Japanese.\" I just didn't believe that came out of our server's mouth to a customer that was paying for her atrocious service.  Not only she was ignorant as a waitress at a Japanese restaurant, she could easily come across rude and offensive.   And yes, the rudeness and grouchiness went on the whole night, from the beginning to end.

Parking and etc: 2/5
Kyoto is located in Old Town, Scottsdale, which is probably the only good thing this place has to offer.  It is close to those who are looking forward to the night life in downtown Scottsdale.  They also have their own private parking lot, which is definitely a plus.

However, Kyoto didn't appear to be that busy as we arrived and we still waited for at least half an hour, perhaps more.  By the time we were seated, there were many guys and girls in their mini black dresses sitting on the benches and overflowing the bar area.

Leaving Kyoto with an extreme disappointment, I was surprised how Kyoto is surviving the recession with such poor food and their horrific service.   This restaurant is by far the worst I have tried in Scottsdale.   So, do not waste your time and money because there are many other strong candidates out there in the area.  Overall, Kyto deserves 2/5 with no star in service in my opinion."}
{"text":"Kyoto is what I like to call the \"diner of sushi places.\"  This isn't necessarily a negative.  The prices are very fair, and the atmosphere is very laid back.  

In an area of super \"hip\" sushi, it's nice to have a place with a local feel.  If you are looking for fancy, out of the box rolls, exceptional service, or a great ambiance, this isn't the place for you.

If you're looking for cheap, good, normal sushi at a great price it's worth a shot."}
