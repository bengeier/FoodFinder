{"text":"Stopped by on 3/25/15, I found friendly smiling faces inside and learned there is a new chef this season.  My experience yesterday leads me to believe there will be many 5 star reviews after mine and I will be back often.  The menu had 6 grilled cheeses that are always available and 2 specials.  I got the special French Onion grilled cheese, it had carmelized onions, with Swiss and side of Jus.  I am a foodie and this grilled cheese had a higher power involved in its creation."}
{"text":"I'm updating my review so that I can respond to David, the owner of the Melted food cart, who has a lot of feelings.

Hi David,

I'm sorry you don't like Yelp. The truth is that consumers like Yelp because it allows us to seek honest evaluations of stores and restaurants in advance of a purchase, saving us from having to wager our hard-earned money on an unknown experience -- whether or not that wager is on an indie or corporate business (my money does all spend alike.) It also gives us a voice, so that we can share opinions we think are valuable with other consumers. 

What business-owners like about Yelp is that it is a meritocracy; good reviews and good establishments float to the top, as the aggregate of responses gradually eliminates outliers. Your business has 4-stars. That means that there is a good chance that my negative experience(s) are just those very types of outliers, the weight of which decrease over time.

In light of this reality, it probably would have been better for you to either ignore my review, or else respond with only this section: \"It sounds like my employees may need a refresher on how to make crispy, chewy, gooey grilled cheese sandwiches to my specifications, which I am happy to do. Know this, my number one goal as the proprietor of MELTED is to make sure that my customers leave satisfied and come back for more. If we are failing in this regard, then we need to step up our game.\" 

Instead, you alternately whined and berated me, accused me of participating in a scam against local business, and swore at me. Seriously? 

You claim to wish I had sought out an owner and then admitted that you aren't usually present on-site (never mind the fact that carts are grab-and-go, and if something goes wrong with an order during the weekday lunch rush, the customer isn't likely to know until they're already back at work.) 

You accused me of not caring about your business and not understanding the subject at hand, while conveniently ignoring that this was not my first disappointing experience at your cart. 

Your response was a roller coaster ride of invective and bad customer service that bizarrely ended with an offer of free lunch (no thanks, you sound scary.)

Please do retrain your staff on the jalapeno popper sandwich; the one I had was awful. If you want to be contacted directly about bad experiences, try posting a sign to that effect with your contact information. If you're worried about supporting your family and 4 employees, don't alienate customers by attacking them. But mostly? Educate yourself about Yelp's algorithm and the culture of the review community. Attacking your reviewers was never going to be a good plan, but if it was that or nothing, had you known more about Yelp you at least might have made the wiser decision to leave the review alone and let it be buried if it was an outlier. 

In the meantime, I guess I now have a crazy story to tell about your cart, instead of just the memory of a bad sandwich, which I had already nearly forgotten. Your response is a lot less forgettable than your sandwiches."}
{"text":"I wish I had liked this place, it's a nice concept and the people who worked there seemed really nice.  But $8 was pretty expensive for a small grilled cheese sandwich (I ordered the one with bacon and tomato), especially with the following problems:

-The cheese on my sandwich was NOT MELTED.  That seems like a basic requirement for a grilled cheese place.  I ate half right away because I was too hungry to wait, was super disappointed, and put the other half in my bag on the way back to the office in hopes that maybe it would melt a little more if it spent some time wrapped in tin foil.  The outside of the sandwich and the bread were nice and hot/toasty when I got them, but it clearly hadn't been cooked long enough to melt the cheese.  After 10 minutes on my bike at least the cheese not longer had a cheese slice shape, but the bread had gotten soggy so it was a no-win.

-It's late August and I had just returned from a farmers market full of beautiful, ripe, local tomatoes.  The generous tomato slice on my sandwich was from a mealy tomato that tasted like it came from a grocery store in the middle of winter.  I try my best support to local businesses and am thankful that there are lots of awesome options in Madison, but I think they should support local farmers, especially during times of year when produce is cheap, very available and incredibly delicious.

-The bacon was not cooked long enough (think white soggy fatty goo)

I'd already walked a block or two away by the time I took my first bite and was too hungry and too lazy to return and complain about my sandwich by the time I discovered the unmelted cheese.  I hope that others don't have similarly disappointing lunches :("}
{"text":"Willy (on grill when I went) makes some of the best grilled cheese I've ever had. I was particularly impressed with the Southwest Bacon, and he was very accommodating of my requests for extra everything.

The staff is funny and kind and always seem happy to be there (which is a big plus for me) 

At first sight I was a little hesitant to spend $8 on my sandwich, but it was 100% worth every dollar. 

Would recommend, would definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"Best grilled cheese ever! Melted set up for an event I hosted and even provided a special grilled cheese named for the event. My personal favorite so far is the jalepeno popper, but I can't wait to try them all!"}
{"text":"Since moving to Wisconsin, I have been searching for good grilled cheese sandwiches.  And, Melted certainly fits the bill.

I had the American Caprese sandwich, and it was a solid sandwich.  The pesto and tomatoes added a nice tang to the flavor.  I thought it was better than the grilled cheese at the Old Fashioned and Coopers Tavern, but not as good as Monty's.

All sandwiches come with a shot of tomato soup, which is not particularly remarkable.

The drawback was the price.  The basic sandwich is $6 and the specialty sandwiches are $8.  That was steep for a small, food-cart sandwich without a side.  In fact, I went over to Ian's right after for a slice of pizza to make a full lunch.

Again, the sandwich was quite good.  However, I would prefer to buy a slice of Ian's mac and cheese pizza and a slice of caprese pizza and a bag of puppy chow for the same price."}
{"text":"I just tried Melted for the first and last time. I work a couple of blocks away and walked there at lunch time.  I have several food carts in my rotation. Banzo is fantastic but alas, it wasnt there (darn the luck!).  Good Food is also really strong but it was after 11:15 AM and I didn't have time to stand in their well-deserved line..  So I stopped there in part because there was no line and the other carts seemed kind of busy. I ordered the special which sounded great - cream cheese, cheddar, bacon, and  jalapenos.  The whole time I waited I was their only customer - not a great sign. When I got back to my office I found that my sandwich was burned. In fact, my coworkers were even asking what was burned. I guess i didn't smell it outside. 

Melted would probably get 4 stars if they hadn't burned my sandwich to a crisp, as the bread and other ingredients seemed high quality, and it's nice that they give you a shot a tomato soup for dunking. However, for me the fact that they did, in fact, burn it to a crisp, AND that they had to know it since I was their only customer AND they had nothing to do but tend to their one customer AND they let me walk off with it means they just don't give a crap. Which is no bueno.

I try to be the guy that tells a manager about a bad experience so they can fix it rather than venting on YELP, but if you see the food is bad and you send it out anyway, people should know. And then people should wonder what else Melted doesn't care about."}
{"text":"Excellent grilled cheese! Recently visited Madison, and tried both the standard and caprese. I preferred the standard. Also great customer service. They can get busy so be willing to wait a little bit."}
{"text":"To quote a classic favorite movie, f**ck me gently with a chainsaw. This was fantastic. I have had minor experiences with Melted before and have been happy, but when I finish a long day of work and walk home to find a cart outside Gibs (special event...not the norm) you have no idea how fortunate I was. If the food had been poor, this review would not exist. However. My grilled sandwich was amazing, and not just because I had one drink nearby. The girls working the cart were so nice and so adorable, I'd come back just for them. I work in the service industry so that means a lot. The grilled sandwich I had was perfection. Perfectly melty and executed perfectly. I'm Italian and cook 100% of my meals at home, so it's hard to impress me to five stars. Keep it up, everyone! Fantastic."}
{"text":"I love Melted. Their grilled cheese are made with high quality ingredients, and I go often. The jalapeno popper might be the best grilled cheese I've ever had. 

The only downside is they're a little pricey--but then again, it's a small family owned business, and so is most food on the capitol."}
{"text":"Delish!  Fun and yummy grilled cheese sandwiches that come with a shot of tomato soup...what's not to love?  And bonus, it's a food truck."}
{"text":"I honestly love this place and wish they had a permanent location downtown (outside of lunch hours, as my lunch hour is a little weird sometimes).  May I start by pointing out that their selection of grilled cheeses changes periodically, with the exception of some very popular choices and the always available \"Standard\" with Cheddar, Muenster and Swiss.  My favorite, when it's available, is the grilled cheese with apple and havarti (this could have been seasonal?).  This is straight up comfort food in a food truck. Their tomato soup is thick and perfect, the sandwiches are perfectly grilled and gooey. Plus, soup and sandwich costs like $8.00 which is more than reasonable for eating downtown. The service is always upbeat and kind, they obviously love what they do, and they go out of their way to make sure you're happy, which means... you have no reason to not be happy.  I can't really complain about any of the food trucks here in Madison (we are pretty damn fortunate here), but this is one I'll rave about forever."}
{"text":"Grilled Cheese is one of my food groups. Grilled Cheese, Cheese Curds, Mac and Cheese, Cheese Pizza...you may notice a trend. Seeing as I'm slightly obsessed with all things cheese (especially all things \"carbs + cheese\"), the Melted truck has long been at the top of my \"MUST eat at\" list.  A couple of weeks ago I finally had the chance when I was up on the Square during lunch time. I chose the Jalapeño Popper Grilled Cheese, which is made with pickled jalapeños, sharp cheddar, cream cheese and ranch drizzle. I was pretty excited, because one upon a time I made a similar grilled cheese at home, and it was quite fabulous (if I say so, myself). Unfortunately, I was left totally underwhelmed, longing for my homemade sandwich.  Here were my issues...

1. The sandwich was small. Really small for $8. I know it's a grilled cheese, but...I just felt like for $8 dollars (and considering it's considered \"gourmet\") that it should look a little nicer. But, nope. It looked like a pretty run of the mill sandwich. I've seen some complaints about burnt sandwiches, and while mine wasn't burnt, it was sorta close. It's obvious that they need to cook these sandwiches quickly and probably have the heat up pretty high on their grill. It didn't have the nice \"browned\" sides of a sandwich that had the luxury of being cooked slowly.  I wonder what they put on the sides - oil? Didn't seem like butter...

2. \"Pickled jalapeños\" really means \"pickled jalapeño relish with other stuff in in.\" Like carrots. I'm sorry, but carrots have never been an integral part of the jalapeño popper, so why are they in my Jalapeño Popper Grilled Cheese?  There was also a LOT of relish...way more than the sandwich needed. It was kind of awkward.

3. This one is a really bad complaint. I know it. I'll probably get made fun of...but...the cream cheese...I think I was expecting your run of the mill processed Philadelphia-type cream cheese. This was not that. You know how cream cheese has this sweet, rich taste to it? This cream cheese almost had a goat cheese like taste to it. I was looking forward to a spicy/rich combination...and it just didn't happen for me. I'm sure this was some super natural, locally made amazing cream cheese. I kind of just want the fake stuff. (Hanging my head in shame.)

4. Was there even cheddar? Or ranch drizzle? I honestly don't know. I didn't notice them. The whole sandwich was just peppers and suspect cream cheese. The flavors didn't meld together at all. I only ate half of my $8 sandwich.

So, this is kind of a scathing review, but I'm still giving Melted three stars because a) they were crazy quick to answer my questions on social media regarding their hours and location, b) the employees were very nice, c) they had bottles of Dr. Pepper (yes!), and finally, just because I didn't like the one sandwich I tried doesn't mean they are bad all around. I would like to try again...and I'm hoping to come back and bump this up a star or two."}
{"text":"Melted serves delicious speciality grilled cheeses with fresh and quality ingredients! The sandwiches are on the expensive side but worth it! I've also always had excellent customer service!"}
{"text":"I recall two friends of mine trying Melted at Taste of Madison last year and being left unimpressed. I never tried Melted until now. I ate the gold standard sandwich from the Melted food cart today, and I, too, was left unimpressed.

The bread was cooked nicely and had a nice crunch. The sandwich appeared to have no seasonings, though, as it was simply bread and cheese. I was expecting much more considering Melted's \"The Cadillac of Grilled Cheese\" slogan. My sandwich from Melted was no different than a grilled cheese I make at home.

A concern for me was that I paid $6 and received a standard grilled cheese sandwich, sliced in half. I've paid similar prices at other Madison-area food carts and got much more bang for my buck. 

Madison has a lot to offer in terms of food carts, but Melted will not be at the top of my list of favorite food carts.

NOTE: To address the comment from the owner posted on my review, I drafted my review on a Thursday after eating at Melted when it parked at the Demco lot, but I did not officially post my review until a Friday. When posting on Friday, I failed to edit my \"today\" to \"yesterday\" in the first paragraph."}
{"text":"Melted brings a bit of home with a food cart experience that doesn't disappoint!

The owners and staff are one of the friendliest out of the food carts around Madison. I felt very taken care of the whole time, and I enjoyed getting to chat with them about the cart while they prepared an order of sandwiches.

Let's get something straight, Melted provides simple grilled cheese sandwiches. It's a simple concept, but Melted executes it with finesse. Each sandwich has a small but unique twist to it that makes it just better than what you could make at home. The ingredients are high quality and each sandwich comes served with a small cup of tomato soup. Unfortunately when we visited, they just had run out of tomato soup!

The prices are reasonable, and the sandwiches are great. The bread was toasted to golden brown perfection. This made for a sandwich that was easy to chew and enjoy. I thoroughly enjoyed my simple yet delightful meal.

Melted's strength is also its biggest weakness. The concept is very clean and simply executed, but it left me wanting more. There is not much culinary innovation here, but if you want a delicious snack without having to think too much, Melted is the perfect food truck for you! The best part is they are kid friendly!"}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch on national grilled cheese day and took them up on their special of a build your own. I went with pepper jack, muenster, and swiss with tomatoes, onions, and ranch.  It was a good grilled cheese, but the bread was a little too greasy for my liking.  The little cup of tomato soup on the side was a nice surprise.  It had me wishing that I would have gotten a whole cup of tomato soup as opposed to just the little bit! I will have to try out some of the other grilled chesses next time. While it doesn't seem like you're eating a lot, this kept me completely full until dinner, therefore definitely a good value."}
{"text":"So I had a grilled cheese from Melted for about the fifth or sixth time the other night and I was going to write a four-star review. I would have said that the sandwiches are very, very tasty, that they are sometimes a little on the greasy side, and that the price is just a little too high. 

Then I read Kell A's review and the response from the owner, David R. I highly, highly recommend that you read his response. It is HILARIOUS. While you should definitely read it yourself, I just want to draw your attention to one line that truly buggers the imagination:

\"You are not a food reviewer, you are not food critic, or a culinary expert, you don't run your own business and aren't an expert in running a mobile business. In other words, you are wholly unqualified to critique any of those things.\"

That's right, customer: You are totally unqualified to judge whether a grilled cheese was good or not. 

I disagree. I think that I'm quite qualified to judge whether or not I like a grilled cheese. And while I like their standard sandwich just fine, Kell A. reminded me of just how awful the jalapeno popper grilled cheese it is. It sounds like a great idea, but the result is absolutely disgusting-- far too much drippy cream cheese, not enough cheddar, and a really off-putting relish that features carrots for some reason. Good lord is it nasty.

Congratulations, David R.: Your decision to berate your customers has cost you two stars."}
{"text":"Let's be honest here; a food cart that cranks out artisan grilled cheese sandwiches is going to get no less than a four star rating from me.  The Jalapeño Popper Grilled Cheese sandwich (extra sharp cheddar cheese, cream cheese, pickled jalapeño, drizzled with house-made ranch on grilled sourdough bread) was one of my favorite bites during the 2014 Taste of Madison.  And I'm pretty sure I'm not the only person who felt that way, the lines in front of the Melted Cart were easily the longest of any booth at this year's event.  

The reason for their popularity is quite simple to understand (and taste):  1) Employ high-quality ingredients and 2) masterfully prepare them.

Melted, which came on to the local food cart scene in 2014, offers up seven standard menu options between $6 and $8.  While expensive, the high quality of the ingredients justifies the price.  Each sandwich comes with a shot of house-made tomato soup.  For those needing an extra blast of flavor, any sandwich can be grilled with garlic butter.  The cart also serves up a variety of weekly specials, so follow Melted's Facebook page for the deets.

A great sandwich requires top-notch bread and Melted does not disappoint - the sourdough was beautifully moist and easy to chew with a mild yet complex flavor.  Grilled to a gorgeous golden brown, it provided the satisfying crunch necessary for a stellar grilled cheese sandwich.

Not so be out done, the perfectly melted cheese was everything I expect from an extra sharp cheddar - slightly salty, pleasantly bitter, creamy and a little sweet. 

I enjoyed the pickled jalapenos but could have done with a little less cream cheese, which made the center of the sandwich rather goopy.

Despite the massive crush of Taste of Madison customers, the folks working the cart were friendly and efficient.  I look forward to sampling more of their sandwiches next time I'm downtown during lunch hour."}
