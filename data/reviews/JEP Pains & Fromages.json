{"text":"I got their macaroni and cheese delivered. It was good! Very simple and classic (which is how I like my mac and cheese). It wasn't the best I've ever had but it was much better than microwave mac and cheese or kraft dinner. I feel like I could've made myself something similar at home though, so not sure I would order again.
It was a pretty big portion for 9.19$ but it was still a bit expensive for what it actually was.

Next time I'm going to try one of their grilled cheese. They do give me a very \"bland\" feel though. Don't order/eat at this restaurant if you're expecting something more unique and creative."}
{"text":"I loved that there were a selections of salads to choose from! We ordered the corn and avocado salad with the mac and cheese Poutine. Both were delicious, but I'm removing one star because I felt they skimped on avocado and pulled pork, respectively. Friendly and efficient service."}
{"text":"I almost feel bad writing this, as I'm writing the first review, but certain items on the menu are borderline inedible!!

I visited the place with a friend, and we took the pulled pork grilled cheese, the prosciutto and cantaloup grilled cheese, a potato and shallot soup (soup of the day), and a corn-avocado-peppers salad.

The pulled pork grilled cheese could have no pork at all and it would have tasted the same. The pork only gave a little mushy texture. In terms of taste, everything was covered up by the sweetness of caramelized onions. By Alabama style pulled pork, it was just pulled pork slow cooked in vinegary sauce.

The prosciutto and cantaloup grilled cheese was a civil war. By that, I mean the flavours simply don't mix. A bite of very salty prosciutto after a bite of super sweet cantaloup isn't my kind of harmony. The clash between the 2 distinct flavours destroyed the grilled cheese.

The corn-avocado-peppers salad was a total disaster. The salad was bathing in vinegar and so sour I couldn't help but make a grimace at every bite. The avocado handled the sourness the best as it tastes rich on its own. The grilled peppers were nicely grilled but were destroyed by the acidity. The corn were probably canned and were totally submerged in vinegar (not edible). It's the first time I thanked the Lord for something as ridiculous as a sip of Sprite. 

Well, that's it for the food: Overpriced for the quality and quantity and seems like the work of a teenage boy trying to impress his 14 year old girlfriend. 

A second star is added for the ambiance and decor of the restaurant. It's pretty modern looking and clean."}
