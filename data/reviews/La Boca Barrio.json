{"text":"I spent an evening last week on their patio with a few close friends and had a great night. Was relaxing and just what we all needed.  We shared a bottle of wine, ordered some tapas and chatted away. Our waiter was very knowledgeable and it made our choices that much easier.   Overall, great experience -  wine was reasonably priced and the tapas were generous but we didn't feel uncomfortably full when we left.  Flavors were bold without being over powering.   Patio has a great welcoming vibe, I could sit there for hours."}
{"text":"I met some friends for happy hour here. The happy hour specials are about average, a buck off wine, beer, and liquor. Plus, there is a $4 tapas menu. The small plates are small, as they should be. To be fair, they are a bit smaller than other Cleveland locations' small plates, but I think La Boca Barrio's sizing is about where it should be. For example, the grilled shrimp had 3 shrimp. We ordered 3 tapas for the three of us, expecting a snack, and that's what we got. Everything was very tasty. I loved my drink, the caipirinha.   We sat in the bar, which was basically empty, which is a shame because the room pulses with vibrant, bold colors that would really come alive with a crowd. It was raining, otherwise we would have enjoyed the beautiful and romantic patio in the back. It is adjacent to La Boca Barrio's free parking lot, but the patio is well landscaped so when you are on the patio, you'd never know."}
{"text":"I had wanted to try this place out since Cleveland.com gave it a decent review. My girlfriend took me to dinner here on my birthday, and the best I can say about that dinner is that she was smokin' hot. The tapas? Not so much.  We ordered the calimari, bacalao (salt cod croquettes), \"chic\" peas & cactus salad, and scallops. The calimari was soggy and very fishy smelling. It wasn't bad tasting, but I shouldn't have to wonder about the freshness. Fortunately, I have an iron stomach. The scallops were tender and tasty, but very gritty, as if they hadn't been washed at all. At least that probably indicates they were somewhat fresh. The bacalao was OK. Crispy fried coating, and soft fish inside, but not very flavorful. I suspect they came frozen in a bag from a food-service supply place. Not what I expect at $6.50 for two small croquettes. The \"chic\" peas and cactus were quite disappointing - most of the bowl was filled with chick peas, which, although not horrible, were obviously canned, not fresh, and a very small amount of cactus, which to tell from the soggy and flavorless texture, was probably also canned.  For desert, three flavors of gelato were offered. The coffee gelato (forget the name) was OK - tasted a bit of freezer burn and the caramel/coffee sauce was cloyingly sweet. I'm almost tempted to buy a tub of Giant Eagle gelato to see if it's the same thing, but why, when you can go to Sweet Spot in Lakewood for gelato made right on the spot? At least we didn't get charged for it.  Our server was friendly and attentive (hard not to as we were the only people in the place), the decor is pleasant, and they do have an excellent beer and wine selection. I had the pear cider which was quite good. This would be a decent place to get a drink, but the food is really just glorified bar food, and overpriced for what you get."}
{"text":"Some of the friendliest staff I've ever experienced in Cleveland. Friday night host is fun, inviting and pretty much let me do whatever I wanted in terms of seating and moving once my friend arrived. The bartender, Shannon, offered a beer, her name, full conversation, all while serving others and keeping me company until I was ready to move. Mr. Host (wish I had asked his name too) also came over and chatted throughout the night. Our server was fast, almost over attentive but made up for it with her amazingly friendly personality. \"my loves\" - her nickname for us all night. Haha!   After taking a quick look at the menu I felt a slight dribble roll down my chin. And I wasn't terribly hungry either. But when you take bread, grill it, top it with prosciutto and roasted red pepper strips you're just begging my future dead body to rise from the grave and hitchhike my bony ass here for some more! Delicious to say the least. Veal meatballs in a Spanish tomato and onion sauce were cooked to a perfect medium and tasty as can be. The eggplant rolled and stuffed with chicken, scallions and gruyere was good. Maybe not a flavor profile that I love but they did nail it in execution and taste for what the dish is supposed to evoke. An old-world Spanish tapas comfort food type thing. Finally the mussels with spicy chorizo and broth tasted like ... Well ... Like mussels and chorizo. Where could you go wrong there? Desserts were ok. The peanut butter cheesecake thingy wasn't great. Not enough of a powerful cheesecake and PB flavor for me.I also thought it was too dense. The chocolate bomb was the bomb! Dark chocolate shell housing dark chocolate mousse with a perfectly smooth texture. Yum! Then the lemon tart. I like lemon. This taste like a creamy lemon and had tart blueberries on top. Very good.   I wish I had a chance to look at the wine list because it looked extensive. Beers on tap were crafty but not out of the staple CLE crafts. Instead of Dortmunder on tap they offered Holy Moses. Good move in my book. I had a Stone IPA or three. My friend had a few Summer Shandy pints and I finished off the evening with ketel one on rocks.   My only qualm with the evening was that the bar area was quite loud. It wasn't comfortable to talk to the person across from me because I felt as if I were yelling in her face. I do want to check out the patio in the backyard and of course try the rest of the menu. Parking in the back lot is good as long as there isn't an event going on. Otherwise search for street spots or you might be okay in Latitude's lot... Not really sure I'd be willing to chance that.   All in all great meal. Thank you, Boca for some fantastic service! I'll be back and will bring more friends."}
