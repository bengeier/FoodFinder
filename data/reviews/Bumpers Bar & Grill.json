{"text":"Got seated in about 20 min. salads right away. Definitely get the redskins!!! Our server Tiffany was great! She kept everything coming fast! Never ran out of crab or drinks. The only negative was the shrieking eels sitting next to us on a \"girls night out\". $29.95/ayce. This place gets my approval! (A little loud thus the 4 star rating)"}
{"text":"Was a little worried going to Bumpers Bar and Grill, because of some of the reviews. I'm not the easiest to please but I must say this place was fantastic!  The AYCE crab was some of the best I have had. Nice, clean jumbo sized snow crab. O and this crab was steaming hot, I mean you had to wait a couple of minutes before you could start cracking..Nothing better than hot fresh crab.Most places you have to wait for seconds or thirds or in my case the fourth serving. At Bumpers by the time you were done with the first plate of crab the next plate was coming out. Salad, corn on the cob, redskin potatoes or fries are also served with the crab."}
{"text":"Went here on a Saturday for AYCE crab legs. If you are going for this, make sure to get there early to get a seat! The crab legs were delicious and you can't beat the price! Service was also very good. We never had to ask for more crab, the server just brought it right out when she saw we were just about done. There was also someone who came by and emptied our shell buckets often throughout the meal. Drinks were always full. They do a great job for as busy as they are! Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Not sure if my family came on a bad night but I wont be back. Crab legs were good but service was slow. Bus boy was more concerned with changing TV stations than doing his job (a table full of shells for 30 minutes) When I asked him if there was a gabage can to dump my shells he became a smart ass. Also saw other people leave quite upset before getting a table. Other places might be more expensive but service is better, also and when there is a 20% tip for 4 or more some of the  staff could care less if your happy."}
{"text":"Hate to give this place only two stars but service brings Customers back out. Food was good crab legs came out in a timely manner but my server's attitude was horrible. From rushing to answer before she listened to the question, not refilling drinks, and slamming food on the table.The manager did turn things around for us. Not sure if I will return. My kids have never experienced service like that before."}
{"text":"We went to Bumpers like most people, for the AYCE crab legs for my husband's bday last year. His meal was delicious. I ordered the prime rib, it tasted literally spoiled, and I sent it back. I got something else instead, the gyro I think and that was pretty decent."}
{"text":"All you can eat crab legs Friday and Saturday,  amazing legs cooked just right everytime and you can't beat the price at 30.00"}
{"text":"Was ok for the price you can't beat it anywhere else in the city much more expensive for crab legs seating may take a while I had to wait 2 hours but I believe it was well worth it some of  waiters were rude and did not bring items that were asked for. I still eat there for crag legs"}
{"text":"We went on crab night .,, all you can eat. Let me tell you they were great steamed perfect every time but the last one. Ill take it.  The bartender was awesome Christie. The hostess/server cause ours was to busy and confused.  She had broken clavicle and was still on top of things.  Bottom line looks little run down inside but basement is nice.  They have good food for great price."}
{"text":"This is a bar with good food. Don't expect more and you won't be dissappointed. Burgers are good, ribs are great. Tuesday night is rib night and is fairly cheap. They also have a great reputation for there Fiday night all you can eat crab legs. Give them a try. you won't be sorry."}
{"text":"Got all u can eat crab legs and they were fresh, large, not salty, and not over cooked like some local restaurants."}
{"text":"Rely good food and a wide variety of menu options, and reasonable prices.  Great place to stop."}
{"text":"Went for a family members birthday. They did not take reservations so had to wait over an hours for a table. Once we were seated server was nonexistent and horrible, not offering beverages nor bringing food out together. They only upside is alcohol is fairly inexpensive. All in all I a pretty bad experience and would not recommend. If you do decide to go for their all you can eat crab legs plan on waiting for a table then waiting the 20-30 min between your next round of crab legs. Burgers were cooked well done and chicken wings had little sauce and may have been sitting under a heat lamp prior to being served. First and last time I will be visiting."}
{"text":"Best AYCE crab legs around and they don't try to fill you up first with butter and bread. Been going here for years, never a disappointment except for the wait."}
{"text":"I didn't have the best experience here on Tuesday. It seems like an alright enough place to go with friends and play volleyball, but the outdoor seating was really quite small and I felt the drinks were over priced while the service was slow.   Apparently this place used to have a great bar and party scene. If that is what you are looking for, just head to downtown Willoughby instead."}
{"text":"Best crab legs in town, and cheap! They pour a good drink for a good price highly recommend this place! There is a whole downstairs bar with volleyball beautifully manicured the place to be in the summer. The daily specials are amazing balls $2 Cheeseburgers w/ff on Mondays 35cent wings on Wednesday and mussels on Thursday its hard to eat home cheaper and tastier to eat out! Most ppl there are regulars because the staff makes you feel at home you'd never alone if you go by yourself very welcoming!"}
{"text":"Love the crab legs. ..a great value.   Karaoke with Scott is the best.   A friend plays volleyball on Fridays,  and we love to watch and then go upstairs to eat,  sing,  and drink!"}
{"text":"The bartender was very rude from the beginning. We felt that we weren't welcome. The restaurant was not busy yet we were told the wait was over an hour. Will not go back again."}
{"text":"I love this place for AYCE Crablegs! Very few times have I gone that I wasn't satisfied with the service, but it's happened. I would have given 4 stars, but I don't think it appropriate they tack on a tip at all, let alone if you have 5 or more people at your table.  I think the few times I've had a rude wait-person, it was tied to the fact the tip was automatic and they felt they could provide rotton service without repercussions. Also, basically, 2 parents and 3 children meet that limit and parent's with children shoudn't be penilized like that. It used to be tables of 6 or more, but they've changed that policy. I always tip; usually 20% if the service was great, 15% if it was just so-so."}
{"text":"Went back for AYCE crab legs again and did not disappoint. Great service, legs come out hot, fresh, and frequently. Got there at 5:15pm on Friday pm and were seated right away. Good beer selection. This is the best spot around for crab legs if you want to eat 5 lbs in one sitting. Only bad thing was the corn on the cob was mushy but who cares about that? It's $45 for the AYCE meal."}
{"text":"This is still a good place to go. Their staff and food is awesome. When you arrive they always say hi, and when leaving they say thanks and stop by again. The only bad thing is, at times one might have to wait due to the AYCE nights for crab legs but it worth the weight. One can tell the cooks take pride in their food. But in the end it's a good place to go."}
{"text":"This place has obviously been around for a while.  It absolutely reeks of stale cigarettes.  I did not witness anyone smoking, so I have to assume that the place just hasn't been cleaned thoroughly since smoking was banned in the establishment.  Very divey, which I love.  Darts and pool tables, and sand volleyball outside.  The place was packed.  I felt like I was in a time warp with the lack of (once again) local craft beers.  So much bud and coors.  I wanked to yack.  At least we sat outside and was able to inhale fresh cigarette smoke."}
{"text":"It's ok for a dive. I haven't had the AYCE crablegs in a long time, but when I did have them they were very good. They came out hot and fresh every time. The beer choices suck unless you are partial to domestics, because that's all they have. The staff is hit or miss; depending on who you get, they can be nice enough or just plain rude. The karaoke used to be great, but now a new guy runs it and it blows. He lets all of his friends go up first, even if they put in songs long after you have. It's supposed to be fun, but it ends up being frustrating and a buzzkill. I suppose I will go back for the crablegs, but not for karaoke."}
{"text":"Still a great place to get great food and drinks.  And killer karaoke!  Great specials on crab legs and burgers."}
