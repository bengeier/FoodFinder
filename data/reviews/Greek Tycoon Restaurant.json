{"text":"Greek Tycoon is the real deal! It's independently owned by a Greek family and the food is authentic. We've been eating there a couple of times a month for the past 10 years and everything is always tasty, hot and good quality. The prices are very reasonable making it easy to go more often!  The service is friendly and welcoming. When we want Greek food, we'd never think of going to one of those chains, Greek Tycoon if ALWAYS our first thought.

{"text":"Hands down best Greek food I have ever had. Me and my fiancé go here once in a while for a date night, we are truly never disappointed. Staff are wonderful. :)"}
{"text":"OPA!!!!!!!    This place is amazing. The food, the servers and the owner are all amazing. They treat you like family...and provide the freshest food around. No more franchise greek restaurants for me. GREEK TYCOON is my #1 choice from now on. A big thank you to Tommy and Margaret.   See you real soon..:)"}
{"text":"This is the only Greek food place in Whitby, the food is subpar. Make the drive to the Danforth if you want Greek food"}
{"text":"Great Family run restaurant, the food is amazing, I highly recommend trying it. Living in Durham and having an option like the \"Greek Tycoon\" is amazing. Don't have to drive into Toronto to Greek town to get  my Greek fix..."}
{"text":"Food is good but service is just horrible. You can definitely get cheaper better tasting Greek food elsewhere."}
{"text":"Went here cause was reading the reviews and they were all good. Wasn't impressed at all, service was great but the food and portion wasn't what I expected for the price. Salad was small and didn't have flavour. Bread you only get the amount for the people you have no extra. Drinks no refill. Chicken had lots of flavour, rice was very small amount, potatoes had way too much lemon. Wouldn't go back. My favourite place for Greek is Milos."}
{"text":"Tucked away in South Whitby lies the Greek Tycoon. A restaurant with a family atmosphere and family sized portions. A classic décor leads to classic Greek dishes and new favourites.   I've been here a few times and I keep going back to try something new. The best part is that you really can't go wrong. The only advice I can give is to stick to Greek food; it's what they do best.    We all know and love Souvlaki and it's damn good. This time I tried the Pasta Medallions. It was ok. I wouldn't try it again. The sauce and pasta was plain. There's so many choices on the menu, I wished I had picked a Greek dish. My favourite is either the Tycoon Chicken(HUGE portion) or the Chicken Shishkebob(juiciest chicken on the planet). Most dishes come with rice, potatoes and mixed veggies.  My mom ordered the Exohico. It's HUGE. She ate until she couldn't eat anymore and it looked like she hadn't touched it. Under the phyllo crust, lay seasoned lamb and a slew of roasted vegetables. The leftovers lasted 3 meals!!    Service is always good. The food is always good. Prices are great.   Can't wait to go back again!"}
{"text":"Came to this restaurant looking for greek food on my way back on the 401. Good little place. LOTS OF FOOD on your plate. Souvlaki came with rice, potatoes, steamed veg, salad and bread. Although it seems that the steam veg was covered with butter, but still tasty.   Decent food at decent price."}
{"text":"Good authentic Greek food, good portion and food was tasty. Was in the area and found this plc on Yelp. Alot of ppl getting take out and 90% full at the dining area.  Saw an empty table, manager passed by obviously saw us but no acknowledgement and didn't greet us at all. A group of 4 walked in and immediately being seated. At that moment I kinda pissoff.  To be fair our table server was very attentive. The manager  - the only one who wear tie (maybe owner) not so friendly at all."}
{"text":"The only reason this review is getting 2 stars is because the food was delicious. The service, however, was horrendous. We watched all tables around us with a different waitress get stellar service, and our waitress, clearly wanted us gone. She didn't greet us at all, except to inform us that there was no calamari left. Didn't take our drink or food order until 10-15 minutes later. We ordered the chicken souvlaki and seafood fettuccine which were both amazing and would return solely for the quality of the food. We spent our entire dining time being ignored by our waitress who didn't offer us any refills or quality check our meal unless we flagged her down. It's clear that because my fiancé and I look young we were an inconvenience to be seated in her section. Wish we got her name to inform all to avoid her. We were hoping for a better experience considering other reviews and that my fiancé loves Greek food. Most likely won't be back."}
{"text":"This place is top notch. It's a family run restaurant with authentic Greek food and atmosphere. All the staff are amazing including often being sat by the owner at the door. Highly recommend a reservation on weekends or busy nights as it is a smaller intimate location. However they do their best to get you seated or you can always order take out."}
{"text":"We had to wait 20  mins for a table on a busy Saturday night, but it was worth it! As previous reviewers have mentioned, they definitely treat you like family. They also went out of their way to make sure we had a great experience and made substitutions for my food allergies. We will be regular customers for sure!"}
{"text":"GReat little Resturant.  DO not judge a book by its cover or in this case the outside of the place.  Located in a strip mall when you walk in top the place it is well decorated, quaint a lot of couples having dinner  here.   I was alone traveling on business but felt very comfortable as the staff here was very attentive.  THe foods is very good and reasonably priced.  I had the Greek Salad, Spanikopia and a piece of Baklava.   All were something I would come back for.  I also saw a few other dishes go by and they looked mighty tasty as well.    I will definitely come back here when in Whitby"}
{"text":"Great quality food at great quality prices! My family orders take out from this location rather often and I can say with confidence that you're really getting what you paid for. I highly recommend the chicken skewers, as they are a respectable size and come with a whole ton of other things as well, such as a whole lot of rice and and really good tangy potatoes."}
{"text":"What a gem this place is. And of course, we got there serendipitously.  So, there I was, leaving the office after a long day of whatever it is I supposedly do, and I get a text \"Why is there no good Greek food near us?\" The wife and I were welcoming a house guest who's just moved to the area from Nova Scotia, and she wanted to go somewhere nice, and Greek seemed to be what she wanted.  So I replied that there is, though I haven't been to the place yet, but not far from where we live in Oshawa sits a place called Chef Tommy's, and it has a pretty good pack of reviews on Yelp. So we decided to go there, not realizing they're closed on Mondays. So, we head a little further afield to the Greek Tycoon.  And it was a great choice. Service was friendly, the menu had lots of options, and the food was amazing. Let me try explaining. First, there was sort of a tag-team of servers, the first took our order including for a half-litre of wine, and I don't know if he communicated it telepathically, but it seemed like the wine arrived almost immediately. Nothing fancy, just the house red, but it was a great pair with my roast lamb.  Next out was some nice warm bread and a couple of dips we ordered, hummous and Ktisomething - I can't remember the name of it, feta cheese and peppers basically.  Follow that a good size Greek salad and before long the mains arrived. Now, here's the thing. The prices looked comparable to a higher end place on the Danforth, but when the food came, the portions were enormous. So enormous in fact that we all have another meal of out them. So basically, I'm eating roast lamb again for dinner with all the accompaniment, and that suits me fine.  We even got a shot of ouzo on the house for the holidays, a nice finishing touch.  Awkward moment when we left though, our guest was generous enough to pick up the tab, and paid with debit. A while later as we finished our wine and conversation, an older guy we hadn't seen, perhaps the Tycoon himself, came to the table, tasked with the embarrassing job of asking if my friend has made a mistake with the tip, as it was only $0.20! Clearly, that was wrong and we fixed it up right away, laughs and red faces following.  So glad that I don't have to trek to the Danforth for a ridiculous Greek meal."}
{"text":"Ordered some type of combo platter good enough for 4 people to share.  Rice, roasted potatoes, salad, bifteki, kebabs, souvlaki... and more.  Food and atmosphere was good. Seems like a  family run restaurant and a solid spot for Greek food in this area.  On my radar to come back."}
{"text":"This cute little place is Family operated. Their Family pride is evident . You'll Love this place. I think it's Best Greek food in Durham and I return with my wife and family whenever we can."}
{"text":"The Greek Tycoon in Whitby is our favourite restaurant.  The food is great, the service is great, the atmosphere is friendly, and we always feel welcome and appreciated.  It is a family run restaurant with Tom leading the way, welcoming guests and checking on customers through their meals.  Staff are friendly, professional and attentive.  Guests are treated like family.  Food is served hot and portions are large - you will not go away hungry and you may take home some for dinner the next day.  Salad is included with the entrees. We always recommend this restaurant to friends.  The restaurant is often quite busy, so reservations are good idea.  They also have a lot of take-out customers - this is very popular as well."}
{"text":"Came for lunch. Restaurant was barely half full. Waited over half an hour for a salad. Safe to say, not coming back."}
{"text":"Phenomenal food, incredibly friendly staff who know how to make you feel welcome and at home. The gyros platter is delicious, the salad that's served with it is outstanding as is the pita. Generous portions for such a fair price. Beautiful  atmosphere with pleasant Greek music, great for a date or a family dinner. I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Drove by this little restaurant for many years, finally decided to give it a try and was very pleasantly surprised!  A very cute little family restaurant, the small space is used to seat many tables but not too close that you don't fell like you are dining with strangers.    The food is very good, fresh and made with care.  I will definately come back and recommend to all who want a nice dinning experience."}
{"text":"I have been meaning to review this place as I had posted the yummy pics of my steak and potatoes over 3 years ago...but it's now or never.  The Greek Tycoon is a very snazzy restaurant with low, ambient lighting (except for the occasional burst of flame and sudden heat with 'Opa!' being recited as the saganaki was being lit).   Nevertheless, I always order the steak and potatoes even to this day because the steak is juicy and I love Greek style potatoes. The salad is pretty good and they give you fresh baked bread while waiting for your meal.  Overall, the Greek Tycoon is one of my favourites in Durham."}
