{"text":"Great place for something light to eat, nice size wine selection, tons of rare and micro beers. Friendly staff, skip Starbucks and support this local business for coffee."}
{"text":"Bad customer service. We came on Saturday afternoon waited for 20 min at our table. The waiter saw us and never brought us the menu. We ended up leaving!"}
{"text":"There's a lot going on here, too much, to be honest. That aside, my review is only for the bar. Fun and engaging staff, excellent beer selection, great happy hour practicing. The beer listing is frequently updated and like they say \"no crap on tap\"."}
{"text":"Before you let the other reviews give you a bias just go in and try this place out. The Angus burger is the best I have ever had. Perfectly cooked all around every sibgle bite was perfect and juicy and even the bread seemed like it was made in house for the meat."}
{"text":"We've been coming here for years, but unfortunately we paid our last visit to this place. Service is mediocre, as is the food. There are people in there setting up workstations being loud and obnoxious on conference calls for the entire restaurant to hear. Servers are smug, which boggles my mind because they're servers in a wannabe bistro. They nickel and dime you on petty things and you're so much better off elsewhere. Unless you like managers with terribly poor customer service and lame ducks serving you. Try Saddle Mountain Brewery and Hanna's Italian Ice in Goodyear instead! They far more welcoming and courteous!"}
{"text":"I can get a drink and do my work someplace closer to my house, like Starbucks, but this is why I kick back with my highlighters and textbooks several days a week at Ground Control: community and coffee.
Ground Control is unique because the baristas aren't trapped behind their counter, unable to communicate more than your order and total. They also serve food, so they are able to move freely, chatting with customers and offering recommendations (about which they are thoroughly knowledgeable). Places like Starbucks don't cultivate a feeling of community and family the way the servers at Ground Control do. I am constantly amazed by how many people walk in and are not only greeted by name but treated as though they only momentarily stepped away from an ongoing conversation with the staff. 
Every time I am handed a plate of food or a latte with a delicate leaf crafted on top, it is obvious how much pride the staff take in their work. The food isn't amazing- just alright, and it bothers me that I have to use the WiFi from neighboring Burger King, but I don't frequent Ground Control for the food or amenities. I gladly trade those things for a sense of community and fabulous coffee!"}
{"text":"Love this place.  They have all the things we want in a hang out.  We work third shift and can always get an early drink or a great meal.  Pizza is great with a beer, and the beer choices are some of the best."}
{"text":"I love ground control, a great local coffee shop. The owner there is so knowledgeable I can simply sit there and listen to him talk forever. The coffee there he roasts himself which gives the beans a taste of their own. I love the gingerbread blended a gentlemen made for me its to die for! :) warm and welcoming staff."}
{"text":"Great pizza and drinks.  Joel, our server, was tops!  Wonderful ambience! Great company!"}
{"text":"Excellent selection of craft beers knowledgeable staff. Entrees and appetizers explode with flavor. The staff is knowledgeable on food and beer pairing. This is not your typical Westside establishment. I would highly recommend stopping in if you're in the area. The beach bum Pizza is an absolute must"}
{"text":"Just got done eating there. The food was awsome however I have nothing else good to say. The place is a dump,  the floor was dirty, the urinal in the mens bathroom was covered with a trash bag the toilet was running and the trash can was overwhelmed. Dirty plastic cups stacked on top of the fingerprinted aquarium that had the electrical power ( 4 wires) coming from an ouletlet from   a booth. The service was slow and there was only 4 people in the restaurant.  The workers who just finished their shift had a social hour with thw people who just started.we spent $90 for artisan food that would have been better served in a gas station. We will not be back."}
{"text":"Great Iced Chai and gelato. Friendly staff. They had live music Friday night too. Will be back to try the food!"}
{"text":"So disappointed...was really looking forward to a good, reliable coffee place near the base. First time the chai was okay, a little on the sweet side. And the second time my drink was awful. Burnt espresso and too much syrup. When I asked to have it remade, the teens at the counter informed me that they \"could not just hand out free drinks.\" If it were a $2 drink that would be one thing, but one would hope a $5 drink would taste right. Not to be too much of a negative nancy, but it was also pretty uncomfortable overhearing the young baristas talk about customers after they left. So unprofessional."}
{"text":"Awesome restaurant. It's super local. The food is great. The wood fired oven pizzas especially. The atmosphere is great. It's really a great place to be on Friday night with all the happy people and great music. They have an awesome selection of craft beer. Their cabo breakfast burritos are a must. We swing by regularly just for these. Highly recommended! The only criticism we have is that the non pizza and burrito menu food can be better."}
{"text":"This should be a 5-star place because the food and drinks are great! I just can't figure out why they don't clean it up a little bit? The tables and chairs are cheap and rock back and forth, there is a disgusting aquarium in the back of the restaurant that everyone hates (just read the other reviews), and it really needs a lot of cosmetic help. I feel like the owners/managers need to go on Yelp and read the reviews so that they can make a few simple changes and turn this into the best spot in the West Valley."}
{"text":"The owners did a great job of creating the essence of a European Cafe.  This is not the place to come if you are in a hurry, but everything is worth the wait.  I come here to enjoy the atmosphere and relax.  Great Coffee, Food, Wine, Beer, etc."}
{"text":"Your place has so much potential ....it looks like you moved in recently and not quite unpacked.  Your menu is good but no cheese boards or Mac &  cheese.  Tried the chicken artichoke pizza, very good.   Great wines too but if you want to have style that will draw crowds in like downtown, you need to finish your decor and not have crates and boxes everywhere.  The west side needs a place like yours so I look forward to some changes.   Your Verrado location is a little more put together."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for lunch and had a great time. Our servers was incredibly nice and checked back with us consistently. Never had to ask for a refill or anything for that matter. The atmosphere is great and very relaxed. Overall great place for lunch or just for drinks. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I really love the food and it's been a great place to go and get work done--coffee, food, wine all in one place! Be wary of going in the afternoon though-- you may have to hunt down your server. The service can be really terrible sometimes--they're fine when they're actually coming around and all, but getting attention can be a chore even when it's practically empty. Service is generally better in the evenings."}
{"text":"Great little place to eat, hang out and have a good time. They do have wifi which is nice, great variety of drinks and very relax atmosphere.  Service was a little slow and the waiter didn't really check in on us much, but when I didn't like my entree, (simply because my taste buds didn't like it lol) I asked if I could swap it out for something else and the manager on duty happily switched it out for me with no extra charge!"}
{"text":"I love Ground Control. The tap list is obviously the best in state. I love this place despite the food (pizza and brussel sprouts are bomb though! ) When we go out we like to eat. Our dining decisions are mostly based off of beer selections. Ground Control definitely wins that every time. I have tried so many food options but nothing is great. It's a great local spot I just wish they would change the menu seasonally and use more local and fresh ingredients. Service is lacking BIG TIME. If we don't get Ian, we usually get crap service. It's unorganized, slow and lots of attitude and carelessness. On several occasions the kitchen stops when the owner walks in and caters to her. ? The beer selection keeps us coming back."}
{"text":"If you advertise that your open until 12am on Saturday then why did I just get told at 10:46 pm that upper Mgmt told them to close early. We try and try to support this local establishment but due to poor Mgmt and customer service, I really don't understand why!!  Yes, they do have a great selection of craft beer but so does total wine.  Unfortunately you can leave it at that......West Valley can do better."}
{"text":"I had the breakfast Cabo burrito, it is delicious and served on a plate with thinly sliced apples, it is a great way to start your day!"}
{"text":"The service was terrible! We waited 15 mins for a seat and then at the table we waited 15 mins and no server!
We watched as the servers just kept passing us up. So we left and went to another restaurant."}
{"text":"Tonight was my first time visiting. I am a big fan of \"little\" coffee shops. Ryan helped us out at the front counter. He was fun and knowledgeable and personable. We tried a Thin Mint iced coffee (latte?...didn't pay attention to the name) and a Samoas iced coffee. They were delicious. The flavor of the coffee itself came through (their Ethiopian blend) and was rich and not bitter like you know where. The prices were great as well. I enjoyed the atmosphere. Very laid back and unpretentious. Will definitely visit again. My only complaint is it was awfully warm inside. Not sure why."}
{"text":"Zero stars. My wife ordered a medium well burger it came out rare at best, did not give me the right food, then tried to charge us for a extra drink, and fries we told them at the start we did not get.  Bad service and they added $10 on our bill for services we did not get. Not to mention we asked 2 separate employees for the manager and after seeing them speak to her she walked by us several times and did not say a word.  Finally the Executive Chef came out to help us with our issues. Tommy was a great help, Lacy the \"manager\" was not so much help with this issue. When my wife informed Lacy that it was taken care of she said she had no idea what was going in. Remember I saw 2 people talk to her and point at us and she looked right at us when being told about our issues by our waiter Chris."}
{"text":"Best coffee beans this side of Stumptown...so unless you got tons of frequent flyer miles to take you to Portland, a drive to Goodyear is what it's gonna take for an absolute 5-star coffee experience

Indeed, Ground Control's slick decor behind its bland strip mall exterior makes this a place where you really wanna linger over your latte.  And the house made gelato is on the high side of enticing.  But the lure that drags me into my car and take that hour long drive down to Goodyear is gonna be the awesome orange monster in the back of the room where the coffee beans are roasted several times a week...from medium to dark, no wimpy light roast here.  Yes, you can absolutely taste the freshness.  My personal favorite is Guatemala Huehuetenango.  With beans this good, I take it black...so smooth you don't need cream to take the non-existent hard-edge off, nor is any sugar needed to counter the non-existent sour off-notes (unlike a big chain competitor).  

And if you end up hanging out so long that you actually need more solid nourishment, then the Mediterranean Salad with the tasty bits of candied pecans and mozzarella is spot on, while the pesto salami panini is not half bad."}
{"text":"We've been going to Ground Control pretty much since they first opened.  Our first experience there was terrible but we gave them a second chance and things greatly improved.  It became our Wednesday night coffee place.  Staff made us feel warm and welcomed and the drinks were great.  We would also occasionally go in for breakfast or lunch and the food was always good.  
And then they moved.  We had really high hopes for the \"new and improved\" Ground Control.  Brick pizza oven, fancy chef, new menu, etc.  I've eaten there once since the new place opened and had a nice salad for lunch.  It was good, but nothing to write home about.  We keep trying to continue our Wednesday night coffee date night there but it's getting harder and harder to do.  Seems every week we see new staff and they never seem properly trained to make a decent coffee or chai drink.  They are often out of key ingredients and are not very knowledgable about menu items.  We keep trying and hoping and waiting but I'm about done with it.  I really prefer to support the local businessman over the mega-mogul that is Starbucks, but I want a pleasant experience too.  Maybe our nice little coffee place has gotten too big for its britches and is just trying to do too much... coffee, gelato, food, beer, wine, brick oven pizza, etc.  Fingers crossed that they get it together soon."}
{"text":"I am so, so disappointed with Ground Control. I went there on 7/7. I've been there many times before and had great service and food. Today was a sign of what I read in the other yelp reviews. There was only one waitress for the lunch crowd. She was new and very, very much untrained. It took her over 5 minutes to come to our table. Water was served quickly but no beer menu. Beer took about 6 minutes to arrive. Then taking our order took another 20. That's because we were talking and she didn't want to \"bother us\". Order took another 15-20 minutes to come out and she served me only. Then brought my friend's about 4 minutes later and it was the wrong order. She then took MY food away and got my friend's burger and brought ours both back. I'd asked for a different dressing for my beet salad and while it was on the side as requested, the salad was still covered with the honey dressing-sugar I don't like. My friend's parmesan fries were barely covered with any cheese and it took her ANOTHER 10 minutes to come around and find out my friend wanted ketchup. She had to go get a little cup of it which took another 4 minutes or so. Finally, after we were long done, she came with a check and explained she had given our check to someone else who'd paid and left. The amount was the exact same but she never asked us if we wanted separate bills (which we did). It was really, really a very disappointing visit. The food was not nearly as good as usual, the service was really below par because there was only one waitress and she just didn't know enough to be on the floor! She didn't know the menu (which had been changed recently so you can't get hummus or some other items anymore). I'm not sure I want to go back. This kind of thing always seems to happen when management decides to let their restaurants die while they get the paperwork done for it to close. I'm really bummed out because this really is one of the only non-chain, decent restaurants in the entire area of Goodyear which has really good beers and wines."}
{"text":"I ask myself why I continue to visit Ground Control...I know why, because I like the owners and I really used to enjoy everything about the place: the background story of how it got started, the service, the food, the coffee & the ambiance. Each time I visit with my family for the past 2 years, I cross my fingers and hope that it will get better...it does not.

Today's example is not uncommon, but finally I'm writing in hopes that either management will attempt to remedy the service or in hopes that others who read Yelp reviews will either bring up their similar concerns or visit other small businesses who truly care about the customer base. 

Arrived at a normal lunch hour, aware of the lunch crowd and possible wait time. No one greeted me when I walked in; 1 server saw me and did not acknowledge where I sat. I wanted to order for my family (who hadn't arrived yet), so I asked a barista at the front if I could take a menu to look over so I'd be ready to order when the server came by.  \"No\". The barista actually said that I couldn't take a menu to look over.  \"Someone will be with you when you sit down,\" she said. As a last ditch effort to dine at Ground Control (because, again, I really want to like this place), I sat and waited. 5 minutes went by. Almost 10 minutes went by with no one coming with either a menu or water or even a glance. So, I left.

Good luck, patrons of Ground Control. You're either loyal to the brand and beer, or extremely patient and forgiving of a group of people who do not care about their job or the Ground Control reputation."}
{"text":"I  been there several times. The food is really good, concept is excellent and the owner is very nice/helpful when he is there. The service is woeful.  Incredibly slow and they forget you all the time. Busy or slow, its always the same. Some of the servers are not exactly personable.  Shame because it could be really fantastic.  If I was basing my review on service alone, it would get one star."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! When I discovered that it had both coffee and wine it was like a dream come true! I'd always thought that coffee and wine would be great companions for a shop, and here's the place to prove it. 

That, on top of the fact that they have superb and friendly service makes this a great place to hang out at. I am relatively new to the area (I just moved to Arizona 3-4 months ago), and have been searching for awhile for a good coffee place where I could chill. By my second visit to Ground Control, I was hooked! I love the relaxed but classy atmosphere, and it's a perfect place to read a book, chat with friends, try some of their delicious hot drinks, or any of their wide variety of wine, and even beer! They also have live music on Fridays and Saturdays, on which they are open till 12am! Now if that's not awesome, then I don't know what is. 

This would definitely be a place I would invite and recommend to friends and newcomers! If you ever get the chance, check it out! I'm sure you'll love it just as much as I do!"}
{"text":"Absolutely the best tiramisu we've ever had. The service is amazing. Beer selection is great and my merlot is so yummy."}
{"text":"I went in Tuesday for a quick drink with a friend and was thoroughly disappointed.  I ordered a Long Island ice tea which is a pretty standard drink but the two young ladies working had to look it up online. Okay, fine, but they were missing a few key ingredients  but served it anyway and it was awful, instead of serving a subpar drink, offer something else. Service was slow too. When we were ready to pay and leave, the waitress was off sitting and talking with some friends."}
{"text":"Fourth time going here. 3rd time leaving agitated. Last time I'll try the place. For the life of me, I can't imagine why they'd continue to hire people who just don't care, don't want to help, and seem bothered by a persons patronage.

Very disappointed as I live so close and there's so few options out here. But, I give up on this place - service is just too awful!"}
{"text":"Amazing place!  Great staff,  food is yummy and the craft beers are numerous! I have never been disappointed when coming here!"}
{"text":"great hot chocolate and biscotti. the gelato rules too. They are always fast and helpful. The interior is great. I have only been their twice but I will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"My mom and I just came back from Ground Control.  Although I know it has real food and not just coffee and gelato... I forget....I have never been so when the Living Social deal came around we jumped on it!  The menu looks great.  There were many things to choose from.  We finally decided on the grilled cheese pannini and French Dip beef sandwhich.  We also ordered artichoke dip to start.  It was quite good, however my mother and i noticed it was missing something... spinach.. we are soo used to having spinach and artichoke dip.  Still very good. both of our sandwhiches were very good.  The grilled cheese was definitely and \"adult sandwhich\" i don't think a 5 year old would appreciate it as much.  We were also surprised by the beer selection and while not intending on getting beer, we both did.  Both very good!!!  To make the experience complete, we had to try gelato.  Neither of us had ever had gelato before.  It was very tasty but we were unable to finish it because we had eaten so much already.  

This place has a very laid back feel.  We enjoyed our server and the front coffee shop girl.  I do however feel like the coffee/gelato shop operated seperately from the resteraunt.  

Can't wait to come back and try the coffee in the AM and the other menu items!"}
{"text":"I have been here before at the old location in Goodyear and was enjoyed my initial experience. However, the last time I stopped by their new location I was unimpressed and a bit frustrated. We arrived in a group of about 5 and ordered lots of appetizers, pizza and salad to share. I am not sure if our server was overwhelmed (there was a large military event going on at the same time) or new but we had a hard time with receiving our beverages we ordered- having to ask multiple, MULTIPLE times- club soda, coffee you name it- it was going to arrive towards the end of your meal. 

We asked to start off with the hummus trio, garlic fries and stuffed crab mushrooms then the watermelon feta salad and farmers market pizza. The appetizers were among the last things to arrive (aside from our beverages we tried to order). Again, possibly a server input error. However the fries, pizza and salad were great! The hummus trio tasted awful not to mention the veggies served with it were frozen! I am not sure if they were placed too far back in the fridge and accidentally froze or if they intentionally freeze their veggies but it was bizarre and not appetizing, we left most of it on our plate. The hummus itself was not fresh as it had that slightly *tingly* mouth feel (the beginnings of the fermentation/expiring process). The only good part was the flat bread served with it. The crab stuffed mushrooms tasted and smelled extra fishy (again a sign of lack of freshness- but what do you expect when ordering crab in AZ). It was not worth the money we spent. 

Lastly, we asked to split our checks at the end of the evening and the server seemed to deem this an incredibly difficult task stating that it would \"take a while\". I waited tables and bartended all through college so I know that it is not that difficult to divide a tab evenly among 5 people. Again, maybe our server was new.... To be fair we didn't give the management a chance to correct things as we kept silent about our issues with the food/waitstaff since we were just trying to enjoy a nice girl's night out and didn't want to ruin the evening by making a huge deal out of everything. Overall- I would just stop by for a quick coffee or wine but don't expect decent food or friendly/efficient service as they both seem to allude this restaurant."}
{"text":"We love this place for a coffee shop but this morning we decided to get breakfast as well. Service was SLOW! There was only one other customer.  We ordered French toast and a yogurt bowl. 20 minutes passed and I had to go looking for our food. Then I had to go look for a spoon for the yogurt. Then I had to go look for coffee refills. HUGE disappointment! Never again."}
{"text":"Gelato - super yum! White coffee is my favorite (but they rarely have it).

Breakfast - great prices and just enough to fill your belly but not overeat

Dessert - Half baked cookie with your choice of gelato on top! Seriously...heaven in your mouth.

Coffee - very strong, if you like medium strength, you need to mention it to the Barista

Ambience - sad and painful to look at. Its like the place is having an identity crisis, are they a gelato bar, a wine bar, coffee bar, lounge, cafe, night club, family hangout...its weird. The place needs a makeover...bad.

Paninis - Yummy but whimpy, just a couple bucks over priced for the amount on your sandwich."}
{"text":"One of BEST CAFE places in West Valley! From friendly baristas, owner can often be seen roasting the coffee in site or checking with guest. Iced Cafe Cubano-love it! And if coffee it's not you thing, the food its in conservative portions but delish! Live music on Fridays & Saturdays evenings. 

Also offers wine tasting & seems to have a selection of wines & beers- but not into any of those so can't comment."}
{"text":"What a fun little place to enjoy delicious food right here in the West Valley!  I was surprised to read reviews about poor service - our service was absolutely excellent!  Drinks were good and the margarita was STRONG (loved it!).  We ordered a table full of appetizers to share and everything was treat.  Gelato and sorbet were delicious as well.  Wish I had found this place sooner, but can't wait to go back again and again!"}
{"text":"I went here with a couple of my friend to enjoy the live music. The music was awesome a girl playing the guitar was seriously the highlight of the visit. We sat down and a waiter came to take our order. We were not ready and asked him to come back in five minute. We were understanding when he forgot to come back in 5 but by the 15 minute mark we started to get irritated. Then we got his attention he came to us and said OK, Ill be back in a moment to take you ladies orders. Another 15 minutes pass and we asked another waitress if she could help, she said let me go grab him... another 10 minutes then he came back and asked what we wanted. We told him and 30 minutes later the food arrived. By then we were done, the place was not busy and at the very least you can say \"I'm sorry about that wait\" . Eventually my friend spoke to the manager and she never even said sorry.I can deal with the fact that he forgot but to not even apologize... Ruined my experience."}
{"text":"I have been going to Ground Control for several years and am giving it two stars because I have always been very happy with the coffee, gelato, food and alcohol choices. However, EVERY SINGLE TIME I walk out feeling frustrated. I want so badly for this business to \"make it\" because there's nothing else like it in the far west valley, but as others have mentioned, there are so many unfinished things inside, and there seems to be an identity crises with the decor. More importantly, the quality and efficiency of service has been terrible most of the time, and I can say with absolute honesty that every time I go in they've run out of something that I order. I keep trying it, hoping the things have changed, but am beginning to think I should just stop hoping it'll get better."}
{"text":"This place is kind of a mess. It can't decide if it's a gelato stop or a cafe or a wine bar or a British pub or a nightclub. I don't understand the sad looking, half filled aquarium either. The wine flights are great, and the cheese board was nice, but the pizza was lackluster, the hummus bland, the quesadilla had no flavor. Instead of a nice salsa we got hard sour cream, a pico de gallo that looked days old and some kind of Thousand Island something sauce."}
{"text":"Great tasting Chipotle Wings for our appetizer,  recommended by our waitress. Our meal and drinks served to perfection and a cup of Italian ice for dessert. Nice atmosphere. Will plan to go back."}
{"text":"Visited today with my family, for Sunday brunch.  I'd read the mixed reviews, and was  prepared for delicious food but possibly sub par service. Totally not the case! As soon as we walked in,  the woman behind the coffee bar told us to have a seat wherever we'd like.  Before we even got to a table, (our kiddos stopped to gaze at the huge fish tank), we were greeted by our waiter, Tyler. He gave us menus and took our drink orders. He quickly returned with the drinks, and since I didn't see coffee on the menu,  I simply asked if I could order some from the table. He said yes. I asked what he recommended,  and he made some suggestions. I ended up ordering a \"Cafe Roma\", which he brought within minutes. Delicious! We each ordered something different,  and it was all delish! I must say, the food here is excellent! Throughout our visit, Tyler was very attentive and polite. He even made small talk with our kids, which is always a plus! He was on top of drink refills and brought us some to go boxes (big portions!). I'm very impressed. 
We were very pleased with our visit! Delicious food, family friendly and great service!  DEFINITELY will return!"}
{"text":"Awesome place with a little bit of everything! Nice big space with coffee, gelato,and wine,and AMAZING food! My daughter and I went there for lunch, and we'll definitely be back. Perfect size menu, not overwhelming, with great choices. We had the cheese curds, that were fantastic. Cooked perfectly and came with an amazing beer cheese sauce. Then we had some wings and pretzel sticks,that were incredibly delicious. I also noticed the table next to us had a tasty looking sandwich they were just raving about, I'll be trying that one next time. Overall it was a wonderful experience at Ground Control, so if you're looking for delicious and inexpensive, I highly recommend Ground Control!"}
{"text":"Despite a stellar beer list, and what looks to be a delicious and unique menu, I cannot promote this place. I have wanted this place to be good for so many reasons, but they fall so short in food presentation and taste and fail miserably in service. I have visited Ground Control more than 10 times because it seems so promising, but every single time I've been there, I have had to wait extensively to even be acknowledged after sitting down at a table, and then again to have my order taken and then throughout any meal for any other service like napkins or silverware or a refill on my drink. The food has either been over-priced for what's on the plate or prepared just under mediocre in quality. I've had burned pizza, under-cooked pizza, tiny portions, and soggy salad. 

At one of their beer event nights, they ran out of glassware and had no resolution or even condolence for the inconvenience or wait. And then, there was no one wait staff assigned to my table and so again, no one took accountability for my experience or my orders. 

On that same night the bartender was extremely rude when I stopped him on his way back to the bar to ask for one simple request (since I didn't know who my server actually was). He told me he was far too busy to assist me and when I asked for management, he shared some choice words with me and then I was approached by a young lady who was equally as rude. Rather than hear my concerns, she immediately defended the actions of the bartender and wanted nothing to do with resolving my issue of getting some service. Then, I was given fake contact information for the owners of the establishment. To this day, I have not been able to connect with owners to discuss my disappointing experiences there. 

Great concept for a restaurant, but a huge disappointment. They get praise for their  beer list and if that's all there was to an establishment experience, I'd have more stars to hand out, but there are just too many other glaring defects that no brew (or even several brews) can fix."}
{"text":"Their food is so so but they serve all kinds of craft beers, have a huge selection of wine, and roast their own coffee beans. Never had a problem with their service."}
{"text":"Recently moved to the west valley and was looking for somewhere with a good draft beer selection, heard from a friend they have a decent selection here. Head on down with the wife and had a great time. So for me I started off with a nice shot of espresso to wake me up on my day off, wife ordered the wine tasting for $6! So she gets two different whites and 2 different reds which were all pretty tasty. It was our first time in and the decor is pretty cool, huge wine rack and about 25 drafts listed on a nice big chalkboard. Tried some nice rare beers like Tripel Karmeliet and a wierd peach IPA. Beers were even served in proper glassware. Server was very friendly and funny as she explained she had just started working there. The music selection was pretty hip and fun. Our food was enjoyable, We tried out a margarita pizza which was nice and handmade in a wood fire oven they have on display. Also tried out there burger which is pretty good and you can tell it is hand packed. We also tried a nice hummus trio out that had a pretty unique pita bread that we enjoyed. Liked the place so much we went back with the inlaws a few weeks later!"}
{"text":"This is our absolutely favorite place in the West Valley for craft beer and amazing food!!  Ian is a connoisseur... \"The Beer Guy!\" If you have a chance go!"}
{"text":"I kept going back to see if the service would improve, but it just never did.  My first visit was with a friend, and we were the only ones in the whole place.  It took 10 minutes for them to acknowledge us, and then 40 minutes to actually get our food, which were just sandwiches and chips, mind you.  Subsequent visits were slightly faster, but always felt like we were troubling them when we needed something.  It's just not worth the frustration, especially with the high prices.  It's too bad they never learned to improve their service or they might be a great spot to eat."}
{"text":"Good service, beer, wine and coffee. Family friendly during the AM and a nice place to meet friends in the PM. Try the gellato too. I have never been disappointed by their food or service."}
{"text":"Went there this morning for breakfast.  We (two of us) sat ourselves and was never approach by a server.  We then got up and went to the front and asked if we need to order at the counter first.  The reply was a curt, \"Yes, before 11, you have to order at the counter.\"

Obviously, if we had known beforehand, we would have done so.....no where is that stated and it was our first time there.

So, the two of us look at the menu board and left.  No one was interested in taking our order or even making eye contact with us.  We left and said \"thank you\".  No one ever said anything back.  

We obviously were not welcome there.   No problem, we went elsewhere and I encourage others to do the same. 

I had heard that service was slow there, but we were just plain IGNORED."}
{"text":"Love supporting this local business. The coffee is great. The food is excellent. And at night it becomes a great place to get beer (craft beer only) or have a glass of wine with some local music in the background. My husband and I love this place and recommend it to all our friends."}
{"text":"I've been to Ground Control a couple of times.  It's been great each time! The gelato/cookie desert is amazing and I've had a couple different sandwiches with their pretzel roll...also amazing!
I've had Ellen as my server and was very impressed with her wine and food suggestions and attention to our needs. 
I will surely go back but will always ask for Ellen as my server!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty cute!

Located in hands down, one of the cutest towns in Arizona, Ground Control is a combined alcohol/coffee/food place. Two very open rooms with booth and tables for the bar area (which wasn't that stocked) and a small little coffee shop. I really like where these folks are going with their idea but they need some serious renovations. The whole establishment kind of reminded me a someone's basement. Bottles behind the bar weren't stacked, just lined up. The coffee shop girl wasn't attentive to her stand and behind the counter looked quite disleveled.

If ground Control spruced up the place, added a bit more hipster (they've got a few good hipster vibes going already) things to do it, then I really think it could attract a fun crowd. Not that they aren't already bringing in the fun people, of course... I mean, I was there."}
{"text":"A few weeks ago we wandered into this unassuming bistro in search of a fancy shmancy coffee for the husband. It was adorable. The staff was very friendly and they made a delicious drink. We noticed that they had a full dining room and menu and promised ourselves that we would return.
So here we are. 
What I noticed first is that this is not intended to be a full service breakfast restaurant. The menu is limited to a few burritos, sandwiches and scrambles. Potatoes figure strongly into the menu so this Paleo girl is struggling to find a way to tweak. I chose a Texas Toast sandwich and enjoyed the bread as a treat.
Husband also got a sandwich and added to it with extra sausage. The food was so so. We will return at another time to try lunch.
In the end, we do not feel that this is a good breakfast spot for those who want more than a baked good and awesome drink. 
But if you are looking for a pick me up and snackage do stop by and enjoy their kind company. They have the best coffee in the Valley."}
{"text":"Decided to check out Ground Control last night based on a reviews on AZ Central as one of the best wine bars.. I totally disagree.  Service was terrible, one person I particular was rude when we interrupted time with his girlfriend.  Had to ask for water, plates, napkins, check, etc.  The wine was decent as well as a couple of appetizers. But pass on the cheese board...  3 small slices for $14. I was looking forward to the European concept but in Europe, they are more helpful and friendly..."}
{"text":"The food here is pretty good as well as the drinks. Everything from the coffee to the selection of wine ans spirits. My only consistent complaint is how clean the place is. I have been here on multiple occasions to find dirty tables, walls, and seats. I wish the staff would do better on keeping the eating area clean. I don't need to see the remains of what the last patron had on my table when I sit down its kind of a turn off."}
{"text":"This was my second time eating here during the lunch hour. Both times I have great food. The angus burger on a pretzel bun and next time the chicken salad. Great stuff. Terrible service!! Never got a refill on my iced tea( which was also really good) Had to get up, go to the bar and ask for a refill. Never got checked on after our food came, and the straws I asked for when our drink came took 15 minutes to get to our table. I looked around and our waiter was nowhere to be found. Later, when we got tired of waiting for our check to come, we got up to the counter to just pay and leave. Overall, the food was good, but the service was just plain bad."}
{"text":"I hate this place so much.  I've always found them very rude and the first location always felt dirty.  The new location was a little cleaner but I won't be back to see how it is now.  The food wasn't very good and is a bit pricey for what you get."}
{"text":"Limited choices, coffee wasn't anything special, and my raspberry scone, while it had good flavor, was burnt and more akin to biscotti."}
{"text":"The service gets worse and worse every time I go.  I might try it one more time but my husband said no way.  Great coffee, good wine and food, terrible service.  When you get told at 10 pm they are closing early on a Saturay night, something is wrong.  They were cleaning up under our feet even though they were supposed to stay open late.  I had to get our own water as no one came back to check on us.  Disappointed as I wanted to really support this local business."}
{"text":"This place has GREAT beer! Unfortunately it's under staffed and could use some updates. The bartender was great but she was clearly weeded the entire time we were there. The other server seemed pretty useless. It was a busy Saturday lunch rush and there was no busser or manager. This place has some serious potential but is in definite need of some guidance. We'll be back specifically for the beer but hopefully it turns around a little so we can try some food."}
{"text":"This full-bar cafe came highly recommended, I found it better than expected. Was then surprised to see less than 4 starts. Mostly because this isn't your average coffee shop. After talking to the server, I discovered it was born out of the owner's love of european bistros. That explains quite a bit. I love the Alice's Restaurant (\"You can get anything you want\") aspect and dig the relaxed atmosphere. For example, the choices include: espresso bar coffee, gelato and pastries in the front; or cruise on back to the wine, beer and a full-service menu section. If you like the efficiency of Strarbucks or fast food establishments you won't like this place. But That's exactly why I like it. You'll also find it more upscale than most coffee shops. Table service is the norm, and you can choose from cushioned bar-height table seating, cushioned regular table seating or white leather booths. Or pull up a stool at the bar in the back (alcohol bar, not coffee bar) and order from a selection of excellent craft beers, or independent wines while you watch the game on the flat-panel t.v.s...  I'm sure I forgot something, but these independent gems need to survive if we're to have true food & drink experience options. I gave it 4 stars due to the full-menu options, overall quality, ambience and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Ok - love this place - I've loved everything on the menu I've had until this morning.  They need to have a better description of their yogurt bowl for breakfast - it should read \"Greek yogurt with 1/2 of a crush granola bar and mandarins oranges\". Very disappointed - frozen berries from Costco and a bag of granola could make this 5 star - this is more like a can and bar camping version...  Won't order again - I'll stick to the breakfast burrito."}
{"text":"I've been to Ground Control for coffee, beer, and food, but would only return for the beer, of which they have a great selection and reasonable prices.

They have a beautiful La Marzocca espresso machine, but their in-house roasted beans taste inferior to many mass-produced brands.

The one time I ordered food it was pathetic:  Pizze margherita that were over-sauced and under-cooked,  buffalo mozzarella tasted off,  no cornichone, no char, and no spotting.  The Phoenix area probably has more awesome neopolitan style pizzerias per-capita that any city in the U.S., but ground control's pizza is barely edible. The poutine and wings were even worse--like what would happen if some some highschool stoner friend was given access to commercial cooking equipment."}
{"text":"I really like this place. The staff are friendly if slow, but overall a good place. I roast my own green coffee beans at home, and the owner sells me beans from his inventory. It's cheaper and better than online ordering considering shipping costs. Food (panini) was very good but slightly overpriced."}
{"text":"My wife and I find ourselves going to Ground Control at least once a week. This restaurant/bar/coffee shop just seems to be getting better and better. The staff here are great. Staff like Ian, Lacie, and Todd are how you can make a good place to go into a great one. Sean has been making consistent changes to Ground Control over the years but has really found the perfect blend of excellent food, due to his executive chef and proper service due to the current crew. P.S. Order a cola-weizen."}
{"text":"1st time here, I had Jasmine green tea and Baja breakfast burrito. It was good. People were nice. Not crowded which is a plus for me. My picture caption is a typo. Burrito had a good amount of egg and sausage with potato. Served with sour cream and pico. Loved it. Services was fine but there was only a couple of other people in there. Hubsand had cabo burrito and loved it! But he had a latte and didn't like that but I did so I drank it. Lol would eat here again."}
{"text":"This is by far the best place to visit in the West Valley for an awesome selection of craft brew.   My wife and I go once or twice a month and the section is always changing which means the beer is always fresh. Food is great too."}
{"text":"We went here for breakfast with some local friends. My wife had the Cabo Burrito and I the 2 egg plate with a short stack.  My inner fat kid loved me.  I somehow ate it all and filled in the gaps with a coffee. None of mine was worth writing home about, but I DID order all the basics.  The pancakes were large, so be prepared for that.

The real highlight here was the Cabo.  A delicious take on the breakfast burrito, the bite I wrangled from my wife's hands left me staring in disappointment at my life choices in front of me.  As I trudged ahead in jealousy, she sang like a Siren the wonders of the Cabo.

The waiter was pretty green but did a good job taking care of us nonetheless. The atmosphere was pleasant and the coffee good."}
{"text":"The first time my fiance and I went with his sister in law for coffee. The coffee was great and it had a cool feel to just sit and chat. My fiance had grown up on the west side and new coffee shops like this weren't easy to find. So we went back thinking it was our best option besides the local Starbucks (we love local coffee shops so this is our last resort). We ordered two lattes and we're incredibly disappointed with what we got. I don't know much about coffee compared to my fiance, whose a barista, but I knew the color was not the right color for a latte and it tasted like watered down coffee with low fat milk (and we did double check that they were vanilla lattes when we picked them up). We were incredibly disappointed with the fact they served us something that was so below par just from the look of it."}
{"text":"Went to Ground Control last night and for my 15 year old daughters birthday.  She said she wanted good pizza and when we found out they also had a Gelato counter we decided to try Ground Control.  We arrived there at around 9 pm on a Friday night and the restaurant was about 3/4 of the way full and we were allowed to choose where we wanted to seat.  I will cover the positives first because they far outweighed the one negative.  Our server Nadine was an amazing server she was helpful and attentive.   We ordered there Brie appetizer and when it came the Brie was very good and the Raspberry sauce served with it was incredibly tasty.  We then picked a pizza that we thought sounded good it was there Beach Bum pizza,  my daughter and I do not like overly spicey food and Nadine told us that it was pretty spicey with the sauce that it was served with.  We asked if we could get a regular tomato sauce on it and she was quick to comply.  When it came it was a very good wood fired pizza with premium toppings on it.  The crust was amazing. On to the Gelato, it is at the front of the restaurant where customers also can order coffee to go.  So, we asked if it is easiest to just go  up there and look at our choices and she told us that would be fine and that there were many.  We decided on a Caramel Pecan and a Rocky Road, both were very tasty.  The caramel one was very creamy with a wonderful buttery flavor with a great caramel finish and lots of nuts.  The Rocky Road tasted as if it was made with a premium chocolate and was also very good.  Between Nadine's excellent service and the great food one would think that this should be a 5 star review and it almost was.  But when we went to the Gelato bar and wanted to order their was a front of house person who seemed to be there for the Gelato and to make coffee drinks but she had turned out the light on Gelato case and was more interested  in talking to a friend then helping us.  I asked her to turn on the light in the case and we picked the one's she wanted but she could not be pulled away from her friend who was standing there drinking a coffee that he ordered from her as we got there.  She sent us back to our table and told us to get our server to get it for us.  I did not catch her name but she had pink hair (which I have no problem with)  The only other small complaint that would not have kept me from giving it a five star rating was that the online menu on their web page had not been updated and one of the pizza's we were looking at they no longer served and most items were a dollar more.  I certainly plan to go back and if the lady with pink hair is not there or has decided she is there for customers and not friends I am sure I will be able to give it a five star review.  Still highly recommend this place for great pizza in the west valley and much more"}
{"text":"FIRST -- As I browse the reviews I can't help but wonder why this place has not done something about the awful, horrible, ridiculously lousy service? 

The food and coffee are decent and the atmosphere, albeit a bit cluttered, is nice -- good for conversation or for work. But for the love of God, WHAT are you trying to be? A coffee house? A wine bar? Beer connoisseurs? Pick something and be really, really good at it because this place has bits and pieces of being good, but doesn't have it all together.

Again, back to service because for me that is just such a huge part of dining out. I simply cannot get over how horrible it was -- probably the worst I've ever had. There is no pinnacle of food greatness that could ever be reached that would make me overlook rude wait staff."}
{"text":"First time at restaurant. Bohemian laid back style chic place to nosh on salads. Wine, and coffee specialty drinks . I enjoyed my Astoria salad ingredients were fresh. Lettuce made it difficult to eat. Spring mix could have been colder became warm and wilted. Server was attentive in beginning but as the crowd appeared not as attentive. Overall enjoyed my visit will try with friends and do some wine flights."}
{"text":"My husband and I have never been here until today. We stopped in for coffee and breakfast. The coffee was amazing, very smooth and flavorful! The breakfast burrito was also very good. We will be coming back for sure!"}
{"text":"When I visit the Phoenix area I always stop in here for a chai late with almond milk. A friend hooked me and I haven't had such a delicious one anywhere else...it is such a treat! The staff is friendly and very accommodating. 

I have had breakfast here a few times and the food is flavorful. 

Note: If you like your eggs plain to season yourself, you should ask for them that way."}
{"text":"Whats not to LOVE about this place on the West Side?  28 or so ALL CRAFT BEERS On Tap. Gourmet Espresso to DIE for and Service from Resident Beer Expert Ian Harwell.  Almost forgot, the Whiskey & Scotch selection here is INSANE!  Really Insane!  I have never seen a bigger or better selection in my life.   
Head out to the West Side and go to Caballero, Ground Control and Peoria Artisan Brewery & make a day of it!  Great Day Trip!"}
{"text":"A great place to dine, very intimate with great servers! The seating is perfect, good spacing between tables. Servings are great proportions, you'll definitely will get the best for your dollar. 

Perhaps, some trio music, could enhance the nights on Saturdays, since the holiday season has arrive."}
{"text":"The only good thing about this place is the beer selection.  The panini that was supposed to be one of their best was terrible.  The service wasn't great and the whole restaurant just seemed cluttered and thrown together."}
{"text":"Beer tasting was an excellent event! Our whole group had a good time and we will return for the next!"}
{"text":"The food was nothing to write home about but the beer choices were good. Service was ok, could be better. Waitress seemed rushed. She may have been the only server but it wasn't busy..."}
{"text":"Not my favorite iced coffee but cool set up in an area of town that it's hard to find these kind of vibes. Will give it another try."}
{"text":"The first time I went to Ground Control, the service wasn't the best, the baristas (sp) weren't very welcoming and the breakfast food wasn't very good either. I decided to give it another chance, and l have no future plans to go back. Stay far away from the chicken salad as we found an unwelcome visitor mixed in with ours. So unless you like to eat bug sandwiches I'd steer clear from this place."}
{"text":"Friday January 30, during one of my several visits to Ground Control, we attempted to use our 2015 Entertainment Book coupon (BOGO up to $15 value).  We presented our coupon upon receipt of our bill (The HOG $13; Salmon $19) to our server. Our server advised that the coupon should have been presented when we ordered. She went on to explain Salmon & Steak entrees were exempt from the coupon, therefore she could not accept it. Thus we had to pay full price for the second non premium  meal. We questioned her stating the second meal was less and we would still be paying full price for the salmon. She said it didn't matter, owner's policy was to not accept the coupon if any party ordered the salmon or steak.  We understand that rationale should both of us ordered premium meals the coupon could not be used. The owner's policy, as stated by our server, is contrary to the wording on the coupon nor is it noted on the menu or visibly posted in the restaurant.

Friday's experience is in direct conflict from my visit, with several friends, to Ground Control in December 2014.  During that dinning experience we used the Entertainment Book coupon from the 2014 book.  We presented the coupon to our server, prior to ordering, and was not told of ANY menu exemptions.

I'm writing this review to express my frustration with what appears to be an inconsistent application of Ground Control's coupon policy.  We enjoy patronizing this restaurant and have always had good food and service; however, Friday nights experience left us disappointed in Ground Control's customer service and public relations."}
{"text":"Food is decent,  staff is friendly.  Slow service and over priced with a limited menu."}
{"text":"The restaurant was suggested to me by a friend.  I should have looked at the reviews before going. The beer list was good and we asked the waitress for suggestions.  The Artichoke dip she suggested was fair at best.  We ordered 2 pizzas and a cheese board. 1 pizza arrived and we waited for the other 2 dishes.  They never arrived. When we could finally get the ONLY waitresses attention she apologized and stated she would re order the pizza and was put off when we cancelled the cheese plate.  I asked to talk to the manager and someone lese arrived and listed to my complaint but stated he was not the manager and he had no authority to do anything about the mixup. He was quite curt about it.  I travel for a living and know what to expect in a restaurant.  THIS WAS FAR FOM ENJOYABLE.  WE WONT BE BACK AND I SUGGEST IF YOU ARE REDING THIS YOU NOT EVEN TRY IT."}
{"text":"Whereas my rating would have been much higher should I have reviewed this after my first visit; however with repeat visits my experience has been less than stellar.

I will start by saying the specialty coffee drinks are excellent, only if created by the main Barista - Steve.  He is highly skilled in his craft, only to be pulled down by the sub par help who backs him up.  Every experience with employees other than Steve has been dismal, and this review serves as a wake-up call to the management staff to better train their employees on service and skill.

Of the many negative points I can make about the staff, my last experience left me questioning if I should ever return.  While not in the mood for a specialty drink, I decided to order the French Press coffee which is highlighted as a menu item.  After I purchased my coffee, I found a mug of drip coffee sitting on the bar.  Assuming it was for someone else, I continued to wait for my French Press.  Several minutes went by, and I inquired as to where my drink was, to which I was simply pointed to the cup sitting on the bar.  I stated what was there was not French Press coffee, and in response I was told that their drip coffee IS French Press.  Color me confused, but what was sitting on the bar was not what I had ordered, nor what I had paid a premium for.

Unfortunately, banter back and forth with the staff led me nowhere but sitting at a table with my stale drip coffee, now only luke warm from sitting too long.  Only able to tolerate a few sips, I left the mostly full cup of stale diner coffee questioning if I would ever return.

Since then, there have been several occasions where I contemplated going back; however I have yet to convince myself of the benefit.  

Unfortunately this hidden gem of a coffee house has been tarnished by the service and lack of experience.  Hopefully with time the talent will improve and better decisions will be made as to how to keep customers coming back."}
{"text":"My favorite Gastropub! A great selection of craft beer...no crap here! A must go to place!"}
{"text":"Id give them 4 stars for coffee, it is tasty.  I will try again.  I didn't try anything else so no rating for food, atmosphere etc."}
{"text":"Wow-
Happy hour deal on a Friday evening! 
Todd, the bartender came by our table, so I asked what specialty drink he could whip up. \"The Old Fashioned\", he said would do it.
 So I let him hand-muddle cherries and such in ice. The best I have ever had. Thanks Bartender! 
This place knows their stuff around the hops and can hand-muddle others to perfection.
We ordered the artichoke and spinach dip which is a little pricy but discounted for happy hour. What a nice treat- hot toasted baguette with bubbling hot dip. Nice, but so much dip, place another order of toasted baguette. 
Great happy hour deal."}
{"text":"We met friends there for lunch. All our first time.. it took 1 hour to get our food..they refilled out tea with room temp tea ..we had to ask for ice.one of items came to the table and the cheese  was black completely  burned.. they said they would make another one but to start eating what we could from under the burned stuff. It took 20 min to make a new meal. By that time all the rest of us were done eating. So it was put a to go box. About 5 min after out food was delivered the waitress said we needed to pay cause she was going home and needed her tip money. So we stopped eating and paid her. Our French fries were undercooked and cold. There was so much sauce on one sandwich that it was impossible to eat all of it. When we got ready to leave about a half hour after we paid we noticed the waitress was still there.will never go back there to eat. Prices a little high for what little good we got"}
{"text":"I'm brand-spankin new to Arizona, and one minute in this desert heat had me CRAVING some cold, creamy gelato. I was prepared to look high and low to find some of the good stuff, and was even prepared to drive oh-so-far away to Phoenix from Goodyear, but to my surprise, I came across Ground Control! 

I walked into this establishment and was really excited to see a non-chain coffee/food/gelato establishment out here in suburbia. It looked and felt like a shop right out of Portland! I was a little confused about where to order, but was told to take a look at a menu at the counter, order there, and then have a seat. Easy enough. 

They have a MASSIVE menu for a small shop, and I was tempted by many items but decided on a crabcake pretzel sandwich. Yum, right? Unfortunately, it took a full 40 minutes to prepare and be served to me, and I was short on time, which was a bit stressful. The sandwich was pretty yummy, a bit cold (hmmmm), but decent enough. I wanted to try their gelato but didn't have time. ;( I did, however, order a glass of white wine, which they did not have cold, so they offered me another type of wine at the same price that was already chilled. I appreciated that service. 

The biggest thing that I noticed here was the lack of customer service -- this place has TONS of potential and good enough food, but the employees were just sort of sitting around and seemed to be more focused on laughing together and having a good time than serving their customers. I'll definitely be back, mostly because I'm all about supporting the small businesses AND I am dying to try some of that gelato -- and hopefully the service will be stellar this next time around."}
{"text":"A friend and I had breakfast here and, unfortunately, both the food and the service we're marginal, borderline terrible. Our waiter, Mike, forgot multiple things about my order, took a super long time to refill my coffee, and didn't really seem that interested in good service. He kept apologizing after the fact for missing things and taking too long. 

Additionally, the hashbrowns were cold and chewy and my friends salad dressing tasted like it came from a can. The place was also out of many of the things on the menu and they didn't seem to  care very much or be well organized. It kind of felt like the staff were there more for themselves than making the customers a priority.  

Lastly, there were multiple other people around us who were also looking unhelped and they seemed frustrated that no one was making them a priority. After leaving we spoke to a man, who left at the same time, about the service and he also complained that it was very slow (even though there were few people there). 

I would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"Food is good but service is terrible! The fourth and final time was the worst. It was a Saturday night and the \"live entertainment\" was a local voice school performing a recital with many young children. Needless to say it was terrible and very loud. When our food trickled out, it was good but everything came one at a time 10 minutes apart. Our server never really apologized, and made it sound like it was our fault for coming on a busy night. Most of the patrons were parents of the children singing that night."}
{"text":"Poor customer service. Mediocre coffee probably because of poor customer service."}
{"text":"Pretty awesome place indeed! Great fresh brewed coffee and delicious food. Try the Santorini and a breakfast burrito!"}
{"text":"Tonight, my friend and I were looking to grab some late-night coffee and she happened to find this little place hidden in Goodyear that just happened to be open until 12.

When we arrived, I was very impressed by their wine and beer selection. I thought this would be an excellent place to go with friends on a weekend to sit and catch up or do a wine tasting. Considering Ground Control is so far on the West Side... this type of thing is almost unheard of. It's very nice to know that it exists.

 My friend and I proceeded to order our drinks after having a look over the menu. She ordered a frozen toffee coffee drink, and I ordered their Chai, iced.  As we were waiting, i started noticing just how much time had passed. In the time we waited for our drinks, the band had played 2 complete songs.  

Once our drinks were ready, the man behind the counter was quite rude when he informed us that our drinks were sitting on the opposite side of the counter from where we were standing. I was very excited to try my drink, and after doing so. I couldn't believe what I had just tasted. It was unlike anything I've ever experienced with the word \"Chai\" in the title. It was grainy (like sand), sour, tangy, sweet, and easily the most bizarre thing I have ever tried. I was very disappointed and considered returning it for something else.

I refrained from returning it, but I definitely did not finish it. 
Working in a restaurant, I know the stress that comes from receiving direct complaints. 

Safe to say, I probably won't be back for coffee anytime soon."}
{"text":"Liking the place, came here for a first time and so far it looks like a good place to hang out. They play live music! Although, I didn't try the food they do have good beers :)"}
{"text":"Great set up 
Great service
Definitely will be going back to try their beers
(No crap on tap)
They have a big chalk board when there will be live music,  upcoming events ect."}
{"text":"Great beer, great pizza, and great service. Ian,\"The Beer Guy\" Harwell has done a masterful job of bringing awesome craft beer to the West Valley. I love Ground Control!"}
{"text":"Ground Control is my go-to craft beer spot on the West side. With roughly 30 beers on tap and new ones being added every Wednesday, it gives reason to keep coming back. They have a great relationship with the local breweries. For their recent ten year anniversary, 6 of the 28 beers on draft were created just for their event by local breweries. The atmosphere is small and inviting, which is perfect for a date or to just grab drinks with friends. Food is decent, typical gastro pub kinda food though, not a huge selection. The honey hot wings are my favorite. On Friday nights, they have some live music, but the few times I've been on a Friday evening, I felt the sound system was too loud, so I don't usually go on Friday's."}
{"text":"Stopped on our way through. Good service, good food, cool vibe. Get the brussels, extra goat cheese, then a yummy brick-fired pizza, and a beer. Grab a coffee (or latte!) on your way out."}
{"text":"Have been here several times and enjoy their rotating tap list, often times they are missing some beers (not all 20 are being used) but the variety makes up for it and there is always some new that I try and love. 

Their breakfast is the main reason for losing one star, it was bland and not good. I got the breakfast burrito and the tortilla was like a cracker, too thick and almost had a bread texture. The eggs, and everything in the burrito had no flavor, so I had to cover it in salsa and hot sauce. My boyfriend picked out a different egg dish, can't remember what, which should be evidence that it also was not memorable. 

Their lunch/dinner options have been much, much better. I love the pizza- especially the BBQ pork pizza. The salads are fresh and crisp, and the have lists of choices that we haven't tried yet. 

I've only seen this place full once or twice, but when we are looking for a comfortable place to grab a beer or do a flight tasting this is our number one choice in the area because of how many didn't types of beers they have to offer."}
{"text":"Although this restaurant is the opposite of visually appealing, with wiring hanging from the celling, and the floor and celling are seemingly not finished, this restaurant has decent food, so I have given this restaurant a generous tree stars."}
{"text":"Fairly good. Spouse and I both had salads. His Greek salad had easily an entire can of olives on it...can you say overkill with iceberg lettuce. Decent wine and beer choices, I had a Riesling flight of three, server wasn't sure which was which though so that was pointless. Service is good, better than average. Their gelato is seriously overpriced for the lack of flavor. Still, it's a nice little taste of Europe when you get to missing it."}
{"text":"Seriously, sat here for 30 minutes and the server never one time came by the table, but helped the table next to us. My wife went up to ask if we were seated possibly seated in a wrong area. The guy started telling her and stopped and said he had to get the phone. We left. I will never come back to this place again. You guys have really gone downhill."}
{"text":"I've been coming to GC since they opened. At first it was a great little hole-in-the-wall place but over the years it's morphed and become something equally if not more enjoyable. The food, drinks, and gelato are all tasty... I've yet to try something that I don't like. That being said, their price point on some menu items is a little high but it's usually worth it for the pleasant atmosphere alone. 

They've moved since the last time I was able to go in but I can't wait to visit them at their new location and have my very, very favorite drink again (an iced \"Sherpa\"!) although I wouldn't say no to sampling one of their newer drinks (\"Huckleberry Lemonade\" I believe?) again.

My only serious complaint is that service can be a little slow, even when they're not particularly crowded. I hate servers that hover but sometimes I've been left waiting for an eternity to receive my bill."}
{"text":"We come here frequently but I seem to always get the same thing. The angus burger with the pretzel bun is so yummy and a hearty portion. The fries are \"ok\" (usually soggy and under done) so i usually opt for the side salad with house dressing instead. The brick oven pizzas are yummy IF they have been cooked long enough and there isn't too much cheese, which can make it soggy. They have delicious authentic gelato which is a rare find! The staff is hit or miss. Usually a little slower than expected but we don't seem to be in a hurry so we are fine."}
{"text":"The food here is really good!! I've try the panini and for desert I've try theirs gelato. Really good!!! Great service.!!!"}
{"text":"I'm going to echo Gabe L's review by saying that the food and atmosphere was good but the service was quite bad...even as there were very few patrons in the restaurant on a Sunday evening. 

It's funny, I arrive at my brother's house and he says we're coming here for dinner and I mentioned how I bookmarked this place to try for morning coffee...let's just say I didn't come back for coffee due to my first impression. 

We sat ourselves down at a table and waited several minutes to receive a menu. Our waiter was kind of abrasive and not very personable to say the least. We ordered up a few beers and one of their cheese platters, which was really good. I ordered up a Pretzel Roll Roast Beef Sandwich and side salad which was really good as well. We ended our meal with some of their caramel flavored gelato which was super creamy and amazingly light. 

According to my brother and his wife, the service is usually much more together and we were visited by the waiter from their last visit...a much more happy and personable guy. Usually I can overlook bad service when the food is good but it seemed like our business wasn't really appreciated on this visit (although the other waiter was super friendly and happy to hear I was from out of town). At least I would have expected some kind of \"sorry for the slow service\" apology but it never came. When I visit again, i might return to attempt another go at either dinner or at least coffee. But until then, I can't give this place my blessing...even if the food is above par."}
{"text":"We come here once a year. It takes that long to forget the service is horrible.  It really needs a good manager to staff the place with good waiters. The food is good if you don't mind being ignored and waiting forever, and no it was not busy on any of the times we've been here.  I used to drop by in the morning for coffee to go but I had to stop because  most of the time they don't open on time.  I'm sure its a great place if you just want to drink for a few hours and get food while you're at it."}
{"text":"I've only gotten the toffee frap the few times I've gone, but it is daaaamn good. Try it out!"}
{"text":"I cannot believe that such a great place can spiral to such a bad thing.  I have been coming here for years.  They were at a different location and it seems like their new spot just hasn't had the same appeal. 

In the West Valley it is near impossible to find a spot with good beers and wines and this place has so much to be desired because they have the beer and wines, but the horrible service and food just leaves you disappointed. 

The staff just have no attention to the customers and at times they are understaffed.  I understand the constraints of staff but maybe a different approach to leadership can help this place because the clientele is still coming in but even talking with people I know, everyone agrees the service is just bad."}
{"text":"This place is one of the best coffee shops there is! They are friendly, and locally owned.  They even roast their own coffee!  

They are not the fastest when it comes to making your coffee and food, but that is a good thing.  They make quality products.  If you want something that is made fast and tastes like burnt popcorn, you can always go to Starbucks.  People have to understand that this is a locally owned restaurant, and more often than not the owner is also the barista, chef, and bartender. 

I have never had a poorly made drink, I have never had to deal with a employee treating me like an idiot, and I don't have to speak in code when I want a personalized order.  (i.e. A  zebra, wet, no whip mocha.  Really?!) 

Great coffee, good food, craft beer and fine wine. How can you go wrong with that combination?

Also, they serve paleo dishes if you are into that sort of thing."}
{"text":"Gave this place three chances. I'm a military guy out at Luke AFB, and know this place is owned by a pilot out there.  Thank you for your service, but come on your small business needs some major work in the area of customer service.  Each time I've visited Ground Control the customer service was completely absent. The workers here are unhappy (never greet you, never smile... please if you don't like your job go somewhere else).  The first time I visited my wife and I were sitting down, and noticed a couple walk in and take a seat.  They sat for over ten minutes and no one greeted them, so they left. The second time I visited was with my daughter.  We ordered our food, were served, and weren't waited on at our table for over 20 minutes thereafter.  The third time was today (Mar 23, 2013).  I walked up to the front counter and stood there for over three minutes (zero service).  I walked to the back counter and was asked if I wanted something.  I told the woman I'd like to sit down to study, and she pointed me to two tables that had a power outlet.  I told her I would like a menu.  Fifteen minutes passed without service, so I walked up to the back counter again.  Two more minutes.  Got my laptop and said the hell with it.  I'm typing now from Starbucks.  My advice, stay away from Ground Control.  Had high hopes for this place but three strikes you're out!"}
{"text":"Incredible coffee, great beer selection, delicious food, cozy atmosphere, and friendly staff. The food is a little pricey for the amount you receive, and there is normally a long wait for food, but I believe it's worth it.

The restaurant section gets 4 stars, but the coffee bar gets 5+ stars for impeccable EVERYTHING!"}
{"text":"Very good selection. Food was good, pizza. Service for lunch was sparse. A nice little place for a bite and coffee was fresh and tasty."}
{"text":"Coffee: 2 stars
Food and beer selection: 4 stars

Coffee: 2.0 stars
Espresso was bitter and stale, as was their drip. Clearly using old, overroasted coffee and perhaps not great water. Again, hugely disappointing, because this wasn't always the case.

Food and beer selection: 4.0 stars
Their food and beer selection are saving their reputation almost singlehandedly. I enjoy their sandwiches, and they have all sorts of great beers on tap. 

As a coffee lover, this is honestly a hard review to write--West Valley has a practically nonexistent specialty coffee scene (I have yet to find a shop that even comes close to threatening to compete with halfway decent shops in Central Phoenix), and for a while Ground Control was the sole shop within all of west Phoenix with respectable coffee. But sadly, based on three returns, each worse than the last, their coffee quality has dramatically deteriorated, and if they remain at the top of the West Valley coffee list, it's only because they operate in a vacuum of quality.

Their food at least partially redeems them, to be fair. But with a name like Ground Control and a history of decent coffee, it's sad to see it in this current state."}
{"text":"So I've Been here several times. I love the selection of wines and the micro brews. The food isn't half bad either. I had the garlic fries as an appetizer and the carnitas tacos for lunch and I was pleasantly surprised. The tacos were super yummy. I love Mexican food so I'm always skeptical ordering Mexican food from a non Mexican restaurant. The meat was on point and the mango salsa was good too. I will say I think they should crank up the heat on their green salsa. But I love spicy and I know not everyone does. But maybe just a little spice at least. My biggest complaint ( and I've noticed it being the same every time i visit) is that it's HOT in this joint. Like I know it cost money to run an AC but come on. You're serving the public. And it wasn't just me that thought it was hot either. No one wants to sit at a restaurant where it's scorching hot. It's uncomfortable. I kid you not it was cooler outside when we left than it was inside. And that is never supposed to happen in AZ UNLESS it's December or January , maybe even Feb. time to turn on the old AC!"}
{"text":"I am reviewing their coffee service only at the Litchfield location. They roast the beans in house and are some of the best I have ever had for espresso. They have the very best Espresso machine and grinder that money can buy and I have never had a less than excellent shot of espresso. I have an Izzo Espresso machine and a Mazzer mini grinder at home so I buy a lot of coffee beans here. They do not seal the bags, they just roll them up and use metal tabs to keep them closed. They do not mark the roast date on the bags so it is a guess as far as freshness. The guy who does the roasting gives 5-star service and he is very knowledgeable. Problem is that I usually get one of the 22 year old \"deer in the headlights when asked a question\" waitresses when I buy coffee. Their web site just plain sucks, it does not have their addresses for the locations listed! There is some annoying music that restarts every time you go to a different page."}
{"text":"Food, service, and atmosphere are all excellent! The wood fired pizzas are amazing. I also tried the Tacos de Calle which were pulled pork with mango and pita chips with tomatillo salsa. Save room for some of their in house roasted coffee and homemade gelato! Molto bene! A must try if you're in the area! A true gem in the west valley!

Third time here and needed to lower my 5 star to 4 stars du to a ridiculous wait which in my opinion was unnecessary... They had a reserved table for 2 hours siting empty while we waited over an hour to get seated!"}
{"text":"I went here not to long ago and ended up having a great night. I know there are a lot of bad reviews but the service was good and the drinks, food and atmosphere made it a overall awesome night!"}
{"text":"Tried this place again. Came for breakfast. Potatoes were call southwestern but were really spicy! Our server was new and had no idea what he was doing. He was nice, but clueless. Friend ordered sugar free chai tea and it had CHUNKS of the chai powder mix still in it. Sent it back, asked for regular tea, never got it. Breakfast deal was $6 - good price but terrible service."}
{"text":"5 stars!  

-Great Food
-Great Service
-Great Quality
-Unique variety of drinks & food
-Relaxed atmosphere & reasonably priced

This is a neat spot with lots going on!!  We have visited before for the coffee and gelato (which never disappoint) and decided we wanted to try the food.  We went to the dining area and ordered the Beach Bum pizza, kids pizza, and the large NOSH platter.  Everything was delish!  They had a wine tasting going on that day and I decided to partake (was only $8 for 4 samples that were at least half glass full each!).  Our service was incredible and the fact that a military family owns this business makes paying that much easier!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place has an amazing craft beer selection to choose from and also sells great coffee. The breakfast options are descent as well.  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I have to say that Ground Control is one of the Valley's true gems for craft beverage lovers. The beer guy, Ian, is passionate and friendly. He knows the industry and he's always willing to go above and beyond for his customers. He's built a tremendous following with his great beer list. He's also done remarkably well building a really nice whiskey selection. The food is good and they also have a really good coffee shop/bar in the front. If you are in the west valley and you are looking for a great place to eat and drink...Ground Control is the place for you. If you luck out and Ian is working, you're in for a treat."}
{"text":"This is my go- to local coffee place!!! The food is pretty boring so I wouldn't recommend anything other than pizza or their home made muffins.  We do eat breakfast there occasionally but I'm never impressed.

I have to give 4 stars for the people though!! If you go more than a few times they treat you royally!"}
{"text":"Let me start off with the highlights: the food was decent and they do have a pretty extensive beer list.

Giant con: I went for the first time with my husband and we were generally satisfied with the evening, we did have to move our table because we were elbow to elbow at the high tops and couldn't talk but they seemed happy to move us and accommodate. We ordered a couple beers and when the bill came the server tried to slip in the most expensive beer on the menu (10$) that we never ordered! How shady! Left a bad taste in my mouth."}
{"text":"I was really excited to finally find this kind of kitchy place on the \"west side\".  I was even more excited when I got there and there was beer and wine from Oregon and other countries.  With that being said, I was not impressed with the service.  We practically had to beg for another glass of wine and the server was too busy flirting with the girls who came in to get coffee than to check in on us.  I thought I had finally found a spot to hang with my friends but I would rather drink a bottle of wine in the backyard; at least I will get a refill when I need one!"}
{"text":"I forgot to mention , last Sunday... All the tables were dirty and there was an elderly couple that wanted a table , my 11 yr old son cleaned off a table for then as well ! Really? Give me a break! Hire more staff already!"}
{"text":"This is a neat little place. Pretty unique for the area. I ended up getting the Pub Chicken and my wife got the porkster. I personally think the food is a overprice for the quality and portion. The porkster was tiny and you could barely see the meat in between, from the side all you see is the bun. The Pub Chicken was pretty good. At the end of the day, I probably wouldn't come back cause its pretty expensive."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times. I have always been annoyed about the wait times for just a drink. Yet the coffee toffee always tastes good enough to keep me coming back. Most recent visit was a couple days ago. Very unimpressed. I ordered a bagel with cream cheese and my usual coffee toffee. My boyfriend decided to try one of the barista's recommendations, a cafe sisu. We waited about 20+ minutes for our drinks and my bagel. And the place was empty so I was very confused about why it was taking so long. Finally got my bagel. Immediately was displeased by how much cream cheese was put on it. I scraped the excess off, it literally looked like someone took a soup ladle full of cream cheese and flopped it on my bagel. Then we got the drinks. The coffee toffee did not taste right and it was not blended enough. There were huge chunks of ice through-out. We asked the barista to blend it up some more and he acted annoyed but did it anyways. Wow, so sorry to inconvenience you. And as for the cafe sisu, it tasted like bad chocolate milk. It was so gross. We ended up throwing it away because we did not want to deal with the moody barista. I will not be returning to this place. Service was bad and wait time was ridiculous. Go to Starbucks."}
{"text":"Have been coming to Ground Control since the old location. My wife's hankering is the Parmesan Garlic Fries. That's what we drove for from Laveen. Unfortunately we had a bad experience today. The soda didn't have any carbonation. We asked our server if he could check it out. He did and said there was a carbonation problem and he called Coca Cola for a repairman. He gave us a Iced tea and lemonade. Should have had a beer. They have a great selection of drafts and bottles. Go for the drafts. The sandwiches came and the parm garlic fries were terrible. Since it was after 2:30 pm, the fries were probably leftovers which were re-dropped into deep fryer to bring back to temp. Hard as rocks and were the bottom of barrel small little pieces. Disappointed. I asked server to replace them which he did, but to be a great restaurant you dont skimp or take shortcuts especially when there are more kitchen employees then customers. The sandwiches were good but, fries are to be eaten with sandwich, not after sandwich.
The Artichoke appetizer was awesome.
I just hope that todays bad experience isnt something that becomes an ongoing occurrence."}
{"text":"Went here a couple weeks ago to watch a friend play. I must say I was pretty impressed. Good atmosphere and the beers they had were great! I shall be back."}
{"text":"Decent service. Not super friendly. Coffee was pretty good, not amazing by any means. It's a comfortable place to meet with friends and chat. Good atmosphere."}
{"text":"Crying shame, it is, when a place that I've been touting to family and friends for as long as I can remember falls off a cliff.  While they still have a fantastic selection of craft brews, customer service has clearly, and RAPIDLY, fallen to the bottom of their list.  
Twice in two weeks my wife and I have stopped in, hoping/expecting to get served in a professional manner, only to find ourselves compelled to leave, extremely disappointed.  
Last week, while staring at several open tables, we were told that, \"it will be 20-30 minutes while our servers catch up.\"  Then, just now, we tried again.  We got seated right away.  After waiting patiently for 10 minutes, I verbally snagged a server who was doing his level best to ignore us and told him I sure would appreciate it if our server would maybe stop by.  
Some dude comes to our table and makes it clear that he's doing us a favor by filling in because they are, \"so busy.\"  We left.  He made it abundantly clear that he could give a shit. 
Seems unlikely we'll be back anytime soon.  
Sucks!  I used to like this place.  Too bad their management clearly has their head squarely up their ass."}
{"text":"Went out here for the first time the other night and besides the tables being a little too close it was a great time. No crap on tap for sure!!!"}
{"text":"Came in and was seated. Waited 30 min then server said it was her second day on the job. Waited another 45 min to get a cheese platter but the Robert hall wine was excellent. The food was great. But the timing if it all was poor and ruined our experience."}
{"text":"Their pizza is AMAZING. Super fresh ingredients, really really good. I also love their salad and balsamic dressing. Very unique sandwich choices, it's a must try."}
{"text":"They have a really original coffee flavors and not bad priced either. Cafe Vienna is pretty bomb. Along with some good food.. The service is a little lacking but other than that not a bad place to chill."}
{"text":"Overpriced and not much worth returning for. I have to agree that the service is terrible. The beer is AMAZING and that's probably where their profits come from because the menu is severely lacking. It's on par with sports bar food. Too bad because they could totally have the gastro pub vibe going if only they'd invest in a respectable menu and employees who care. Check out some popular spots around town for ideas or invest in a restaurant consultant and you could have a gold mine out here!"}
{"text":"I have been going to Ground Control since it opened, this is the place that serves great wine, beer and coffee in the far west valley. I recently went to the new location and was hoping it was going to be more organized then previous location. The customer service has always been lacking but this time it was sad for me. The staff didn't know the menu and the front of the store was a mess. There was a feel of lack of ownership.
 
I asked if I could be seated because the lady who was at the front made us feel like she was pushing us out  it wasn't even 8:00? I ordered a specialty coffee and to my surprise was served in a to go cup. If you are seated you would think it would come in a coffee cup that's why I go there. I did look at the new menu and it looked really good, lots of great new dishes.

I really want this place to be successful it has so much potential and I am going to continue going there. Review after review bad customer service lack of knowledge from staff. But has great food and coffee great vibe!  It's lacking in leadership and I can't wait to see this place shine."}
{"text":"We had breakfast which I got disorder coffee - black & white chocolate yum. Awesome cabo breakfast burritto with avocado eggs  cheese bacon & potato plus it's huge I'm taking the 2nd half home for breakfast tomorrow. My friends says the banana nut muffin was really good!"}
{"text":"I have no idea how good their food is but their coffee is disgusting. The only reason I gave this place two stars because I've been there in the past and the coffee was really solid but since June the quality has gone down. They were using a gas station quality espresso machine and the drinks were of similar quality. I usually will be able to choke down a drink but Ground Control was the exception. Never going back."}
{"text":"I drove up and already liked the place- \"Coffee, wine, and gelato.\" YES! My kind of place. I walk in and the coffee bar and gelato is right in front of your face. It's cool because they roast the beans there and there are buckets of freshly roasted beans to the left. Awesome! On the right, there are a bunch of bottles of wine. Yummy yum yum!

I checked the rest of the place out. Cleanliness and attractiveness was a little lacking (including restaurant area and bathroom.)

The barista girl gave me samples of whatever gelato I wanted. Then, I couldn't decide what I wanted- iced chai or cinnamon gelato. She then did something brilliant- she mixed them and made me a smoothie/shake! Sweeeeeeeeeeeeeet! That's exactly it. Sweet. Rich. It was pretty good but too rich that I couldn't finish the small. Lol my friend ordered a CAFÉ CUBANO which has sweetened condensed milk & raw sugar. He ordered it iced. He got it hot. Bummer. But, he said it tasted good. He just said that the last few sips were extremely sweet because all of the stuff was at the bottom.

Overall, I loved the staff and the options. I think they should remodel the place and clean up a little bit so that it would be more appealing. This place has a lot of potential."}
{"text":"I'm so disappointed! Saturday night at 9:30pm and NO coffee?  This place is called GROUND control right? Bad live music and beer is all that you can get tonight. No thanks. Be sure to call BEFORE you drive!"}
{"text":"Second time at this restaurant.  I first visited on a Groupon.  I am not easily impressed (25 years in the restaurant biz) but this is a small in size and giant in stature establishment did the trick.  Great coffee drinks, Gelato, good wine menu, full bar and a menu (unlike the copycats for most places) someone put some thought into.  I told my wife we had to go to this place.  She was not so excited but knew if I was raving about it she needed to check it out.  Sean the owner was very helpful with all our wine questions and seems extremely knowledgeable.  If you have not been to this hidden gem I suggest you give it a try on your next outing.  Wish we had more places like this to enjoy on the SW side of the valley.  In the end wife said \"I could come here all the time\"!  We will be back to Ground Control!!"}
{"text":"Don't know what happened here but on a recent trip to Phoenix I met up with a family member here because it was conveniently located between us and recommended to me. We went for breakfast on a Sunday morning.

The food - once we got it - was actually really good. I had a bagel with eggs and spinach and vegetables, my boyfriend had a breakfast burrito. However, they were out of everything I asked for. The server made three trips back to tell me every time, with about ten minutes in between trips. It took half an hour just to get some tea even though the place was almost empty. Our server blamed the issues on the kitchen and said he was normally a bartender and had no clue what was going on. Way to go, guy. If you're local, avoid this place."}
{"text":"Be sure to have an 892.11N wifi card on your device or you won't be able to connect here... For some reason that's all they have enabled on their guest  router.  The coffee is not super outstanding, but a bit better than Wendy's or McDonalds.  

They said all their coffee is brewed in a French Press.  They serve it from an \"airpot\" pump dispenser, so there is no way of knowing how long it has been in the pot.  Unfortunately, a pour-over brew is not available. 

The dining area is huge, with only a few tables by power outlets. 

I didn't have any food, so I can't speak to that :)"}
{"text":"This place has so much potential. Every time I have been in the food is hit or miss and the servers act like they are doing you a favor. The coffee isn't worth dealing with the workers and same goes for the food."}
{"text":"Wood-fired oven makes a fantastic meal. We received our menus in 5 minutes. Server checked on us twice before we made our final choices. We tried to order the cheese plate, but our server told us that it might be a Tuesday night thing with their wine-tasting event.

While waiting, it was great seeing one of the chefS use the wood-fired oven for more than just pizza. I saw a variety of dishes go in and out. One of those dishes was our delicious baked brie with raspberry jam. Although it was served with lavash or crisp flat bread and apples, we enjoyed it with our pizza crust, leftover pretzel bun, tortilla chips. Our Angus burger was beautiful, this was a Yelp recommendation. The pretzel bun was robust and hearty. We liked our upgraded garlic Parmesan fries but there wasn't enough of it. Next time, we will purchase another order of fries. Our chicken sandwich was okay. If that was the only thing served, it would be a good chicken sandwich, but it was overshadowed by the other actors in this drama. Finally, the Tacos de Calle or street tacos with mango salsa and salsa verde with homemade chips was lovely. As my daughter observed, the salsa verde tasted really good. The pulled pork was melt in your mouth scrumptious

We saved room for gelato which was also recommended by fellow Yelpers. Can I say this, \"I LOVE MY YELP Community!\" The server behind the gelato counter was very generous, and we tried almost all the homemade gelatos there. We settled on petite servings of blood orange, raspberry and pineapple. The gelatos were sweet, tangy and tasted of fresh fruit juice with just enough ice. Happy birthday to my lovely husband who found Ground Control. I read a lot of negative reviews about the service. When we first arrived, we felt invisible for about 5 minutes, but that was soon corrected and our server took care of us following that five minutes. My son did observe that we had just entered at the tail end of the lunch hour rush, so we should be a little more generous. WE WILL DEFINITELY BE BACK!"}
{"text":"Ground Control, love the name and then you learn the tie-in with the Coffee and the Air Force ... it all makes sense.

As to the place... very good coffee (love the Mayan Mocha) and the Gelato (Blood Orange for me thanks!) and even the food is certainly worth the repeat visit.  We have not really had any service issues, this is more of a \"sit & stay\" coffee house vs. grab & run from what I have seen so it does take a little longer.  We don't get wine so nothing to report there!

Certainly worth the trip to try and come back again!"}
{"text":"Last night my husband and I enjoyed a wonderful evening at the symphony in downtown Phoenix. We considered getting pizza from Pomo's or Cibo, but instead we decided to support a local restaurant near our home. Prior to leaving the downtown area we looked up the website, which indicated the restaurant closes at midnight. We arrived around 10:20 pm and the sign on the door also indicated that Ground Control was open to midnight. The open sign was also on.  I walked in and a server told me it was closed. I recommend they update their website and signs with the new closure times. 

Fortunately, after checking on our doggies we found Mod's. It was 8 minutes before they closed when we arrived, but they happily welcomed us in. I enjoyed a glass of wine as we waited for our pizza to go."}
{"text":"This is one of the best places to enjoy a drink and some great food in the West Valley. 

The beer selection cannot be beat. Too often we drive to the east valley for a good tap selection, but Ground Control is just a short drive and has one of the BEST tap selections. 

We ordered pretzels (tasty!), honey hot wings (perfectly crispy), and the Hot Toddy pizza. The pizza was perfectly cooked in their wood stove and had a great flavor. 

To drink we tried a flight of sour beer, the DESTIHL Wild Sour Series, featuring the Dry-Hopped Sour, the Kriek, and the Smoked Gose. To round it out, I added the Almanac Farmers Reserve Pluot. My husband had the Anderson Valley Boont Amber Ale and then the Almanac Plout after he tried my flight. 

Finding gose or sour beer on tap has been difficult, but these did not let me down! I would've tried more, but responsible drinking overruled me. 

Our service was impeccable. The waiter, Paxston, was quick with service, drinks, water refills, but he also avoided that overly friendly waiter thing that some people can do. Several times he walked by with just eye contact, a smile and a nod, which was perfect. 

Overall an amazing experience!"}
{"text":"It's good to have a cozy coffee shop with some snacks on the menu. Their coffee are very decent. I usually order their \"fancy\" coffee, whatever the day's special is. I had the peanut butter latte and was really good. Their caramel latte is sweet but tasty. Today, I had just a cappuccino and a cheese danish. They were yummy!"}
{"text":"Horrible customer service..... We came here with a large group and heard good things about this place. This is by far the worst customer service I've experienced in a while. It literally took 45 min to get water and almost an hr to get our beers. I am not a complainer at all but I had enough when we waited so long. When I told the manager that this is out of control he said \"want me to cancel your drinks\". That is horrible customer service if you ask me. We will not be coming back to this place due to customer service. I only write reviews on yelp if the place was very good or very bad."}
{"text":"Please do not expect good service here.  Expect to basically beg for your server to acknowledge you and hope to be treated like a human being rather than the lowest form of scum on the Earth.  Don't expect management to empathize with you, rather hear how your server is the best they have, and come to your own conclusion about their service standards.  Expect excuses about \"weird\" nights and tough tables when all you want is the check to get out of this hell hole."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best selection of craft beers in the SW Valley, and the food is great! Try the Triple Double Pizza, the Tacos de Calle, or the Cali Pub Chicken sandwich. There is often live music on the weekend, and the gelato is great!"}
{"text":"Great find,  we were in the Litchfield Park area, hungry and 28 miles from home.   I pulled out phone and Yelped.  Ground Control stood out and sounded intriguing.      We walked in we were greeted by the barista.  The front has a coffee house vibe full selection of coffee, tea, iced, homemade bread goods, along with house made gelato and sobet.  Looked yummy.    Open seating in the restaurant with sections of seating options.  High tops, low tops, comfy chairs and bar.  

They serve a lot of IAP and incredible wine selection.   We saw several people enjoying flights along with platter of meat/cheese platter.   The place had about 6 tables of folks when we arrived but by time left it was full, nice crowd, young children to seniors. 

Menu has a large variety. Our server Nadine was friendly and helpful.  She suggested the pretzels with cheese.  Good selection, while I liked the cheese the honey mustard was great.   We selected the pork BBQ We for meal it's prepared in beer and homemade BBQ sauce, it's was exceptional so tender with great flavor along with the fresh cut fries.  Mom had same but opted for pamesian garlic fries....she loved them and entire meal.   She is already wanting to go back.  

Service with Nadine was awesome, she was attentive, made awesome suggestions and even got Mom a small sample container of BBQ sauce to try with her take home.  Mom had asked if they sold it , not yet but they should consider it.  We were also assisted by Paxston who was funny and helpful.   

Ground Control has a great vibe, excellent staff and an awesome selection of great food.    We will be back, 3 days later my 79 yr old mother is still talking about how good the food was and how cute Nadine and Paxston were.

Nadine and Paxston shared Taco Tuesday is an great day to dine.  Shared their taco options were the Best in the valley."}
{"text":"Really just an awesome place - pretty amazing food (try the garlic parm fries) and a great place to grab a beer! They definitely live up to their \"no crap on tap\" slogan, and they serve a mean cappuccino (they roast their own beans). We would definitely spend more time here if only the service wasn't so hit and miss - with it definitely being more miss- unfortunately. If you have the time just go to enjoy the atmosphere and food/drink menu go!"}
{"text":"Read all the fine reports in our community e-group. Read them here too.
People talk of the interior. To me very bland, not slick. But what is more surprising to me no one notices how unfinished the place is. My God the booth that is against the window next to the entrance has no finishing. Tacky tacky tacky. There is a nice big hole in the wall toward the back on the west side, again tacky. The wood on the counter, unfinished. The place has been open long enough for these things not to exist.  I understand they serve food, how would one know? Nothing to indicate such. So we ordered two coffees and one Gelato. The Gelato was wonderful. The coffee was at best lukewarm and tasted as if it were make from the powdered coffees one celebrates the special times in ones life. Very nice servers but slow as molasses. I was so surprised at what we found considering the good reviews I have read. But I think it might have something to do with who the owner is as we have a lot of retired Air Force in my community."}
{"text":"Decent food and a good selection of beer but the staff was inattentive. They seemed to linger without really engaging the patrons. I'd heard this of the place but wanted to go see for myself. There's a lot of other choices in the west valley so it's unlikely I'll return."}
{"text":"We keep trying Ground Control, hoping it will get better as we have so few non chain options in theGoodyear/Litchfield Park area. The drink options & gelato are always good. The food is hit or miss as is the service. My husband had a sandwich that looked like it was from Denny's. My meal was only slightly better. We had to request the drinks that came with the kids meals. I think they are trying to do too many things and the food suffers. The ambiance could be so much better. That fish tank needs to go, the layout and lighting need improvement. Feel like this place has been on the verge of being good for so many years but still misses the mark."}
{"text":"Similar to other reviews, great food, wine and beer selection, awful service!  I have NEVER had a good customer service experience here.  After finding a table, it usually takes a 1/2 hour to even have a waitress stop by and say hi, let alone take an order.  There is usually one waitress running around while the others sit by and meander from task to task.  It is so bad we no longer consider it as an option.  It's too bad because the good is soo good!"}
{"text":"Great muffins, breakfast food and espresso drinks. Gelato in the evening is excellent too. Haven't had dinner or lunch but will asap."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good, nothing overly exciting.  I was impressed by the wine selection.  I would give this place a higher rating if their service was better.  It has been lackluster at best."}
{"text":"I guess I agree with the 3 star rating the place currently has. I like the concept, love local joints, enjoyed their assortment of teas and wines, but that is about it. The service, timing, and environment needs work."}
{"text":"Date night at Ground Control was a blast and we had great service! My husband and I went here on a Saturday night. It was nice to have live music. Our server was friendly and attentive. We tried the wine tasting (lots of wine for the price!), bread with dipping, ham & brie panini & mahi panini with side salads, thai iced tea, and hazelnut gelato to top it all off! My husband also bought a bag of coffee beans on the way out the door. Everything was great. Unfortunately, it is pretty far from our house, but we would like to come back sometime, possibly with our kids."}
{"text":"Had the BBQ pizza outstanding! Will definitely go back and try the rest of the menu and a couple of beers.  The service was good during lunch normal wait time."}
{"text":"Love this place anytime of day! The coffe drinks are awesome! The gelato selection is amazing! The full dinner menu, beer and wine selection has something for everyone."}
{"text":"Yummy coffee and unique flavor combinations. It always excites me to find a place with different stuff to try. Service is always friendly and quick. One thing to note, I was told their default milk is whole but they do have others so f you don't like whole ask for anther."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place.  Gelato places are dropping like flies in Phoenix for some reason, but this place is going strong.  Probably due to the fact that their other offerings are incredible... fantastic  wine list, always some fun beers on tap, great sandwiches..."}
{"text":"Addicted to their Thai iced tea.  It's not the authentic Thai iced tea but I can't seem to stop drinking it.  Plus they have Gelato, Wine, and Coffee which translates to sugar, downers and legal addictive stimulants all in one place!  What more could you ask for.  I do miss my McKinley Salad.  I hope they would bring that back.  Great atmosphere, children friendly and very laid back."}
{"text":"Great food great service and close to home!  It was our favorite spot to come for pizza because they made the best white pizza in the West Valley. We came once a week at least, but they took it off the menu... due to the cooks not liking to make it is what our server told us. 

Well that sucks!!  Sorry all, but a place that takes employee preference over customer preference is not cool to me!"}
{"text":"My friend and I met there for lunch and basically served ourselves.  I had to ask for menus then 20 minutes later I waved down the waitress to place our order then I asked for napkins then I asked for silverware and finally, when I saw our waitress walking around with her handbag, I asked for our check!  At which time I was told to just come around the corner and take care of it.  The food was good but the service was Horrible!  Cute place that I thought would show the west side had some sophistication but....NOT!!  Dont think I'll be returning!"}
{"text":"The food and beer is amazing but the service usually is slow and sucky.  Don't come in with a time limit."}
{"text":"Tried to go here on a recommendation from a fellow firefighter. When I entered it was uncomfortably warm and stagnant air. I mean really guys it's summer in Phoenix turn down the A/C. I then was told I could take any seat I want and so I sat down and vegetated for about 10 minutes while the wait staff hung around the bar talking to each other. Alright time to go, I can easily get a beer somewhere else."}
{"text":"Why does this place have to suck so bad!?!? I show up 30 min before they close and the girl with the purple hair says she can't make me coffee unless it's cold because she took her dishes back to wash. Why wouldn't you do that when you close? I guess they need to do a last call for coffee as well as beer."}
{"text":"I've eaten here several times and have always really enjoyed the food and service. The staff is super friendly and welcoming. The pizzas are a must-have!! The atmosphere could be improved slightly with dimmer lights and moving the fish tank. Other than that it's a really enjoyable time when you're looking for drinks or a causal dinner!"}
{"text":"Litchfield Park appears to be a black hole of good dining. Or maybe a sinkhole of good dining options is more apt. I don't get it, Avondale has it's share of OK restaurants, and you can't spell Glendale without \"decent food\" but for some reason Litchfield Park's dining establishments are subpar. 

Ground Control is no exception. It bills itself as \"Gastropub, Wine Bar, Gelateria and Coffee Shop\" and it doesn't seem to do any of that particularly well. This restaurant has no idea what it wants to be. I'll tell you what it isn't--good. Looking past the Gelato Shoppe, Coffee Bar, Wine Store in the front third of the store. The back dining room is cold, dimly lit, and has a bizarre décor with a fish tank straight out of the 1980's, TGI Fridays Flair on the wall, and two VIP booths for some reason.  

The service here is atrocious. Our server greeted us with a grunt and slammed some menus down on the table. That would be the most he would \"speak\" to us throughout our meal at Ground Control. The food here was pretty terrible. My beer was flat and probably from the end of the keg. 

The baked brie appetizer was extremely oily, cold by the time it got to the table, and was served with broken crackers and sad apples. The Philly Cheesesteak was just steakumms meat shavings, old bread, shelf-stable cheese barely melted atop, and zero personality. The real loser here was the upgraded garlic fries as a side. The fries were cold mush served with globs of minced garlic, like they'd sell in a tube across the street at Fry's Marketplace. A better name for the garlic fries would be disappointment sticks. 

This place is in desperate need for one of those Food Network or SPIKE TV reality shows to make it over. Top-to-bottom everything on the restaurant side was abysmal."}
{"text":"Booked a reservation 2 weeks in advance for a going away party. Confirmed that they could accommodate the amount of people a week prior. We show up 15 minutes to seven, and nothing was ready for us. 30 minutes later we are still not seated. When we asked what the confusion was about, the manager lied and said someone had called her and told her that fewer people would be coming, which was not true at all. On top of this, the manager was extremely rude and not helpful. Half of our group simply left because of her attitude. We were not able to get waited on while we were there. The service has always sucked here. It seems like the less Lt. Col Rassas is involved, the worse it gets. It's a shame that my buddy had to leave the Air Force on such a downer."}
{"text":"Don't bother trying to go for breakfast. I have been going occasionally for the last 4 years and the cook randomly does not show up. How do you open a restaurant and not have the cook show up?"}
{"text":"24 taps with a great beer selection! That's it! Just go here for their beer thats it.. I have been to many places that serve good beer and every single one had great food. Ground  controls food is not good.  Ordered burger rare came in we'll done. The bun on the burger was Sara Lee I think. This place has a lot of potential if they can figure out how to make good gastropub style food."}
{"text":"You have to have the Cabo breakfast burrito. The aioli is amazing! Service gets pretty slow, though."}
{"text":"This was my second visit to Ground Control, my first was about this time last year. My first visit was with a childhood friend. Having enjoyed my meal so much the first time I decided to hold a business meeting here this time. 
I got there about mid morning. The place was deserted so I was instructed to seat myself by a young barista dressed in all black. 
I sat for about 4-5 minutes until a foot-shuffling server dressed in a black velour track suit brought our menus. I was shocked to see the delicious breakfast items I remember from my first visit are no longer offered (banana Nutella crepes, anyone?)
The offerings were nothing impressive. The pancakes were plain. Nothing special. My eggs, I can't remember the specific name of them but they had the word Tucson in them, were literally plain scrambled eggs with pico on the side and avocado on top. They were good but nothing my young son couldn't make on a Saturday morning. The diced potatoes were dry and overcooked. The two pieces of bacon that came with my meal were decent but again, nothing special. 
I invited my business associate to this location because I was looking to make a great impression. That was a fail. 
I thought that this place was kind of a specialty coffee bar but no mention was made by the server offering coffee, lattes or cappuccinos. I was disappointed. I didn't feel confident enough to order a random coffee so I drank water. 
Here's where it gets good- about 40 minutes into our meal/meeting an overwhelming chemical smell overtook the restaurant. We persevered with our meeting while the fumes kept getting worse and worse. I asked my associate and she said, \"they just lit the oven, I'm sure it's fine\". None of the servers really seemed bothered by it while I was getting increasingly lightheaded and woozy. 
I told my associate I needed to use the restroom (I intended to splash water on my face to see if I could feel better). When I opened the restroom door whatever toxic fumes were in the dining area were 20 times worse in the restroom!  I immediately turned around and asked my companion to go outside. While we were outside, a server came outside. I asked about the smell. She told us the owner was on the phone with someone. I told her, \"it better be the fire department\". She said, \"oh that's a good idea\" and went inside. 
We left. I vomited twice within 10 minutes of leaving the restaurant and was lightheaded and sick all day. I tried to contact the restaurant yesterday to find out what the smell was but no one answered. I assumed they were closed. 
I called the next day and was told by the person who answered the phone that ,\"I wasn't here yesterday but the pizza oven is working fine today\". I explained that based on my reaction yesterday I was concerned about the fumes. She refused to give me any information.  I'm aggravated because I feel like they didn't care about my health or my concern for my health. 
Please don't get me wrong. Accidents happen. Stuff happens but after I expressed my concern wanting to know what caused the fumes my request for information was rebuffed as if I'm merely curious. Not ok Ground Control. Not ok."}
{"text":"A neighbor and I went for lunch today.  Where do I start?  Greet by \"hostess\" was less than lukewarm.  Server was very pleasant, friendly.  Establishment was filthy.  Since it was empty (us and two other tables) at lunchtime, the food on the floor had to be leftover from days past.  There was construtction \"stuff\" all over the place.  Tables had to be bought at a second hand store.  Decent menu choices.  We shared an appetizer of the huge portion of fries which were good, but clearly from the bottom of the bag of frozen fries.
Will we ever go back.  no way   We were planning our next Girls' Lunch Out there.  no more
I might add that we both had salads.  One salad was swimming in dressing while the other had none.  The one salad was supposed to be a goat cheese.  MAYBE there was a tablespoon of goat cheese.
The spelling on the menu was atrocious.  Even the blackboard had misspelled words."}
{"text":"They've opened a new coffee shop in Verrado and a 10 min stop for coffee has turned into a long laborious affair.  If you want to be in a line for 30mins or so come to this place....
As for the Indian School location, service needs to be improved."}
{"text":"Gave the place several chances and shared my experience with the manager.  He spent more time defending the employee  (that needs customer service training)  than he did apologizing.  The response received was unacceptable.  Service was horrible, and I would question the sanitation practices of the wait staff.  It's too bad, the place has a great beer selection and the food is good but the general atmosphere is sub-par. Not going back."}
{"text":"This is my third time coming here, and while the food and drinks are awesome, the service is going to be the demise of this place. Seriously, an entire re-haul of their staff could completely turn this place around.

We arrived on a rainy Sunday (4 adults one kid) and it wasn't busy at all. We were told to find a seat, given waters and then ignored for the next 25 minutes. We even had to grab our own menus!

There were maybe 3 tables of people. When my friend approached the bar to let them know we were leaving, they acted completely indifferent and barely apologized. What a shame, I was looking forward to some delicious street tacos.

We left and came down the street to Tailgaters and literally had more service in the first 30 seconds than we did in the 30 minutes we wasted at GC. 

Do yourself a favor and don't get your hopes up for this place."}
{"text":"The hipster wizard with the 12 inch beard was amazing!! He definitely worked his magic on my family and I. We will definitely be back again and again!  Much love to that magical man!"}
{"text":"Nice variety of beer selection and has the \" top rated cider beer\" as well. I had the Diablo wrap, a must try if you are there. This place offers a variety; coffee, wine, beer for drink options. Food wise it has the main hitters with a couple of interesting entrees to choose from."}
{"text":"This is the best craft beer venue in the west valley. Ian does a great job putting great beers on tap. Always something going on and a nice place to spend an evening."}
{"text":"Ground control has been grounded! For horrible service tonight and horrible food! Pizza had no flavor at all, chicken was ash dry, had to literally flag down our server several times, as we were leaving we tried to salvage our visit with some gelato, we were told straight out, she wasn't going to get us any because she was going to start moping?? 40 mins to closing? It's a shame have been there many times and have referred several people and clients there, we like to support our local businesses, but this one is off the list now. Have they changed ownership ?? Horrible!"}
{"text":"Came with wife and kids and other relatives because this place was featured on Arizona Highways. We weren't sure if we had to wait to be seated or seat ourselves, no signage. Server at the front counter was nice and directed us to seat ourselves.

Our server came over and seemed annoyed when we asked to join two tables for a larger party. There were other servers hanging around. When the youngest kid in our party got a bit cranky, we got \"the stare\" from a server while other customers seemed a bit more understanding.

I ordered the burger, wife ordered the pork sandwich, kids had the cheese pizza. Food was better than ok but far from great.

I would recommend if it weren't for the mediocre service."}
{"text":"We had a very pleasant experience at Ground Control. We had a large party and we were able to find comfortable seating the moment we walked in (6:00 pm on a Saturday night). The waiter was very attentive and took our order immediately. The drinks arrived quickly and the food shortly thereafter. Most of us had wine flights and the selection of wine was very good. My husband and I shared a cheese plate and we loved it! The selection of cheese was excellent and was served with a fig compote, dried apricots and walnuts which highly complimented the selection. The price of the food and drinks was reasonable as well. The only reason I did not give 5 stars was because the interior could use some sprucing up. All in all this is a great neighborhood spot! We love it and we will be back!"}
{"text":"If you are very hungry, you can't go wrong with a Triple Decker Sandwich! It was surprisingly very tasty. 

The decorations and ambience was nice too. The server was kind and came by 3 times to check if we needed anything. Great place for business lunch or to have dinner with your loved one. Would not take kids here."}
{"text":"About four years ago, a former co-worker (who happens to be a total beer connoisseur) recommended this place to me. Unfortunately, it took a while before I actually got around to trying Ground Control. My girlfriend and I tried it out for the first time a couple months ago and enjoyed the atmosphere and creative menu. But I forgot to Yelp! about it...

Fast forward to this weekend and we were back again. The menu has changed again slightly, but it's still creative and a fun atmosphere. Ground Control isn't all about the beer though. It has a great rotating selection of very good beers on tap. But it's also a coffee shop up front. And unless you look at the sign, you might not realize their other specialty is gelato.

For this most recent visit, the appetizer was good, but not a good as the one we had last time. We chose a cheese tray with several options, including olives, sun-dried tomatoes and candied walnuts. The previous time we selected an incredible melted Brie and warm fruit jam combination. Maybe a little hit or miss, but still better than what you'll find at a lot of other places.

It's hard to miss the pizza oven next to the kitchen window, so I figured it was time to try it. They have several options or you can make your own combination. You can't go wrong here. These personal pizzas are huge. This would qualify as a small pizza anywhere else. My \"Blanca\" white pizza was awesome! Super hot, melted cheese, spinach, bacon and chicken. Very good!

Despite being busier than our previous visit, the service was excellent. Rob was prompt, friendly, and had very good timing. The variety at Ground Control is unique. It has a little something to offer everyone, from a beer to a meal, to coffee and/or dessert. I'm looking forward to trying some coffee on a future visit!"}
{"text":"Cafe Cubano latte hit the spot. I ordered two eggs sunny side up... just okay. The bottoms were scorched, so they were rubber like on the bottom, making them tough to chew.

I also tried the chocolate biscotti: very hard, so perfect for soaking in a cafe cubano prior to enjoying!

I look forwarding to go back.

Customer service good."}
{"text":"I really want to give them 4 stars but I can't. Maybe 3.5? We went in for breakfast. The coffee drink was fantastic but the wait was long for service and food. The food was only ok and I don't think it was as described in the menu. Overall a cute place. I will go back for coffee when I'm over here. The waiter was very nice but very busy. I think they need more staff although there was a guy who wasn't really doing anything who should have jumped in and helped the waiter."}
{"text":"AWESOME Beer selection!!! Awesome Food... Great place! I would say that it is like a gem in the valley, especially on the West side."}
{"text":"Heard they recently moved to a new location but this was my first time.  We had  a fantastic pizza from the brick oven as a group starter, Turkey club for me, reasonable prices and exceptional service.  It was a 99 degree day and one of the guys in our big party told the food server from the very first, to keep bringing him sodas as he was absolutely parched.  He was a bit over the top on his request (borderline rude) but the server kept pace with it all and his drink was never empty.

Besides the group pizza as a starter I had the Turkey club Sandwich and side for $8.00 which was wonderful, I chose the fries which I normally don't let myself have and they were tasty.  The turkey club sandwich had the right amount of crunch"}
{"text":"First time trying and will probably be the last time EVER. I came in and ordered a panini togo. After 5 minutes of ordering they tell me they ran out of turkey so they will give me chicken, how the heck can you run out of something when it was in the morning, not even the afternoon nor was it busy. the restaurant had about two tables, so I was hopeful the kitchen would finish my food under ten minutes. I was wrong it took about 25 minutes to get my sandwich. Not only did it take forever, they just handed me a box when it was done. Do they not have bags? wheres my fork for my salad wheres my napkins? The food, was nothing special, had a box full or arugula and a mediocre sandwich.. Maybe I'm just being picky..  but it was such a horrible experience I really did have high hopes...

If you want good sandwiches, FRESH desert, and good drinks; I suggest going to Sugar and Spice down the road they have never failed me."}
{"text":"Update: we keep coming back because we really want to like this place. I don't think we will be back. We waited for ten minutes before anyone talked to us. People who sat down after us had menus and drinks before we were even acknowledged. A couple sitting behind us had been waiting awhile also before the waiter finally came up to them. He approached them by saying \"you've been hiding! Has anyone helped you?\" When they said \"no, not yet...\" The waiter responded with \"well what do you want?\". It seems like that would have been a good opportunity to apologize for the wait and assure them they would be taking care of them. Anyways, after ordering food, it took a good thirty minutes. Nobody asked if we needed refills on coffee or anything. When the food finally did come out, it was alright. I ordered the tacos and my fiancé ordered the Cali chicken sandwich. The tacos were fine, though the meet was a little dry. The sandwich also fine. Not worth waiting so long and having no service. After four times here, I think we are done. 

Update 2: we came back on a Sunday morning and wow! Sooo much better!!! Our waitress was great. She approached us within 1 minute of sitting down and took our drink order. She was very attentive the whole time. Our food was so good too! We ordered the breakfast burrito and an omelette. Both were great. Seriously a 180 from how the food was before. The burrito was filled and the omelette had delicious mushrooms and bacon and tons of cheese. The coffee was so so good too. The waitress was nice enough to get heavy cream for my cold brew instead of half and half since I'm on a keto diet. It was delicious. Keep it up!!"}
{"text":"The staff are well informed of their products, and made us feel very comfortable assisting us with our choices.  I have been here twice; both times in the evening.  I have sat at the bar and drank some beer, as well as had a few tasters of wine.  The second time I was there we enjoyed a large french press coffee and one of their homemade cookies topped with their homemade gellato.  The seating was intimate and we were never made to feel rushed even though we were just about the last customers there. Their coffee beans are roasted on premises and the flavor is undeniably superior to any other fresh cup of coffee that I have had out there.  The atmosphere was very pleasant as there was live entertainment...that was a surprise bonus.  We plan on going there more often."}
{"text":"Friendly cashier. Table I sat at was not cleaned and the place was pretty dead so no reason there should be I cleaned tables. Chair I sat in was broken and pinched my skin. I was coffee was eh okay not great not really $3 something worth."}
{"text":"Love going there and seeing what Ian and his crew have added to the beer menu! Usually has a good variety of beers, so you can always find something you like!"}
{"text":"I Just ... Like This Place Alot.

Ground Control is not like any other coffee house but then again Ground Control is much more then a coffee house.  Ground Control has a relaxed feel and the food and service have always been excellent. Ground Control offers  daily and weekly specials at a very reasonable price.

On my very first visit to Ground Control I was drawn to the  Gelato case.  I have to admit next to a good Italian ice Gelato is my second sweet tooth weakness.  I will not  claim to be a Gelato expert, however, I have tatsed many Gelato's and I can say in  confidence that Ground Controls Gelato is the real deal, this  gelato is  very good.  I always struggle choosing between the lemon or blood orange (blood orange usually wins). 

I wish I could say that  I have tried many items off the menu but that just isn't the case.  The reason why I haven't explored more items off the menu is because I am addicted to the  pizza, which is cooked in a wood fired oven.  The pizza at Ground Control is excellent. Try the B-B-Q it's delicious (get a side order of garlic parm fries, very tasty)

The wine and beer lists are likewise excellent.
Ground Control is an ideal place to visit for a leisurely and inviting meal."}
{"text":"This owner also runs Ground Control in Verrado, my suggestion is to STAY AWAY. 
Poor service.  Poor food"}
{"text":"Unique west valley gem =)  One stop venue for yummy food, gelato, wine, beer or spirits.  Service is always great, and they have live music on weekends.  Perfect little happy hour spot, and diverse enough where there is something for everyone...even kids (not that you'd bring your kids to happy hour...)  Anyhow, I love Ground Control, my friends do, and so do my kids =)  Oh...great wine selection, best in the west valley in my opinion."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend to catch up and have a few drinks.  Love that there's live music of some sort on Fridays (or at least there was last night..?), and that the seating is cozy enough to settle in and stay a while.  Some areas are very private, which is great.  The drinks were decent, the staff was nice and extremely attentive...someone came by about every 3 minutes to ask if we were okay...but not in a bothersome or intrusive way.  They also assured us we were fine to stay longer when we realized they had officially closed up.  Ack.  Oops.  Hate that I was one of *those* customers.  But seeing as there were still a few other patrons scattered around, we just quickly finished our drinks and thanked them as we left...it was nice that they didn't shoo us out the door.  Kind of an odd location, but a fun option for this part of town."}
{"text":"Great food. Great beers on tap. Great ambiance. Horrible service. They are under staffed on busy nights, to the point that the owners are working the kitchen and bussing tables. Even then, tables have to wait 5-10 minutes to be greeted by their server. If the service was even mediocre, this place would get 5s across the board."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised to find this place still standing, we came here a few times a couple years back, but was disappointed this time because the service was extremely slow although there were hardly any other guests present. We came by to have some coffees and maybe a treat, we ended up only having one cappuccino (which was delicious but got cold really fast) and a giant cookie w/ vanilla ice cream (also tasty) we only had one cappuccino because the server took too long to check on us or a refill and we had to leave. I'm not a huge fan of their interior/atmosphere but would like to check it out one more time in the evening or during a tasting event."}
{"text":"Ground Control is in Goodyear, and I live up near Anthem. However, prior to moving up this way last year, we lived in Litchfield Park and visit GC at least on a biweekly basis. 

They specialize in REAL Italian Gelato, Fine Wines, Amazing world coffees, and great hors de uvres or light eating fair. We love this place. 

We usually sit at the bar and enjoy wine, salmon crostini, multiple cheeseboards, and other great eats. One of my treats are the Judith Baker chocolate truffles. 

Every one of their staff is attentive, friendly, and always there to talk about the wines. They are pretty knowledgeable and have recommended some amazing wines from all over the world to us. 

The owner is in the Air Force and has a penchant for Tequila! He has shared some great Tequilas with us as well. (Maestro Dobel, Casa De Azul, etc...) 

If you want a cool place to hang out, some good eats, some amazing gelato (Coconut is my fave because it smells like sun tan oil and tastes amazing), and/or just want to relax with the most Cafe Roma cup of coffee you ever tasted, this is the best bang for the buck. 

We do live far now, but about once every two months or so, we make it a date night, head to Ground Control (Live Music on Friday nights) and sit for hours. 

Recommend you try it!"}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere. I'll definitely come back once my bro is in town since he stays with my mom in Goodyear and we have nowhere else to go after dinner. The place offers gelato, coffees, beers, wines, live music on weekends, and a vibe I'm not aware of existing in this part of the west valley. 

That said, Mr Owner of Ground Control, may I suggest that when a first-time customer walks in (which your counterchick knows because she asked me), you devise some sort of system where he isn't told that he's not allowed to order his simple goddamn cup of coffee at the counter and that he has to instead go wait at a table for someone to go ask him first, which he then dutifully does, until he gets so sick of waiting after 15 minutes of being ignored that he gets up and leaves. 

I just wanted a coffee. I was willing to do the work for you by walking up to the counter and placing the order. When I bother giving you another shot, which might take a while, I'll consider upping the stars.

EDIT: Upped to 3 stars because of a polite response to my review by the owner of Ground Control."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, service excellent! Food was also very good. Went for happy hour and wine tasting with my daughter. I like the whites and she likes the reds. Artichoke and spinach dip was our favorite but also enjoyed the tomato mozzarella caprese and the Thai chicken tacos were good!"}
{"text":"This coffee shop is set up very nice inside. It has great coffee, and good service. I was very impressed with the quality of their product. Typically the hole in the wall coffee shops are the best and Ground Control does not disappoint. The only complaint I have is the price of the drinks are higher than most, and this is coming from someone who drinks at Starbucks regular. 

I would recommend trying this place out."}
{"text":"Nicest owners and staff, creative and fresh coffee creations and exceptional brewed coffee. I have not yet had a chance to try their gellatos, food or spirits but I visit this place every single time I visit my folks in AZ.

Soy is here for the vegan friends but sadly my favorite coffee creation has milk, honey and cinamon so that will be on the outs for you. I've spent many evenings here with a book or a sketch pad enjoying the sanity of my insane house around the holidays.

My mom raves of the book club and I've been sent a few of the books they read. Diverse and interesting. I would also be excited to try their beer tasting and wine tastings - maybe if the timing is right I will one day!"}
{"text":"Ground Control has the markings of a solid establishment. But the service was sub-par. The kitchen was closing more than 90 minutes before the restaurant closed. On top of that, the coffee bar was also shut down. Thankfully, they were able to make their \"Half-Baked Cookie\" which was more than fully cooked... The beer was above average, with good selection at a decent price. But overall, it wasn't very welcoming, nor did the staff seem interested in wanting to accommodate their patrons."}
{"text":"Great beer. Really great beer. Food is good but not great. We had a few beers and some garlic Parmesan fries. Have eaten here a couple times in the past and it's always pretty similar. The flatbread and pizza is decent but nothing amazing."}
{"text":"This place has so much potential! The food is actually pretty damn good but the service drives me insane. Not sure if it's because they are under manned, but the food takes forever! I've been there several times for breakfast and lunch at different hours, and the service has all been pretty slow."}
{"text":"The pizza is amazing, the best selection of microbrews you will find in the west valley, this is a dont miss place."}
{"text":"This is a fun little gem in the West Valley! We've been here for dinner and loved everything we've tried. I've also had their espresso & gelato- both very excellent. If you're looking for a local place where the food is delish look no further, they are doing it right here! I recommend the garlic or sweet potato fries and the basil pasta!"}
{"text":"I have heard a ton of good things about this place when it was at its old location so yesterday when I was getting together with a buddy of mine he suggested we go there for an adult beverage. I thought that would be cool because I am not a big drinker and I do enjoy tasty beers not your run of the mill beers you get at the grocery store.

We got there and the place was \"dusty\" the wine bottles were dirty and dusty and the place looked kinda thrown together. We sat at the bar and had a beer and sampled others when the \"Beer Expert\" started talking to us. He talked down to us like we were complete idiots. While I do know that I am no beer expert, I do know that this 400 pound blob of a man is no expert either and his attitude was sub par at best. I want to know what qualifications made this guy a beer expert other than the title on his shirt, I believe his name was Ian, stay clear of this guy. 

The bartender was very nice, she was very helpful and the beer was cold and unique other than that everything else was overpriced and not worth the drive."}
{"text":"Nice place to relax after a long day of work with a wonderful hand selected craft brew list and good eats. Only down sides are some arrogance amongst some of the servers with delays, and they are often out of beers from the list which can be frustrating. Otherwise a good place to have a small meal and a beer with delicious gelato for dessert."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was not bad. We came here 30 minutes before the place closed and we weren't attended for a good 8 minutes. This was the first and last time I come here."}
{"text":"Great place to pick up a craft beer in the West Valley! Love to visit this place on a weekly to biweekly basis, and every time they have different beers on tap. Staff is knowledgeable about their beers and the food is great . if I could recommend one thing it would be to work on cleanliness of the place, a few times I've sat down to a table that's been dirty or had food on it. However, I don't go there for the fine dining atmosphere, I go to pick up a great beer, and Ground Control never disappoints."}
{"text":"They truly have the best coffee around.  They bring the beans in green and roast them themselves.  They use the Swiss water process for decaf.  I've never had a bad coffee from them and take beans home to use.  

I have mostly had breakfast here and every breakfast has been excellent.  The staff is always friendly.  

Try the salted caramel gelato.  It's to die for."}
{"text":"I have lived in the West Valley for a year and have never been here until today. What a waste of a year! This is my new favorite place to eat and I will be shocked if that changes any time soon! If you have not eaten here, you are missing out. If you have, shame on you for not telling me about it. ;-)  Service, atmosphere, service, drinks...everything is outstanding!"}
{"text":"The beer selection is great!  We enjoyed the pizzas and the ambiance, everything."}
{"text":"After hearing and reading all kinds of reviews, we decided to check G C out.  A Saturday early afternoon.  Sat at bar.  Had The Worst customer service by the bartender.  No smile, no suggestions.  Husband ordered a draught beer.   I ordered a cocktail that had about 3 ice cubes.  Asked for a lime + was told \"oh i dont have any cut right now.\"  What?!!!  So Cut One!  Lazy.  
Left after 1 drink."}
{"text":"Ground Control: A fun place to chill and relax but don't rush.  I started coming here multiple times over the last few weeks because it serves as a good place to meet with friends and study.  Ground Control has an amazing business concept but it seems like they are trying to do so much and provide so many services that they miss the mark in some areas. They cannot be reviewed on one thing alone. I understand why they get one star for some reviews. Getting good service is hit or miss. Let's start with the front. The coffee area is great!! Coffee is always good and consistent and reasonably priced to compete with Starbucks prices.  The bar area is great! There prices are decent and there selection is impressive for a small business, plus I like the events they present to get patrons to try new beer. There restaurant side is where they need improvement. Their food is actually pretty tasty compared to other gastro pubs, their problem is the service.  Just as other reviewers have stated. I went a couple weeks ago and got terrible service because the girl working the coffee side was also working the restaurant. We were looking for our checks or even a refill on our waters and pops, while she stood up front checking her cell phone. Today I went and the experience was the exact opposite, our server was super friendly and nice and even took the time to remember our names and welcome us.  So overall ground control is a good place to visit to get a coffee or a beer and relax. Coffee 5 stars, beer 5 stars, restaurant 3 stars."}
{"text":"Great place! Great wine!

Sometimes the service can be a little slow or in our case the server gave us menu's then when she came to take our order she told us the items we chose were out of stock since the day prior. So it would have been nice to know that, lol."}
{"text":"Great friendly service ! Owner doesn't seem care ; employees are dedicated ! Beer selection is the BEST in the West valley !"}
{"text":"I don't think this place has intentionally bad service - the folks that work here seem pretty nice (if a little young) but the service and the service time is bad... and having been here starting over a year ago, I think it's getting worse.  

The food is good, the place is charming, but the seats are falling apart and I've been sitting here for (literally, I checked the clock) 45 minutes without anyone saying anything to me.  This is the worst it's ever been and there's really no excuse.  

I hope the owners are reading these reviews because they are losing business and regular customers as a result of this.  

A good place if you've got an eternity to wait..."}
{"text":"Food is okay, the service is horrible . They shouldn't have the option of open seating if they aren't able to service each guest in a timely manner. They're way over staffed and the workers didn't accommodate for ignoring us longer than 20 minutes. The only reason we didn't leave was because my lunch was timed and we wouldn't have been able to grab food otherwise. Highly disappointed and if I could give less than 1 star I would.


***UPDATE***

They gave us the wrong tacos, we're both pescatarian and have been for years and they served us tacos with pork in it. Never going back !"}
{"text":"Lots of drinks to choose from - coffee, wine, beer, tea, etc. Also, they have food. I love to come here to meet with friends. It has a warm and inviting environment. Plus, WINE!! Friendly employees. Love this place."}
{"text":"I don't know why people are complaining about not getting taken care here... I was asked if I was being taken care of within 5 minutes of sitting down, then given a menu and then they took my drink order, which was brought out minutes later.  The waitress was super nice and checked on us frequently. There were quite a few other patrons there as well, but we didn't wait much for anything. I love the atmosphere here as well. My 10yo liked it too and he's super picky. All in all, I'd recommend it to anyone wanting good food and good beer with a very relaxed environment. Those other complainers can go elsewhere!"}
{"text":"Really love this place! They have an awesome Black bean burger and sweet potato fries. They have more than just beer and wine they also have a hard ciders! They hold wine tasting one Tuesday. This place also has gelato.  I would recommend sitting in a booth or out on their patio when it is not hot."}
{"text":"Best cup of coffee I have ever had. The owner roasts his own beans and the coffee is pressed.  They also have wine and beer tastings and delicious gelato. A very nice place to hangout and relax. They have food which is ok but I go for the cup of coffee and the beans I buy to take home with me."}
{"text":"My wife and I come here often, mainly because the coffee is good. I often buy my whole fresh-roasted beans here. Usually, they're great. That's the reason for the 2 stars. The food is ok. But if I had to rate this place on service, I would give it zero stars. 

Tonight's experience was typical. We waited at a table for 15 minutes before being waited on. I ordered a coffee drink which, after another 10 minutes still wasn't made. The \"barrista\" was chatting with a friend. The place was not busy. When I asked if my coffee was coming, she acted surprised and started to make the drink. 

Waiting for the check was another thing...

If you're into waiting (but not being waited on), this is your place."}
{"text":"Great beer - this place has the best craft beer on tap in the West Valley and the food is amazing.  I had complaints about the service in the past but it has greatly improved.  The bartender and waiting staff are very friendly.  Good job!"}
{"text":"Love the vibe and look of the place.  Seats all around the place (inside and outside).  The coffee smells were so good!!!  We came here for treats after dinner.  We were greeted by the guy working in the behind the counter.  He told us to grab a seat and a waiter will be with us.  Cool!  

We sat for about 5 to 7 mins before someone came by.  We noticed some of the tables were a little dirty and an employee cleaned the table by wiping with his sleeves.  We finally got our orders in and the drinks and gelatos came out slow.  Only 3 of us had our stuff with the other 2 staring at us.  The homemade gelato was great.  Everyone said the drinks were good.  

Service is slow, place needs to tidy up, & the restrooms were pretty dirty too."}
{"text":"Holy crap where did this place come from? Always thought it was a cofee only place, but there is a restaurant in the back and holy shyte is it good!  I went ham on customization!!! 
Biscuit n Gravy 2 eggs add Chorizo, Avacado and Gouda! I'm about to lick this plate ya'll.  Hats off to this place and I will be back! The mil disc is a nice touch too. Cheers"}
{"text":"So I decided to give Ground another chance in their new location.  Despite the horrible service in the last location.  Big mistake!  I was ready to place my food order and was told the cook was \"absent\".  What the heck..........  DO NOT RECOMMEND !!!!!!"}
{"text":"I waver between 3 and 4 stars on Ground Control.  On the 4 star side they do have the best microbrew selection in Avondale/Goodyear/Buckeye area.  And the food is good! It's an odd mix of bar and gelato or yogurt take out in front. Personally I think they'd be better off closing the gelato area and use that staff to improve the restaurant area experience.  I have had 2 bad experiences with service so slow and unattentive that the last visit was strictly going to be for beer. Service was much better, not only quicker but attentive.  We ended up adding food on because of him.   Hope that future visits keep it up, because the reality is a good beer selection will only go so far!"}
{"text":"Best coffee ever! Love this coffee shop every is so friendly. I like all the coffee drinks especially the iced coffees. Great hangout area."}
{"text":"I will keep my review open an unbiased due to the time of day I visited Ground Control. 

As a first impression I enjoyed the environment and ambiance of this shop. The combo of coffee shop and wine bar is not often ventured in most places, especially the west valley. I indulged myself with a mocha that was quite smooth and full bodied.

This seems like a great hang out spot on weekends or nighttime if they have a wine tasting event. 

Ground control is bringing back that connection of a coffee shop being relaxing , inviting and intimate; not like what corporate giants have transformed the common perception of coffee shops now days to be.

My full interpretation will adjust for better or worse as I continue to visit this place."}
{"text":"I like so many others are thrilled about the reopening of the best gem in the West Valley.  Yes there is still work to do as the last review pointed out, but I feel like they believe every guest is a guest in their own home.  They have not had a grand opening yet so I am to assume this is there soft opening, their chance to get their ducks in a row.  I for one am thrilled.  This location, the service and the chef all seem light years ahead of what was already the best most unique place in the west valley.  If you want antiseptic and impersonal, please continue herding yourself into the plethora of chains that infests the west valley like a bad rash.  I have opened several restaurants and I understand the mountains of work, hassles, and finances it takes.  This family welcomes you in and offers what ever they can do for you.  What else could you ask for?"}
{"text":"People should ignore the negative reviews on Ground Control. The west valley really needed a modern midrange restaurant that serves good food. Ground Control has a bit of a Ling & Louie's vibe, if you're familiar with them.

The service was good and so was the price. It seems to me that Ground Control established itself somewhat while at the Verrado, and should hopefully integrate easily into this location."}
{"text":"Best craft beer place on the west side of Phoenix.  Good food, friendly staff, wine, coffee, gelato and more. Nobody cares more about their customers than Ground Controls beer guy, Ian.  Nobody in the valley does more and works harder to get the best tap list in town."}
{"text":"Dead cricket in the bottom of my coffee. Service horrible. Kid that opened looked like he had not even went to bed yet. Opened late. We had about 7 guys that were meeting there for coffee. When I brought the cup with the dead cricket in the bottom (yes I drank it) all he could say was oh sorry. And he could not do a refund the manger had too and there was no manager there. Surprised health department has not shut this place down."}
{"text":"The service is terrible and my order is consistently incorrect. I used to go every single morning before work for a smoothie and breakfast to go. I got the same thing every morning and my food was never ready when I arrived and if it was it was made incorrectly. Every few weeks there would be someone new working and the previous worker was gone. The gelato is the best thing about this place but the service is so terrible it's not worth it. Spend your money somewhere else."}
{"text":"The food is amazing. Beer selection is fun and interesting. I definitely recommend stopping by to check this place out. Flat bread pastrami sandwich was so delicious! Street tacos were awesome as well."}
{"text":"I have now been to Ground Control twice including today, the pizza was very good but the customer service has been horrible both times. The initial greeting you receive when you walk in is non-existent, then without a hello we are told to sit where ever we want, considering 95% of the tables had a reserve sign on them they should have just sat us. Then the server, we will not consider him Mr. Personality."}
{"text":"We came here for breakfast a few days ago. It was amazing. Great healthy food and delicious coffee. We didn't really go into the larger restaurant part. We decided to come for drinks and dessert tonight.  The place has a severe identity crisis. Is it a. . . Gelato bar? Wine bar? Pizza shop? Is the decor . . .Modern? Industrial? Is it. . .Self serve? Table service? The answer is yes to every question. The service was slow. We weren't even acknowledged for about 5 minutes. The waitress was friendly, but not overly helpful. While seated in the restaurant, I was told that if I wanted Gelato on top of my cookie, I needed to go over and look at the flavors at the front of the restaurant."}
{"text":"My Best Friend, Kaitlin A, already ripped this place a new one...
I wasn't as disappointed with this place as she was, however I am not really that impressed either. 

I have only been the one time and it was before I was 21. As others have previously mentioned they have an extensive beer and wine selection, but it is a coffee house. That's cool, no big deal. But I feel like their list of wine and beer is much bigger than their list of coffee drinks.

They have live music sometimes, which is cool. I like the big fish tank.

The prices aren't bad. My drink (the toffee coffee thing) wasn't the best thing ever, but it also wasn't the worst.

I will have to go back at least one more time and write an update."}
{"text":"I went to Ground Control for the first time last night and I was unimpressed. The food was pretty good but the service stinks. They need some mature staff who can take care of their patrons, not the young kids playing kissy face with their girlfriend at the bar.  The cheeseboard for $14.00 was less than impressive with a couple of slices of cheese and a few nuts and dates. I think I will pass next time."}
{"text":"I have been here multiple times and have never had a problem.  But tonight we came in and it was very busy, we put our names on the waiting list and were told that it would be 30 mins.  We then proceeded to the bar to have a drink, we stood at the end of the bar with no one in front of us being ignored  for 20 minutes at least before we were even acknowledged.  Then we were notified that they gave our table to someone else because they could not find us (the hostess walked right past us 3 times while we were at the bar).  
After about 20 more minutes we were seated and our waiter was great  
Overall not a good experience"}
{"text":"Worst service ever ! My food came out after everyone eat, we ask to the server and he say \"the food came out, when came out !!!! I eat with out soda because the server never bring a refill. Worst experience ever !!!! Never came back the food was also cold !!"}
{"text":"The food here is average and for a reasonable price. There is decent live music on Saturday nights.

The service however, really bad. Our server never mentioned to us that they had a special wine flight available for the night, we overheard another server telling our neighbor. We never received our waters, after asking 3 times over about a 30 minute period. After we ordered our dessert we waited another 45 minutes before our server returned, we asked for the bill and waited about 15 more minutes. The table next to us that had the same server were equally annoyed by the server's absence. The owner/manager was walking around and tried getting his attention, and was told he would get back to me in a moment, but never returned before we left.

This is a very small place and they could do really well in terms of service if they had the right people and the right training...... I MIGHT come back in a few months to see if the service has improved...but be warned."}
{"text":"Love this place, their coffee drinks ROCK (esp. the Cafe Roma!) and their sandwiches and salads are TO DIE!! Awesome joint!!"}
{"text":"ground control was a nice little find.  after searching the desert for premium craft beers (which VERY few places offer true craft beer) group control came up and did the deal.  went and enjoyed a couple really nice Alpine Brewing Duets as well as a pizza.  Anyone who follows the west coast ipa brew scene knows that Alpine is one of those increasing difficult to obtain outside of San Diego county so this was a real unexpected surprise.  beers were $7 which is high, but not ridiculous and growler fills for that one in particular was $16 if memory serves.

our server, who I don't recall was kind of a mental gidget, but he tried hard so that's all I guess I can ask for.

food was all really well done.  pizza was incredible.  crust perfectly cooked.  also had the wings as an appetizer, with dry rub.  cooked well, not greasy.  hint of curry to the rub.  not the greatest I've had but really far from the worst too.  I think I'd try another flavor next time, if only to mix it up.

all in all i'll absolutely be retuning next time I'm in the valley.  It's worth the visit."}
{"text":"Super yummy food
 Waiter wad just ok. I got chicken wings that were amazing. It's not a great place for kids though."}
{"text":"Amazing food... mediocre service... horrible wait times.   If you've got an appetite and a couple hours to wait; this is your place.  The food is excellent, the menu has changed due to rotating staff and management but everything is always fresh and delicious, especially their gelato.  It's brought in by an outside vendor but it's made from scratch every day.  The West side needs more restaurants like this, just with faster service!"}
{"text":"We had the IT  Combo sandwich, a combination Italian Beef and Sausage. It was great. I especially liked the au jus that came with the sandwich so one could dip it if they liked. Yum.

They have 20something taps of draft beer, all craft beer as opposed to massbrews, I think. It's a pretty good selection indeed.I had the hoppy cider. i didn't like it at first, ut it grew on me pretty quickly. I liked it a lot by the end of the pint. It's good stuff. 

My only problem was the bad service. The service was pretty darn terrible, bur thwe food was really good, and the beer selection is great."}
{"text":"Not bad.  I liked their Verrado location a lot more.  The food is just ok.  The almond milk latte I had was absolutely delish!  The service was friendly, but slow.  I walked in to receive a wonderful greeting from the barista at the front.  They had a great beer selection too.  I will definately try the scene at night as it seems that is when most of their crowd draws."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying I LOVE supporting local businesses so I was very happy to see this next door to the nail shop. I got a cold brew with half in half (they didn't have heavy whipping cream which I originally wanted so stuck with the half n half) and sugar free vanilla syrup. My boyfriend got to gelato with the espresso shot in IT and it was to DIE for! I will most likely be back. Especially since I just saw pictures of pizza on here. But If they could get heavy whipping cream and maybe more sugar free syrups that would be cool with me! Can't wait to try more drinks!"}
{"text":"Fantastic. Just a fantastic little place. Breakfast, lunch or dinner, it has all of it. If you don't like this place, either you have no patience or your standards are so high that you're just a spoiled person who can't appreciate the effort of others."}
{"text":"Service is excellent ! I've eaten here twice once for lunch and once for breakfast and both times loved what I ordered. The coffee is delicious.  Next time I have to try the pizza they make in their own pizza oven. The credit card machine was down this morning so we got our breakfast free which is an awesome added bonus"}
{"text":"The long and short of it.... The foods better than the coffee.  It does have good gelato but still would pass on the coffee."}
{"text":"This is the best pizza in my opinion in L. Park. Wood burned pies and the ambience is nice. They also give military discounts."}
{"text":"We've previously had decent experiences here, however, this was not the case on Friday night. We chose ground control because we were craving their wood fired pizza. When we walked in, you could feel the chaos of the staff. They all seemed stressed out. We were told to pick our own table and we would be followed with menus. The only two tables large enough for a party of 3 were both cleared of the last tables dishes, however, neither had been wiped down. The table we chose still had straw wrappers and such but the hostess didn't even notice (if she did, she didn't care). I asked her if someone could clean it which I shouldn't have had to do. She grabbed a wet towel from another table and gave it a little wipe. She then took off to the kitchen because someone yelled \"table 12\" and failed to give us menus. Another employee walked over and said he would be right back with menus, which never happened. Then a third employee walked over and said the same thing. Meanwhile there was a huddle of servers in the middle of the dining room and again, it was painfully obvious they were stressed out. It's very sad that there is ZERO management/owner presence in a locally owned establishment. Your staff needs guidance and maybe just a couple more employees to help with the crowd. We left because we knew what kind of experience we would have had if we chose to stay. 

I gave two stars because we have previously dined here and enjoyed it. I will still recommend the place for someone looking for good beer."}
{"text":"This is for the coffee side. One barista doesn't cut it especially when she wants to bs with her hipster bff's.  35 mins for a simple coffee drink is bat s**t crazy. No thanks"}
{"text":"Not sure what this place is trying to be....What is with the aquarium ? The food was ok...nothing to get excited about. The beer was great. The restrooms were a filthy, stinking mess...literally. If they can't keep a restroom clean, what does the kitchen look like ?  I doubt if we will return.....very disappointed."}
{"text":"Update: 
Was in again and the place was still being constructed.  Did talk to a manager that explained they had run into many issues in trying to open.  The Coffee drink I had was excellent.  I think with time they should get better.  Kinda like a good wine I guess.  I give them three stars hoping for the day they are finished and I can increase this to 5 stars.  There coffee drinks are very good.

First visit New place:

Hope they get it together but with experience today I have to give them one star.  Total chaos and the place seems along way from being in shape to open but they are open.  Construction stuff all over the place.  Scaffolding in front of pizza oven.  Not enough employee's to offer good service and they were not even extremely busy.  

Employee's they did have only one guy seemed to know what he was doing and how to do it.  He did make an OK Iced americano but no creamer containers only a coffee cup with lid full of half and half to help your self.  Asked for milk in my drink said it was serve yourself which is fine if they had it where I could serve my self.

Don't know who made the decision to open before they were ready at new location but Management needs to re-think there decision.  Open when you are put together!"}
{"text":"Good food and nice atmosphere but it really is about service. 

Each time I come back I want to really like it but the service isn't very good. On our most recent visit it took a while for anyone to notice someone was there and it wasn't busy. No menus, had to go get them ourselves. Sat and waited for service and then again for the check. Asked for the check an he didn't even remember what we ordered. 

Going to wait a long while to come back. I like their food and wine and beer selection but can't make up for subpar service when
there are so many other good places to go."}
{"text":"I had a more positive experience than the previous reviewer- but then again I did not order coffee.We went here one night to here a friend of a friend perform and I have been wanting to go back since. 

We ordered wine and gellatto and were not disappointed. The wine list has a good variety and offers a couple of flights. They also have 2 beer flights available both were good and came with nice sized glasses. The gelatto has a nice variety and every flavor we tasted received a thumbs up from the party. They have a menu with panninis and salads- none of which we tried but the temptation was there.

The service was not fabulous but we were too distracted to really feel the effects of that."}
{"text":"I wanted to take my family for a good cup of coffee and some dessert last night. I decided to go to Ground Control since it was open late, they have a big new establishment now, and the last time I was here, I remember the coffee being delicious. 

We walk in and order coffee up front from the baristas and sit down in hopes to order dessert. As I'm sitting down, the waiter looks STRAIGHT at me and goes to another table. So I figure maybe I'm not in his table area. The rest of my group sit down and we wait. And wait. And wait. The same waiter is in our area but never acknowledges us. After  ten minutes, we start to actually wave him down. STILL no acknowledgement from him. He preferred to go to his other tables.

I was so upset and felt like I wasn't welcomed there. So after we finished our coffees, we left without any acknowledgement from staff except one who happened to be nearby cleaning a table. One of the greatest faults a place of business has is when they don't make their customers feel welcomed. We were a group of five people and yet were completely invisible to staff. 

I don't think I'll be coming back for a LONG time. I can't recommend a place that doesn't acknowledge customers and make them feel invisible. I wish I can give no stars to this establishment but I have to give some  for good coffee. What a shame."}
{"text":"Wish i had enough time to go try the food when i was there. I just had some drinks to go.

They really do a fine job with their lattes. Out of the places i have tried in the last month (aside from spots i frequent) this was easily the best. Definitely wont be going out there to frequent because that is just way out of the way.

But definitely if you have time to spare and need a delicious caffinated drink. I'd recommend ground control. I'd love to try them out during the evening when it looks like they turn into a nice wine and beer restaurant."}
{"text":"Ground Control is a local business we enjoy going to. It's close to home and they have great food and good beer on tap. Tonight we were very disappointed with our service. Joseph served us and he was often no where to be found. There was a total of three tables in the entire restaurant. I had to get up to get my own napkins & silverware after my sons dinner was brought to the table. My Boyfriend ordered the Beach Bum pizza and bit into a screw! A stainless screw! We brought it to Joseph's attention and he offered to make another pizza we declined. When he brought the bill we were shocked that he didn't take the pizza off. I work in the service industry and I know that things happen but you take care of the customer! I still tipped Joseph 20% because it's the right thing to do. However, the lack of customer service will be fresh in my mind the next time we consider going to Ground Control."}
{"text":"Great selection of craft beer.  They offer growers and you can buy cans as well.  We have been twice and the food both times was good.  It wasn't great and that's what Kept me from giving it five stars.  Also service depends on the server.  We had great service one night and average the next visit.  Pizza was tasty.  They offer a military discount.  We just moved to the area and it's definitely going to be a frequent craft beer stop."}
{"text":"This place has an awesome beer menu. A must for a beer lover (which I am). The pizza is pretty great too. Service wasn't spectacular. They were out of a beer and I asked if the brewery had any other offerings and the guy said \"I am not sure, I don't think so\", but didn't seem all that willing to check for me. So, I went with something else. Otherwise I would have given them a 5! It was that good."}
{"text":"Ground Control, a place that can't decide what it wants to be. Part Korova Milk Bar, part warehouse store room, part aquarium. Throw in some coffee, wine, beer and some randomly placed tables and you got it. A confusing mess of restaurant decor.

When it comes to horrible food they have you covered as well. Ensure to enjoy a side of ranch flavored water with your uncooked chicken wings. Your wings will come doused in a creative flavor of  honey hot pineapple BBQ chipoltle sauce. It comes to you cold bones and all with just enough pink to tell you, that your chicken is served at a cool 68 degrees. Salmonella perfection!

All in all it's a great place to take your worst enemies to. Just be sure to drop them off and drive away."}
{"text":"Decided to come here at 7:30 for a coffee meet up with a friend. Our waitress told us that we have to order soon because the kitchen is closing soon before we even sat down! Mind you, they were closing at 10 PM. It wasn't a great way to greet customers. At least wait for us to be settled before telling us. Food was okay and coffee was okay. Price did not match what is on the menu and what is on the board for coffee. Overall experience wasn't good so I will probably not come back due to the unpleasant service."}
{"text":"I hadn't been since my last review until I  went recently with a friend, the menu was updated, I was very pleased with my wrap and garlic fries. I am not sure if it was a bad day or they have since fixed some things, I used to love coming here so I was pretty upset that the meals were so poor last time. My waitress \"Boo\" was fantastic, attentive and kind, after my most recent experience I will be back."}
{"text":"Just moved to LP and got to try out Ground Control.  I've been wanting to come here for awhile and we liked it.  Service was great, our server was very friendly and helpful.  The ambiance is a little strange to be honest.  It strikes me as 2 different places...the 'wine' side more modern, the 'beer' side more industrial...kind of freaked me out at first but I think I get it.  It is not exactly my kind of vibe cause I am definitely a wine bar girl over a beer pub kind of gal..that being said the wine we were served (house) was very good and a generous pour.  My husband loved his meal (said it was one of the best pork sandwiches he'd ever had), however I was unimpressed with my salad :( but the garlic Parmesan fries are awesome-served up with a great aioli.  
I love that you can walk in and order a coffee or gelato-that part sells me as it's so European :) glad this place is close.  We will return!"}
{"text":"We were visiting some friends that lived nearby last week and decided to try Ground Control, mainly on the basis of the 2-for-1 coupon that we found in our Entertainment book.  We were greeted quickly by the barista/waitress/server and found our seats.  (Note:  I wonder if this places doesn't try to hard to be too many things, coffee, gelato, food, wine bar, beer selection...).  

The lunch menu consisted of mostly panini's and salads.  I chose a panini that had pastrami, some sort of cheese and mustard on it...I'd like to be a little more descriptive, but the website does not have a food menu for some reason.  Whatever it was (I think it was called the Viper)...it was fantastic!  I really really enjoyed this panini.  Which is good because I was definitely annoyed with how long it took to get the food.  Sure, there were only two people working, but it is not as if this place was anywhere near busy.  

My wife's chicken panini was okay...but the side salad that it came with was quite lame.   Iceberg lettuce was some balsamic vinegar on it.  Which is fine for a side salad, but we saw some people next to us with what appeared to be side salads and they had some real nice greens.  Maybe they ordered something else...but my wife laid off the salad and stole some of kettle chips instead.  

If I was going based solely on my food, I'd give at least four, but I'm including the slow (note:  it was still very friendly) service and lame salad, so Ground Control gets 3 stars."}
{"text":"Just want to update fellow Yelpers on my experience with this establishment.  The owner Tara personally messaged me on here to let me know the wi-fi was fixed and to thank me for my business.  I am currently in Ground Control and everything is working great.  Bumping my rating back up to 4 stars for the pro-active communication and service by the owner of Ground Control."}
{"text":"Everytime I go the service and food is different.  I have been there 3 times for food and drinks. 2 out of the 3 times the food was amazing and the wait staff new their stuff about the food.  The other time (this is the very next week same day) the food was not very good and the wait staff along with the bartender had no clue about the beer and wine they served.  They generally don't keep people very long so I am assuming that the differences in service and food are because of that."}
{"text":"I have been to Ground Control several times now. I will say that their cheese, fruit and nut plates are delicious but when your 19 year old server can't recommend a good wine (at a wine shop!!), this is a MAJOR problem. 

The most recent (and final) time I was there, our server took our drink orders an got them out fairly quick...and then a party of 6 showed up and we didn't see her for the rest of the night. I am not exaggerating. I had to order a drink from someone at the coffee counter (which I never received after waiting over half an hour), and when we were ready to go, no one would have noticed if we just walked out...because it took another twenty minutes just to get our check!

I will never be back just solely based on the horrendous service."}
{"text":"I've been to the original location and this semi-new one off Camelback.  Service is good, staff is friendly.  Wine and beer selection is good. Pricing is reasonable. I've tried a few of the breakfast items, you would be ok to pass on them: bacon, potatoes. Place is clean and well laid out. I have not used the restrooms.  Good coffee selections as well. Support local!"}
{"text":"Fantastic beer selection! Food is great. I got the Cali Pub Chicken sandwich and upgraded to the garlic fries. It was so good that I went back and got the same thing the next week. Definitely one of my favorite places on this side of town."}
{"text":"I like to support local business and was excited to try this spot.  I have been seeing the NOW Groupon for a few months and finally decided to buy it  ($6 for $12) and check it out.  I read the fine print and there was nothing that limited to dine in, so I came in ordered 2 coffees and 2 deserts.  When I was ready to pay and said I wanted to use the Groupon the cashier said no, its for dine in only.  When I tried to explain that the it didn't say that, she got snippy, said something about the owner and refused to honor the Groupon.   And her attitude was less than friendly after that.  So here is the scoop...Ground Control could have had a new customer, I go to paradise bakery about once a week for coffee and a bite, and I would have spent the $6 on the Groupon, plus another $8 since my check added up to $20....but now I will NEVER go back.. I will warn others about the misleading nature and bad attitude and hopefully see a different business in that spot in the months to come.  SHAME on you Ground Control!   Not to mention the coffee really wasn't that great."}
{"text":"We have been going to Ground Control for a few years now. The staff really knows about beer, and the food is always so good. 
Try any of the pizzas, and the chicken quesadilla is pretty awesome too. My kids enjoyed the grilled cheese and cheese burger. In a time where so many places are trying to make things trendy it's nice to come to place that puts effort into their food, and put effort into their service as well. Thanks Ground Control. Keep it up!"}
{"text":"We went there this past Sunday in a party of 12. I have to jump on the band wagon of past reviewers and say that the service is well below par. But first, let me mention the most important thing; the air conditioning was not working properly. There we were at a large gathering, backed into a corner with sweat rolling down our faces for a couple of hours. The waitress said she would turn it down, but then another employee let it spill that they had been having trouble with the AC breaking down for several DAYS! It would have been nice to know this before we all sat down and ordered. Bad  restaurant karma I would say. What goes around comes around.
Next, the waitress did not bring us coasters even after being asked three times, did not set us up with silverware, and generally acted like she didn't care much about our requests. My husband had to reminder to bring a refill of his wine three times before it was brought. Another young man finally brought our coasters and extra napkins (for all the sweat) and our set ups. 
Friends in our party had pizzas and they looked fantastic. Hubby had the steak salad and it was good also. I had a basic hamburger and it was fine. Everyone seemed quite happy with their food. Bottom line - Food/ good; Service/ Poor. Be prepared."}
{"text":"So we fulfilled our Holiday Visiting Duties and during the trip hit up Ground Control again...and it's still awesome. This time they were sneaking songs off Fallout 3 onto the playlist. Heck yeah. I always need another coffee from here."}
{"text":"We stopped in early lunch on a Saturday morning.  I ordered the Chipotie Chicken with the reg fries while my wife ordered the Cali Pub chicken with the garlic parm fries.  I had a glass of the Sumatra Mountain Brown ale to go with my sandwich.  The sandwiches were good and there was no complaints about the service.  The food wouldn't draw me back, but the selection of beers on tap possibly could."}
{"text":"Had high hopes for this place. I was disappointed. Service was mediocre. Ordered the pesto pizza with chicken as recommended on the menu. Pizza dough tasted like floured cardboard. It needed salt and maybe less flour. No flavor. Pizza crust is usually a favorite for me, but not today. The chicken also tasted chewy like they boiled it and threw it on top. No seasoning. To make it worse it was cut into 1 inch cubes. I had to take the chicken pieces off and cut them into quarters and put it back on so I could actually eat the slice of pizza without choking on pieces of chicken. The bathrooms were also in disrepair. The ladies toilet literally wobbled and I'm not a large person. My husband said the men's toliet handle literally came right off when he went to flush it. Basically management needs to get on top of this place. Its in a great location and the overall theme is great. The execution is just way off the mark. Wouldn't go back without serious changes."}
{"text":"I was a little nervous because of the strange mix of recent good + bad reviews but we went for it with an open mind....boy, am I glad we went!!  The overall decor/ambiance was a bit eclectic but I don't mind at all; I would prefer that over \"cookie-cutter\" any day of the week.  I do love that Ground Control is owned by a (former - ?) military member/family as I love to support not only the local community but our military families, as well.  (Yes, they DO have Military Discount.)  When you first walk in, you see racks of wines on the right and a coffee counter/gelato bar on the left.  If you continue straight, you enter the dining room.  There seems to be plenty of seating inside plus additional seating outside.  Along the back wall is a large pizza oven, open pizza prep area and a bar with quite a number of beers on tap.  They also sell growlers, too.  We visited on a Sunday morning around 8:30am and easily found a seat.  Rob was our server.  Contrary to other reviews that bashed the service, we actually had very good service and Rob was quite attentive.  Rob brought us a coffee menu as well as a breakfast menu.  I had a Snickerdoodle cappuccino and my daughter had a Mayan Mocha cappuccino - both arrived with cute designs and were as delicious as you could imagine.  For breakfast, I had a Cabo burrito (oh my HELL it was amazing!!) with the most delicious spicy verde sauce on the side.  (I want to buy it by the barrel and BATHE in it.)  My daughter had the Geneva scramble and it, too, was delicious.  On a whim, we decided we had to also try the Bacon Pancake Sticks and...yowza...had I known how tasty their pancakes were (before you even bite into the bacon, mind you!) I would have seriously considered the pancakes.  (Bear in mind that I am on WeightWatchers and rarely order pancakes but I would scrimp and save my points to splurge on pancakes from Ground Control.). Lucky for me, I was able to discover two favorites for our next visit.  I truly hope that we continue to have the same type of experience that we had today - if so, you just gained some LOYAL, regular customers!!!"}
{"text":"I've been to the ground control ever since they were in located at Indian school rd. & Litchfield. This new location now is much more closer to my house which is nice. I've only try their chicken quesadilla to go and it was very delicious! It comes with 1 chipotle sauce, sour cream and a side of pico de gallo. The chipotle sauce was a lil bit spicy but I love it! Yesterday was a bummer, I didn't know that they're gonna have a private party so they were close from 5pm to 8pm so my friends and I relocated and ate dinner at Takamatsu, but we came back for dessert while still chitchatting. The amarena gelato is a must try. The customer service was great, the guy who helped us was nice & friendly."}
{"text":"This review is only for the beer selection and the fantastic, knowledgeable, and thoughtful staff at the back of this fine establishment.  My family and I decided to take a break from the MLB spring training and actually venture out from Surprise, AZ.  Great choice for a relaxing day out. I highly recommend sitting down at the bar and talking to Ian - very knowledgeable. He helps to select all the beer choices, so you will find what you like if you inquire.  Given the somewhat remote location, I was extremely happy with this pub."}
{"text":"To the owners of Ground Control:  please learn how to staff accordingly. 
I live on the east valley and come here for your amazing beer events. EVERY time I come your staff acts as though I am invisible. 10 minutes to greet a customer is completely unacceptable. I have on multiple occasions been completely ignored and forgotten about. You advertise all over Facebook for your Anniversary and that the special beers will be tapped at noon, but You only have 3 servers on the floor and no one behind the bar. Your resturant is full. 
Making your customers happy should be the priority, not the specialty beers that you get."}
{"text":"My mom and I decided to check this place out over the weekend before our manicures.  I was surprised to see it pretty empty on a Sunday morning.  I had the Spanish breakfast sandwich (without the Turkey) and a Mixed Berry Smoothie.  One major red flag was I ordered the super fruit smoothie, as she was bringing me the mixed berry she asked if it was alright because they were out of super fruit.  It was fine but I would to have liked a real option.  Both my sandwich and smoothie were delicious.  My mom had the Dutch and a french press which she raved about.  The reason I'm saying 3 stars is simple.  The place could use a face lift, the booths are trashed.  And service needs some major improvement.  We had been told the french press came with free refills but she never came back to refill the coffee which was gone before our food arrived.  If service was improved and the place got a little nip tuck this place would be 5 stars."}
{"text":"Great coffee.
My previous experience was amazing pizza and wine. Today was a disappointment.
The breakfast burrito was horrible. The potatoes were hard. Parts of the tortilla were cold. The cheese was shriveled up in one corner. I would guess that it wasn't made fresh despite the wait for it.
The Cubans was what I needed this chilly morning. I will continue to grab my drinks here and leave the burrito."}
{"text":"Ashley was my server and offered superb service! Awesome atmosphere, wood fire oven pizza, and really good gelato! My favorite is the cinnamon flavor."}
{"text":"Pizza, Beer,wine, cheese boards and gelato is fabulous.  Love that we have this kind of unique restarant on the westside."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place two reviews. One for the coffee bar in the front and one for the restaurant. I'll start with the good stuff. The coffee is awesome. I think it's their espresso machine. It doesn't have that burnt espresso taste like Starbucks. They even made the hot chocolate a little cooler for my daughter who would have totally burned her tongue by drinking it right away otherwise, cause that's what kids do. They have a punch card system where you get one free if you buy so many. Be prepared to wait in line if you come in the morning.
Now for the restaurant. It seems like something is always broken or falling apart. The first time I came it was the chairs in the booths. The tables are always wobbly, sometimes with folded up paper towel underneath to help it level, but that is usually failing. One time we went in dead of summer for lunch and they had the air off and the lights down low like they were trying to keep it cool with the darkness. No one mentioned anything about it. Our server did not say anything like, \"Sorry the air is broken,\" so it is hard to say if the air was broken or if they are trying to save money. You have to have the air on in the summer in Arizona.
The service is up in the air as to what you will get, but most of the time you have to wait a while to be acknowledged and once you do it is by someone trying very hard to be nice and work for that tip, but very clearly overworked. Plates and silverware have to be returned, sometimes multiply times because of being dirty. If the food is hot then it is good but that isn't always consistent. Very often the food comes out luke warm. I wish this place was better. It seems like a place that started out as a great, hipster, trendy, gastropub and then they ran out of money and have been trying to hold it together ever sense. I want to like this place but they just really need to invest a little in maintenance and employees. I really hope this place can turn around because I love to support local businesses like this. In the meantime you, at least, have my coffee money but I will not be returning to the restaurant."}
{"text":"Wine and prosecco was warm. Food fantastic. Server Nadine explained that the cooler wasn't sufficient to chill white wine or champagne and that the staff have asked the owner numerous times to store wine in another cooler. This is why places close."}
{"text":"Don't believe the negativity - this is a great place! I had coffee drinks and breakfast with the wife and kids on Saturday AM, and totally enjoyed the whole experience. The coffees were excellent, with art in the latte foam. Service was attentive, even with a steady stream of other patrons. The breakfast burritos we ordered were delicious, hot, and served quickly. The kitchen accommodated special requests from the kids without a problem. I don't live in the Phoenix west valley anymore, but I'd be a regular here if I did."}
{"text":"I went here after being treated rudely at another establishment. The breakfast burrito I had was excellent. My son loved his ham egg and cheese bagel. Melissa and everyone else we delt with at Ground Control understood what excellent customer service means. They have gained new Sunday morning customers."}
{"text":"This place is pretty cool. It's like a bar/restaurant/coffee shop/ Gelato place. I haven't been to the bar or the restaurant part but I have had their smoothies and the Gelato. 

First and foremost the staff is awesome. Two cool dudes working the coffee spot who make natural conversation with you. They ask you what you like and you answer. They give feedback lol. 

Their smoothies are quite tasty. My brother asked them to make a smoothie with coffee in it and hey they actually tried it. I didn't want to try it but I was told that it was good lol. As far as the Gelato. I don't even remember what it tastes like so I'm going to say that it wasn't that good...


Definitely want to try more of this place out."}
{"text":"Good food but service is bad.  Our waitress frowned the whole time and was short and rude everytime she spoke.  I would suggest skipping this place!"}
{"text":"Really really delicious coffee.  My wife and I were looking  for a late night caffeine rush, and came across this shop and they did not let us down."}
{"text":"Unique concept, Coffee Bar and Gelato available at the front counter, coffee was reasonably priced and pretty good. Of course they make all the specialty hot drinks as well, My friend enjoyed his latte. Behind the coffee bar is a \"seat yourself\" style bar/restaurant. I have now tried a oriental style salad (with mandarins) and a chicken pesto style sandwich. Both were good, but nothing exceptional. The restaurant has a decent selection of craft beer and wines, and follow the \"no crap on tap\" movement, refusing to have any of the big brand lite beers. 

I like this place because it is close enough to work to come on lunch break and can accommodate good sized parties. If I go back and something changes my rating I will provide updates. For now its a good 3 star spot, but not quite in the 4-star range."}
{"text":"A nice place for a cup of fresh coffee and muffin. Brea at the counter helped us and she's super sweet and friendly. Comfortable, warm place. We're here at 11:30 on a Monday. They stop serving breakfast at 11:00. 

One negative: chairs at front are very dirty."}
{"text":"Only fresh brew cup in the Phoenix West Valley.  I do not live as close to Ground Control Coffee Shop as I used to, but still worth the drive.  If you are a coffee drinker you will agree that fresh roast and fresh brew is amazing.  

I also like there huge selection of beers from around the world.  You can make a custom six pack by selecting 6 separate beers."}
{"text":"The first time the service was really good. We had the gentleman that we've noticed works in the center of the restaurant. The second time was with another server back in January. I can't remember the date, but it was a Friday night. I ordered the salmon and after waiting 27 minutes I was told that they had no mashed potatoes. I said to just give me a salad, no big deal. Not even 5 minutes later all of a sudden they had mashed potatoes. Interesting! During the whole time we waited for our food our waiter never came to our table until I waved him over to see what the deal was. 

   Last night, April 9th, was the 3rd and final time we will ever step foot in this place. I don't recommend this place at all. The service is HORRIBLE unless you get the guy that works in the center of the restaurant. Sorry, I didn't catch his name. The gal that we had was completely wrong for food service. She couldn't even tell a red wine from a white wine. The problem with that? I was told she was a bartender! Seriously???

   Not to mention after waiting over 30 minutes for our food, she came to ask us if we would like anything else while we were there? I said no and looked at her puzzled. I think she realized that she hadn't put our ticket in. She avoided our table the whole time and even after that moment. We waited another 12 minutes when she came back to ask if we would like dessert? I said no, still looking confused. We hadn't even had our dinner! After talking to my Husband he went up to her and asked for our bill. They actually made us pay for our drinks, which we hadn't finished because we were waiting to drink it with our food, and our appetizer. The waitress claimed that they were busy and that's why we didn't get our food. BTW... this place was only about 1/3 full. Busy? She had 3 tables?! 

   After paying for our food and leaving $0 for her tip we walked out. I turned back and went in demanding to see a manager. At no time did she ever bring it to the manager's attention. Completely unprofessional! They made us wait another 10 minutes as they searched for a business card and proceeded with the gift card. We were told that \"when\" we come back the manager would wait on us personally. I think not! We will never be back and I have spread the word on Facebook. A nice night out was ruined by an under trained waitress. Busy? LOL Yeah, not the case. No excuses for horrible service Ground Control!

  READ THE REVIEWS! If you want over priced food, horrible service, and a place that has no definition than this is the place for you. Any one want my gift card? I can't even give it away to any of my friends! 

   Last but not least, when do you serve wings with no ranch?"}
{"text":"I like to support local businesses and stay away from the overpriced chain eateries. I really like this place. The Cafe Roma is my favorite drink. It has dark chocolate, caramel & prailine. Sometimes I get it iced and then blended. The tea selection is great. I've also tried the gelato and enjoyed that as well. The breakfast sandwiches are also really good. The service is lacking at times, but I like the overall atmosphere and don't mind. This place doesn't have the rushed feeling, like other places do."}
{"text":"I had the triple double pizza here and it was great.  The sauce was bland though but the cheese and crumbled sausage was tasty.  They also have a great craft beer selection."}
{"text":"A Schneiders favorite in the west valley!! Great food, craft beer on tap, and gelato!!"}
{"text":"We used to go here alot more when they first open. They've changed things around a bit. Coffee is good depending on who makes it. Gelato is always great."}
{"text":"It's kind of rare to find a unique-ish coffee shop in the far west valley, but Ground Control is a nice spot. Their loose leaf tea selection is great (go for the jasmine), huge wine selection and some unique beers on tap. Try the Triple Karmeleit (sp?). They also roast coffee beans, although I haven't tried much of their coffee so I cannot comment. The decor is pretty contrived, but they try. And I also like that they often have student art from local high schools hanging on the walls. Support the community. The are moving to Camelback and Litchfield, I believe."}
{"text":"Good find for anyone living in the West Valley or just visitng. Quality is just as good if not better than Starbucks. Coffee is superb and the food is excellent. They even have gelato!

The one problem I have is with their service. They have a restaurant type service, which does not seem to work in their favor. When you sit down, it takes 15 minutes to be greeted and another 30 to get food. In order to avoid this is to order at the counter and then be seated. 

I recommend this place solely for the quality of their coffee and food"}
{"text":"This spot is a hidden gem! Coffee and gelato in the front and restaurant and bar in the back. Not crazy about the coffee and gelato but the food and craft beers are the best! My favorites are the cali pub sandwich and the pizza! Their beer selection alone will make you rethink ever going to another bar (Tripel Karmelite on tap, you're welcome)."}
{"text":"We visited again for lunch. The atmosphere is great. The biggest complaint: our food was sloooooow. Our waitress apologized several times. Fortunately, we weren't in a hurry and it was nice to just sit and talk.

I had the flatbread off the appetizer menu. It's large, the size of a pizza, and not that flat, really. I enjoyed the toppings and the chewy texture of the bread. It was quite dry, though, since it had no sauce and just chunks of cheese and tomato. I still enjoyed it. (At home, I heated up my leftovers, added salad greens, and a balsamic drizzle. The balsamic was awesome and fixed the dryness problem.)

My husband had the triple double pizza. To quote the menu: \"San Marzano tomatoes, hot & sweet sausage, red bell pepper, pepperoncini, mozzarella and monterey jack.\" To add to that: \"Pure deliciousness.\"  My husband loved it, and the few bites I had were awesome. It had the perfect kick to it. Plus, tons of cheese.

I'd come for lunch again if I wasn't in a hurry, but I don't think I'd get the flatbread again. Fortunately, there are a bunch of other things that look delicious--I was definitely eyeing the salad on my neighbor's table."}
{"text":"Yep, the service sucks. The entry multi-tasks as the coffee counter/storage area/waiting space for the restaurant and chances are if you are there to be seated, you will be ignored for at least a couple minutes, several if they're busy. Whoever is running the joint aggressively doesn't give a shit, because they've had these reviews for awhile and my two visits were spaced 6 months apart, and it's the exact same. Some of the servers seem sympathetic to the plight of customers, but they appear powerless to make a real difference.

Can't recommend the food. Ordered the Nosh Plate, which is advertised to include sopresatta. When my plate arrived sans-sopresatta, I had to show the waitress the menu to confirm it was indeed supposed to have sopresatta. She returned with meat so finely cubed that it looked like cat food in the bowl. Maybe that's how you put it on a pizza? It's not how you should serve it on a meat & cheese plate. Olives were without the pit, which makes me question their quality.

Garlic parmesan fries: lots of parmesan, very little garlic.

Beet salad and a burger: acceptable, but you don't get points for just acceptable.

Beers: they run out of them. A LOT. First visit, took three tries to find one. Second visit, two tries. They don't arrive to the table fast, either.

Growlers: they seal them with this little plastic band that's a bitch to remove. Very nitpicky, but this place makes me want to complain about everything.

No mas."}
{"text":"I love this place!  The beer, coffee and food are always phenomenal!  I come here every chance I get.  If you are looking for a place to get in and out of this is not the place for you.  The environment is suited for those looking for a nice morning/evening relaxing and shooting the shit with their friends or family.  I love everything about this place and I hate that it took me a year and a half of going here consistently to give it a review.  I hope you enjoy this place as much as I do."}
{"text":"So I am a cranky old man that never writes reviews, but feel compelled to write one. My wife and I are regular patrons of Ground Control and I could not have found a better place to recommend to friends and family. I know I am pickier than most when it comes to finding a beer that I like. This Gastro Pub has an ever changing list of beers that cater to anyone, Trust me, if I can find one I like ANYONE can! A special thanks to Nadine for putting up with me with her great advice in choosing awesome craft beers for me. Her personality is unbelievable! 

  I am dismayed at another yelpers comments about Val in the Coffee/Gelato Bar. She is a great addition to the store from the awesome smile and hello you get when you walk in, to the \"Thank you,have a good night\" when you leave. 
  
 For those who have yet to try the baked bri, the amazing pizzas and sandwiches or the tacos de calle, you are missing the best little dinner spot in the West Valley that not only have great foods and vast array of beers, but a staff that makes you feel like family!"}
{"text":"Went back to try and iced mocha once again. I figured the initial visit could have just been an off day. Plus I really wish a decent coffee shop was around that wasn't chain-besides Verrado which is a tad out of the way. Anyway my iced mocha was ok. Nothing good. Starbucks and Dutch Bros are way better. I really don't see how this place is in business, other than perhaps their restaurant and wine part makes the business. I wouldn't recommend or go back unless new management came along."}
{"text":"The concept is great, the execution is horrible. I went and bought my kids gelato. I thought I'd try a craft beer while they ate. I sat for about 30 minutes, and I had to stop a waitress to get a beer menu.  No one would take my order. Two different waitresses passed me more than 10 times each.  I tried to flag them down. The place wasn't even busy. Seems like the owner is a bit too distant from the processes in his shop. The place could turn around, but it won't with my business again."}
{"text":"Went in for the first time just to try their coffee. The was a gentleman with 2 children trying gelato flavors infront of us. We patiently waited for 10 minutes while the gentleman walked away and left his 2 kids to taste every gelato in the case. To top it off, the worker helping the kids never said a single word to us and other workers kept walking by just looking and not helping. Needless to say, we left and won't be returning."}
{"text":"This place was recommended by friends of ours and has always delivered unique and flavorful food.  The atmosphere is friendly and inviting!"}
{"text":"We have been here multiple times. The service is pretty terrible. There's literally one guy that is there every time who does nothing but talk to everyone else who are mostly trying to do their jobs. The beer for the most part is overpriced for a taproom, though it's good and diverse. Food is pretty good, but also pricier than what it should be for what it is."}
{"text":"Have been multiple times and little by little the service gets worse. When I first started going the servers would get to you quick, the food was made right away and was brought to the table hot and ready to eat. The last 3-4 times we have gone it has taken the waiters more than 10 minutes to come and ask for drink orders. There's been multiple occasions I've showed up in the morning to order breakfast and the cook decided not to show up to work that day. Great food, great drinks but the terrible service has made me never want to go again. It's unfortunate because I am a believer in helping local companies and restaurants but the service has become unbearable at this point."}
{"text":"An amazing list of wine and beer! The food and service was outstanding! If you need a friendly place with great customer service. The food will entertain any palate as well. 

If your in a hurry you can call your ordering ahead of time or stop by for some amazing coffee!

We will be back here in the near future!"}
{"text":"This Ground Control is amazing. Hannah is the best barista, she is so awesome and always makes the perfect drinks. She offers expansive knowledge on every creation that GC has to offer. Really great service and quality here."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good just took some time to come out, only thing I didn't like was that the waitress had no idea what she was talking about when it came to the different types of beer they had."}
{"text":"Wow what a fun discovery! This place has over 20 wonderful beers on tap at all times. The variety is amazing. With IPAs, Heffeweizens, porters, local, imported, and more. Love doing the sampler of 4 [or 8 :) ]
Food is a mesh of unique and comfort classics, pizza is cooked in a little brick oven. Always delicious!"}
{"text":"Food was good but service rather slow as the bartender was the only person covering the restaurant. He was a nice guy, just shouldn't of had to carry the load."}
{"text":"This place is somewhat schizophrenic, but I can't stay away. The decor is Austin Powers meets the Lilliputians. Once you get past the unkempt entry way-gelato bar- espresso station, you are confronted with vibrant orange trim, odd round booths, low slung tables with semicircular chairs all intersected with a long diagonal bench providing high top style seating. A slight hipster feel, interrupted by what some might see as politically incorrect (I find it awesome) throw back military art. Unique doesn't seem a strong enough word. 

They roast their own coffee which is top notch, make their own gelato, and have the most amazing wine and beer selections in the area. If you want a Bud Light, go somewhere else. But if you want an artisanal wine, or a Quadrupel beer (St. Bernadus) this IS the place for you. Just a fantastic selection of IPA. Weiss, Stout etc...Their motto is \"no crap on tap\".  Pair a nice brew with their fantastic garlic parmesan fries and just enjoy the eclectic music and environment. 

The menu is just like the decor, varied and maybe even odd. They have excellent, albeit limited, breakfast selections. The breakfast selections; breakfast burger, paninis, bagels and burritos are wonderful. They also boast crepes, scrambles and skillets which we have not tried as of yet.

Lunch: Burgers (Angus, hand made, juicy), salads, roast beef and turkey sandwiches, paninis, including the VIPR panini (Pastrami, havarti chive cheese, brown mustard). Then there is the wood fired pizza oven (Sopresseta pizza is my personal favorite).  I told you...unique. But everything is super tasty.

Dinner is really the lunch menu with sometimes nightly specials. Last night's special was pork chops with a berry compote, risotto, and asparagus. Since pork chops are not on their regular menu, this is not the \"take a dollar off of our normal menu price, and call it a special\" special. It is a no kidding. unique menu item.

So, the downside. They regularly run our of things, and occasionally substitute another item without warning (thought you were getting potatoes with your breakfast..ha!...here are some sliced strawberries and cantaloupe instead). The service can run slow, and management does not aggressively keep their staff moving. The place is just what it appears to be; a restaurant/gelato bar/coffee house/pizza joint/wine bar/brewhouse. A bit confused...but what do you expect when a fighter pilot opens a restaurant? I still can't stay away...."}
{"text":"We were very excited to try the new location in Verrado. It was Saturday afternoon around 3:45pm and besides the guy at the bar, we were the only customers there. Our waitress came over after we were seated and asked us if we wanted anything to drink without even giving us the drink menu.

 I was about to compliment her on her sparkly eyeshadow, but paused after she curtly replied they don't let customers taste a wine before ordering. She then served Mark's beer on the cool to room temperture side and my red cab wine very cold. Not good, even in the summer. 

When asked how the shrimp ceviche was, our waitress simply replied, \"I don't know, I've never had it.\" Well, this should have been a red flag, but we went ahead and ordered it anyway. The strawberry spinach salad was just okay, the mozzarella caprese was good, but not great, and the shrimp ceviche was downright rubbery and sour. Shortly after our waitress served us our food, I realized she still hadn't brought us the glasses of water we had asked for with our drinks and had to walk up to the bar and ask again.

 I guess what put us off the most on this very mediocre service was that instead of smiling and attending to her ONLY dining patrons, she was leaning against the bar watching the overhead TV. Definitely skip this Ground Control location and drive the extra length to the one on Litchfield Rd."}
{"text":"i was visiting a friend in phoenix and she suggested going here for dinner. she goes here a lot and said it was really good. she was right.
they have a decent beer selection and it's always changing. we all split a cheese board and park fries with aioli. both were good. i got a farmer's pizza (or something like i can't, i can't remember the exact name) which was also delicious. our server was super friendly as well.
my friend got gelato for dessert, which i tasted, and was so good. i'd definitely go back if i were in the area again. it's a cool place to just hang out as well, all the staff seemed really friendly and i really liked the atmosphere."}
{"text":"A gem in the west valley! great atmosphere and and live music. The coffee is always fresh and the food is tasty."}
{"text":"I had been there so many time and I always leave with the same feeling... That place could do better if the owner will care more :( The menu needs some improvement, there is always messy in the bar and the wine room area. Kids on a friday and saturday night? Its not comfortable to be drinking with a minor  next to you! The music isn't that bad but they need better band for the weekend...  The lighting should change at night time... I always go there because I want to support them but sometime its unpleasant to be there... the owners never smile and never said thank you for coming?   :("}
{"text":"Love this place. Food is consistent and I think really good. Wait staff is available but in no way try to hurry you. It's relaxing and comfortable. The burger, pizza and chicken sandwich are excellent choices."}
{"text":"I believe this place is on the verge of
shutting down. I went here the other night at 6:30 pm and the place was empty. I was
shocked because during my last visit about 4 months earlier the place was packed
at this prime dinner time. I also noticed that their giant chalkboard above the bar had zero beers listed or specials. Again, on our first visit this board was filled with special beers and other drink specials. We knew something was off. We decided on getting the Parmesan garlic fries appetizer since we remembered how good they were, but sadly they came out soggy and super greasy. I also ordered a pizza for my kids and an Asian chicken salad for myself. The pizza took forever but was decent, nothing special. My salad however, was
TERRIBLE. So terrible in fact, that for the first time in my life I sent it back to the kitchen (to be tossed). The chicken was clearly cooked way earlier then when I ordered it and it was as dry as jerky. No joke, chicken jerky dry. My hubby actually thought it was grilled pita bread croutons. It looked old and dry. (SEE MY PICTURE I UPLOADED). I showed the waiter and he instantly knew why I was complaining and gladly removed it from our check. By this time, my kids were done eating so I wasn't able to re-order an entire new entree nor did I want to after my horrible salad experience. So basically I had to go home and make myself dinner. It is sad that this place has obviously went downhill. We won't EVER return. Quality went to shit."}
{"text":"This resturant is so close to being great. Fantastic coffee, wonderful food, live entertainment in the evenings on Friday and Saturday but the service is horrible! I have had to leave twice because I could not get a coffee order in after 10 minutes with no people ordering drinks in front of me. I did enjoy the personal conversations of the 3 employees that held on personal conversations with eachother for that entire time and did not even acknowledge me. I have come into the resturant and sat down two times now and have not been acknowledged for over 20 minutes and the employees walk back and forth from the kitchen to the front of the resturant to the coffee area. I don't get it. I had to go to the front and ask if I had a server or how do I order both times and both times they say that I guess I could order with them. Really? Where do I order? How do I order? Do I have a server? I  keep coming back because the food and coffee are great hoping the service with get better but yet again I am disappointed."}
{"text":"So far I've only been here for the gelato and iced chai latte.  I'm totally hooked on both! So yummy! I recommend the nutter butter gelato, but all of the flavors I've tried are great, they make them in house. The staff has always been super friendly as well. Can't wait to go back and try the brick oven pizzas!"}
{"text":"Visiting from out of town and stumbled on this gem. Great beer selections (\"No crap on tap\"), wonderful appetizers and salads, and a killer half baked cookie with gelato. Yummy!"}
{"text":"For the money this is a great deal, huge scoops of housemade gelato, we had the straticello, amare, mint chocolate, nice with the different biscotti they sell to provide a nice crunch."}
{"text":"Cute little coffee place with wine, gelato, and some food items. I've only came here for a mocha Frap but enjoyed it every time."}
{"text":"This place is hit or miss. Some nights the service and food is great, and then some nights not so much. My husband and I came on a Tuesday night. We seated ourselves as directed, and a server gave us water. Then we waited about 20 minutes without further service and left. People who were seated after us received drinks and had their order taken. Not quite sure why we were ignored. Decidedly not coming back here again."}
{"text":"I stopped in for breakfast and coffee while on vacation as a recommendation from the 310th Fighter Squadron. Okay I just want to remain honest here. All of the food was excellent I will crave the Cabo burrito for months to come. Has to be one of the best breakfast burritos I've ever had, the short stack was also delicious. However the kitchen (in my opinion) should serve the pancakes and French toast with softened butter. Not cold hard pads in a ramekin. We also ordered a French press coffee and a Roma the Roma was wonderful and the French press delicious as well. Good Coffee, Good Food, I could even see this being my local bar. My only qualm has to be the lack luster service and responses, while none of the staff working the breakfast shift were rude they were undoubtedly still sleeping. Again, I'm not one to point fingers and I totally get it you may have even worked a close and had to open the next day... but our order was messed up, probably took longer than it had to and had nothing in the way of the \"I might as well do this my self attitude\" ... look maybe everyone was still recovering from the night prior but with the food and drink being as good as it was I hate to see the service ruin it. I hope to come back and smash a Cabo burrito with a Roma and see everyone awake and warmer."}
{"text":"The location still hasn't grown on me... but the old menu appears to be back (for the most part)!  The angus burger has lost its pretzel roll, but retained much of the admirable qualities that I remembered oh so fondly.  And every time I take a bite of the chicken sonoma quesadilla, I may let out a little loving moan - ahhhhh..."}
{"text":"We were treated horribly.. I will never attempt this place again. What started off as a mistake on their side with our \"reservation\" was only worsened by how poorly they not-even-half-heartedly attempted to resolve it."}
{"text":"The Brie with boisenberries and apple is delightful! Live music on Friday nights are always fun as well. The Staff is a little underhanded most times but the few that are there are very friendly. Pizza is great as well, a little under cooked but very tasty. I give it 4 out of 5. They definitely got something going on, and I will definitely be back. :)"}
{"text":"Usually a good selection of brew .. Mostly California and other West Coast breweries. Food above average.  
Service tonight was very good but I have been there when it's slow.
We'll be back."}
{"text":"I live in Chandler, so the ONLY negative thing I can say is that this place needs to be a lot closer to me! 

Had a great time here - I've seen them on Check Please! and have been wanting to eat here plus I knew about the amazing tap list from hearing from other beer nerds and was excited to try it out. This place does not disappoint. From coffee to gelato to wine and beer and great food - they have it all covered here! I tried a beer flight and loved getting to try some of the best taps around thanks to their awesome beer guy Ian. The food was really great too, I know my friends were all really happy with their selections as well. Next time I want to try some wines for wine night - it all looked really great!"}
{"text":"So wanted to like this place as there is not much happening for food or coffee in the west valley. Sadly, after several times of going and giving it the benefit of the doubt I have to give up. Service is bad, food is less than mediocre, coffee is mostly good but not good enough that it erases all else. I guess it's busy due to lack of competition."}
{"text":"The coffee was delicious. The food was tasty, but was borderline room temperature. Whoever named their pulled pork sandwich a Banh Mi should have their food card revoked for false advertising. The ambience is a little schizophrenic, and I would guess you can't hear yourself think when it gets busy. The service was possibly the worst I have ever received. The barista was friendly and knew his business, but my server took over 30 minutes to even acknowledge my existence. And that only happened because I finally got up to get my own menu. I have never felt so unwelcome in a restaurant. I will not be returning until I hear about some major overhauls for their FOH staff."}
{"text":"Great coffee served up, fairly quick.  I got a peppermint Mocha and Cafe Vienna.  The latter has cinnamon and honey.  Neither coffee drink was too sweet.  Thinking about the pizza....."}
{"text":"This is the second time I've been here. And it was the second time the person at the counter helped the person BEHIND me. And they never appologized.
The only reason they didn't get one star is because they have good tea. 
Since rudeness is not isolated, I won't be back."}
{"text":"Our experience was alright. My husband and I came here for some after dinner coffee, so ordering from the counter up front wasn't too confusing since it's right at the front. After ordering we asked the barista where to sit. Their set-up is a little confusing since it's also a restaurant it's hard to gauge whether the seating is also for the people purchasing the coffee. When we asked the question she seemed like she had never heard that question before and had to check whether we could sit and where. It was fine.

Their beer and wine list looks awesome and I would love to come back for some drinks. There was something about the place and ambiance that prevented me from feeling completely comfortable. There really isn't a theme to the place, it just feels like the place was kind of thrown together and not well thought out or too welcoming. I appreciated the server in our area. He only came to ask once whether we were ordering anything and after that he just let us be."}
{"text":"Food was excellent and beer were excellent and 4 star but poor service is the reason for the poor review. We had ordered a pizza and a burger of which the burger took over 30 minutes to be served. When it was served the waitress told us that the cook was just finishing up our pizza. Well when you are sitting in eyeshot of the damn pizza station and can see the cook in a mad dash to try to make the pizza aka hadn't even been started I get a little upset. Anyways I digress, waitress didn't even offer us anything in compensation for our wait, Im sure all a ploy to get you to drink more which whatever. Horrible service from waitress never checked on us other then when bringing us food, no napkins or utensils were offered and only took my plate for the burger after my wife's pizza was almost done (being eaten). Oh i was done with my plate when she served the pizza. Anyways good luck hope you have a much better experience then me and my wife, cheers."}
{"text":"I have been to Ground Control a few times and have had a good experience every time! I have read some of the other reviews talk about bad service... that was not my experience at all, my server's name was Ellen and she was great--very attentive and knowledgeable. For all of those that gave a bad review based on service, ask for Ellen as your server and I am sure you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I'm sorry but the service here is terrible!  And the food is mediocre. Been several times and every single time I am actively ignored for upwards of 10 minutes especially at the bar. The ONLY reason we keep going back is to fill our growlers with beer. In the coffee shop up front they keep all their supplies and back stock where everyone can see it. Very messy. I wouldn't waste my time or money here"}
{"text":"Great craft beer selection and wine list. The menu is diverse and offers tasty salads, juicy burgers and wood fired pizza. I have really enjoyed everything I've eaten at this hidden gem."}
{"text":"Low key, somewhat hidden. Neat environment. Food and beer are good. Upbeat staff who is familiar with their wine and menu. Will defiantly go back."}
{"text":"Great food. Crappy service.

We ordered. Then we checked out the coffee menu for forever, got coffees, drank the large coffees, searched through all the beer, went to the bathroom, and still waited for a long time to get our food! And we were the only ones there!! What takes so long?!

Every time I've been here I've waited for a long time. For drinks, food, and the check!

No thank you."}
{"text":"Great food. Amazing assortment of beers. Great service. Our waiter let our son change his meal after it was served because it was to spicy for him. Appreciate the extra, special service and the willingness to accommodate our request to change meals. Definitely on our top list of good restaurants."}
{"text":"I've made several return visits to Ground Control and things have turned around for the good.  I don't see the same youthful part-time blondes that spoiled things in the past, and I've noticed the whole bean offerings up front are stocked much better than in the past.

Looks like they're rotating some of the beer taps which is good for variety.  They always seem to have some high quality Belgian, German, or domestic craft beers that pair well with the panini sandwiches."}
{"text":"Attended a networking mixer here.  The venue was perfect for the group and we milled about in a room that was filled exclusively by the guests, while others sat at the L-Shaped bar.  It's the first coffee house where I actually felt like lingering as long as humanly possible, with its low lighting & swank decor.  Everyone enjoyed the varieties of wine, desserts & staff hospitality.  Now, if only they had another one closer to the Surprise folks!"}
{"text":"A friend and I agreed to meet here a couple weeks ago.  I got there first.  After standing there for several minutes with several servers whizzing by and still not being greeted a frazzled server came up to me and sort of greeted me.  I said I needed a table for two.  She looked distressed and said several people had called in sick and there was a \"wait-list.\"  I looked around and there were several empty tables and booths.  I asked if I could sit in one of the booths and wait for my friend.  I knew we were going to stay for awhile and order wine and appetizers so I asked if I could sit in a nice booth.  I was told \"No, there is a wait.\"  At this point I thought about leaving not feeling welcome at all. My friend arrived and again we asked if we could sit in a booth, this time talking to the manager who said  \"No we are keeping it for parties of 4.\" I looked at the booth right next to it which had a party of two.  We were shown to a small little table and as I sat down I noticed the vinyl was all cracked with tape on it.  We were next to baby hi-chairs and the servers kept bumping into them and slamming things loudly.  The table was very wobbly and very close to other patrons. We ordered wine and as the booth was still empty we again requested to sit there.  This time we were told it was reserved!  I really wanted to leave but wine arrived so we reluctantly stayed.  We ordered a chicken quesadilla which was so-so with gray chicken.  At this point our server said now we could move to the booth we wanted all along!  We did and my friend ordered a salad which was average.  There were flies everywhere.  The only good thing was the wine!  Never again...mediocre food and poor management."}
{"text":"-This review is in regards for the bar staff and beer selection-

Best beer selection in the West Valley! You can always bet that there will be something new on tap for you to try. The bar staff is awesome and the beer events are great too!"}
{"text":"I'll Start with this is one best coffee shops in the west valley, and they have a really good beer selection. They had have a really good beer selection. One of the best beer selections for a local place. But what kills this place has no customer service. It is awful. You can go behind the counter and make your coffee. It took them 19 minutes to make my chia tea and I was the only one in line. I would avoid this place unless you want to go put your own."}
{"text":"To me, it's just ok.  I have tried the burrito, a blended ice chai.  Also the margarrita pizza.  Nothing I would go outta my way for.  Also had a different smell inside that I couldn't identify."}
{"text":"modern day cheers type place.  it's safe, clean, the staff is wonderful.  I hate beer but love wine and cocktails. the menu is simple and the food is fresh.  the beer selections are beyond me but I trust their saying \"no crap on tap\"  everything looks to be a micro brew or local brew.
my fave dish...baked brie....no, wait...the quesadilla, no wait....the burger....or the artisan cheese platter....the pizza?  I can't honestly decide.
I have met some really nice people here, regulars, and I can't get over how welcoming the staff are.
go to place for sure.

Ian is the man!"}
{"text":"First time here and definitely not the last. This place has everything you could want. Great coffee, solid food, and an amazing selection of craft beers. It's hard to find places like this on the West side. So excited to come back and enjoy all Ground Control has to offer!"}
