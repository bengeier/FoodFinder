{"text":"I wanted to love this place.  Really, I did.  It is so close to home, I was hoping it would be a \"go-to\" place for my hubs and me.  Not so much.  The interior is lovely.  The water feature is really cool.  I love the tile.  I hope to find it for a backsplash in my kitchen.  Yes, those are the thoughts that were going through my head as my uninspired meal arrived.  The berry mojito was good.  The wine list is nice and reasonably priced.  The service was.... weird.  Maybe because we were one of only three tables in there on a Saturday night but, we felt like we were being stalked.  Seaweed salad-- great.  Hard to really mess this up.  House salad with ginger dressing-- ok, here is where I show my odd palate-- I prefer iceberg with my ginger dressing, not field greens.  But, field greens are fancier, so field greens is what I got.  Fine (no stars taken off for this).  The rolls-- spicy tuna, a special roll, and a few slabs of shashimi.  All ok.  Not wowwonderful. Not even, wow! And pricey. And small (which I prefer, but my hub was disappointed).  I get that I am paying for atmosphere, too.  BUT, there was NO ONE there, which felt a little creepy.  Or sad.  Even our server seemed sad.  The atmosphere, lovely water feature aside, was odd.    3.5 but I rounded down."}
{"text":"Came here for my birthday, had reservations and everything. Food was okay. My boyfriend seem to like his meal, KungPoa shrimp. Mine was alright, curry chicken which didn't woah me. Sushi was also pretty good. Overall for the food it was pretty good. I must say, very expensive sushi, meals, and drinks. Overall it was about 80 something dollars. +automatic tip + taxes. I believe my boyfriend said he spent $120 that night.   One thing that got me upset was the fact that my table of people received all their food while I was the ONLY ONE that didn't received my meal. I just sat there drooling over everyone's food. I raised my hand for them to come and before I asked her anything she replied \"Ma'am, they miss counted so It's coming\". I told her alright because I didn't want my night to be ruined because it just started. But why wasn't I notified that there was a miss count and that I'll have to wait for my food? Why did I have to ask? How RUDE was that? They knew I was the birthday girl and didn't bother to tell me. The service there   Second, my boyfriend who paid for the meals didn't tip the waitress because automatically the tip was charged from his card. The waitress decided to get a little attitude when he came back asking if he'd left his card around here. She rudely said \"No. Go see the manager for it.\" The manager gave him his card back. What I hate the most is when waitress and waiters expect tip. I understand they work hard but your job is because you would love to serve us. If I see youre just hungry for money and act all ignorant towards me I will not tip you well.  Third, my friend had told me a waitress at AZN lied to her saying that the restaurant was suppose to close at 9:30pm. I had reservations at 8pm and I even double checked on the website to make sure I wasn't going to mess with their closing time. Officially, they close 10pm. For some reason the waitress lied to my friend that they were closing soon and they were just waiting for us. Although they said it was fine and they'll just wait... I thought it was weird when I found out they had said this to my friend. They were trying to rush us and faking it out on a smile. They made it seem as if they didn't want us there.  If I wanted to waste more money and deal with weird service I'll keep coming. But unfortunately, I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"I visited AZN during restaurant week in January with a group of girls. It was my first time there and I really enjoyed it. I got the calamari appetizer, the honey walnut shrimp, and the dessert (one choice- like a Chinese canoli with cheesecake filling yum!) Overall, the food quality and size of dish was excellent and I enjoyed each course I ordered. The server was very accommodating and the floor manager come over and checked on us at the end which was nice.  This restaurant is large and well decorated inside. Parking was easy just behind the building in a long narrow lot. I will be returning!"}
{"text":"This is our second time here tonight. We had our 5 & 9 y/o children with us the first time on Sunday early dinner time.  Both our children enjoyed the food.  We had sushi and asked for the rolls to be flash fried. It turned out better than we had expected.  Chilean Sea bass was pretty good too. Tonight, it was just the two of us having dinner.  We ordered the  Chef's Lobster special 3 course meal.  The first course was lobster and seafood Tom Yum soup. This soup was very savory, not too spicy and lobster broth cooked just right. Second dish was the lobster rolls with deep fried lobster claws. The rolls were pretty big and you can see huge chunks of lobsters rolled up. The portion size was just right for 2 people.  We both appreciate the sweet lobster meat in the deep fried claws.  We were full by the time the 3rd dish made it's way to our table. I could resist the ginger scallion lobster dish.  Having made the dish in my new England years, this final dish was a must - take - home .  Our waiter was extremely pleasant.  He observe when our glass needed to be filled and brought another refill when needed. The manager also made sure to check in with us. Looking forward to our next trip there."}
{"text":"Really enjoy this place. The variety of food they offer is great. I thought it was just going to be another sushi place. While the sushi they have is great, so are the fusion dishes I've tried.  The Korean short ribs are out of this world.  I just saw an article about how Korean food is becoming more popular and I can see why.   And don't miss out on the desert, which is a Fuji apple (some of the biggest I've ever seen), dipped in caramel, chocolate and some other good stuff.  First time I had one was during Halloween season.  I went home and threw out my caramel apples I made the day before because they were too inferior."}
{"text":"First of all, let me say that the food was actually pretty good. Not overly priced and better than what I expected. The service on the other hand, was horrendous. Our waiter took 10 minutes to even take our order. I would completely understand this on a busy night, but there were maybe 4 other tables filled in the restaurant. For a Saturday night, that doesn't say much for the viability of this place. When he finally did take our appetizer order, it took him another 15 minutes to come back and take our dinner order. The food did come out hot and within a reasonable timeframe, but we were never asked if we wanted to order another glass of wine or if we needed refills on our waters. To top it off, while I was still eating, the waiter literally took the plate out from under my chopsticks to put it in a box! While I hope this place survives, the service needs to be stepped up to even compete with any other restaurant in Southpark. What a dissapointment!"}
{"text":"I have been twice and neither time disappointed. The atmosphere is nice for business or date night. I love the bento boxes and feel they are a good value."}
{"text":"Went 2 this place about a mnth ago..really enjoyed the atmosphere,food & drinks ($5 martinis) ..awesome staff..I will b back when the weather warms up 2 Njoy the open patio!!"}
{"text":"Food was delicious and service was terrific.  I wish I got our server's name. She was attentive,  timely, and always smiling.  I had the cerviche,  which was excellent.  My wife's noodle dish was great - I know, I ate a lot of it. I recommend this restaurant.  Always pleased."}
{"text":"AZN is a stunning restaurant with an ambience that is welcoming and elegant.  We dined al fresco and ordered a variety of items from the ample  menu. Each of our dishes was perfectly prepared and presented and delicious!   Our server was thorough, the right mix of friendly and efficient and very pleasant.   The portions were ample and each dish was a palate pleaser. I loved  the  friend shrimp dish and the special babyback ribs. Our sushi was excellent (I live in San Francisco: a sushi town).   One of the big pluses is that you ine in a setting where you can hear your companions and never have to yell to be heard.     If I lived in Charlotte, I'd eat at  AZN  every opportunity I had and  it will be  Stop #1 when I return."}
{"text":"I took my daughter there for her birthday back on February 15th...I thought it would be a great place to try. She and her friends love asian food, as they are asian. The restaurant was very pretty and had a nice ambiance.  But, it took forever to get our food.  Also when we did get it, its was not good at all. I ordered the General tso chicken, very dry. My daughter had the pad thai noodles, she could not eat her dish. She never ever leaves her food. They need some better cooks or its a wrap. Will not be going back."}
{"text":"Very good location for a business networking meeting. Seating for 25 all with individual checks was not a problem! Excellent service; very good food. The evening was a success. Thank you Mr. L. for helping to make our evening a success on 1/14.."}
{"text":"I'm surprised more people haven't heard of this place! My best friend and I love coming here for lunch or a nice dinner. The atmosphere is nice and the interior is beautiful. The water along the wall is a nice touch. The servers are always pleasant, as well. On our most recent visit, Chris was our waiter and he was great. Very knowledgable, friendly, and we really enjoyed the conversation. I have also met the owner, Ana, and she is so welcoming and friendly. That is always a huge plus imo.  As for the food, the lettuce wraps are so good. I often come just because I'm craving that! I have tried several sushi rolls and my favorite is split between the Firecracker roll and the Volcano roll. On our last visit, my friend ordered Ana's soup. I'm personally not a huge fan of soup, but this is an exception.. It is nice and spicy, and full of scallops, shrimps, and noodles. It comes in a big bowl, so this will definitely fill you up, too.  Overall, this is definitely a local favorite for me. I highly recommend others try it and get the word out."}
{"text":"Prices are way too high to justify the food costs. Lightning is too bright and the restaurant is dead. The location kills them. We were the only ones there Friday at 7 PM.   Food is very, very average. Paying $18 for 8 rolls is really absurd. Go to Cowfish or Nikko's for sushi, Baoding for Chinese. This fusion \"do it all\" falls very short.  Service was good, you can tell they are trying to make an impression, but my guess is this stays open less than a year."}
{"text":"So we finally went there for lunch today.  The decor and everything was really nice, the bar area was big, a lot of dining space and a sushi bar.  They also have an upsairs but the staircase looked to be under consturction still.    I'm going to go ahead and get right to the food though.  The main conclusion....we're still hungry.  We got the bento box which came with a dish, rice, spring roll, and salad.  The dressing on the salad was really good, and I did enjoy the spring roll.  I got the Thai Basil Chicken.  It looked really good and it wasn't bad but it didn't taste like thai chicken to me.  I don't know if it's cause they used a soy garlic sauce but when I think of thai I think of a sauce with coconut milk.  It could have been much better.  No, it should have been much better.  My friend also got a bento box.  She go the General Tzu's Chicken but with brown rice, which also has a $1 extra charge for, as well as fried rice.  Well....we don't think the rice was actually brown.  It looks like white rice that was turned brown and fried with eggs.  She even asked the waiter to make sure it was actually brown rice and he said yes.  Definitely not a healthy option if that's what you're looking for so don't bother with it.  It's a waste of the $1.  But that's not it, the chicken was just not good.  It was so bland and flavorless and quite disappointing.  It probably ruined the whole box experience.  I don't think she was very happy with her meal at all.  From their menu it looks like AZN is trying to get a decent mix of different Asian styles on their menu.  But most of what we had really lacked in flavor and that's what makes Asian food so great.  So if you want reasonably priced Chinese food that's still really good, you're better off going to Baoding.  And to get much better Thai food, go to Deejai Thai.  Both much better and highly recommended options.  I was hoping this place would be great, mainly because of it's convenience but honestly I'm not sure if I want to go back any time soon.  I know it's still new and they probably have a few kinks to work out so I'm not ruling it out completely.  And I am still curious about their sushi so I'll be going back.  I'm just not in a rush."}
{"text":"My boyfriend surprised me tonight by arranging everything for my birthday. We got the tables upstairs for group of around 10 people. We first started off with 13 appetizers and they were really good. My favorites were the mangolian tacos, the calamari (I don't even like calamari!), and the bacon wrapped scallops (it only came in 3 pieces which was obviously not enough). For my entree I had the broth noodle dish, spicy Anna something noodle, I don't remember, it was really good. I'm really picky when it comes to Asian broth noodle dishes since I am Korean myself, but the broth was on point with nice kick to it. Unfortunately I couldn't finish it because I was too busy eating 13 appetizers AND the pecking duck so I got full pretty fast. I felt really bad for the waiter who served us that had to pack all 10 entree cause clearly my friends were just about to explode. The service was great, I wish I could remember his name but I don't know but if you are reading this, you were awesome. The manager(?), Steven was very cool. He took photos for us. We stayed there for a while after closing but he made us feel like we were at home! Anyway we will DEFINITELY be back. Thanks AZN staff!"}
{"text":"These guys do such a superb job in service, selection, ambiance and food quality I wish they had a 5+ stars, 'cuz they really go the extra mile in all areas. I've eaten there several times but wanted to wait until I'd had several meals before I rated them, since they are a new restaurant. We recently had a table of 7 to celebrate a family event and the attentiveness to our every need, plus the attention to detail, was impeccable. They made us feel special from the time we walked in until the time we left and cared for our needs without being 'too much' in our midst. Everyone LOVED what was ordered and the wine selection is ideal to go with the flavors. It's not inexpensive but the meals justify the cost without a doubt. So thrilled these guys have joined the new offerings around Southpark!"}
{"text":"First time here and we were very happy with the food. The shrimp app. was very good! My husbands beef rib dish was excellent! My basil tofu was pretty alright and the fried cheesecake was interesting. We will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Worst bartenders I've ever encountered! My husband and I sat at the bar for some sake while we waited for our table this past weekend, Valentine's Day. I asked the bartender for a sake/ drink menu. He went around looking for it for a good 5 minutes and never came back to tell us he couldn't find a menu or to simply tell us what sakes they had. He proceeded to wait on other patrons at the bar, stood right in front of us and ignored us. I gave him some time to see what he would do. Nothing. He waited on other people at the bar and ignored us while we sat drinkless. 15 minutes at this point with no drink. I was astounded. They weren't even that busy as it was later in the evening. My husband stopped him and asked bluntly if he found the menu. He didn't of course and finally showed us what they had. We had to prompt this bartender to serve us. We drank our Nigori and asked another bartender for our check when our table was ready. We waited another 5 minutes. That bartender cashed out another couple but not ours. Our bartender finally got around to us when I told him our table was ready and we needed to cash out. We have never left a zero tip before but we did. These bartenders did not serve us. They were unbelievably rude.   The only saving grace of this place is the food and the wonderful waiter we had once we got seated. He was on point and caring of our experience. My sushi roll was one of the best I've ever had.   0 stars for the bar, 5 stars for the food and table service."}
{"text":"My friend and I tried AZN during Charlotte Restaurant Week. It was a bit alarming that such a massive restaurant in an ideal location was almost completely empty, maybe 2 tables were seated in total. We ordered calamari as a starter, but it was brought out at room tempature and overlooked. It should never have been served. We informed our waitress who swiftly removed the plate, apologized, and brought us an alternative option. Looking at the normal menu it's obvious that this food is over priced....$18-22 for one sushi roll? I think not. There are way to many amazing little gem restaurants in Charlotte for me to pay inflated pricing for a subpar product at this restaurant."}
{"text":"Sea bass was exceptional! Everyone at the table raved about their meals (curry shrimp, Korean ribs, Mt. Fuji roll). I will definitely return!!"}
{"text":"Another great meal at AZN. Wonderful ambience, great sushi, impeccable service. Beautiful decorations for the holidays."}
{"text":"AZN opened earlier in the week but quietly.  It is located in the back end of Piedmont Center in South Park (across from the YMCA) Really like the look inside.  Comfortable and not overly stamped Asian Cuisine.  We were seated promptly and had exceptional service throughout our meal.  IF they had a learning curve, they didn't show it, or everyone in there are true pros. I will always shy away from Sushi on my first visit to a restaurant.  You do not need to do this here.  They have a serious Sushi set up and it all looked amazing. The menu is deep and interesting.  There are several Asian twist on your usual suspects.  Example, and what I had was 2 Tenderloin medallions (4oz each), vegetable montage, mashed potatoes and this sauce.... oh my... a black pepper butter cream.  That sauce will get me back again and again. The wine menu is fun and that is hard to say in a restaurant saturated South Park. If you do nothing... go and have their apple dessert.  First off it is smart, and then it is delicious.  It is possibly one of the more clever desserts I have had and well worth the trip. Pricing is fair. I would only give a 5th star if I go back and it still rocks it.  Consistency will get the 5th."}
{"text":"I ordered the General Tzu lunch.  It was my first time there and I really just got it expecting it to taste like some favorite fast food Chinese takeout. I mean how many different ways can you cook general tso?  I was wrong. It was delicious. I clearly did not know how General 'tzu' was supposed to taste before. I will definitely go back and be more adventurous and try the other menu items."}
{"text":"Being kidless, I decided to sit at the bar.  Even though I was there to try the sushi, I just couldn't pass up the vegetable dumplings, which was a good move on my part.  The dumplings were pan sauteed and delicious.  Best part of the meal.    For the sushi, I ordered a volcano roll, which is a california roll with a baked spicy mix with lots of mayo on top.  I'm not a fan of too much mayo on my sushi so I wasn't crazy about it, but it might just be my personal taste.  I've heard the food is better than the sushi here and based on the dumpling, I can see that may be true.  I need to head back sometime to eat off the regular menu.  They do get extra points for some eye candy on site.  My bartender was adorable.  If I could have ordered him I would.  I will return for that reason alone.  :)"}
{"text":"A to the Z to the N We were not impressed completely with this restaurant during restaurant week. It was the last day of restaurant week and we wanted to try anything available and this place was available and we LOVE Asian food from sushi to rices. The server was not knowledgable enough in the sushi area because she said the crab was REAL and the RESULTS ARE IN. This is a LIE 99.99% FALSE First Course: Sushi Appetizer and Shrimp app. The sushi app was tasty though it contained imitation crab which I just can't deal with. The shrimp were shrimp Main Course: The walnut shrimp is what I tried and my hubby got the duck. My dish could've been AMAZING if they held back on the sauce it was EXTREME and took away from the plate which isn't good to do as the entire plate should be memorable in some way. I guess it was, memorably OVER SAUCED .  Dessert; Fried Banana and berry egg rolls which were ok. The ones at P.F Changs are way better.  This is not my choice restaurants for Asian eats but was a good try/discovery."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a bit overpriced and the food was just okay - no complaints but nothing to write home about. The AZN Crab Cake was fresh but overpriced for the size. The Mongolian Beef Satay and Pork Dumplings were really good, and were priced great. The Shinjuku Tempura Sampler was decent, was missing the sweet potato though. The Spicy Anna Noodle Soup was delicious, and very spicy! The atmosphere and decor of this restaurant is also really nice, so I'm unsure why on a Friday night it was almost empty. The service was just okay and they only had one Yuengling beer, again on a Friday night. Overall it was a nice dinner with decent service but probably won't be returning because of the prices."}
{"text":"I met a girlfriend here for happy hour and drinks. When I arrived the place was pretty empty.  I was greeted right away and service was great!   We ordered a glass of Reisling with the Vietnamese spring rolls, Samba edamame, and Mandalay Crab Angels.   Vietnamese Spring Rolls: Best dish of the night! The were crispy and packed chicken chicken and veggies and the dipping sauce was fantastic. Just enough sweet to compliment the rolls without ruining the taste.   Spicy Edamame: Meh, it was just okay. I appreciate the effort with the chili-sesame oil. But I missed the \"spicy\" kick I was hoping for!   Mandalay Crab Angels: They were supposed to be crab and cream cheese wontons. However, all we tasted was globs of cream cheese. Where's the crab? Not a fan.   For me, everything was just okay. My biggest gripe is their prices. For the prices listed on the menu the portion sizes need to be MUCH larger.   I'll visit again to give their sushi a try...but definitely only on a Sunday evening because it's half off!"}
{"text":"Nice decor, great service, very very mediocre sushi. Sashimi was OK but all of the rolls, from basic to specialty, were very muddled. Many other sushi options in CLT for WAY less $$$."}
{"text":"best sushi in town.  a little pricy but worth it"}
{"text":"Found AZN on Open Table for an all you can eat brunch for $25.95 pp and figured, why not?  We were pleasantly surprised by the selection of food from sushi to blueberry pancakes.  It wasn't too crowded so the service was good and very attentive.  My only qualm was that they were a little slow in getting the sushi out, people ate that up super quick!  The waiter let us know they do half price sushi on Sunday nights, so we're going to definitely check it out again on a regular day to see how their normal service is."}
{"text":"Wow. I have to say that I was absolutely shocked at how good AZN was. Made it in for lunch, somewhat late in the afternoon, and there were only a few tables filled. We were a little leery of what was to come, but I couldn't not give this place 5 stars after our experience. It's pretty rare to have an experience that really delivers on all fronts, but AZN pulled it off. Even on a slower afternoon.   Started with miso soup, house salad with ginger dressing, and some of the veggie dumplings. Miso and house salad are pretty standard. Just right. The veggie dumplings were just great. So simple, a great combo of sauteed veggies and a fantastic ponzu/soy sauce for dipping. We actually ended up ordering a second order (which never happens to us). We were pretty hungry.   I ordered two rolls of sushi. Really simple -- California and Spicy Tuna. Both were fantastically easy and familiar. The presentation was hilariously cool. On a plastic bridge with some art made of sriracha. Check out my photo.   We ended up ordering dessert, too. (Again something that doesn't happen often) and it was nice. Tempura Cheescake. Pretty much what you would expect. How could you say you don't like fried cheesecake? I don't know either.   Ended up coming in again for lunch soon after and got to sample a menagerie of other menu items. Started out with the Firecracker and Enter The Dragon rolls. Both are much more complex, but incredibly flavorful. The Firecracker was by far my favorite. It's pretty pricey, but well worth it on occasion. Sashimi isn't something I'd typically order, but AZN's sashimi sampler packs a punch. Amazing cuts of Tuna, Salmon and Yellowtail. Love the arrangements and a nice bonus of a Cali Roll, too. The ceviche was great, too. Light, citrusy, and a mixed with a healthy portion of veggies.   The decor isn't overbearing. Not over the top like some other sushi places I've been to. I think what I love the most is the seating choices. Booths, bar, hightop, tabls, upstairs, sushi bar, private dining area. So much space and really gives you options for each visit.   Service is very professional and attentive. Each server I've had was polite and incredibly patient. Big plus.   Definitely my go-to for sushi when in Southpark."}
{"text":"Nice up market place. Good was pretty good. The stone grilled beef starter was nice. The fish dishes were very well prepared.  Service was ok. They took their time bringing out the main course. But we didn't mind as we came to chill out anyway.  Was very quiet on a Saturday night. Would have expected a little more of a livelier atmosphere.  Worth going."}
{"text":"We just left AZN on a quiet Monday night.   Our server, Maria was so helpful in her guidance of the menu.  Despite our 9pm arrival time, she and Stephen were not disturbed at all.  The kitchen created four excellent dishes that demonstrated beautiful artistry on top of great product - fresh and nice cuts of meat/fish, frest veggies, etc. (red dragon shrimp, stone cooked beef special, black and blue tuna and a clean, fresh roll).  We truly were impressed and cannot wait to return, especially in the spring/summer when we can enjoy the great patio area they've created."}
{"text":"Hidden gem. Sushi, Chinese and Thai dishes in a posh atmosphere. Super friendly staff.   Great chicken curry with steam rice. Really good sushi. Very dedicated to service - they really give personal attention to each person and seem really happy that you came in.  I really liked the AZN lo-mein and the house fried rice too.  Never over crowded or loud - intimate bar, good drinks."}
{"text":"Food is good and could have been better if service was better, ordered bento box but server forgot utensils and then the miso soup that comes with it. It feels they are in a hurry to get you out of the place. Never coming back again . Rusan's at park road is way better sushi and service."}
{"text":"We had a private group dinner on a Thursday night. The owner was very attentive and great fun! We had a mix of several apps and entrees as well as desserts. Everything was excellent. The steak and lobster was probably the best. The walnut shrimp was probably my second fav. The firecracker shrimp app was excellent!! The Fuji Apple with homemade chocolate sauce and pecans for dessert was a knock out. I would def go back here!"}
{"text":"This is a solid asian restaurant.  Food has always been excellent--I normally get the shrimp with walnuts and mayo sauce (I ask for sauce on the side and dip the shrimp into the sauce), and my husband always gets a beef dish of some sort.  It has never been very crowded, and based on the food, ambiance, waitstaff, it should be very busy.  Charlotte is lucky to have such a good asian restaurant, but for some reason, it's never packed  (and I think the reason is that people don't know AZN is where it is because of complete lack of visible signage--Brio's, George's, Del Frisco in the front where most people enter the development off of Fairview, and AZN at the complete end past the parking structures and across from the mini-YMCA).  I am hoping that once the new apartments/condos are finished and rented, AZN will be crazy busy because I would hate to see this restaurant ever close."}
{"text":"Decor is attractive and upscale with a large bar for waiting if crowded or just stopping in for a drink. My mojito (traditional not the specialty Berry) was just OK -- I would not  order again, far too bland -- little mint or liquor taste. Food was fine.. nothing extraordinary. Edamame (plain not spicy) was excellent, shrimp dumplings appetizer (4), OK, Chicken satay (4 sticks) rather flavorless unless dipped in the peanut sauce. Tuna/avocado roll decent but a small roll not large in diameter. Curry was more \"soupy\" than dry -- decent flavor but consistency was not the same as in Asia.  Restaurant was half full but noise level was far too high to have easy conversation at our table... a growing problem with new restaurants. ADD SOME SOUND SOFTENING!! I miss one of  my favorite dishes Singapore Noodles, which should be on every Pan Asia menu... spicy, curry flavor, w/ chicken and shrimp... suggest the restaurant add. This is more of an upscale restaurant with prices to match, but portions are large -- I still like Fujo's uptown -- very casual but excellent sushi and pan asia dishes."}
{"text":"Definitely a place to visually impress your guests! It's in a perfect location, the decor is fantastic, and the space is ready for a giant party! There were three things I was impressed with: the patio, the bathroom, and the water feature wall. The patio is spacious and welcoming right off of Piedmont Row. The women's bathroom had two stalls, but was well decorated and lit and they have seat liners as bonus. Last, the water feature was nicely done. I can't say enough about the ambiance and decor!  Now to the food. The sushi was good and comes at an elevated price than their competitors. My husband ordered the bento box and I ordered the lo mien and we both left unsatisfied. The taste was bland, unless you're a fan of oil being the main flavor that stands out. I'm not trying to be harsh, but as we were talking about our experience we both said it reminded us of frozen dinner Chinese because of the overwhelming sense of oil. I would have expected such a beautiful place to be as particular on their cuisine and entrees as the detail they put into the establishment itself. I was hoping for hints of ginger, garlic, and Asian spices, but instead it seemed to lack all of the above. In addition, like a previous reviewer, my husband left hungry. For a lunch price near $40, I wanted and expected better. Poprocks' photos definitely make the food, especially sushi, look incredible!  The server was nice and attentive. They do offer free WiFi for those who eat and work, just ask your server for the password.   For those of you who want to try the place for yourself, but at a less costly price, they offer happy hour on select items during mid-day and at the last hour of the night. However, you'll need to sit at the bar mainly (or depending on which time, you can sit on the patio)."}
{"text":"We went here last night and arrived right as the thunder snow started in FULL force!! The staff was amazingly nice and the owner came over and talked to us multiple times, chit chatting, and joking around about how we brought the storm.  He was amazing, and the interior of this place is amazing as well. Very well done!!   We started with the pork dumplings and they were really good, some of the best I've had in Charlotte and I've definitely never had them with so much filling in them!  It was  and early dinner so we skipped on the drinks but their list looked like a good one. Then I couldn't decide between the 7 flavor basil beef and the szechuan string beans with chicken. Luckily for me Ved doesn't mind getting one of the dishes I want and sharing when we go out :-)  Now I love green beans, seriously I order them whenever I can and these were soooo good!! The chicken was good too but I was focused on the green beans lol.  I had actually however ordered the beef dish and while it was delicious, the spices were fantastic and I love basil, I was definitely focused on the green beans so Ved traded dishes with me lol.  I think I didn't like the peanuts on the beef dish and that was my only miss. The rice was well cooked but I barely ate any of it as the dishes stood on their own perfectly.    Needless to say I will be back again and soon!! Will have to try the highly recommended duck and maybe some of their sushi.  My usual fav sushi place is just around the corner but their food isn't as good, so I would love to find a new Asian spot.  As we left the owner was chatting with us again and followed us out joking about the snow and be careful have a great night.  Seriously it was like meeting an old friend for dinner. Actually all of the staff was like that.   I suggest everyone come here and give it a shot!!"}
{"text":"Still a solid 3 star experience  This time I tried their Malaysian Chicken Curry dish, with coconut cream sauce, potatoes, white rice and peppers. It was tasty, but nothing made dance the Irish Jig! Service was good and my date had a Seafood Ceveche which was good as well.  There are better Asian dining options here in Charlotte. But AZN's location make it a perfect spot if you're on Piedmont Row drinking wine at J Sam's wine bar.  Would I recommend AZN? Yes I would. Would I say there are better options in Charlotte? Yupper to that as well."}
{"text":"Very slow service. There was no one in the restaurant and it still took 1.5 hrs for lunch. Maybe nobody showed up for work. Food was ok, but very slow service mired the experience."}
{"text":"Nice decor, great service, great food.  If I was the seafood eatin sort I'd probably fall in love with this place, but since I'm not, I'll just have to really enjoy my visits.  The non-seafood dish I got (Malaysian Curry Chicken Obento box) was top notch.  The only \"notch down\" was the price of the food which puts it at the upper end of where I want for a lunch place (they're in Piedmont Town Center where I work).  Did I already say the staff is super nice?  Yeah, good."}
{"text":"Excellent use of fresh ingredients everything prepared from scratch. Great sushi, fish, Malaysia curry, and omg the fuji apple yum! I always enjoy AZN and the price is nice too!"}
{"text":"Visited AZN because my girlfriend lives in Piedmont Row and was craving some sushi on a Sunday night. They have a special on Sunday night where a selection of rolls is half-price (which means on par with normal sushi prices anywhere else in Charlotte).  Full-price is over $15 for A SINGLE ROLL.  Definitely a ripoff, especially given that the rolls are so SMALL (come on guys, I thought everything was bigger in the South! :-p).  Anyway, would not visit for the food again.  Ambiance is nice if you are looking to impress on a first date.  Otherwise, not worth the money."}
{"text":"AZN is tucked away in Piedmont Row, but it's definitely a stand out. It was fairly quiet the night we went in (a Wednesday), but I could see how it would be hopping on a weekend night. The circular bar looked inviting, and the dining room uses a water feature to set a relaxing vibe; the décor is modern without being too pretentious.   Onto the food! We ordered the Vietnamese Spring Rolls just to get a handle on what we were dealing with. (If an Asian restaurant messes up spring rolls, you know you're in trouble.) However, they were delicious. They definitely didn't skimp on the chicken, and the rolls came with two different sauces for dipping. For entrees, we got the Seven Flavor Basil Beef and General Tzu's Chicken - both were generous portions, and both meats tasted very high-quality. We skipped dessert, but the complimentary fortune cookies came dipped in chocolate. Consider my mind - and my taste buds - blown.    Additionally, our server went above and beyond to make it a fantastic experience.  Definitely a restaurant we'll have to head back to and maybe the best Asian restaurant we've tried in a very long time."}
{"text":"We tried this place out for lunch on our anniversary and opted for the all you can eat sushi for $16. You get what you pay for. We tried 7 rolls and wouldn't grade any of them above a C-  We definitely won't be back since there are so many other amazing options for sushi in Charlotte (Room 112, Akahana, Sushi 101, etc)."}
{"text":"EW Gross... This is NOT quality food. I ordered Pad Thai... and it was so gross. The chicken and shrimp first of all were fried... and because it is in sauce, they were mushy. I ordered 5 star (I like it hot) and received a 1 star. There was literally ZERO spice. The sauce was red...so I assume they added more paste... GROSS...  Seriously go elsewhere..."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch, 3 other tables, still took over an hour and that was with us constantly searching for our waitress every step of the way. First time at AZN, and our waitress was completely apathetic to that fact when we told her, no suggestions, nothing. Ordered the samba edamame which was actually delicious, but just took way too long to come out. Our entrees arrived, and immediately just saw pooling oil at the bottom of both dishes. The vegetables were definitely not fresh, as the mushrooms were obviously rehydrated, chewy, and inedible, as well as the dirty/old bokchoy pieces in our stir fry dish. I would advise that you pay attention to your itemized check once you get it, because i glanced over it before handing my card over, and noticed higher prices on the check than I had seen on the menu. Asked the waitress about it, and she said she would let someone know. Not a good first impression, don't think I will be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"I can see why this place closed down. Awful food. Place is so expensive. No one was every here."}
{"text":"Great food, lovely atmosphere. The waitress seemed a little distracted but aside from that we had a great meal. The calamari appetizer was average but the Korean short ribs were amazing ($30) and I enjoyed the sake flight as well. Huge portions and I'm told the sushi was very good. I'll save this spot for special occasions going forward, it was a little pricy for my family."}
{"text":"Food - mediocre.  Service - good and attentive  Place - good ambiance, classy/trendy, and young  The sushi is just way overpriced. I have ordered the \"Volcano\" roll ($18) because of the scallops. I didn't want to pay so much for 8 pc roll, but I love me some scallops!  So got the roll, scallops were way dry, packed with lots of Japanese spicy mayo, and you have your plain Jane California roll. It was such a bummer, and NOT worth the money. AZN crab cake - was decent, the pomegranate sauce overpowered the cake and made it not as enjoyable. The only thing I did enjoy was the seaweed salad - you cannot go wrong there!  Drinks - not too shabby, priced decently. A lot of my friends enjoyed their mixed drinks - so that was something to look forward to.  Not my go-to Japanese restaurant. Wouldn't mind coming here just for drinks and relax, since the place looked hip."}
{"text":"Had dinner here last night for the first time.  AZN is tucked away in the back of Piedmont Row.  I go to PR all the time and had no idea this place even existed until friends told me about it.  Nice big restaurant with 2 levels, a huge bar and outdoor seating in front.  I like the bar atmosphere much better than the dining area.  The dining area just felt commercial/industrial..not very cozy.  The service was good.  The manager welcomed us when we sat at the bar for drinks before our meal.  Tried a few  apps before our meal including edamame (spicy and regular), vietnamese spring rolls (not very good- these are fried instead of steamed) and some kind of eggplant dish.  For dinner I had one of the specials which was a fried snapper with a thai chili sauce..fish was a bit overcooked yet eatable. I believe this place could do well but they need to advertise or something!  The entire restaurant was empty last night (and it was Saturday night)."}
{"text":"AZN is a great Asian restaurant in here Charlotte. To start, I get the Miso Soup and the house salad with ginger dressing. Their Seven Flavor Basil Beef is out of this world. Try the Figi Apple for desert, It is huge, large enough to feed two or three people. They serve it drizzled with carmel, chocolate and nuts. The apple is a lightweight desert and it helps cleanse your palate at the end of the meal."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate under the porch of AZN this evening in the thunderstorm. It is quite nice that there is a sheltered outdoor area so that you can enjoy weather of any kind. Rain or shine. I myself love the rain as well as shine.  We had simple meals. Spider roll and tuna roll, dynamite shrimp as an appetizer and a kids portion of fried rice. Everything was between a 9-10 in terms of heat taste texture and freshness, oh an presentation. What I liked the most was the side salad was a dark green spring mix, not iceberg and romaine loke other Asian restaurants serve. And it was only $5 which is a reason I will return.  The waitresses are very pretty and nice. They're twins and it caught us both of gaurd. The manager or owner was very accommodating and the bartender looks like Theon Greyjoy, which was an added bonus LOL.  We can't wait to return and tell our friends about it."}
{"text":"Barely adequate Asian fusion.  Charlotte is full of fun, trendy places with food that sounds great on the menu and is bland on the palate.  That's what one comes to expect from this area, and AZN is another addition.  The Piedmont Row stretch of restaurants all have great decor and atmosphere, so AZN doesn't disappoint there.  The cuisine is not offensive, just not memorable.  Waitstaff was pleasant but inept...one server for a private party of 23...orders not taken for 40 minutes after serving...several members of the party did not get their orders taken though they were seated (the server apparently forgot where he started the order taking and thought he was done before getting to the last four patrons.)"}
{"text":"Very average. Sushi rolls are overpriced for the amount of food you get. The food itself was decent to good. I had the seven flavor beef, which was above average. A lot of the menu items are spicy. Lettuce wraps were good.   Two pet peeves - first, they poured red wine into my white wine glass. Second, the menus were laminated and glossy, which made them difficult to read.   Contrary to what some others have written, the decor was not anything special.  Lighting was also a little bright I think and tables too close together."}
{"text":"Great food, nice atmosphere, excellent service. Good portions, great flavors. Quality and freshness of food seemed good. If you are not on a budget, definitely try it. If you are on a budget, don't."}
{"text":"Ok food, nothing to go out of your way for.  Dessert tasted store bought and dry.  Service was not up to par either...  It was restaurant week and I was surprised at the lackluster quality."}
{"text":"I come here for lunch often, as I work nearby. Lunch dishes are good, priced reasonably, and served quickly. No complaints as it comes to lunch.   Dinner is a bit overpriced. Skip the sushi. It's expensive (even for the Southpark area) and it leaves a lot to be desired.   Try the curry bowl with the fried egg on top. That's a consistent and tasty dish."}
{"text":"This place should be way more packed than it is. I think people don't know what to expect here they need to put sushi bar on the sign. If you like Sushi this is the place! By far the freshest tasting fish in Charlotte. Service is excellent from the valets out front to the hostess and servers. They also have a nice patio. I'll be back."}
{"text":"After waiting in an empty restaurant for over 5 min for someone to acknowledge my presence at the bar, I did enjoy some good Sonoma Cutrer and edamame while I perused the menu. They have a good selection of various Asian dishes from sushi  to Thai curries. I decided on the chicken curry to go.   At AZN the food is good and they have a nice list of wines by the glass. The decor and environment are very attractive. Outside seating is certainly a great feature.  The rating I have given AZN might not match the positives I've mentioned however, from the perspective of the food, I can certainly find equal or better food in the city for much  less money. If you are willing to pay for the environment, then AZN is fine. Otherwise, there are many other Asian restaurants in Charlotte from which to choose."}
{"text":"I bought the group not even knowing where the place was because I love trying new places and I love Asian food. The place is located in Piedmont Row and has a great atmosphere.   We went on a Friday night and it was very slow.  Our waiter was good but not great. The food was also good but not great. The food itself did not justify the high prices.  The calamari was good but nothing you couldn't find anywhere else.  The Pad Thai and Mongolian beef tacos can definitely be found better at other places in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Me and my Fiance got the Korean burger and ribs. They were fantastic! We will totally be back for more."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time tonight & I totally love it.    Great Asian apps & food.  Great Happy Hour Specials.  Chill music & vibe.  Excellent servers & bartenders.  Friendly & welcoming manager.  It looks like an awesome patio area for warmer days/evenings & it's easy access & parking in Piedmont Row.  We tried the Shrimp Tempura Roll, Shrimp Dumplings & the Lettuce Wraps.  They were all good & amazingly, they have even numbers on their appetizers! Bonus Points!  We tried a Strawberry Lemon Drop which was really good, the Blood Orange Cosmo which was really good & the Zen-gria which was meh... not very fruity, but not horrible.  They add Grand Marnier to it which helped a little.  It doesn't seem like this place is on the radar yet, but it should be.  Plenty of space for dining, an upstairs dining area & a nice, large bar with several tv's.  We'll definitely go again."}
{"text":"The Charlotte Restaurant Week celebration continues! We went to AZN on Monday night for a pleasant and delicious dining experience.   Parking was a terrible experience so if you go try not to go down the staircase that leads to the trash area. We were on the second level, section C.   When we walked up to AZN we were promptly greeted and lead to a booth by the window. We selected the Firecracker Roll and Red Dragon Shrimp to start with. The Red Dragon Shrimp were amazing! The appetizer included several portions of these piping hot perfectly seasoned shrimp. I was definitely jealous I did not order a whole portion for myself, but thankfully the boyfriend is generous and shared several helpings with me. The Firecracker roll was good (but I took off the freshly sliced jalapeño before eating it - I know my limits!).   The Korean Beef Short Ribs were good, but the temperature was a little cool like it had been sitting a while. The curry on the Thai Red Curry Duck was a great subtle spice. We ended with the Cheesecake Spring Roll which was something I had never tried before and while I liked it I would have preferred more of the sauce they drizzle on.  The service was top notch throughout the meal with our waitress watching her tables from the bar and bringing refills as soon as they were needed. A manager (or owner?) came at the end to deliver our dessert and asked how we enjoyed the meal. I am not sure I would return for the full priced menu but for the $30 experience I thought the meal was great. We definitely plan to return for their half priced sushi on Sunday nights or escape from work long enough to take advantage of the all you can eat lunch special."}
{"text":"Finally great Asian food in Charlotte. Everything was incredible.  The grilled dumplings were different but tasty and the sushi was really fresh.  Also tried the String beans and Chicken.  It wasn't greasy or chewy like a lot of the asian resraurants around here.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"First of all, any place that changes \"S\" to \"Z\" for no apparent reason already deserves a one star downgrade. It's like changing \"Cheese\" to \"Cheeze\" so you know you're not getting the real thing...and you ain't the real thing, baby! NUH-UH!  Sure, the ambiance is nice for a business lunch in Southpark...but really, I'M HERE FOR FOOD. I'd trade ambiance for quality food any day.  If you want overpriced mediocrity, please enjoy. I ordered pad thai which came with a complimentary side of overpowering pungent fish sauce smell.  Personally, it reminds me of my mom's Vietnamese kitchen, but I'm sure that's not what the chef intended.  I added an extra side of Siracha sauce, and the dish was still flavorless. No veggies or limes or peanuts (we're still talking about pad thai, right?) so there wasn't much texture/flavor to the meal, but enough noodles to be full...not satisfied...just full.   If you're in the area and craving Chinese, go to DragonFly or Baoding.  If you want sushi, go to Cowfish. I'm still waiting for a good Thai place nearby."}
{"text":"Arrived at 220 on a Friday, the sign outside said their buffet went until 230.  Wanted to order a few rolls, it the owner said they would take too long to make.  Then the proprietor said the buffet closed at 2, I pointed out the large sign on their sidewalk that clearly stated that they served the buffet til 230.  They did not want my business and I can assure them they will now never receive it.  I was in the restaurant business for years and would never treat a customer the way I was treated by the staff at AZN."}
{"text":"Great service, sushi roll tasted clean, fresh, and plated nicely. I had the dynamite tuna roll with asparagus spears. I like that they offer brown rice as a $1 up charge for a healthier alternative.  We also had fried brown rice, that came with large shrimp,  all white meat chicken and crisp veggies.  Definitely one of the best Asian spots in Charlotte"}
{"text":"Pretty good sushi and atmosphere.  I'm worried that the location might be an issue as it's never really that busy.  The prices are expensive too.    Went a few days ago for lunch and our waitress was a tad slow and was a bit stumped on our gluten free questions, but other than that, I like coming here..."}
{"text":"I must say this is one of my ALL TIME favorite restaurants in Charlotte. Whether it is with clients or for a personal lunch, I find myself here at least once (likely twice) a week! From the amazing food to the genuine and attentive staff, you'll likely become a regular after just one visit. The entire staff has an unparalleled commitment to customer satisfaction and are determined to meet your dining expectations. I simply can't sing their praises enough. If you are looking for a trendy but elegant Asian cuisine dining experience with great service to boot then look no further. Go to AZN!"}
{"text":"A group of my friends and I came here for Chinese New Year and we were astounded by the friendliness of the owners and the tastiness of their family style feast. We enjoyed dumplings, whole fish, sweet and spicy short ribs, lovers fried rice, seven treasure soup, stuffed chicken, large spicy mustard shrimp, grilled pork, etc etc etc etc. The food just kept coming and we were awestruck!   Not only did the owners make us feel like old friends, they delighted us with a noodle making demonstration and a dragon dance! Wow! I took video for my review blog ;) It was energetic and fun to watch.  The wine was also really good, and when the server brought us the wrong one, he gave us  our selected bottle for free! What service! Five stars all around... I am so glad that I live nearby so that I can enjoy their spectacular food all of the time!"}
{"text":"My perpetually late cousin and her daughter didn't believe me when I said Cowfish opens at 6 and we need to be there early... Since the elder was in a bit of a sushi mode (and apparently tired of Sushi 101), that's how we ended up at AZN...   Luckily we arrived within their happy hour period, so the prices were decent... If I had paid any more for what we received, I would have felt a little bad about it... lol    The drinks were $5 and while they tell you what they are, they don't describe what they're made of...  That's kind of weird to me... I mean, they take all the time to come up with cool names, but don't bother telling you what's in there?  That's part of the fun...  Oh, we both had a Japanese mojito... I thought it was pretty refreshing, my lunatic cousin thought it tasted like dish soap... I asked the bartender and she said sake, ginger, ginger beer and some sort of Japanese plant (I forgot the name, sorry).  I ordered the Kobe beef sliders which came with the pickled vegetables and a bimimbap sauce... Good and spicy... The bread kept falling apart which kind of irked me, but sometimes it's like that... The samba edamame had togarashi (which is sort of like a chili pepper), chili-sesame oil and sea salt... They were my favorite part of the meal, actually...   My cousin and her daughter split a shrimp tempura and another type of roll and they said it was just okay...  My main issue here was the service... Now, don't get me wrong, the people were incredibly nice... I liked our bartender, the hostess was sweet and I think the other guy I saw a lot was the manager who had a great attitude as well... The thing is they were very understaffed and it didn't even seem that busy...  It took about 40 minutes for our food to arrive and a while still to get the ticket...  It was probably just an off night, but who knows?  Either way, my cousin says she definitely won't be back... I might give them another shot since I loved the soybeans..."}
{"text":"Went here on a whim and was pleasantly surprised. For a Saturday night the restaurant was not busy which made us nervous... after eating I do not understand why. Our service was top notch... the server recommended the Mongolian Beef Tacos to start, excellent choice. It was served in a build your own style which is perfect if you have people sharing. The meat was flavorful and tender... it came with 4 tortillas, but there was only enough meat to make 3 tacos, if there were 2 of us eating we would have made only 2 tacos. For dinner my brother and his GF had sushi... I do not eat sushi but they said it was some of the best they had. They ordered the enter the dragon roll which my brother raved about. I had the 7 spiced basil beef which had an amazing flavorful sauce with lots of depth. My brother left his credit card there, thankfully I had made a reservation thru open table and they had my phone number and called us to come get it. I would definitely try this place again."}
{"text":"I found out about this place because a paint night event hosted by The Createry was taking place here. I love sushi and shortly after finding out they offer a half-price sushi menu on Sundays (the day I would be there for the event) I knew I had to give it a try.   Of the five rolls my bf and I deduced the specialty rolls were significantly better. The 'Enter the Dragon' roll was easily my favorite, and I highly suggest it to anyone who enjoys imagine/eel. As for the more basic rolls, spicy tuna and salmon avocado, I didn't think they were anything special and I've had way better before. But for half-price I really couldn't complain.   Our server was fantastic, very friendly, timely, and never let my water glass get below halfway gone. Especially impressive because they were a bit busy after the event.   All in all, I would go back here on a Sunday in a heartbeat. Also, an added bonus was that Piedmont Row (where it's located) was all decorated for the holidays, so it was very pretty to walk around outside as well."}
{"text":"Food: I love their spicy calamari! Best in town! Sunday 4-9pm, half off sushi menu. Love the spider roll and Enter The Dragon Roll! Also try AZN Lo Mein.   Service: The service here is second to none!!!"}
{"text":"We had date night here last night and the food was excellent, the staff was very friendly, and the cocktails were great. The place was empty on a Saturday night, which is sad and surprising. I think the location, tucked away in the back of Piedmont Town Center, is to blame. I'd hate to see a great establishment go under due to lack of awareness. I'd eat here again and definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"1/2 price sushi menu on Sun and Mon nights! Can't beat that! The wines by the glass are good quality and reasonably priced. The atmosphere is pleasant and cozy without being too dark or too loud. Wait staff very attentive - sushi was excellent -  Will definitely return!"}
