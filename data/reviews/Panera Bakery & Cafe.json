{"text":"We have been going to this diner every Wednesday from 6:45-8:45am for an eight person meeting in which everyone buys breakfast for nearly a year.  This morning we arrive to be told that they now don't open until 7am without any prior warning. What makes this completely backward is they are in there baking anyway and choose to slight loyal customers for what? To not have to pay a counter person? Boo! I will never spend another dollar at your location."}
{"text":"You can't go too wrong with a chain cafe, however, I love chicken soup. It is a pretty standard soup, but when I ate here for lunch, it was cold and flavorless. The staff is pretty nice but the food needs some serious work. My salad had wilted, uncrisp lettuce. I didn't eat much and went back to work still hungry."}
{"text":"Panera took this over and what a disappointment - instead of ordering directly with the preparer, now you order through a person - lost is the interaction as your salad is prepared to your liking - plastic utensils, tiny water cups, cookies are no longer 2 for 1 - nothing needed to be changed - I won't be back."}
{"text":"Overall good. Wish there was more meat on the sandwiches and they should still give you a cookie when you purchase a pick two."}
{"text":"Best cookies of all time.  Everything is good.  Mango iced tea, soft bread for sandwiches, amazing salads, coffee muffins and fast service."}
{"text":"Not sure why one star. The \"service\" is awful, no  one there seems to be happy to be there, not one smile, not one greeting, everyone looks bored, or annoyed. The food is blah, nothing appealing, not bad, just blah. The ice water was good, maybe that is what justifies the \"one star\". Anyway, I won't go back."}
{"text":"Terrible service, and the inside was unclean. I have been to other locations numerous times and have never experienced anything like this. A real shame."}
{"text":"I have been to this location several times. It is in a shopping center that I go to regularly. However, I am just a little leery about what they sell here. Every single salad comes with Chicken. While I usually do not eat Pork. Lately I am not eating Chicken either. It all boils down to the way they treat the Animals. I know that the Poultry industry is in a lot of trouble. The Chickens are very unhealthy. They are dying at an alarming rate. They are filling them up with antibiotics and other things I do not want any part of.
So I would like to see,More choices, than just chicken.
If they can't carry Fish, then maybe start with Tofu, or more vegetables, or fruit.
 This particular Paradise is set up very strangely I find.
There are no directions that tell you where to begin. The line seems to start at the cookies. Then you pay. Then you go to the sandwiches, salads, and soup. It all seems quite confusing. You almost have to ask which direction to take. 
Other than that, it is nice. It is nice and cool inside. I had lunch whilst waiting to have my car washed and hand waxed. 
So I got the guys a box of cookies as a little something extra for them. They were very happy with it.
Their coffee is good at Paradise and they have a reward system you use a card for your points. A bit like Panera but, you have to tell them that you have a card , they don't ask you in advance.
Lots of parking outside.It is an open lot."}
{"text":"I used to love this place... When it was Paradise! Now that Panera Bread took over it's pretty bad. I was pretty bummed when I walked in to find that the club sandwich with the croissant bread is no longer there because they don't have croissants. I ended up just getting broccoli cheddar soup which is still the best. However, when it came to my table there was no cheese on top. When I asked if it still comes with cheese on top they told me it costs extra... Seriously? Then, I decided I wanted a cookie. I was majorly annoyed that there cookies are the same price but now they're not buy one get one. Panera Bread ruined Paradise."}
{"text":"Its hard to review this place because it lacks in customer service but has great food.  Whats really annoying about this place is their separate stations.  One station for salads where the salad people cant talk to you unless you are ordering a salad and a sandwich section where you guessed it.  LOL you better be ordering a sandwich or they are gonna get pissed!  Sounds hilarious oh and it is but this does happen and I am sure that it hasnt just happened to both me and my husband a few times.  Anyway only because we made the grave mistake of speaking to the sandwich guy who told us we had to speak to the salad guy standing right next to him have we ever really had a problem with this place.  That vibe has been going on awhile and I feel it at every single Paradise I visit so its obviously a problem management should look into.  I think it might be appropriate to have cross trained people that can help you whether you order a salad, a cookie, or a sandwich.  Know what I mean?  Anyway the food is the only reason this place survives I love the Fuji apple turkey salad and it happens to have the lowest calories which is awesome since its the best.  My husband likes the steak and blue cheese salad and it is freakin good.  Lately we have been getting a couple cookies and the chocolate chip with coconut on top is the best."}
{"text":"Thanks for not being Starbucks or Panera. Starbucks brew too strong Panera makes watery coffee. This place has choices.  I prefer light roast an really fresh!

yummy treats and healthy food choices.  

Glad I found it. Will come here whenever I visit the area."}
{"text":"I love Paradise Bakery and eat there often, it has been hard having some locations close and change names. My friend and I met at Paradise Bakery and were shocked at how rude an employee Jenna was to the other staff working. When you are rude to other people it reflects bad on you. Jenna, you need to take a BE NICE class."}
{"text":"This is now Panera and it blows. Bizarre ordering, totally disorganized, many tasty menu items gone and the big disappointment is no more cookie with your meal, instead you get a hard chunk of bread circa 1940's Soviet bread line."}
{"text":"I really. Like the roasted tomato soup had that & a chicken Caesar salad. Nice portion size, friendly staff who took time with customers. Their portion sizes are larger than Wildflower Cafe across the street."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for several years and it is usually pretty good, but the ordering process is fractured and often times they screw up your order.  With that being said the Chicken Walnut sandwich has always been a fav of mine their coffee is fresh and hot,  the smoothies are tasty and the cookies are chock full of butter and sugar."}
{"text":"One of the worst Paradise Bakery in the valley! Dingy and unclean. Customer service is nonexistent. Yes I'm here for food so get your lazy butt away from your conversation or phone and help me so that I won't get hangry at my hubby! Is that too much to ask for?! I love how the employees look like they don't want to be at work and that you're annoying them for even coming to order food and giving them business. I gave this location 2 stars because I actually like the food but next time I will take my happy butt to another location where it's much cleaner and have nicer staffs."}
{"text":"Sandwich size=1/2 the size of the same type of sandwich at Dilly's Deli yet costs the same price ($8.08 with tax). Bread was dried out and hard on the edges.
Food quality= fake smoked turkey (the kind of turkey slices you get in the sealed packets at the grocery store with the artificial smoke flavor that you belch for the next two hours).
Service=think high school cafeteria with a tray going down the serving line.
Atmosphere=so loud you can't hear yourself think, let alone visit with a friend.
Parking=think of vultures circling carrion on a 120 degree Phoenix day. Yep, too few parking spaces for the businesses at this end of this shopping center so forget getting anything close to the door.

Were there any positives? Well, they do have an outdoor seating area. Wait, there was no misting and I noticed no one sitting there at 11am on a 101 degree day, so pretty much useless except for a few winter months.
Meh. I've experienced better and for a lot less money."}
{"text":"Great healthy options plus delicious baked goods. Very spacious area inside plus outside setting & free wifi. Parking lot is always a bit packed as strip mall location is busy."}
{"text":"This was my first time at the Paradise Bakery on McClintock and Guadalupe. Worst service I've ever had at a Paradise Bakery! Don't bother! The staff just lounged around and looked at each other when I asked for help. Other Paradise Bakeries have much better service or you could go across the street to Wildflower Cafe. Wildflower Cafe always has consistent service and awesome food."}
{"text":"It's a little bit strange that for a place that has the word 'bakery' in it, their bakery goods are not very good. Forget about ordering anything at night, by then everything has been sitting out for a millennia and has become chewy and hard. Pray tell us what shall we order? The saving graces are the mac and cheese (white cheddar over shells, so gooey!), and the tomato and mozzarella on ciabatta. Normally I never get real excited about anything but this is fresh, hot, gooey, and with the right amount of sun-dried tomato pesto in it. Kind of tastes like you are eating a spicy chorizo sandwich, if such a thing existed."}
{"text":"I was told that Panera Bread is so much like Paradise Bakery but I'm just not sure. Many of the old Paradise Bakery's have turned into Panera Bread's so when I am craving soup or sandwiches this is my only choice. 

I do like the Kiosk for ordering. This is a great tool for customers on the go. They do offer a large selection of sandwiches and soups. I'm a little bummed they do not offer pasta salad. When you order soup, bread comes with it but you also have the option of getting more dinner rolls. 

Clean establishment, and the service was wonderful. I appreciated that they brought me my food and I didn't have to stand and wait for it. Lots of place to charge your phone too

While the food didn't really impress me that much. (I still prefer Paradise) I'll still give this place another  chance."}
{"text":"Thank you Salad Guy tonight!! Sorry I didn't get your name but I know it was around 8pm and you were super helpful because I haven't been in for a while and the new menu threw me off and you made some great recommendations. I'm just finishing my Greek with chicken and you rock for throwing in 5 or 6 pepperchinis! The last time I asked for \"extra\" (at another location) I got 1 more. Thanks for the great customer service!"}
{"text":"As Paradise it was a favorite for our family - now as Panera we avoid it at all cost!  The food is stale tasting, the coffee is like dirty water, it's hard to order and all the favorite options are gone too!"}
{"text":"Gotta say there has been significant improvement here.  Greeted upon approach to counter and they're prepared to take our order.  
I think they know us.  Is that good or bad?
Manager was apologetic about the snafu from our prior visit and its likely she recognized us from that evening.
Sandwich was prepared and we were asked if there may be a desire for extra condiments.  Very attentive.  A salad for me and wouldn't you know, I have questions about something I've never had.  A breakdown of the menu item and I decided it sounded like what I wanted for dinner.
Overall a VERY pleasant dining experience.
Thank you Paradise."}
{"text":"I'm highly disappointed in paradise bakery, I've been here twice now and both times gotten tricked into a $10+ lunch. The whole pick 2 is very misleading leaving you to believe that the price for 2 items will be the one price when in fact is per item. My first experience with this i received an apology from the employee stating that yes the way it's advertised is misleading. Which leads me to today. I came in with a coupon which states: purchase one you pick2 get one pick2 free, after my last experience i assumed this ment per pick2 item considering they charge individually technically. I knew i should have went with my gut and clarified before ordering but i assumed the coupon ment what it said. Next thing you know i am getting another $12 lunch that i did not want to spend. The girl that cashed me out did nothing to rectify the situation but made their confusing menu pricing my problem. As i sit here and eat the driest club and most bland broccoli cheddar soup i am regretting not going to pei way next door. I will never be coming back to this establishment for seems like they just want to scam you for as much money as they can....I'm truly disgusted"}
{"text":"Sandwiches are overpriced. Especially for how shitty they are.  I mean, what kind of asshole ruins a Cuban sandwich with sweet pickles?  The soup I got was decent, but nearly $15 for a bad sandwich, soup and a small soft drink is a rip off."}
{"text":"I LOVE paradise bakery, however this location has the worst service I have ever seen. Been coming here for a year, and they are still so incredibly slow. I drive 5 miles out of the way because this location is SO SLOW"}
{"text":"I used to eat at Paradise Bakery a lot but I hadn't been to one in a few years. I was starving and this location was on the way back home so I stopped by for a sandwich to go. When I stepped into the restaurant I looked at the menu and thought... Hey... This menu looks exactly like Panera Bread's menu! Turns out, Panera bought out Phoenix-based Paradise Bakery several years ago. 

I got the Mediterranean veggie sandwich. It only took a few minutes to be made. I'm not really a big fan of Panera and this sandwich didn't really change my opinion. While the sandwich bread and ingredients were very fresh, they didn't taste that great together. 

Service was excellent at this location. Everyone was very friendly and on top of things. My sandwich was packaged very well and sliced neatly in half.

At least you still get a chocolate chip cookie with your order! It was the best part of my lunch :)"}
{"text":"It's pretty much what you'd expect, weak coffee and all. That said, It's a perfectly bland corporate-looking setting for late morning studying, which is the only reason I keep coming back for more."}
{"text":"Always get great service when I come here.
Much better than the Tempe  Marketplace location."}
{"text":"I have been a loyal Panera customer while living in another state; which, had excellent food. I'm terribly disappointed with of all things the quality of several bread items that I have recently gotten. I've had stale tasting bread, hard chewy bagels that could break a crown! The salad I recently had was, however, well made and tasty."}
{"text":"I don't understand all these negative reviews. When I walked in the servers were nice and helpful. My son ordered the Cesar salad and then after it was made asked for chicken and the server was nice and friendly. No issues with the service here. 
I had the turkey cranberry sandwich. It was fresh and I thought it was really good. My son had the Cesar salad and broccoli and cheddar soup. The salad was fresh and good. The soup was ok. Not great. Overall I thought this place was good but they do have the best cookies."}
{"text":"Ok! OK!  . . . Coffee and pastries are definitely my idea of a little bit of heaven-on-earth. But the coffee must be fresh and strong and the pastries must be made with the soft hands of knowledge and care.  One simply cannot throw together a good cup of joe; nor can a delicious melt-in-your -mouth pastry be dropped from heaven without a bakery angel watching over the careful assembly of ingredients. 

The ultimate goal must be a gastronomic paradise . . . . with rich dark coffee to balance out the sweetness . . . oh, wait, that's Paradise! On my way! Meet you there?"}
{"text":"I am originally from the eastern side of the states.  I am accustomed to Panera Bread. When I moved to Phoenix, I was saddened to learn that there are no Panera Breads in Arizona, only the generic Paradise Bakeries.  I had heard that Paradise Bakery is owned by Panera, but it is no where as good as Panera.  Their ingredients lack quality and it seems like you have to pay a lot more for the specialty sandwiches and salads than you would at Panera. I ordered the \"pick 2\". I informed the lady taking my order that I wanted to stay within the $6.99 price (its more if you choose specialty items), but I was confused by the menu and I unknowingly ordered a more expensive sandwich.  

When I went to go pay, they told me a higher price and I was confused.  The lady (Christine/a) seemed very annoyed with me when I tried to change my order. Over all, she was very unfriendly and she seemed like she really did not like her job.  I specified I wanted mayo on my sandwich, which I did not get and so I had to go back to the counter and bug someone for mayo (there was none laying out to conveniently take).  The guy I asked had to tell another guy that I needed mayo and they acted like it was some grand task. The sandwich was just a slab of deli turkey meat and lettuce on white bread. As part of the \"pick 2\" I also got the Caesar salad.  It was a large serving but the dressing they used was horrible. This is not an isolated incident.  I have been to Paradise a few times before, and I have never had an impressive experience."}
{"text":"Out of rolls, out of flatbread, out of toilet paper in the ladies room and only 745pm"}
{"text":"I wish I could rate it higher because the girl was very nice to help me however the selection was lacking today and the wait was super long. There were zero brownie bites available and only one box of carrot bites. And two ready made boxes of cookies and only one plain bagel...I'm on the run most days and need quick fresh treats available and typically can get my needs met here."}
