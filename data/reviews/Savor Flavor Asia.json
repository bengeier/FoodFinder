{"text":"bad, bad, bad.  the chow mein was edible and that is literally the nicest thing i can say."}
{"text":"I've seen this place change ownership before but not with renovations and reinvention like it currently has. This place is great. They tend to deliver in about half the time they quote (but I am nearby) and I think their prices are pretty reasonable. It's the classic, nearby, Asian food delivery service that's actually good. Thanks"}
{"text":"This place used to be good when it was Neo Tokyo but it was recently switched to savor flavor . I was hesistant at the change of the owner but decided to give it a shot . When i went to the register i noticed alot of ppl sitting around waiting for there food but placed my order anyways. After waiting about 20 minutes other ppl who were there before me started complaining about the wait so i went to check on the eta of my food and was told about 30 more minutes. I explained i had already been waiting 20 minutes and was rudely told that i should have been told about the long wait when my order was placed. I advised that i was not and recieved a refund and left . 50 minutes for chinese food seemed a bit excessive for a to go order. Will not go back again unless calling ahead . Waaaaay ahead."}
{"text":"Being an Irishman, I order the stereotypical fare of General Tso's and/or Orange Chicken. I like to mix it up with some gyoza and crab puffs from time to time, but I keep it pretty simple. That being said, I think you can judge an Asian place by its wok food like you can judge a steakhouse by its steaks.

Neo is pretty dang good. I don't like their crab puffs, but that's just me. Their gyoza are awesome, the wok food is good, and they offer brown rice which I think is really cool. The prices are very fair, and they have 24/7 coupons on their website.

I highly recommend you give them a shot, even if they're not the best Asian place in the Ahwatukee area."}
{"text":"Friend and I tried for the first time today. Fantastic first impression with customer service. I have a TON of food allergies and they were very quick and welcoming to accommodate. Would recommend to all! Good food of course too :)"}
{"text":"We tried the teriyaki chicken and Asian spicy chicken. Both were very good!  If this was located a little closer to us, we'd definitely come back on a regular basis. Wide variety to choose from on the menu including crab puffs, edamame, etc. If I could rate 4.5 I would - the only downside is that it's small inside so not the most welcoming place to eat, but if you want something delicious on the go, this is it."}
{"text":"Amazing garlic chili edamame. The Vietnamese Pho is the best around. Unbelievable broth."}
{"text":"Love this place! I usually order the orange chicken or the lemon chicken and both are delicious. I just recently tried their sweet and sour chicken and it was good, but not great, could have been more flavorful. They also have the best crab puffs!!! I have never ordered for delivery, but every time I come sit in and dine here the service is fast and friendly."}
{"text":"Great food. Worth the wait. Sesame chicken is my favorite. They also have a small patio outside."}
{"text":"Probably the best Asian place in Ahwatukee and decently priced. My only complaint: sometimes the tables aren't wiped down right away or properly. It would be nice if they had someone specifically designated to clean tables, since the cashiers can get a little busy sometimes."}
{"text":"People who work there are full of attitude.

Food is tasteless

Ice tea has no flavor

No point to the place"}
{"text":"The owners are super nice and the food is awesome. I am addicted to their BBQ pork and rice noodle dish. It is one my favorite places to eat and I look forward to it every time"}
{"text":"My take-out order was wrong, and they made no effort to fix it.  I ordered the kung pao chicken and they gave me chicken with zucchini and nothing else.  When I called to see what happened (where are the peanuts and the snow peas?????), they said that they ran out of snow peas two weeks ago and that they would credit me for the cost of the peanuts.  Mistakes happen, but I would have expected a better attempt at customer satisfaction.  They could have offered to make it again for me (and delivered it to my home), this time with the peanuts as required and a substitute vegetable of my choice to make up for the snow peas.  Nope.  Just excuses and an offer of credit for the cost of the peanuts.  They did not understand that I was TOTALLY UNSATISFIED WITH THE DISH, BECAUSE IT WAS NOT WHAT I ORDERED.  They were stuck on the cost of snow peas (which is why they run out of them from time to time, according to the person I spoke with on the phone) and the cost of peanuts (which they offered to credit me on my card).  I'LL NEVER GO BACK THERE AGAIN."}
{"text":"To begin with the interior was undergoing renovations but it was still clean and everyone was courteous. I ordered the lettuce wraps and a chicken fried rice and both were amazing. The food was prepared fast and was savory along with the lettuce of the wraps having a clean crisp crunch to them. Pricing is a little steep but not too bad considering the quality (way more fresh and better tasting than a panda express or other fast food chinese places). Apparently they will be doing some menu renovating soon but I hope that they keep the lettuce wraps and the fried rice the same as I will definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"It's obvious that the parts of each dish are thrown together, rather than cooked together.  Tasted like fast food Asian. I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Since I work at the movie theatre right next door, I'm always coming here for food! Everything I've tried has been great! Well cooked, fresh, flavorful.. They're probably not the best that Ahwatukee has to offer but as I go there often they employees know my name and they're all really friendly and friendless makes up for anything they might be liking. 

My favorite dishes would be the crispy orange beef and thai basil fried rice!"}
{"text":"Recently tried to go to dinner here with my mom and our experience was downright HORRIBLE. 

We decided to dine in so we placed our order and seated ourselves with a number. Although we only ordered 2 soups and a side of spring rolls, the two large families who placed their orders well after us received their food while we had still not been served! Finally, after my mom complained we were served the spring rolls and what seemed to be Wor Wonton Soup. After tasting a lukewarm soup, we noticed there were NO WONTONS! Only vegetables at the bottom of a large bowl of practically cold broth. 

When we mentioned this to the server, she said she would 'go put wontons in it'. Still about 15 minutes after her taking back the soup, I had not received my order. We complained a second time, they were apologetic, however we asked for a refund on the two soups because we felt like dining elsewhere. NOT worth your money OR your TIME. 

WORST customer service and neither of us will be going back."}
{"text":"Don't know why this place is getting such bad reviews.  Whenever my boyfriend and I go to the AMC 24 next door we always get dinner here.  He loves the Pad Tai and I love the Brocolli w/chicken rice dish.  The food is pretty good! The baby egg rolls are good too!"}
{"text":"Disappointed. I've had the Walnut Chicken many times and this time it's just not good.  The walnuts were thrown in dry and rice sticks were dry. I hope it gets better."}
{"text":"Great!! Yummy lemon chicken!! So fresh"}
{"text":"I am always looking for an awesome -non fried- spring roll...I found it!!!!!  Called in order (~5pm, early I thought) and was told pick up would be ready in 5-10 minutes.  When I arrived...~10 minutes later, there was still about a 10 minute wait.  However, first time ordering from here, was pleasantly surprised to see 6 customers eating in, 5 customers ahead of me...and another 7 that same in after I did.  

I also over heard a customer in line complaining about the amount of time it took for delivery the last time she ordered....they ended up being 'dine in' customers this time.  The manager came out, to their table, to apologize for their sub-optimal [delivery] service experience, and that it is not usually the case.  Also mentioned that their busiest times were 7-8 pm, but should not have influenced their delivery service...but was extremely apologetic.  Not sure if they were 'compt'd' anything...and didn't mean to be nosey!

Over all ...first experience, therefore not justified in giving a 5 star rating because am unsure of consistency.  However, is above 3 star (average) ...which is what I was expecting.  
I have rated it four star because when you walk in...seems like fast food...but a tad upscale from that in which you order, are given a number, and then served at the table, according to your number... (my order was pick up, but this is what I observed).  

However, once I arrived home and experienced my spring rolls and chicken pad Thai .....YUM YUM YUM!!!!  Will do again!!!!!  If consistent in the product they deliver...and seeing the immense customer base...especially so early for dinner, will consider a 5 star!  But overall...YUM YUM YUM...at great prices!!!!!"}
{"text":"Looking  for fresh, cooked to order, flavorful options to suit a varied Asian palette, this is the right place. Good to see this place in business and providing good tastes and good value to its customers. Some complained about service, some about flavor, and still others about size of portions. None of these things were an issue for us. We had an excellent meal here that started with a fabulous Thai Iced Tea and Vietnamese Spring Rolls. Wow! The rolls could not have been fresher. The freshness was augmented by a slightly spicy peanut sauce. We thought they would be veggies with a bit of pork, but also had a piece of shrimp in each half of each roll. My wife wanted something crispy to eat. So she ordered the Orange Beef and I the Katsu Don Chicken. I'm not usually one for anything fried, but was intrigued by the description of panko breaded chicken stir fry. It and the sauce was excellent! The Orange Beef was also very good. Neither was laden with veggies, but the manager has explained the limitations of the American palette and their willingness to special order virtually anything the guest wishes. That's pretty amazing for a \"fast food\" style restaurant. In the future, I will take them up on that and order some specific veggies to go onto my dishes.

Bottom line, it is so nice to eat fresh, made to order food, nicely prepared and served at a reasonable price. My wife and I will likely work our way through this menu looking for favorites. But for this side of town, this is our new favorite place to go for Asian cuisine. Give it a try and support our local restaurants! We don't need another chain restaurant, do we?

Oh, and as far as size of the entrees? Both of us are good eaters when we are hungry, and we were. But neither one of us could finish what was served and now we have a nice take home box for a small lunch tomorrow!"}
{"text":"Ordered the \"panang curried beef\". First off any \"Asian place that claims to do Thai, Japanese and Chinese ...probably not going to be good. I took a chance and I wasn't proved wrong in my previous statement. First of all the rice came on a paper plate and it looked like it was day old rice reheated in a loose pile.....second the \"panang curried beef\" came in a plastic container that looked like a repurposed salsa container. It was brown gravy like consistency with beef in it but almost nothing else. It was so friking hot that it was an obvious microwave job of previously cooked food. All this for 9 dollars. It didn't smell like panang it didnt look like panang. I took it back to the counter and the guy said no we cook everything fresh....funny thing is I look through the pass counter and see a whole huge sheet pan of cooked off breaded chicken in a rack. Do not waste your time and money on this place. I walked out disgusted."}
{"text":"I usually order food to pick up at lunch time. I always order Family Special 3 for $23. Today, I just ordered it again, and when I came to pick my food up it was $25 instead of $23. I asked the older guy who took my payment why it was $25 even though their menu still says $23. He rudely answered me because the minimum wage went up???? and that was all he could do. He also said that on menu it said *Price is subject to change without notice which I could not find anywhere on the menu.  I am ok with $2 different but you cannot say something and then charge something else. This is business not a joke."}
{"text":"Pretty good stuff and reasonable price. They deliver!"}
{"text":"I love this place. The Thai Basil Fried Rice is so delicious. Everything I've had is good. And the owners are very friendly and ready to hear what you would like on the menu. It's always busy at lunchtime. And the portions are big enough for lunch and dinner both.
Very good restaurant!"}
{"text":"Although the dishes were requested to be extremely spicy - they definitely lacked that and the request was obviously not adhered to.  However, on the plus side, two types of hot sauces/chilies were provided for the dishes and they did manage to add a little \"kick\" - although not nearly enough.

Dishes: Korean noodle soup, chicken w/ mushrooms, Thai basil beef, kung pao shrimp.  Despite the lack of spice, the dishes were filled with good quality meat and vegetables - no MSG or other extreme amounts of sodium.  I would definitely re-visit this place but please do keep in mind that the dishes are a bit \"Americanized\"."}
{"text":"The egg drop soup is the best I've had. The girl who took my order was very friendly and professional. The food tasted fresh and authentic. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We were so glad to find this restaurant! My daughter and I love Asian food but we have found that it is prepared very differently here from what we were used to on the East Coast. We are very happy with the food at Savor Flavor Asia. I love the crab puffs and Mongolian beef. Last time we were there, we tried the Vietnamese spring rolls and they were happy to make them for me without mint (an allergy of mine). Yummy! We're happy to go out of our way especially to eat here as we do not live nearby."}
{"text":"Pros: Nice, clean feel to the restaurant. 1 cashier was friendly.

Cons: Too expensive ($18 for teriyaki chicken and hot wings?), other cashier was rude, wings were terrible with jagged bone shards, noodles had a weird smell like Windex but didn't taste terrible (worse than Panda, though, and that's a low bar), teriyaki chicken had the same \"discount meat\" taste as the wings, vegetables were soggy and mostly seemed like an afterthought.

Used to love this place but haven't been back in several years. This new bizarre menu seems to be an \"everything-kind-of-Asian\" mashup, food quality is poor, and it no longer has that small business charm it had before with previous owner, Tina."}
{"text":"Needless to say, every time I  order a meal for delivery or to dine at this restaurant I'm totally pleased especially with their Chicken Panag or their Thai - basil fry rice. Furthermore, their prices are very resonably. Lastly, I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone that's looking for Awesome food!

{"text":"Was very tasty. Crab puffs were orgasmic. Good quality customer service. Was going to get their Asian wings, but they recommended not getting them. Thanks for that because your teriyaki chicken is really good."}
{"text":"I am very picky when it comes to Asian cuisine. That being said, I love Savor Flavor Asia. With a menu that encompasses several types of Asian cuisine, your options are certainly not limited. Well-prepared food made with fresh ingredients is a must for me and this restaurant certainly lives up to that. I highly recommend the Vietnamese spring rolls! Fresh and cool, they're perfect for a hot summer afternoon. The location itself is clean and modern, which makes it a fun place to enjoy the delicious food you will receive here!"}
{"text":"Tried the Thai Basil Fried Rice and the Pad Thai with chicken.
Very tasty, lots of meat, lunch price is $7.95. Very reasonable for a good amount of food.
Will return :-)"}
{"text":"Very good food.  We had the spicy more noodle soup and lemon chicken.  Portions are large.  Interior is remodeled and looks much nicer than when it was Neo Tokyo.  Glad they also deliver!  ---
Adding more after the last review.  We got delivery from Savor Flavor and it wasn't as good.  Hmmm.  Maybe they need to work on their delivery.  Spicy Korean soup was bland this time."}
{"text":"Great deals for lunch and kids' meals! Delivery makes it super convenient. When the owner was out of something I requested, she made every effort to make it up to me. I'm always satisfied and ordering online is extremely easy! Love the sesame chicken!"}
{"text":"I ordered food for dinner from this restaurant. Their website allowed the option to order online. Their order form had a place to enter the desired delivery time. I entered 7:00 pm, with almost an hour anticipation. Their website accepted my order and my payment, which cleared my bank almost immediately. Now, at 8:10 pm, I still have not received the food and the restaurant is not answering their phone. When I attempt to call them, there is a recording saying the account has not been setup yet,. My daughter had to leave without dinner for a shift at the emergency room at a local hospital because of this. I will never order any food from these people again. I will contact my bank and demand my money back. Terrible service, stay away from this place."}
{"text":"This is a great little spot, casual and quick and consistently delicious food at a great price. My favorite dishes are the Korean rice noodle bowl, spicy Korean noodle soup, spicy Korean pork with green beans , mushrooms, onion and carrots; although everything we've had here has been good. The new owners and the employees are always nice and quick to give us great service."}
{"text":"Their crab puffs are amazing! They serve a good amount of food. I normally can't finish all of it."}
{"text":"All fresh ingredients made to order and delicious!  Nice variety of choices, definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"I will never go back to this restaurant again.  The worst chicken Pad Tai ever!  No flavor.  Icky sweet, no green onion, no bean sprouts, tofu over cooked--hard, chicken was rubbery, no lime--I was given lemon, an no spicy heat.  A total disappointment."}
{"text":"I always order the hot and sour soup, pad Thai w shrimp and the fresh Vietnamese spring rolls. The Thai basil fried rice is good too. They deliver or you can place an order for carry out. It's convenient to my job and my home. There's even parking out front for a quick 20 minute pop in."}
{"text":"This is just an okay place to eat. My husband and I went for lunch on Saturday. We were hungry so we ordered the fresh spring rolls for an appetizer. They came out and they were not freshly made - straight from the refrigerator. The rice paper was hard and cold. It doesn't take much time to wrap spring rolls, so I don't know why they would make them in advance.

I can't remember what my husband ordered, but I had the vermicelli bowl. It was fine - the grilled pork was a little tough.

There are better dining options on this strip mall."}
{"text":"We love Savor Flavor ~ it is our go to local restaraunt.   Always yummy for us..   We have never had a complaint and always eat here."}
{"text":"No Rod I'm not a competitor just a Ahwatukee native that is being honest about the new ownership of the restaurant . I'm not trying to engage in a argument over Yelp . Nor am I interested helping you fix what you have ruined . Instead of adding new \"Vietnamese\" items stick to perfecting or improving your current recipes . Thanks hope your Business does well I just won't be there to support it ."}
{"text":"Our go to delivery Japanese restaurant. They're reliable, and give good portions of food. The miso soup is delicious! Chicken Katsu is one of my favorites."}
{"text":"Springs rolls are good I really like them. Pho is not the ehat I expected. No flavor at all. Pale no salt? Where is the cinnamon flavor. Not even the lemon and sprouts add soemthing to it. Dont order pho here."}
{"text":"Second time here so decided to write a review.  I live in Gilbert and happen to be in the area a couple months ago and again today. This is a delicious place to eat.  I love the casual, clean atmosphere.  Other at the counter type service.  Both times I got the Chicken Pad Thai.  Yummy. Portion sizes were good.  I got 2 free chicken egg rolls with my yelp check in as well.  Love freebies.  They were yummy as well. I love that they have several flavored teas to choose from as well.  Tea is so much better flavored.  Healthier than Soda as well. I definitely will be back when in the area."}
{"text":"Pretty damn amazing. Made from scratch definitely takes time, but WELL worth it. We eat here once a week at least and always dine in."}
{"text":"Good things come to those who wait. Savor flavor is probably one of the best Asian restaurants in the Phoenix area. People expect this place to be like Panda Express because it's in a strip mall next to a movie theater. However their food is made fresh every day and made to order. So sometimes on the weekends when they get very busy orders can take 30 to 40 minutes to get your food But I promise it will be worth it. My favorite is the sesame chicken. But I also love the pad Thai and my kids love the Pho."}
{"text":"Gluten free fried rice yay! They charge extra but guess I'm used to it w gf. Employees are friendly. I find it easier to just go in but they do deliver which is nice."}
{"text":"We have eaten here several times (5-6 maybe) and every time the food has been terrific!  The flavor,  temperature and consistency of the food is always spot on.   The restaurant itself feels like fast food,  but the quality of the food is well worth the price.  I personally like the food here so much better than Pei Wei (although I somewhat like the atmosphere of Pei Wei a little better) and the price is similar.

We will definitely visit again."}
{"text":"It was much better than expected. I had the spicy Korean noodle soup with lettuce wraps. They were very good. I can see us returning for take out or delivery. Dining in is less likely because we enjoy uncle bears next door as an option. We'd order again from here until we have a reason not to. 
Fast and delicious."}
{"text":"We like the strong Vietnamese coffee. It's a bit creamy, but pretty good. 

I agree with one of the previous reviewers that the portions are much smaller and pricier for fast food, but I guess we all need to eat a little less to trim down our waistline :-) Pho was okay, not that good, but most dishes are decent. Vietnamese bún noodle was not bad."}
{"text":"I've been eating here for a while and its easily my favorite Chinese food place in Ahwatukee!"}
{"text":"I had a craving for Thai food and was looking for a restaurant that would deliver. I found them to be the only Thai place in the area that would deliver so I decided to give them a try. 

They had a pretty good array of Thai, Vietnamese and Chinese food. I ordered fresh spring rolls, chicken lo mein, panang chicken curry with brown rice, and spicy chicken wings. All of this came out to less than $30! Even better, my delivery arrived in less than 30 minutes.

I found everything to be super delicious! The rolls were tasty as well as the peanut sauce. The chicken wings were perfect, not breaded, just slightly fried, with a spicy and ranch sauce to complement. The only thing that I would add would be more vegetables to the curry and noodles. It he curry only had carrots and some onions. The noodles were just chicken and garlic. 

If I ever need to order, I would again because of the speed, decent quality, and fair price."}
{"text":"Came here and I think the customer service stands out more than anything. I am so impressed with Robert that works here!! He is awesome! So friendly and welcoming. I got the sweet and sour chicken with wonton soup and it was very good. My mom got the orange beef and it was so delicious. Definitely going to come back and order that next time."}
{"text":"Their prices have really gone up. Food isn't anything special! Typical westernized \"Asian\" food. I use to come here 7 years ago and have come by now and then. It's alright."}
{"text":"I won't ever visit a business who leaves business cards on private property causing home owners to pick up after them. If you wish to market, do it right."}
{"text":"ordered 2 separate dishes. The pad Thai and the Ginger shrimp broccoli. this was delivery. the pad Thai was decent,  not the best I've had.  it was ok.  the ginger shrimp broccoli had NO FLAVOR.  it was a waste of calories.  I didn't finish it obviously.  I might give it another try with another dish... I feel like this is a Americanized Thai food place.  hence the reason the flavors were weak. very disappointed  $27 later too... over priced for such tasteless food."}
{"text":"I came in about 15mins before closing. I hate doing that, but I was hungry and I can eat fast (hey, I was in the military!)

The food was pretty good. I was a little scared that it would take them a while since it was close to closing but they got it out in a jiffy and it was well made. I even liked the veggies, which is good considering that I am picky with my veggies."}
{"text":"We have ordered from here several times, last night was our first annoying and inconvenient experience. The delivery was on time  the food was hot and yummy  but they didn't include the FREE \"check in\" crab puffs or the 2 Flan we ordered. The  on the sundae is when I called the girl that answered the phone seemed annoyed and had a little bit of an attitude......it's just food. I don't understand why people in the food industry get an attitude about something that's very simple to fix. I suggest just calling in your order instead of using the Yelp app because apparently that's what they said is the problem."}
{"text":"OK so I am a bit upset by the fact that Neo Tokyo changed management and when they did that they got rid of the sushi on their menu and they drastically changed the menu.  Even with that all in mind I did enjoy the food still.  I did however notice a difference in the taste, I cant say it was better but I wont say it was worse it was just different.

As for the restaurant itself the people are still very polite and helpful.  The decor is nice and calm and still looks very nice.  The menu change looks wise is nice they have gone from a cheap paper menu to a nice photo laminate tri-fold.  

All and all I would recommend this place to anyone.  Only thing if the new management is listening to this sight for reviews please please bring back the sushi menu.

P.S. They Deliver."}
{"text":"Service: 
Poor. I asked the gal what the Asian spicy chicken had in it. She didn't know so she asked another girl who didn't know either. The third girl they asked told me to look at the pictures on the wall. WTH? I gave up after that.

Food:
Bland.  I had the teriyaki chicken dish. It consisted of a lot of overcooked dry chicken and 4-5 tiny pieces of broccoli.  Even the Sriracha sauce was bland?? Not sure how that can be either. The white rice was good.  At least I'm full.

Would I go back? Probably not."}
{"text":"3 stars is lacking and unfortunately that was my impression. I ordered $45 worth of a variety for 2 togo. When I was leaving I asked if they included chopsticks etc.. And he said we don't add utensils (doesn't make any sense) I asked for hot sauce and they pointed me to a self serve. 

Their speciality fried rice and shrimp in lobster sauce was delightful"}
{"text":"Love this place. Full of flavor! Best Chinese in Ahwatukee. Love the fried rice and the wor wonton soup."}
{"text":"First off I was locked in the bathroom by a faulty lock. Was a small sticker sized notice that couldn't read without my glasses. Can we say fire hazard ?  I had to text my dinning partner to have a staff member get me out of there.
  Next our appetizers came out , we ordered spring rolls and got egg rolls . I told them they gave us the wrong thing and  proceeded to say I didn't specify the right type of spring roll . She wasn't taking no for an answer , eat the egg rolls or go with out.   There is only 1 type of spring roll on menu . Since there is a check in offer for a free order of egg rolls , I wouldn't want it if you gave it to me for free. I shoved the order in the middle of the table and said I am not eating this, please bring me my spring rolls.  So they came back with 1 order of spring rolls, we had two.  So now we had to go to the counter to ask for our second order.They decided to short us one to make up  for the 60 cent price difference .  Told them to bring it out and we would pay difference .  After I walked away the girl behind the counter told her boss that we agreed to accept only 1. The boss, owner , or who ever he was wouldn't come up and talk to us .  He stayed behind he counter and looked at me. I assume the girl  who said we owed 60 cents more or we were getting shorted was related to him.The whole time they were making this our fault. 
The order taker, when we placed the order repeated the order and said spring rolls. Next our meal came out . I had Korean soup he had cashew nut chicken. Neither had any taste . The broth was non existent. The rice paper on the rolls was so old it was tough and  partially uneatable. I couldn't teat it apart with both hands. We watched other people's  spring rolls come out . They looked fresh  and nicely presented. So we got thrown some old nasty rolls for \"ordering wrong \". Never coming back here again. Horrible service and horrible fast food .  Horrible management.I Walked out of there angry . Everything you ever wanted in a dining experience."}
{"text":"I've been here two times and both times were mediocre the food does not taste any authentic flavor at all. The rice is mushy and has no flavor sesame chicken was 5/10 at best eggroll was OK 3/10 I had raw dough around my eggroll and that was very unpleasant. Would I recommend it? No, unless you where absolutely starving and this was the last place open"}
{"text":"I'm in town, working out of a hotel this week, and after a long day the last thing I wanted to do was get in the car and try to find a Chinese restaurant.

I was slightly hesitant to order delivery from here because of the past reviews about food arriving cold, but let me tell you, I opened up all of the containers and the food was HOT!  Like still steaming hot!!

Good food, reasonable prices, easy and convenient online ordering, great menu selection, and fast and friendly delivery.... definitely will order again the next time I'm here!!"}
{"text":"What the heck is a rice noodle? I don't know but it's delicious...
I checked this place out again after a few years of living too far to drive too and I am happy I'm now back close enough to enjoy it once again. From what I have experienced so far after several visits is this is NOT your standard Asian takeout, and I LOVE that about it. Normally I consider all Asian takeout pretty much the same, and I usually stick to my 2 or 3 \"goto\" items. Not here...so far anyway. 

I met the new owner and his wife and asked what is good, and that's where it all started. They said they are enhancing the menu and adding a blend of Asian flavors, not just Chinese. They are both really nice and recommend something new every time we go. My wife loves the pad Thai and my new favorite is this yellow curry and rice noodle dish with veggies and chicken. I don't know the names of the stuff, but just point to the cool photos on the digital menu by the counter and go \"I want that one\" it's a cool change to actually see the exact item I'm ordering instead of just taking a chance on a dish I can't pronounce. 

Anyway...I highly recommend this place! I haven't be disappointed"}
{"text":"Well, after 25 years in the restaurant business this is a new one!  We ordered around $60 of food this evening.  I was very excited that my 8 week pregnant wife finally had an appetite, and she was feeling good enough to eat something.  The menu sounded very appealing and we were looking forward to trying a new place.  
It took over 1.5 hours for our food to arrive (keep in mind we live literally five minutes away) and was ICE COLD upon arrival.  I called back and asked to speak with a manager, who happened to not be present.  I left my number and asked that she please call me back.  She called me back and said that she had spoken with the owner and they were willing to refund me if I packaged the food up, they would have the driver come and pick it up.  What?  No offer to replace the food, or deliver fresh...just a ridiculous offer to refund me ONLY if I returned the inedible food.  As I mentioned I have been a chef and restauranteur for quite some time and never experienced or participated in such poor customer service.  I am currently the Chef of Innovation for a very large multi national Asian restaurant group and can proudly say that our policies generally tend to favor our clients...the polar opposite of what we experienced this evening.  I can forgive the mistake of the cold food, but the mismanagement or lack of positive direction from the ownership is deplorable.  Save your time, save your money...support restauranteurs that support the community and care about the relationship they have with their clients."}
{"text":"excellent fresh food, great taste of authentic cuisine will return and definitely recommend fast delivery"}
{"text":"Had the \"Vietnamese pho\" and was very disappointed. The broth lacked in flavor, not enough meat and noodles. Very Americanized interpretation of pho."}
{"text":"Vegan and vegetarian friendly! The Broccoli Tofu w/ Garlic Sauce is my idea of comfort food, but they will  customize anything on the menu. I love this place!"}
{"text":"The food is AMAZING! This fabulous place is next to work and I hopped in there last week for the 1st time. I seriously can't say enough about Neo Tokyo. The portions are huge, enough to feed 2 or left overs. I had the Teriaki chicken, it  was  so moist and flavorful! I guess this place is so well know, that when I came back to work the next day, my leftovers were swiped at work! I had a lunch date with my husband this afternoon to share this new little jem I found. I ordered the terriaki chicken again, we also ordered the walnut shrimp, the hawiann fried rice, and spring rolls. The shrimp is amazing, and I was impressed by the quality and quantity of the shrimp. The hawaiian fried rice was also impressive. I would ask to add more pineapple to it the next time, I feel that you can never have to much pineapple in your life! ;) Oh an the spring rolls, delish! Flavor, texture, and no grese in sight!  All I have to say is BRAVO Neo Tokyo, your food is truly PERFECTION, and  you have gained two new lifetime customers!!!"}
{"text":"This is on my way home and in my neighborhood so I decided to stop in and see how the food is. I see the delivery car all the time. I ordered a chicken teriyaki bowl. I had the choice of noodles, white, fried or brown rice (extra charge). My bowl was delivered pretty quick, and the bowl looked almost exactly like the picture on the menu. Everything was very fresh and tasted good. My food wasn't spicy, but it did warm my throat. Maybe there is pepper on the chicken. I only mention it for those of you with younger folks who don't do any spices. The staff is so nice! The atmosphere is low key painted in mellow colors, nice decor. Seating is comfortable, and country rock track was playing. This is a pleasant place to eat. I'll be back."}
{"text":"This place ROCKS! I eat here several times a week as its absolutely delicious! They have a fantastic menu with a wide variety of entrees to suit everyone's craving. Bring the family or take some home... Or meet your friends for lunch... I also wanna mention Megan as she is usually at the register, great employee and great customer service... Thanks Megan! I hope your boss acknowledges what a great employee you are."}
{"text":"I thought I liked this place until I ordered delivery. I was charged $46.98 for my food and only received $24.00 in food. Called to let them know. I was on hold for 5min then told that I could get my money back, store credit, or have the missing food delivered. I asked for my money back and was told I'd have to contact grubhub for a refund. Not happy about this. Will not be ordering or eating from here again!!"}
{"text":"This was really  good Asian food, without any bad surprises.  

To start out, my wife is really fussy.  To the point where I get embarrassed with the particulars of her requests.  She wants food that has no MSG, it cannot taste oily she likes brown rice not white rice and the food can't be too sweet.  Food must taste like food, not candy.  Most other places layer on the sugar, MSG and oil.

Every time we walked by this place it smells really good, so I finally convinced her to try it.  She went into her usual complicated requests, but the guy was very patient with her, took time to explain it's only a teaspoon of soybean oil he uses, and that his combination helps with the taste.  To exclude it totally, it would not be what she would like.  It went a few rounds, but she agreed and we got our order.  I was simpler.  Kung Pao and white rice.  I was told I could get fried rice, I appreciated that, but opted for simple white rice.

The chef/owner was very concerned and asked what we thought after our take out was delivered to us.  Well, we had got it to go, so could not reassure him as yet.  But I appreciate that he cared enough to come check if we were happy.

Got home, ate that stuff up.  Wife was very happy.  You don't know what a compliment this is.  She is so fussy.  Mine was very good too.  We both agreed we will go back and try some more.  If they keep up the flavorful, not oily, not too sweet and good size (Pei Wei gives you 2/3 rice and 1/3 food.  This was full food and a side of rice.), it could be a regular place for us.

I understand that Orange Chicken is suppose to be sweet, so when I try that, I will not ding them.  It's just that not all things are to be too sweet, and they seem to have that down.  

GOOD JOB SAVOR FLAVOR!"}
{"text":"This is a very convenient place to eat.  Sadly, I only eat here once a year because after each experience, I swear never to return.  It takes a year to forget that decision, whereupon I try it again.  Well that day was today.  I eat anything, yet,  the teriyaki chicken over rice was horrible.  Tasted like the chicken was grilled days ago and simply reheated.   Rice was good.  Then, they poured teriyaki sauce over the top like pancake syrup.  Awful.  The eggroll  not fresh either.  Hey, teriyaki chicken is hard to screw up.   In summary, the food is not fresh nor cooked today.  I have had better at Jack in the Box.  Arg!@!!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times and I love it. They have Pho, Korean Bbq, Korean soup, curry, chinese food, its literally a tour of asia. Love it and it's very unreasonably priced. They are fast and fresh from scratch. Im very very picky and never give a place a 2nd chance if it tasted ehh then im not giving another try. They even deliver. I recommend the korean soup it is awesome."}
{"text":"This is my go-to for asian/asian inspired food delivery. Food tastes good, reasonably priced and convenient location. I tried other places and this is the best around. Always love the Thai Iced Tea and can't go wrong with most menu choices although entree portion should be a little bit more. Overall very satisfied with this restaurant."}
{"text":"Watched a movie next door at the AMC and we had a little time to grab some food.
Didn't want a full sit down restaurant as we had eaten at RA Sushi the night before. Our options were pizza, rubios or asian.

Grabbed a takeout menu and saw they had vietnamese, thai chinese, a little Japanese and korean.
Clearly you can't be great at all of these flavors but we decided to order.

Walked up to the counter where we were greeted by a nice young gentleman named Mike apparently. Very good with customer service and asking questions as well as answering some of mine.
Got pad thai with chicken and no peanuts with a side of kimchi. Hubby ordered shrimp pad thai. We used our check in offer for free crab rangoon.

Sat down and Mike brought our appetizer and kimchi first. Offered me chopsticks which I appreciated. Kimchi was fresh and very korean. Crab rangoon decent. Pad thai were great with lots of chicken and shrimp and flavorful cooked tofu. 
Mike came by offering samples of Vietnamese coffee. Nice touch and tasted great.
Pretty much full service except you order upfront. Nice comfy booths and tables with a couple tvs and outside seating.

We will be back!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed the Katsu Don. Was disappointed with the egg drop and hot and sour soups and with the crab puffs."}
{"text":"I went for lunch hoping to try something new in Ahwatukee. I ordered my lunch and took a seat. After noticing several patrons come and go I returned to the counter to check on my lunch order. It appears they had forgotten but would rush right through it. Several minutes passed and when I returned to the counter the your lady who had waited on me ran off to the back and never returned. Another person stood by then approached me. I asked for a refund which she all too quickly returned.
I'm not sure customer service is high on their list."}
{"text":"After getting diarrhea from eating the mediocre Mongolian Beef here, I think I would avoid any future contact with this establishment."}
{"text":"Probably the very worst \"Asian\" food restaurant I have ever eaten at in my life. The Mongolian beef and beef & broccoli were completely tasteless, the termpura was greasy, and the spicy wings were way overcooked. The only good things I would say about this place is that the service was good, and the tea on tap was very good. Everything else was horrible. I would rather eat airport Panda Express noodles than this food! Don't waste your money."}
{"text":"Cooked to perfection tastes amazing. I order Mongolian Beef and Teriyaki Chicken with side of Lo Meing and Traditional Fried Rice. I must say very delicious food. I would of gave it 5 stars but the first server that answered the phone almost lost a customer due to the fact that he wasn't that well knowledgeable about his service made the order difficult until he passed the phone to a lady who took control and got it back on track. Thanks for that Ma'am. Great food 4 stars."}
{"text":"For a quick and easy spot to eat this place is awesome. Walking distance from our home we venture here at least once a week. We love PHO, and their version is really well done! We have ordered delivery as well. Everything comes steaming hot and delicious! Fresh and high quality is how it's done. You will come back again and again. One of our absolute favs!"}
{"text":"Best ever.  I eat here almost every day and can't stop.  The best dish is the sesame chicken with fried rice.  the reviews on yelp blow my mind.  they obviously went to the wrong place.  I will say that the Pad Thai was not my favorite but it was pretty good.  Everything else has been amazing."}
{"text":"We tried to use their coupon today for a free lunch entree with the purchase of
a similar item, but was informed that the coupon was not good on Sunday. There
is absolutely nothing in writing on the coupon or in the restaurant's ad that has this limitation.
We decided not to dine here.

I think restaurants' risk creating ill will and loss of business by not clearly stating in
print what a coupon's restrictions are. It is very unlikely I will return."}
{"text":"We ordered take out.  Very good and tasty.  We had the soups and appetizer platter.  Spicy Thai rice.  We had delivery and he was very fast!  Would definitely eat here again"}
{"text":"Faster delivery than promised.  But a little over cooked egg rolls and lemon chicken. 
Have eaten inside before and both times perfect. I will try them again."}
{"text":"I have eaten here several times now and the food is really tasty. They have good quantity of veggies and protein to make a healthy meal. The service was a little messed up when i went to dine in but they fixed it for me. 
Price is extremely reasonable and this is a good place to dine in."}
{"text":"Not pleased with the service or food. Specifically ordered 3 orders of Vietnamese spring rolls and they brought us egg rolls. The pho soup had no flavor, very little noodles, 3 small slices of beef. Fried rice not the best and walnut shrimp just okay. 
When i let the staff know our order was incorrect, not only did they tell us they voided the order and credited my card, but asked me to leave my dinner just brought to the table and go back to the counter so they could charge me for the correct order. When i questioned the receipt that had $0.00 credited to my card, the Manager came over and did not even look at me and gruffly told the cashier, this is a credit. Its right and walked out of the restaurant. $63.00 was spent and it should have been $10 for the service and food. Will not be back, even if it were free. I'll keep my business at Pho 602 and Pholicious"}
{"text":"Best Asian food place to eat. They will totally customize your meal for you. Orange chicken? no breading? No problem. How ever you want your meal, they will make it that way. I orderedKung Pao Chicken....extra extra extra extra spicy.......Well it wasn't enough, had to head to the chili bar to spice it up even more.......THUMBS UP!!"}
{"text":"First time customer last night. Ordered the 3 items plus egg rolls for $26. Got TO GO and food was ready and well packaged for pickup.  Portions were good size and tasted mighty fine. Chicken LoMein, my favorite was delicious. The crunchy orange beef was good as well. The peppered beef was a bit tough but had good flavor. We will eat here again and I would recommend this food to others."}
{"text":"Some of the worst  food I have ever had, I would think twice before I ate here again even if I were close to starvation. Stay away!"}
{"text":"Orange chicken and fried rice was pretty darn tasty. Served very hot and the sauces were hearty and flavorful. I can't tell you how much I dislike runny Chinese food. This was very good - much better than your typical fast food \"orange chicken.\" 

When you're in there, take a look at the wall on the right (when you're facing the counter) to see pictures of the different dishes. If they don't get your mouth watering, I don't know what will. The gyoza and crispy puffy appetizers looked great. I'm looking forward to going back and trying them all out."}
{"text":"It was okay. There are better places for Asian food I would go to. Food was at one point overly salty, and at one point flavorless. The staff was nice and it was relatively quick."}
{"text":"I have been there twice. And both times I have had great service and the food has been amazing. My favorite dish I have tried has been the spicy Asian chicken. It was perfectly crunchy and saucy. I have also tried the spring rolls which I absolutely love the peanut sauce that comes with it. This is now my favorite lunch place. I wish all restaurants had as great customer service like this place"}
{"text":"Better than average but certainly nothing authentic. Quick and friendly service was the best part of the meal. 

Their crab puffs are plentiful with the cream cheese filling and perfectly fried as were the chicken egg rolls. As for the sesame chicken It was deep fried as well and only a few chunks of peppers to color the plate, but the chicken was good sized chunks of white meat and the breeding was delicious. 

Next time I would ask if they had anything on the menu that wasn't fried and included fresh veggies. 

Suggestions: dress the plates better or not at all. If a person is eating in they shouldn't receive to-go packets of sauces. Also clean the floors so it matches the new clean looking tables & booths. 

Good Luck Savor Flavor!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place... delicious, fresh and a beautiful variety of Asian dishes"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Staff is always friendly and food is always good! Wings are good and the crab puffs are amazing!"}
{"text":"This food is fantastic! I like the Thai Basil Spicy Rice w/shrimp

I always order it with extra Basil and  it is jammed packed with shrimp- 
when I am home I sometimes put it in the skillet and add tomatoes and quick fry to make a bit more moist. 

The chicken curry is great and I sometimes add a cup of \"SoDelicious\" coconut milk in the skillet to make a fantastic gravy.

But it is all great right from the container!

The delivery service is fabulous, however, when ordering over the phone they are a bit rushed so I always ask them to read back the order to me and when I express any concerns they ALL WAYS LISTEN AND ACCOMODATE!!

Thanks Neo Tokyo you are highly recommended!"}
{"text":"There's nothing to savor in this restaurant. 
Their appetizer- Shrimp Tempura, expect 3 pieces of tiny FROZEN tempuras which is a total rip off. Their spicy Korean soup, yuck! I've tasted better INSTANT Korean noodle soup than theirs. I gave this restaurant a star since their Pad Thai was okay. Finally, after they serve your food, they'll serve your utensils...now your food is cold! Awesome!

But honestly, this is just a wannabe Asian restaurant. Never again! Money totally wasted...go some place else if you're looking for Asian food."}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this place based on the reviews I read. I ordered a chicken teriyaki bowl, Lo Mein kids meal, and an order of spring rolls. 

The veggies, rice, and sauce where good in the bowl; however, the chicken was WAY overdone. 

The kids meal, surprisingly contained a ton of noodles; however, they lacked a ton of flavor and again the chicken was way over done. 

The springs rolls were pretty standard."}
{"text":"Awesome authentic Asian flavors with their dishes, my favorite being the Vietnamese BBQ Pork and Noodle. Great value for great food, definitely worth giving it a try!"}
{"text":"Ive been craving udon and ramen probably for the last month or so. While I was in Awatukee today I saw this place in the shopping center I was visiting. Oh yeah, this is going to hit the spot!

You know when you're in trouble when you go in and the place is empty. Continuing in I saw udon on the menu board.. my cravings overrode my sensibility to leave, oh how do I hate my cravings. Got to the counter and couldn't stop myself.. order the shrimp tempura udon. After about 3 minutes later the smallest of bowls appeared.. can you call something this small a bowl, more like a bo since far to small to use the whole word. 

Well instead of griping about paying 7 bucks plus tax for my bo of udon cravings took over again! I tried the broth first.. hmmm, pretty unimaginative.. for whatever reason I though it was going to be good, just salty.. the shrimp, gummy and soup logged.. okay here comes the udon!!! Like eating rubber bands.. tough, chewy and actually kind of strange. The only thing that was decent about the bo was these little pink and white half slices.. very chewy and pretty cool texture.. I would have rather had a bowl of those then anything else in the bo in front of me. 

After about 5 bites I threw it out and left.. still craving good udon or ramen.. any ideas? Please!!!"}
{"text":"Good quality chicken for a teriyaki bowl.  I have not tried the other dishes, but they all look pretty good for fast food Japanese.  Too many places over cook the chicken, but not Neo Tokyo, their chicken is always plump and juicy.  They also have a nice teriyaki sauce and are not stingy with giving out extra!

Good job Neo Tokyo!"}
{"text":"We love this place! The food is always fresh and flavorful and the owners  and staff are super nice and very accommodating. I am gluten-free and they have a large  selection of items for me to select from. Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I have been here 3-4 times recently and have ordered the Kung pow chicken each time.  It's pretty tasty.  There is not really any \"pow\" but it's good.  This past visit I ordered the Katsu Don Chicken.  It was revolting.   It was a salty soggy fried chicken mess. And it is surprisingly on the \"most popular \" menu.  I am calling shenanigans on that one.   WTF!!!"}
{"text":"Pretty tough reviews but this was my first visit.
I went for the Panang Chicken Curry... not too spicy which was good and came with some rice and they had a coupon in their paper menu's at the desk for a free chicken egg roll with an entree so that's what we did.

I'm no curry expert by any means but I've had better curry at Thai places previously but I wasn't disappointed at all.  I could have taken more rice but in the end it turned out to be just enough.

My buddy went safe and had the orange chicken which he said was just fine and he'd also return.

It's not a really nice place so no worries there, but not dirty at all, just kind of quick sit down and eat type place.. wooden chair booths but plenty of seating for a lot if you had a group.  Ladies were very nice and food came up fairly quick.

I'll go again and try another item on their menu and hopefully will be just as good or better.

Oh and they have Diet Dr Pepper, which is awesome... just sayin."}
{"text":"The food is good but some workers there are doing you a favor that they even wants to serve food to you. 
Smile guys it's free."}
{"text":"I was in the Tempe, AZ area earlier this week for work. Because my company considers traveling time as part of the work hours, by the time we landed and picked up a car, it was 11 am. Time for lunch.  My boss contacted his counterpart to let us know that we would be meeting up at Savor Flavor Asia.  Cool! Asian food for lunch. Looking good so far.

Damn GPS in these car rentals had us going around and around trying to find the restaurant.  I finally had to use Google map's street view to figure out where the heck the restaurant was. So we finally found it a block from the main street as the shopping plaza is over a 2 block area.

I get the concept of the restaurant. They provide a variety of the common Asian dishes for Japenese, Thai, Chinese and Vietnamese cuisine. And because it has some of my favorites listed, it took a few minutes to figure out what I wanted.

During this visit, I ordered the Katsu Don while my boss ordered the Chicken Curry.  My boss was warned that the spice level for the curry is 4 out of 5 and there is no substituting that. As my boss loves hot spices, he was very happy to hear that.

Now at the register, the veteran employee was training a newbie.

As my boss and I sat down and waited for our food, we of course struck up a conversation with my co-workers already chowing down.  In a reasonable amount of time, the newbie delivered our lunch.  My lunch looked more like chicken katsu rather than katsu don. As I asked the newbie, he confirmed it was what I ordered.  I took his word for it as I understand that sometimes restaurants will make things differently from what one is accustomed to. So I began to dig in and took a couple of bites. I thought that the katsu was good, along with the katsu sauce and the fried rice.  Oops! This is not what I ordered as I distinctly remembered that I ordered white rice. And my boss realized, he didn't order teriyaki chicken but curry chicken. So at least those two dishes were good.

We took our food back to the counter to let them know that the order was incorrect and unfortunately, we ate some of it.

We get back to our seats and within 2-minutes our correct orders were delivered.

Now Katsu Don is a little bit on the saucier side and is either a pork or chicken katsu mixed with eggs and onions. Normally, Katsu Don will come in a bowl so that the sauce can marinate into the rice. Unfortunately, my dish came on a plate and was a little too saucy for me. So instead of the sauce being on and through the rice, it was all over my plate. So my dish was okay. \"Can I get the incorrect order back please?\"

My boss also commented that his chicken curry was just okay. He felt that the spicy level of the curry was more a 2 rather than a 4.

Now for the atmosphere, nice, clean and modern decor.

And although our order came to us incorrect, I still think the customer service was great. In time, the newbie will be far better familiar with the dishes.

I do look forward to coming back because I do want to try the other dishes available.  Additionally, as I'm learning my way around the Phoenix, Tempe, Awatuke area, i find that I like the Awatuke neighborhood the best.

Sorry, no pictures of food while I'm work traveling as I really don't want to hear it from my co-workers or boss. I work with construction people. So I know the ribbing would be off the charts."}
{"text":"The pho here does not taste like pho.  This is real bland and there is very little meat in it.  Lots of noodles but less broth and meat."}
{"text":"I lived this resteraunt for years. They changed owners recently and the food has suffered. I used to eat here once a week or more. After this last time I will not be returning. Not at all like it used to be. No pride in the food."}
{"text":"Love this place! Fresh, delicious, great prices. You will never have a bad meal here!!! A+++++"}
{"text":"First time customer. I got the Korean Ramen and it was delicious! The flavor was amazing. The noodles were a little thicker and denser than I normal eat with ramen, however it still seemed to fit. 

The atmosphere for lunch was nice and quiet so it was easy to enjoy my meal. 

The only downside, which really isn't a fault on the establishment, just the workers, was the two girls running the front counter talked about all the gossip from the local high school every minute I was there except for the 2 minute interactions when a customer walked up to order, then they just jumped back into conversation."}
{"text":"The food was edible.  OK at best.  Was not worth going out of your way to get but if you are going to the movies next door and your cravings some Asian food then perhaps this place is for you.  I ordered food for the family of five.   No one was happy with the food but it filled their stomachs."}
{"text":"Years and years ago this place used to be pretty damn good and now it's about even with fast food if that"}
{"text":"We were very happy with our food. The crab puffs were amazing!! The chicken in our meals were good quality, unlike many other Chinese delivery we've had in the past. They delivered in about an hour which was expected. The pot stickers were not the best. Thats the only thing. I think we were expecting more dumplings and they were fried."}
{"text":"LOVE this place!  Their Thai Iced tea rocks!  Prices are reasonable, everything is made fresh to order, and you may custom order anything off the menu!  They have gluten free menus, and tons of items for vegetarians (me) and meat eaters too (my family).

Tons of cooks in the back to prepare your meal exactly the way you want it.  So tired of some restaurants which tell me what they CAN'T do, since portion of meals are premade, or if you want it special, they will cost you \"extra.\"

Mgr. is a breathe of fresh air, energetic, always there to make recommendations, and she even buses the tables.

MUCH better quality than Pei Wei.  We will be back, and have been back OFTEN!

If you haven't been there, GO, and visit often!

For our family their promo of 3 entrees for $23 with 3 egg rolls rocks it!"}
{"text":"We ordered food here last night thinking it would be decent food for delivery and not were we wrong. I am never one to call and complain or someone who sends food back, but with spending $44.00 there was no way I couldn't say something. We ordered there special of 3 entrees that came with rice and egg rolls, crab puffs and Vietnamese coffee and sadly on 3 things weren't burnt. The crab puffs were ok, the white rice was fine and I still haven't had the coffee. Everything else was burnt and I mean burnt, the egg rolls were borderline black, the beef was burnt to a crips, the chicken seemed like it was sitting out all day then reheated to be burnt and even the lo mein was burnt. I've had over cooked noodles, but never burnt. We also paid the extra for the \"specialty\" lo mein and the shrimp I kid you not was the size of a dime and the chicken was no bigger than a nickel. Extremely disappointed, I couldn't even eat my dinner as hungry as I was. My boyfriend will eat almost anything and felt the same way.

We called to complain, again something I hate doing and the manager said he'd offer a refund but we'd have to contact Eat24. We contacted them and they were extremely helpful. They called the store and the manager told them he'd only offer a partial refund if they could pick it up. At the point I was beyond annoyed and told them to pick it up, which they never did and took the partial refund. 

I'm seeing other reviews so maybe it was a really bad night for them, but the food was far from decent. I don't know if the cook was stoned and not paying attention or what the deal was, but I'll never order form here again unfortunately."}
{"text":"Wow delicious, fresh, healthy, and moderately priced!  This place is a winner in my book.  I had the chicken pad Thai gluten free which was tasty and not spicy but flavorful.  Really enjoyable.  Husband had Basil Beef which was spicy but delicious.  Excellent portion sizes and friendly staff.  We'll definitely be back.  We stopped in before seeing a movie.  My husbands dish was lunch size with rice and salad whereas mine was regular portion.

Bonus ran in to two friends who had the same dish as my husband which they have frequently."}
{"text":"Savor Flavor has quickly become my new favorite place in Ahwatukee. Everything here is phenomenal. The spring rolls, which are hand-rolled to order, taste fresh; the sauces are all made by hand daily; and their entrees are filling and thoroughly delicious, easily hearkening back to their pan-asian roots. The atmosphere is as clean and refreshing as the food and the staff is extremely friendly and enthusiastic, all of which comes together for a truly excellent dining experience!"}
{"text":"Don't ever expect it fast or timely typically wait excessively (20-40 min) for okay food (soup to go). Don't come here unless you have nothing else planned."}
{"text":"Sort of mediocre, overall.
Got take out. Restaurant is really clean, staff is really really nice. My food was ready by the time I got there, although they were busy so I had to wait a bit, but the girl working the counter was really courteous about it.
Unfortunately, the food was just mediocre. We had a few different dishes, and they were all just mediocre. Potstickers - fine. Lo Mein - fine, sort of boring (but not expecting anything too exciting from Lo Mein). Friend had Moo Goo Gai Pain, which she really liked. Overall I have had worse, but there is also better, and better in the area.
I would try them again sometime, some different dishes, since they are close and the employees are really nice."}
{"text":"Chicken lettuce wraps were sooo good!! They have a great menu with gluten free and vegan options if you're into that."}
{"text":"Food at Savor Flavor is not bad but the prices are definitely high for their taste! The place is always clean, which is one of the reasons that we keep coming back here! Their delivery service is extremely slow. Ever time we call for delivery the estimated time is 60 min, luckily we live very close and are able to pick up."}
{"text":"I came in here for lunch today and was not expecting much of anything as it just looks like a regular, Chinese fast food place. I ended up having the best Sesame Chicken I've ever had before. It was perfectly crispy on the outside and tender and savory on the inside. Delicious. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I honestly was not expecting much when I ordered online, but was pleasantly surprised at how tasty the food turned out. From the time I ordered (Saturday night) to my first bite, the entire process took approximately 35 minutes.  My food order consisted of Kung Pao Shrimp, Lemon Chicken and a side of Lo Mein and White Rice. All delicious in their own right! Would definitely recommended this place for a quick Chinese-American food fix."}
{"text":"We went with a large group and we all walked away satisfied with our unique orders. Kid's noodle order was a winner with our 4-yr-old. We had a lot of young children in our group and we didn't get weird looks from staff or anyone else so that alone was a win for me  would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This is our new go to for delivery. We love the gluten free menu, really accommodates our family. We love the GF sweet and sour chicken, pad thai, and fried rice. They also have a three for $23 deal we like to use, includes egg rolls that are not gf. We love ordering from here. Just tried the Korean soup tonight for the first time, and it was another hit."}
{"text":"If you want a small, diluted, unflavorful, $9 bowl of Pho, this is the place for you! Their other food is decent but still overpriced.  There are better alternatives around the valley.  The staff was decently friendly."}
{"text":"Horrible...disappointed to say the least. After waiting almost 2 hours for our food to be delivered we called to speak with a manager. A girl by the name of Hannah spoke with us who claimed to be the manager. We love their food, but after the conversation with this so called \"manager\", we will never order or refer anyone to this place. She was very condescending and rude and even argued with us. This is a true representation on how this place is run. A simple apology would have been enough, instead we were treated as if we did something wrong. Never again."}
{"text":"Remnants of Vietnamese egg rolls that were light and super delicious. Unfortunately this place is painfully slow. After waiting 20 minutes for our food we had to change to a to go order. Ten minutes later we are still waiting. Tables were not being cleaned after customers left. Not sure if we will try this place again us I haven't even been able to taste the bulk of our food. . Also it's a bit overpriced."}
{"text":"My hubby and I decided to try a new Asian restaurant and we ran into this gem and we love it! The prices are good for the portion they serve you and it tastes soooo amazing! They also offer gluten free foods if you're interested in a similar restaurant. Will come back always!"}
{"text":"I ordered this on GrubHub for my friends and I and the food was delicious! It was delivered quick and it was easy. The staff who delivered my food was really nice! I will definitely be back. Yummy!"}
{"text":"Great customer service.  The food was hot and freshly made.  I liked it and will be back soon."}
{"text":"Yum!  I love that you have a gluten-free section on your menu.  I ordered take out for Beef Pho Soup today.  It hit the spot.  Thanks so much I will definitely order again :)"}
{"text":"Restaurant interior is clean and attractive. Service was average. 

We ordered the chicken chow mein and orange chicken with brown rice and a drink, all for take out. The staff apparently gave our order to a different guest because we received an order with chicken chow mein, orange chicken with white rice, and spring rolls. The price difference was about $0.20 less than what we paid, and although not a huge amount of money, I prefer to get what I pay for. 

The food itself was below average. The chicken chow mein was bland. The chicken wasn't cooked poorly, but was certainly nothing to rave about. The spring rolls had more flavor than the chicken chow mein, but the sauce was a prepackaged sweet and sour sauce. I guess for 2.99 per 2 rolls I expected a little more. The orange chicken had better flavor than both the spring rolls and the chow mein, but the breading tasted like it had been fried in over-used oil. Most restaurants don't cook with high-heat stable oils and the batch should be changed regularly. Apparently Neo Tokyo doesn't extend this courtesy to their customers. 

The incorrect and more expensive order, and the low quality, poorly seasoned food will keep me from returning here."}
{"text":"I keep hearing good things about Neo Tokyo and have driven by it way to many times. I went for lunch the restaurant was empty well waiting for my food I saw everyone was getting take out. The staff was really friendly the restaurant really clean... I ordered the lunch combo #1 Teriyaki Chicken with brown rice I also ordered the 3pcs Shrimp Tempura. The Chicken was pretty good for the price without the hot chili sauce it would have been a D- The shrimp Tempura was not crispy on the outside it was soggy that makes it a D- as well. I will not be going back for lunch anytime soon."}
{"text":"First time for me.  The restaurant was clean and tastefully decorated.  I was greeted before I even reached the counter.  There was a large offering, and I selected the Crispy Orange Beef as a lunch combo ($6.79 I believe).  I was very pleased!  Generous portion of beef and a side of fresh broccoli that had a nice snap to it.  The fried rice was also very good.  The new owner also stopped by and asked how my experience was.  Overall I was very satisfied and will come back next week when I'm on that side of town.  

Also, this is a family run restaurant.   I always like supporting local business!"}
{"text":"Quick service before a movie that is yummy and has something for all taste buds ! I tried the Thai Basil Rice with chicken and it was lovely. My friends raved about their noodles and Orange Chicken. The average meal was about $8 without a drink.
I actually was upset that I did not have more appetite.  Better than normal fragranced rice and the noodles were perfectly seasoned, i found myself wanting to eat a little out of everyone else's plate.
Come here before a show and you really wont ever want popcorn in a movie again!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed some excellent orange chicken.  Was pleased to hear that it's the same owners as the former Neo Tokyo,"}
{"text":"The first few orders for delivery were pretty good.  Then they started quickly going down hill.  Delivery much longer, food was completely cold and quality went down significantly. Won't order takeout or delivery here again.  Do not make a mistake by ordering here. There are so many good place and the quality here is really poor."}
{"text":"I've been eating at Neo Tokyo for over 10 years.

Whether it was before or after a movie, wanting some take-out after work; heck, sure I went on a few awkward teenage dates here. It's always a great choice. 

While Neo Tokyo has evolved over the years, the food has remained consistently delicious. 

You walk up to the counter, order, and put a number on your table. 

I can usually get out of here for $8 or less if I'm alone. 

Some of my favorites:

1) Orange Chicken - Great spices in the sauce, add the chili oil to it and it's out of this world
2) Teriyaki Chicken Bowl - Quality meat, no mystery meat to be found here
3) Sweet and Sour Pork 

What's cool about Neo Tokyo is you can get fusion dishes, from Thai, to Korean, to Japanese. 

I'm looking forward to trying the Dan Dan Noodles and Chicken Lettuce Wraps. 

Don't forget to check-in on Yelp for a free Egg Roll or Crab Puff.

Stop by for a quick bite before a movie at AMC, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I'm on my \"Showgirls\" diet which includes brown rice, vegetable and evian. Surprisingly, I got all of that at Neo Tokyo, with some chicken as well. 
We stopped by for lunch, and enjoyed fresh food at a very decent price. The lunch special was $6.50 and came with a spring roll. The guy working was friendly and offered some recommendations. 

I don't hang out in this part of town much, but if I'm in that part of town in the near future, I'd stop by here again without a doubt."}
{"text":"Neo Tokyo was surprising good for a fast food type restaurant.  We stopped in after a movie for a quick bite.  The orange chicken was our favorite.  The chicken was moist and crispy with an orange sauce that is not too sweet.  I love the sticky, chewy brown rice."}
{"text":"Don't bother eating here!  This place has gone downhill.... our whole experience from the beginning was sub par.  Four of us dined in the \" restaurant\" and had similar experience with the rude cashier.  Each of our meals, which were all different, were cold and disgusting.  None of us finished our food and simply threw away.  Will never return!"}
{"text":"Great food and friendly service. A nice change from the standard Chinese fare. Food is fresh and tasty, varied menu and constantly upgrading their offerings.  You can tell the owner is passionate about his restaurant.  We typically order out every week and have tried many different Asian type of restaurants and this is by far the best"}
{"text":"This place has a subpar menu, its just not very appealing to try some of the more adventurous stuff. I stuck to the tried and true teriyaki chicken. It really isn't very amazing here, its ok. If you're near the theatre, want to grab a quick bite before the show, and you are really craving some asian food, you could give it a try. Otherwise I'd just go elsewhere.

Staff is not very friendly at this place, I imagine its family run, but they seem like they could care less if you could eat here. I really don't like places like this that think they'll stay in business just because they got an awesome location. Aside from the person who takes your order, doesn't smile, and doesn't really say a word there is no service to rate here. The food isn't terrible, it just isn't amazing."}
{"text":"The food is really good and they are always busy. Plus they deliver which is awesome because I only had to get out of the hot tub to answer the door."}
{"text":"Food here is fantastic. The price point beats other places of the same quality, and the menu is incredibly diverse. Ticket times are quick for how great the food is too! This is now my go to place for Asian food in Ahwatukee."}
{"text":"I've ordered from here several times and the food is always delicious. Especially the Wonton Soup and Orange Chicken. The delivery is fast and the employees are always super friendly!!"}
{"text":"First visit. Not sure why we hadn't stopped in when it was Neo Tokyo. Maybe the new name caught our attention.

Overall we were pleasantly surprised with the kind, prompt service and friendly conversation with the owners. The staff seemed to enjoy what they do, too.

The food was good. We will be back to try several other menu items. We were also pleased to learn of the expanding menu - more delicious goodness to bring us back later.

Definitely worth stopping in if you would like good food at a fair price and friendly service."}
{"text":"This is a great place for lunch or dinner. The owners are super nice and really take care of their regular customers. We just had them cater a house party for 30. They delivered and set up at our house. Our guests really enjoyed the flavor"}
{"text":"Came here with my friend for lunch one day. Not much to say, its fast food Asian style. It's not bad and I'd try them again. But Rubio's is next door and quite tempting...lol. The inside is clean and people were nice but the food was kind of so-so, it's quite forgettable. So if I remember I guess I can try them again."}
{"text":"These lovely folks did a catering event for us. They are the only gluten-free sweet and sour chicken that I know about. It's fabulous. Great portion sizes. Really fresh. We had the chicken, stir fry, rice and fried rice, and salad rolls. Fabulous! Totally recommend."}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice. Their Pho is okay but they don't have the large, wide spoons to eat with so you have to use a regular metal spoon. That's a little irksome. I got Kung Pao chicken the second time and was really disappointed. There were no red peppers that Kung Pao always has and it wasn't spicy at all. It was also greasy. I will probably give this place another try but get something that isn't supposed to be spicy."}
{"text":"the only reason i'm giving them 3 stars is because the food is actually decent. however, the service is absolutely terrible. one day i ordered the spicy chicken lo mein for delivery and it came and it wasn't spicy. i immediately called within 5 mins after the guy left my door. the associate i spoke to  had a horrible attitude and basically kept saying the ticket never said spicy and that's not their problem. after awhile of me arguing with him about customer service he panicked and gave me to the manager. the manager then informed me there was nothing they could do because the delivery driver had already been relieved. long story short i had to physically bring in my receipt and the noodles for them to just make me new noodles as i didn't want a refund i just wanted spicy noodles! they obviously didn't understand that. i'm shocked they stay open treating customers like that. i was sick that day and had to get ready and waste my time and gas driving over for their mistake! it sucks because i love their food but will probably never go back and i tell everyone about my experience, so i'm spreading the word. they need to fix their customer service. i've been in the service industry for 6 years and you never blame your mistakes on a customer!"}
{"text":"The worst food ever!!!!! This was a delivered order. We ordered crab puffs, they were over cooked, actually dark brown/BURNT and NO CRAB, just cream cheese and didn't include nearly enough sweet and sour sauce. Next was the crispy pot stickers, wow, they weren't kidding with the word crispy. They were very over cooked, dry, bland and dark brown/BURNT. Then came the edamame, very rubbery! Seemed like all our appetizers were precooked and then recooked several times when they needed them. We also ordered orange chicken which arrived with VERY little sauce and SOGGY! I don't get it. All the item that were over cooked shouldn't have but the orange chicken that you want crispy, arrives soggy. The only thing that was done right was the prepackaged fortune cookies. Didn't even include napkins or utensils. CLASSLESS!!!!!! BIG WASTE OF MONEY!!!! Go to Panda Garden @ 48th & Warner instead. Much better food with owners who actually care about how their food is served! Foolish mistake on my part. NEVER AGAIN!!!! They will be out of business soon. Look at all their bad reviews in the last 90 days. DESPERATE and trying to survive their horrible food and crappy service!!!!"}
{"text":"Looks like a food to go place. Order at cashier and wait for food. Not exactly a Asian feel for an Asian Restaurant. Did appreciate the \"Gun And Roses\" playing on the speaker though. 

Ordered PHO. $9 bowl gave me 4 slices of beef... and that's it. Go Americanize Pho it wasn't too bad, but $9 and the only meat you get is 4 slices of beef? Really? I don't really post... but hope his helps the owner realize that if you're going to represent Vietnamese Pho give the customer The right experience being that it's a beef soup add some meat."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good but most importantly, it doesn't make me sick.  That may not seem huge but it is.  Every restaurant says they don't use MSG but I magically get sick when I eat Asian food.  I tried 5 different apps and a lunch and nothing goofed up my stomach.  I'm super happy and will come here all the time!"}
{"text":"I came here on Christmas day to eat after catching a movie at the theatre next door.  I was starving, and theres only so many options one person has in regards to dining out on such a holiday.

The menus pretty boring, standard issue chinese.  Limited options, and a fast casual dining experience for service.  I don't think it was bad...just nothing really exciting here, and kind of has a boring feel to it.  I'm just glad that they were open to eat at during xmas day.

Food was okay, nothing exciting.  I went with the sweet and sour chicken with brown rice, and I got plenty of food for the $9.29 I paid.  Sadly, they serve everything on plastic, including the baby fork that came with my food.    Why cant I get real lifesize adult siverware here?  I swear the fork was meant for a 2 year old!  

Of all the chinese places I've eat at, this was surely one of them.  Nothing memorable, but nothing so horrid that Im scarred for life.  Dont expect to much when eating here...."}
{"text":"We can find a variety of dishes from different Asian origins here. Chinese, Thai, Vietnamese. And they know how to apply only the goods. Stir-fried noodle is not greasy, spring rolls come with very good sauce, Thai milk tea looks pretty and not too sweet. Chicken lettuce wrap is perfect. But beef noodle soup (pho) needs more flavors. Maybe because Im personally used to my mom's kitchen where we cook pho every week at home, so maybe you would like it. Service was prompt and friendly enough. 
They offer one crab puff or one egg roll for free with purchase of $7 or more. But remember to redeem it before you get to the register because once you've paid for the food, they wont accept it. I purchased a $50+ lunch but got denied for one egg roll because i found the offer only after i settled down at the table waiting for our food."}
{"text":"This is my go to place to get the best chicken Pad Thai! Also the price is super good, considering most places have high prices and poor quality. Love this place, its definitely a top 5 fav for take out."}
{"text":"Wow, this was easily some of the worst Panang Beef I've ever had. The curry sauce was thin, runny, and poorly seasoned. There were few vegetables in this curry, and the beef was exceptionally tough. Yuck! To add insult to injury, this plate-o-barf was overpriced -rest assured I will never set foot in this place again."}
{"text":"Delicious food and convenient! Big variety on menu which meets everyone's cravings. Very nice and helpful staff."}
{"text":"Bland general tso chicken.  They sprinkle some red pepper flakes on their orange chicken. It comes with onions, broccoli and dry rice.  Picture attached.  Rice seemed to have been sitting awhile. $7.99 was too much, yet I know they are paying high retail rent.

The chicken terryiki was just ok.

It's unimpressive."}
{"text":"Our new favorite Asian fusion place! Workers are so nice, food is awesome! My only complaint is that the spicy isn't very spicy. The flavor is so delicious though!"}
{"text":"Very good food, decent portion sizes, fairly pricey but I would recommend if you are looking for some good asian food!"}
{"text":"I came here with my girlfriend and spent 30$ on two people how expensive especially when your main entree comes out cold to the bite. The Vietnamese Eggrolls were cold as hell. What a waste of money and time. Stay away, there are many better places near by !!"}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible! Everytime we get takeout from here something is missing how hard is it to put the rice in the bag??? Now we have a plate of chicken with no side whatsoever and my girlfriend is cooking her own rice and all the kid did on the phone was laugh and say we will get you next time absolutely terrible food sucks too just thought we would give it a try since they changed their name but still same owner and terrible food and"}
{"text":"Food is below average- overly breaded and extremely bland. Don't bother, there is better Chinese in Ahwatukee. Try Great Wok instead."}
{"text":"They deliver to my office so I figured I'd give them a shot. I tried their egg drop soup and chicken teriyaki - both were delicious. I have yet to visit their location but it's on my list."}
{"text":"This place has good flavorful food. My wife and I had Thai curry chicken and the teriyaki chicken and both were real good. I didn't care for the chicken fried rice but my wife liked it. We will order from here again."}
{"text":"When this place first opened, the chicken fried rice was amazingly garlic filled and so flavorful. Idk who complained but I hate you. The spicy Korean Kimchi is really good, great egg roles, great crab puffs, lo mein and yakisoba are awesome. I haven't tried the Pho yet, but it's next on my list!"}
{"text":"Looking at the pictures, the food looks good. Stopped here after the movies and ordered a few different things. It wasn't anything Asian at all. Lacks flavor. Sauces weren't tasty. Actually all of us had bad stomach ache afterwards. Yukk to everything we tried. Never going back.
It was weird how while sitting in the booth, they brought our food out one by one, so the rest of us had to wait a while for everyone's food to be cooked. 
Wontons were only good experience."}
{"text":"I'm so mixed on this place. The food is always good, but the service varies wildly. I've ordered using the Eat24 app and had my food here within 20 minutes. I've also ordered, waited an hour, and gotten a call from Eat 24 saying no matter what they did they could not reach the restaurant - so no food, and they charged me. Recently, I called in to order (because of the Eat 24 issue) and said I would be paying cash. I asked for them to bring $10 change. The driver only had $4 on him. It's really frustrating when you tell them in advance how much change you need and they still can't pull it off. But hey, the delivery driver got a hell of a tip. 

I'd love to this place to change management and get their act together. If they could consistently provide good service, they would absolutely be 5 stars. The food is always good. Their pad thai is tasty and not spicy. The ginger beef is delicious and the beef is tender, not chewy like most chinese restaurants. The lemon chicken, curry, and cashew chicken are all delicious. The portions are also nice - I usually get a solid meal and leftovers from a single order.

Update on 7/1 - The food wasn't great last time I ordered. The walnut shrimp was half the usual portion and very little sauce, it looked like leftovers from the night before. Considering how awful their service is, it's not worth ordering from them unless the food is damn good. They also would not honor the Yelp deal they advertise for a free sampler with a check in + like on fb. I'm removing a star. I order from them all the time, I should be getting great service."}
{"text":"Really expected better food after seeing 4 stars. Do people in Ahwatukee not know real Chinese/Asian food??
The crab puffs were good. The shrimp tempura was a JOKE! 3 teeny tiny  shrimp, mushy coating, for $5.00!
Rip off.
The crispy beef was anything but, and so tough I ended up chewing the flavor (which WAS good), and spiting out the jerky-like mass after.
THIS for 21.00
Do not bother!!!
Head to Mr. Chao's Asian Bistro right around corner on Chandler Blvd. Or Pei-Wei for that matter. Panda... Anyplace but here!!!"}
{"text":"First time trying this place out, it's clean,  cool and tasty.   I'm glad I made it in and will be back.   They have a good menu with a nice variety of choices!"}
{"text":"Kind of pricey for the amount of food you get. The items sounded great on the menu but I could not get a combination that seemed to work for me. Thinking that teriyaki would be a good choice it was nothing like I had in the past at all. The sauce was orange and did not taste like teriyaki at all. I asked if they were sure it was teriyaki I was told I received exactly what I asked for, I gave 3 stars for the service and it seemed like others were enjoying it. So who am I? It was not to my liking and I won't be returning there anytime soon."}
{"text":"I placed a takeout order and brought exact change only. I didn't have my wallet on me because I had exact change. When I got there the total was 5 dollars more than I was told over the phone. The manager came over and commented how  $5 was a lot to be short and then had the nerve to say (remember I drove 15 mins to pick it up) \"Can't you just go home and get more money or go to an ATM?\" I work in management and I haved worked in the food industry and that is not what you say to someone when one of your employees makes a mistake. I gave the place two stars because he let me go with the food anyways but of course he should have. I am just baffled a manager would suggest driving an extra thirty minutes back home (I let him know how far I lived) for five dollars because your employee miss stated the price. Lastly, not a huge deal but I asked from lots of extra sweet and sour sauce twice and of course had to go back in to get some as I got two packets for a three entree, two appetizer meal. Inompetence at its finest.  Lastly, the food is only worth 2 stars as it is simply \"just ok,\" if that even."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now, and although the food is serviceable, it's all a bit...bland.   And you better like crappy bro-rock like Creed and Nickleback and Linkin Park, because you're gonna get an inexplicable heapin' earful of it while you eat/wait."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times and I have tried the orange chicken and the chicken lettuce wraps. The portions are huge and entrees include white or brown rice.  If you order it to-go..they use decent containers that actually keep the food hot and fresh until you get home."}
{"text":"The food was great and the methods of ordering the food are excellent. The only reason for the 3 stars is due to the service level offered at the location. Staff was not friendly, they seemed annoyed to be there, and made rude comments about the cooks. It was unfortunate to hear how they criticized the cooks in the back, they too had a lot of opportunities. Unfortunately that's not professional and it makes the customers wonder about their order and how it was cooked."}
{"text":"It's been a long time since I've eaten at Neo Tokyo. It's got a different owner now and a different cook, I think.

My old favorite was Kung Pao Chicken, so I ordered it. Surprise! The Kung Pao Chicken didn't taste like what it used to - it taste like Orange Chicken! It's sweet, barely spicy. So, I asked if somehow they got the order mixed up. Staff said \"different restaurants taste different\" and offered to fix it. Well, it didn't get fix. It still tasted sweet with the same sauce and all that was done was to add more spice to it. Well, I was just too hungry to complain any further. Besides, I sometimes do eat Orange Chicken, so I let it pass.

I've been to a lot Chinese restaurants and it's only in Neo Tokyo that I have encountered sweet, barely spicy Kung Pao... too Americanized for my taste.

Not going to eat there anymore."}
{"text":"I believe I  had eaten here once before.  It was just as I expected.  Very clean, counter service. Clean interior.  Prices are decent for fast Asian Fusion Food.  They have pictures on the wall that show exactly what you are getting.  Approximately 32 dishes. From Korean, Japanese, Thai to Chinese.  Reminds me somewhat of a food court type of restaurant.  During the week they have lunch specials.  Probably get better deals then.  We were here on a Saturday and prices were a bit high for what this place is.  I had the sesame chicken rice bowl with white rice (you have a choice of brown or white) with lots of chicken a couple of pieces of green and red pepper.  I believe I counted 3 pieces.  Little bit stingy.  Another person had the Pad Thai, and a Katsui chicken.  It's, clean, fast service, decent food."}
{"text":"I've only ordered the orange crispy beef, but it's really good. The fried rice is also really good too. Wife likes the wonton soup and said the Pho is pretty good too. Gets busy so plan ahead."}
{"text":"Hidden gem next to the Ahwatukee movie theatre. Found it when we were Google mapping the area. Probably  the best Asian food in the area, plus they deliver and are open on Sundays. This was a weekly steeple for us when we lived in Ahwatukee. 

The Orange Chicken is to die for. The fried rice is not your typical white rice crud you can buy from the neighborhood corner Panda restaurant. Their rangoons and egg rolls are also top notch for Arizona. 

Overall, Neo Tokyo is a great find and place to eat. Truthfully, this is the first time we've been inside the restaurant and it's a chill, updated atmosphere. Would highly recommend eating here."}
{"text":"Gave this place a second try, staff was friendly and kind both times, but food was subpar at best. We are a family who loves all kinds of Asian food so we really wanted to like this place.  The kicker today was getting served fried spring rolls that were still very cold in the middle and quite soggy then a few moments later were were given a stack of plates one of which was very dirty.  There is no garbage can or station to throw away dirty items, we had a spill and after looking around, we hand the soiled napkins to the same person behind the counter who brought us our food moments later. Im not a picky eater and make the most out of anything, but out of the six items I've tried (we all shared our various entrees/family style) the orange chicken was the only thing I'd ever order a second time. They were out of their Vietnamese Pho soup by 1 pm....they have lots of dishes that *look* good, but something definitely  needs to change with their process or management.  If you must go, order the orange chicken and you should be safe, but don't expect your food to be very warm either."}
{"text":"A wonderful experience the The vegetables were very fresh as well as the meat!everything was expertly seasoned I love Asian food and eat it often and this is the best I have had, in a very long time! Do yourself a favor, it's worth the wait for freshly cooked food!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful staff here. Food is light and fresh, not overly seasoned or greasy. They were also very accommodating with my many order requests and restrictions."}
{"text":"save your favorite is a good place to go, they have family deals that are very inexpensive, its 3 entrees and an appetizers for about 25 dollars highly recommend"}
{"text":"I ordered the Spring Rolls and Chicken Pad Thai. They're very fresh tasty and delicious that I love it. I strongly recommend for everyone to go there try it. Hopefully, Chi Ngan will have more of the Vietnamese dishes coming soon. Definitely I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"This is my favorite go-to Asian Fusion restaurant in Tempe. The food is great and affordable! They deliver and the staff are always friendly and accommodating. It is a quiet undiscovered gem for some but all should go! If not you are truly missing out. The Pho is AMAZING. Asian Spicy wings are addictive and delicious with the right amount of spicy bite.  The Vietnamese BBQ Pork and Rice Noodle is one of my favorites!!! The Asian Shrimp is absolutely delectable. It's a great place to dine in, especially right before or after going to the movies down the block. It's also a great place to get delivery. The food is always delivered quickly. Hot and on time. Definitely give yourself a treat and visit this great place. You'll return again and again. My wife and I did. So glad that we discovered it."}
{"text":"Yuck! I'm a vegetable and fish eater. I ordered the shirmp friend rice, vegetable chop suey (no onions), shirmp broccoli, and house fried rice (for my boyfriedn). I have never eaten at a Asian resturant and they served salad shrimp in their dishes. What!! This place is stingy & cheap. The  pictures on the wall are deceiving!"}
{"text":"This place has a larger menu and delivers to Ahwatukee. I had high hopes but the food was sub par and expensive. I'd much rather go across the freeway and hit Pei Wei or other options then spend the same money for inferior food."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best China food I've had in Phoenix so far. Tastes and feels fresh. My favorite is the Crispy Orange Beef. Exactly right. The only thing I wish was different is that the Hot and Sour soup in not strong enough. It tastes like they took egg drop soup and made it spicy. Everything wise had been great!"}
{"text":"We went there looking for a good Asian restaurant. We definitely found one in this restaurant. Prices are very reasonable, the portions are large, food is excellent tasting. Service is very good. We will definitely be returning and highly recommend."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place. We hadn't been here in years, back when it was still neo Tokyo. We came in for lunch and I wanted the dinner portion of the shrimp and lobster sauce because I was extremely hungry. What came out was smaller than my wife's lunch portion. I asked, is this the dinner portion? \"Yes\" the server replied. Unfortunately for me the food was very good and I thoroughly enjoyed it but I was still hungry! I had to go get a burger on the way home. It was a bummer since the lunch was very expensive. 

In short, it's great Asian food if you're cool with high prices and extremely small portions."}
{"text":"It was really good! The teriyaki chicken with lo mein was perfect! So delicious. The potstickers were really good too. Most places forget to pack the sauces when it's delivery and they gave me a bunch which was appreciated. So good!!"}
{"text":"Where has this place been all my life?! Food was amazing I've never tasted Chinese food like that. We ordered the sampler and orange chicken.  We will definitely be back employees were very courteous and nice."}
{"text":"If you like tasteless food, this is your place.  I really wanted it to be good, but it just isn't.  Fried potstickers were meh (should be pan fried and steamed) and chicken teriyaki was about the same.  I won't be back - it isn't worth wasting the calories."}
{"text":"My coworker and I love love love this restaurant!!! It's hard to find good Chinese food, so when we found this place we were super excited. I love lemon chicken and it's hard to find good lemon chicken because it's either made with chicken pieces that are over battered and all breading and no chicken or the sauce isn't right. This restaurant makes their chicken really good! It's crispy, not overly battered, and the sauce is perfectly sweet and lemony tangy. My coworker gets their Asian shrimp dish and loves it every time. The flavor is awesome, the presentation is great, quantity of their lunch portions are very generous. I love the side salad too. I give this place two thumbs up!!!"}
{"text":"Good selection. They had a POS system glitch on my last visit. Owner was very nice and upgraded my order and added free one on a future visit."}
{"text":"Every time I walk into this place I am reminded of how easily places come and go around Phoenix. This place continues to stay and for good reason. The food is hot and fresh and flavorful. If you want it spicy - you got it. If you don't - you got that too. During the lunch-time rush the food arrives quickly so if you're in a hurry, you're welcome. This place is clean and even my momma (soooo picky) loved it."}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday after the movies. There was a steady amount of customers in there. The perfect amount where it's not crowded but it's not empty. Got two orders of egg rolls and two pho. They have a self-service area to the left of the cashier's area which stocks chopsticks, sauces, and to go boxes. They had three types of tea at their drink station. Tried the passion fruit and it was good. The watermelon, not so much. 

The eggs rolls were okay. Little burnt and they served it with a small amount of lettuce as well as mint.  The pho looked good but the soup lacked flavor. I found myself adding a lot of sauces to try and spruce it up. And more. And more. And more. I couldn't believe how much I had to add.  But I didn't hate it either. So, I can see us going back whenever we watch movies."}
{"text":"This place is the bomb! Great food, great pho. Try the spicy Korean soup. The Service is great and friendly.the food is made from scratch to order. If you're too lazy to come try came person they will deliver the food to you. This is a must try."}
{"text":"The food is ok, and you get quite a bit for the price, but it's nothing to get excited about. I got the pad thai and it was dry. They also served it with a lemon. Everyone knows pad thai is supposed to have lime juice on it, and it isn't very tasty with lemon juice, I have to say.
The fried rice tasted heavily of oil, and I could definitely make it better at home. 
The only redeeming dish that saved this review from being one star is the sesame chicken. It's light and a bit sweet and pretty tasty. It is a bit over-breaded though."}
