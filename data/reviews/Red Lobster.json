{"text":"We went there on our anniversary this year on December 6 th .I was concerned after reading the reviews from different sights .wow! We're we happy we ignored them . excellent service and the food was perfect Miriam( I think was our servers name ) and she was fantastic .I did feel the prices were high or should I say  higher than I want to pay .but the lady has put up with me for 48 yrs.so I think she deserved it .the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is for the prices ."}
{"text":"I went here today for a nice meal. The waiter was great. I asked for my dueling lobster tails to be served without shrimp. The meal was brought out with the shrimp in it. Even though the manager asked me what I needed and apologized, there was no offer to take money off of my meal for the mistake. In addition, I was charged ninety nine cents because of my request. This is not how customers should be treated."}
{"text":"I love their all you can eat shrimp and the lobster  and crab! Every thing is fresh and great every time.  I like going even by myself."}
{"text":"The food are quite decent and the service is great, although it's a little bit pricey."}
{"text":"Cannot make reservations in holidays and weekends.  What's the point ... who needs a reservation on Monday thru Thursday?   gotta laugh at this concept.  :o)"}
{"text":"When I came here back in July for my birthday it's was fairly late maybe 8:30 at the latest we were sat n it literally took us 30 minutes before our waiter came to take our orders! We later found out that he was the bartender and the waiter.  Which is ridiculous the bar had about 5 people sitting there he had to serve n one lady was talking his ears off which took us forever to get our food. That wasn't his fault, it's red lobsters for being cheap and understaffed. That's the reason I took a star off other then that it was an okay visit the waiter was pleasant it just took forever. I also went here last night for the endless shrimp we got there at 9pm. We had an amazing waitress her name was Fabiola. She never let our glasses get empty , she was very nice, and she kept our shrimp coming at a steady pace. Even after 10 when the restaurant was closed she still let us order another dish. When I come back to red lobster I'm defiantly going to ask for her to be my waitress."}
{"text":"Hello I came in a few weeks ago and id have to say the food here is fantastic, although the service is not. My servers were great but the hostess was so rude I did not want to come back. I got her name . Kayla or something like that. She was very disrespectful by not allowing me to sit where I felt was a good spot for my family. Then she decided to yell when I asked for a table instead of a booth. My experience with her makes me not want to come back at all."}
{"text":"This offers the average \"Red Lobster\" experience.  The service is average, the food is average and the decor is like every other \"Red Lobster\".   I don't know what else to say but, if you've ever been to a chain restaurant , this one won't disappoint in that \"experience\"."}
{"text":"The Red Lobster is currently running a menu special where for a mere $18, you can get a full 4 course meal (soup, salad, entree, dessert). We went for a late lunch at 3pm, Saturday, when there wasn't any lineup and it was not busy. We each ordered the special. I had clam chowder, caesar salad, jumbo coconut shrimp with baked potatoe, and chocolate fudge brownie with ice cream. My friend ordered the exact same except her entree was blackened tilapia with a side of broccoli. The salads all come with all you can eat cheese biscuits. To keep our budget in check, we didn't order any cocktails or beer. Just water. Lucky for us, because after the soup and salad and a few biscuits, we couldn't eat our entrees! We each had a couple of forkfuls of our mains and were stuffed! I think it was the biscuits. So we asked the waiter who was very nice, to bring us containers to box up our entrees to go. Then he asked if we wanted to still have our dessert or to box that up too? Ha ha... we totally forgot that we had dessert coming. The chocolate chip sprinkled brownies were served hot with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. We ate the ice cream and had the brownies boxed up too.   Now that I am home and working on my doggie bag, I think the best thing about Red is the service and the ambiance. It is a relatively comfortable downtown space that is not too pricey with pleasant wait staff who don't put pressure on you to order drinks and meal extras, if you don't want it. That and their Cheese biscuits, they were delicious. The soup and salad was ok, the mains we had, I don't recommend."}
{"text":"Highway robbery for a draft!  $5. Restrooms smelled really bad. Shrimp was not hot when brought out the first time."}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible service from our waitress. Waited 25 minutes just for bread. And I can assure you it was not busy at all. Me and my family went in at 10 pm, ordered and everything and wasn't given bread till 10:25 and our food barely came at 10:45. Very disappointed because I usually have a great experience but this time, not so much."}
{"text":"Visiting friends yesterday in Phoenix (we're from Porter Ranch, CA) and we decided to visit this Red Lobster and what a GREAT decision that turned out to be.  Unfortunately for us, we have no Red Lobster close to the Porter Ranch area.  (Hint, hint, you guys could build one in Porter Ranch; you'd do fantastic business here!)  So now back to my review!   First, before we arrived, we called and asked if we could have a table on the patio as we had our dog and didn't want to leave him in the car.  Although they don't \"normally\" seat for lunch on the patio at this time of year, no problem said the manager; we'd love to have you come over.  The table was completely set up when we arrived.  Then, our server, Heather, was an incredible server.  Totally attentive, getting our every need!  We all had a good laugh when we asked if she minded us being so needy!  She said she loved it!  And, she didn't overdo it!  So total thumbs up to Heather and the manager, whose name I unfortunately did not get.  Now, the important stuff.  The food!  It was absolutely delicious!  The portions were perfect for lunch and actually, too much, to be perfectly honest.  But don't reduce portions on my account.  We're retired and don't eat heavily.  So we had food left.  But, it was so delectable and truly mouth watering!     My husband and our friend had the lobster bisque.  They loved it, describing it as flavorful and savory; it smelled so yummy.  Our friend also had the stuffed baked potato (stuffed with lobster and shrimp, I believe), which he raved about.  His wife had the fettucine alfredo with shrimp, which she described as creamy and delicious.  I had the sailor's platter....flounder, fried shrimp and shrimp scampi, baked potato, salad and those scrumptious cheese biscuits.  OMG.....they were delish!  I loved, loved, loved the flounder, roasted so beautifully and again, yummy, yummy, yummy!  Kudos to the chef and kitchen staff of this Red Lobster.  You all do your company proud!      Thanks to all for the great time!  We will definitely return when we come back to Phoenix!"}
{"text":"The worst service I've ever received in my life I honestly wanted to leave before I even got my meal. The service put others before us well that wouldn't be true cause they completely forgot about us."}
{"text":"Decent seafood at a good price. Cheap drinks, kid friendly, an east choice - a fave!"}
{"text":"4/5!  I really never have a bad experience at this location (mind you, I've never been to another Red location), but it was awesome. This restaurant is definitely a family favourite!  We were a party of four and went around 7pm and we were seated within 10 minutes. Once seated, we were greeted by a very kind, young waitress for drinks and shortly, she came back for our main orders. We were really indecisive with our orders because we wanted to make a few switches but all throughout, she was very patient and extremely helpful. Three of us got the Lobster trio (with different side orders and quite large portions) and one of us got the lobster and shrimp bake (cooked with butter and white wine and the portion is pretty big). Three of us got caesar salads to go with our meals and one of us ordered lobster soup (extra charge but after tasting it, you'll wanna pay for it lol). And of course, their infamous biscuits (they're literally the greatest biscuits you will ever taste.....think a classier and more elegant version of the Popeye's biscuits).  Around the time we were eating our main meals, a big party came in and our waitress was helping them as well so we completely understood and were pretty patient with our bills, etc but she was still on top of her game and did everything in good time. We cleaned up our table and piled the plates on top of each other just to give her a head start and she really appreciated it so she gave us an extra bag of biscuits to take home and extra dips (one of us really enjoyed it with their meal.  I always see poor reviews for this location but I've always had awesome experiences and will definitely keep coming back. Recommend :)"}
{"text":"This is your typical Red Lobster. I have always loved the food, and the reason it gets four stars is because I live in Arizona and not in Maine or California. Also, you can get just shrimp or crab, where as the higher end seafood places mix it into some monstrosity of a dinner. And, the biscuits. Amazing. I also like getting my salad on a cold plate, mentally it tells me it's crisp."}
{"text":"Been coming to this location for over 1 year now and the customer service from the hostess and the bar! The food is always great. The only issue I have is with the manager who works swing shift. She lacks people skills and has absolutely no phone etiquette! I was placed on hold by Johnnie at the bar(very nice lady)and the manager picks up yes can I help you...... I'm sorry whit whom am I speaking with??? This will be the absolute last time I order from this restaurant. If the manager speaks to customers this way I can only imagine how she speaks to the employees! This gets one star because of the poor customer service I received from the manager. But the food is good.  No thanks!!!"}
{"text":"Went in last Sunday for dinner to check out the renovations. Wasn't at all what I expected, it's more \"Keg Like\" now. Darker colors.  I think I liked the way it was decorated before better, lots of ocean and harbor charm. Menu was the same, and I got my usual, the Shrimp Trio. Love it. This is the place I go to when I'm craving seafood and want a casual and not to expensive place to go too, because lets face it, with the cheese buns and the salad to start, Red Lobster is a good bang for your buck. Also love their Mango Mai Tai's!"}
{"text":"I was sick for an entire week, after eating here. I had never been to a red lobster before but my friends took me here and the aftermath was horrible. I must have had some kind of shell fish poisoning or something. The sickest Ive ever been. Beware of Red Lobster, specifically this location. Never Ever will I step foot in a red lobster and neither will any of my friends. Since I ate there, I have made sure to tell everyone my story, needless to say none of my friends or family will step foot in a red lobster in the near future. It makes me want to vomit even when I see a red lobster commercial, thats how sick I got from this place. I cant even watch a  damn red lobster commercial."}
{"text":"My husband and I are and have been in the Las Vegas service industry for over 20 yrs.  We try hard to give a good experience every time with a welcoming smile. .  Funny enough, my husband hates seafood but, loves me!  We repeatedly come to the Red Lobster on Flamingo.  Food is fantastic!  Even better, it is so nice to be catered to, the way we cater to others.  Jesus is our favorite server, I'm sure they're all great, we always wait for him.  FIVE STAR SERVICE!"}
{"text":"Yesterday my family and I celebrate my birthday but the waitress  Was a disaster she hit my husband, we wait a lot of Time for food, we spend $ 300 and now my children are very sick I do not recommend this place!  Worse birthday ever!  I can't  believe I was very happy and excited for my birthday but know I'm so desperate!   I'm take my kids 2 the hospital !"}
{"text":"This was the best Red Lobster in the whole Phoenix metro area - food was always good and servers were attentive, friendly, and professional.  Such a shame it closed and Olive Garden next door stayed open.  Of all the restaurants in the Darden chain, Red Lobster is the best by far and Olive Garden is the worst."}
{"text":"Order Ultimate Feast and Fire Lobster. Also mix drink Bahama Mama. Lobster is what you want."}
{"text":"I've eaten hear many times and find the servers to be very friendly. There can be a wait on the weekend evening but that pretty normal. I prefer to go at lunch time whenever possible because it rarely crowded and the food comes out fast. As far as the food goes I'd say its pretty typical for Red Lobster."}
{"text":"I don't know, man.  This Red Lobster just didn't measure up to other Red Lobsters I've been to.  Granted it has been over a year since I've been to any Red Lobster so maybe there were changes across all Red Lobsters.  But that's just me giving them the benefit of the doubt.  To start, we ordered a new menu item, Lobster Nachos, as an appetizer.  It was disappointing as it was mostly cheese and sour cream and hardly any lobster.  Thus it ended up coming off as just a heavy dish.  For dinner, I ordered the stuffed flounder (not sure the exact name).  It was pretty good.  The portion was about right for the price.  The only downside being that it was a bit too salty -- some lemon juice might've helped.  And the cheddar bay biscuits.  This was the main reason we made the drive from Pittsburgh city to Red Lobster.  The biscuits were disappointing.  Like the nachos, it was also heavy.  It was also flat as if not enough yeast (if any?) was added.  It was mushier than fluffy.  Utterly disappointing, but still ok.  Ok at best.  If you like the biscuits from fried chicken places, this is still lighter than those and a class above.  But yea.  The one redeeming quality was the service.  The food came out surprisingly quickly, except for the biscuits, which the waitress forgot to get for us.  However, she did bring the biscuits and gave us 4 biscuits to-go as an apology.    Excellent service, but food was not of the Red Lobster glory that I've come to know."}
{"text":"I don't know what Happened to Red Lobster, but it definitely is not the same as it was 20 years ago.   Nothing on the menu looked fresh.  I ordered a lobster soup, and it was way too salty.  Yes, it tasted like frozen salt water seafood.   Not sure why people like this place, I can only assume because it is a seafood restaurant that caters to low class people who do not know the quality seafood..  Will not return again."}
{"text":"I'm writing this review based primarily on what my mother said since I hate seafood haha. Anyways we came there on a Thursday night around 6pm expecting to wait a good 30 minutes or more and but we got seated in less than 10 minutes. The waitress was nice and attentive. Now to the food. I got a steak that was actually quite good for being a seafood restaurant and my mother got the rock lobster and steak dinner. She says it was really good and better than the lobster she had at outback a mile or so way maybe 3-4 weeks before. I most likely will be returning if the service and food are as good as it was this time."}

{"text":"Went to red lobster for their endless shrimp sale. Had some of every available option. Started with a ceased salad which was really good with fresh parmesan. My favorite to my surprise was the shrimp linguini. Creamy and delicious pasta and shrimp with fresh parmesan shredded on top. My least favorite was the garlic shrimp. Couldn't taste the garlic and it was (along with most of the shrimp) really salty. Don't know if its done on purpose so the consumer drinks more water and gets filled faster. The cheddar buns served at every red lobster meal were good but not as I remember from long ago. Really dry in the middle but delicious none the less. My girlfriend thinks I tipped a bit generously considering it was only a 45$ bill but the waiter was a pretty cool guy. The saltiness was probably my biggest turnoff but considering how cheap it was compared to the rest of the menu it was a win in my books. Will probably come back during their next endless shrimp sale."}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of corporate restaurants, but we know quite a few people that work at this location so we like to stop by and see them once in a while.  I don't know if all RL's are like this, but they seem to hire the best kids here!  All the staff is hard working and seem to work together to make sure your meal comes out in a timely manner, etc.  Love the grilled fish menu (trying to stay on the healthy side) and they will make modifications to your order without hesitation or grief.  I wish there were more of a selection of sides, (asparagus or something on the healthy side) but that also might just be my taste buds."}
{"text":"Our server Cassy went out of her way to accommodate my kids and family.  She was very helpful and friendly.  I had a 3 year old and a 10 month old and she was very patient with both of them. She made us feel comfortable and brought out crackers and oranges for my kids. Food was tasty and bread was delicious as usual. A favorite place for my kids and my grandmother to come and enjoy a yummy lunch. When we were leaving the kids were looking at the lobsters and the host, Robert was very nice and friendly with my grandma (who is 82) and my kiddos also. He even took a lobster out of the water for my 3 year old to see it up closer. It was a very great experience and I love this red lobster location best of all!"}
{"text":"Went out for a nice dinner, salad dressing had a fly in it, then my wife's skewed shrimp had a hair wrapped around it. Totally gross! Go some where else! Cooks must not ware hair nets"}
{"text":"Ordered King Crab. The first two legs weren't split. I asked the waitress why. Those babies are sharp! I asked for something to open them. Got a tiny fork. Was bleeding after those two. She said they don't split them anymore because people complained they dried out. Guess what? All the rest were split. Never lie to a customer."}
{"text":"I should of know better then to stop here .  Shrimp not cooked and my steak is raw . Waiting for them to bring it back while everything else get cold . Horrible isn't even enough to discrible how bad this place is . YUK!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Steak is back ,now well done , fuck off Service matches the food"}
{"text":"Horrible! We waited in the lobby full of people for over 20 mins for a table. Normally I don't mind waiting but when I look and see servers shooting the breeze and half the restaurant empty well then it becomes an issue. Finally got a table, the food was horrible and then the bill came. What a rip-off!!! Stay clear of this place!"}
{"text":"Absolutely awful. Dirty. Stinky. Overpriced low quality crap. You can have a quality meal elsewhere for the price."}
{"text":"For years we had avoided Red Lobster like the plague. Things change however, and when we noted the addition of their Wood Grilled menu items 1-1/2 years ago we decided to give this chain another try. We were delightfully surprised with the tasty and healthier option over deep fried everything else. In fact, we have gone back several times. No more. The dream has died.  The Ray Road and I-10 location had been our favorite because it had seemed cleaner, newer and less run down and seedy than other locations nearer to our home. In just a couple months however this location has sunk into the abyss, transformed and burned out like a post-riot Ferguson store front.....figuratively.  When we arrived, we were informed of a 25 minute wait, even though most of the restaurant was darkened, empty and abandoned. We went to sit outside but all the seating was filthy and crusted over from neglect after a season of haboobs. It seemed as if there were more customers waiting than there were actually seated. We noted that any sort of decency as far as dress code is not enforced, as we watched in horror as a large hairy man wearing only a wife-beater shirt, flip-flops and cargo shorts was seated with his embarrassed partner.  When our pager finally went off, our hostess said \"Wow, that's the first one that has actually worked tonight\"  We were seated in a booth across from the bar that had been unoccupied the whole time we were waiting.  The hostess did not bring water or take a drink order. The table was dirty but had fresh silverware. The too-dim overhead light fixture was splattered with an unknown substance and wore stalactites of the same effused goo. After another 10 minutes, our waiter appeared. Though he had a speech impediment we were able to communicate enough to place our complete order, though he had to look over my shoulder and read the menu himself as he seemed quite unfamiliar with the items. Our soup arrived 55 minutes after we had actually stepped foot in the restaurant. On a Thursday night. Really.  The entrees arrived without any garnish or presentation on the plate, something that we have never seen at Red Lobster. The shrimp were tiny, far smaller than anything we have received in the past, even the lobster itself was sub-scale. The taste and quality did seem to be up to standard, though literally everything else was wanting. The manager passed by our table a couple of times but we were unable to catch his attention as it seemed as if he was engrossed in his bluetooth earbud and could not hear us or even see us waving him down.  For $75.00 spent on a dinner for two, this was a terrible value. Service, atmosphere, cleanliness, portion size have all been compromised from what we had experienced just a few months ago. Obviously the management cannot attract and hire a sufficient quantity or quality of staff. Extremely short handed and very dirty, declining quality of food.  Though we were fooled for awhile,You Are Who We Thought You Were, Red Lobster!!"}
{"text":"Standing in the lobby. Told by the servers it would be a 15-20 min wait by the hostess.  Walked around the restaurant.  5 two tops,5 four tops, and two 8 tops open but they are making about 6 parties of people not including us wait.  ARE YOU KiDDING ME!!!"}
{"text":"Worst red lobster I have ever been to.  Dirty inside. The staff were cleaning the tables off by scraping all table \"stuff\" on to the floor.  I watched in horror as two different staff members did this.   Salad was not washed I took a bite and got a mouth full of sand or dirt, at least I hope to god it was sand or dirt.  Screwed up my dinner order.   When they finally corrected it it was awful tasted terrible.   I have never had an experience at any red lobster this bad.  Ever !!  Just avoid this location !!"}
{"text":"Terrible ceasar  salad dressing. Fish of day overcooked. Baked potato was fine. Broccoli just broccoli.  Malt was very good. Lobster bisque good but over salted.  Food was just ploppped on plate. Definitely wont be back. The coconut shrimp was very good."}
{"text":"Standard  Red Lobster.  Went for a late lunch at 2:30 and received some of the worst service I have had in years.  The food was good (well, for Red Lobster - this is not a stellar place for seafood), but the non alcoholic margarita was tasteless.  20+ minutes to get the drink service. Jin seemed somewhat distracted and overloaded."}
{"text":"I understand it's lobsterfest however there was no one in lobby and many tables available and we still had to wait.  The hostess was very unfriendly.  After being seated our waitress was really slow and kept forgetting to bring us items.  Then my main entree finally came out and there was hair in it.  The manager didnt even come out to apologize or rectify it.  A new dish was finally brought out.  They wouldn't remove it from our bill nor offer any discounts.  Extremely disappointed."}
{"text":"We use to love Red Lobster, but our last visit was disappointing.   The service was very good and the staff attempted to make us happy, but the food was sub-par and overpriced.  Things were cold and not the quality we use to get there.  We had a large group and spent over $200 for a family birthday and were told they do not give birthday treats anymore.  Gees, a cup of ice cream with a candle would break you?  After many years, won't be back."}
{"text":"i'll be honest: I really never thought i'd love a Red Lobster joint as much as I love this location. I have been to other Red Lobster restaurants in Calgary but the McLeod location stands as the clear exception in service, taste, and overall awesomeness.   I've been to this location about 5 times and every time it has been a real delight. The first time me and my wonderful counterpart decided to eat here (it was the first time at any red lobster for both of us), we were surprised on a number of levels:   1) the excellent customer service - our waiter was one of the kindest yet professional servers i've ever dealt with; prompt, considerate, full of interesting and sound recommendations based on our preferences, i did not expect this level of exceptional service (this has been the case on all of our visits)   2) the sumptuous food! - ok, i will be the first to admit that i am no seafood expert but wow, the lobster and shrimp are consistently fantastic. the hearty, delicious goodness is a welcome change from what you get when you try and eat out at most restaurants these days. We make it a point to try something new each time we visit and each dish is always surprisingly good. Often times when we find something unsavoury it just comes from personal preference but because the meals often offer a variety of components, the meal as a whole ends up being a great dish.   3) the amazing price - the prices here are really a great value. Coupled with the fact that the portion sizes are very generous (we often split meals between the two of us us and we share the portions with 1 appetizer and 1 main being more than enough for us) you can easily expect your meal to end with a pleasant surprise upon receiving your bill.  There is something about these chains that really have some charm, maybe it's the dated decor but there's something about the consistency and antiquity that make you feel like you're some place else. Sometimes when i'm in here I forget which part of the city i'm in and that's nice feeling; across the street from the most contemporary mall in the city, Red Lobster can remind you of how staying true to form and principle can make you a distinguished classic. 5 stars.  *on a final note about Service, i would just like to point out that the Management here is just as excellent, the manager for the evening for our first visit made it extra special: upon finishing our meal, we were offered some high-value coupons just for visiting. I'm not sure what we did but maybe our polite table manners really won them over. call this act what you will but i've never had that sort of treatment anywhere (ever) so it was such a nice surprise. This event pretty much shaped our perception of this Red Lobster location and the bar was set; every time we have returned, we always expect to have a great evening and we haven't been disappointed since."}
{"text":"WORST EXPERIENCE! my family took my mom and sister out for their birthdays when we arrived at 7:00pm everything was good up until tthe drinks. Once we ordered our meals the waitress returns 5 minutes later stating that they do not have lobster tail so me and my brother chose something else. We waited for 40 minutes until the manager came to say that there is no more salmon and two plates we ordered had to be changed. She brought a menu first we noticed it was one plate so my husband chose a different meal. Then the waitress come along confused saying that there was no more salmon I had told her yes we were told she then mentioned well did the manager told you that you can change the salmon to tilapia. We were shocked because we were not mentioned that. Then we continued to wait until the manager comes out again saying no there is a second plate that has salmon you can change it to tilapia. We continued to wait at this time most of the table were empty on drinks so the waitress comes along and took 20 minutes to come back with drinks Finally after waiting for so long our food is ready. Everyone received their plates except my dad. I told the waitress the plate you are holding is my dad she looked at me confused and called the manager I then mentioned the same thing and the manager was trying to solve who plate it was until they realized that my dad was the only one left with no plate (REALLY). During the time we were eating the drinks did not get refilled once we were done that's when the waitress comes over asking if we wanted more drinks. (At this moment I was upset of the poor customer service) the staff was not coordinated at all! We were discounted $7 dollars but that seemed like a big joke. Would not recommend this place at all. All I was looking for my sister and mom to have a good birthday but it ended as a disaster with bad experience."}
{"text":"Monday is maybe not the night to dine out. Service is bad. Had to get the hostess to find the waitress. Got to give it to them, the hostess was wonderful."}
{"text":"Unfortunately selected this location for my wife's birthday. I called ahead a few hours prior and spoke to the staff and notified them off a party of 9. Unfortunately they are not equipped for family dinners. After arriving promptly when I told them I would arrive. I didn't expect immediate service being they only offer \"call ahead\", but over an hour waiting watching families come and go reinforces that they really didn't want large party business. The manager also didn't care to be present at all."}
{"text":"Red lobster restaurant has many reasons to attract customers. First reason, the service is cool and fast. For example, when you come in, you can always have table and you wait far it. customers like that kind of service a lot. Second, catering the food is interesting. For example, when you want to order, they say  would you like your order roast, fried or poached. Third, the style restaurant inside and outside. For example, view the restaurant outside is nice. Also inside of the restaurant has many beautiful picture and see many fish and lobster in big aquarium. Next, they have the best seafood in town. For example, they have  the best kind lobster in America. Finally, these reasons made it. The best restaurant in The United States."}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to try Red Lobster again after the horrible service we had about two months ago.  It was a Tuesday night so no one was waiting to be seated but there was no hostess when we walked in.  After five minutes, she walked out of the bathroom with another person (waitress) and then we were seated.  In being seated in a direct line of sight to the hostess, she had to be in the bathroom at least six or seven more times and anyone coming in to eat had the same issue we did.  We finally received our water after 10 minutes of waiting and then another 10 before our order was taken.  If it was busy, sure but it was not at all.   Biscuits - undercooked. Breaded shrimp - undercooked. Waited 10 minutes after my meal finally arrived to get a baked potato. Chicken - no flavor and tasted like it just came out of the microwave.  Two times in a row.  We will never eat there again.  The manager was too busy watching baseball to even notice what was going on, or just did not care.  One star for a nice waitress."}
{"text":"Seafood was ok. Not fantastic though. 1 entree is super filling, esp with a salad and side. The lobster mash isn't worth the extra 5$ it was alright. Didn't even finish it because there was so much food.  Ice cream was kind of good, really liked the giant cookie it. The clam chowder was bland. Aim for the free dessert or soup coupon!   Got the strawberry dakery and it was pretty good."}
{"text":"Great service and very clean. My mom & I stopped in for lunch last week. The entire staff were so professional and kind. We were seated by a window & didn't even have to ask!"}
{"text":"My lady & baby daughter had an awesome feast at this location. The food was good, but our server Scott made it awesome! He was appropriately attentive & accommodating. His friendly approach will have us returning soon."}
{"text":"Wow this location looks good inside and out since the renovations. It was looking bad. Had a early dinner with family and everything was really good.  Our waiter was excellent, drinks were refilled, the bread basket was kept full and the food came out hot.  The stuff mushrooms and shrimp cocktail was really good and our main entrees was also great..  We had the Rock Lobster / Sampler plate / Crab legs /  Broiled Trout / and the new Shrimp Sampler and a kids shrimp on the skewers.  Come check it out... The renovations made a BIG impact."}
{"text":"Everything was good, the food, service gets to you quick. But the people at the desk, are slow. There were so many seats, and she had to go to the back, find a table and then walk completely to the front to give us a 6 seated table.(which we only had 5)Last time we came here, we got seated at a booth and we all fit. So I don't understand why she had to go. I know its not the menus, they are at the front. We had two people come and ask \"is anyone taking care of you?\" It was embarrassing. Overall, food was delicious and good."}
{"text":"I saw a lot of negative reviews prior to eating here but decided to make my own decision. Well, my boyfriend and I were glad we went. Arriving at noon this past Saturday, we were greeted and seated immediately. Cozy seating. The food and service was great! All the waiters that passed our table said hello and our waiter was friendly and attentive. The Fish and chips was delicious. Five Stars to Red Lobster in Matthews, NC!!!"}
{"text":"Food is just okay. The biscuits and alfredo pasta were way too salty. I found the grilled shrimp too salty, too. The sirancha grilled shrimp was just shrimp with srirancha sauce on top lol. Clam chowder, salad, and brownie dessert were all average.  Not sure if we'll be coming back here."}
{"text":"I went in to red Lobster with thoughts and aspirations of enjoying plump juicy shrimp. And to enjoy said shrimp in quantities that would baffle modern science. Fortunately for I it was endless shrimp time at Red Lobster. How fortunate was I. Or so I thought. The lunch time experience began when we were waiting outside to be seated and witnessed our soon be be server bringing in a Taco bell fiesta ten pack through the front door. That's odd I thought. If I only knew..... Soon after being seated we meet our server, but with out her tacos. She begins to to take our order which is fairly simple since we are here with one things on our minds. Unfortunately she is interrupted by another hostess which tells her about some more tables she must attend to. This is the beginning of the end. She brings back our Cesar salads which are bland and tasteless at best. But no worries I am here for the shrimp. The shrimp arrives some 20 minutes later and is what one would expect from red lobster. Probably pre-frozen but tasty and numerous none the less. The shrimp was fine and the promise was \"all you could eat.\" which should be \"all you can tolerate.\" As I continue to enjoy the plates of shrimp in front of me the following plates seem to be taking longer and longer to arrive at our table. Our servers hospitality seemed to become more and more forced and in its place an uncomfortable air of \"are you full yet?\" A quick trip into the bathroom reviled a nightmare one would expect from a shady wrong side of town gas station. Never have I experienced a floor so sticky, it might well be confused for a massive piece of fly paper strewn with remnants of discarded toilet paper. And soon orders were becoming \"forgotten in the kitchen.\" I tried to be patient but after the second time of this and spending 3 hours inside of red lobster my patience reached its end. I did not eat all I could, but I have tolerated all I was able to. Next time shrimp is on the menu, it will not be at Red Lobster."}
{"text":"Passing by Ohio decided to try red lobster...let me start by saying Salad was frozen the $20 steak was dry and tasted like a It was microwave and the service is bad.. Next time we are in Ohio will try Olive garden.."}
{"text":"I bring my family here all the time and we love the food and the service. If anything is not quite right, they fix it and make sure we are happy. Not all chain locations are equal and this one deserves a visit."}
{"text":"crappy service. did not get acknowledged until 5-7 minutes after arriving. had to wait extra 15 minutes for our ready order to be given to us. missing side orders also. really frustrating when you get home after bad service and you are missing items.   usually good service here but tonight was horrible."}
{"text":"Ultimate Feast and Salmon Oscar w/crab cakes  Complaint Rating:   Contact information: San Tan Valley, United States  Red Lobster has been a special occasion restaurant for my Wife and me since 1992. The crab in the feast had a pungent fishy smell. The additional Chesapeake corn served with the Salmon Oscar was inedible. (Not seasoned as advertised and dry) We got the corn replaced. We reported the crab to the server and a manager who said she plated the meals visited us. She explained that she smelled the crab piece that I left and agreed with the same. She asked if we wanted a replacement, or is there any thing she could give us. We replied no. The check came with no adjustment and was over $60. This will be our last visit to Red Lobster."}
{"text":"I'm a maritimer so I'm always up for a good lobster feed. I decided to hit up Red Lobster for their annual Lobsterfest and check out the goods.   Calamari and clam strips appetizer: The calamari was ok.  The clam strips were crap but I expected that. I just wanted to eat all of the sea creatures available on the menu.   Lobster Lover's Dream I had never tried rock lobster before so I had to include this in the order. To tell the truth, I don't need to order it again. It's rather tough when compared to maritime lobster. The linguine, while stuffed with shrimp and lobster meat, lost its creaminess very quickly. The maritime lobster tail was tasty, if salty.  Ultimate Feast The garlic shrimp are tasty, the breaded shrimp are fine, The crab was succulent and the lobster tail was satisfactory. I would use less salt overall.  Service was  pretty good. No complaints except that our server removed two of the uneaten biscuits somehow, mid-feast, without us noticing. I would have objected. I thought the price was good for the enormous amount that we consumed.  Was it a superior seafood experience? No  Did I eat all of the sea creatures? Yes  Did that make me a happy boy? Yes  Win!  P.S. A word on tartar sauce: I don't know where anyone got the notion that tartar sauce made with sweet pickles and/or anything resembling miracle whip is any way to enhance a fish eating experience. If you are going to serve something like this please make it a savoury mayonnaise and if it must have pickle, use proper, dill pickle for Pete's sake!"}
{"text":"We only go there one or two times a year. Each time is the same. The food is slapped on the plate, vegetables are bland and limp, the servers are generally friendly. I see articles about Red Lobsters (US) changing its menu to try to save the company.  If the food is anything like the food here, maybe they should try to improve to food to save their business.  I would be embarrassed to say I am a \"Chef\" for this company based on the food they are serving.  The only redeeming quality are the biscuits."}
{"text":"i dont often go to restaurants for dinner, but i was home visiting my parents and they wanted to go out. I have to say, this was one of the better experiences i have had and i attribute that largely to the staff. Red Lobster as far as food is concerned is always going to be the same, and i wont complain on that. The food was tasty enough. But the service was outstanding. The greeters did a great job of directing traffic and addressing new comers, and the waitress was also right on. We were never left wanting or needing anything, and the timeliness of the delivery in courses was also spot on. Great location and well managed."}
{"text":"Don't mean to be snobby, but soaked in grease shrimp-all preparations,are not my idea of healthy eating choices.   cheddar biscuits are a round heart attack to come. how about fewer greasy items, perhaps simply grilled, with a salad of fresh not stale green leaf lettuce.  Lots of overweight diners who obviously like the fare."}
{"text":"This was VERY VERY DISAPPOINTING!!!!   This was my first visit to Red Lobster. I had two visitors from Europe staying at my house, and they wanted sea food. I called ahead for a 6:30PM table; we showed up at 6:29PM only to be seated at 6:39PM...   Our waiter never introduced himself; he didn't ask \"is this your first visit to Red Lobster?\" nor did he welcome us to Red Lobster. He never told us the daily specials..   We got our drink orders in, got our beers - and then we were left waiting for 20 minutes before our waiter came back to take our order. My guests both ordered the full \"New Orleans Salmon\". One plate came out with only a 5oz piece of fish.... I ordered a sirloin and a lobster tail.    The sirloin was OK, but why not offer tenderloin..?! Also: what seafood restaurant doesn't offer Béarnaise sauce..?!! The lobster tail was a SAD SAD story! It was a total of 4 bites of lobster. I also ordered a side Lobster Mashed Potatoes which was TERRIBLE!   Compared to Maestro's City Hall or Steak 44 which are great restaurants in Phoenix, this was like bad cafeteria food! The Lobster Mash was drenched in butter, and I could only eat one bite.   At no point during our visit did our waiter come and ask how our food was. 2 of us ran out of beer, and it took our waiter 25 minutes(!) to return to our table to ask if we needed \"anything else\" - at which point we ordered 2 more beers, which took 5 minutes to arrive.   When cleaning off the table our waiter noticed my untouched serving of \"Lobster Mashed Potatoes\" aka melted butter with mashed-up potatoes and some lobster pieces, and asked if I wanted something else ... to go with my empty plate...?!?!?!   At no point during our visit did a restaurant manager stop by to check on us to see how we were doing, to welcome us, not to thank us... I am sad that I took my European visitors to Red Lobster; I'm embarrassed!!!   For me dining is not about price but about quality,and this was the WORST value-for-money I have ever experienced"}
{"text":"We were party of 8 with 2 little one our waitress was the friendliest we came across in a while so sweet and quick. Food was amazing. It was really one the best services from the staff. Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"I have always been a fan of red lobster! However unfortunately last night was pretty sad. The food itself was normal nothing fantastic but better than not having to cook.   We got right in which was a nice surprise, however our service was horrible. It was hard to hear our server he was so quiet. Not once did he check in to see how our food was. And our drinks continued to sit empty before we got a refill, and i made sure to ask for no lemon as i hate it in my tea but yet received it. Our biscuits were super salty (which normally is ok... but this was extreme) but they took forever to get when others seemed to be receiving them around us.   I dont know if the server was just having on off night but he sure seemed to be fine standing and talking with the other servers. Its pretty bad if you write down to add shrimp to the salad and tell the table if i forget just remind me i tend to do that... READ YOUR ORDER THEN YOU WONT HAVE TO WORRY!"}
{"text":"We have eaten a few times over the years. Good food awesome choices. Great service. Tonight was no exception, however my Long Island ice tea was very sour. I sent it back and it was slightly better but not by much. I ended up putting water in it so that I could drink it. I would have returned it a second time, but the bartender looked over whelmed, and I over heard the manger refer to me as the complainer!?"}
{"text":"Although the food can be expensive the service was awesome! We had a great waitress who went above and beyond what she needed to do. Not to mention the food was great as well. If you're looking for a good date night spot and love seafood, this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"When I recently visited Red Lobster, with my family, we experienced THE WORST service ever. Our orders were incomplete, when they were bought out to the table. The Servers were unsure, and mixed up, as to who was suppose to actually wait on our table, when we were first seated.   We asked for drink refills, several times and never received them. Also, I asked our server to bring me a Crab Cracker--several times-- so I could open my Crab Legs, but he NEVER did!!!  I ended up taking the Crab Legs home, because I could not crack them open due to NOT HAVING the proper utensil!!!  Additionally, they had a lot of MAJOR renovations going on at that property--so it should not have even been open for business, until the renovations were completed.   Furthermore, the lighting above the tables was dark and dreary. And the TVs that were above the Bar area were not working."}
{"text":"Let me tell you about the 5 star treatment my husband I received yesterday at this Red Lobster location. Lobster fest is a tradition with us. We go every year. Last month we went to our usual location on Stephanie and Marks and the food and the service was the worst (but I'll do that review after this one). We decided to give another try and went to the one on Flamingo & Eastern. First let me tell you about our waitress Dana. She is without a doubt one of the best waitresses I've ever encountered in Any restaurant including 5 star. We told her about our experience at the other location. She apologized for the experience and said our experience there would be nothing like that AND IT WASN'T! She took our orders and then Jessica the manager came over. She said Dana had told her about the horrible treatment and service wed received at the other location and wanted to personally apologize for that experience and wanted to be sure their service so far was up to par. I assured her it was and thank you. Let me tell you that Dana made sure that EVERYTHING was absolutely delectable from the cocktails to the hors d'oeuvres to our main courses where absolutely top notch. We even took photos of how beautifully it was plated as well as the proportions. We also took photos of Dana and Jessica. We live in Henderson and will Never go back to that location again. Because of those 2 lobster fest will remain a tradition for years to come. You need to experience those two for yourselves. Trust me it's worth the drive."}
{"text":"WILL NEVER, EVER, EVER, EVER GO THERE AGAIN!!!! Let me tell you about our lobster fest from hell . Maybe about a month or a little more ago we went to our regular Red Lobster on Stephanie & Marks for our traditional lobster fest meal. We've been going for at least 5 yrs and always at that location.  When we arrived around 3 we were happy to see the restaurant was maybe about half full which meant we wouldn't have to wait for a table and the food would be out quickly and would be great. We were immediately seated and our waiter who's name I wish I had along with his mgr promptly took our drink, appetizer and main course orders. He promptly came back with our drinks but the appetizers took so long we thought he was going to bring them with dinner. When they finally came we were so hungry those were eaten in a couple of minutes. After about 30 mins later the waiter apologized and said for some reason they're backed up in the kitchen and it wasn't just our food. Several other customers were having the same issue. We kept our composure and waited. Almost another 25 minutes went by before we finally got our food. We dig in knowing it'll be worth the wait. It wasn't. My stuffed lobster tail had what looked like a tablespoon of stuffing glopped on top like an afterthought. I looked at the picture and then mine and was outdone. I tried to keep my composure because I knew my husband was already about to blow when he cut into his med rare steak and it was brown. Even in the middle! It was so dry it tasted like sawdust. I took a bite of my green beans and they were cold. Now my husband is about to blow so he told the waiter how nasty our food was and we wanted to talk to a mgr. Over 10 minutes go by and no mgr. We just got up and left. We almost got to the car and my husband said he couldn't let it go and went back inside. NOW that he's making a big stink at the front desk, who rushes out, the mgr. My husband told him how long we'd been coming there for Lobster fest.  I won't even get into what he told  the mgr and the waiter about their crappy service and inedible food but you can be sure they know we'll NEVER go back there again! Don't let the Henderson location fool you. You'll get better at a soup kitchen"}
{"text":"When I was seated, I had to wait 11 minutes for a server and they weren't all that busy on a Monday night.  The manager came by 3 times so see if my waitress came by yet.  All I can say is this is \"slop\" on a plate.  I ordered the Admirals platter.  Flounder came out so over cooked and the other seafood on the plate was greasy and very tastless.  Not  much value for the money and very poorly cooked seafood that doesn't even taste like seafood.  The scallops were the size of a dime.  I will never, ever step foot in a Red Lobster again."}
{"text":"Went here on Tuesday 7/15/14 with a party of 6.  We were seated promptly.  It went downhill from there.  Was 10 min before someone came to take our drink order.  Then the biscuits were kinda burnt on the outside and very doughy in the middle.  Did not taste like the their usual biscuits.  Then we waited another 15 min. for someone to take our order.  Waitress didn't come back after we were served to see how things were.   She returned as we were finishing our meal.  We all requested to go boxes.  She came back in about 10 min. with a few boxes but not enough for all of us.  So, another delay.  Finally the check came and there were things charged on it we did not get.  Never came back to refresh our drinks. Total time spent:  2 hrs!!!!!   Server was not a people person.  No apologies for our waiting.   Won't be going back there again.   The restaurant was less than half full."}
{"text":"Wanted to treat me and wife to a good lunch.  We were seated Immediately because it was a slow day.  Our waitress was nice and my wife ordered, lobster scampi linguine with a side of scallops.  I had new york strip and lobster tail with a side of shrimp.  My wife's scallops were good and my shrimp was just okay.  The salads came and looked like the butt end of the lettuce, all whit pieces.  We stopped a server who was walking by to tell him to get our server because of a problem with our salads.  He looked like he had an attitude and walked to the kitchen and yelled \"they are complaining that their salads look and taste funny! \" \"but there is nothing wrong with them!\".....this could be heard by the entire dining room.  We got the manager Chris who said he would take care of it.      Our waitress came by several times to say that it would be just a few more minutes for our food which took about an hour and a half to come.  My steak was tough and hard to cut and chew, my lobster tail was like rubber which could be used to patch a flat tire.  My wife's lobster in her linguine was chewy like leather and was swimming in a pool of garlic.  I told the manager and he was apologetic and offered me a desert which I did want to risk my life with.  The waitress said she was embarrassed but said we could still leave a tip.  We looked at her like she was crazy and left.     We made it home and promptly took Alka Seltzer and my wife has been in and out of the bathroom for awhile so far.  WE WILL NEVER EAT AT THIS LOCATION EVER AGAIN!!!!   I would give 0 stars but 1 star is the lowest!"}
{"text":"There was plasting wrap in the dessert. I had a coupon dor a free desert and they gave me a hard time honoring it."}
{"text":"I'd rather eat from the lobster tank because that was the cleanest place in the joint. For the price of these \"seafood\" dishes, one could be eating cuisine from a real chef at Vogue instead of the microwave meisters, Julio and Juan."}
{"text":"I went there today and had really great service!!!! They are awesome my waiter came around a few times to ask how we were doing. The food came quick and was really good. I have nothing to complain about. I love going to places where the service is great!!!"}
{"text":"the lady who helped us was so so kind! went there for a friend's birthday dinner and thoroughly enjoyed the food and the service! We had to wait for 10 mins to get seated as we hadn't made a reservation which isn't bad at all. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I went there for a lunch with my boyfriend and it was ok for someone who isn't a seafood fanatic. The food was freshly made and quite tasty. I also enjoyed the drinks there too.   Customer service was not the best but the waitress tried her best.   Overall I'd give it a 4/5."}
{"text":"ate there 11/21/15 after a day at the Musical instrument museum. Great service. i wish i could remember the guy who waited on me and my wife.  He was great.  He was a long time server and was ontop of everything.  Food was good.  I had the lobster scampi linguine. great.  large amounts of lobster way more than i expected.  My wife had a lobster  and shrimp was perfect.  We usually dont eat at redlobster but this one when we are in N Phx is def worth the stop."}
{"text":"Amazing! I'm new to yelp. Just got the app so this experience has been a few months back but it was so incredible that I felt the need to write it now. My husband and I went for our anniversary back in October and everything from the staff to the food was impeccable! We've been to different ones throughout the U.S. over the years and this one by far was the best one! The food was so fresh, hot, and delicious!  Our waiter did an awesome job of making sure all our needs were met and our drinks were full. I wish I could remember his name to mention him on here. The manager that night also made his way to our table to make sure our experience was a good one. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND GOING HERE! DEFINITELY WILL GO BACK!!"}
{"text":"My developmentally disabled daughter and I went there for lunch and had the best service , the waiter named Jim took excellent care of us and the food was awesome!  Jim recommended dishes after we asked questions and was very accommodating and smiled every time he looked at us and was sincere.  The restaurant was very clean and inviting and we will definitely go there again."}
{"text":"Quiet place, nice location and deco. Arrived around 8.30, there's not many people left, 3-4 tables. Half dozen fresh oysters for appetizer. I ordered stuff whole lobster with baked potato and grilled asperagus. Lobster was fresh and cooked well but the asperagus were overcooked. Hubby had fish and crab cake with mash potato, they were alright. Both came with sad looking ceasar salad. The service was not good, had to ask for utensils and didn't offer the desserts."}
{"text":"My family took my grandma out to dinner so we could celebrate my brother's birthday. Food was good. Customer service was fantastic. We got served by Theresa and she was very kind and informative. Best service we've ever had at Red Lobster."}
{"text":"We will NEVER be going to any Red Lobster again. I get to go to Red Lobster once a year for my birthday. Last year we had a problem at the same location. I thought we could try them one more time. That was a big mistake. The service totally sucked. We asked for a few extra items such as sauce lemon and melted butter when we put our order in. None of the extra items came with our order. We asked 3 times for melted butter and when she finally brought it out it was hard butter not melted. There was nothing in my order that I can use the hard butter for. We did give this restaurant another try but it didn't work out. Not impressed whatsoever even the prices were high. I was very disappointed as a birthday meal."}
{"text":"I went to red lobster yesterday for my birthday dinner.  I was eating my meal and looked over to my shrimp and noticed a hair in it. The waitress gave me a new plate to go and i get home and open my new food later only to discover a hair on the new food. Im completely disgusted with this place and wont ever be going back."}
{"text":"My hubby ordered a steak & a lobster stuffed potato. He was very happy with both. I got the Seafood Trio and chose the almond-crusted salmon, lobster Mac and cheese, & shrimp scampi.  The salmon was dry and over-cooked. Instead of being crusted with almonds, a few slivers of toasted almonds and a handful of panko crumbs were scattered over top of the fish. Not sure what purpose the breadcrumbs were supposed to serve. The salmon came on a bed of tasteless pilaf. Yuck.  The lobster mac was... weird. Not bad, exactly, but I doubt I'll ever order it again. The cheese sauce was runny and lacked flavor, though the lobster pieces were yummy and cooked properly.   The scampi is one of my favorite items on Red Lobster's menu and it was predictably good tonight. Yummy!  For dessert we ordered a chocolate chip lava cookie/cake combo. There was a lot less chocolate in the middle than the picture on the menu led us to believe, but wow was that thing good! I'll go back sometime just for that dessert!"}
{"text":"We ate there on Friday night and both my husband and I ended up with food poisoning from the scallops. Not sure I would ever eat there again!"}
{"text":"Still the best fish tacos in town. Also had the flounder that was cooked perfectly. Great chef and staff! Love this location when we want a reasonably priced lunch where the grilled fish is fresh and not fishy or dry. Service is awesome."}
{"text":"Wow, so i have never been to the red lobster and now, I wanted to finally go and try it for valentines day. I just called them to book a table, and the guy told me they don't accept reservation. And it's not because i asked for valentines day. Apparently, they never accept reservation :( it's 20 minute drive from my place, and there's no way I can drive that far to be told we have to wait one hour to have a seat... It's a shame :( and on yelp, it was said they take reservation, this is wrong!"}
{"text":"Fabulous meal! Shared appetizer and meal.  Roasted Garlic Mussels - New Wood Grilled Lobster, Shrimp and Salmon over Green Beans and Baby Gold Potatoes. More than enough food for 2. (ate appetizer with meal) Service started out great but as it got busier server struggled a little, but was very friendly. Forgot our biscuits but the bread served with the mussels was very good. He was apologetic when realized he'd forgotten biscuits and small fork we had asked for. No conplaints on any of the food, was all very good!! Like the menu changes, look forward to trying more."}
{"text":"Wasn't happy with the food ...order the calamari and hardly add any in it ....it was mostly all fried vegetables which I thought for the price was a rip off ...the food was very salty!!! So for the price I paid for our dinner (which was my husband bday) and red lobster isn't even REAL SEAFOOD!!! I was better off going to Long Johns Silver !!!  Sorry I tried giving them another chance and it still SUCKED!"}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible dinner. Awful food for a high price! Bill was $75!! Never ever again! Waitress was nice...hence only star"}
{"text":"Ah, Red Blobster, one of the few food chains I can actually stand. First off, I never order any of the fried/breaded dishes, which eliminates 1/2 the menu. You're better off going to Long John Silvers and paying 1/3 of the price. Now, on to the positives:  1. All you can eat shrimp (when available). This is the main reason I come here! If I ever choose to overdose on salt and butter, this is the place I'm headed. My record is 90 shrimps, mostly Cajun grilled and scampi. Don't bother filling yourself up with biscuits and rice/Alfredo sides that come with some of the shrimp orders. I would also recommend not drinking Mountain Dew with it because it could result in a cataclysmic reaction in your stomach.     2. Specials. The last time I went, I got a seafood casserole that had shrimp, mussels, clams, lobster, and scallops. Even though every bite led me closer to heart failure, I couldn't help but keep eating it. No joke, if you ever see seafood casserole on the menu, order it. The only bad part was that it was around $25.  - 1 Stars for all of the fried/breaded food -0.5 Stars for overpricing -0.5 Stars for the long wait"}
{"text":"My wife and I have been here twice and while the service is great the food is just not what we expect from a chain that includes the word \"Lobster\" in its name.  Everything I've ordered from this location has been sub par.  The shrimp dishes are messy and swimming in unnecessary, unidentifiable liquid.  The pasta dishes made me feel like I was eating hay.  Aside from that the place is thoroughly clean and the staff is friendly and attentive.  Personally I wouldn't eat here for free."}
{"text":"Service is terrible, I don't know how Red Lobster can let this place slide. Others are good. Not this location. After waiting for 20 minutes at our table. I had to go to the front desk to ask for the bread. When my meal arrived, the mashed potatoes that I had ordered, were not with my order. The potatoes arrived when I was almost finished with my meal. I ask for the check because I didn't want to have to wait long periods of time for anything more. When the check arrived, I looked it over and realized that the check was for another table, not mine. Again I had to wait for my check. Don't go to this location unless you plan on spending the day there."}
{"text":"I wanted to go to Red Lobster for awhile, because I thought that, if nowhere else, I could get some quality seafood there. I was very disappointed with the food I ate. My wife and I ordered some of the more expensive dishes from the menu, and all seafood came either heavily breaded and deep-fried or drenched in cooking oil. Fish and shellfish have very delicate flavors, and they were totally destroyed by the cooks. I couldn't taste anything behind the oil; it all tasted like French fries. Given that this is one of the priciest restaurants in town in its class, it's definitely wasn't worth my money. I'm not going back."}
{"text":"I agree with some that the wait time for a table can be long on Friday or Saturday nights.  Other times I have gone I've been seated right away.  Never have gone with a large party though so I imagine that could be difficult getting seated too.  Parking can be tough on those weekend night too because The Olive Garden shares the lot.   The food is a little expensive but I have also always found it pretty good.  I mostly like the trout as I can never seem to do it as well at home.  The biscuits are just sooo good.  I've never had any problems with the wait staff.  They always seem really friendly and stop by at least twice to see if everything is okay.   The atmosphere is usually relaxing though the lighting can be a little too dark.  The noise level is better than most restaurants unless they are having a large party or a birthday party where the wait staff comes out to sing."}
{"text":"This is a beautiful restaurant! It has beautiful high ceilings and is very well kept. Went there for dinner with my boyfriend and the food was delicious! Our waiter was very polite and attentive. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Bullshit service. They got my cpmbo wrong and when we had to leave before they could.make it rigjt they still charged full price. As we had to leave right away because my elderly father was ill I did not argue... but really they need to serve their customers better."}
{"text":"My family and I love this restaurant in general, but we particularly love this central Scottsdale location. The new decor is really comfortable and gives a lot more ambience than the old model. We ate there this weekend for lobster fest, yay, but I was the only one who ordered something with lobster. My husband and son both ordered shrimp scampi (weirdos...it's Lobster Fest). Our waiter was friendly, got our drink orders and yummy hot biscuits out to us right away. It wasn't long that the piping hot shrimp scampi orders arrived at our table. I was promised mine would be out soon. I ordered the Bar Harbor Lobster Bake. A few minutes later the manager came by and apologized for my order not coming out when the guys meals came. She was a little horrified by it, I could tell. She mentioned that she never lets food to come out in stages like this! I could tell someone was going to get a \"what for\" any second. She was very, very sweet and as soon as my dinner was ready she brought it over herself and again apologized. She said she was so embarrassed it happened, and I really didn't even think anything of it until she mentioned it. She comp'ed my meal and it was the most expensive dish at our table! Of course we were super pleased by such service. Mistakes happen, and her acknowledging the mistake and apologizing is all I really needed, but it takes really great customer service to go that extra mile. Our waiter also apologized and overall, we were all very pleased with our meals...super yummy...and our service..overall, great!  We will be back again and again."}
{"text":"Been to this location a couple times & the service has been consistently great! Food well prepared & delicious. Recommend the coconut shrimp appetizer. Mixed drinks are a bit weak. If there's one thing that bugs us about Red Lobster it's their decor & atmosphere - very outdated."}
{"text":"In a word: inconsistent. Accepting that it is a chain, and not a local (sea)foodie hangout, it's usually ok. However, I have occasionally been served truly dreadful food here, from soggy fried shrimp to dried out salads. I don't send food back readily, but have had to do it several times at this location (and not at other Slobster's). Very crowded on weekends. Decor updated recently and is attractive. Servers are usually friendly and often knowledgable if not expert. Managers who will keep the kitchen on it's toes are sorely needed. For the quality I consider the chain overpriced, the seafood version of Olive Gardens--if you are going to pop for lobster or wish to impress someone who's over the age of 17, hunt down a better place and make the drive.  BTW: Do not let them seat you near the serving area by the bar--why they even consider that location fit for customers I cannot imagine, and they seat people there even when there is more desirable seating available (and any other seating is preferable)."}
{"text":"The endless shrimp is awesome. But I had it 2 times in the past few weeks, so I decided to try the fish and chips. The fish was chewy and the chips were a bit under cooked and mealy.   The hostesses and staff were very friendly. The service was excellent, as it has been the last couple of times we've eaten there."}
{"text":"Took my wife here today for her Birthday with our little girl. Our waitress Jazmen was awesome!! Great hospitality and service!!! Jazmen if you read this Thank you again!!!"}
{"text":"We were driving around looking for a new place to eat and passed Red Lobster. Could we stoop so low? I mean isn't that like a fast food restaurant? Gotta tell you we were pretty happy. My husband and son got the crab & roasted garlic bake and were very pleased. I got the crab linguini Alfredo and that was to kill for! We were served delicious little garlic flavored biscuits and an awesome Caeser salad. Lots of food! I had my leftovers the next day. Yummy!! The restaurant was clean and cute nautical theme. Felt a bit like I was in Maine. On the down side - very rich food high in calories and somewhat salty. I took a long bike ride after dinner. I do think they have a low Na & carb menu though. Will we go back? Heck yes!"}
{"text":"If you do takeaway, just add 10 minutes to whatever time they tell you you & then pick it up.   Other than that, good place."}
{"text":"We hadn't been there since it opened and should have known better then to come back.  The food was typical restaurant chain and average at best, the exception being the rolls.  The service was less than average with the wait for our entree's being way too long.  There are so many better options locally and I would suggest using them."}
{"text":"Really like the service. The food didnt take long and our server was excellent kuddos to him. Did push us was very good with the menue and gave is great suggestions when it was time to order. Definitely will be back soon."}
{"text":"Horrible service,  I told the hostess that I was ordering to go, and I had my grandaughter with me,(4 yrs) I was told that I had to order in the bar and that I had to leave my granddaughter on the side if the seat at the entrance of the restaurant, that was rude, and uncalled for because I had  look and the menu and at the same time I was constantly watching her from a distance, some customers that we walking out were even concern on why was she there alone, the waitress took a long time to take my order and she was not courteous at all. I will never go again."}
{"text":"Loved it!   I always come here very year for a traditional family dinner..  My personal fav is the popcorn shrimp!"}
{"text":"I've been to this location more than few times. The food is okay. I wish the service was faster.  The last time I was there it took a long time for the waiter to come around."}
{"text":"We came inside waited for ten minutes to be acknowledge then we had to wait another five to ten minutes  to be seated for a booth as. As we are waiting I seen a booth and the hostess  told me \"that the server was full, so I said okay then once the manager came up she told the hostess to sit us at the same exact booth..... So as we were seated a SPIDER!!!!! crawls across the table.....I'm so done with these MOFOS!!!!!"}
{"text":"First, I would have given this place zero (0) stars if possible. However, seeing as that is not the case, it gets one. The restaurant was remodeled and hardly recognizable once inside. The decor was great considering it is a Red Lobster. The compliments cease here.  When my family arrived, the greeter said nothing to us. She simply stood behind her station and looked at us. I took advantage of the delay so that my son could use the restroom. However, once we arrived out of the restroom, my fiance was still standing there waiting to be helped. I asked what was taking so long and the greeter said that she was waiting for someone to seat us. First impression was off to a great start, but I let it slide thinking that the restaurant was not prepared for the afternoon rush.  Once seated, the waitress took forever to get to us. Roughly fifteen (15) minutes passed before she returned to ask what we wanted to drink. By this time, we knew exactly what we wanted for the rest of our visit. About ten (10) minutes later, the waitress returned with our drinks, but somehow my fiance's drink was left at the bar. I am not even sure how this was the case considering it was a variety of iced tea. She said she would be right back with it...  My son, in the mean time, had to use the bathroom again. It took roughly ten (10) to fifteen (15) minutes for him to do his business. When we returned, the waitress was still M.I.A. About five (5) minutes later, she returned with our salads, but no drink for my fiance. To add insult to injury, the salad was warm. Furthermore, the waitress, upon being told that she left my fiance's drink at the bar, laughed and said, \"I'll get it in a minute.\"   Following this, and noting that the other waitresses/waiters were tending to their guests, we promptly got up and walked out. This was a complete waste of our time (nearly an hour of waiting for food and over an hour total). This is only the second time I have walked out on a restaurant having eaten nothing. Obviously, I will not return."}
{"text":"Very good size and service. Very tasty food. Some dish is a little bit salty to me, but I think eat very light as home.   Overall, very good experience. Will come back again!"}
{"text":"Not a fan.  The food was bland and the waiter took almost I think an hour 30 mins to get our food?  Not worth the wait.  I did like the biscuits though  (that's pretty much the only thing we had to eat while waiting)"}
{"text":"Had a terrible meal here from start to finish.  I took relatives out for a special occasion and they recommended it, probably because they felt it was reasonably priced. The meal started with the four of us being seated at a table large enough for six.  This was nice until the waiter came over.  He placed the plates and silverware at the two people nearest him and then literally tossed the plates and silverware to us rather than walking around the table. I ordered the oysters.  These must have been frozen at some point, they were watery and tasteless.  Even my brother didn't want to finish them. I ordered a salad with \"bleu cheese\" dressing.  The dressing was thin and tasteless, very little blue cheese flavor. For my entree I ordered the \"fresh catch\" which was a Pacific rockfish, blackened.  The fish was way overcooked and the blackening was really tasteless.  This came with sides of rice pilaf and broccoli.  Both were undercooked. I left over half of my food when we left and the waiter didn't ask anything about the food and why I had left it. My wife said her meal was \"ok\".   Was this just an unusually off night?  I don't know since I was visiting from out of town but I definitely won't go to this location again.  As a note, I've eaten in a few Red Lobsters and the food was always adequate so I would say it was this location that was the problem."}
{"text":"We have been here multiple times and always get the raw oysters. We usually always sit at the bar and always get great service. We will get drinks and other appetizers but our focus and reason for always coming that is the raw oysters. We enjoy this place and will continue to come back for the raw oysters."}
{"text":"first time in my life I ever got brown lettuce at a Red Lobster. YUCK! oh well the rest of the meal was great and my server was prompt and offered to get me another ready mde salad but I'm sure the rest will be eaten by some one else until the fresh greens come out for fri night. Very clean and well lit place just brown lettuce really throws me or should I say tosses me?"}
{"text":"Don't know what happen to Red Lobster. This food was barely edible. Im gonna have to give this place a break for a while. Both lobster and shrimp were dry.2 Biscuits were very very oily. 2 biscuits were over cooked. I never leave cheddar biscuits in the basket. Ever. I just wanted to get out that place. Will not return."}
{"text":"The service and the food is good. I've been here a lot. My friends and I love Red Lobster."}
{"text":"How do they make the food so tasteless?  And the tartar sauce, has no taste. Isn't the point of Tatar sauce to ADD flavor?  Meanwhile the wait staff must get bonus points for using the word \"awesome.\""}
{"text":"The waitress was a lady ooooh I forgot her name, but one of the oldest there.  We sat in the back (straight back when you walk in) if that helps??? She was very nice and courteous.  I had the shrimp scampi with a steak, the shrimp was good but steak had no flavor and was too tough. Raspberry lemonade was really good, try it. The popcorn shrimp, crab pasta and fries I pilfered from my friends plate they were average except for the pasta, that was pretty good.  It does taste like crab so if you don't like crab stay away. Just 3 stars because of the steak and even though I told her about it she still charged me for it. Not my first choice for seafood but I would go back."}
{"text":"Ordered the shrimp and they were grey and bitter tasting. They offered to recook the order but it came back still tasting bitter. Manager offered to switch for another dish but didn't comp or discount, and even charged us the extra dollar difference between the shrimp and fish and chips. The replacement dish was edible but not very good, the batter was soggy and the fish fell apart into slivers.  Server was very nice though."}
{"text":"We had the snow crab special and the 4 course meal with the new pork chops. Server was very helpful with descriptions and recommendations. Crab was as expected and the sauce for the pork was very good. Also, key lime pie! Not a bad night out at this location."}
{"text":"This place needs a thorough clean. My booth table had an unpleasant smell. No prices on their drinks in the menu. Garden salad and crabmeat linguine were horrible. I will not be going there again."}
{"text":"Went during Lobster Fest, food was great, seated quicker than stated and very attentive service.  Couldn't ask for a better experience at a chain restaurant, was pleasantly surprised"}
{"text":"Terrible experience. Went with my husband and 8 month old daughter, we were told 20 mins for a table with a highchair. 30 mins later I said I couldn't wait any longer and they started checking seating and I heard them say they didn't have anywhere for a highchair. I told them not to worry about it we had already waited long enough and we left."}
{"text":"My family placed a carry out on 08/12/17 @ the South Decatur.  It was late but I must admit how satisfied my family and I was so pleased with our food.  We ever did an errand before going back to my mother 's and the dinner was still warm enough to eat. Not only was the dinner delicious but the customer service was great.  I wish I could remember his name. Overall,  we love Red Lobster and we will continue to eat there; the very time we have a taste for seafood;  I'm quite sure it will be Red Lobster. Keep up the good work!!!!"}
{"text":"I have had too many disappointing dishes and experiences at this location.  I avoid going here unless forced.  Long waits for average food and service.  There are so many better seafood options around town.  I'm amazed people still visit this location."}
{"text":"I gave 4 stars for the food and the help of a waitress that wasn't ours. Our waitress Rene, we'll if you get her section. Go to another, I don't know of she's having a bad night or if she's always like this no smile rude and abrupt with my wife and short with me. Not sure we wanted to ask for anything cause felt like you were bothering her,  not the worst service I experienced but she's in the top 2."}
{"text":"I have always heard rumors of how amazing their biscuits were and so last night we decided to double date it out, to have a drink and indulge in biscuit madness. FACT: the biscuits were fantastic and so was the service. BUT as for my meal, I would have had a much better review if I weren't sick to my stomach right now with food poisoning. I am officially a zombie in this state. I ordered the tray of oysters as an appetizer and I regret that decision immensely at the moment. My cousin and her bf ordered the endless shrimp and crab and didn't seem to have any issues with their meals, but it must have been a bad day to pick oysters. On a positive note, the bartender was great at mixing drinks but I am now fighting to retain any bodily fluids possible so just BEWARE OF THE OYSTERS! I had to give them two measly stars for the service, biscuits and drinks but I don't think I will be going back to this location ever again. They obviously do not store and prepare their seafood properly, nor do they dispose of spoiled food as they should rather than serving it to customers. So keep that in mind before you order."}
{"text":"We came in on a whim at a peak time. We were seated in 10 minutes and followed by an excellent meal.   The staff is great,  quick and friendly.   I ordered the 4 course feast, And upgraded to the Lobster bisque.    My meal was the Cajun chicken linguini Alfredo.  Which was amazing and left me so full.    I finished off the meal with a caramel cheesecake.  Which was good because I didn't have room for any more.   Amazing meal and would recommend to anyone who is hungry at a peak time and looking for good food and service."}
{"text":"I came here last night for my birthday with my boyfriend. Hands down was the most disgusting meal I was ever served. We both ordered the crab lovers delight. What they brought out looked like someone's leftovers. I thought it was a joke. The crab legs were all different colors, they had been cut apart, and looked unsafe to eat. The plate was filthy too. We ended up asking for the manager who didn't handle it well at all. She said \"well your fine to leave then\" after we complained and said we were unhappy with our meal. Stay away from this place. Zero stars. Ruined my birthday dinner."}
{"text":"I am quite disappointed with this place as well as my family. Our waitress's name was Janice. She never spoke up and we were seated by the bar, so it was hard to hear her. I ordered raspberry lemonade and was offered refills but my grandma had ordered raspberry iced tea. She was not offered a refill. Janice's reply: \"The bartender has to make it.\" Never offered her another one. Came back and offered me another lemonade though. (We tipped 15% at the end of the meal--she didn't even deserve that!)  We were given 2 biscuit baskets at the start and went through them quickly. We weren't given any more until our main meal came--and we had salads and soup that came before that!  Our main meal came, I had ordered the snow crab legs. Overcooked. It was disgusting. Not to mention the way it was served wasn't handled with care--leg pieces were broken off from the clusters! I had a side of fries with that and they weren't even warm. My grandpa had ordered the rice pilaf. It was bland. He also got a side with that, and it never even came. He was charged for it anyway.  I am bitter about the way Janice and this restaurant was. We are not coming back. Go to a different one for good service AND food."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time last week. Had never been so thought let's give it a go. Went on a Tuesday night at around 6:30pm. Seated right away but was told on the weekend there is sometimes a small wait.  Was served lovely Cheddar bay biscuits. Try not to fill up on these too much. It is hard not to eat lots of them. The table shared the lobster and artichoke appetiser.  For main meal I had the chicken linguine. Both dishes were lovely and it comes with a caesar salad if your there for dinner,  not lunch. Couldn't eat all the pasta but it was so good.   The whole table enjoyed their meals and with deserts it was $115.   Looking round I didn't see many people eating lobster so even if you don't like lobster you will still find plenty to eat.   Overall it was a great meal, nice atmosphere and reasonably priced. My first experience left me wanting to come back."}
{"text":"Extremely rude waitress. Paid $10 for 4 scallops. Portions getting tinier and tinier. Huge bill to pay at the end. Very disappointed.  Also I had an insane seafood poisoning I have never gotten in my entire life. I lay down in bed with bloated discomfort for the rest of the night."}
{"text":"Great food all the way around.  Katrina was the most superb server providing excellent service, suggestions, and overall charming company and insight."}
{"text":"My family normally comes here for small celebrations. Most of our non immediate family and friends are not keen on seafood, this in combination with price is reason we come on certain occasions.  The place is dark and the decor is outdated, I am not sure if the other chains are the same.  The handful of times my family has come, the staff has been friendly greeting, seating us and waiting our table.  The food has always been good and we never had a problem getting our endless supply of biscuits. I am sucker for biscuits, the biscuits are light in the inside and crunchy on the outside. We have always gotten them hot.  The pastas are well cooked but like a lot of items on the menu, they can be very rich with the quantity of butter and salt.  The only time I was disappointed is when I ordered fresh lemonade I was not impressed."}
{"text":"This was my first time in red lobster in about 2 years. The venue was nice and clean. Most of the employees and/or servers were mature. Our server was excellent and informative considering I told her it was my first time in red lobster ever haha..... But it was not crowded and I would recommend this restaurant to someone having a casual or special night."}
{"text":"El was a little slow on the service side. Stood around awkwardly when taking order or checking on table  kinda freak scared me out. Asked if we wanted more biscuits and never brought them. Some of the worst service I've had from anywhere.  To make it even worse the restaurant wasn't bust at all."}
{"text":"Steak  was hard as rock chicken was gross the seafood was also not good I've been  here both times the first it was very average, second time was a for a second chance, food was not good I threw most of it out."}
{"text":"I'm typically a fan of this restaurant.  I'm glad they put free salad with lunch back on the menu; paying for a salad was nuts.  Food is always what I expect.  They remember me and several know me by name.  Lately, however, the hostess staff seem incapable of seating people.  The restaurant was virtually empty at 11:30 am on a Saturday, but the hostess had people lined up in the lobby.  (Apparently, not enough of their wait staff came to work on time and they were short on servers.)  It was chaos.  The place is always clean, even the restrooms, and I'll definitely go there again.  But they need a better hostess process."}
{"text":"I'm Asian-  so I'm pretty familiar with seafood and how fresh it should taste.    There were good and bad things at this Red Lobster.  Pros-  * The trio pick 3 for 15.99 was good.  (My son enjoyed that) * The biscuits are always on point * Our waiter (Rob) was great!!!! No issues with him at all  Cons * Wait time was horrible!  So many open seats yet everyone waits a long time! * The Admiral platter was not tasty.  Long John Silver tasted better. * Special drink we ordered tasted more like thick syrup on ice and one little shot of amaretto did the drink no justice * Way OVER priced for mediocre seafood.   * Portions were very small and falsely advertised!!!    So disappointed.  Not a good experience."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to come here for dinner on monday 6-30-2014 we have never been here and wanted to give it a try! the moment our waiter spoke to us he had a attitude problem... we just blew it off and ordered anyways my husband ordered the steak with lobster on top and I ordered coconut shrimp. It was about 7:30 at that time a half hour later still no food and we had finished are tea by this point around 8:20 somebody brings out are food the food was alright nothing great definitely not worth the price! My husbands lobster was so tuff and tasted nasty! We finally had to stop eating cause we had no drinks we waited..and waited finally are waiter comes back and checks in and I asked for some more tea.. and I kid you not!! 15 minutes later he brings tea... are food was cold and by that point I was ready to leave! I've never had such bad service from a restaurant and can not believe how there customer service is we are big tippers and always friendly to the service industry but are waiter was the rudest waiter ive had and completely ruined are date night i would NEVER EVER recommend anybody going here and I will Never be returning."}
{"text":"The food here was fantastic, it was our first time trying food here and we enjoyed our visit. The food came out at a good pace and good! However the service was decent and we hardly seen our server after the food was served ! Would recommend to my friends !"}
{"text":"Queensway Red Lobster is always packed.    front desk staff & the servers are extremely friendly & attentive.  This is our family's fav Red Lobster  Menu:  I love love their Caesar salad with freshly baked garlic cheese biscuits to start with.  For main course I love their blacken Tilapia in Cajun or if I'm in the mood for red meat, their fire-grilled peppercorn sirloin steak medium rare, It is melt in your mouth tender. Other family members would order the ultimate feast and seafood linguini. They never disappoint. Portion is excellent. I find they are getting better at using less salt in the dishes.  Atmosphere:  it is an extremely busy location. It is always packed. Ed always have to wait to be seated but we don't mind.  Busy is a good testament to the restaurant   Price point:  its not the cheapest or the most expensive, good value for your dollar  Would go there again"}
{"text":"We had a nice and funny waiter. We loved the service here, lovely manager.   The appetizer (calamari) -- it was below average. It was too salty that we could not taste the calamari itself. And the calamari was small too!"}
{"text":"Went to dinner tonight, and was extremely disappointed. They were not busy at all, maybe five tables in the restaurant total. We were seated right away, but waited at least ten minutes before our server came to take our drink order. Another fifteen minutes went by before we received our three glasses of water. The service was absolutely horrible. And slow. Our food must've been sitting in the window, waiting to be ran because our food was not hot when we received it. The food itself was OK, nothing special. Not once did our server come check on us. And when we finally paid the bill, he did not bring us the proper change. We will not be back, and I suggest not going here if you are in a hurry, or if you are expecting good service."}
{"text":"Let's just say the commercials do not live up to its tantalizing hype!! Extremely disappointed!!  Food beyond salty. One way to kill seafood is smothered it in salt!!   Will not be a returning customer!!"}
{"text":"food was great but staff was two steps this side of duh!!  Went for wife's birthday in dec. 2015.  asked for manager to set up the birthday etc. got the person behind the register.  Explained that I wanted the singing etc. She said she would be SURE to let my server know!  Then, after the meal, the server actually goes to my wife and asks  \"you don't really want us to sing the birthday song...do you? Spoiled the whole dang evening! !!  I was livid . it was like shaming my wife into letting her off the hook!!   yes, they comped part of the tab but it was still a very bad experience."}
{"text":"Went to Red Lobster last night...my husband had a baked potato that was baked several times over, black and hard as a rock.  The waiter was very nice and changed it out.  My garlic shrimp was translucent, tasteless and limp!  I think they took it out of the freezer and threw it into the microwave.  We won't be going back there for quite awhile...$53.00, including tip."}
{"text":"Service was slow.  Two other tables received their food before us and had mistakes in their orders.  My fries came out about 8 minutes after my entree did.  The shrimp was over battered and the fries were over cooked.  I wouldn't eat here again."}
{"text":"Red Lobster was my go-to restaurant for seafood when we're young with the treasure chest available toys for family dining there. Food as I know back then was a bit better. I still recall the garlic cheese bread being good and a bit salty. The garlic shrimp was very tasty and oily, and the lobster was fine as well. I've been to red lobster many occasion since then, but never put a posting on it, so now is the time.  We came for Lobsterfest where the meals consist mainly lobster. We got two apps, two mains, two beverage.  Beverage: Boston Ice Tea Peach ($3.60). Its basically nestea but with some flavouring. Gf got coffee =P Better at Mc'D!  Apps: Seafood Stuffed Mushroom ($10). This was and still is one of my fav app at this place. Mushroom cap stuffed with a little chunk of seafood and melted cheese. I just enjoy picking up the mushroom and the cheese still stretching, and after finishing this dish, there's still some cheese to scrap up and dip with your garlic bread biscuit!  Lobster Artichoke Dip ($12). Nice cheesy with little chunks of lobster meat. Meat not much i'd say, but still nice app. They tend to give more chip than dip.  Mains: Gf got the surf and turf. ($29.50). The meat is cooked as per request medium rare. But this steak is definitely not as good as a steakhouse...that is where we 'Sea Food Differently' as per their commercial...=) By the way, we got the steak, but the server forgot our lobster tail, so he brought it later, and gave us a discount on this meal based on that action...Nice of him to do that, even though we did not require it. - Interesting thing is the lobster tail was actually cooked well and tasted very fresh and bouncy, and the meat was not sticky to the tail which means the lobster is dying or died earlier prior to being cooked.  Lobster Lovers Dream ($35.80). This is truly something I dream about when I was a kid, except I dreamed of having lobster, crab, scallop, shrimp all in one meal for a soft decent price...But this is close enough.. - This consist of two different lobster tail. One is their standard tail, and the other is  more of the caribbean lobster tail which is a bit bigger and thick. I found my lobsters a bit more tough and rubbery, but not so bad that I won't eat it. - It also comes with lobster chunks in my pasta. Again the lobster meat is not really standing out.  - I also added additional garlic shrimp for $5.50 for large portion which is 10 shrimps...I dunno what happened, but these are literally the smallest shrimps ever. I recall their garlic shrimp being bigger. This is the example: Back then 1995 onwards, garlic shrimp were the size of your adult pinky size... Now 2015, garlic shrimp in 1995 had kids who had grand children and its a third of the size of your pinky!!! No lies!   While I may say our server is easy going and friendly, he did make some simple errors. 1) No water brought throughout the whole service. 2) Requested for their biscuit, and only got it after requesting twice and it came after we're finishing up our apps. 3) Lobster tail that did not come with the steak at the time, but was made up for. Now being this case, I still may come venture for food here when I have that craving from childhood memories...With that said, I still left 20% tip!  btw- i can understand if the server is crazy busy then these mishaps may happen, but we came after 10pm on saturday, and each server only gets 4 table max, whether they're deuces, or four tops, so its hard to excuse the lack of service..."}
{"text":"This is always the Red Lobster my mom chooses for her birthday meal. Every day we've come here (that wasn't a weekend) the service was almost immediate, the staff is always nice and make sure your order is made perfectly. The food is ready before you know it, and the atmosphere is perfect for a family dinner!"}
{"text":"Today I was feeling down and went shopping for some retail therapy on my way home stopped at Red lobster to pick up an order to go. I sat at the bar to place my order and was greeted by one of the most helpful, kind and courteous servers I've ever encountered. I only wish I got his name, on the ticket it says Miles C., his kindness brightened my day. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Best biscuits in the world. Can actually feel my heart slow down from all the fat. The rest of the food is just ok but the biscuits and coconut shrimp make me come back for more."}
{"text":"Dined here with my mother-in-law and husband the other night. It might smell fishy as soon as you walk in because they have a live lobster tank! We had great service from our waitress, Katie. They overcooked my steak and when Katie came back to check on us, we let her know. She notified her manager and I was personally delivered a fresh steak from the kitchen by the chef who asked me to cut into it while he was present. I showed him my old steak and he agreed that it was definitely medium, not medium rare. The manager was fantastic- we complimented our waitress and he was genuinely appreciative. My mother-in-law loves RL so I'm sure we'll be back and hopefully get seated in Katie's section again. Ask for Katie & you'll get great service! No- I'm not related to her at all. I promise!"}
{"text":"If my steak hadn't been chewy and the prices hadn't gone up, I would give this place 5 stars.  It is a seafood place so I forgive them.  We are always seated  quickly, the service is great, and the seafood is always tasty.  You can't beat the lunch specials or the 4 course meal for $17 either.  And the cheddar biscuits are phenomenal as always."}
{"text":"This place is amazing, the food is veryyy good, but the best in this place is the server Nadine (is not the girl , it's the Lady) , she is the best, she is so friendly, with us, and special with our son,  she is focus in the service, and in all details, she is the difference in this restaurant"}
{"text":"The food was good but the service was terrible. The only thing that the server did well was refill our drinks in a timely order."}
{"text":"STEER CLEAR!    My family and I came here to celebrate a birthday in the family.  We made reservations ahead of time. After being seated we ordered drinks and looked over the menus. The drinks took at least 15 minutes to get to our table.  That was even after we actually got up, walked around, found a server (not our own) and asked where our drinks were.    When we all received our meals, we were even more disappointed.  My brother ordered the Ultimate Feast, which comes with crab legs. He had 5 legs on his crab. My brother-in-law ordered the same meal, and only ended up with 3 legs.  Several of us at the table had a side of wild rice pilaf with our meals. All of the rice was stuck together and burned to the point where it was crunchy and not edible.   We told the waitress about the crab leg problem, and she did come back with a fresh plate of crab legs for my brother-in-law, but did nothing about the rice. The shrimp was dry and over-cooked.    Overall, the meals were over $25 each, and with seven of us coming to over $175 worth of food, that was over-cooked, dry, and missing components.  Next time, we'll celebrate somewhere else. i will never come back to Red Lobster after this experience.  There are much better, fresh, and authentic seafood restaurants in the valley."}
{"text":"I don't know what has happened to RL, but the food is not nearly as good as it used to be, with the exception of the cheddar bay biscuits. My last two visits there were very disappointing. The food was bland. The lobster was tough and lacked flavor. Not interested in returning."}
{"text":"veggies overcooked but would assume that with no doubt. at any chain restaurant most veggies are overcooked. i have never been to red lobster so had to try it eventually. the commercials got me, not gonna lie. great marketing! lobsters fest commercial = winning...   my brother got one of the lobster fest specials and i got another. lobster was good, slightly over cooked, but good portion size and for $30 i wasn't complaining at all.  brother saw a commercial and you get a free app if you sign up online so we got stuffed mushrooms for free, so thats always a +  service = great. we had a server named kim. she was so funny and made the experience memorable. great sense of humor and clowned on my brother the whole lunch for asking for the free app after we ordered. AWESOME to anyone clowning on my brother."}
{"text":"I tried Red Lobster food  for the first time and I was not impressed with my order. I ordered the Broiled Seafood Platter TO GO and it was disappointing. My review relies mostly on the food. I was expecting restaurant food, not fast food. The fries were thin and chewy, the shrimp was a little bigger than a quarter but flavorful, and the scallops were just plain. Overall the food was not worth the price.   I would give this location 2 stars but because my server/cashier provided great customer service, I'm giving 3 stars."}
{"text":"The wait was reasonable and understanding but once we were seated the server took a while to take our orders. The first part of service was OK, but the food took about an hour an half to come out. When it did come out I noticed our food has been microwaved for example the knife on my plate was very hot and my mash potatoes were hard.They also messed up on my girl friends order twice and didn't apologize. Furthermore, I was very unhappy with the service and food. I would recommend maybe another location or another restaurant."}
{"text":"One star only because that's the lowest I can rate as I get ready to have my stomach pumped at the emergency room.  There were 8 of us attempting to celebrate my father in laws 79th bday. The service was atrocious. The food was barely palatable due to the excessive salt used to prepare it. The iced tea was the only thing that wasn't salty. The shrimp in the trio was mealy and tasted like frozen shrimp defrosted before served. The battered fried shrimp wasn't even Costco brand. The orders were wrong with asparagus instead of broccoli. Where to stop dissecting and find a good except the occasion, I can't figure out. Finally, to top it off we spent over $300 with tip and wasn't worth $30. Huge disappointment and waste of hard earned money. I have absolutely no idea how that place was so busy. There are so many better seafood and restaurants in general that deserve patronage. Never ever spend a dime on red lobster.  In fact I have taken the left over lemons in a doggie bag and next time I even drive by a red lobster I plan on squeezing them into my eyes to avoid seeing this place."}
{"text":"I'm writing you this letter to let you know what an exceptional experience my family and I had at your restaurant on the evening of August 6th 2014.  My family and I came to celebrate my mothers 61st birthday. Upon entering your establishment we were greeted by one of your friendly female hostesses (I'm now sorry I didn't get her name) she was a friendly woman with a nice smile. She looked to be in her late 40's with short red hair. She greeted us and immediately showed us to our table.   A short time after being seated we were greeted by our waitress Colleen W. who was absolutely extraordinary.  Colleen was prompt, very friendly, knew the menu items well but most of all, she was very patient with us (a party of 6 people) Colleen kept her smile the entire time and never once looked to be agitated or annoyed.  We immediately got the feeling that Colleen is a very genuine person and is very good at her job. Several of the comments made by my family members and I while we spoke at dinner were as follows: \"our waitress is very good..., you can tell she's a genuine person..., all servers should be like her..., Wow! she pays very close attention to detail\" I couldn't agree more!! Colleen kept our glasses filled the entire time and made our mothers' birthday dinner one of the best!!  Of course we can't forget to compliment the kitchen and how delicious our meals were.  Everything was cooked to our liking and we enjoyed our seafood dinners very much. I plan to share this exceptional experience on my media networks i.e. Yelp, Urbanspoon, Facebook, etc.... Thanks again to all of  the RED LOBSTER staff members who made our evening out to dinner one of the best!!"}
{"text":"I like this place . Can't go wrong with red lobster. I mean we never order the steak and streamed lobster here just because I feel like it would tasted better cooked at home. The staff is nice and friendly. We ordered seafood pastas. They turned out great. We also love coming here for oysters, best day to come for oysters is on a Friday. They even do oysters for pick up as well."}
{"text":"Delicious lobster nachos and berry sangria! And Matt our server was super nice and funny too."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to crab legs. Apparently Red Lobster only has two crab crackers in the entire restaurant. They said we could just break them with our hands. You've got to be kidding me!"}
{"text":"Totally disappointed! Have been eating here for 3 years without complaints but this visit was way below par. The server was very polite and efficient but the food was less than desirable. When I commented that the biscuits were a lot smaller than they've ever been, the response was \"well, they're unlimited!\" That really wasn't the point. The clam chowder tasted more like unseasoned potato soup, little if any clam taste. My dining companion had crab legs, which I what they always order, and said the meat was unusually soft. The crab also came with a lot of the legs separated from the joint. Is this new management or a different cook. They need change if they expect regulars to return."}
{"text":"Never returning to this place again. The ditzy blonde waitress messed up our order. It took us 90 minutes before we were able to leave because they were absolutely slow. When we told her we needed change, she came back and said, \"oh, did you want change?\" I swear, Darden needs to start drug testing the clowns that work here. They pretty much keep the lights off too, so it's a lousy setting."}
{"text":"Came in on a Wednesday night and had great service by savannah!!!!!! Was super attentive and gave great service all around!!!! Will be back."}
{"text":"I have never been disappointed at a Red Lobster! The food is great and the service is exceptional. This visit was no different.  Peggy was awesome. Space was clean and comfortable. Nice night."}
{"text":"I called and asked if I could make reservations for 9 of us on a Friday evening for my   husband's birthday. I was told they do not take reservations but I could get my name on a list. I talked to a gentleman there and he assured me that he would put my name on the list. He asked what time we would arrive and told him 7pm. I told him that we had not been to a Red Lobster in at least 25 years. He said we should have a nice time and no real problem getting in. I called back on Friday and again they told me that my name was on the list. When we got there at 7pm for our dinner we were told  - not sure how log the wait would be - and most likely at least a 45 minute wait.  What happened to the name on the list?  The two girls at the front desk did not seem to care - in fact, rude in my opinion. We left and went across the street to Azteca and had a very nice meal.  It's going to be another 25 years before I go to Red Lobster again."}
{"text":"The wait staff is fantastic ,however the management is rude and unprofessional. The managers have no customer service or people skills and are quick to assume every body wants something  for free! My experience was terrible and I will not return!"}
{"text":"A friend and I met for dinner at this Red Lobster yesterday.  Meeting at 5:30pm, I was prepared to wait a while for a table, but we were pleasantly surprised to be seated right away.  Our waitress, Lisa, was delightful.  She helped us make our dinner selections, and we were very happy with her recommendations.  The lobster mac and cheese is definitely a winner!  My friend and I have not seen each other in a while and had a lot of catching up to do.  We didn't leave the restaurant until 9pm. During that time,  I was careful to keep an eye on the dining area to see if other customers were waiting for a table, but that was not an issue.  Plenty of available tables and booths for customers.  We never felt rushed or pressured to leave.  We were able to relax and enjoy our dinner and   conversation."}
{"text":"The snow crabs must be boiled in salt water because they were the most salty crab legs I have ever tasted"}
{"text":"So we showed up and was told there will be a 20 min wait for a party of 6. After walking around for 30 min (still 20 to go I was just told) they have left five 6 tops vacant the entire time. Either they are severely understaffed or just straight up lazy. Congrats Melissa Baca. You are failing miserably as a manager!"}
{"text":"First and final visit to this location.  Peach tea and cheese biscuits were fantastic and our server was wonderful, bringing my 1 star to 2.  Ordered fish and chips.  Breading was easily 30% of dish with one huge area too crisp to cut.  Fish was mushy, no fish taste, aroma, or texture.  Nary a flake.  Tartar sauce did not make it edible as it tasted like coleslaw.  I had my dining partner verify this.  My meal WAS comped as it should have been.  I never write bad restaurant reviews but this one needed noted."}
{"text":"Great service here. Our server actually humoured us as we waited for my family for two hours before ordering. But she did get us on a stiff drink bill. Anyway, everybody loved their seafood and I stuck with my chicken fingers. Which makes me sound like a child, I know, but I don't care for seafood, which is why I moved to Calgary from Halifax. Good steak. But, even though I didn't enjoy the seafood, I won't forget the service. It was quick and pleasant and she even put up with my belligerent cousin with a friendly smile."}
{"text":"Outstanding service and teamwork with employees! Tina, our waitress, was friendly& quick! We met both managers who introduced themselves and asked how everything was. We used a gift card and coupon, but still left a great tip! Food was hot, fresh and yummy. We left with leftovers ( doesn't happen much) we will request Tina next visit!"}
{"text":"My Husband and I went there for Valentines. The restaurant was pretty empty when we arrived. Our server was quite a Character making funny jokes every 3 seconds. The food was great! We shared a lobster pizza which is the best I have ever eaten. I had barbecued shrimp and chicken and my husband had shrimp scampi. Both where excellent!! I can't wait to go back!!!"}
{"text":"I brought a party of 12 to this restaurant for my birthday. It was a very disappointing experience! The food was cold, steaks were over cooked, half of our party was done eating before the other half was served!!! I don't recommend this restaurant at all!!"}
{"text":"pretty cool restaurant, I went there with my friends from scotland last year and they had these really nice little cheese biscuits that they give you before your meal.    Very nice"}
{"text":"Last night was the 5th time in 12 years of living down the road from this RL, that we've dined there - it will be our last. It was a bad experience for the three of us: the server brought out two waters for three people. I was anticipating a quick turnaround for the third water - it never came. That's where the bad experience started, it didn't improve, but got worse. My lobster bisque was exceedingly salty (and I like salt) - 4 minutes later they brought out my wife's salad meal in a very modest sized salad bowl. Her second bite she looks at me \"this is all I get?\" \"I don't know?\" Sunny, our server, never stopped to ask how things were, or if we had any questions. And 7 minutes later they brought out my kid's meal.  When the meals are ordered at the same time, you anticipate that they'll be served at the same time. Not here.   Sad, but I won't be back."}
{"text":"Solid seafood place.  I had the tilapia last visit in July 2014 and it was tasty.  The service is good but not exceptional on our average visit.  I could call this 3.5 stars quite honestly.  The one thing that could help them out I think is having more variety of fish, they usually have salmon, mahi mahi or flounder sometimes, tilapia and one other fish fry generic fish like a cod.  I would love to see them get things like grouper or sea bass, or ever more tasty fish for a weekly special like monkfish or barramundi.  But overall a solid night out for a decent price for what you get."}
{"text":"My family and I went here for my birthday. Absolutely delicious!!! My mother and I shared the bar harbour seafood bake. Huge portions!! Service was absolutely amazing. Always a great dining experience."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I visited for the first time ever on Thursday. I work for Darden, so I was expecting great service and delicious food. The food was nothing amazing, but it was still a decent value for the price. However, our waiter was extremely rude. He acted like it was a burden to serve us. I'm assuming it was our age, but that shouldn't matter. I'm a server myself and it's wrong to treat your guests like they are wasting your time. It made the entire experience quite disappointing."}
{"text":"Awful, overcooked lobster and terrible service.  App brought with our dinner and after asking for the melted warm butter for our lobster that they forgot the server brought 3 packets of cold butter meant for bread. Acted put off when we asked for the proper butter. Avoid this place,  thank God we had gift cards and didn't waste our money"}
{"text":"I would think of all places Red Lobster would know how to make Fish and Chips, apparently not.  My husband and I both ordered them on Memorial Day, and regretted it walking out.  We took it home to our dogs it was that bad.  First place, it is one piece with a ton of grease on your plate and maybe 10 French Fries, the tarter sauce was so sweet, why would you do that ?   I wish now we would have just went to Long John Silvers, it probably would have been so much better and not $30 to feed our dogs fish.  NOW, we remember why we don't go here."}
{"text":"Really good lobsters I really love them I love never been here before but this place is amazing man the hospitality the environment everyone is so nice to you  And the food is amazing cant go wrong eat here man"}
{"text":"Numerous tables empty and had people waiting way to long to be seated for no reason, poor management!"}
{"text":"We come here for special occasions or just because and the service and food are consistent every time. We bring our young children with us and the wait staff is great. They even let our girls touch the lobsters :) Not what I would consider your typical place to go to with small children but they are accommodating. The cheddar bay biscuits are always good. Would come back again and again!"}
{"text":"The best restaurant chain that knows how to ruin seafood. Entrees are either breaded/fried or broiled then drowned in butter or choked in some creamy cheesy material. All these is a subliminal message that seafood they use might not be fresh. The lobster is always rubbery. The shrimp is always salty. Their biscuit is the only thing going for them."}
{"text":"Just stopped by here today for lunch with my colleagues and what can I say, it has been months since I've been at Red Lobster and they never leave me disappointed!   The service I received was great, she was extremely friendly and well knowledgeable of the menu itself. While for the food, the portion size was a great size and for the food itself it was delicious, especially the biscuits! Yum yum!    However I did notice there was a price increase since the last time I went which was in February 13', but the portion size still remain the same. But I will definitely still come back here often for lunch despite the increase in price!"}
{"text":"Walked in shack like whoa! There is Schnaggians on the wall, this place seems fun. Then we hear a screeching siren announcing another birthday of a crab cracker. Sooooo loud. Started with the Calamari, basially Van De Camps fish sticks. Said oh well, lets get crackin.  Got the shrimp PO Boy, shrimp was lookin like some swamp shrimp, black and had goopys. EWWW. We told our server\" Hey look,  we are just gonna pay for drinks left. The whole time waiting for the check, we heard an echo of sorry... Sorry sorry."}
{"text":"This is a favourite. The waiting time is usually 15 min on a weekend evening as they are usuallly very busy but there areas to sit and wait. Good service and very fresh food.  It is one of the few restaurants left where you can have a large meal and even a drink for 2 people for under 50 dollars."}
{"text":"Food was amazing & portions were extremely fair. Our waitress \"Janis\" was so friendly & gracious. We will definitely be going back"}
{"text":"Keep your expectations in check, and you'll walk away with a positive experience. This is Red Lobster. Its not Vancouver, nor is it Halifax. Its Toronto. The food is good, the service is good, and the place is clean. Consistantly. The prices are fair, and the biscuits are addictive. Even though its called Red Lobster, there is something for everyone."}
{"text":"The service was very slow, and the food took forever to come out. We had to ask for biscuits 3 times and we got the check they brought the biscuits to the table."}
{"text":"Great service bad food. My husbands was over cooked and mine under cooked and came back under cooked again!  Clam chowder was like water. $117!  Not going back. No thank you."}
{"text":"I have had better service at petes fish and chips. She brought the salad and food at the same time wih no rolls. We told them to hold the food until we had our salad and when they brought the food it was cold.. Should have gone to McDonald's and had a fish sandwich. At least you know what to expect."}
{"text":"Don't go here if you expect fresh seafood. This is pretty much similar to how Olive Garden calls themselves an Italian restaurant. The food is fried and greasy, and overpriced for the food that you get. The only thing that is craveable are the biscuits."}
{"text":"The worst service in Ohio.  22 minutes to get drinks and then my ice tea had a clump of butter in it.  The place was 50% full so being busy is not the excuse. Lazy and not caring....  Stay far away from this place."}
{"text":"Been awhile and needed my seafood fix, love the food and atmosphere here. Returning costumer for years."}
{"text":"I have been here many times before but today was amazing, the food tastes like the 4th of July in your mouth, the service from our waiter keven was amazing I couldn't have asked for a better waiter"}
{"text":"Had not been in awhile but couldn't resist crabfest. Calamari nasty we didn't even eat it or take it with us. My daughter steak was hard and over done. All the crab legs were itsy bitsy teeny wheeny. The dungenous was over cooked and tasted like it was soaked in water all day and was mushy. I am overly disappointed and hope they get it together until then I will eat at other places like Joes crabpot for comparable pricing."}
{"text":"I love the Garlic/Chedder biscuits and the Rock lobster is always cooked to perfection!       A++"}
{"text":"I do not recommend this Red Lobster; I got the crab cakes and they were cold and bland. The service was not very good and I didn't feel we got what we paid for. They were pretty friendly so I'll give them that but overall I just wasn't very satisifed with the experience and I won't be going back..not to this location at least."}
{"text":"Service here is awesome. Food comes to your table hot, fresh, and put on the plate with care. Made obviously by people that love there job/career. Drinks are good too, and its a place I love to come to when I am in this area. ( Been here at this location 4 times in a 2 year criteria )"}
{"text":"2 ** for the food but I'll bump it up because of those dang biscuits 5 ***** for the service  I've never been to a Red Lobster before. NYC doesn't have many of these big chain restaurants and I'd been feeling a bit deprived, what with everyone talking about how awesome the biscuits are here. (Funny how nobody raves about the amazing lobster at Red Lobster.)  Stephanie C., Kat T. and I went here for lunch just to try the biscuits. And, yes! They are indeed delicious. They're served warm and have a mild cheesy crust with a fluffy interior that pulls apart like cashmere yarn. Be careful, though; the grease on the biscuits is uncontainable and will ooze all over your hands and soak through your napkins.  Too bad the rest of the food that I actually paid for didn't measure up to the complimentary biscuits. The New England clam chowder was gloppy and most likely thickened by flour instead of real cream. The shrimp garden salad was sad, almost like what you'd find in an unreplenished salad bar at 4 p.m. Overall, not a bad deal at $9.99 for the two at lunch but I wouldn't eat it again.  One thing Red Lobster does right is in training its staff. Every point of contact from the hostess to our server, Joe, was friendly, professional and engaging. Joe is the nicest waiter I've come across in a long time but, more importantly, he does his job well.   He even gave each of us a bag of warmed biscuits to take home and for that I gave him my eternal gratitude and a 30% tip."}
{"text":"Two weeks ago I tried the lobster pizza.  At first I wasn't a huge fan, but later on I developed a  craving for it.  So I ordered it again via carryout.  We also ordered a flounder dinner with a salad and baked potato.  The cheddar biscuits were also included.  I tore into the cheddar biscuits as I was starving.  They were okay.  Though they are never as good as they are in the restaurant as they cool on the car ride home.  Then I opened the pizza.  I was initially happy to see it appeared to be crunchier than the last one I ordered.  I like my pizza on the crunchier side.  Then I tasted it and realized it had been sitting out and probably reheated, thus creating a crunchier appearance.  The baked potato with the flounder dinner was small and shriveled.  It also appeared to have been reheated.   Upon calling to let them know, the hostess did apologize and told us we could get a refund.  When we returned the food, the manager didn't apologize and merely gave us a refund.   We might've been willing to try it again if we'd been offered an apology from the manager.  We won't be returning."}
{"text":"Great food.  Very busy at around 7:00 pm when we went there.  Their 30/45 shrimp meal deal is defiantly worth it. The Cheddar Bay Biscuits are addicting, as always.  The server was a bit slow when it came to bringing out things that needed refilled or replaced... example: drink refills and biscuits.  But other than that, defiantly worth the wait.  Very clean restaurant. Friendly and welcoming staff.  Will defiantly go there again."}
{"text":"I ordered the ultimate feast... (I thought I am going to get a lot of seafood..)... very disappointed the portion of plate compare to the \"model\" picture on the menu....is a shrinking version. Very small lobster tail...size of shrimps are small. Not even close to the picture on the menu....very disappointed. I did not complain. I am simply won't go back to red lobster resturant."}
{"text":"Broccoli was overly buttered and salted.  Actually all the food was.  The vegetables were undercooked or over cooked.  The food is drowning in salt and butter."}
{"text":"We went there to celebrate my birthday and I was really disappointed on my visit . I had great cravings for shrimp and crab so thought it would be the best place to visit but I was wrong .The quality of the food was very poor and the taste was not up to the expectation as per my last visit in Wisconsin . The taste was so different and the food did not look that appealing as its shown on the TV when we visited the place . But I do really appreciate the ambience it was clean and well maintained.    We had endless shrimp and I ordered parmesan shrimp and Korean BBQ shrimp . Both were its worst. The parmesan shrimp was too oily and didn't taste any parmesan. It was like some herb on deep fried shrimp that's  it. And the Korean BBQ shrimp was the worst. I could only smell the burt woodstick with absolute no BBQ sauce on it.  Don't be fooled by all the advertise they show on the TV. Finally I feel that its not worth the value we give."}
{"text":"I regularly eat garbage, but this made me sick.   In all honesty, I've eaten here 3 times and each time had minor food poisoning. Any other RL and I have been fine."}
{"text":"Visited for lunch yesterday- worst mistake ever.  The food was good when we finally got it but the service was horrible."}
{"text":"I was surprised in a good way. Four of us went there for my daughter-in-laws birthday. I haven't been to a red lobster in over 15 years. It was 5 o'clock on Wednesday night. The restaurant was relatively quiet - about 20% full of diners. We were seated promptly. The waiter took our drink order within minutes. Appetizers came out within five minutes and our meals were out within 20 minutes. We went for lobster fest, and we were not disappointed. The lobsters were perfectly broiled; the shrimp or perfectly steamed, and the sirloin steak was as I ordered it-medium rare. The string beans with sun-dried tomatoes were excellent. And the only disappointment was that the mashed potatoes were cold and lumpy. Our waiter was very attentive and cordial. We all had an enjoyable evening."}
{"text":"I have nothing against this restaurant. What I do have a problem with is the hostess lying about the wait time. I get it, it's busy, it's the weekend, and it's Mothers day. Who doesn't want to celebrate their mom with great food? But when you say 45mins as a wait time then make sure it's 45mins.  When you tell us it'll be another 10mins because you have to clean up the table, don't tell us that they're just getting up and about to pay when eve waited for both of the times you've told us. Get a better hostess or know what to tell your customers that are waiting the correct time!  As a former hostess myself, I understand how stressful it can be. But not once have I lied about the waiting time. If customers turn their back because they don't want to wait that long, then let them leave. Don't rush and give us crappy service when we haven't even been seated to our table yet."}
{"text":"The water at the Bell rd red lobster has the worst tasting water I have ever tasted in Arizona . I had the soup and salad and the salad had brown lettuce so not very appetizing"}
{"text":"We had an excellent meal.  Our appetizer came after our entrees & the manager delivered it stating he was taking it off our bill.  This wasn't an issue for us.  After 2 baskets of biscuits, salad & chowder, we really didn't need the appetizer anyway.  Our entrees were prepared perfectly.  Our waitress, Megan, was sweet and attentive.  I didn't catch the manager's name, but he was proactive with immediately noticing the appetizer coming out after our meal before we even had the chance to say anything.  I can see an improvement since they have parted ways with Darden Companies.  We love this Red Lobster."}
{"text":"I had a great lunch today   I just like it ! Food was so big fun and tasty !! Service was nothing I have complain about .. Our server was very kind ! I haven't came to this place loooooong time so I'm happy to came back again !  We had a big lobster plate and shrimp plate ! We eat alooooot ! But we couldn't finish everything !"}
{"text":"When we got to red lobster it was noon mid day. Not busy at all. Me and my husband were seated very quickly. Our server had a friendly smile. She also told us about the menu, gave us a moment to decide on what beverage we would like to indulge in. She was perfect with timing.we placed our orders. In the mean time biscuits were fresh and yummy. Salad was nice and crisp. Entrée was nice and hot. We did not order desert, my only con the garlic shrimp was over seasoned I couldn't eat it at all. I would come back. my husband and my  meal came to about 65.00 we also ordered bar drinks as well."}
{"text":"I am not a huge fan of Red Lobster. My husband is though, so whenever we go here it's because he wants to. Last Saturday night he was in the mood for crab legs so I suggested we place a to go order & he agreed. I checked out their menu online & saw that it was Lobsterfest, so that got me in the mood for some.   For an app we ordered the new england seafood sampler, which consisted of lobster & crab stuffed mushrooms, fried clam strips & bacon wrapped scallops. The shrooms were bomb, clam strips were ok & I didn't really care for the scallops. For his entree my hubby ordered the ultimate feast with an extra half pound of snow crab legs (which he ended up sharing with a friend drunk at 3am, ha!). I ordered the bar harbor lobster & shrimp trio. Both meals came with a salad & their delicious biscuits. Hubs & our friend Chris enjoyed every last bite of their crab legs, lobster tail & shrimp. I could only eat half of mine because there was so much of it, but the lobster tail was yummy & so was the shrimp. The parmesan lobster & shrimp bake seemed good at first, but an hour or so later my stomach was not agreeing with me, too rich!  Total for everything was $70+. A bit over priced for this establishment but knowing my hubby, we'll be back."}
{"text":"My family and I \"were\" having a nice expensive lunch at Red Lobster, then the waiter mayo on my entire family. His response, I am terribly sorry about that and then made a crack joke saying that if we were sitting somewhere else we would not have any on us. He didn't refund the cost of our meal after his rude comment and getting us dirty which ruined our day as we all had to go home and shower. I WILL NOT BE COMING BACK TO RED LOBSTER AFTER THIS INCIDENT!"}
{"text":"Recently gave this Red Lobster in Madison a second try as the first time the food was awful.  This time around I ordered the fish lunch special instead of the rubbery bland lobster.  The best part of my lunch was the caesar salad. A fresh good fish doesn't taste or smell \"fishy\" and this one did even the texture was mushy and the rice pilaf was hard bland pebbles. Rather than get sick I pushed the plate away, barely touched. The cheddar biscuits were way to salty and I love salt. I have eaten at many different Red Lobsters in different states over the years and this is the worst. I've had great food everytime I ate at the one in Rockford,IL over many years. I'll make that drive next time I need my lobster fix. 1 star for the salty biscuits is a  1/2 star too much."}
{"text":"I used to be a BIG FAN of red lobster as I;m a seafood lover but things need to be IMPROVED! My husband and I went here for lobster fest this week and he ordered the lobster lover's dream which came with 1 rock lobster tail, 1 split lobster tail, and lobster and shrimp linguine alfredo.he liked the lobster and I shared the pasta with him and it was BLAND.. and the little shrimps they put in there taste like the kind you eat from frozen bags you buy at the Chinese grocery stores... I ordered my own trio: sole (stuffed with rice, cheese and broccoli), garlic shrimp and scallops (FOR WHICH I PAID EXTRA 3.99).. the best part of my dish was the sole and the shrimp - ive had these before so they are my go to items to order but the scallops were new - had not seen them on the menu before and was eager to try them but they were served COLD and they were so BLAND and OVERCOOKED it felt like biting into solid water... not impressed at all and not happy that I paid a surcharge for them... will not be ordering those again!"}
{"text":"Food was very good got there early enough and beat Valentines Day rush"}
{"text":"Yummmy! the food here is excellent I'm a total seafood fan! so I can't get enough lobster, crab and, shrimp!  I do prefer funky, higher end places, but the service here is AMAZING and we go for the food, not the atmosphere. It's a bit on the casual side and the dress code is uber casual, which is great for a quick drop in.   Been here a ton and everytime we go we get excellent service and we walk out with our bellies full!  Great job guys!"}
{"text":"Disappointed. We had an issue with one of our dinning experience and we reached as far out to General Management, but unfortunately that issue was never resolved, and never felt that the management had 100% commitment in resolving that issue. For that, this location of Red Lobster is one we will never dine at, and even more so we will never dine with Red Lobster again."}
{"text":"My favourite restaurant. I went to the McLeod Trail location today after a very long day, and I am glad I did. We got great food and wonderful service which is a rarity these days. Our server was cheerful friendly and prompt. Thanks for making my day end on a brighter note Morgan."}
{"text":"My foodie daughter thinks chain restaurants are beneath her, but now and then my son-in-law and I prevail upon her to eat at Red Lobster. They have the best Bloody Marys in the world (get a Virgin Mary if you don't drink.)  The salads are good but would benefit from some greens other than iceberg lettuce. The blue cheese dressing is divine.  I also love,love, love those Cheddar Bay biscuits.  I usually get the salmon and a baked potato, and they also serve a side of broccoli, so it's all fairly nutritious.  Servers are usually attentive and always friendly.  It gets a little crowded and loud in there for my tastes, and the parking lot is usually jammed full.  Sometimes I like to sneak in there alone in mid-afternoon on a weekday when there's not so many people around."}
{"text":"I had a wonderful lunch today. The quality of the food was great and our server, San, was exceptional. It's refreshing to have such a wonderful server to make the dining experience great."}
{"text":"I see other customers have had the same complaint that I have regarding the salty lobster.  It had about 3 times the amount of salt that it should.  Not only unsavoury, but also very unhealthy.  Much of the food at Red Lobster restaurant is heavy in butter, and butter already has a lot of salt in in.  So why are they adding MORE salt?   I mentioned this to the manager of the location where we ate, and he said that the amounts of the ingredients are determined by the corporate head offices and they are not allowed to deviate.  I sincerely hope that the corporate head chefs read these reviews and adjust their recipes accordingly.  The delicious looking baby potatoes also ended up being too salty.  Everything looked great, but was ruined by the amount of salt they add.  The waitress, the friendly manager, and customer service were great."}
{"text":"Not a fan of this place.  I find red lobster food overly oily and salty.  The wait staff is nice though so I still come here periodically."}
{"text":"Went here because my friends wanted to. I asked our server how much a specific drink was since they don't put prices on the menu and he said \"Oh, $5, maybe some change\", I thought it was reasonable enough and got one and it ended up being $6.99. It may sound stupid but this really bothered me because I wouldn't have ordered it if I had known it was actually $7 for a shot of rum with some fruit juice. I'm a server in a similar price range restaurant and know what it's like so I don't expect a server to have every price of everything memorized but just check and come back if you don't know. If that wasn't the case then he just flat out lied which I also don't appreciate. Entree tasted okay but was overpriced. The salad looked pretty pathetic and like it was from an elementary school cafeteria...small amount of cheap bagged salad with one big dressing blob in the middle. Darden should probably spend less on interior decorating and more on fresh food."}
{"text":"Fiancée and I were out eating I love the food.. but I hate that I had to ask the server for new glasses and silverware twice..(grit and water stains all over it) other then that the food was great.."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch and stood by the waiting station for a long time...I went to the area where one can see me standing by to be seated.  Employees won't even give you a time of day to tell you that they will get someone to seat you!  Finally someone came in by the waiting station  and I scuffled on by to get her attention! She won't even look at me to tell me she was just checking in and that she will get someone to seat me....she had on her earplug and went on her merry way without acknowledging my presence!  I thought that was really odd for an employee to behave in nonchalant way!  The place is kind of outdated and needs new clean carpet! I have to admit though, that once they got me seated and told them I was on my lunch break, the server was very accommodating and friendly."}
{"text":"Buzz girl was terrible, mean, and try to kick customer out on November 11, 2017 around 5pm. I watch 15 minute, she tried to be very mean to all customer, her word description was terrible. However, food and server are excellent as usual."}
{"text":"It's been years since I've been to Red Lobster.    But with TV commercials running to advertise \"Endless Shrimp\" festival, as well as talk that this is the last year this is on offer, we felt a visit was in order.    We purposely went at an early hour (445pm) to avoid any waits in line (I've heard that Endless Shrimp brings in the crowds).  It was explained to us that there were about 6 varieties of shrimps that you can order \"endlessly\":  two entrees at a time: -  Grilled garlic sriracha -  hand-breaded -  parmesan peppercorn -  garlic -  shrimp alfredo The price for Endless Shrimp is ~$23 per person.  The order came with their basket of biscuits (yum!) as well as a side.  Two of us ordered roasted Brussel Sprouts (+$1.99) as our side, while another added a cup of soup (+~$3?).  We ordered a variety of shrimps to share, but ultimately settled on the parmesan peppercorn and garlic shrimps as winners.  I felt that the sriracha on these shrimps had a funny taste (and I put sriracha on most things that I eat), so asked for the refill to be just grilled without the extra sauce, and they were happy to comply.  Our server (Barb) was great - the minute she put our plates down, she asked if we'd like another order.  The first order came with 6-7 shrimps;  the \"refills\" were a little smaller (the shrimps were fairly tiny - small to medium in size).  So the wait between refills were minimal, and she told us we were pretty lightweight when we stopped after 3 or 4 orders.  She mentioned that there was a reservation for a group in the dining room that evening, with a trophy to be given out.  The winner apparently doesn't pay as the others in the group foots the bill for the winner - too funny!  She said they come every year, and there are folks who have 20+ orders.  I think it was with that thought that we suddenly felt very full!  We asked if it was true that this is likely the last year of Endless Shrimp and she said that's what she heard too.  (I'm thinking a few of these parties ordering 20+ refills per person would do Red Lobster in!)  So for those of you who have nostalgia about Endless Shrimp, run to Red Lobster!!"}
{"text":"I hate to say I have to give a 3 because it would have been a 4.5 until we were walking out. Dinner was tainted by not 1 not 2 but 3 people standing by cash register and not 1 of them acknowledged us in any way. Totally changed my opinion of this restaurant. You need to have employees that treat your guests  correctly. Makes me think twice about ever coming back..by the way this was 1st time back to this restaurant for us in 20 years. Last time there service was THAT bad. We had gift certificate only reason we came back. Waiter was good..gave 20% tip..food was good..but that last representation of your restaurant..very poor..very uninviting..I worked in customer service 28 years..I would have fired them all..one looked right at us..nothing ...poor training.  Doubt we will back..too many friendly places to eat. Sorry."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times in the last couple of months and I have to say that their service here is amazing.  From the friendly hostess to the wonderful wait staff. Food is always brought out in a timely manner. Your drinks will be refilled without you asking for it. Even if you do the AYCE option, your server is there before you even finish your dish to make sure your next dish comes out as soon as you are done! Love coming to this location. It is ALWAYS busy so if you do come try to make it there a bit earlier."}
{"text":"Well, i came here to eat there bread and the clam chowder soup. Other dishes are completely regular and less than expected."}
{"text":"I went here for a special date with my boyfriend and the experience was great! We were seated quickly. The food was perfect, and our waiter was very helpful. The prices are reasonable and I would definately recommend Champaign's Red Lobster Restaurant!"}
{"text":"If u like red lobster this place shud be good. First time trying red lobster and didn't like the food or price they offer for it. Can get better food at other restaurants but if ur seafood person maybe this is the place"}
{"text":"Went with a friend who loves Red Lobster. I had fish tacos and was pleasantly surprised. The tacos were well prepared, but not exceptionally flavourful. A bit more heat may have helped. The service was excellent.  Overall: I'm not a big fan of this kind of seafood/fish chain resto, but if this is your thing, you'll probably enjoy the predictable flavours.  Atmosphere ** Service **** Food ***"}
{"text":"excellent as always. endless shrimp is exactly that.  never thought I would say I can not eat more shrimp! good service considering we came in during the diner rush. decor always makes me feel comfortable."}
{"text":"decided to go to dinner for my 21st birthday. worst experience ever. we brought in a table of 14. spent over $300 and they wouldn't serve me one drink. obviously if you turn 21 on a saturday you can't go to the freaking dmv.  thanks for ruining my birthday red lbster with your stupid policy. every where else has at least a 10 day grace period to update your id. manager didn't offer any compensation for our  inconvenience. overall food and server was satisfactory."}
{"text":"The wait staff is very rude. The food is either too cold or burned. Waste of perfectly good seafood. Won't ever go back to this location."}
{"text":"Once again with lobsterfest, I usually go for it every year but this time i felt it was special. Every thing we had was tasty. I didn't know if that's bcoz not many people came here on the game day (final four) and chefs were not too busy so that they were very focus on our dishes.  However it was  my great day. We got a free appetizer which was a bowl of garlic mussels.  I would say I really liked it but the side bread was too salty for us. We had wood-grilled lobster,  shrimp and salmon and  lobster lover's dream to share.  I usually don't feel craving for pasta but for this time I had to give the thumb up for the chefs. Awesome!"}
{"text":"Service and atmosphere were just fine, but the main reason I go to a restaurant is for the food.  If this were a fast food or pseudo fast food joint (i.e., fast food pricing), I'd give it maybe 3 stars.  But I spent 50 + bucks for my wife and I and the food was abysmal. We ordered 1. The calamari appetizer: it was that mushy soggy type. 2. The Cesar salad that comes with an entree: drenched in dressing and also soggy.  3. Clam chowder: this was terrible. I love clam chowder of all kinds, but this had that canned soup taste and it was creamy in appearance but thin to the palate.  4. The rolls that come with the meal were like eating salt licks.    On the other hand my wife's dish was fairly good and consisted of grilled garlic shrimp, peppercorn steak and crab legs but the portion was small.  Her meal is why I would be inclined to give it 3 stars IF IT WERE A FAST FOOD JOINT.  I'll never go back."}
{"text":"Good place for sea food dining. Price is reasonable and portions quire large. Comes with free biscuits which makes it all the better"}
{"text":"Went to this location on Father's Day.  Had to wait but we expected such.  Had the shrimp trio:  the breaded shrimp was very salty as were the red potatoes.  The potatoes were over cooked and mushy in the middle --- not very tasty.  The waitress came to our table only once during our meal.  Won't be back and recommend others not to waste their time and money here.  After this visit I can understand why the chain is having problems..."}
{"text":"This red lobster location is run by the \"half a brain\" club.  Always something wrong. The location on dumdas and 427 is almost always perfect, but this location has at least one issue every time.. We try to avoid this location as much as pissible.. Heres a list of issues we get with our 120.00 dinner for two bill: -dry crab thats like leather -off lobster thats smells off and resembles cottage cheese -reheated,old, sweet chilli shrimp - cold soup - stale bread - brown salad - ransid butter  Have encountered all issues mentioned (a beit not on a single night)  Chef and manager should be fired.. Avoid this location, go to dundas instead...  They got rid of the potatoe soup and vinegerette salad dressing.. What a bunch of clowns"}
{"text":"Stopped by Red Lobster for a late lunch.  We found the place with just a few customers. I ordered the Sailors Platter containing Grouper, Garlic Shrimp, Fried Shrimp, baby brussel sprouts and coleslaw.  My meal was absolutely delicious, the service was fast and server was very pleasant. I will return very soon for lunch."}
{"text":"So yummy I love this place. Such good customer service and the food is great. Decent prices and get atmosphere"}
{"text":"Party of two ..... Was welcomed by the greater and shown to a table... We waited for about 15 minutes to be served, finally had enough and had no choice other than to get up and leave.  It wasn't so busy, it just seems the help in more and more inexperienced."}
{"text":"Like most chain restaurants it is always just so so. Staff is always friendly but it doesn't make up for the food which is always either bad or mediocre at best. The only reason I go is because my wife likes it and let's face it, those biscuits are AMAZING!"}
{"text":"Was here Feb 25-2016, must say we were not satisfied with it at all. I don't know if they realize how down hill the food has become. Their was 5 of us. We all had different things so we can't say it was just one dish... The only thing that I seemed to enjoy was the biscuit and the strawberry daiquiri I had.   The only good thing about this experience is the timing that it took for us to get a seat. They were relatively busy and we only had to wait 10 mins."}
{"text":"My partner loves Red Lobster, but is just OK for me.  He is from WA. state, so he knows excellent seafood...but still likes this Neighborhood feeling...so, we went last weekend, because it is close to home.  HALIBUT was my highlight!  I absolutely adore Halibut and it is not frequently offered by most restaurants, let alone a national chain!  Imagine my JOY! It was delicious!  They prepared just as I requested.  Caesar salad was good as always (little to no vinegar) Cheesy biscuits delicious as ever.  Green beans a bit undercooked, broccoli a bit over cooked.  I normally do not rate RL very high...but the HALIBUT bumped this night up a notch and hope it is on menu when we go next.  BTW....shouldn't there be a rule against beards worn by food & drink servers? Women must tie back their hair...what about beards above your food?  Bartender here sports a beard."}
{"text":"I had to spend dinner with a large loud group. I ask the lady that was hosting if I can sit somewhere else she said no because they had just clean and because the staff was short. But that's funny because I saw 3 girls at the front door talking and laughing doing everything but working. I would give my waiter 5 stars, he did a great job.  This occur last night"}
{"text":"We went here as a party of 8 and our server James did a great job! Was on top of things, he did also bring us an extra salad and when he noticed he brought us the wrong drink he let us have the one he brought for free. Great people skills and was great with timing with it being a Saturday night!  Definitely would come back!"}
{"text":"We got there early and the there was like no one there so it was good, the hostess still though put us on hold to make sure there was a clean table....  The server at first was VERY attentive but as the night went on she became more forgetful. I am still waiting for my salad dressing.....  The food was ok, the shrimp was over cooked.  All in all it was ok."}
{"text":"The hubs and I had a gift card and finally got to use it on a date night. It was my first time eating seafood since I was pregnant and I was excited. The food was decent. We split an entree. Our grilled shrimp were cold and the waitress was very quick to get us new, very warm shrimp to replace the cold ones. It wasn't a terrible dining experience, but it definitely wasn't the best. The cheddar biscuits shouldn't be the best thing you eat there."}
{"text":"This place is terrible!!  Eat at your own risk. Spent $65 for a very early dinner/lunch on a Sunday.  We had one appetizer to share, one NY Strip steak dinner, one wood grilled Lobster, Shrimp and Scallops dinner, one cup of coffee and one water.  The steak tasted like it was warmed up from the night before. The seafood smelled and tasted very old - strong fish smell and again tasted like it was warmed up.  We would not recommend this place to anyone.  What a waste of money!  We are home not feeling very well right now."}
{"text":"The food was excellent.   The service was very good as well.   The only reason I gave them 3 or of 5 stars is because of the wait for a table.   The restaurant was only half full and we waited for over an hour to be seated.   There is no excuse for this."}
{"text":"Came here about a week ago and the service was SUPER slow. Took over an hour for food to come out. Ended up getting it boxed up because we for full from bed. Against our better judgement we came back again to celebrate my moms birthday. Service equally as slow again tonight. Learned they only have one person in the kitchen. Not sure what's going on here but definitely won't be back to this red lobster again."}
{"text":"Had a nice Anniversary dinner with my husband.  The wait wasn't long...  the host that sat us was nice... also had a very nice && good server Ellen B.  Will definitely return to eat here at this Red Lobster location."}
{"text":"The waiting time was reasonable for a Friday night it was less than 20 min  The table was excellent as I had 2 children with me the waiter was sop nice she made up our day   The food was as usually testy and delicious with good portion the coconut shrimp as starter was ok then the lobster bisque  I had the lobster shrimp &scallops   We end the party with apple crostacia    Note the restroom was not clean  The bill was brought with out request"}
{"text":"My family and I first visit to this establishment. New Year's Day not many customers was greeted well, our server \"Gloria\" was great as well as the food. The only problem was we ordered an appetizer and they forgot about it till we were almost done with our lunch. Two people tried to leave it on our table and we said NO IT'S TO LATE. The manager came by to apologize and ask if we needed anything else, I said \"yes more tarter sauce please\" never got it. HMMM"}
{"text":"Our family goes to red lobster every month and last week's bar harbour bake was very disappointing. For $32.00, instead of 3 full sized scallops, they now replaced it with about a dozen puny little ones that you can buy for a dollar a pack at any grocery.  The size of their shrimps have also reduced to smaller than medium. The amount of pasta has also gone down, making this dish entirely not worth the money. I don't care about your cheap mussels."}
{"text":"Don't ever go to this Red Lobster. Not only is the service terrible, the management is terrible. I just had the worst experience ever. Poor Red Lobster, this used to be my favorite restaurant, but i will never eat there again. It was that bad."}
{"text":"New years eve early dinner. We got to the restaurant at 4:30. The parking lot was full there were many empty tables but we were told it would be a 15 minute wait. I realized they had tables but no servers yet. Weird you would think they would be prepared for the big night ahead. Maybe the waiters were scheduled for 5. I'll give them a break. We only waited 4 minutes. Our waiter came and took our drink order and casually asked if we wanted \" an appetizer\". I was surprised he didn't try to up sell or offer something that sounded yummy. We quickly ordered. On special was split crab leg dinner for $24.99. I placed my order and he comes back 5 min later saying they are out of that special and I can have the king crab for $30. How the hell are you out of the special on new years....defintely one of the busiest days of the year. I am baffled. Get it together."}
{"text":"We went here for our anniversary tonight . I havent ate a red lobster for 10 years because of how gross it was! But we decided it was time again after reentering the real world ( we justed moved back from the bush alaska) . And to tell you it wasnt bad at all. I really enjoyed my dinner and service! And my alcoholic drink actually had alcohol in it"}
{"text":"Awesome experience to say the least. Our server Dominique was probably the best server I've had in awhile. We were a party of 6 who all brought on the all you can eat shrimp. I have to say, he brought his A game with a smile because we asked for a lot of things throughout the stay and he never forgot anything. Waters and beverages were always filled and always had shrimp at the table. Attentive, friendly and fast.  Furthermore, I know it's an old establishment so I expected the bathrooms to be musky and somewhat dirty. Not here, the bathrooms were completely clean and didn't smell bad. A+ to the ones that clean the restrooms. I always say clean bathroom equals clean kitchen.   I'll for sure return, thanks guys!"}
{"text":"My dad kept asking to go here so I took him for his birthday. I'll admit I'm not a fan of most major chain restaurants(rather support places where the food is made with love). I got the ultimate seafood platter to get the full experience but wish I hadn't."}
{"text":"Had the best dinner and the waitress was at the top of their game.The food was hot and very good.Would recommend you come by before 5:00 gets very crowded and busy."}
{"text":"Red Lobster at Decatur and US 95. My whole family ate there for fathers day. Its our 3rd time. Each time is same star. Dont know why we keep coming back. Yesterday the lobster and shrimps dry chewy no taste except salty, side salad was ok not crisp enough for my standard of fresh greens, pasta shrimp alfredo was the only one we really like but as it gets cooler you can see all grease at the base of plate.I also had shrimp bruschetta which was super salty, shrimp has no flavor at all. I love the dinner rolls. Its soft warm very tasty. I had warm choco cake w/ vanilla ice cream, cake was super moist delicious , ice cream no flavor. Service was good. We dont plan to eat in that place again for a long time anyway!"}
{"text":"Great local and friendly staff, not to mention the food is delicious and their menu extensive with quality dishes to satisfy any appetite. Needless to say, we shall return without a doubt."}
{"text":"Went to Red Lobster,the receptionist said that it would be about 25 mins it was around 45 min.After being seated it took your server 10 mins to take our order .We waited a hour and 15mins before we could get a food .The glass was cracked after waiting for almost two hour l lost my appetite. The service was terrible."}
{"text":"Their lobster tacos are delicious  and the staff is very friendly. The restaurant is clean and smells good. I enjoy coming to dinner."}
{"text":"Here's the thing, I went on a Wednesday afternoon so I won't comment on service because it was fine.  However, I will comment on food. One of our party order an alfredo dish and it had clearly been reheated quickly (probably in a microwave). How do we know this? Well, when reheated improperly/quickly, these dishes separate and oil was in puddles around concealed alfredo. VERY disappointing.  The clam chowder was meh. Briny and scant on clams. Truthfully, I can get the same thing out of a can of Campbells."}
{"text":"Low expectations met.  Had to spend the gift card, so we reluctantly came here.  The Mahi was surprisingly good.   Not great, but good.  The rest of the family was leaning towards being disappointed by their meals. Side requested was grilled mixed vegetables.  Meager and lame!  Come on! How do you screw up vegetables. Spoke to manager who ended up comping the meal, admitting their vegetable sides suck. I asked him why not fix that? Said he'd bring the complaint to his higher ups. That good attitude and the good mahi earned 3 stars. Would have been less otherwise."}
{"text":"We have been a Red Lobster & his corporation patronage for many years. My rant is We been  Waiting to be seated for little over 30 min...which is not a problem but when 2 diffrent party walk in after us and got seated first and the manager said there is nothing wrong with the computer?Wow, seriously? Not acceptable, i am Very, Very, Very disappointed. Thank God, We didn't have to wait long to be seated at Claim Jumper."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I decided to go to spend a gift card someone gave us and while we love seafood, this place definitely doesn't warrant more than 3 stars. We both ordered main entrees but was sorely disappointed. The salad that came out first was all white lettuce and no good greens. The crab legs came out late not with my food order, rice was undercooked with no flavor, the broccoli side was not cooked thoroughly either. The wait time for our meal was average and our wait time to sit was about 20 minutes on a Tuesday night which seems semi-average.  The waiter was friendly and observant and the lobster/crab meat was good."}
{"text":"There are reasons why we only go to Red Lobster about once every ten years, we just forgot them this evening.  My wife was hungry for trout so we went to Red Lobster.  She ordered the trout.  After waiting to the point of frustration for our food to be served, our server came out and said the chef had just told her that they were out of trout.  Would my wife like another fish?  She settled on cod.  Our meals finally came.  She couldn't eat the cod which she described as tough.  Server was apologetic and offered tilapia.  When the tilapia came it was at least two servings.  By now my wife was just upset and wasn't in the mood for anything.  We weren't charged for her meal (she only ate the salad).  So, it will probably be another ten years before we try a Red Lobster again."}
{"text":"Had to go down to 2 stars sorry not sorry. Honestly going to this place is a gamble. You will either have excellent service or complete crap! Your waiter will either literally argue with you about what you ordered or give you good service. Not worth the gamble anymore In my opinion. Same goes for the food sometimes it's fresh and delicious or it tastes like it's been sitting out for an hour and you got a plate someone else no longer wanted an hour ago. I've been here a handful of times I'm just gonna try another seafood place it's ridiculous at this point."}
{"text":"This review is purely for the service. Red Lobster food is Red Lobster food, and you're going to get subpar seafood pretty much no matter what. You're in the midwest...what do you expect?   The service here is fantastic. My salad had something funky going on with the lettuce, and the waitress handled the situation beautifully. She apologized, and promptly offered me a new salad, and went to get the manager. I declined the salad (eh.), but the manager was very sweet, and took my meal off the bill. Additionally, my boyfriend wanted dessert, and they paid for that too! Despite the fact that it was a small mistake and not their fault, they dealt with the situation by putting the customer first. We will be back because of that great response...and maybe the cheddar bay biscuits."}
{"text":"I really like their coconut shrimps & baked biscuits. Grilled fish & steamed lobsters are good too.   I would pass on soup & salad.  Comfy interior. Nice servers. Good for family gatherings.  But i wouldn't go out of my way to come here."}
{"text":"Well, nothing to say about the waiting time (20-25min.) besides that there is something worse, the waitress............. named Terry, OMG, the Terry lady came to check on my husband and I about 2 times the whole hour we were there, once was time to leave we asked for a to-go box, since we were watching our neighbor's waitress how great customer service she provided, this waitress not only was checking on them every so often, she brought the box, paper bag to them and she placed the food in the box, it was delightful to se how great their service was, ours, in the other hand, HORRIBLE, this lady brought the box, dumped on the table and kept on going, (no paper bag at all)once my husband finished his dinner we asked for another box. I loved this one, my husband placed the plate on the edge of the table, in front of him, this time we asked for a box and PAPER BAG, we figured that was the only way   were going to get one. Don't have the lady bringing the box and the bag, then she pushes the plate to make some room to put the bill !!!! (she never got the message) Well, we left with a bad taste and not because of their food, this Terry lady just  spoiled our night."}
{"text":"I love Red Lobster. There I said it. This one is roomy with big comfy booths and apparent they have expanded the menu to include shrimp tacos (which I ordered with broccoli on the side). It's well priced. Some of the items (like the potato and bacon soup I started with) are on the salty side. But you can't beat those cheesy biscuits they bring to the table that go right to my hips. The staff is super friendly and it's close to other restaurants that are small and crowded compared to this one. Recommend it."}
{"text":"Endless shrimp is freaking bomb. Adam (server) was fun"}
{"text":"Excellent food however the service we received was horrible. I went to this Red Lobster location with a large group of people (6) and we were told we would have to wait 30-45 minutes for a table. We agreed and watched as they cleaned off large tables, separated them and proceeded to sit smaller parties that had arrived after we did. Then a large party of 6 that arrived 20 minutes after us was seated before us. After waiting over 90 minutes and being seated we asked to speak to the manager. He did not apologize, just offered to give us free appies when we tried to ask why we were shoved aside he didn't want to give an explanation other then \"These things happen\". Well this location has lost my patronage and I will only go to the location in the NE from now on."}
{"text":"Service was fantastic. Drinks were nice and strong.. But everything about the food was just not that great. Very bland tasting everything from start to finish. Make sure you drink heavy and stick to fried foods because if youre big on seafood you may be in for disappointment. 2 star review"}
{"text":"Very convenient off of 80. Stayed at the Red Roof Inn with our dog on our way home to Milwaukee from a visit to NJ - about a half way point.  Take out specialist for our phone in dinner order was super friendly and our order was ready on time, perfectly packed and delicious.  I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"GIVE THEM ALLLLL THE STARS !!!  ( OR AT LEAST THE KING !!! )  we had this suppppppeeeeeer sweet waiter, his name was david king and hes made every visit super enjoyable, customer service is stellar ! right off the bat when we came in we were taken care of and I just couldn't believe it ! I highly recommend this restaurant ! the manager or assistant manager was really nice to us too !   the only thing is the windows were a tad sticky but that's really nothing ! lol"}
{"text":"One of my coworkers tried to convince me that this Red Lobster is in a different league than all the other Red Lobsters, and that this one is \"actually nice!\".  So when my husband suggested that late last night (9:30 pm on the Thursday of Easter Weekend) I was willing to go.... but begrudgingly, because I really wanted to go somewhere fun downtown.  Anyway, Red Lobster it was, and Red Lobster it will never ever be again.   First, they told us it would be a 10 minute wait, which was fine.... until we realized that the place was full of empty tables!?  My only guess is that maybe they were short staffed, and trying to stagger the crowd a bit.  But it seemed very odd.    We both ordered fish & chips, figuring you can't really go wrong.  It comes with a salad - we both opted for Caesar.  I couldn't get over how obscurely perfect the shredded cheese on top was; it obviously comes out of a package and probably never expires.  The whole salad was also so heavily dressed that I didn't finish it - which is saying a lot coming from a girl who likes a LOT of dressing on a salad.  When the fish & chips arrived, I kept getting whiffs of soap, and I still haven't figured that out.  But I definitely wasn't smelling fish, and when I did smell fish, it just didn't seem appetizing.  There were two pieces of very soggy, limp fish, sitting on top of a medium-sized arrangement of fries that didn't seem memorable at all.  There was also a side of coleslaw that looked so wet and tired that I didn't even touch it.  In fact, I didn't touch much of anything, and couldn't wait to just get home.  I   There wasn't so much something wrong with the experience, but there was just nothing right about it either."}
{"text":"Love how fresh is everything and the roles are delivered worm to the table never a bad experience I highly recommend it"}
{"text":"Went on Friday after seeing endless commercials .. Obviously my expectations were too high.   Poor management, the place was dirty , there was no apparent team work within the staff, the food was so high in sodium, the server was fine but the food took almost an hr wait .. It wasn't that busy when we went... So really... There is so excuse.   Will not return. Especially not to this location."}
{"text":"I would agree with some of the prior reviews about this being a 3.5 star place. My family comes to this location regularly. The food is always the same in quality and flavor which I appreciate.   I usually order the popcorn shrimp, baked potato, and a side Cesar salad. I have no complaints with anything I order.   The true reason I keep coming back is the biscuits. They are amazing and I could likely eat a dozen and not feel bad one bit."}
{"text":"Prices have increased and quite a bit even when they have specials going on like the lobster fest. Good food but I wish it wasn't that expensive ."}
{"text":"I found the food good but the prices for what you get was higher than i expected.  Service was great..."}
{"text":"I was so looking forward to lunch. I have not lived in a city with a Red Lobster  in years. The waitress was great. Top notched. Seated rights way. Refills on soda without asking etc.  We started with the biscuts. A little under cooked, but very tasty. After all that's what butter and chesse are for, right? The ceaser salad was chopped up nice, no big leaves to have to cut up, just the right amoumt of fixings for my taste. We are good so far. Next we ordered a combo for lunch, fried srimp and fried scallops with fries. I didn't expect it to be really pretty, after all it is fried food, but there was no attempt by the chef to even begin to make me want to take that first bit. Thrown on a plate with no garnish, no lemon wedge. It was a small serving, and the garnish would have at least made it look like I was getting more too. Ok, so I was there to eat. I could over look the presentation. The fish was so dried out and I can't remember having such limpy fries. I was going off my good eating habits for THIS? I can't tell you how disappointed I was. Maybe the dinners with broiled seafood are better. But a last I will never go back to find out. I will stick to going to AJ's for my fish and cook it at home. When I go to a restaurent I expect something at least equal to what I can do at home with minimal effort.  So if you decide to try it, you have to be willing to pay the price and try the broiled dinners. Skip the fries though."}
{"text":"Sarah was over lunchtime server and she was awesome! The Red Lobster bisque was nice and creamy. I also had steak and shrimp with grilled zucchini and rice pilaf which was tasty. Biscuits were fresh and hot. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"No wifi!!! This an outrage! The food is good though. This is a good location to celebrate occasions like birthdays and anniversaries."}
{"text":"Horrendously Slow Service!  Expect to be there for twice as long as any normal restaurant. I'm not sure if this is indicative of all Red Lobsters, but this one had obnoxiously slow service. This would be acceptable if they actually checked on you more than once a visit. From the time we sat down until we saw wait staff, it took over 20 minutes just to order drinks. Luckily the hostess gave us menus so we could rush the food order at the same time. We were afraid it would be another 20 minutes for the girl to come back. The waitress then asked us if we were there to celebrate something. I don't know why, but that made us feel like she didn't think we were good enough to eat there unless it was a special occasion.   However, little did we know it would take another 20 minutes just to see our waitress again when she brought salads. It took 30 minutes more just to see our food. The three of us ordered fried shrimp with a baked potato, shrimp scampi with a baked potato and salmon with \"fresh broccoli\". The fried shrimp was nicely breaded, the scampi was over cooked, the salmon tasted like its been in a refrigerator for a while and the fresh broccoli was completely dry and cold. The waitress only came by once for refills before trying to clear the table and bringing the check.   Lastly, when did Red Lobster get to be so expensive? I would highly suggest going to pretty much any other seafood place for the cost. Just based on matching the price, you'll get a much better meal and how much higher quality of food. I feel like they are trying to be fine dining when they are an average at best restaurant.   The biscuits were good though, if you could order just those to-go through a drive through or something they'd make a killing."}
{"text":"A lot of good and a great deal of mediocre here. My son only wants the biscuits. I love the skewered shrimp and clam strips myself. My only complaint is that they have stared dicing the tomatoes and cucumbers in the house salad. I can only say, \" please go back to thin slices they are so much easier to eat than tiny little chunks.\""}
{"text":".My family has eaten at the Cactus Rd. Red Lobster periodically for over 15 years. Mostly the food has been good. Two weeks ago we attempted to have lunch a little after 12:40PM. The couple in front of us was seated immediately but we were told it would be a ten minute. When I inquired as to why the wait,  hostess lied, and said that there were no tables or booths that were ready. This was interesting as I could see two booths that were obviously ready. This is clearly a management decision to not utilize part of the dining room as they do not want to fully staff even during the busiest lunch hour. Forcing the hostess to lie to customers is deplorable. Years ago I ran into this same thing at the neighboring Olive Garden. I stopped eating at that location just as I have now stopped eating at this particular Red Lobster. Restaurants are a service business and there is no reason to eat at a place that does something like this."}
{"text":"As soon as we arrived Jesus was out server. He has a great sense of humor and was very polite and profesional. We had a wonderful meal and great company. All you can eat shrill and The Ultimate Feast were to die for!  Jesus is the best in the business and he is the reason we will be returning.  Thank you Jesus and the chefs!"}
{"text":"Super super good!  Now this is what you called GOOD and consistent seafood. I would pay the 33.99 for the two lobster tails again and again. Food even tasted good one day after. I enjoyed it to every last piece :).    They sing you happy bday if requested and the staff are friendly,helpful, and welcoming. Food was cooked to perfection.  I would go again just for the amazing food and experience.   Great and big drinks too! Huge margaritas and Daiquiris- Taste amazing, whether you order a non-virgin or a virgin drink.   Everything was good. Lobster Bisque soup, Salad(I had blue cheese), Stuffed Mushrooms, Grilled shrimp, coconut shrimp( you can actually taste the coconut on it!)  We had Surf and Turf, Lobster Lovers Dreams, Lobster stuffed Baked Potato, all served with a smile. We all raved about it.  And it all came fast, and hot.   Very friendly staff and chief/cook :)  Highly reccomend if you want good seafood, forget those cheap, mass produced buffets and spend the money on some quality seafood- you won't regret it."}
{"text":"My first time at this location. Good average service, friendly staff.....the food was great!"}
{"text":"Blech.  I'm always skeptical of a seafood place that has an overwhelming fishy smell as it tells me the seafood isn't that fresh.  Red Lobster has that smell."}
{"text":"We drove from Broadview Heights and ordered the  Crab Lovers Dream for $27 because it looks so good  in the commercials and their website make sure to look at it if you order to go which I did and what they sent looks nothing like the ad in fact I have never see skinnier snow crab in my life! By the time you crack them open its not even worth the effort! Oh and by the way they didn't even send the linguini!!! For a seafood restaurant I'll just drive to Independence and go to Bonefish Grill which is very good and consistent."}
{"text":"We are regulars of Red Lobster but after today's experience we will never go back. We went on a Monday around 3pm so it was fairly empty but the service was extra slow and the visits by our server were few and far between. The food was brought out cold and undercooked and when we let our server know she seemed bothered by us. The manager did come out and made sure warm food was brought out which was great,  but it didn't make up for the awful experience. I'm sad to say we will not be going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Went here twice during the Stampede. First time they ran out of glasses for the Lobster Rita. Had it in a tall glass & it melted too fast. Didn't see people with the large glass around me. Dishwasher too slow? Next time ordered the artichoke lobster dip again but this time the chips weren't the regular corn chips but greasy pita chips. Server didn't come around to check how we liked the appetizer until we were almost finished. I asked why the chips were different & she said they ran out of their regular chips. The manager could have gone to the grocery store to get more. The seafood was awesome as usual! We will definitely go back but if anything is changed from the menu I will send it back!"}
{"text":"Went to try the all you can eat shrimp. No hassle had shrimp scampi, Mediterranean shrimp, shrimp in garlic butter and Ceasars salad. I ate 8 servings of the shrimp. All were hot and replenished quickly, no problem with the trying to fill you up with bread etc. I was treated friendly and courteously. Will be back soon."}
{"text":"Excellent seafood, not greasy, & light coating if you are ordering fried. This is probably my favorite seafood spot! Parking is extremely convenient . red  lobster is a awesome  place-   They also sell special order MASSIVE lobsters. Awesome place. I highly recommend, and its in a beautiful area to take a nice stroll or grab a couple beers after you eat. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"We went on a Tuesday at about 7:00pm and were seated right away.  Our service was excellent -- water glasses remained filled, the waiter stopped by often to check on things, salad and dinner dishes were removed promptly, etc.  Our orders included salmon baked on a cedar plank, a whole lobster and one of the lobster fest specials. The food was well prepared and presented.  I am not a fan of chain restaurants, but there are not a whole lot of places in this neck of the desert that serve lobsters."}
{"text":"I went there with my family, the service was so bad, I asked for water and we waited for so long there's no water for us at all...also after we finish the salad they gave us salad sauce, they didn't give us fork and stuff too..."}
{"text":"The food was good but Rene, our waitress, was absolutely horrible. She seemed like she didn't wanna be there, she would cop an attitude every time we asked her for something and when she would bring something to the table, she would throw it down on the table like she was angry with us. Even though the appetizers and entrees were great, she ruined the experience for us. As a matter of fact, the table next to us had a different server. They got their drinks, appetizers and entrees before we even got our biscuits and we arrived before them. I will surely insist on sitting in a different area if I ever go back to Red Lobster again...and that's a big IF"}
{"text":"The shrimp is raw tonight. Omg This is the worst Red Lobster We arrived at 8pm and now its 9:50 we have had to wait for refills 15-20mins. The manager has been here to argue with us. We told him how much more efficient other red lobster are compare to this one.  Save yourself the stress and hassle don't come to this location. Its run by a gang of incompetent monkeys!!!"}
{"text":"We took our grandmother here for a going away dinner before she moved to a different city, sadly it was not what we came to expect from red lobster.  The air conditioner was cranked to the max and it was a chilly day to begin with , so when our food finally arrived it was cold before we got to taste it. We had ordered endless shrimp and after our first round of shrimp we waited for our waiter to return for over 15 minutes , and after we ordered the second shrimp selection they didn't make it to our table for another 20 minutes and after the rest of us had finished our entire meals .  We then asked for the bill and when we finally got it the waiter didn't return to cash us out. We actually had to walk to the front to pay .  We asked the manager to speak about our service and he told us to wait a moment and he would be right back , but never returned .  Service at its finest .... lol"}
{"text":"I'm not big on chain restaurants.  Not because the food is bad but because I like to try new places.  I've been going to Red Lobster for years with family and this was by far the worst service I've ever had.  I think the waitress may have been new so I try to give her a little break.  We went here because I was given a gift card.  The food was good as normal but it took about 15-20 min to get some of their famous buscuits.  She also took forever to bring my GF a fork so she could eat.  The shrimp was a bit over cooked but it prob just sat under the heat lamp forever because the waitress was so slow.    Overall it's still Red Lobster, it's good but the service that day was not very good."}
{"text":"Poor service...watched patrons seated well after us get here food 15 Min before us."}
{"text":"Service is always good here. The wait is never long. Food is good. I don't think it's the best seafood, def can find it better.. But for a lot more expensive of course."}
{"text":"My family loves Red Lobster!  Since I have introduced my son to lobster, he just can't get enough.  Whenever they have a special going, we are always there.  It is just too good to pass up."}
{"text":"Disappointing at best. Server was good however you could tell they were short staff. 20 minutes to get a salad. Fish was cold and not much better than the frozen stuff from giant eagle. Attempted to speak to the manager but was to busy to help us. Place looked like it had not been cleaned in months. Stay away."}
{"text":"Waited 30 mins. for a table, there w ere many cleaned empties. Floor manager said not enough servers were scheduled. Very poorly managed. We left (party of four). Was not kept informed as to when we would be seated, lobby was empty. Will not return."}
{"text":"Took the family to this particular Red Lobster for my oldest son's birthday (he wanted Red Lobster).  We usually go to the S. Alma School location, but decided to try this one.  Big mistake!  We entered and the hostess was not very friendly, and was rolling her eyes about something when we greeted her.  We waited the 15-20 mins to be seated, no biggy.  We get seated and the waitress comes by for our drink order.  We get drinks and take a few to decide our order, and this is when the fun started.  The waitress never mentions specials, etc so as we order I ask for a particular item that she states is popular and that is why they're out of it.  I make a choice on something else, but this could have been avoided by a simple explanation of specials and a \"by the way, we are out of this\"  So we get our slads and biscuits and it seemed to be ok.  Now our order arrives, me and my sons get our orders, my wife gets a portion of what is supposed to be served as an entree in appetizer form.  The waitress explains here are these shrimps, the grilled take longer, it's my fault but it should be up in 2 minutes.  Ok, 10 minutes later, the grilled shrmp skewer is brought out, no sides that are supposed to be with them.  The waitress asks did you want me to bring those out?  Really?  With a little bit of an attitude I might add.  My wife then asks to speak to  a manager.  He comes over about 5-7 minutes later, which makes me think he may have over camplaints.  He was very nice and comped her meal and my son's dessert.  The 2 stars are for him making her order right,  It will be a long time, if ever we go back there due to some piss poor attitudes by people that should be working in a toll booth rather than dealing in the service industry."}
{"text":"I'm going to have to say no.  The waitress was great, too bad the food wasn't.  I ordered the lobster, shrimp and crab legs, potato and rice.  I was hungry :-)  The restaurant was about 3/4 full and it only took a few minutes to get food.  When it did come it was cold, yuck and everything was drenched in butter and salt.  My tongue still hurts due to the volume of salt.  The lobster tail was as rubbery as a burned steak. I probably shouldn't have eaten it.  I remember Red Lobster used to be good for sea food.  This is no longer the case."}
{"text":"Had the worst customer service ever. If your server is Tammy, you're in for a surprise...rude, cranky and gives you dirty looks. She clearly doesn't like her job!!!"}
{"text":"Went there for their all you can eat shrimp promotion.  Glad we made a reservation, as they were packed at 6:30 p.m. on Sat.  We were seated promptly.  Waitress was great.  When she delivered one order of shrimp to all, she took order for the next round as they are made fresh.  Cheesey biscuits are delish.  You get a smaller portion of smaller shrimp each time, but that's fine.  Get a good variety of recipes, garlic scampi, coconut, fried and alfredo.  Last year they had sriracha which were good too.  Good sides too, I had fresh green beans.  Even though it was busy, waitresses handled all of her tables well."}
{"text":"Got food poisoning from eating baked stuffed sole from this location in 2005. Threw up for a week and lost 5 pounds. Haven't been back to a Red Lobster since."}
{"text":"My husband and I took our children there to celebrate their birthdays on June 24th....The service and food were ok. .the wait time was terrible! Our bill for 4 people totaled $110 which is understandable. ..however, when we received our credit card statement, we were charged $210.00!!!!!! Upon calling the restaurant and visiting the restaurant for a resolution, the manager showed my husband a receipt on his phone and stated they're going to have to get a hand writing analysis in order to validate if we actually wrote a $100 tip or not, and it would take several weeks for a resolution because paying us back what they STOLE is going to be a loss for their restaurant. We should have known something like this was a possibility because the restaurant has a deputy on duty as well as cameras upon entering, which is quite unusual, but if STEALING tips is the norm, then I can see the need for the deputy at the door!"}
{"text":"Our experience at this location was wonderful and the service was great. The food was prepared well and seasoned nicely. We're definitely coming back for more lobster and snow crab!!!! Overall a great experience."}
{"text":"Average food average service nothing special here just the run of the mill chain restrant but the muffins are to die for......"}
{"text":"Excellent sea food. We ordered popcorn shrimp, coconut shrimp, sweet and sour chili shrimp and i could not remember one more dish which is shrimp too. Everything is delicious and my shrimp cravings are satisfied."}
{"text":"food and service at this location was great! ordered a dozen of oysters and they were extremely fresh!"}
{"text":"Let me atart by saying that this is my first review on yelp and i just had to do it!  First of all and most importantly my server JESUS is the best server ever! And the reason why iam writting this. Thank you jesus, you are the best!  Food was really good and on time.  Would i go back? Of course as long as jesus is still working there :)"}
{"text":"This particular Red Lobster holds a special place in my heart, as we've celebrated many special occasions here as a family. Of late however, it seems that the service has gone down hill. Unfriendly hostesses, a little too pushy servers, too high of prices for what you get, and decor desperately needs an update. We will continue to dine at RL, but probably at a different location from now on."}
{"text":"I enjoy coming here, especially for special occasions. The food is great and the servers are nice. My favorite dish is lobster pizza. I've had lobster pizza here multiple times and it's consistently good every single time and I would come back just for the pizza. I also like their bread. Very generous refills of the bread!"}
{"text":"Shelly is amazing bartender & server. Every time I've come for lunch, she gives over-the-top service. She usually sees me at the bar top during all-you-can-eat shrimp promotion. She's an assist to Red Lobster, & the reason why I keep coming back."}
{"text":"Service is good but food and environment is not good. Restaurant is not the cleanest. Won't go back and don't compare to other Red Lobsters."}
{"text":"Had Red Lobster tonight for dinner. Not such a good idea! I got the Rock Lobster tail that came to me partially raw (the entire bottom of the tail). I sent it back. When I received the new one it was so overcooked and rubbery that I could have bounced it off of the floor and then it would have landed back on my plate. Staff was very nice about it and was kind enough to remove it from our check. Probably a good thing since I wasn't going to pay for it anyway."}
{"text":"The food here is ok and I think the best is steam fresh lobster.  Occasionally I came for fish of the day.  Also they offer lobster or crab fest from season to season but I wouldn't recommend those. It'd be better to stick with grilled fish and fresh lobster.  The portion is quite filling and entree comes with 2 sides and salad.  The baked biscuit is yummy and tasty.  Service wise is not bad but varies from server to server.  I also like the ambiance and decor here as the ambiance is quite warm and comfy.  It's also one of the very few restaurants I had had when I first arrived in Canada, so it holds a special spot as well."}
{"text":"Who doesn't love Red Blobster?!  I will say I usually try to go to local businesses, especially since there are so many amazing local restaurants in PGH, but sometimes you just want some greasy, butter-soaked chain food. Am I right?  This Red Lobster hit the spot and I made sure to eat an entire basket of cheesy biscuits.   Best time to go though: definitely during all you can eat shrimps season!"}
{"text":"4 of us went here for dinner on Saturday evening n we sat at the bar which seats maybe 20. If that. And it was not busy(the bar). We ordered oysters n they were the worst. Warm. Ugh. Then salads came all but mine. Cabresie. Everyone was done when mine came. I asked one of the bartenders (Ron) if they still had biscuits, he says, OF COURSE WE DO! (in a snippy voice) I said, do you think we could get some, n in a nasty tone he says, WELL I DID NOT TAKE YOUR ORDER! I said, N you can't get us biscuits? He storms away. He was the RUDEST person I've ever met at any Red Lobster. We are totally dissatisfied with the mean n the service. It probably would of been a better meal had he been a little nicer. There are a million places to eat with nicer people!"}
{"text":"Not the usual place one thinks of for a celebratory dinner, but i have friend with weird tastes. We went here last night, my friend had been craving Red Lobster for 6months, and the celebrating of a new job seemed like a good enough reason to go. Had we not been in a good mood, and extremely chatty, i feel that we would have noticed that it took 50mins for our food to arrive, as well as one order being wrong. I'm not scatherin the place, as you have to know what to expect with chain seafood places, and so i wasnt to bothered. But what i do expect from somewhere like Red Lobster is impeccable services, and that is what we received. Even though a food was late and little not what we ordered, our server was amazing, and comped almost a quarter of the mealwith free chocolate cake. A mediocre place can be salvaged by thing like this.    So on the basis of this, i would like to give red lobster 3 stars, but I'm afraid it can only get 2 at this time"}
{"text":"Food was bland an not authentic seafood, its not fresh, although their drinks are good place location isnt very nice, the aroma of the place is nice looking just wasnt really food appealing. Cost wise is normal for me."}
{"text":"After 2 visits to this restaurant, I am left disappointed. The staff and particularly the manager are generally rude. Even with call ahead seating, it is not always honored. And if you point out any small mistakes, the staff is rude and unaccomodating. I've never been treated so bad by a \"manager\" that supposedly is all about customer service. I don't know why he is still in charge of such a busy location. I would stay away....."}
{"text":"I tried this place many years ago and said I would not be coming back. Yes it is a chain and usually chain places are not great but they're also not horrible. I tried it again recently since the hubby had never been there. We've just decided that we are never going back. everything was drenched in butter. Why did it take 45 minutes for our food to get there? I was so thirsty by the end of the evening because everything was so salty. Even the cooks messed up the steak order at the table next to us. This must be their way of making money on drinks. Save yourself the trip, if you're paying this much for mediocre seafood, might as well try a nicer place downtown."}
{"text":"We recently had dinner at this Red Lobster location before going to the theatre. To be honest, this was our backup choice, since the kids wanted to go to The Pickle Barrel, but the wait was too long. I had not been to a Red Lobster in many years, and all I remembered was shrimp and seafood drenched in butter... not great. However, there are now some pretty decent healthier choices on the menu, and we found the food to be very good. The kids also enjoyed their selections.  What really surprised me however, was the excellent service.  When we told them we had limited time because we had to get to the theatre, we were seated almost immediately. The manager came to see us to assure us that we would be OK to make it on time. Our waiter was very friendly and efficient. Our food came quickly, but without feeling like we were rushed... a fine balance. We would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Food was good but not great, while The service there was fantastic.  We tried the 18.99 usd - unlimited shrimp. There were five different cook styles. The Grill one was the best. Lots of protein!  If you can not finish the shrimp in your plate, the server would give you a to-go box."}
{"text":"We went to Red Lobster on Valentine's Day. We called for reservations and were told they weren't taking them for that day. We got there before 5:00 to beat the crowd. There were people lined up everywhere. When we went to the desk she informed us they had call ahead waiting!!  I wish she had told me that when I called for reservations!  We had an hour and fifteen min wait..no problem...we did a little shopping next door!  We did have a lovely dinner!!  For as busy as they were the service and food were great!  The lobster was delicious!!"}
{"text":"Great food and amazing service! Thank you to Natasha for some amazing service. Myself, my husband and my kids had a great dinner last night. Natasha was on top of everything! We will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"Dooooo NOT come to this location. Disgusting! I had hair in my salad and when I to my waitress, she commented \" im so sorry, i swear I checked it this time\" as though this is common. Are the cooks not required to wear hair nets? And why would the waitress have to check the food for hair?  She didn't even report it to the manager. Please beware of this location."}
{"text":"I just came back from the Endless Shrimp promotion. I was with my wife and 4 friends so we had to wait a while for a table. The food was very good throughout the night. I am writing this review though, for the service. Our waitress was Merna and she was top notch. She was very friendly and always made sure our party had everything we needed. She was always ready to take our orders for more shrimp even after she had just put shrimp on our table. She kept our glasses full of drinks the whole night and made us feel very welcome and comfortable. The best service at a Red Lobster that I can remember!"}
{"text":"We eat at this Red Lobster every few months and we've never been disappointed. The food is tasty, the portions are generous, and the service attentive. It's not fine dining, but for a reasonably priced, casual, good quality meal it's great."}
{"text":"Good luck even getting seated. 4 rude staff members trying to figure it out with plenty of tables. What's up with this place? If they can't seat customers can they cook for them ? Don't know we left."}
{"text":"I love Red Lobster! The food is always awesome no matter what location I go to. But this one has the worst service! This is my second time here in the past 6 months, both times I've had to wait for a table to be cleaned before I was sat. Normally this doesn't bother me... But both times after waiting and being escorted to my table, while walking through the restaurant all the empty tables were dirty.  Also, both times I was able to go through the entire menu, discuss with my boyfriend what we were ordering, debate back and forth on what appetizer we were going to get before our server even greeted us to take drink order. This happened at our 1st visit, so this time we just happened to glance at the clock after we were seated (we had a feeling we were going to get the same kind of service after we saw all the tables were dirty again) it took our server over 15 minutes to greet us for drink orders and then another 5-10 minutes to get our drinks and might I add we ordered a water and a Sprite.   And it's not just that we had bad luck with servers... Another couple walked in the same time as us. After they waiting for their table to be cleaned they were seated... in a different section then us but we could still see their table from ours. After we waited and finally got our drinks we looked over and saw they were just placing their order for drinks.   I'm an incredibly patient person, and I've worked in the industry so I'm not one to complain if you can tell there is a shortage of staff or they are incredibly packed. My 2nd time I saw at least 4 servers walking around my section and not even half the tables had people at them."}
{"text":"I just visited this red lobster and it was great. The ambiance of the restaurant isn't typical of red lobsters I've previously seen. My waitress was really great- my order was taken fast and food came out quick. My waitress Tracy was really good about checking on the table, which was nice!"}
{"text":"So the lobsterfest commercials finally got to me and off to red lobster me and the boyfriend went.  We got in right away although it was pretty busy and we were lucky enough to get the best waiter everrrrr. His name is patrick B, he has the oddest voice on a man I've ever heard. He sounds like he's straight out of like the 1800's deep south.  We got the 2 app deal - stuffed mushrooms and the mozza sticks. The mozza sticks were really good crispy and nice and hot.  Our apps were still being cooked so Patrick brought out our salads first along with the infamous biscuits ( omg yummmmm).  The stuffed mushrooms were decent but not the best ever, all I could taste was broccoli which I presume was added.  Our food came out shortly after, I had the seafood feast and my boyfriend had the ranibow trout.  My food came out piping hot, and I dug in. My boyfriend's dinner came w/ broccoli (again with the broccoli) and he asked if asparagus could be substitued. Patrick said they normally chatge but he would see what he could do, he came back to say they would switch and it would just be a few minutes while they cooked it fresh - how nice!! At the end of the meal I hadn't eaten everything so patrick boxed up my meal, my boyfriend mentioned that I loved using the little fish fork, and patrick came back w/ a little dish of butter to go AND a shrimp fork for me to take home!!   Best service bar none at this red lobster, if you go ask for patrick!!"}
{"text":"We had a really great time and I made sure to let the manager know before we leave. From the time we came in, the hostess was nice and friendly and our waiter(s) (we had our waiter but asked the other one for a couple of things) were amazing! The restaurant itself was quiet. The waiter brought everything without us even having to ask (refill drinks, biscuits). The food portions were huge and we took a lot home. Everything was fresh and warm. Wonderful staff. Great atmosphere. Will definitely come back very soon!!!"}
{"text":"I expected more. After a bit of a wait, we were finally put at our table. The food was wonderful but our server, Stuart, not so much. He started off polite but then his mood changed to demanding and bothered. I get that we are keeping you from going out to the bar on a Saturday night, but I am paying YOU to eat and be taken care of. I watched as he walked around with no regard for other people, and they MOVED out of his way. Not classy Red Lobster. I will be calling corporate, I specifically made this account just to warn others, if you want less then better service, ask for Stuart. What happened to all the good servers? That place was such a good restaurant 4 years ago, maybe they decided to hire on a bunch of kids? My husband was very angry and now refuses to go back. We definitely tipped much less than we usually would have. I'm sure all the empty tables around us was a sign that everyone else got to leave and Stuart was stuck with us. Thank you for our absolutely crap dining experience, happy birthday to my husband."}
{"text":"Not a huge fan of red lobster, but they even fall below that standard.  I had the special lobster/shrimp combo and was not impressed at all. The lobster was small, dry, and obviously not fresh. The shrimp was cooked well, but totally drowned in butter. Several other people in the group also ordered the same special and had the same experience. This is the only time I've eaten here so I cannot say if this is the status quo or just a really bad cook on shift."}
{"text":"Great food and great service Virginia our server was excellent. Very professional and very attentive on our request. If you can request for a server I highly recommend her."}
{"text":"Why do I keep going back expecting different results. I ordered the split crab legs. The we're dry, almost crunchy. Truly awful. The must microwave them to warm them up. Bill came to $95 for hubby and I.  I don't mind paying but this was definitely not worth the price  the baby potatoes were not scrubbed.  They had dots of dirt on them. The cutlery was dirty...have I finally learned not to ever go back there again?!!!"}
{"text":"Worst Red Lobster experience I've ever had, and I've been to many around the US. The food was terribly seasoned and cooked even worse. Very disappointing franchise."}
{"text":"I always come to red lobster for lobster fest. Can't beat the lobster lovers dream. I also ordered the new dueling lobster plate. Absolutely delicious.  I always make sure I have room for the stuffed mushrooms. That's a must try. My server Mary was so nice.  All the workers are nice and polite. Definitely recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"I used to work there. I know for a fact that ALMOST EVERYTHING is microwaved. Go to a quality seafood restaraunt"}
{"text":"It was quite crowded on a Saturday night but luckily we got a seat right away. My friend and I shared the Ultimate Feast ($32.50) which came with a salad and another side. We got the Caesar salad and biscuits which were great. Didn't enjoy the crab and lobster as they were very salty but the shrimp were delicious. My other friend got the Seaside Shrimp Trio ($23) which she said she would get again.  I would come back for the shrimp."}
{"text":"Outstanding as good as it getts perfect waitress and food and experience!! Little pricy but cant argue with food on  1-10 at least an eleven. Thanks"}
{"text":"Took my mother to the Robinson Red Lobster, which she used to enjoy. At exactly noon on a Sunday, the restaurant was only about 20% full. Our waitress hurried us along while saying she was not rushing us. The menu is over 20 pages long. The waitress really wanted us to get that order in. She came back 3 times until we were ready to order.  She said at the third time \"If I give you too much time, you will change your mind too much\". Ok so here comes the salad, mine is ok, the blue cheese was below standard. My mother's salad was mostly composed of white bitter leaves.  She ordered coconut shrimp, it was tasty but the shrimp had been smashed to a thin layer to make them look bigger.  I ordered the captains platter, again smashed shrimp, paper thin fish fillet, and very tiny scallops.  Way more breading than you would have even at long johns silvers.  In fact the meal was simply worse than my childhood memories of Long John Silvers. Please note I do not consider long john silvers a good seafood restaurant by any stretch of the imagination. A long time ago Red Lobster was tasty. I'm afraid this was our last visit."}
{"text":"Never again, date night at Red Lobster. I should of listened to my family who has told me of the many times they have gotten food poisoning here. We were lucky, no food poisoning however the food was horrible. The only good thing about our night was we were taken right away, our server was nice, and our appetizer was taken off our bill. The food was undercooked, tasted like it was two days old, and we were missing parts of the meal (shrimp).  Drinks came at the end of the appetizer and we never got the extra plate we asked for...So far Red Lobster will not be on our list of restaurants to dine at."}
{"text":"I've always had a excellent experience in north Olmsted red lobster. But I recently went to go eat there with my family and everything was dirty. I sat down at our table and it was sticky. So I decided to spill a little of my water to wipe it with their cloth napkins. As soon as I did it was all black and green. I told the waitress and she blamed it on their cleaner saying it was not a good kind. I said ok and let it go I then opened up all the napkins to pass out the silverware and most of the silverware were disgusting. I was shocked. I got so grossed out but did not want to ruin my kids experience and dinner. I told the waitress and she didn't seem shocked or embarrassed. She just said she'll give us new ones. Just terrible."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the food......i ordered the steak and crabs. So worth it. It was a little messy obviously cuz of the crab but very tasteful. i also ordered a great drink called bahama mama. So good.......mmmmm. It was surprised the drinks are very cheap. so going again. Services was alright. Could of been better."}
{"text":"Ok so maybe it was a busy week day Wednesday, it took 50 minutes to get our food and that was after the we wait 20 min for our appetizers.  Once the food arrived it was at most luke warm.  I could tell it was had been sitting under the heat lamp.  The lobster was dried out.  Not the great service I've had before.  Even when we were offered free deserts to only be told they were out of the key lime pie...really seriously!  Come on Red Lobster get it together...  not the service or great food I've had before."}
{"text":"Came with a party of 8 for a 16th birthday on a Friday night. We were seated quickly and had 2 servers taking our order within minutes. Derrick and Tanya were excellent. They had refills coming out for our drinks before we finished the first ones. Food was seasoned well and everyone loved their meals. Excellent food and excellent service! Will definitely return soon."}
{"text":"It's Red Lobster. It's not the greatest, but it's pretty good. Went tonight and service wasn't great. Our waitress was kind of snappy (rude) and slow to get our orders and items to our table. The food was good. Probably would have been a much better experience with better service."}
{"text":"I haven't been to Red Lobster in North Olmsted, Ohio for about a year. Before and after the only Joe's Crab Shack in the Cleveland area closed, it was my go to seafood place. I was rarely disappointed by anything other than the wait time to be seated. The place was always packed.  Yesterday afternoon, my spouse and I decided to treat ourselves and we went to Red Lobster once again. Not everything was disappointing. Their Cole slaw is fresh, crispy and has just enough dressing to bring it together. Lovely stuff! The cheese biscuits were just their usual tasty selves. The shrimp was okay. But the crab legs were mushy and stuck like glue to the shells. The supposed lobster tail was either a very undersized lobster or a langostino tail. I've eaten a lot of lobster in my time but none as small as these. The service, once we were seated, which was quickly, was slow and really less than average. It was a good 15 minutes before the waitress appeared to take our drink orders. Getting the drinks and taking our orders was another 15 minutes. We were there at about 3 pm. The place had quite a few empty tables at that hour, but our waitress told us that they had two large groups to take care of. The food finally appeared after 40 minutes. I had asked that they leave the rice usually included on the plate off of it. We asked for more biscuits. We got neither although we were assured she would take care of it. We didn't complain but that was indicative of the focus she had on her customers. We waited again for a long time to pay our bill and when she arrived with our change she told us again about the difficulties of waiting on large parties. We just wanted to pay our tab and leave but had to listen to excuses for very inattentive service. Swinging by the table twice to ask \"How's everything?\" is not attention to the customer. I did leave a tip, but not my usual 20%. I won't be back.l"}
{"text":"We decided to go for lunch b4 shopping and parked quite fast in the lot.Coming in we had a five min wait to be seated but the decor was neat and lobsters in the tanks to look at added fun.We were seated in a cool booth by a window overlooking the street.Our server was a cool guy(didnt catch his name but he was nice.The food was delish-surf &turf and we ate most of it(a bit leftover steak for our dog)My son had the Captains catch which he enjoyed as well.I had a long island iced tea-which was smooth.My husband had coke(he was driving)...all good."}
{"text":"We went there a few months ago and the food was horrible. I was very dissapointed and will NOT be going back, especially for what it costs, and then to have yucky food is horrible. :/"}
{"text":"Everything was great! It was the best service that i have had in a while. We had a party of 10 and everything came out super fast and accurate. Great job Red Lobster Las Vegas. Mary and Jesus were excellent."}
{"text":"Highly recommended place according to me. Love the food and the service. Only thing is the wait time whenever I go I have to wait for atleast 15 minutes. But it's worth the wait I feel. Love it."}
{"text":"Extremely long wait between appetizers /salads coming out and the main course. Server disappeared after dropping off food. Food was overcooked and dry. Restaurant was dirty and crowded (on a Wednesday night). I guess what can you expect from a chain restaurant like this. Not a great experience and would not recommend anything about this place."}
{"text":"Since there's no Red Lobster in Vancouver, and I was in Toronto for school... but never went to Red Lobster in those 4 years...  I finally decided to go there after my last exam as an undergraduate student.  The waitress' service was okay, nothing special.  However, I think the food can be better. The lobster was dry, the shrimp was dry... the aspragas was charged extra but didn't taste good... it was dry too!  Basically the food was... b a d ... simply put it. For the price of the menu that we ordered, I could get so much better food!!!   oh... the ONLY good thing about the food was, the buttery, GREASY biscuit we got as SIDE... lol  anyways, it was my first time in Red Lobster... so expected more! but it was a disappointing experience :-("}
{"text":"Dinner time!!  Its Saturday so a \"40 min\" wait is nothing unusual!! Service... the only reason it got three stars! Food- the only reason to ever go to Red Lobster is the Cheddar biscuits!!!!! Fresh and hot! We should have stopped there! Don't listen to Beyoncé!!!!  The kitchen seemed rushed an inattentive and multiple patrons were sending plates back including our table from .... not only was the steak still \"moo-ing\" instead of a whole new plate they recooked the same steak ... I mean I'm all for recycling but.... somehow that just seems like a culinary no no esp with steak ... but none the less the biscuits are the best !"}
{"text":"???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"Slow service but friendly. Lobster roll much smaller than pictured. Overall disappointing"}
{"text":"After arriving at 7:45pm... It is currently 9:19pm and we have not received our food. We have officially died of thirst and have not had the pleasure of getting more rolls.   Update we just got the food @ 9:23pm and they they made my trio a duo because they ran out of salmon...   I award you no points, and may God have mercy on your soul."}
{"text":"I had a pretty undesirable experience at this particular establishment. The atmosphere isn't very inviting. My wife rated her experience there with me as decent whenever we talk about it, but as mediocre as she makes it sound, I seem to have had a vastly different experience that same night. I'd like to say however that our waitress was A+. She was tremendously professional & inviting. Everything else is downhill. Before I get into the food, the family that was sitting somewhere close to our table seemed to have had a problem with the restaurant's allergy accommodations. That actually got my family's night off to a bad start because it made for a very tense and noisy ambiance; since there was a loud controversy insuing. As for the food of course... horrible! I think this was my first time eating at \"Red Lobster\" and I can say that it will probably be my last. I was expecting so much more but this experience left me damningly disappointed. We ordered calamari as an appetizer. This calamari did not taste anything how it's supposed to taste, especially from \"Red Lobster\". It was way over-cooked and tasted very dry & bland. My wife said her fish dish was very mediocre at best. As for my seafood linguini, it may very well have been the most disappointing part of the whole evening. Picture a young baby vomiting up half puréed seafood. Now pour that substance on to the linguini. I'm not even exaggerating. That's how bad the dish was & the best way I can explain it. It was very mushy food & didn't taste the greatest neither. The pasta was decent I suppose, but it's pretty hard to screw that up right? Oh I forgot to mention the biscuits. Chewy like gum and tastes awful. This entails my personal experience here. Like I said, I expected so much more from this place and it didn't come even close to meeting my expectations."}
{"text":"Not any bad thing I can say about Red Lobter  because its my grandmas favorite place to go so once or twice a year Red Lobster here we come."}
{"text":"Sit in the bar, ask for Jim. Food was basic, hence the 3 stars, but Jim ' s service is spot on! He has been with Red Lobster for 14 years,  very experienced.   Would have been 5 stars if the food would have.. A) Been fresh B) Cost a lot less for a previously frozen meal C) Had a better rum selection for as many rum based cocktails they serve(Bacardi? YUCK!) D)Not come to the table reheated in a microwave (chocolate chip molten cookie)"}
{"text":"Cool as long as you don't mind seeing parasites in your seafood. After I showed the manager, He offered me a gift card and didn't charge me for my horrible experience and my parasite infested crab legs. Disgusting, needless to say, I won't be returning here & after this experience I'm probably never going to eat crab again!!! Thanks! Picture posted in photos!"}
{"text":"Service was horrible.  We got there (5 of us) when they first opened at 11:00.  We didn't  get our alcohol until 15 minutes later.  There were only two tables of people in the restaurant.  The food took forever and we didn't get ours until 11:53 and we were the first ones there. The table of four next to us got their food before us and left before we even got ours.  Alicia, the server never came back to see if we needed soda or water refills.  Took forever to get seconds  on alcohol.  We had to ask for the soup and asparagus again since we didn't receive it.  We asked for extra biscuits and she said they were in the oven.  The tables next to us got theirs.  Where was ours?  Still in the oven?  Never going back there again.  I wanted to go to Outback Steakhouse.  Don't waste your time here.  Finally got out of there at 12:40.  Very, very disappointing."}
{"text":"Finally found the BEST Red Lobster in the whole surrounding Phoenix area.  Cannot compare to the others down here.  We loved the one in Appleton WI and this one is just like it.  Moved here 3 yrs ago. Very clean, excellent décor, spacious and super friendly staff.  The food was great AND those biscuits are for sure the best in this area.  Worth the drive for us down there from Fountain Hills.  Check it out, you will LOVE it !"}
{"text":"We eat at Red Lobster 3 or 4 times a year. We enjoy the food and service. And yes, the biscuits."}
{"text":"Went for the lobster feast. The staff is friendly and offered excellent service  the food was excellent as always. Been to two other locations in town and the Henderson location is by far the best for both service and taste."}
{"text":"Came here the other night with a couple friends to fulfill our annual Red Lobster craving. One order of stuffed mushrooms, Three Ultimate Feasts, a chocolate brownie, and countless cheddar biscuits later and we were very full and satisfied customers.  The value is standard and the food is good and reliable (you always know exactly what you're getting), but the service here is always particularly great.  See you again next year!"}
{"text":"Had the endless shrimp last night, and was more than satisfied!  Tried 3 or 4 different kinds of shrimp, and they were all fantastic.  My girlfriend and I left stuffed as can be.  We will go back."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I wish that I can put -5 stars My wife and I went to celebrate our anniversary, so we both ordered the shrimp feast.  The waiter was very very rude even though we told him it's our anniversary. We are still waiter provide us with his recommendations, his response was you have five choices pick any two. Few minutes after he came by and asked us to pick one choice, so we picked one choice each. He came by again and asked us for one more choice, we picked another. Again he came by and asked if we have another choice, we told the guy that sits for us. Few seconds after I found that he brought the cheque book without asking us if we would like desserts or at least because we are celebrating our anniversary to promote something else. I got upset so I pulled my credit card and I put it on the top of the cheque book. He brought the credit card machine and did the transaction again without asking us if we would like dessert or coffee. I finish the transaction and I gave the guy 20% tip. In my way out I told him that he should have asked us if we would like desserts or coffee and his response was oh and I forgot to ask you. From this experience I will never go again to Red Lobster, this is really upsetting."}
{"text":"For a moderately priced, chain restaurant, this Red Lobster location is really good.  I've never had a bad meal here...I do order from the 'fresh' side of the menu.  My last dinner there was during the 'crab fest' and I ordered salmon with a crab 'hollandaise' type of sauce on top.  My companion ordered the fresh trout.  Both of us loved our dinner and the service was attentive and professional.  I think this restaurant provided excellent food  and service for the price!"}
{"text":"The first time I went to the red lobster, they have a special offer in the fall, that is, casually eat shrimp, a person 22.99 $, including a salad, five flavored shrimp casually eat, other rice casually eat, but the need for a single drink. Offer lasted until October, I recommended try once a time."}
{"text":"We travel around and are in Cleveland area today. Tried this restaurant while waiting for our flight. Not very far from the airport. The food was good, nice atmosphere. The service was very slow. The crab"}
{"text":"We visit this place often and it has gone downhill... The hostess' hair was unkempt and uniform looked filthy!! No diversity here at all!!! Secondly, we came another time in July and waited to be seated because there wasn't a host available. The manager appeared to be hosting which she didn't look too happy about it either. There's always different managers every time you look around. The food was just okay. Service is good. Then we started requesting Mandie and she is awesome!!!! We love Red Lobster!"}
{"text":"The amount of fat and sodium in everything we had was ridiculous, and with all that the food was still bland. I haven't been to this restaurant in years and now I remember why. Waste of money and calories"}
{"text":"I would not eat here because I don't care for extra mucus with my meal.  The parent company, Darden, is threatening to turn full-time employees into part-time employees in order to dodge the requirements of the Affordable Care Act.  Do you want your food handled by people who can't afford a doctor's visit because they are uninsured part-timers, AND they can't afford to miss a day of work if they are sick, because they are part-timers?"}
{"text":"The good was excellent. The waitress was awesome. Very attentive. Some of the best lobster ever. The portions tonight were plentiful. You must try the shrimp lettuce wraps. A+++"}
{"text":"Hard to go wrong with broiled fresh fish, and they do it well here.  Service is very good, waits have not been long.  Cheese biscuits are as good as they've always been.   Any fish we've had has come out perfectly done - melt in mouth, not dry, not over seasoned.  This location is very good."}
{"text":"The first time I went to this location I went because I had a gift card to use.  Unfortunately  the gift card system wasn't working. So, my choice was to either wait 45 minutes to an hour for them to fix the machine or pay a different way and come back again. A total inconvenience to myself and my fiance.   The second time I came here my experience was absolutely amazing!  Our server, Harrison, was extremely professional and courteous the entire time. My thoughts were that since my fiance and I shared one dish and an appetizer and the server knew that we were pay with a gift card that we would get the cold shoulder (I've worked in a restaurant before so I know how servers can be) Nevertheless, Harrison treated us well and made us feel welcomed.   Oh, and the food was amazing!"}
{"text":"I had a bad experience just waiting to be seated.  It was my mother in law birthday and we walked out because they took so damn long and the hostesses were some bratty girls ....WE ENDED UP DRIVING ACROSS THE STREET TO ASIA BUFFET INSTEAD ."}
{"text":"Well, we decided to give red lobster another go since they split from darden. I was kind of shocked how messy the floor was when we went in but someone came out and swept it. We ordered iced teas. Fiancée got aim and I ordered peach. The first glass was very flavorful but the refill was weak.  We got crab artichoke lobster dip for an appetizer and it was tasty. I got the broiled trio for dinner, my fiancée got the coconut shrimp. Both entrees were ok.  I must mention our server Jenna. She was sweet and attentive without being intrusive. Very nice young lady.  We were too full for dessert so nothing to review"}
{"text":"One of our favorite restaurants. I like the 4 course meal with the cajun alfredo chicken for $18.99 or seafood combos for around $25-30ish range. The servers at this location are excellent. Penny, Erica & Jesus will put a smile on your face guarenteed."}
{"text":"Lunch today!!  Wood fired shrimp shewers. wild rich pilaf and brocolli.  Wonderful and Service was friendly and attentive!!  Will difinitely be back!! cheese biscuits appetizers were good too!  Got busy while we were there, Restaurant was clean."}
{"text":"5 stars hands down. Had a party of 7 and our waiter Alvester(Jersey) was absolutely AWESOME! It's so hard to find good service these days, but he exceeded our expectations. Alvester was working tables, and the bar but yet we never felt neglected. He was on top of everything. He came in at a very hectic time but you would have never known it. He kept a smile on his face the entire time and stayed in good spirits. 5 star service! The food was also delicious. Nice, and hot. I would suggest anyone to ask for Alvester by name, I know anytime I return to this location that I will. Excellent experience!"}
{"text":"We went to dinner Thursday's, July 6, 17. Two of our party had the Fish and Chips and substituted the chips for a salad.  The fish was dry in parts and parts of the fish were uneatable. The Fish Tacos were good. The dinner salads are awful. The salad is from a bag that they don't rewash to bring back the freshness they don't severe them in cold bowl, they throw a few croutons on them and serve it. Sadly, the waiter knew the fish was dry and could clearly see parts of it was not being eaten and did not say a word."}
{"text":"I've been to quite a few of the Red Lobsters in the GTA, but this was a disappointment. I went in around 9 PM on a Saturday and ordered the unlimited shrimp. My friend had the ultimate feast. I got the hand breaded shrimp and the Nashville shrimp for the first round. The Nashville shrimp was good, the hand breaded was OK. The next round was the garlic shrimp and Mediterranean shrimp. The garlic shrimp was served in a bowl which was previously used and wasn't clean ( yyeeewwww). It clearly had been used earlier for garlic butter shrimp before and the same bowl was used for this - GROSS. Never coming back here again !!! and never having unlimited shrimp again in any red lobster !!!"}
{"text":"Only one star for this location today Friday at lunch went and sat at the bar and no one was working. Sat there for a good 8 min looked at the menu and not one person said hi, be right with you, nothing. Won't be going back to this place."}
{"text":"Personally I love Red Lobster and have usually had very good experiences or at least at the one in Flint, MI!  My husband and I were so excited that a Red Lobster was going to be right down the road from us.  We quickly found out that this place had a lot to learn!  The staff was not very friendly and more concerned with socializing than checking on their tables.  Our waitress messed up simple things with our order, did not check on us to see how the food was, and did not refill our drinks.  As for the meal, the biscuits were dry and old tasting.  I ordered the salmon with a lemon garlic sauce, however I did not know that my fish would be swimming in the sauce.  I was highly disappointed and will not be returning to this location!"}
{"text":"Howard gave us phenomenal service and we were able to see what menu items were Gluten Free as they had a table content breakdown. The food taste is important but not more than the exceptional service provided by Howard. Jesus loves you all and God bless."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant .. yummy food, great atmosphere and good service.. I was there with family for lunch and we asked for quick service and we got exactly what we asked for.. the staff was friendly and the food was delicious .. it's clean and warm environment.. lovely for family dinners or date night .. nothing compares to it's fresh seafood .. I especially love the grilled salmon and lobster tail plate.."}
{"text":"What can I say, with Joe's Crab Shack long gone this is it except for the pricey non-chain seafood restaurants. I've been loving RL since I was a kid. The prices are reasonable for seafood & they do a good job cooking it too. The stuffed mushrooms are a favorite of mine. Stuffer flounder & coconut shrimp are my go to dinners. & the biscuits are so darn tasty ! My only gripe is they're short staffed some of the time. So you gotta wait 10 -20 min for a table ( longer during dinner time) But it's worth it."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday. Got the trio. All the dishes were delicious especially the coconuts shrimp! Service was okay. The biscuits are amazing, Could have just ate those and been satisfied."}
{"text":"**4 stars could have been 5 easily**  Last night my wife and I came for supper and had the \"Endless Shrimp Special\" Red Lobster has been advertising.  Upon our entry, I quickly noted that their wasn't anybody standing or sitting ahead of us. We were greeted right away with a friendly smile from Cecilia. She took note that it was just the two of us and told us it would be about 10 minutes for us to be seated. I looked down the hall and into the dining area and I could clearly see available tables.  I decided not to say anything about the 10 minute wait.  At the 10 minute mark, Cecilia asked to seat us.  A few minutes later, our server Talia came around with another friendly smile   and asked if she could bring us any drinks/and or place our order as she overheard my wife and I speaking about the endless shrimp.  I have to say that Talia was very prompt with expediting food and making sure that our drinks were never sitting empty for more than a minute or two. Props to her for doing a great job!   My second \"needs improvement\" comment for the evening (the first being the seating time) is directed for whom I assume was the manager. I can only describe her as being long blonde haired lady with a tattoo on her right arm that extends to her elbow. As she was working the floor thanking other customers for coming in and joining in on their respective chit chat at their tables.   She completely ignored us. I held eye contact with her 3 times with half a smile and she just looked the other way as if she was being bothered.... ???  I was going to tell her how well a job her staff was doing and how much we were enjoying our dinner!...but she never came around.   The preparation of the food was spot on!  Every shrimp order that arrived at out table was extremely hot, yet never was the shrimp rubbery to the taste. Perfecto!!  Last night we enjoyed our dinner very much."}
{"text":"It is my first time to be here. I have to say the \"white wine and garlic mussel\" is good, but my main dish has really salty taste. Remember to prepare enough water for that :)"}
{"text":"As always, their biscuits are AMAZING! (I always get two or three servings of biscuits)  and sea foods...? meh... Nothing special...  But one thing you should know is that their service is very good compared to similar level restaurants.  Taste: 3/5(seafood menu), 5/5 (biscuit) Service: 5/5 Price to proportion wise: 1/5 (It's somewhat expensive for what you pay for...) Cleanliness: 5/5"}
{"text":"OK, I admit it...I do have a thing for their cheese biscuits.  Oh my gosh, fresh from the oven, piping hot, is there anything better than those first few bites?  It is a guilty pleasure for sure!     We stopped in on a Tuesday evening & were pleased that we were seated immediately at a booth in the bar area.  It was not loud at all & Patrick (the bartender) was a wonderful server; attentive without being intrusive.   The included salad was tasty as always; their salads, though kind of basic, always seem be perfectly crisped & good.  For my entree, I got the blackened wild caught cod which I couldn't have been happier with.  It was perfectly cooked, tender, moist, flaky, yeah pretty perfect.  Although the \"wild caught\" fresh fish options are more pricey, I am so glad that Red Lobster always has a few non-farm raised options to satisfy my obsession with such things.  Hey, a nice, healthy wild caught fish cancels out the decadence of (several) cheddar biscuits, right?  The rest of the meal was good also, but I was just content filling up on biscuits, salad & the most perfect, delicious cod : )"}
{"text":"Seriously one of the worst meals I've had in a long time. Everything was so ridiculously salty, I swear my blood pressure rocketed after I was done my food.   We came here as a last resort because we were starving, had movie tickets (so we couldn't venture too far away) and there just wasn't much else in the area that sounded like a better option. Plus I was really in the mood for some seafood. I ordered a plate that came with bourbon scallops and bbq shrimp. My S.O got the \"feast\" that comes with lobster, butterfly shrimp,snowcrab and garlic shrimp.   My scallops were disgusting. I felt like I was drinking shots of bourbon with every scallop I ate. My shrimp were coated in a really sticky and lumpy bbq sauce that made them taste absolutely horrid. My bf's dinner was better... the lobster was good, tiny, but good. The shrimp were also good - nothing extraordinary or special about them.   Our server was attentive and friendly, but no ammount of good service could have salvaged my horrible meal. Next time I want to spen $85.00 on dinner (with drinks, tax and tip) I'll go somewhere that won't leave me parched from all the sodium."}
{"text":"Horrible services! I will never go to this Red Lobster again. I well drive the extra miles to get better services  Very very disappointed :( we always leave a tip for our waitress or waiter no matter if it was bad services but this time there was no chance she was getting even a penny. Just horrible"}
{"text":"Well besides sitting at a huge table for two people, the service was good and the food was good even tho it took me and my date forever to figure out what we were going to eat, he decided on the 4 course meal and I got the trio. But those biscuit make you wanna slap your mama there really good. I really enjoyed myself we even took some biscuits home. We also found out that there busyness day is Mother's Day just a lil side note."}
{"text":"Red Lobster is a classic seafood place to bring your family to. The food is always consistent in its quality and tasted great on my experience. The food price was also affordable and my family enjoyed eating at Red Lobster.  One knock that I had about this establishment was that it took long for the food to come and it took a while for or drinks to get refilled.   If they can work on their service, this can definitely be a spot where I would regularly go to eat meals with my family for special occasions!"}
{"text":"For the money, if you're lookin for fried fish and chips, think LONG JOHN SILVERS!! One peice of tasteless fish, mostly batter.  Miss the Sam Adams fish and chips."}
{"text":"Our food was wrong (ordered dish without chicken, came with chicken -- salad topping taking a long time to come out) but was good when it did come out correctly :) appreciated the manager taking care of our check and a very kind server (Alicia) - thanks for great service!"}
{"text":"I go to Red Lobster every year as a birthday tradition, for my last birthday I went to the Red Lobster at Warden and Sheppard. First time I notice staff was friendly but not attentive nonetheless we go seated and made our order, which took quite sometime to arrive. We started eating and noticed a cockroach slowly making its way across our table I was mortified to make matters worst my partner found another one strolling up the banisters. We immediately  called for our waitress, he was very understanding and took the tissue with the roach off the table to asked for our bill and notice that he removed only one order from the bill which we appreciated however, keep in mind that we saw not one but 2 roaches. I would still recommend them but please be very mindful!!"}
{"text":"Pricy but worth it. They know when you need a refill when not asked. They know when you need more biscuits. They put food in boxes when you need  a box. I almost cried of how much great service they give to you. My waiter's name was Terri or terry. I hope he gives you the service I got. Now that is 5-STAR SERVICE!"}
{"text":"It's a Red Lobster, well kept and usually a wait but not too long. If you're not familiar with Red Lobsters, it's a decent American style seafood chain and make sure you try the biscuits."}
{"text":"Langostino and lobster bisque is lobster \"broth\" and chunks of logostino which is not lobster. Still....it tasted good. It arrived in a sloppy bowl, if you know what I mean. Slosh marks, ladle drips. Dirty spoon, dirty fork. Stuffed mushroom caps were horrible: over cooked lobster and no flavour. Crispy calamari with veg was soggy calamari with broccoli only. I returned them ...the second attempt was slightly better in terms of crispness, but still inedible. Won't be back to that location."}
{"text":"Dirty menu, dirty table top, dirty spoon, dirty knife, dirty walls. Yummy langostino bisque.  Expensive salad."}
{"text":"It's always super crowded and the wait is ridiculous. It takes almost an hour just for pick up. The food is good but the wait for the food not good."}
{"text":"Far better options in the same area. Unless you are just craving red lobster skip it."}
{"text":"Food was good, fast service. I tried the shrimp trio and it wasn't bad. Its nothing special but the atmosphere was nice and relaxing."}
{"text":"We were told the wait to be seated was 50 minutes to an hour. We only ended up waiting 25 minutes on a Friday night. Service was good food was great. I always tip 20% unless the service is horrible. When we received our bill there was a \"suggested tip amount\" on the bottom with 20,18, and 15 % but the values were way higher than they should have been. My bill was 52.92 by suggested tip with 20% was 14 dollars.  Just don't trust that or you'll tip a lot higher than you want."}
{"text":"It was once good, but after ten years since I've set foot into a Red Lobster...  I found that a lot has changed and most of the food is OVERLY greasy, in which may be disgusted as butter!  The last thing a person wants to see is their food submerged in grease/butter....  Maybe it was me 10+ years ago, but the food had seem to be a bit more healthy back then...  I can honestly say that the garlic bread muffins hasn't changed one bit!  Such a delightful treat and if i should return... I'll go just for that... A muffin and a beer...  OVERRATED :("}
{"text":"I used to be a big fan of Red Lobster.    A lot of people I know would put their nose in the air and scoff at this, but I didn't care.  I felt that it was a decent place with decent prices and great seafood.   Very consistent.   Well, not any more.   I've noticed a steady decline in the food quality, an incline in price, and, at least at the location that I *used to* frequent (Las Vegas, South Decatur), the service has gone to hell.    The last two dining experiences I have had there have been awful.  The time before last I feel so awkward and uncomfortable with the waiter's attitude and demeanor.. he ACTUALLY reached out to shake my hand when he presented the check.  WHO DOES THAT???    I spoke to the manager and got an aloof, almost insulted response to my complaints.   Not apologetic, at least not in a sense that was anywhere near sincerity.   This last time.. which will be my LAST time eating at this restaurant, The waiter, a young man named Chase, was absolutely off his game, if he ever had one to begin with that is.   First he argues with me about ordering add-ons, trying to sell me on another option that was about 8 dollars more expensive.  Refills on my water, or my husband's iced tea were pretty much out of the question, my ceasar salad came out with hardly any dressing on it and he argued \"this is how I make mine, since most people complain that there is too much dressing.\"   He then took 10 minutes to bring me a side of dressing.  We received a basket with 3 biscuits (for two people), and even though I put the empty basket at the edge of the table, we were never offered more biscuits.   My food arrived.  My fried shrimp (which, it turned out were slightly undercooked) came paired with a side of KETCHUP, instead of cocktail sauce.   This is a seafood restaurant where the staff do not know the difference between cocktail sauce and ketchup!!!    So, then he takes 15 minutes to bring me cocktail sauce.     To sum up:  mediocre, overpriced food, served by idiots.  Unapologetic, apathetic management.  I will not be back."}
{"text":"Don't  know  what happened  to this once fine chain  of restaurant's not near as good  as it used to be I've  been to three locations 2 in pa. & 1 in boardman Ohio, for what you pay the seafood  should  be much better  I guess if you want really good  seafood  head for the coast because  it's not here .it used to be once again  what HAPPENED???"}
{"text":"Been there, will go again. Nice service, food is delicious, love their coconut shrimps!"}
{"text":"I came here with a co-worker last weekend and the service was not great at all. Once we were seated it took 10 minutes for our server to greet us and he didn't even take our order. He had all of 3 tables and said he was really busy so he brought us waters that were dirty. When he came another 10 minutes later he told us we needed to hurry up and order because he had another table he had to put orders in for. WOW. Still he had not taken our drink orders and he brought out cold and hard biscuits. Another 10 minutes went by and still no drinks or fresh biscuits.  We finally decided to ask for a manager and when she came over we explained he very nice but not attentive at all. We requested a new server and she explained that he only had 3 tables so there was no reason he should have been busy and the place wasn't crowded at all. She obliged and apologized and sent us a new server who was a breath of fresh air. She advised us that he never put our orders in and so she had to take our orders again and keep in mind at this point about 15 more minutes had passed. She brought us new silver because ours was dirty and new waters, since there food particles on the glass.   The manager came and spoke to us and explained that he never put in orders and argued that he had, when she new knew for a fact that he hadn't, so she told us our whole meal was on the house and we didn't have to worry about anything, She was very sweet and understanding and we were beyond shocked and grateful. The rest of the meal was wonderful. We only ended up paying for our alcoholic drinks. We had a rocky start but the ending was great!"}
{"text":"As expected our meal was typical for Red Lobster.  The portions were good.  The service was okay.  I had to ask for silverware.  My wife asked to have her salad dressing on the side. It came with the dressing on the salad.  Since we were there around 3:30 in the afternoon they weren't that busy so for a $100 meal I would expect more attention to details. If I  don't sound like I was thrilled I wasn't.  Typical for Red Lobster."}
{"text":"Normally I don't go to chain places but it sounded good.  The food was actually better than expected but our service is why I felt compelled to review.   Our waitress, Marnetta, was the most attentive server I have encountered.  She was above any beyond polite, knowledgeable of the menu, made good recommendations for my husband dinner, and was just awesome.   If you find yourself eating here, ask for her and you won't be disappointed.  She was just amazing!"}
{"text":"We are a family of 8 that went for my daughter's birthday.  She always likes to go for seafood.  Several of the group had shrimp and my husband said that it was very dry and lacked flavor.  His steak was very small and overcooked.  I had fish and chips and most of the \"fish\" was batter.  We called ahead for seating and still had to wait for 15 minutes because there was \"no server available.\"  The restaurant was half empty which I can understand.  The server had just our table to attend to and she didn't pick up one empty dish or fill our water or ask if we'd like another drink.  No dessert or offering was given to my daughter which I thought was unusual for a birthday dinner.  I don't like going to restaurants where I have to clean up my own plate to make room for another!  We were treated like we were basically a bother.  We left a sizeable chunk of change for this bland, lack luster meal and we will not be doing that again.  At this rate, this restaurant will not be around for long."}
{"text":"I have always loved Red Lobster it's just too expensive.  I ordered the steam crab legs w/shrimp scampi the scampi very well seasoned as far as the crab legs I would rather go to Joes crab."}
{"text":"This location has the worst service.   2nd time this year where our meals didn't come out at the same time and the wait staff could care less.    I'll stick to the Pineville location from now on."}
{"text":"2 stars is generous.  The service was good but the food was poor. I had the shrimp tacos. There were 1-2 small shrimp per taco.  They advertise coleslaw dressing but it was just cabbage with dressing on top. Not coleslaw whatsoever. My wife had the lobster tacos with literally slivers of lobster and horrific broccoli on the side.  My mother in law ordered a lobster salad. But what came was a garden salad with again slivers of lobster.  Total waste of time and money."}
{"text":"We had 2 waitresses after a dance game tourney. One was really nice. Five stars. One was really mean and crabby. One star.   3 stars it is."}
{"text":"Well, it's Red Lobster.  You pretty much know what to expect if you've ever been to one.    I went there on a Saturday, around 7pm, and it was PACKED. They said it'd be about an hour wait, and gave us one of those little pager things.  About five minutes later it was vibrating and our table was ready.  Weird.    Like I said, the place was rammed, but the waiter was fast and friendly and told us all about the specials and whatever else was going on that night.  Service was great.    We started with some appetizers, escargot stuffed mushrooms and... something else.  I forget.  It was good though.  My girlfriend had a Red Lobster ceasar, and I had a pint of Blue.  They don't have many beers on tap there apparently.  After the apps were done, they brought us our salads, and right when we finished those off our main courses arrived at our table.  She had the steak oscar and I had the lobsterfest deal with the crab legs and lobster tail and shrimp assortment.  Everything was cooked right and tasted awesome.    It wasn't the best meal I've ever had, but it was decent. I mean it's Red Lobster.  You know?"}
{"text":"Wait time- extremely terrible. The wait is over an hour so I sat at the bar top. I've been waiting half an hour for my entree. I've seen several tables open up in the bar that aren't being cleaned/used. There were people sitting at the bar who were not waiting to eat, who I think should have been asked to move so that those waiting to sit at the bar top could sit. Several people complained that their to go orders said 20 mins but took over an hour.    The super nice waitress Leilani was awesome. She took good care of her tables. However, she was scolded for seating someone at one of the many open tables that I watched sit open for over an hour while the lobby was packed with guests waiting to eat. Like if you were doing your job she wouldn't have to deal with customers who's party could fit in them asking why those tables weren't being used or have to seat them there to keep them happy (& out of the hostess and managers faces) , cut her a break!! I don't blame her!   The food was fine, nothing extravagant nothing wrong with it. I may go back but never again on a Friday night because of it being so packed and the hostesses not even seating folks at open tables."}
{"text":"RL has a good selection of seafood and some very nice combo-meal choices. I do love their fresh warm biscuits and gorge on them. The waiting staff is also very nice and warm.  I usually order for some lobster or crab combo meal and am never disappointed. Their portions are huge and I always end up feeling sleepy after having a meal here. I can go back to this place again and again."}
{"text":"I went to Red Lobster while traveling to the Charlotte Area for business.  I have had much better service and much better food at other Red Lobster restaurants before.    Good: Coconut Shrimp was delicious and hot, I would have liked a little more dipping sauce though. The salad was nice and they added the dressing on the side so I could use  as much or as little as I wanted.   Bad:  Wait time was horrible as there were many open tables and still waited for over 30 minutes.  I think they were a bit understaffed.   Biscuits were barely room temperature if that.  I waited 10 minutes at my table before a server approached me to welcome me and ask for my drink order.   Also, I asked for green beans for my vegetable and they gave me broccoli.   Overall, the service and food was a lot to be desired."}
{"text":"Just went here for lunch.    I had RL on the brain for weeks, as I get their e-blasts, and needed to satisfy my hunger for something fishy.  Errr, something shrimpy.  Mostly I've been to RL for dinner, but didn't have the time or the $25+ bucks most dinners cost.  I decided to give one of their Lunch Specials a try.  Ordered a Lemonade ($3.29) and the Shrimp Tacos ($8.99).    The Shrimp Tacos come with a default side of rice, but I substituted that for a side of fresh broccoli.  I remember their vegetables being frozen and horrible before, but today the broccoli was truly fresh (as stated on the menu) and tasty.  Some of the dinners tend to be on the salty side, but the Shrimp Tacos were not; they were tasty and filling.  I'd give them 7/10 on the Health Meter, because the creamy sauce was applied thicker than I'd have preferred.  The Shrimp Tacos (you get 3 on a plate) were very good.  Served in a mini white tortilla soft taco shell, 3 fresh grilled shrimp sit atop shredded cabbage, and are topped wtih pico de gallo salsa and a somewhat spicy creamy  sauce.  A lemon and lime wedge complete the plate.  I would order this dish again.  Service was just fine, quick, not overbearing and met my expectation.    Overall, I would recommend Red Lobster for a quick, affordable, semi-healthy lunch."}
{"text":"I don't care what everyone else says.... I'm a beginner at eating seafood, and this is right up my alley.   Fresh Oysters are not my idea of a good time, so Red Lobster it is.  I always have a nice time and a great meal!"}
{"text":"I have not been inside a Red Lobster since the days when I used to go with my family as a child back in the late '90s.  Back then I used to think it was such a treat for a Friday night dinner, but as I got older my palette changed and expanded.  Yet, I always retained the fond memories of the seafood smell and pressing my face against the glass tank in order to get a better view of the live lobsters in the lobby.    Since they had their grand opening yesterday for this new location in Matthews, I wanted to try them out for nostalgia's sake, so when my friends asked me to join them I was ready to go.  This new location's décor is part of the Red Lobster's parent company's, Darden Restaurants, new concept for the brand.  Gone is the stodgy look of the past; in its place is a nautical-inspired look that evokes its faux New England marine time heritage.  Despite being busy, we were quickly seated and our waitress was very attentive and accommodating.  I had the typical lobster with vegetables and it also came with pasta and shrimp.  The food was fine, but I felt that there was a little too little of the lobster and a lot more of the shrimp and everything else.  (They lost a star right there.)  The lobster pieces that I could find were pretty decent. The vegetables were cooked evenly and sautéed just right while the pasta was tender and delicious.  It was reasonably priced for a seafood dish containing lobster.  Overall the food was good, but not necessarily outstanding, but good enough to want to go there once in a while.  The Red Lobster feels like a perfect place for families with its kid-friendly menu, and judging from the many children I saw last night it was mostly a family affair.  The Red Lobster makes you think back to when you were a child all over again, but sometimes nostalgia is not enough of a pull to become a regular customer. Finally, I rate this place as a 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"I really like this place, the service and food are good, prices are reasonable and the cheesy biscuits! Never had a problem here and I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Been to this particular location a number of times and and is my go to seafood place if I am in the area, staff is polite and attentive LOVE the new Chili Shrimp appetizer, hint hint make it a full meal!!! Was there for my birthday and they made it fun without being embarrassing. I have seen some bad reviews by some pre-madonnas who seem to be full of themselves thinking they are some kind of professional food critic. If you are that stuffy, why even go to a chain restaurant? SMDH.  Go to the place and enjoy the food."}
{"text":"Just finished lunch. Mom had the gluten free steak and fries, dad had the surf and turf. I had same as mom except baked potato. All was very good, the biscuits were OK. A little over seasoned on the top bit passable. Waiter was kind and knew about celiac problems so helped mom make a good choice. I think some of the previous comment by diners happened because they were here at the wrong time. I'd visit here again."}
{"text":"My second trip to Red Lobster happened about 2 weeks ago but it's just been crazy past 2 weeks. To be honest I wasn't even going to blog about this place but I found 3 decent photos on my phone so I thought I might as well share these.  My first trip to Red Lobster was about 4 years ago in New York. This much hyped up (in Vancouver cause we don't have Red Lobster there) franchise restaurant pretty much disappointed me with pricey yet big portions of bad quality seafood. Price-wise, I believe it was almost 30-40% more expensive compared to regular Red Lobster cause it was located in Time Square (tourist trap, duh). The food was mediocre and it's their fault they make their advertisements look so good :P  However, I gave it another try with my family in Toronto and I am glad I did. Whenever you order a main dish, it comes with a salad and some biscuits to start off. You get a choice between caesar and garden salad, and the biscuits are re-fillable. Caesar salad was well done but the biscuits were a bit salty.  For the main dish, I had the Shrimp trio (deep fried shrimp, butter shrimp and shrimp fettuccini) that came with baked potato (there is an option of baked/mashed/scalloped/etc). It is def big in portion and I would recommend getting 3 main dishes for 4 people. Deep fried shrimps were a bit on the dry side but it went well with the cocktail sauce that came with it. Butter shrimps were my favorite but the shrimps were kind of on the small side- and the shrimp fettuccini was decent.  I would def go back and try one of their famous lobster dishes if I had the chance."}
{"text":"Horrible  experience. Went with my husband a to start the place had a funky smell like sewer water. After we were seated waiter told us that the table we were given was assigned to someone else and that we had to wait or sit at the bar. Never heard  of such thing. We went to the bar the last 2 seats at the end next to the kitchen. For my suprised the kitchen was horrible. The funky smell came from the kitchen, food, water all on the floor, waiters stepping on it, I gaged and could not consider eating here. I got up and had to leave. I will never go back to any Red Lobster again after what I saw in that kitchen."}
{"text":"Hey now we had David as a server. I believe that was his name?. Very on the ball, very attentive, and just a great service overall. Food was pretty decent we would go back again."}
{"text":"Great customer service at this location. The food is great if you're not counting calories and everything minus the beverages has butter. My husband loves shrimp, so this is our go to place for shrimp anything.... :)"}
{"text":"I was surprised at how impressed I was with the Bay and Dundas location. We (party of two) went on a very busy day, but were seated in reasonable time. The service was actually exceptional, it really stood out, especially where it is both a chain and a family restaurant. Everything that we ate was very good, and the food/appetizers arrived on time & cooked exactly as requested.   Extra bonus points because the biscuits are SO good- it seems to be everyone's favourite thing. I have been to Red Lobsters before, and found them to be very average, but my experience at this one was great. I will for sure be going back."}
{"text":"I always get the same thing and always like it. Shrimp and crab legs. But drink one beer prior to meal."}
{"text":"I have eaten here several times and the food has been very good. My last visit was different. I had the Sirloin steak w/  melted blue cheese. The steak and potatoes must have been under a heat lamp for a very long time. The steak was one of the worst I have had in a while. It was very tough and over cooked. The mashed potatoes had a crust over them (from the heat lamp?) On the plus side the server was good and funny."}
{"text":"Drinks were great. But...Damn their Seafood needs some change. I couldn't even finish the meal. First bad experience though. It may have just been a bad night."}
{"text":"Just had to go to Lobsterfest and we weren't disappointed.  I had the ultimate feast and my husband had the surf & turf.  We started with the stuffed mushrooms for appetizer (not the best part of the meal) but it was free as I had a coupon.  If I have any complaint its that we got sooo much food we couldn't eat it all.  Our waiter, (Addison I think) was fantastic.  We never had to ask for refills and he continually checked to see if we needed anything.  We had a nice quiet booth and it was a great evening all around."}
{"text":"Where to start? It was surprisingly busy for a weeknight, but the wait for a table was still longer than it should have been. Multiple tables sat empty within view, but apparently they were low on wait staff so couldn't seat us.  That was frustrating.  Once seated, our waitress was friendly and the bright spot of the evening.  The food and drinks are high priced, at least compared to typical restaurants like this. The beer selection was very poor.  No local taps are offered. The cheddar biscuits were heavily salted, almost to much to handle. We had the crab linguine, and it to was overly salted. The crab couldn't even be tasted, as the salt overwhelmed everything.  We had a lobster tail that was rubbery and also lacked flavor, except for salt.  All the food was terribly disappointing.  Overall, this made for a rather miserable and expensive evening.  In Madison there are so many great choices for restaurants that I am amazed that people would even go to a place like this that is overpriced and serves food that is so bad.  I hope to never eat here again."}
{"text":"I will make this short and simple. SHRIMP FEST ENDLESS SHRIMP CHEDDAR BISCUITS...............  My favorite time when Red Lobster runs this special............."}
{"text":"The food was excellent tonight... The server was great. We have been to other Red Lobsters and we have not been satisfied. Tonight the food was fresh and tasted just how I have been imagining... Yum yum... I would definitely cone back to this location..."}
{"text":"Came here with 3 other friends and were seated immediately. Had Greg and a woman (I forgot her name) as our servers in the lounge by the bar. The food was absolutely amazing. Had the admiral's feast And it was so delicious. The service here was also great, both the staff were very attentive and very friendly. Will definitely be coming back soon!"}
{"text":"This is my first visit to any Red Lobster. I've always been curious. I wouldn't be disappointed. Now since it is Good Friday and being an observer of the abstain and fast dealio on this day. I had the clan chowder. Our server El was awesome. Very friendly and obviously loves his job and the regulars here. My mom and my sister had the lobster margarita pizza which was great as well. My dad had the seafood bake which I highly recommend if you love generous portions of seafood. Three half lobster tails and a bus load of shrimp, mussels and scallops on a bed of pasta with a rich buttery sauce. This was outrageous. We all enjoyed our experience. The place was just starting to fill up when we came in around 1245pm but it was packed by the time we left. I would love to come back when I am allowed to eat well. Service, food and speed of the arrival of our order was excellent. Thanks El!! We'll be back."}
{"text":"I would give a two since everything is toooo salty and the king crab wasn't even fresh. The price is relatively high with little quality. Only thin that impressed me was the cheddar bay biscuits"}
{"text":"We decided to check out Red Lobster last night and definitely left without much satisfaction.   The decor was great, the hostess definitely didn't have the professional attitude U expect from what you would expect from a business casual restaurant like Red Lobster. Didn't kick our mood off too well. Our server was pretty amazing in the beginning and helpful and patient with menu options - however the service didn't last long as she all but disappeared. Our apps and kids meals came quick enough, stuffed mushrooms tasted great but weren't stuffed really. We got empty mushroom shells and stuff everywhere in the bowl - ok weird that they choose to serve it so imperfectly but I was hungry and I ate it. Unfortunately, a glass accidentally fell and spilled water all over me as well, and guess what? Waitress didn't show up until 15 minutes later, if it wasn't for another waitress (dreadlocks with bandana, she saved me) who took action to ensure I at least had paper towels to wipe myself. Me and the husbands food took about 40 mins from when ordered which was annoying and strange and one kid was already asleep by that time. I wasn't so irked Cuz we ordered apps and my hunger was semi sated. I asked the waitress as well not to have my pasta in a wine sauce and she agreed due to dietary restrictions. So the kitchen sent my lobster pasta out just in garlic butter? ERM? It was so awkward to have to wait and wait and wait for the server to return to tell her that I really wasn't impressed with just butter as sauce and she just said ok I'll bring you the sauce you like in a cup. I asked her twice to take the pasta back and I would like the kitchen to at least toss it for me to it spreads evenly but she insisted that I do it myself. OK. I don't know much about the culinary arts so I just assumed the kitchen would send out something complimentary for the butter pasta but no, it was Alfredo and tasted hideous when I tried to mix it up. I waited and waited again and finally had to send the hostess to find my server who then came back and agreed to finally have the kitchen remake or do something about the pasta. 15 minutes later and my husband at the end of his meal and patiently awaiting me to begin mine the servers says my food is coming soon. I told her to pack it and she agreed - then I usually don't check the bill but I had a weird feeling and saw she charged me for the lobster pasta even though it only had two bites. I advised her I wasn't going to pay for the wrong pasta especially since I didn't even get to eat what I wanted and basically didn't eat dinner at the restaurant I would only pay for the shrimp and scallop linguini they replaced it with. She then agreed and I saw it costed $10 less. Glad I checked, I still tipped her generously and was looking forward to my shrimp and scallop pasta for lunch the next day. Went home to open the box and no scallops and half the shrimp.  Clearly the kitchen staff didn't have anyone with much experience working that night due to the length of time we waited and the bad presentation of the food and missing food ingredients. Awkward because I expect better from Red Lobster.  Not likely to go back."}
{"text":"Holy cow this place is gross!! Bad food, bad service, bad location. I know it's been their for ever, but so has the smell. I only ate here because my nephew wanted it for his bday. It was a 45 min wait for this place???  ouch!! The soupy Cesar salad not so good, the free biscuits were saltier then I thought. At least the tarter sauce was ok, it help with the wet batter from the shrimp. My wife's ultimate feast was over cooked. The In laws sides (grilled hzucchini) didn't come for 10 mins after meal, and was cold. If you ask anyone besides your waiter for something good luck. The mussels come half with some open and most still closed. Then the manager had to come to approve a new plate with edible mussels. The flavored tea was good and so was the Samuel Adams. This place has never and probably will never do seafood justice. Poor lobsters!!! I bet they're embarrassed to have their names on the sign."}
{"text":"The saving grace is the food, not the service. We came for the seafood and the biscuits, since they no longer have RL at home. But the service was inattentive, though another waitress stepping in for our waitress did save the day. Seriously, how long can you talk to another table while we are trying to flag you down for some service? The four course feast was delicious (though they had to make one substitution because they were out of one item) and plenty of food for us. The dessert was clearly commercial, but nice."}
{"text":"The server was fantastic. The restaurant seemed a little overwhelmed on the rush for a Saturday night. The food was the standard for Red Lobster. So really it's the restaurant's atmosphere and service that make everything different. Here, it was definitely the server, he was attentive even when the room was overwhelming."}
{"text":"So I had a family dinner and everyone there of course loves fish I don't at all so I looked at other things to get on the menu and was not happy with the chicken it tasted like it had been sitting there all day and was so rubbery and just coated in cheap bbq sauce so I ended up just eating the fries and the bread they need more options for people who don't eat just seafood."}
{"text":"Need to hire more servers. Been there twice and both times it was an hour wait and there were empty tables."}
{"text":"Something has changed and the Red Lobster flavor is just not there any more. I was a regular."}
{"text":"This restaurant is understaffed. Waited 30mins before my order was taken. Was short 2lbs of crab legs by a cluster. Still charged regular price. Thieves. And the biscuits were awful. This location is awful. Don't waste your time, nor hard earned money. Ask to speak with the manager, Rachel. She doesn't care. Her enthusiasm, and joy for her job is dead. Folks make the drive to the Matthews location."}
{"text":"I am not going to write a novel about how bad this was for the third time in as many years. It was a high priced disaster. This meal was prepared by lowest level chef, oops, cook it the business. Never again!!"}
{"text":"Wrong order. They almost gave us 16lbs of crab but a guy called and reminded us thank goodness he did though"}
{"text":"went for lunch. took a long time to get to table. food was nothing to brag about. red lobster used to be the best. not no more. the rewards program is hard to access. their website has no place to view it. ill take a long break for awhile."}
{"text":"Food was tasty but the service sux!  I visited @ 3pm on a tuesday ... My server was also handling host ane bartender duties.  Long long long long wait for condiments and extra biscuits.  Tick tick tick down went the tip!  Service is poor to say the least"}
{"text":"I have been to two other Red Lobster restaurants this one is by far the worst I've ever been to I'm giving it two stars because the waiters were amazing. It took them an hour to bring us salads and everything was salty I.e. biscuits, popcorn shrimp and everything else except my fries. Attached is a photo of my breaded tilapia which tasted like a fish that they dumped bread crumbs on.It didn't really look cooked I saw some pink on my fish the waiter was very nice took it back to management who then told him to pass on the message that, that is how it's suppose to be. The breadcrumbs were completely white !!!! The waiter said they will cook it again the second time it came back it was black  . I didn't complain just ate my fish because I was starving. Heads up I think I now have food poisoning."}
{"text":"Food delicious...Jasmine the waitress on a scale of 1 to 10 .....1/2 ...but Mike the manager made up for her incompetence..thanks Mike!"}
{"text":"After waiting a little bit to be seated, we were seated at a dirty and wet table. The waitress was kind enough to wipe it down again for us. My hubby ordered a clam chowder and I ordered a salad, but my salad was brought out after he finished eating his soup. The waitress recognized her mistake and told me, which I said it was fine. After I finished my salad, we started checking on a friends move. Our friend left Cali 5 hours ago at this point. My hubby got restless and we tried figuring out how long we have been waiting...It dawned on me to check our friends status...he had now left 6 hours ago. Realizing we were sitting there with no food and I had lost my appetite, I looked for our waitress and did not see her (apparently she was in the back) when I noticed a lady with a clipboard and asked her if she was the manager. I told her I think we were forgotten about because we have been waiting for an hour (it was actually longer than an hour). She said she'd go check. About 5 minutes later, our waitress came out with our food and told us there was an issue with my steak. My hubby expected our food to be cold, but it was not. They got a star for that alone. My hubby got 2 different shrimps (firecracker and coconut) with the new carrot and squash in brown sugar side dish and said it was very good so they got a star for that. My steak was just steak and the new lobster mash potatoes was just mashed potatoes with gravy poured all over it and about 7 small pieces of lobster sprinkled on top. It was not worth the price because I was no longer hungry after waiting so long. Thank goodness they comped my 1/2 eaten meal for the wait, which is why they got the third star. Knowing us, we will give them a try again in a year. Our visit was last night at 6:30."}
{"text":"Well... aside from celebrating my cousins birthday at Red Lobster... I have one word for this entire Red Lobster experience... AHHHHHHHHHH! Enough said. Go spend your hard earned dollars elsewhere. The servers don't even appreciate what they do, and the food, well, the food speaks for itself.. you'll need a steak knife for that lobster... it isn't like butta!"}
{"text":"There was NO bartender, spent over 80$, shrimp linguini was absolutely disgusting(shrimp way too slimy and pasta was dry) , manager came and checked my id TWICE and still asked me a third time if I was over 21 when im 23 years old ( I guess I look young?) , completely killed my vibe and will NEVER go to red lobster ever again."}
{"text":"I came in on Sunday night, just had a desire for some seafood and wine. I was alone and was greeted nicely but it went nothing but down hill from there... First, I sat there for quite sometime before being greeted by my server, she walked by saying \"be right with you\"...Another person brought me a water 5-10 mins later and then another 5-10 mins later she finally came and said hello and wanted to know if I was ready to order....  I ordered crab legs and some veggies.The veggies were amazing as always... Which you folks really should educate your employees on what can be modified.. The crab legs finally came out and they were awful... I didnt get the tools to crack them so I had to do it with my fork, which didnt matter anyways cause the shells were super soft and the meat very soggy... They tasted like dirt and I used every ounce of butter that came with it... The shells were so sharp that I literally cut my fingers open trying to get the meat out of the shell... It was not the best experience I have ever had.. I know not to get seafood here again.. I may come back for other stuff if I am taken there for dinner, but not again will I take myself there to enjoy seafood..."}
{"text":"Decided to try to give this place another shot.... I love sea food and the biscuits... However... My mistake.. As I should have known better.. I was sitting at the bar this time, and was greeted eventually.. I guess someone called out of work so they were short a person and they were running around trying to keep up... The talking of customers at the bar station was less then amusing, but what really did me in was when I ordered my food I got the green beans, which I always do.. And I asked to have them mushroom free and the lady behind the bar Ashley said they couldnt do that.. So I let her know there was never a problem before when I ordered them and she snapped at me and gave me the worst attitude and made it seem like my request was unheard of. I honestly just wanted to pay for my glass of wine and leave.. This is the 2nd worst time ever and I wish that I would have not stopped here.. I work in a restaurant myself so, I know sometimes things are difficult but,I have never snapped at someone and made it seem like a request was so far fetched... This will be my last time EVER at this place"}
{"text":"This was the WORST dining experience I've ever had my entire life! I cannot believe how horrible the service was. The server, Nicole G was HORRIBLE!!!!! When I say HORRIBLE I mean it took her 15 min to come to our table and take our order, luckily she was \"training\" someone who only came to get our drink order. When Nicole took our order she wasn't friendly at all but at this point we weren't really irritated by the service YET. We order and the food takes 30-40 min to come out. Mind you it's not even busy. Someone else brought our food out and our lobster tails looked DISGUSTING! As soon as they put the plate down I looked at my lobster and knew it was overcooked. Once I bit into it, it was so rubbery! But Nicole was no where to be found to request a new lobster tail and we were starving because we were waiting so long and we just ate it. Also, the biscuits weren't fresh at all so we couldn't even snack on those because they were room temperature. We're in the middle of eating and our drinks were empty for 30 min. We slide the glasses to the end of the table HOPING Nicole would come and fill our drinks up, but of course that didn't happen. Our drinks were empty for 30 minutes!! This is NOT an exaggeration, I know it sounds bad and it was THAT BAD! Then Nicole comes and brings the check! I say I would like more water please but I NEVER got my water.   I walk up to the hostess and I request to speak to the manager. Ten minutes go by and the manager still hasn't came but I'm not even sure the hostess informed him, so Nicole walks by and says are you ready for me to close you out? I said no, I would like to speak to you manager please and she says ABSOLUTELY with the fakest smile on her face. The manager Luis comes and I express my dissatisfaction and how angry we are. I tell him this is completely unacceptable to be treated this way for a meal that isn't cheap ($35 a plate). Luis was very nice and tried to rectify the situation the best he could. He offered us anther lobster, dessert, and even comp'd our entire meal.    The sad part is I feel like Red Lobster is going down hill, my family and I used to go all the time and the only reason my boyfriend and I came tonight was because Olive Garden next door had a 35 min wait and Red Lobster was convenient because it was later. We were here for 2 hours on a Thursday night and it was dead because we got seated right away. I will NEVER come to this location again. But thank you Luis for taking care of us and handling the situation well."}
{"text":"I came into this restaurant to use a gift card and the I am so glad I didn't have to pay. I was appalled by the soggy shrimp, tasteless fish, greasy baked potato and the slop on my girlfriend's plate was atrocious. Everything from the flavor to the appearance was just a jumbled mess of ersatz food. The biscuits may be the only redeeming quality (kind of like the fries at McDonald's), however they are hardly compelling enough to return."}
{"text":"Came in for the advertised Surf and Turf. Got the lobster and sirloin. Lobster was good but the steak was very disappointing. Clam chowder was real good and waitress was very attentive."}
{"text":"I had heard mixed reviews about red lobster, and finally we decided to try it out! I love lobster and it was a rainy miserable day so we wanted to warm our stomachs with some delicious food! I wasn't wrong! The waitress we got was so polite and lovely, and it was busy, yet we weren't waiting longer than the ordinary time..   The selection on the menus was really good, and the drinks selection looked delicious! Pictures too, to help visualise the dishes, which is always a help   The food was so fresh and mouthwatering! Myself and my fiancé ordered clam chowder and they brought out what looked like scones, but it was garlicky bread which was so soft and fluffy! The clam chowder was so rich in flavour! I only ordered a cup portion and himself ordered a bowl, which had biscuits with both..  Next we ordered a trio with a side of lobster mash, and I ordered garlic lobster linguini  All in all, amazing!!  My fiancé ordered 2 mojitos and I ordered a spiked strawberry lemonade, which didn't taste much like strawberry but was so refreshing nonetheless and you get to keep the glass afterward! (Which has the red lobster logo across it)  Our bill came to $112 which wasn't bad considering we ordered lobster, alcohol and I asked for a portion of lobster mash extra cause it was too nice  Would recommend it and will go back"}
{"text":"This was the experience that will keep me from ever going to Red Lobster again.     We came here Saturday Night, because, i have been craving Lobster.  It is Saturday night and we had to wait. No problem, we sat on the balcony & had a nice time.    The hostess was very pleasant and seated us in a nice booth.   The restaurant is under construction, so it looks tacky and smells like chemicals.  Not a great idea to keep open while you are working on it.    Anyway that aside... Our waiter was the absolute worst!!!!  His  name was Bob,my boyfriend got Boston Ice tea and i wanted coffee.  I asked Bob if he would make a fresh pot for me because, i knew it is not popular on a Saturday Night and would be old.  He seemed really put off with that and said it would take a long time. I said i don't mind i am not going anywhere.   Within Minutes he came back with with coffee and the Ice Tea.   The Ice Tea has cranberry juice in it, which is their signature drink.   My coffee was old and cold, no surprise because, he did not make new.    When he came back with our appetizer i said, i am sorry this coffee is old and cold and i cannot drink it. Can i please just have a hot tea.  He said , well i can make a fresh pot. Huh, did i not ask for that the first time. I said, no , i will just have a hot tea.  He filled my boyfriend's ice tea with regular, not the Boston Ice tea he had ordered.    Then he continually ignored our table.  I had to up to the bar to get new ice Tea and hot water for my tea.   Another waiter brought us out our food. Though he could not find the table because,  Bob had put the wrong table number on our check.  This was expensive night out. A $60.00 bill and we were not even drinking alcohol. When you spend that much money, You at least want to have a good dinner. Sadly we will never go here again."}
{"text":"This is a chain restaurant, and I have not had a lot of great experiences at Red Lobster. In fact the time I was in one was in Chandler ,AZ and it was so bad ,I swore I would never return.  But, it was Saturday and my friend who lives close by wanted to go to Red Lobster. This girl has been my friend for about 33 years, and she has had some hard times in the last few years. So I went for her.  Well, it was a Saturday night and right around dinner time. We were seated right away in a booth,(just want we wanted) we were greeted and taken care of immediately by the nicest waiter. Who I am so sorry to say , I do not remember his name. If I do not write something down I forget it very fast.  Anyway ,we had Lobster tail, Lobster Pizza, soup, rolls and fish. Everything was fresh, every thing was hot, and our waiter was right there the entire visit. Looking around I could see they were very busy, and right after we were seated I could see there was a line.  We even got a meal to go,for her Boyfriend. Because, he did not go with us. Even that turned out perfect. Our food and drinks were very good. I even had a chocolate Martini. But, it was our server who made our experience so great. We would definitely go back again any time."}
{"text":"It's lobster fest time, I  simply love coming here,   the rolls are fresh and delicious and complimentary.  I ordered the lobster tails , delicious served with mash potatoes and green beans,  the portion size was huge enough for 2, Definitely everything on the menu is delicious. ."}
{"text":"Well I love sea food, so my review might be biased. Every time I step in (any) Red Lobster they remind me of beach restaurants in California, which to me brings fond memories.   Anyway, Tonight we had lobster tail, crab legs, shrimp scampi and fried shrimp. They were all very good. Their biscuits are a bit on the salty side, but I think I could forego them and not take a star off as the sea food itself was great.   Also, one of our party mentioned that we have a birthday among us, and the staff surprised us with an ice-cream + chocolate desert after our meal, on the house.   The waitress and staff are very courteous and polite."}
{"text":"This has been one of my mom's favorites for her birthday for years. Very disappointed today. From walking in and throughout,  it smelled like old mop.  The biscuits were smaller and didn't seem as tasty as usual. The food didn't wow. It was tasty enough but seemed  skimpy and just not super fresh or good quality. The only good part of our experience was Elle, our server. She was very pleasant and always smiling. I think we'll be seeking out a new seafood restaurant."}
{"text":"I'm not complaining at all. This Red Lobster is great and I really did enjoy the food.  I love pizza.  They have lobster pizza and we had it for an appetizer and it was outstanding.  The lobster and shrimp is good too.  I give it 4 stars simply because of the location.  It's not in the best neighborhood but nevertheless it was good and I appreciated the service as well."}
{"text":"I don't eat at Red Lobster for 2 years, then suddenly, we're there twice in 2 months.   Lobsterfest was still going on and I had a coupon, so since we're now stuck in mid-Ohio again, and Cape Cod trips are officially non-existent at this point, we decided to go back one more time.  We went to the Stow one because it's the closest to where we currently live.   I know the other reviews haven't been so kind, especially on google, but we decided to give it a try anyway.   Husband got the dueling lobster tails (again), I did the one with the 2 lobster tails and pasta (Again).   He got a virgin drink since he was driving and I ordered a Malibu breeze. They came right away with waters and the rolls, then she took our order. We stayed with the tried and true and got the lobster and artichoke dip, which is consistent and very good.   The salads came first though, no complaints. In a bowl, fresh, tasty.  Appetizer was good. We couldn't finish it all before the meals came.   The meals were dropped off piping hot, and everything was fresh, nicely cooked and on the spot. The lobster tails were moist and though previously frozen, not hard or chewy. And as always, the pasta between the lobster tails was firm, a nice al dente for a seafood restaurant, and the sauce was rich and creamy. The langostino lobster on the pasta really had no taste at all, but the shrimp was good.   We really had no complaints. Therefore, I proclaim it a 4 out of 5. And let's hope it's not another 2 years before we go back.   ;)"}
{"text":"Food was amazing and had the sweetest waitress who I totally forgot her name but she was new and blonde and was so friendly! She was very speedy with our order and made sure we were satisfied costumers. I would give a 10/10 recommendation!!!"}
{"text":"The seafood was very good and tasted fresh.  The mixed drinks are yummy as well.  The customer service I received was on point.  No complaints here.   Will be returning"}
{"text":"My first time here and was very impressed definitely the best red lobster I've ever been to I ordered the Bal Harbor lobster bake and it was absolutely delicious!!!  I can't wait to go back again when I get my seafood craving I've tried other Italian restaurant seafood dishes and it just does not compare to this one try it you won't regret it!!!!!"}
{"text":"I've always thought red lobster had the most friendly waiters & best service of any other restaurant I've ever been to until last night, it was by far the worst restaurant experience that I've ever encountered. The waiter forgot every single thing that we ordered, even though he wrote it down... The drinks, which was just a  water & Dr. Pepper, the salad dressing, didn't put our soup order in, after we finally got our soup I had to find him to ask for soup spoons so that we could eat it, he forgot to put one of the main entree items in, so I received my food while my cousin had to wait so they could fix it before she received hers, then they forgot her side dishes. We had to wave the waiter down to request refills on our drinks every single time we needed refills. And on top of that he never once removed anything from our table, I literally had to move our salad bowls, soup bowls, bread baskets, & 4 glasses from our table to another table, that also hadn't been cleared. The waiter never asked us how our food was, never asked if we needed anything, I had to find him to ask him for more napkins, lemons, butter, crab forks, & crab crackers. After we requested to go containers we received one to go container, for all of our food, no bag. This was by far the worst experience I've ever had in a restaurant."}
{"text":"Our bartender Krystal, was surprisingly personable,  patient, helpful,  and bubbly.  The surprises continued throughout the crispy calamari with fried veggies,  and my favorite,  steamed snow crab legs.  I'm not one for chains, but then I have to remind myself that these type places have grown into chains because of their success."}
{"text":"Always great at this location!  Just got the broiled trio so I don't get too much fried food.  Waiter is amazing. We have two kids with us so we needed to order quickly and he took care of everything and got us out in 20 minutes. This place is great!  The only reason they're not getting five stars is because Red Lobster does tend to be a bit pricey for what you get."}
{"text":"My steak was overcooked. I ordered Medium and my mother in law ordered medium rare and they both were well done. They did not have snow crab. The food was bland. Never going there again  Had to ask 3 times for sugar and biscuits"}
{"text":"We're there this evening. Have never been to a place with that slow service. It took a wait staff to take our order about 30 minutes after we got seated and waited another 40 minutes for the food to come. We came at about 8.30 pm and there were not many people there and every single table around us was full of dirty dishes. Expected to have a good birthday dinner. Highly disappointed. Did not like service at all. Will not come again and will not recommend."}
{"text":"Sucks, no staff had to wait when there are 15 tables open. Server is nice and I'm better now.  Lol. Just don't understand why people have to wait when there are tables open. Manager said they were short on staff so I guess Customer have to suffer because of that."}
{"text":"I love to go to this restaurant when they have one of their national specials advertised, otherwise it's a bit too expensive for what you get.  The food is very tasty, altough I expect that they put a lot of salt in to make it so yummy.  The fact that there is also non-seafood items on the menu too like pasta and chicken means that everyone can find something they will enjoy."}
{"text":"Well this is the second year taking my son to Red Lobster for his birthday. Last year was awesome, amazing service and flat out incredible as our server bent over backwards to give us great service. This year it was just the three of us and quite honestly, after waiting 10 minutes to get water I was already irritated. No service, very busy yes but I had to get up and let the management know that we had been waiting for quite some time after being seated. They were busy and I get it but not cool in my opinion when you all want the all you can eat shrimp and you can't even get water lol!' We got no plates with our bread and used our napkins, had to ask for soda refill several times and only after complaining did we get some faster service.  Well they did sing happy birthday but no scoop of ice cream, no nothing. Kinda crap when last year they have us 3 deserts for 8 of us. Not looking for the freebies but c'mon guys, who doesn't give a birthday desert?!! Oh well, food was good and fresh and hot. Just not worth $75 for slow service without even getting a scoop of vanilla for the kid. Had to go to Bashes afterwards to get cake for pictures. Who has a birthday without desert?? Red Lobster, I will pass next time. You were nice enough but that 25cent scoop of birthday ice cream would have made all the difference. BTW- we tip good but won't be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Service was great. Came on Father's Day, restaurant was packed so we sat at the bar. Ordered a few appetizers: the mussels and the combination seafood appetizer with coconut shrimp, stuffed mushrooms and cocktail shrimp. Mussels were over done, and the coconut shrimp wasn't anything to brag about. But the biscuits were amazing as always and the stuffed mushrooms and cocktail shrimp were good. I'd be back."}
{"text":"Went to a Red Lobster in Orland Park recently and had a good expperience.  Other than the long wait, which was understandable for dinner on a Saturday night, the service was good.  The waiter got my order wrong but actually brought what I had in mind as a second choice.  So, no big deal.  The manager came and apologized profusely, comping my meal and then giving me several $5 gift certificates for the next visit.  Well, my next visit was right here in Champaign.  The staff was friendly and my server was sweet and helpful.  I splurged on lunch, getting the Seafood Stuffed Mushrooms for starters and the Lobsterfest Special that was lobster tails, shrimp, mussels, and scallops over linguine.  Other than the fact that one of the mussels was not open, the food was good.  No, I didn't eat it all there.  Had to get a take home box.  Then there are the biscuits.  Yum.  Always loved them.  When my kids were little and we went to Red Lobster, I would tell them to always say yes to more biscuits.  In those days, they kept refilling the little basket.  My kids (now adults) still remember that.  So, in all, this was a nice experience.  The seafood doesn't compare to the ultra-fresh stuff I ate back at Sheepshead Bay in my Brooklyn days (the fishing boats were literally across the street from the restaurants).  Places like Lundy's, Randazzo's, and Joe's Clam Bar were beyond words."}
{"text":"yummy is the only word i can say during my time?waiter is a hansome boy?explain everything carefully?hope i can go back again"}
{"text":"I just want to say we had such a great experience here tonight . We come to the Robinson location a-lot . With the new updated menu they no longer had the fish that I usually order .   I asked the waitress about it and they made it special for me .. It was excellent ! Parmesan crusted tilapia!!"}
{"text":"My husband and i came  last night and we had a great experience, our server Debbie was so sweet and explained everything .  I decided to get the ultimate feast . It has  lobster tail, steamed wild-caught North American snow crab legs, garlic shrimp scampi and  Shrimp. Served with rice. Wanted to try something other than salmon .When the platter came out , Debbie was nice  and asked  if I've ever had crab legs before , I mentioned no . She says \"let me get gloves and I'll show you \".  That for me was a great gesture and it was good to see how to do it . I was able to eat my dinner like a pro thanks to her . I am thankful that she went out of her way to make my night a great one .  Her customer service was exceptional!   At the end she even mentioned about the app and I am happy she did . I was able to get rewards already ."}
{"text":"So RL is still using large plates for shrinking food portions. Hehe   Seriously, the food is still good and you still get your RL fix despite the price increase and food decrease. The good news is that they haven't changed much in other areas. The biscuits are still the same, as are the salads and the staff is still very friendly. Just drink, be merry & enjoy! :)))"}
{"text":"Haven't been to Red Lobster for over a year cuz last time we went the food was quite disappointing, but today was very good. This time we went for lunch, not as busy as dinner time, so maybe that's why the food was way better. As usual we loveeee their biscuits, they are so fluffy and warm mmm yum. They have now this special for only $18 and it comes with a soup, a salad, an entree (not moo many choices though) and a dessert, can't go wrong for the price. We also ordered another entree but that was not listed on the special :(, can't remember the name but it comes with 2 lobster tails, 2 types of shrimps, rice and broccoli, it was sooooo good. Also ordered an appetizer (called something like coconut island shrimps) but that we didn't really like, it was kind of sweet, not our taste for appetizers. Services was good, the only thing we didn't like was that she took a little long to bring us the drinks, but overall was good."}
{"text":"Delicious...crab legs....my favorite...wait staff was terrific too... gonna get a big tip...thanks Holly!!"}
{"text":"Love it so much. Service is quite good and the lobster is fantastic. We have tried twice a week. Many people have birthday celebration here. Very nice place to choose."}
{"text":"I thought this red lobster was great! We had a party of 9 and we were sat within 15min on a busy Saturday night. The host was good and the place was clean. Our server Almonte had excellent customer service! There were a lot of things on the menu and the prices were reasonable. I would definitely recommend this place if you are in the area. Unfortunately we probably won't be back for awhile since we are visiting from Hawaii:("}
{"text":"REVIEW WRITTEN BY SOMEONE WHO MADE THIER LIVINF FISHING, I CAUGHT MY OWN SHRIMP!  I had their shrimp feast.  So sad, the shrimp are small, bait shrimp were I came from, to dry landers, medium frozen shrimp.  It was all water soaked, mushy and without flavor.  It is so sad, I have found very little good there, other then the live lobster, BUT, my standards are very very high.  In THIER defense,  I am in the desert, and Red Lobster is not a gourmet restaurant, I am being hard on them.  The wait staff was great, everything else I I joyed very much."}
{"text":"Well I guess this is another place that doesn't feel the need to be cordial to people with to go orders. The girl on the phone was rushing me. The bartender had an attitude. He asked my name and I gave it to him and confirmed my order. He then sighed and said YEAH THATS WHAT IT IS. No eye contact! The nicest person was the guy who greeted me at the door! Then this so called lobster salad has such a small amount of meat I think I have more croutons than lobster! Ridiculous! I'll stick to the Gilbert location!"}
{"text":"Red Lobster is Red Lobster. But this place was pretty nice. My friend and I were on our way to Yorkdale when we saw this on the side of the road and thought to stop in since we wanted something deep fried and seafood that wasn't fish & chips.   After chowing down on the cheddar bay biscuits... We both went with a \"pick-your-own\" creation with island coconut shrimp, shrimp linguinne and a side and the two of us could just barely finish our meals in its entirety. (Both young 20's, around 5 feet females.. tiny but we eat a lot!)  Overall, our server made us feel at home and the meal was pleasant. Atmosphere was cozy and lights were dim. Would visit again!"}
{"text":"Our server was Haniel. She didn't seem to be very friendly. We were indirectly told there was no more salmon. She said she would check to confirm. We were going to get that. We needed more time to decide but she came back in less than a minute. When i told her i wasn't ready, she asked \"do you want me to come back?\" No,  I'll email my order in....She got the hint but stayed away for a while.   She finally came back and took the order. She did bring refills without request. That was nice. Our food came. It was good. Our server checked on us enough."}
{"text":"Love Red Lobster. Everything was delicious. The lobster crab and shrimp were  perfect. Pricey but worth it"}
{"text":"I loved EVERYTHING at this place! Went on a Sat night around 7:30 and didn't even wait 5 minutes for a table. Our waitress Jewels was just the best! She was very attentive and very sweet. Then they had the most delicious peach lemonade I have ever tasted along with those cheesy rolls! This was my first time there and all I could ever remember is people telling me even if you don't like seafood you gotta go for the rolls. Well, they were right on! We ate a whole basket and Jewels even gave us some to take home. My entree was a sirloin smothered with blue cheese sauce on top and mashed potatoes with green beans. It was so good, but I was so full of endless amounts of peach lemonade, cheesy rolls and Caesar salad that I couldn't finish it all. It made for a great lunch the next day :) Anyway, next time you go, request Jewels if she's there even though all the staff seemed on target with great service."}
{"text":"Red Lobster is a guilty pleasure of mine. It is nothing special when compared to other seafood restaurants but they clearly get the job done. On the weekends,  the location on the east side is totally packed with a significant wait. Prices are competitive for seafood depending on what you order, but, quality may be questionable as you get what you pay for.  The menus for lunch and dinner are different with the exception of some elements remaining static. Menu variation may occur due to what seafood is in season, aka crab fest or lobster fest. Most dishes are served with some soup or salad. After you order, you will be served fresh, hot and amazing, cheddar bay bay biscuits. Generally speaking, I try to stick to french fries or steamed vegetables as my side as it seems as others, like the premium mashed potatoes, still taste like they were out of a box.  Service is just fine most of the time, prompt and appropriate. Wait staff know the menu well and seem to be willing to help make subtitistions based on patron preferences. Drink options are decent with a couple of unique cocktails.  Overall a good place to eat with decent food, drink, and service."}
{"text":"I like Red Lobster more and more as I have opened myself up to seafood.  I enjoy my experiences, although I always seem to expect a little more. The appetizers and bread are usually excellent, while the entrees are just OK. The service could be better, but I enjoy the cozy atmosphere. The biggest issue is that it's way too expensive. So while it's not bad, I can get a better meal elsewhere for cheaper."}
{"text":"For the price I paid the food portions were more than adequate. I left with a to-go box filled with leftovers.  We were seated immediately, but unfortunately we were put into the same corner of the restaurant as everyone else and had 3 very unhappy young children sitting near us, one of which was having a birthday party. I suppose this could be because we went later in the evening when they were trying to clean up the other part of the restaurant.  The service was agreeable, our waiter was very friendly, knowledgeable of the menu, and was prompt on drink refills. We did have to ask for some delicious Cheddar Biscuits though.  The quality of the food was acceptable, but for the price I paid I would've expected better. Then again trying to get \"good\" seafood in central Illinois is a bit of a joke.  All aspects considered: it was an enjoyable evening out with friends, and I left satisfied."}
{"text":"The Ultimate feast was truly amazing. It was delicious and I basically ate the entire thing haha. My stomach is beyond full but it was worth it. My friend had the beer battered fish and chips and she said it was delicious. It looked really yummy. We had cheese sticks to start and they were pretty good as well!"}
{"text":"I frequent here often and they never fail me.  The staff is always friendly and efficient. The food is always fresh and tasty."}
{"text":"Honestly, I am not a big fan of Red Lobster, but my man is so he's taken me a few times. I will not be going back. I believe their customer service is poor, the facility is dirty, and it takes forever to even just get a refill. I am done sorry Red Lobster..."}
{"text":"We called in advance to ensure the restaurant could accommodate a large group at 6:30PM. My husband called in the early afternoon and was told that we would be okay as long as we called 30 minutes prior so they can ensure they would have a table ready by 6:30PM.  My husband called 45min in advance to confirm. We arrived at 6PM and was told by the hostess that they are working on getting our table ready. We checked on our table several times, and were told that they were just waiting on another party to finish up. Our whole party was present and we weren't seated until after 8PM and  while waiting left with absolutely no seating with 5 children including two infants.  The manager did apologize and offered us three appetizers on the house which was nice. We all ordered our food, and it took over an hour to come out- COLD! The shrimp wasn't cooked through, and the broccoli for our infants was not cooked either. We addressed several complaints to the manager on staff as well as the servers.   We were assigned two servers, one of which wasn't present 80% of the time leaving us without refills on drinks. We even asked the other server if she had left for the day. We did not leave this location to nearly 11PM and if anyone who has young children, this is probably the most stressful time when they are on a routine schedule. We even had to put our youngest in pajamas and put her to sleep in her carseat because it was so late.  This could have all been avoided had the table been ready at the promised time!!!! We understand that things like this do happen occasionally but we should have been told UP FRONT that we more than likely will not be able to have a table ready at that time. We wouldn't have been as upset if the food came out as what we would have expected for the 'Red Lobster standard.' This was my husbands birthday, and it was ruined. We had plans following this meal that had to be cancelled due to the timing issues with this restaurant. We have been accommodated at other restaurants such as olive garden with even BIGGER parties and had absolutely no issues.  We are extremely disappointed in the food as well as service.  A table should NOT BE PROMISED if it cannot be accommodated.  Had we known this, we would have went somewhere else. We will NOT recommend this restaurant chain for ANYONE who needs a large party accommodated going forward."}
{"text":"It's been at least 10 years since I last ate at Red Lobster, so one spontaneous day last June, I decided to give it another shot. Service was exceptional, however food that day was pretty horrid. I was very hyped up about this restaurant from passing by it on weekends when it was extremely packed - so much so that it was a 45 minute wait! I returned on a weeknight to beat the rush, and sadly, it may be another 10 years before I visit again.   I was tempted by their menus to try the 4-course Seafood Feast for $17.99 special which I thought was a steal. Apparently not, because their food was mediocre and any other generic restaurant could've easily surpassed this. Just because it's a \"special\" doesn't mean it has to be terrible. I rather have less food and it be fantastic than full but it was crappy junk. Fantastic service though, our server was friendly, helpful, and was pretty chirpy.   We started with the soups/salads - they tasted alright. Nothing special, a little bit on the saltier side, but no big complaints here. My WTF moment came when I was served my entree - the Garlic Alfredo Shrimp-and-Scallop Pasta. For me, this is a pretty generic dish that is hard to eff up. Guess what? They effed it up. Either a rookie chef cooked my meal, or the quality of food here is not up to par because the spaghetti was extremely sticky and chewy - it would literally clump together in a ball. It felt like chomping on gnocchi because the pasta dough was so tough and nasty... Sauce was not memorable and tasted like a brand from the supermarket. Seafood was small and disappointing.  My family ordered the Jumbo Coconut and Pineapple-Grilled Shrimp. Looks better in the picture and sounds better than it tasted - I was a little underwhelmed when it came, 'cause I thought their seafood tasted average for a place that boasts about well... their seafood. I was very confused.   If that wasn't enough, we chose onion rings as our side and they came barely warm and BURNT - like our teeth hurt from crunching on it and there was a slight burnt aftertaste. Come on now - this is like basic deep frying 101. I ended my meal with a key lime pie thinking it would be light and refreshing, but it ended up being one of those overly sweet tarts you get at bakeries. It ain't strawberry shortcake, it's a key lime pie! I brought it home hoping to eat it, but ended up throwing it out without touching it again.  Good service but poor food = not likely to come back."}
{"text":"Ok first of all our waiter Peter was one of the best servers We have ever had, he answered all questions was there for refills and treated us like family one of our party did not like her soup and he got us a different one cheddar biscuits were refilled as need without asking This was a perfect meal, now some may ask  perfect meal why Only 4 stars?  Well if it was only for Peter I would have given him 10 stars but this is for the whole restaurant. The hostess who seated us was asked about the menu and she said I am the hostess I don't look at the menu and don't know what is on it  Not good other then that make it 4.5 stars"}
{"text":"I love this place. The staff is always friendly and making sure everything is ok. I come here alot for their shrimp dip. They hs be many items in the menu that are just delicious"}
{"text":"I'm seeing a lot of salt in these reviews, and it has nothing to do with the bucketfuls the staff put into the entrees.  In a word - the Bay/Dundas Red Lobster location is fantastic.  I've spoken about my fondness for Red Lobster before. The Burnhamthorpe/Wolfedale Road location in Mississauga has been a yearly visit for my group of friends and I, and we've created plenty of stories about our exploits/eating contests there. I was planning to get out there this year, but work and our group's lack of availability put a damper on the whole thing... or so it would seem.  On a recent trek into the city this past weekend, three friends and I were planning on hitting up Uncle Tatsu's for that delicious MSG cheesecake bomb. Yet, when we saw this RL across the street, we knew it was destined to be. With only an hour-and-a-half to spare until the kitchen closed, we came up with a quick battle plan - order as much of the Endless Shrimp as possible, stick to our limits and get out without bloating our waistlines.  On one hand, I thought of the nature of less-fortunate residents in the city who go around trying to survive day-to-day (including a spirited young man who ran up to me screaming for help that he was hungry while I was walking through Koreatown earlier that evening). On the other, when the staff are happy to serve you two, three or four servings of shrimp on the same plate AT ONCE, and they tell you that it's all going to be thrown out otherwise, you'd better believe I'll be on that like Fat Albert.  Our table soon filled up with a couple servings of shrimp linguine packed onto one plate, four different types of shrimp (including popcorn shrimp, which wasn't listed on the menu - I don't know what other reviewers are talking about when they say there are no other options) and more cheese biscuits than you could shake a stick at. We knew going in that the Endless Shrimp promotion was going to be our game, and three of us each carved through a good 50-60 shrimp each. My other friend went for the coconut shrimp dish, which she enjoyed but insisted on taking the majority home as leftovers.  The reason why this location gets a solid 5 stars is because of the service. Our waitress (a U of T student who works there on the weekends) was basically telling us to order as much stuff as we could. I didn't think the service could be any better than the Burnhamthorpe location, but when she not only brought out a stack(!) of takeout containers but two bags full of fresh biscuits, that's when I knew I'd died and gone to salt heaven. It's three days later (as of this writing) and I still have half-a-bag of biscuits to work through.  This may not be the most inspired dining choice in Toronto, but it doesn't need to be. It's fantastic at what it does, and the location is nicely modern and easy to lounge in.  Well worth a visit, and the Atrium (the mall this location is connected to) is worth a look as well."}
{"text":"OH GOD WE DID IT AGAIN  Yes, we went back for Endless Shrimp, and once again, the experience was amazing. We all took away enough leftovers to feed a small European village.  Luckily I kept my appetite in check, but my friends ate so much that we had to walk over to Square One and back just to burn off some of the calories. The peppercorn shrimp with the dipping sauce is a particular highlight, and it's a new menu item.  If all the sodium doesn't get me, I'll be back again."}
{"text":"Well I came here alone (surprisingly) to let my house cool off after getting my air conditioner fixed finally.  I entered about 1pm and asked for a window seat and she sat me near the window.  It was pretty quiet and not too many people but that was fine with me.    Couldn't wait to sit down and get those biscuits and boy were they good.  I ordered an Ultimate Feast however what I ordered definitely defeated me because I only at 15% cuz I was really full off of the bread, salad, and margarita.    The food took a little while to come out but that's ok I wasn't in a rush just figured they had to prepare my food.  The margarita I ordered tasted ok but it had wayyyyy too much ice so I didn't get much alcohol at all.  Next time I will order it to be blended.    Nice experience since it was probably my very first time dining alone and it was pleasantly peaceful and quiet just like I like it."}
{"text":"i took my little cousin here for his birthday yesterday 06/29/2015 and i was greeted immediately as i had to wait for him to show up.  well just as everyone else knows that biscuits are delish!!! although when we ate the 4 biscuits they gave us we weren't immediately offered more biscuits.  but we got our fill anyway and took some home.  the prices are just a bit more expensive that what i'm used to but let me tell you the ultimate feast is everything.....i really mean an ultimate feast!!! the crab legs were huge, lobster tail was huge, baked potato with all the fixings, fries were good and hot, and both kinds of shrimp were good.  i didn't get to eat it all since i had the salad and bread before we ate but it was just as good when i re-heated my leftovers.  service when we got to the table was ok just hate i have to ask for water more than once.  i am a water drinker and need my thirst quenched.  needless to say we had a great time and will definitely be going back again!!!"}
{"text":"We went to RL for lunch today.  They still have the shrimp tacos that I raved about but this time I tried one of the lunch catches.  I just want to send a shout out about the portion sizes.  I ordered the wood grilled shrimp and chicken.  The chicken breast was about the size of a chicken tender - very thin and small.  The shrimp and potato were small too.  The potato was about the size of my fist and the shrimps about an inch big.  The flavor was wonderful.  Everything tasted really good and although it sounds like I am complaining about the size I am really not because that was all I needed to eat for lunch anyway.  I just wanted others to know the scaled down size so they don't leave hungry.  It was only 8.79 so the price is scaled down as well."}
{"text":"This is a typical chain restaurant...  The crab appetizer that I order didn't tasted fresh, but  I appreciate that they let us pick another one. The service was great with decent food."}
{"text":"Very disapoointed in lobster dish ordered with what seemed like fake lobster. False advertising led to disappointment in food"}
{"text":"Went with a large party and was very pleased at how well the staff did. They were very attentive and were even able to spilt the check (12 people) without confusion. They also allowed us to tip based on our service rather than the number of people in our party. The food was as good as expected for Red Lobster."}
{"text":"I figured that I would give RL one more try...can someone say NEVER AGAIN!!!! The Lobster was tough. Matter of fact everything was gross. The waitress gave me some lame a** excuse why the lobster was tough. She forgot our appetizer. She kept forgetting of our requested items. The floor was nasty and the lobby smelled like urine. Do Not mop the lobby with the bathroom mop. My advice is they need to close all the Red Lobsters. So Sad..."}
{"text":"First off, the waiter we had was hands down one of the best servers I've ever had! We were seated fairly quickly and the food was good, pretty much on par with your average Red Lobster. The restaraunt could have been a little cleaner, which is why it gets 4 stars instead of 5."}
{"text":"Red Lobster's service wasn't as good as before. Last time I went it took a while to get our drinks( not cocktails, just pops) and the portions aren't as big. I tried the captain's catch lunch special( garlic shrimp, fried shrimp, and filet) shrimp was good but portions could be better."}
{"text":"I love seafood and I love this place. I've been coming to this location for over 20 years. I always come for my birthday (in January) and once more in the summer. Its funny now a the staff that haven't turned over remember me and know what I'm going to order. Once in a while I will change it up but my fav is the Ultimate Meal (has a bit of everything).  The service here is amazing, they are really polite and fast with the drinks/refills and refilling those amazing garlic cheese biscuits. I would highly recommend everyone try it out at least once.   Best times to go if the summer menu (Lobsterfeast or All you can eat shrimp).  Even if you dont like seafood there are some chicken and steak options.  Everything from the appitizers, soups, mains and dessart are all flavourful, great portions and never disappointing."}
{"text":"Weight staff were a little slow during lunch time. Food was great though and I will kill for those biscuits!"}
{"text":"Perfectly fine if you just want a casual seafood dinner, the fish is good, it is red lobster and you are going to get basic seafood done well.  Don't expect anything too haute and you won't be disappointed.  Shrimp fest is the best reason to go."}
{"text":"I know you go to Red Lobster for the Seafood, but I don't care for Seafood, however tonight my wife and I went because she loves crab legs - so I took one for the team. I had Shrimp Cocktail and it was meh - I guess I'm use to higher end restaurants where they give you something more than plain old cocktail sauce that was barely a step above ketchup. I then ordered a house salad for my entree (and my wife's meal came with one too). That salad has got to be THE WORST SALAD I HAVE EVER EATEN IN A RESTAURANT IN MY LIFE. It was a notch below the pre-bagged iceberg salad you could buy at one of the Big Lots with the groceries that are about to expire. I mean, it was gross. The tomatoes were sour. The dressing was that cheap Kraft dressing that doesn't even need to be refrigerated like you would get at the gas station. I could go on and on... The waitress and staff was all nice. I do however wish she would have noticed how we both barely ate any salad, especially mine since it was my dinner. A waitress shouldn't wait for the customer to complain, she should have noticed and immediately offered to do something. We won't be going back to Red Lobster any time soon, and if it's up to me not at all.   Hopefully this review helps anyone who likes how salad tastes."}
{"text":"Good service at this place, first spot we ate at when we arrived on our first night and our last as well.   Food is of course specialised in lobster and other shellfish, the clam chowder was rather delicious and rivals that I had in San Francisco's Fisherman's Wharf. Lobster was tender too and the prawns (shrimp) juicy and plump.   One thing is the food can be a bit salty - we found this to be generic of Torontonian food though so not sure if it's just us foreigners lol  Special shoutouts to Mark and Robert who served us both times who were friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"My wife and I were craving seafood at a reasonable price. Given the poor reviews we decided to give this place a shot. Hostess seated us promptly with a smile.  Our waiter Solomon was attentive, courteous, and fun. Every staff member onsite was great. My wife's crab legs were cooked perfect. Calamari appetizer was good, and my lobster tacos were great. Thanks for a very good dinner."}
{"text":"My husband & I just finished an EXCELLENT lunch at Red Lobster. I had Shrimp Tacos with Caesar Salad & hubby had Tilapia. All was well prepared and served. Our waitress, Lucy, was personable and prompt. Would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I am sitting in the restaurant as I write this review, I have to say, the bartender here is like a robot.  No personality what so ever.  The girl tried to chat with us a little and was scolded by the guy for not listening to her radio.  So I wonder what happened to customer service.  She is very nice and wanted to make sure we had a good experience but Kevin wasn't going to let that happen.  I wish her luck and hope that she finds a way to let her personality show through to her customers despite the hostile environment.  I'm sorry I didn't catch her name I would ask for her if I were to ever come back.  The food was edible.  Nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"This Red Lobster rarely has a very long wait even on the weekends. We've been a few times & the meal is just as good as you'd expect fro the Red Lobster. The staff was helpful, courteous & knowledgeable of their specials & deals. My only wish is that the barkeeps weren't so stingy on the alcohol in the cocktails but hey what are you gonna do?"}
{"text":"Never again coming to this overrated places . I got a fish it's was cold and tasted horrible. Not to mention the price for it. Places like this just brings in people because of the name not because of the food. U order a 20 meal and get three or four shrimps on the side and then to find out there cold forget it I rather go to Petes fish and chips. When u order a 20 $ plate u want a wow that is amazing not some half worked throw it in the plate. I don't know about u but I expect an awesome meal now I can compromise if I had paid 5 bucks for the plate then I would not be complaining. Horrible  horrible over priced never coming again."}
{"text":"Ordered coconut shrimp, crab legs, mojito, pint of beer. Everything was very tasty, mojito seemed diluted and not much mint (I prefer more mint in my mojito). My snow crabs were to come with potatoes and corn, but sadly didn't. My friend had ordered crab legs as well and did not want her potatoes and corn so I grabbed them from her.   Service was good, but the server kept asking my sober friend if she were drunk and heading to a party, which was a bit odd/rude."}
{"text":"It's what you expect from a red lobster. My husband is obsessed with the endless shrimp, so we go once a year for it. We got there at about 6pm on a friday night and was told the wait was 15-20 minutes. not bad! We got the buzzer and went to the bar and got some drinks while we waited. The 2 girls at the bar were very attentive and friendly. At exactly 15 minutes, our buzzer went off and we were seated.  Initially our waitress was very present, but after we ordered our food, and my husband ordered another drink she was nowhere to be found. Our food was delivered and my husband asked about the drink, which she then immediately brought, but it was watered down. Telling us the bar had made it probably 10 minutes prior and she had forgotten about it.  Our food was good for what it is, but tracking down our waitress wasnt easy at all. It was busy, but I kept seeing all of the other waiters for our section just not ours."}
{"text":"First time at red lobster and here for the all you can eat shrimp ! Not gonna lie, the biscuits were fricken delicious. Anyways, going back on point, the wait was about 20-30 minutes, not bad as to other places. I was pretty hungry and so was my friends, so the orders got in quick and food started coming out.   First plate was the Alfredo, gotta get the Alfredo man, and soy-wasabi grilled shrimp. Alfredo was tasty, but it was a bit too thick on the sauce. Felt like it kind of overwhelmed my whole mouth. Overall, not bad not bad. Only got two plates of this, one in the beginning and one to end. Can't fill up stomach room with carbs !  Soy-wasabi and shrimp scambis are the go-to dishes for the best benefits of maximum shrimp consumption. Ask for no rice on the wasabi grilled shrimp plate, it'll just come out shrimp. Perfect? Yeah. It was the tastiest of all shrimp dishes too. Scambi was not bad, bit too buttery for my liking. The hand-breaded shrimp wasn't bad too. Got tired of eating it though. We kept getting orders for it because the waitress kept mistaking our table. Nevertheless, still shrimp. I wish I ate more though, but the cheddar biscuits got me bloated and gassy.. Too much information.. But it was uncomfortable :l.   Our waitress was nice! She kept asking us what we wanted next and kept bringing them in a fast paced manner. She told us the top seat of most shrimp eaten is 32 plates. Maybe I'll come back and try to take the crown ! Oh and our party discovered that our friend has a minor shrimp intolerance for the first time after eating a truckload of shrimp. Not really a pretty sight to see, but hilarious yes."}
{"text":"Overall each of my experiences at this particular Red Lobster have been okay.  The restaurant itself is clean. The bathrooms are kept up.  The service can be dicey. We went two times recently very close to each other.   The first time the service was pretty bad. I kept asking for our free cheddar biscuits and our waiter kept telling us they were making more and he would bring some out as soon as he could, despite the fact that other tables around us were receiving them. I finally stopped a manager and asked for them and we received the biscuits right away. I don't know if it was the waiters ploy to get us to order more items we would pay for but it was not successful. What he did succeed in doing was lowering his tip. Foolish waiter, he did not know I waited tables for 10 years and always way over tip for even adequate service. At any rate the rest of the meal was fine. I almost always enjoy the food there.   The second time we went we had excellent service. Our waitress was prompt with both the yummy biscuits and drink refills. I did, however have a complaint with the food. We ordered the potato battered shrimp and never have I eaten anything so salty in my entire life. My husband & I each took one bite and had to send them back, requesting something else instead. The waitress handled this beautifully, it was the manager, in this case, that didn't. The manager didn't even do a table visit. I also was in restaurant management for 15 years and I know the first thing you do when you have a customer complaint is GO VISIT THE TABLE! Instead we could see her rolling her eyes when the server brought this to her attention. She made the server come back to the table and collect the shrimps in question. The server did replace our shrimps with something else we did like and did so quickly. The rest of the meal was fine.   So yeah, overall it was fine. A couple of problems each time but always resolved quickly except for the lack of concern on the part of the manager. A good place to go and get some yummy food."}
{"text":"I love this place, everytime I've been there the food was cooked to the point, the drinks are amazing and the price is fair for what it is. Buying lobster at St lawrence's is more expensive and it comes uncooked"}
{"text":"The service was 5 star but the food deserves a 3 star.  We orders chilli shrimp and lobster dip for appetizer. The lobster dip was extremely salty and the chips were covered in thick layers of salt.  The starter salad that came before the entree was awful. Tasted very bland.  The entree was delicious. It was cooked perfectly paired with the right amount of sauces."}
{"text":"I love Red Lobster, and I eat here frequently, but we ate here for Crab fest, and the size of the crab cakes was RIDICULOUS!!  They were so tiny, they would have been wise to combine the two of them into one acceptable sized one.  They were delicious, but way too tiny.  I am seldom disappointed in Red Lobster, but I truly was after that dinner."}
{"text":"They have gotten a lot better over the years. Good service and food was great! Very pricey from what I remember a few years ago so won't go here much."}
{"text":"This went from our favorite place to eat to never eating there again. We got the lobster mac and cheese which was $25 ( with barely any lobster in it) and it was so fishy tasting that I thought it was rotten. We each took a bite and threw it all in the trash ( take out order). This was second time in a month that our dinners went straight in the trash. I highly recommend that you do yourself a favor and pick someplace else to eat."}
{"text":"We went to this location at around 7pm last night and we've been here before with no issues but this time it was terrible. My boyfriend ordered the all you can eat shrimp and I had one of the trio dinners. Although our server Erik seemed knowledgeable and was very approachable in the beginning, he quickly turned into a jerk by using inappropriate comments towards my boyfriend. With the all you can eat shrimp, you can pick from a list of shrimp and taste as much as you want. Our server came over to us and asked if he should put in 2 orders for my boyfriend to \"keep up with him\". This bothered me more than him as it seemed discriminatory towards my boyfriend as we aren't the smallest people. At the end, Erik approached us with the check without even asking us if we wanted to dessert or more drinks and when my boyfriend went to order dessert for me, Erik came back with a comment such as \"oh wow really? I thought the all you can eat would be one and done\" insinuating we should be too full to even want dessert. When my boyfriend confronted him he shied away with a pathetic apology and didn't look back. We didn't appreciate the snide comments about how or what we were eating because it's non of his business. His job is to get us anything we want without judgement, commentary, or hesitation. Needless to say he did not get a tip and we will no longer frequent this restaurant."}
{"text":"I wouldn't eat here if you paid me to. However, a few of my friends (*cough *cough Mark J) put on their top hats, tuxes and tails to endure the faux fanciness that is Le Red Lobster. I came along strictly to document the experience.   I must confess that as a child my parents dragged me to Le Lobster Rouge all the time, even though the food gave me VIOLENT EXPLOSIVE DIARRHEA every time. I still shudder at the thought of eating anything from here and refused to eat.   So I ordered a diet coke and a plate of maraschino cherries...because I'm a classy lady after all.   Speaking of class, Red Lobster is one of those places trashy people go because they think eating shrimp makes you classy. Apparently eating endless shrimp makes you infinitely classy - because there were some real winners dining here tonight.   But I'm not here to help the patrons, just the restaurant, so I digress.  The service was odd. The waitress was friendly enough and she seriously brought me a plate of cherries - for realz!. That made me love her endlessly, like shrimp. I also loved the speedy refills and the pleasant way she reacted to a hateful Lobster cynic maniac who only orders a plate of garnish from the bar. So waitress = awesome.  Other than that, Red Lobster is pretty much the nastiest place on earth. It wasn't particularly dirty or gross or anything. It just wreaks of nast.  Like even the cleanest and friendliest strip club is still just a dirty little shack filled with glitter, STD's, bad boob jobs, boners. A layer of filth. Just filled with nast.  So my friend's food came and it looked edible, but not good. They ate it, but I'm not sure they liked it. So I guess we were on the same page.  Then the kid next to us started bopping around like a lollipop kid and the lady in the huge purple muu muu ate her 5th cheese biscuit  and I drank my 5th diet coke and shit got weird after that.  When we got the bill I felt a little like I ate acid, but came back down to earth when I realized the dope ass waitress didn't charge me for my diet coke. Or the cherries. Score!  So my experience at Red Lobster was good. I just couldn't eat the food.   Oh... when I got home and peered in my purse I found someone stuffed it with like 50 packets of Splenda and the crab cracking tool thing. Thanks a**holes. Nice joke.  Classy evening all around."}
{"text":"I haven't had Red Lobster in years, maybe since undergrad, that was over 10 years ago.  I hardly ever see commercials for Red Lobster so I always miss the deals.  A co-worker of mine advocated heavily for Red Lobster all you can eat shrimp deal. He said, \"Trust me ... it's not the same endless shrimp deal you had years ago\".  So I tried it.  We (3 of us) went to Red Lobster this past Sunday.  We originally went to the restaurant in Gilbert, the wait for a party of 3 was 30 - 40 minutes.    My boyfriend called Red Lobster in Chandler, the wait was 15 minutes.  Since it was only a 15-minute drive, we decided to go with that one.  The minute we arrived we were seated. Our server was Natasha.  She was AMAZING.  SO attentive, patient and quick.  Natasha kept the biscuits coming, the waters and strawberry lemonades coming and of course the shrimp.  Like always, or at least like I remembered, I got super full on 2 biscuits and my house salad before my shrimp and baked potato came out so my endless shrimp experience was cut short.    My first go round I ordered the Mediterranean Shrimp and the Nashville Hot shrimp.  Man, they were sooooo tasty.  The presentation though ... pretty lame.  The Nashville Hot shrimp looked exactly like the regular fried shrimp except the breading wasn't crispy, it was soggy but the flavor was awesome.  It looked NOTHING like the commercials.  Same with the Mediterranean Shrimp, again taste amazing but the presentation ... thumps down.  My second go round I ordered the shrimp scampi and another order of Nashville Hot.  My boyfriend ordered the regular fried shrimp and shrimp scampi the first time.  The second time around he ordered shrimp scampi again and Nashville Hot.  They really were a hit!  My boyfriend's son stuck with chicken tenders. 3 biscuits in he had a food coma lol ... Natasha noticed, asked if we needed anything and how could she help.  That was sweet.  Overall this was a really good dinner and I'll definitely visit this location again for endless shrimp."}
{"text":"I love the new poke item! It's only 6$ so I expected it to be small but honestly if you go anywhere else it's the same amount of poke but for like 12 bucks so I was pleasantly surprised! My food was good too. The waitress wasn't necessarily rude but you could tell she didn't wanna be there and didn't have a great attitude, but I'm still giving 4 stars because besides her every other time I've come everyone's been so nice!"}
{"text":"Sat relatively quickly. Got drinks relatively quickly. Even got an app relatively quickly....without silverware. Then it went downhill. Our drinks were NEVER refilled. Took us 45 minutes to get our entrees (and our utensils for the appetizer......which means we ate cold apps with our entree). Our airhead waitress didn't do a damn thing for us. She was hanging out at the hostess area yucking it up with the other young girls...no doubt talking about how dumb all these customers are.  The busboy was loud and obnoxious and I watched him clean the table next to us by taking his arm and pulling everything toward him across the table. No solvent, no rag....... Whoever manages this place can suck it."}
{"text":"Just real bad service. Server-Annie was unhelpful, didn't listen and overall created a bad experience. I'm pretty forgiving bc people can be busy, work long hours, and whatever else but she just stuck out, not in a good way. Not sure I'll return to this location"}
{"text":"I give this location a solid 3 stars our server Megan did such an exception job. We arrived before noon during the week and it wasn't very busy so we were seated immediately. We chose the wood- fired grilled shrimp tacos and the wood-fired grilled shrimp salad two iced teas and a cup of chowder all for about $22 thats a real lunch time bargain.   The (3) tacos were served on soft flour tortillas with just enough jalapeño mayo, plenty of plump wood-fried grilled shrimp topped with chopped cabbage in moderation, cilantro and a nice salsa. Excellent choice for $7.99 and plenty of food.  The wood-fired shrimp salad / clam chowder combination was excellent as well nice amount of wood-fired grilled shrimp topped the ice cold iceberg lettuce, tomatoes, cucumber, carrot, red onion, croutons and your choice of dressing served with a cup of hot clam chowder $7.99  I will continue coming here."}
{"text":"Was craving for seafood and this suddenly came to mind. I haven't been here for many years. After so long, I had a pleasant experience tonight.   My friend and I both ordered the \"Seaport lobster and shrimp\" meal and it was delish. They gave us complimentary tea biscuit which was super fluffy and full of garlic butter flavour. The meal itself came with a salad either garden or ceasar and also a choice of side which includes broccoli, mash potato, baked potato, and fries (they actually have more but I forget) of your choice. It was a good portion because we thought we wouldn't be full but after everything, we were stuffed!  Our server was friendly and attentive. Will definitely be back more often."}
{"text":"Typically when you go to a sea food restaurant you order a sea food platter. But I don't like sea food too much so I ordered a chicken dish. Maybe...no, definitely avoid their chicken. I highly doubt they are serving fresh chicken. It had a really weird texture, I can't explain it but trust me it was not quality. Plus it was the thinnest cut, half if it fatty and the bottom of it was over cooked so over all I had four bites worth at most.   My daughter really enjoyed the crab legs and her broccoli, she didn't touch her Mac and cheese. My fiancé and my sister really liked their crab legs and lobster. FOR ME, the best part of dinning at this Red Lobster was their garlic biscuits, I love those tastey little rolls. The host was really nice, we were seated quickly, we were helped by a server (Linda) right away and she was very sweet. The food came out in good time as well and our drinks were refilled without having to ask.   BIG FAT NEGATIVE... There were two flies hanging around our table, landing on the sides of our glasses and attempting to rest on our platted food. When I looked over at the big windows there  was a few more flies hanging out on them. Very unappetizing to see. And honestly it made me wonder what their kitchen might be like....maybe I watch too many of those 'restaurant rescue' shows."}
{"text":"Aight so we usually do the unlimited skrimp special once a year.. last year sucked ass for us but this visit was amazing. At first we were skeptic because they brought the wrong shrimp out at first but.. it's unlimited so who cares. Their old policy was too .ake us wait for fucking ever and fill us up on water and biscuits.. but this time.. EVA did a good ass job. She was on top of her game.. getting us refills back to back. Water... all the shrimp we ordered came out quick. Good ass service. Thanks Eva! Oh and ps Eva if you're reading this my gf DID want the tarter sauce for her order thanks!!!"}
{"text":"2.5 stars Food-ok, $$/4 pricewise, service-ok slow because they are always busy, typical red lobster decor marine folksy  Problem is they are way too busy and can't turn the table around fast enough. Often frequented by big groups celebrating a bday or some other social occasion. Cheap lobster will do that. Upscale dining when you have kids.   Why the poor rating service was poor and the wait is way too long for what this is.   Had the lobster pizza-good delish, Maine lobster bake-ok -too much potatoes and corn filler, snow crab- way too much work with so little crab meat reward, wild sockeye salmon- sort of bland for sockeye salmon. Really like the veggie sides.   Would recommend for birthdays special occasion celebration but for dinner out with kids when you don't want to cook,  it's just too long of a wait."}
{"text":"I feel like Red Lobster has gone down over the last several years. The prices have increased over time, but the quality of the food seems to have gone down. I feel like the food is generally very average; however, the service is always great! It's just hit or miss, but I wouldn't not go back."}
{"text":"Beware of false info in their menus!!   Five of the eight menus we received at our table had different prices for their Four course meal. Five menus said $21.99 and the other three said $22.99.  When we inquired, waitress simply said \"oh those are our old menus\".  If they are old then why are we given these?   We were surprised they did not resolve the issue, just put menus back in the pile up front.  Lobster bisque soup was extremely salty and not able to finish.  Lobster tail was way over cooked and burnt around the edges.  We will not be back here."}
{"text":"Went into red lobster around 0830 pm after going to boulder station and catching a good buzz. We went in and they set us at a quite table in a corner. I'm assuming so our diner could be romantic haha.   Our waiters name was Jesus and let me tell you about this man. He was amazing in every aspect. He brought water out immediately before we could even ask for it. Even though he sold us on a bottle of wine that you can get from a store for $9.00 that cost $27.00 at the restaurant. Our glass never went empty because he came over to fill it up before it could get there.   So I remember going to red lobster about 10 years ago and I don't know what happened. Red lobster used to be an upscale restaurant and now i fill like it falls in the same bracket as like Joes crab shack. People would go to red lobster for anniversary and romantic dinners but now you go just for great food. I hate the fact that it has lost the feeling of romance but the food is still amazing."}
{"text":"Can't get any better than hand battered fish! It was delicious,  I ordered for take out and it was ready on time, with extra tartar just as requested!"}
{"text":"It's Red Lobster. What do you expect. If you think it is going to be the best seafood you have ever had then you haven't had really good seafood. But at the same time it isn't the worst. It isn't some dark dirty place with questionable seafood that will make you sick just looking at it. It is what it is. You go to Red Lobster when they have a special. Which most of the time are pretty good and not to expensive for what you get. The regular menu, to me, is not to exciting. Same old same old. The most recent time I was here I got their pick two special for like $12 or $13 dollars. I got the shrimp and crab pot pie, which sounds interesting I know but it was actually pretty good, and the Parmesan fried shrimp. You think you need cocktail sauce for the shrimp but they taste great just by themselves. Overall it was surprisingly good. Plus who can resist their cheddar biscuits. So good. The pot pie was topped with the cheddar biscuit dough so it made it that much better. Like I said when they have a special that looks good I will be back. The restaurant is clean and nice and the service is always good. It is what it is."}
{"text":"I feel like for a Red Lobster this place is great. Service is excellent, food is decent, and the place itself is pretty nice (I'm surprised they remodeled recently).    Considering the price it's a top rating for me as the service is excellent and the food is good enough."}
{"text":"First time to this location and I was a little apprehensive because some Yelpers said it was dirty with sticky tables, etc.  I want to start off by saying we didn't experience this at all.  Everything looked clean and btw, this is a very large Red Lobster location.  We were greeting warmly ---there were very few people  on Labor Day so I guess they were glad to see us.   We ordered an appetizer which I normally don't do because I tend not to be able to eat my food if I do.  But I was with two other people who wanted an appetizer.  Ordered the calamari and veggies which was huge and delicious.  I really loved it.  The calamari were nicely fried but yet tender.  The broccoli florets were crispy and toothsome.  Ultimate Feast was a nice array of items including a lobster tail which was fresh and sweet.  The fettuccine with shrimp was delicious as was the New England Clam Chowder.  I ate so many Calamari that I couldn't eat the fried shrimp I ordered.  My issue was with my salad where I found a brownish core of an iceberg lettuce.  I told the server, Brittany C, and she apologized and didn't seem concerned that I had this brown plug in my salad.  I would have replaced the salad if I were a server.  We had two dirty martinis with extra olives.  Delivered with plenty of olives.  We were given 3 biscuits and usually for 3 people we get at least a repeat of the biscuits but it didn't happen.  I guess we should have asked.  When we got the bill, we had been overcharged on the martinis because they added a charge for a vodka upgrade.  The manager quickly took care of it.  PLUS I had an email for 15% off on total bill for Red Lobster and the manger quickly applied it.  Great management and I think I will be going back to this location.   The food was great minus the brown lettuce core in my salad."}
{"text":"My family had dinner there on 3/29/24.  We arrive there about fivish.  The place was packed.   We had maybe a 35 min. wait but that was to be expected so we sat at the bar. We ordered a couple of cocktails as we waited.   At most bars in restaurants you have more ice than drink but the drinks were very good and the bar maid very friendly.  We finally was seated at our table for dinner.  Within minutes our waitress came and took our order.  She was very polite and professional. And I could say it look as if she had  alot of tables assigned to her, but she was very good and  attentive to our needs and to the others tables she had assigned to her.  After we put our order in it was approximately 15 mins. our food was coming out.  It was more than enough of food we all had.  The food was delicious and very filling.   I can say I have never had a bad experience in Red Lobster."}
{"text":"I prefer to think of Red Lobster as a bar, and as such I give it 4 stars. Cold but slightly overpriced draft beer, great Long Island Iced Tea and decent apps. Wouldn't pay 20 bucks for a platter here though - but that's just me. Also, very nice and helpful staff. I have recently become addicted to their Sweet Chili Shrimp appetizer."}
{"text":"A friend and I went here for lunch the other day, it was pretty good! We got put in Ellen's section, a nice lady that was always smiling and attentive but not too much around. You know? We both had the 4 course meal for $16.99, you get choices for each course. I got the clam chowder, the fresh garden salad and the tilapia and brownie with vanilla ice cream for dessert. Soup was good, salad was super cold and super fresh. I don't think they chop lettuce too much though as one piece I had to cut into 4 pieces! Anyways, the tilapia came with broccoli (a little too cooked for my tastes) and rice pilaf (I'd get something else to replace this side next time-just bland). It was ok. The tilapia itself was outstanding. The dessert of brownie with vanilla ice cream is a MUST! Don't pass on it. It's not too big, but just enough. Although I could easily eat more. My friend got the clam chowder, the Caesar salad which he loved. He then got the pasta alfredo  with scallops and shrimp. I did taste it though and it was really good. He too got the dessert that I did.  So when you go to this red lobster, ask for Ellen's section! You will like the food and service. They just need to cook the broccoli less."}
{"text":"I visited this restaurant on 21 September 2017 @ lunch . Service was the worst. I ordered endless shrimp and only received one refill! However I could have just ordered off the menu and had one serving. My waitress was so slow and lied on the kitchen saying something was going on in the kitchen and it would take a while for refills . I remained patient. I was in red Lobster for a while (2 hours ) it took like 35 min to get the first refill. If it wasn't for the shift manager asking was everything ok, I wouldn't have received a water refill . I just asked for my bill and left. The female supervisor that was on shift at the time was not any help. After  explaining to her about my food and I thanking her for a refill on my water. I continued to still wait on my shrimp refill. She just said I apologize and gave our receipt as requested . I even went to the red lobster website and did the costumer survey. The store manager never reached out. Do not go to this location . I spend a lot of money during endless shrimp and this experience has been the worst ever . Go to concord mills or pineville location for better service! The worst experience ever!"}
{"text":"I had read past reviews so was concerned about taking our Mom there today for her birthday lunch. Red Lobster was her choice & we are very happy both with our meals and the service. I had the shrimp tacos which I really enjoyed. Our Mom (91 yrs old) & 4 others also said their meals were very good. The chocolate cake was delicious. They sang Happy Birthday making Mom's day. Servers & bartender were helpful & friendly. Today they were definitely deserving of a better rating."}
{"text":"Went here last night. The waitress there seemed like she didn't like her job. My daughter wanted Apple Juice and she came back and said they didn't have any so I told my daughter they didn't have any apple juice. She's 2 by the way and she through a little fit and I looked at the waitress and she had like a real stink-eye like \" omg I hate kids\" kind of look. She never refilled or drinks, checked on us once, her service was drab. I love red lobster but she made this experience unpleasant. My food was good, but the service not so much..."}
{"text":"For the first time I was impressed with service. Let me tell  what happened.  We came 9:56. 4 min before closing. Man we were hungry.  In side of restaurant was only James (manager) I asked if it's too late to dine.  He said not at all. So he did served us.  We felt like a VIP.  Food was good as usual.  But service was outstanding.  James. Thanks for your dedication. It's says a lot."}
{"text":"Ugh.  I don't know what happened to this chain over the years but what a disappointment! The only thing good on the menu any more are the biscuits.  They have removed any kind of dinner salad from the dinner menu, which is a huge loss,  as I used to crave their salad with lump crab.  Their special items are tired recyclings of the same things over and over.    At this location, I had to wait over 10 minutes to get a drink, and I was seated in the bar.  For the rest of the evening, every time someone came to the table, it was a different person.  I had their plank cooked salmon (can't remember the official name) and it was tasty but too big for me to even finish half with the sides that were the healthier options of a salad and broccoli.     Overall, it was exactly what I expected, which should concern the franchise.   Will return if I don't have any other options but I'm less and less inclined to continue going when there are tastier options available."}
{"text":"I give them 3 stars for the great service from our servers. Other than that their mediocre food took forever to come and we had plenty of time to get the sides to settle so by the time the shrimps arrived we are half way full. I might come back only for the biscuits."}
{"text":"Prices are a little high but hey...you're paying for seafood! Great service, great food, great atmosphere!   There were 5 of us and I think our eyes were way bigger than our stomachs today! We ordered sooo much food (see pics)! As usual, their biscuits were the bombbb! Portions were huge and quality of food was on point  Our server was really nice! She went through most of the menu with us and explained some of the dishes such as their holiday items and combinations you can make. She came back often to make sure everything was ok.   I'm not too big on \"red lobster\" but today's visit was a pleasant one so I would definitely return to this location in the future."}
{"text":"Food was great. Service was great. Great environment. The staff were super helpful and friendly. Food was delivered in a timely manner. The restaurant was super clean. Tiffany was a super nice hostess and  was very professional."}
{"text":"Service good and I liked my chicken tacos. Overall it seems to greasy for my liking (not my dish). I liked the biscuit as it was tasty.  Meals were really big."}
{"text":"You know what this place deserves a great review from me. Yeah, yeah I know what you're thinking \"Jamie it's just a Red Lobster\". It is a Red Lobster and I am a regular customer here because my dad loves this place and honestly I don't have anything bad to say about them. Their service has always been spectacular; all of their wait staff have been nothing but fun and friendly to my very dysfunctional family. I've had many items on the menu and have enjoyed everything. Not to mention, they have a great bar. Where else can I get a double sized frozen margarita with my seafood meal? This place handles large parties gracefully and easily splits checks when needed. This Red Lobster has served me and my family well for years. I love the different \"fest\" seasons too, Lobster Fest being my favorite!"}
{"text":"The food is okay. It tastes decent but there is nothing amazing. Service is pretty good. For the most part,  it is just overpriced seafood."}
{"text":"Delicious, great location, clean. Eric our waiter was a pleasure and very accomadating. This place is a treat for me considering it is pricey but when I go I go all out! Recommend the Lobster and Mussel bake w/linguine...not exact name but you'll see the pic and know. I wish I would have ordered it w/ no tomatoes, wasnt really a fan but it still tasted great. Also The Ultimate Feast was a big hit with my boyfriend. I rarely hear him say he is stuffed, so plus. Open late, very nice! Enjoy the surf while we still can!"}
{"text":"I've been to this location a few times now. We ordered Chicken linguini and create your lunch.. it was actually well made and good. However portions are a bit on the smaller side.   My biggest issue is with the one of the waitress. I ordered a \"Create your lunch\" and then the waitress asked me what kind of salad did I want. I assumed it came free with the meal i ordered. (Red lobsters from my past experiences used to include salad, soup for free.. I dont know if it changed or its just this location).. After we got the bill I saw a separate charge for the Salad. Not too happy about that.."}
{"text":"The last two take out orders from here have been awful! We ordered on New Year's Eve & I waited at least 35 minutes at the bar for the food to be ready & left the house late to give them extra time. I called and let the manager know about my frustration & concerns with the wait I had. He kindly mailed us a $25 gift card since that wasn't how it should've been. Fast forward to tonight, I thought I'd give them another chance with the gift card we got. Ordered online, waited about 5-10 min, took a shower, & here I am waiting at the bar ...... AGAIN with three other guests waiting on their to go orders. They need to get their kitchen up to speed! I understand they may be busy, but my goodness HIRE MORE PEOPLE! You obviously have the business. I will not be back for a while after tonight.    Got home & no marinara for the mozzarella sticks!"}
{"text":"We just had the best experience ever at Red Lobster. Our server Roy made our experience so enjoyable we will be back just for him. His service was impeccable and went the extra mile to ensure we were taken care of. Someone in my party had trouble cracking the crab leg shells. Roy threw on a pair of gloves and started cracking for us. He stood there and got all the crab meat out for my guest. The food of course was great but it was Roy that had us bragging. Kudos Red Lobster on hiring just an amazing waiter. See you soon!"}
{"text":"Shrimp fest, lobster fest, and now crab fest. We had the crab lovers dream and it was very good with a larger portion than expected. Good service all around and they kept the cheddar biscuits coming?"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to go when I want to celebrate a special occasion. There's just something about the ambience that makes my experience so wonderful.  Everytime I've been here, the service has been top notch.  The food is the star here though. I cannot get enough of their world-famous endless buttery biscuits. They're SO hard to resist. My go-to dish is the shrimp trio. I absolutely love their garlic butter shrimp. The last time I came here, I changed it up and ordered the snow crab feast instead and it was heavenly.  I cannot say enough good things about the Red Lobster. I'm extremely looking forward to celebrating my next special occasion with you guys!  10/5 if I could."}
{"text":"We came in for a drink at the bar and after 8 minutes (yes I counted) of being ignored by the bartender that was complaining about having to take call in orders someone finally came up and acknowledged that we were there and took our order. It was a frustrating situation but we decided to go pick up the kids and come back for dinner. We expected a wait which was fine, about 25 minutes. We got seated and it took about 10 minutes before we saw our waiter and then another 10 before we got our drinks. Our salad and bread came out with our food which was a little irritating. Our waiter was obviously swamped, I don't think there was a time where I didn't see him running around correcting orders. He was great but everything else was EXTREMELY slow. We got our food, which was actually not exactly what we ordered but it was corrected (eventually). We will probably not be back to this location, I'd rather drive to Gastonia if I really want Red Loster."}
{"text":"Visited this location while on vacation.  Although there are plenty of Red Lobsters in my area, I had never been adventitious enough to try mussels. Well, when in Vegas...anyway, they were awesome!  The restaurant was clean, service was prompt, food was great!  I recommend."}
{"text":"The best staff ever. I have a lot of anaphylactic allergies to food and the manager came and took a picture of my list. Then talked to the chef for me to eat great food and not have an allergic reaction. I love this place."}
{"text":"The crabfest rocks! I'll go there again. The bartender waited on us and Ryan was great. I'd recommend this place to everyone!"}
{"text":"Yep, it's a Red Lobster, so the food is going to be exactly what you'd expect.   This location was great, tho - excellent service, and well prepared food.   We came in around 7 on a Wednesday night and they quoted a 25 minutes wait, which was about accurate. There's tons of waiting room seating, so it was fine.  Food and drinks came out really quickly, substitutions were accommodated with no hassles, and service was just all around friendly and efficient. The host station even called a cab for us at the end of the night.   No issues with this location, it was a very pleasant dinner out."}
{"text":"Pretty good, even though they do not have endless salad refills like some competitors. Their Caesar Salads are great and their seafood generally is too."}
{"text":"The food is generally great but during Lobster Fest Season you need Reservations. You can sit at the bar but not at a table in the bar without them, as these are included in their Seating List. Virgin Pina Coladas are the best in town, due to their secret mix. The service and food is usually exceptional, even if you don't drink alcohol and must sit in the lounge."}
{"text":"Wow! I've been eating at all three Red Lobsters for the fifteen years I've lived in Las Vegas and today I had one of the best Maine Lobster Tails I've ever had !! The waitress Christina and manager Brandon were absolutely fabulous and the manager came to the table and said he did oversee the cooking. At another location, I'd been served seared blackened tail once and I was trying to be sure it was steamed!! It was magnificently made with sweetest service!! And they served the platter of Crab Linguini and a Virgin Pina Colada! Favorite Ever!!!"}
{"text":"I'm very disappointed in this Red Lobster! We will never be eating there again. My husband called Friday to make a reservation for our monthly date. (Side note: we have a one year old so monthly dates are a must!) Well they said they don't do reservations Friday-Sunday. Fine ok we understood! So we decided to go out tonight, this time with the baby. (Other side note: husband thinks the waitress was annoyed by our son. Look, we wanted to have our son there. Get over it.) My husband called \"Sorry, we don take reservations\" what? Not at all? Which is fine I mean some restaurants don't but, you should have said that the FIRST time we called. Ok fast forward to tonight, we still decided to go. Let me tell you this, I'm a light weight, I had two drinks and they barely had anything in them. If I pay for alcohol I expect there to be alcohol in the drinks because they aren't cheap! We've been here before. We get a military discount EVERYTIME! All of a sudden now we have to be in uniform to get a discount!? We are veterans we CANT wear our uniforms. Something \"fishy\" about this place. I don't like it."}
{"text":"Just tried the Red Lobster crab cakes that were advertised on TV which look so thick and delicious on screen.  The photo on the menu also made them look scrumptious.  Well, I had them as part of a combo meal and all I can say is that they were thin, over breaded and super, super, super fishy tasting.  Real crab cakes don't smell or taste like these.  I've had crab cakes in many, many restaurants and these are not it.  My server, Cheryl, didn't bother to come by to ask if I was enjoying my meal (at least the other two portions of the three item combo) .  I guess she could see that the crab cakes were not being eaten and didn't want to deal with it.   It was not my best time in Red Lobster although I have enjoyed the food here in the past."}
{"text":"Parking - easy.  Wait - none.   Food - delicious. I had the Ultimate feast with lobster tail (great), crab legs (good), fried shrimp (so-so) and shrimp alfredo (great).   Service - good."}
{"text":"Andrew is amazing! He's fast and is very friendly. I don't go to Red Lobster that often anymore but when I do, I visit this location. My favorite items are the lobster pizza, shrimp scampi and of course their biscuits! I cannot get enough of those biscuits! They have all you can eat shrimp deals throughout the year and the shrimp scampi is so delicious, that I would say it's definitely a good deal. In general, their appetizers are pretty but I would say besides lobster pizza, the mozzarella sticks would be my second favorite.   One thing that annoys me about this location is the cleanliness of the restaurant. It's not always the best...but it looks more like lazy cleaning than a dirty restaurant. If that makes sense."}
{"text":"Sunday night.  They are short staffed. Lyssa is great but mgmt should be fired for cutting staff. 45 minutes for salads and biscuits."}
{"text":"Red Lobster @ North Olmstead, OH, U.S.A., ????????????????????????  ??????????????????????????????????  ???????????????????20km????????????????????????????????  ???????????????????????????????????  ???????????????????????  ????? ???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????  ?????????????????  ????????????????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"Absolutely horrifying. I wanted to get lobster as I've tried it but never my own. Its a 50 50 because my moms was decent.... mine was a burnt tail shell with rubbery meat and sharp black things. For 44 dollars I could have made several lobsters and never having made one I think with Google it would have turned out edible. They asked if like another, and I explained I will likely never eat any again. On a 44 dollar meal that's a pretty big screw up. Other red lobsters have better reviews but I doubt if I'd even go to those. I am very seriously horrified. Its insanely up charged a 27 dollar meal turned into 44 because of mashed potato upgrades. Just make some shrimp and save yourself the heart ache."}
{"text":"We have not been to a Red Lobster in a while and decided to have lunch on a week day.    The service was pleasant, not terribly slow.   The food was tottaly \"blah.\"   There was just no flavor. We ordered the seafood platter, the New England clam chowder (bad), the crab with linguini arrived lukewarm (a/c was brutal and could be the reason);  our side dishes (2 out of 3, they forgot 1) arrived when we were finishing our meal.     We remember Red Lobster food was tastier, even their rolls were larger, moist and you could taste the cheese!!     We were seated with full view of the kitchen and saw only one person wearing a hair netting.   Several people in the kitchen with long hair, beards,  no gloves.    Will not return."}
{"text":"Heard it was Lobster Fest so had to return.  Everything was great but I found out that the lobster stuffed mushroom caps and the lobster pizza are on the menu year-round and I missed out because I was waiting for the Lobster Fest all the time. Oh well.  Good to know I can have them whenever.  I'm thinking that I should try the lobster nachos next time so I'll review those in the future."}
{"text":"Just came in to get some late dinner and got sat down and about 3 min the server comes by and says ill be with you in just a min and while we are looking through the menu 10 min passes by no water or biscuit is out on the table. And I look around the to see if its busy and other people who came in little after my group already has water and biscuits and the server was in the kitchen laughing and giggling with other server while our mouth is getting super dry! Never coming back to this location!"}
{"text":"Walked in @ 2:25pm walk up to bar to place a Togo order, bartender never acknowledge me, then a manager walks behind the bar and starts talking to the bartender(female) still I sat there with not even a hello, there was 3 young ladies eating @ the bar @ 1 table so it wasn't busy, I get up and walk back to the host stand and says is anyone working she grabs her silverware and goes to other tables, I stated I guess you guys don't want my $$ and left!  I guess maybe because I had a carrabbas T-Shirt on that they felt some type of way....oh well I'll spend my $$ elsewhere"}
{"text":"These 4 stars are for Dana the bartender & the two appetizers that I had. The calamari & stuffed mushrooms were hot & fresh. No complaints there.   Dana made me the BEST long island iced tea I've ever had & I've had more than quite a few. She made me feel very welcomed & took good care of me. I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Our servers name was Heather and she was so great! The food was great. She was very attentive really nice and she was all over the best server ever"}
{"text":"I am wondering if we were just here on an off night because the reviews for this place aren't bad. I just can't give it any more stars. The service was horrible. We sat at the table for 10 minutes with out drinks. When we ordered, I got a sangria and water, and my husband a peach tea and water. First they brought the wrong tea, my sangria was correct, but no waters. I had to ask her twice before she brought them. She asked us if we wanted another basket of bisqiuts, we said yes!  Well, we never received that second basket. We got the pound shrimp with potatoes and corn. The potatoes were ok, but the corn was soggy. When we were leaving, our waitress was texting on her phone. Guess she was too busy doing that to serve our drinks.  If you like slow service and no drinks, then I guess you would enjoy this place. I left my debit card there, and sadly had to come back. I went the next evening to get it, and it took almost ten minutes for the manager to come up. I sat there forever. They were not busy. They had to call back to the manager twice. I guess I shouldn't of expected it to be a fast trip considering our service the night before. We won't be returning."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch on a Sunday once... the service was very much not attentive.  The grilled shrimp skewers had this weird squirt of the sauce down them instead of being well coated in it.  The food was decent."}
{"text":"I brought a friend here who was visiting from out of town who wanted to go.  We went during Crab Fest and I had the Dueling Crab legs.  This is essentially king crab, dungeoness crab, and an ear of corn.  It was fine and edible, but nothing to write home about.  I found it to taste more like saltwater than actual crab. I wasn't expecting the moon from a chain seafood restaurant, but at $26-$31 per crab plate that we got, our money would have been better spent elsewhere."}
{"text":"Had a great lunch with my girlfriend here today. Ate all kinds of good food. Definitely will come back again. Our server Desiree was awesome. No happy hour specials here, but that's ok, we were prepared and brought the happy :))). Prices are very good already. A must stop for tourists and great for locals, too. Cya"}
{"text":"Went here with my husband for the first time on our five year wedding anniversary and was blown away with both the service and quality of the food. I was able to make reservations ahead of time and upon arrival was seated as soon as we walked through the door without the wait. Our waitress was awesome and very attentive- our glasses never went empty and the food.... AMAZING. My husband cannot eat shellfish due to allergies so he ordered a steak, with a Caesar salad, baked potato and broccoli.... his steak was tender and juicy, flavorful and cooked to perfection. I ordered the ultimate feast and this was BY FAR the best BEST lobster I have ever had hands down!! The Caesar Salad was out of this world- truly amazing, I could have eaten just that an been satisfied. We typically like Outback Steakhouse for our steaks- BUT this place blows them out of the water (even on price point...) Found a new fave, and can't wait to go back for my bday dinner"}
{"text":"Typical chain restaurant experience.  A group was going, so I was forced to go along!  Otherwise, I prefer non-chain restaurants that food is custom flavored!  Call ahead seating told 20 minutes, we were there one hour 30  minutes before we got a table!  We had a larger party, 2 waiters,one was great, one was so,so.  Food was typical, nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"After reading all the horrible reviews I hesitated to go, but I was hungry for lobster. I am so glad I went. The place was spotless the service was excellent and the food was very fresh so I think it's under new management. I had the ultimate feast and everything on the plate was delicious.   I have been back twice and just as pleased!"}
{"text":"Service is sooooooo slow. Here on Veterans Day to celebrate with my husband. Waitress took our drunk order, and about \"15\" mins later came back to get food order. The place was not very busy so I don't understand the slowness. Servers standing around chatting away and obviously not working. So annoyed and hungry."}
{"text":"Visited for lunch 3/21/15 1pm for lunch. The Chef on staff today is not up to Par. The biscuits were too hard. The parmesean crusted chicken was good, but the pasta had way too much butter sitting around the edges. The salad had too many hard pieces. The server Ellen was excellent and one of the best servers I've ever had at a red lobster."}
{"text":"Always a great place to eat. This I would say is my husband favorite restaurant.  He is the kind of person that will find one thing and order it every time we go.  I had just gotten off work so I was a bit tired but it was my idea to go.  I went straight to the restroom when we got there.  When I came out my husband had been seated right next to the restroom doors,  with the sun shining right in our faces.  Asked the little hostess girl to please close the blinds and she said wr would have to wait because there whee people sitting at the table where she needed to closed them at.  (She had just seated the family). The mother must have heard me because she was the one to close them.   Our waitress was good, I think maybe a little busy she seemed to be in a hurry.  Our biscuit came out hot and fresh.  She took our order and came right back with our salads.  When our food came out about 15 min later wr could not eat.  We had not silver ware at our table.  We had to flag our waitress down.      Me, I like to try new things. This times when we went it was lobster fest.  My husband as always ordered the admirals fest and I decided to go with the lobster lovers dream.  Not being a fan of green veggies so I opted for mashed potatoes.  My rock lobster was good it melted in my mouth.  My alfrado with shrimp and lobster was ok.  To much shrimp and not the good kind.  I would have taken a few Nice sized shrimp instead of three small salad shrimp they have me.  When I finally got to my main tail lobster it was over cooked and rubbery.    We will eat at red lobster again but I suggest going to the one on valley view and 215. Better cooks, better service and better food."}
{"text":"This was a goodRed Lobster, both food and friendly service.  Sorry to see it closed on 07/26/2014.  Apparently the parent company Darden sold the land back to the city (or directly to a developer) for a development project."}
{"text":"Last night, the drinks and food was so good I was very pleased with food and service. I left a very satisfied customer. It was crowded too."}
{"text":"My fiancée and I came in at about 6:20 and it is a Friday night. The hostesses were very friendly and sat us immediately. Our server, Andrea, quickly greeted us and was very very pleasant. She was amazing! Our drinks came out quickly and she was very helpful. Every part of our meal from appetizer to dessert was delicious, and timed perfectly. We started with mozzarella sticks which were wonderful. We both had the shrimp trio and we got a cheesecake to go. The food was all delicious and I will definitely be coming back and asking for Andrea again soon!"}
{"text":"Everytime I come here our waiter\waitress is so friendly our food is always good and fresh and if we ever don't like something they immediately fix it I won't go to any other red lobster"}
{"text":"The good service and cleanliness cannot overcome overcooked and stringy lobster and king crab legs. First time, last time."}
{"text":"I went hear for dinner on Saturday, 4/21/12.  What can you say?  It's Red Lobster.    We went because we had craving for Seafood.  And they were having their Lobster Fest.  The food was fresh and tasty.  We were able to get in quick.  For the meal and price, I got my moneys worth.   This is not a regular.  It has probably been a year since I went to a Red Lobster.  And probably will be another year before I go again.  But it is dependable and I walk away full.   BTW...  I think the best part is are the cheddar biscuits!!  And they must be in limited supply because even after asking our waitress twice for some more, we they never managed to come...  Probably why they got 3 Stars and not 4 this time."}
{"text":"Decent service on Saturday afternoon, it was getting close to dinner time so it was a 20 minute wait if we wanted a booth- opted for the lounge instead.  The food was absolutely horrible for me, my friend said his food was ok... For that price I expect better and doubt I'd be coming back."}
{"text":"What can you say?  It is frozen seafood from a large chain restaurant.  It will never be horrible but it will also never be outstanding.  We got a gift card to them for Christmas, so we went for a seafood fix.  We both got the Admiral's Feast, which has all fried seafood (fish, shrimp, bay scallops, and clam strips).  It also comes with a salad, a side dish (we both got baked potato), and their signature cheddar bay biscuits.  I love their biscuits and they never disappoint.  The salad was a salad, nothing special.  The baked potato was fine and they gave me enough sour cream when I asked for extra.  For the main dish, the fish was nice, the bay scallops were quite good, and the shrimp were also quite good.  I didn't care much for the clam strips, they were overcooked, dry, and tough.  Our server was efficient and we never felt we needed to ask for anything before he was there to take care of us.  All in all, I would go back as I love seafood and it is hard to find decent seafood here.  I grew up on the coast of the Gulf of Mexico so I miss having good, fresh seafood readily available."}
{"text":"While the food is OK, it is far from great seafood. For the price, it is rather unremarkable, and we all left feeling not quite satisfied.  Very expensive for what you get. I now remember why it has been so long since our last visit to Red Lobster."}
{"text":"Excellent food we've eaten here over the last couple years, food has always been great. Service is good but if you want the best service every, ask for the Hawaiian Barbie ( Maxine) she'll take GREAT care of you. She is the real deal, very friendly and very helpful. She will make your dinning experience outstanding."}
{"text":"Went to Red Lobster with my family for the first time ever to enjoy the endless shrimp deal they are currently running. The food was very filling but the service was not the best. Our waitress was very slow. While I waited about 15 minutes for a box I noticed something moving on my food. It was a baby roach. I brought this to the attention of another waitress and within 5 minutes the manager came over and asked if I wanted another plate. I declined and he gave us a 20 percent discount  (which covered my meal). All in all I will not be eatting her ever again. And I would recommend checking your food before eatting."}
{"text":"Once again Red Lobster makes me full and happy. Haven't been to this location in a while and it definitely exceeded my expectations. We had Melvin as our server and he was awesome! Attentive, friendly and fast. Manager came around and asked how we were doing (which I love to see). I ordered the coconut shrimp and it was delicious.  My husband ordered parmesan crusted tilapia and it was on point and flavorful. Place was clean, staff was nice and food was great. Definitely going to be returning soon. If you come in, ask for Melvin :)"}
{"text":"WhAt. A  disapointment......we ordered a salmon plate , my daughter a sirloin and wifey ordered. A shrimp kabobs, we got our drinks at 155 then about 245 we got our plates,food was barely warm, server was alright, though"}
{"text":"I got food poisoning from this location and I will not be back to eat at any red lobster ever again. I was very sick for 2 weeks.. I'm not sure what it was exactly that I ate that made me so sick but I ordered the clam chowder soup, Caesar salad and the ultimate platter. My guess is something with the sea food. I couldn't even leave the restaurant without having to go to the bathroom and since I left that place I had uncontrollable diarrhea for 2 weeks. Never again.."}
{"text":"food was ok however the service could have been better.. My wife and I didn't get our drinks until after we were done with our salads."}
{"text":"Lots of good specials and new Monday-Thursday Happy Hour available! Great service with a even better overall experience. Don't mind the wall because they are still there!"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner with my husband expecting decent seafood. We sat down, ordered mojitos and had some of their cheese biscuits, both were delicious! Then it went downhill! My husband had a black curly hair in his Caesar salad, sat with it for about 15 min before our waiter came over and noticed something was wrong. We mentioned it, she apologized and took it away asking if he wanted another which at this point was not an option since our main meal was being served. I had the broiled sole which was horrible!! The fish was over cooked making it the texture of a paste. I nearly got sick once I tasted it as it was horrible and tasted like old, rotten mushy fish. The waitress offered me something else but at this point, I couldn't stomach eating any other seafood. My husband's meal ended up being ok, he ordered crab legs. At the end, both of our meals were comped and we only paid for the mojitos which were the best part of the meal. However after this experience we will never eat at a red lobster again!"}
{"text":"I don't usually review restaurant chains, but I was very happy with my recent visit here. We were a group of 6 and our server, Bianca was absolutely wonderful. She was a patient, attentive, helpful and thorough.  As everyone knows, the biscuits here are delicious, fresh, warm and abundant. The garden salad was very plain and simple and nothing special, but I am glad they put the dressing on the side.  For appetizers we had the lobster pizza, the mussels, and the seafood stuffed mushrooms. Two of the three starters were free using the coupon from their website with the purchase of two adult dinner entrees. The lobster pizza looked a bit sad and the dough wasn't cooked enough, the mussels were just okay, and the seafood stuffed mushrooms were as good as always.  I decided to make my own combination plate consisting of a maple and bacon shrimp skewer, a garlic-grilled shrimp skewer, and the coconut shrimp. All for $23.99, not bad at all! I really enjoyed the maple bacon shrimp the most, I highly recommend trying this new menu item! The coconut shrimp was my second favourite and then the less flavourful garlic-grilled shrimp. I also wish they had a mango chutney or something else as the dip for the coconut shrimp instead of their signature pina colada sauce which I don't care for because I don't like pineapple. I also quite enjoyed their rice which I happened to get a lot of so no complaints there.   Some other entrees included: popcorn shrimp, the ultimate feast, salmon new orleans, fire-grilled tacos and a stuffed sole, coconut shrimp and garlic shrimp combo.  Overall, our server made the experience great! It was my Mom's birthday so she brought her a free dessert and they sang Happy Birthday. And she even gave us a separate bag of fresh biscuits to go with our take home boxes and not the extra ones we had leftover on our table!"}
{"text":"We've been here a couple of times and compared to other RL's, I think this one is above par.  Hence, the 4 stars.  Compared to other places though, probably 2 or 3 stars.  They basically salt and butter the hell out of everything and I feel like the cheese biscuits don't taste as good as they used to and I've been going to RLs since I was a kid.  This specific location though had good service, it was clean, and their cookie dessert was delicious.  If I was in the mood for RL - which isn't often - then this place definitely does the trick."}
{"text":"Typical Red Lobster.  Busy.  Good service. Food is delish.... cant get enough of those biscuits!"}
{"text":"Really good biscuits. almost a zillion calories in each, but irresistible. Ambiance is nice, very relaxing seats. The waitress was very cooperative. I kept on asking lame questions and she kept on answering with a friendly smile. Overall, pretty nice."}
{"text":"My husband and I periodically accompany my husbands elderly parents to this location. My elderly in-law's loyalty to this location stems from a server, Michael. I wanted to let the management and Michael himself know how much my husband and I appreciate him and the care and kindness he shows our parents. They are in their eighties, and I know they can sometimes be difficult. How ever, they feel Michael is more like family than just an employee that cares for them in a restaurant. Michael goes above and beyond to make the feel welcome and as if they are the only table in the restaurant. This has not just been once or twice. My husband and I married five years ago. I believe it was sometime that first year I went with them to your store, the first time for my birthday, so he has been waiting on them for several years, each time as if they were his favorite customers ever. If I recall correctly, a few years back Michael injured his knee or had knee surgery or something along that line, and our parents were not sure if they would ever come back because if Michael was gone, so were they! Anyway, food and beverage is a difficult business. I just waned you to know how amazing Michael is. Thank you to you both. And we have had no occasion that were not happy and satisfied with the food and did not leave with enough food for lunch the following day. :)  P.S. We were just in for Mom's birthday, and we also gave her another Red Lobster gift card. Dad's birthday is in June, so we most certainly will be seeing you all again very soon. :)  And a P.S. To Doc H. Thank you for your amusing review. If you are looking for \"fine dining\", don't take your snooty European friends to a family chain restaurant. Red Lobster does not pretend to be anything more than it is, an affordable chain seafood restaurant. Seriously, get over your fine falutin' self! LOL"}
{"text":"Okay, so been coming here for years and every time I come something is wrong with the food. I only have 2 Red Lobster's close by so this one is only a tad bit better than the other. If you order steak it will not be cooked the way you want it, side dishes are rarely hot, not to mention they went up on the prices so not worth it!!! If you are anxious for the biscuits like me than you'll be waiting until damn near your food comes out. Today I ordered a WELL DONE steak and it came out so rare it had blood on the plate. That's what prompted me to write a review because the kitchen sucks this will be my last visit!"}
{"text":"I used to love this place so much but the past 2 times we've been we have left disappointed. The service is always excellent but the food just seemed like it was not done to its Red Lobster potential. I ordered popcorn shrimp and it tasted like it had been sitting a long time then served. I also ordered broccoli as my side and it was so mushy I couldn't even eat it. This was the second time in a row the food wasn't up to our expectations. My husband wouldn't even order fish the second time because of the way his tasted prior. Hopefully this location steps up with the food preparation so I can go back to loving it!"}
{"text":"Excellent meal.  Had the 4 course dinner for $16.99.  Service was great (thank you Leon).  The meal came a bit fast as we hadn't even started our soup, but overall, a very good experience tonight."}
{"text":"Very clean.  Server answered the questions we had.  The triple berry sangria was Amazing."}
{"text":"Once in a while when my family is craving a nice seafood dish close to home, we will go to Red Lobster in Thornhill. We've been going to this location for as long as I remember, and their renovations in the past few years has really modernized the place while still keeping true to the brand.  They have many different selections in their menu. I always prefer their \"Ultimate Feast\" dish which includes crab, lobster, garlic shrimp, & etc. I always swap \"Walt's Favorite Shrimp\" which is basically popcorn shrimp, to their delicious coconut shrimp. There is an extra charge, which I found unnecessary.  Steer clear from their lobster linguine, I had mine and it was absolutely soaked in oil. The plate wasn't hot, and tasted like it was left under a heater for a while.  One pasta dish that is good is the lobster bake! It's filling, and has a variety of seafood in one dish. If you're craving mussels and scallops, this should be your go-to!  One of the best appetizers to get is definitely the stuffed mushrooms, you will not be disappointed.  With the appetizer, salad, and main dish, you'll be lucky to get to the dessert. I haven't had dessert at Red Lobster in a very long time because I'm always full.  Though it's your typical chain restaurant, you always leave with a full stomach.   My only critique, is that I wish the hostess was more friendly. She had zero energy, and looked like she didn't care about her job. Also, the waiters were not taking dishes away and clearing the table. I understand its usually busy, but it's nice to be checked up on, and not always having to flag down a server."}
{"text":"Our great evening started with no wait, which is always the best way to start any meal at a restaurant. The food was amazing and served quickly. We had steak and seafood as entrees, all cooked and seasoned to perfection. The daiquiri and Bahamas Mama we ordered were mixed wonderfully.   Our server, Lauren, was friendly, knowledgeable and prompt on soda refills and everything else we needed.     We were there for a celebration, and the great meal, drinks and customer service just made our day fantastic!"}
{"text":"I am writing my review based on my experience last friday (Dec. 26th 2014) when I came in for dinner. I had always came here with my family and we loved the food and experience but when I came in last week, it was like something from a horror show. I couldn't believe the customer service that was not only received but being given to those around us. When we came in, a gentleman said he'd be right with us to seat us. He never came back. Another person came to get us but started giggling and laughing and said to hold on a sec. He was looking at the seating charts I suppose. Another individual came up to help him and they had a whole conversation about where to seat us and who just got someone prior, etc etc. I am standing there in shock because not ONE but TWO other individuals came to help JUST to find us a seat. 4 people and neither could decide where until 1 of them asked a girl behind him if he could seat us with her. She didn't even look up and said \"ya sure\" in a bothered way. What the heck. I am sorry? We came in just to have a meal and be on our way. Instead we had this circus chain of actions. It gets better. We finally sat down around the right side of the restaurant. I noticed a table near us who had a different waitress. A gentleman asked her if he could have his fork and knife changed out while handing it to her, she rudely asked twice \"excuse me what?\" and he repeated. She said \"Ok yeah\" and walked away without even grabbing the utensils he was trying to hand her. We immediately got up and just left. Don't get me wrong, I love Red Lobster, they got wonderful food and beverages. I am rating this based on our experience at this location and how it was handled. The place wasn't even busy that night. There was only 2 other tables on the right side of the restaurant we sat at."}
{"text":"Had a gift card so we got items off the lobster fest menu. The service was great. The food was really good. Probably the best meal I have had at a red lobster. The cheesebread here is my favorite bread anywhere! The shrimp scampi are my favorite and were really flavorful. No complaints! I hadn't been to red lobster in probably over a year but this meal was really surprisingly good and I would go back now more regularly. They also put coupons regularly in the paper so we got $4 off our bill which always makes me happy :)"}
{"text":"Today I went and this is the worst experience I've ever had I feel discriminated server never prebused our table I was getting the check and we still had salad and appetizer plates that we just keep stacking and she never picked up any we ordered 3 endless shrimp an appetizer and one kids chicken strips we only got one set of refills and we had 2 at the table I asked her for one and she said we were staking that it was like a buffet and we had to finish everything before we get more and we couldn't take any home at all I said that's fine u can take those shrimp plates but I need a box for my baby's chicken strips, she never came back with the box we had a free appetizer coupon manager came to the table saw all the pile of plates and didn't even said anything so we just said what ever but the same server had a 10 or 9 top didn't really count them and they were all boxing stuff and had the same server so really??? I'm just so disappointed we never had an issue at this loctation or any here in vegas!!!"}
{"text":"The wait staff is extremely nice and attentive.  Let's talk biscuits - fabulous! My son loves their lobster and crab, so we head over for special occasions.   Everything is great every time we eat there. I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Went here again the other night after a bad experience last year, with my friends Dora and Mark.  Maybe they had listened to what people had to say...  NOT.  Went for the \"All you can eat Shrimpfest\".  What they didn't tell you is you end up waiting 45 minutes for your first plate, so rather then feast on an all you can eat you end up full of bread while waiting. You have to order two shrimp dishes (not for the regular menu) and after the two you must order little dishes one at a time.  They also don't tell you that Shrimpfest shrimps are not the regular ones but shrimpier shrimps. This was pointed out by our server who was completely unattentive or empathetic.  Yet again Red Lobster is a NO GO."}
{"text":"Food's good, but Monday's menu change was a definite disappointment.   The 4-Course Feast has now been changed to Monday through Thursday only! :'( Another reasonably priced dinner option gone."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful time!   We were seated right away and our waiter Jay was friendly and very helpful. We all decided to have the Endless Shrimp. Endless amounts of several different types of shrimp with either a house or Cesar salad and those delicious biscuits!!!! Yummy!  My favorite type was the Parmesan Shrimp. They were very similar to the shrimp scampi, which is another personal favorite but with a delicious cheesy breading....then they are baked again and come out hot and overflowing with cheese. Soooo good!  However, all the other options were great too. We also enjoyed the shrimp pasta which was full of flavor, the fried shrimp that were crispy and the glaze on the Teriyaki Grilled Shrimp was so tasty!   Our food came out hot and it was really endless....we were stuffed and happy when we left so overall that means it was a great meal and I look forward to going back!"}
{"text":"Went to dinner with the family. It's usually a whatever visit. But, Service and food was actually pretty good. We were waited on by Mason! Hostess can actually try and smile a little more. If you don't like your job or your tired it is for sure not our fault. Customer service I'm sure is in the job description."}
{"text":"Just came back from the Endless Shrimp special, and not only am I stuffed, they sent us home with even more shrimp, and the fixin's, too. Service from Mike B. & Alika could not have been better and everything we tried (which is to say, every variety they offered) was cooked just right. The three of us had around five varieties each, with seconds and even thirds on some (and the portions were _not_ skimpy). Now, we're not big, truck-drivin' mamas, just three ladies who lunch, and we made a bargain and an afternoon of it. So, how much shrimp, plus salad, sides, and biscuits, can _you_ put away for just $16.99? Endless Shrimp is one special of a special, even by Red Lobster standards."}
{"text":"we went to the red lobster on merivale road in neapen we waited forty five minutes for are table ans was seated right were the kitchen door was having people come in and out also i was seated on a chair at the end of are booth was very uncomferable it was my mothers birthday or i would have walked out as soon as i saw the garbage that was fed to us the plates were not full the product looked like it was frozen and nobody finished there meal even the dog at home refused to eat it it cost one hundred and forty five dollers for total crap never again you should return are money for wrecking my mothers birthday"}
{"text":"This is the 3rd time coming to this Red Lobster and the last!  Each time my family has gone the food has been mediocre and the service is very lacking!  The waitress was nice but really didn't see her much at all!  I don't mind spending money on a great meal but the food here has never impressed me!"}
{"text":"Awesome food. Service are good. Folks are very cooperative. Their biscuits are pretty damn good. I am fully satisfied with their service."}
{"text":"I hadn't been to a Red Lobster in years so when I was given a gift card I decided to take my girls and see what was new.  When we went the Shrimp Festival was going on so that made it even better. We started off with Boston Peach Ice Teas as it came highly recommended by our waitress Bethany G. Man were they good! I love peaches and iced tea so it was a win win!   My wife had a Tossed Salad and a bowl of the Clam Chowder. Our daughter have the Brown Butter Scampi, Coconut Shrimp and Lobster Mashed Potatoes and I had a bowl of the Lobster Bisque Soap and the Lobster Tacos. All of our food was delicious and defiantly made me want to come back more often.  Bethany G. was great she even made sure we have extra fresh cheddar biscuits to take with our doggy bags and even gave was full to go cups of that delious Boston Peach Ice Tea to take with us on our way home.  My only real complaint is that they didn't have enough servers working and it took a little long to get our entrees but, once we got them the food was defiantly worth the wait."}
{"text":"Always a nice dinner at this red lobster! Fresh and cooked perfectly, last night was no exception. Our waitress Tasha was attentive, quick and lovely! We were so hungry we ordered a lobster pizza as an appetizer and it was amazing. The shrimp trio was delicious and the salmon shrimp dinner was very good. The linguini was perfectly cooked and didn't feel heavy. We will continue to enjoy special nights here."}
{"text":"Me and my hubby never really have the time to go out but hey its lobster fest so off we went to red lobster with high hopes and empty bellies. The wait wasn't terrible but the server was awful. No refills on the rolls, no follow up on drinks/water, got my drink order wrong, and then fussed at me and said \"well you ordered your strawberry lemonade wrong\"...how??? As she is telling me there are no  free refills on those I let her know that I'm aware and that's fine. It takes 15min to get it and its full of ice. Two swallows and it's gone. So at this point my husband is sucking ice because evidently sprite is at a premium in this place. In my utter foolishness I order another.  No lie it didn't come out until after we received our food and had eaten. I reminded her twice that I wanted another and her response was \" i told you no free refills!\". Ma'am I know just bring me my drink. Finally when we finish paying for everything, including my 2nd drink that I hadnt gotten yet, she brings it out. I asked for a to go cup and it took her so long I had my husband go to the bar to get me a cup himself. We left before she came back. She was inattentive and extremely unprofessional the entire time. Thanks for making my once every 4month date night suck"}
{"text":"I know it's odd to see your resident vegetarian writing a review on Red Lobster, but bear with me.  My boyfriend loooooves Red Lobster and what kind of girlfriend would I be if I didn't accompany him to his favourite restaurant now and then? He feels bad when we go though, and we hardly ever do,  because there are only 3 things I can eat at Red Lobster:  1. Mozza Sticks 2. Cheese biscuits 3. Warm Chocolate Chip Lava Cookie  You're not hearing ANY complaints from me... but clearly this isn't where I go when I'm in the middle of a detox :)  I'm told that the Endless Shrimp here is DA BOMB and the night we went, the service was GREAT. The cheese biscuits that come fresh out of the oven are reason ALONE to go, and once you've had a basket full, followed by the warm chocolate chip lava cookie, life is feelin' pretty damn good.  My only complaint is that WHY doesn't Red Lobster have at least ONE vegetarian option on their menu? They have to KNOW that some of us are willing to do whatever it takes to please our partners, and if a trip to Red Lobster is all it takes, then the least Red Lobster can do is give us something healthy to eat!"}
{"text":"Loooooove the all you can eat shrimp. Afterwards the waitress said the cook wanted to commend me for eating as much shrimp as i did. Thank you."}
{"text":"The server Larry is very rude. Interrupted us more than once. Wish I would have enjoyed my food but the service tarnished my appetite."}
{"text":"Waiting to see how good it is and the wait. It is pricy so it had better be good. Taking my woman out for mother's Day. So it had better be good. No wifi long wait for drinks the food was delicious. Only drawback was the snow crab legs had cooled off before I got them.  But otherwise everything was good. Our waitress was adaquit. Will return.  Ole."}
{"text":"This is my third time at this location and I was quite pleased with the service of our server - Christina.  She worked hard all night to make things right even thou we didn't get our orders after waiting for more than 1 hr as they ran out of salmon and the kitchen didn't notify her until later.  She made it up by buying us Lobster bisque and a dessert.  On top of that she came by to check on us and gave us more amazing biscuits.    On to the food... everything we ordered were either super salty or overdose of butter.  It was pretty nasty and I do not think I can eat the rest of my meal.  We got the 2 can dine for $30. Meal came with 2 salads - Garden or Caesar (it was pretty big).  And you get to choose 1 App or 1 dessert. We got the spicy Chicken bites. The sauce was very very spicy. Our server was kind enough to let us know so we got the sauce on the side instead.  And we get 2 entrees.  I got the Crispy fried shrimps with rice and the Shrimp pasta."}
{"text":"While I am a fan of seafood, this particular location reminds me of why I am not a fan of fast-casual chains. Upon arrival, I there was 3 hostesses working front of the house. I noticed there were a few tables in one area that were not cleared. Seemed confusing to have so many hostesses when they were obviously short-staffed with waiters.   We waited 20 or so minutes for waiters to clean the tables and make a seat available.   Once seated, our waitress seemed to be new, which is why I am providing 3 stars instead of 2. I am a reasonable person.   I ordered hot tea, as I was not feeling well. I received lukewarm water.   When the tea arrived, the waitress tipped over the lemons and proceeded to replace them in the cup with her bare hands. I requested more.   When the food arrived the portions were highly reduced. I've eaten at Red Lobster enough to know the difference. I am not a person who makes a big deal over portions, but I do want what I pay for.   Overall, the food was decent and the service was subpar. Not likely to return."}
{"text":"I was really happy with my experience at Red Lobster!   First of all  getting good service these days is about as common as finding a person that still uses VHS tapes... few and far between. Our waiter was Tanner, he was exceptional. Tanner was respectful, attentive, and quick to hook us up with refills. The other staff was kind and full of positive energy! I was very impressed! Kudos to Tanner and the Red Lobster management team.  The food was stellar! We had the blue cheese steak with a lobster tail on the side (it is Red LOBSTER after all). The steak was cooked to perfection, juicy and delicious, better than most steakhouses I've been to. The mashed potatoes were awesome and the green beans were too! Only negative was the biscuits were a bit over salted, but still really good.   I have gone here during off hours and when they are busy and the service has been consistently above average.  Bottom Line: excellent service and the food is amazing. I would recommend Red Lobster to get your feast on any day! :)"}
{"text":"Visited here tonight,  Overall pleasant experience,  Staff was very great, really enjoyed our waitress  Only negative thing was a small hair in my pasta , not a big deal I would go back"}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night. Only waited like 10-15 mins to be seated. Had an amazing waitress, endless shrimp, and a really nice time. Food was good. I have no complaints."}
{"text":"First time here and had an excellent impression of this place. I know this location has been here for years, and I finally tried it out. Food was pretty good, but the service I received from Leilani gives this place 5 stars. She was very friendly and attentive. I ordered the Seaport with Shrimp and Lobster, and the portions weren't bad at all. Along with the cheddar biscuits and salad, it definitely hit the spot. My Niece ordered a brownie sundae for dessert, and it was delicious and they give you a lot! Definitely will be coming back"}
{"text":"The wait staff was really good, two of the meals were ok but not put together correctly the third meal was straight out of a microwave. The plate was so hot you couldn't touch it the food was slimy and cold. The manager on duty came to talk with me and apologized and offered different food which I declined after knowing she didn't truly understand the problem. Oh and it's my first visit to any red lobster in 18 months and it's my birthday.  $65 for this?"}
{"text":"Endless shrimp is the bomb! Although they wouldn't stay us at a table because the servers couldn't keep up. Well that's the excuse they gave... Whatever. Guess they aren't hurting for tips! Sat at the bar. Hard to get more shrimp ordered.. That's the only drawback with the endless...."}
{"text":"I hadn't been to a Red Lobster since high school some 20 years ago. My dining companion wanted to go, though. We both love seafood, and she needed a break from our routine of sushi sushi sushi.   If this Red Lobster is any indication, they've experienced something of a massive upgrade. Gone are the days of glaring, operating-room lighting and family fast-food styled interiors. Now we have mood lighting, soft and calming; art on the walls; separate dining sections to baffle the noise of conversation; and soothing color schemes that elevate Red Lobster above its humble beginnings and into a more sophisticated family restaurant offering. Tired of McDonalds and want to offer your kids a taste of the grown-up world?  This is a good intermediary.   However, a few downsides. Our waitress was a little pushy with the recommendations, which felt like upselling. Not cool in any dining establishment. If I want recommendations, I'll ask. I want to feel like I'm dining, not shopping at the mall.   The high quality photos on the menu of food items surpassed the actual presentation so that our entrees were mildly disappointing to look at when they arrived. I wish this style would just disappear from restaurants altogether, but it definitely doesn't suit RL anymore as they work to improve their appearance. Adopt a simpler text-only menu that both looks more professional, makes it easier for customers to decide, and doesn't lead to disappointment when the food arrives, please.   The prices are somewhat steep on some items, and the drink I had (pina colada) tasted great, but there was no recognizable alcohol in it (and I'm small at 130lbs).   So, we'll go back sometime--I mean the endless delivery of biscuits is just amazing by itself--but between the prices, weak drink, upselling, and plate presentation, we won't be rushing back soon."}
{"text":"The food is so so good. I love the shrimps & the lobster. If you love seafood, that's your place ! I'll definitely go back. The only thing, it's a little bit expensive, but I still enjoyed it :)"}
{"text":"Food was awful. Lobster bisque tasted like it came out of can.  Forgot appetizer and side came out after we were 1/2 way done.  Service was equally atrocious.  We won't be returning there."}
{"text":"I went to this location and ordered steak and lobster after having a great meal at Red Lobster in Southern California.  This trip was not so good.  The lobster was tough but I managed to chew thru it.  The worst part was when I made it to the steak and found a hair on it!!!!   Grossed me out!   NEVER AGAIN!"}
{"text":"This just reminded me of why I don't go to Red Lobster.  They microwaved one of the dishes... End of story!!  Food (and I use the term loosely) was terrible."}
{"text":"1) Place-4 2) Food-4 3) Service-4 4) Light-3 5) Price-4 Total PFSLP=19 Good place for lunch. #pfslp"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed myself tonight the service was great and the food was delicious.... a special shot goes out to my server Nick Fidel he had exceptional customer service skills"}
{"text":"Great food!! Service was perfect. Our server Oliver was super friendly and always had our glasses filled.  Outstanding overall experience and the manager Andi came by and made sure everything was going well!"}
{"text":"????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????30$????????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"We decided to try out this location for the first time. First things first: the speed of service is great, both our servers were friendly (they covered each others breaks) but our servers had poor judgment.  Cleanliness wasn't up to par though, our seat had ketchup splattered all over the seat cushions, against the wall and on the carpet. Thank god I didn't sit down or else I'd have ketchup all over. When I brought this to our servers attention they wiped down the seat cushions and the wall using plain napkins but they didnt wipe the ketchup under our table on the carpet. So I placed plain napkins on the carpet for them so we don't ruin our shoes.  I'd expect the server to seat us at a different table instead of wiping the ketchup off leaving sticky residue behind for us to sit on. Plus I never got the Caeser salad that I paid for... Sadly I doubt we'll return to this location based on staff judgment and training protocol. The 3 stars are for the chef and sous chefs in the kitchen who cooked a fantastic meal!  We ordered the Boston peach ice tea(way too sweet), shrimp potstickers were tangy, sweet chilli shrimp (tasted like Cajun), the dragon shrimp was flavourful, the ultimate feast is well worth it (loved the crab legs! Lobster tail was a little over cooked, garlic shrimp was amazing, Walt shrimp wasn't good)  Dessert: key lime pie wasn't good, strawberry cheesecake was your regular cheesecake.  Coffee was ice cold, then the server told us he had a feeling that pot may have been cold, then he brought us two cups of hot coffee. All this for $111.00 plus we still tipped cuz we're good people."}
{"text":"Very impressed with the food and service at this Red Lobster.  Our server, Jenny, was awesome.  Friendly, attentive but not overbearing.  Our food was cooked perfectly and everything tastes great.  Love their shrimp scampi.  The butter garlic sauce is one of the best I've ever had.  Wonderful food and excellent service!"}
{"text":"I loved the service I received last time I was there, they kept the biscuits rolling put and they were on top of the refills and very attentive in general. I still think Red Lobster is overrated. WAY overrated and not comparable to some pf those good hole in the wall seafood spots."}
{"text":"I had read an article about the Red Lobster chain closing so i needed to visit at least one more time before that happened.  I had been to many locations of Red Lobsters but this location was a first for me.  I know it's just a little thing but I love it when they are there to open the doors for me.  We were there for an early lunch so we were seated immediately.  Erik, our waiter, walked over with his permanent smile on his face.  I only mention that because every time he came over there was a huge smile.  Fabulous!   He was a great waiter. Our drinks were never empty and very attentive to our needs.  We started off with the sweet chili shrimp.  It was perfect for us to share!  It had just enough spice with the sweet flavor of the sauce.  I loved it.  My lunch was delivered shortly thereafter.  Wood grilled shrimp tacos were calling my name.  They were full of good sized shrimp with a tangy sauce.  Three tacos seemed like almost too much but I managed to power through.  The broccoli on the side was steamed perfectly.  Overall my stomach was really happy!  This location was clean with plenty of parking.  The service and food is great! if that was my last Red Lobster visit, it was a great one!"}
{"text":"The food was cooked to perfection. Service was nothing short of 5 star. The atmosphere was warm and welcoming. We got to the restaurant at 6pm on Friday night and were seated right away. The server and front staff were just a delight. Our Friday night, date night couldn't have gone better. The manager came to our table and asked if there is anything he could do to make our night better, we had to turn him away because I don't know how you can make perfect, better. This restaurant was clean, well kept, and like I said the food was above average for a red lobster. This restaurant is well run and is highly recommended. This will be our family go to place in Calgary for above average sea food."}
{"text":"Never been to this location but it was time for us to try it via The die of course.  Once there, we asked for cold water as it was kinda hot in there, I felt like maybe they didnt have the AC cranked up high enough but no big deal, our waiter was very patient with us as we told him we had not been there before, He brought us the heavenly cheddar biscuits and the water.  I ordered Lobster bisque at the prompting of the die which instructed me to order a soup or salad and my ex had to try a margarita of the die's choice and he got a Top shelf which included a shot ot Tequilla.  Fantastic, I also ordered a mojito.  The waiter brought us more biscuits.  It was clean, service was great..  I ordered the new tilapia with lobster and it was delicious, first 3-4 bites were fantastic and I was very happy, I also ordered the new carrots and squash with bourbon butter and they were good, the carrots were a little undercooked but no big deal, the problem came from the mashed potatoes with Lobster...a couple bites and I found a very small (about the size of a dime)  hard black flat thing, it had legs/antenna.   Now...I at first told the waiter, the potatoes dont taste right and can I just have it removed from the bill but he sent the manager over and she was so nice that I had to tell her the truth, she said it was potato skin...Id buy that if I wasn't a cook myself, I have seen many overcooked potato skins and many accidentally finding their way into my food (or on purpose)   and never have I seen one with what appeared to be legs.    I truly do believe it was a roach but what can I say?     Regardless, it was a gross experience and ruined my meal, I did get the potatoes removed from the bill but it was too late for me-My ex enjoyed his meal.    I did take leftovers for the dog but I do not think we will ever return here again.     :(       Oh well, the meal was $69 and change which we both feel was a waste of money as I didnt really even eat after that and it went to waste from that moment on.    SIGH."}
{"text":"The only reason I gave them one star is that the Biscuits were good.  I was shocked when we were told that instead of having a choice of soup or salad it was just salad, or you could pay $3.00 more for a half cup of clam chowder, or $4.00 more for a \"bowl\" of soup.  I ordered the Bar harbor seafood dish, this dish was $27.00. I sent it back, the cook dumped a huge amount of raw, cold,  chopped tomatoes on top of the dish. Out of 6 mussels, only 2 were opened, no lemons were offered, no cheese, and waitress never came back to check to see how our meal was. And to make matters worse, my husband told the waitress that it was my birthday.  Worst food ever. Husbands food looked like something you would be served in a cafeteria. He had the Flounder, it was just that,  fillets of fish and a baked potato...no garnish. nothing to make it more appealing. My dish was so unappealing, and bland but the waitress never came back. Red Lobster made a lovely day bitter."}
{"text":"I used to have a great meal at red lobster till one night I went with my mom and she got the lobster and I got the stake and me and my mom got food poisoning for a 2 days"}
{"text":"Great service and food.  Place is very clean and a nice quiet family atmosphere."}
{"text":"Sat on the phone for 15 minutes waiting to find out of its open!  Why don't they have a message we are closed today? Dumb!"}
{"text":"I'm very disappointed with this location! My boyfriend and I went there for our Valentine's dinner and we were very excited to try something different. First: the hostess was extremely rude then we were sat right next to the bathroom when there was plenty of room throughout the entire restaurant. To top off our experience, our waitress never came! We were there for over 10 minutes! As we were walking out we past by 4 waitress' standing and talking. Will never go back and would recommend you don't go. Save yourself from this experience."}
{"text":"We came here for a working lunch with 5 people. The service although she was very nice was slow. Our food was also timed very poorly with half of it coming out about 10 minutes before the other half. I got the shrimp kebabs with green beans and rice. The food was good, but the shrimps were kind of on the small side. They put 2 together to make them look larger on the skewer.   The biscuits, like most people know, are the best part. What should have been a 45 minute lunch took around 1.5 hours, although the restaurant looked pretty empty."}
{"text":"Had nice dinner with my wife.  Really good waiter.  He was fantastic.  Our food was as expected and we were served promptly.  The fudge filled chocolate chip brownie was only negative, very bland."}
{"text":"Took the family to Red Lobster everyone wanted seafood got lucky and got seated right away. It is Lobsterfest right now so there are a lot seasonal choices. My wide and I both ordered Bar Harbor Bake's served over linguine in a light tomato broth with lobster, scallops, mussels and shrimp delicious but a little undercooked several of the shrimps and mussels we still closed.They are served with choice of salad. My daughter chose Salmon New Orleans topped with shrimp in a creamy creole sauce also good if some of our shellfish had not been undercooked they may have gotten 4 stars."}
{"text":"Haven't been here for some time and I was quickly and pleasantly reminded why I should not wait so long to come back. No waiting snd were quickly seated. Waiter was extremely friendly and attentive. (Just soooo rare and  nice to find!) A nice variety of choices made it hard to narrow food choices down. We settled on a two choice appetizer plate - fried mozzerla and fried calamari with vegetables. Followed by Crab Linguini Alfredo and Lobster tacos.  The famous biscuits came promptly...so warm and delicious. Surprisingly, we didn't need to ask for more since the waiter seemed to know just when to bring over new baskets full! All our food was so delicious. Cooked perfectly and absolutely no skimping on the seafood. Just perfect! There's not one negative we experienced and will definitely be returning!!!!"}
{"text":"Let me preface this by saying that I'm not a huge fan of lobster. Preposterous, I know. But I had to figure out if that Lobster & Waffle hype was real. The Lobsterfest propaganda finally worked on me. Service was polite, food came out fast, and they were surprisingly busy for a weekday lunch.    The Lobster Waffle itself was just okay: crispy lobster tail was tasty, waffle was just okay, syrup was unnecessary. I had less than half of the waffle, preferring the regular biscuits instead. In any case, I might actually come back, because I was intrigued by the lunch specials and small plates offerings."}
{"text":"I would give zero stars if I could.... my husband ordered a meal that included a soup and dessert.  The soup was brought out after his meal was served and dessert only after we asked to receive it.  Both our salads were disgusting.  The first ones were brown and wilted.  We sent those back only to receive more wilted, brown salads.  I was appalled.  We should have asked for a refund and walked out.  But we stayed only to receive our entrees. These tasted worse than overcooked Lean Cuisine tv dinners. I will never go back to ANY Red Lobster restaurant again. McDonald's would have tasted better and been 1/4 of the price.  Sad but true."}
{"text":"I have had a great servicebefore but when I went to this Red Lobster we got Anthony has our waiter and he was beyond fantastic he was at our table every 2 minutes and he was always asking us if we needed anything it was so polite if you go here I recommend Anthony p"}
{"text":"Drinks are always good but they bought us stale rolls.  The waiter gave misinformation about the dish my daughter ordered and she had to send it back. Grandkids loved their food but they are all under 8.  I had the standard broiled seafood.  Was tasteless but I was hungry and on my second cocktail.  Try to find a fresh seafood establishment on the side of the road before going here."}
{"text":"I love Red Lobster. The menu options were different and great. Unfortunately, our food came out cold but Branden W. was incredibly accommodating. Things happen but it's how management deals with a situation that makes all the difference. I will go back for sure!"}
{"text":"I love red lobster but this location has this horrible server who talks over you, gets your order wrong and when it's brought to her attention she will start talking like a game show host. I came here for my birthday and it was the worst experience because of her. Food was good once we got the correct meal. Had to talk to the manager several times. Hope she isn't there anymore. Might try again"}
{"text":"I always love the food at Red Lobster. We have enjoyed great service at this location. I love the steak and shrimp. My wife had fish tacos which were soggy, or I would have given them a five-star review. It was very pricey for soggy tacos! Biscuits were awesome as usual."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying the biscuits here are so good! I came here for the shrimp festival a few months ago. It was decent. Nothing too special, I happened to not even get anything from the shrimp festival cause nothing was appealing. My friend did however get the items and they were decent, nothing fantastic. I wouldn't really recommend this, it was your average place."}
{"text":"This is getting a two star only because our waitress was nice and attentive, it deserves a 1. The food was horrible! I got the lobster scampi pasta which was fine but my husband got the trio of crab cakes, shrimp, chicken Alfredo and added some scallops. It was all like warm and nasty."}
{"text":"I just wanted to show a little appreciation to the employees at this Red Lobster. As I sat enjoying my dinner with my children the waiter Angel was very pleasant and polite. He was very attentive and so we're the other employees working tonight. This place is very well ran. The food was great and so was the customer service."}
{"text":"My Hunny and I come here every year to celebrate his birthday. We always end up spend so much money on our meal... But I gurss thats okay because of the occasion. We had an amazing waitress who was very much on top of things without coming over every 10 minutes to interrupt (like some of these new kids) she was genuinely enjoying her job with happy and smiling though she did say she was a little tired for checking pletely understand it's hard work being a server. Food is always, atleast for us, wonderful."}
{"text":"So... not sure what to say except for disappointed. We thought we'd give Red Lobster another try and see if the new menu had gotten better. You know where this is going... We went early afternoon, in July, no crowds. Waited a few minutes until the host finally came up and said, \"2?\" No, \"sorry for waiting or how are you guys?\" Guess that was too much to ask for. We were seated and our waiter finally came around after 3 mins. Again, not crowded. I couldn't even tell you how enthusiastic he was to wait on us and be there (being sarcastic by the way). He didn't say anything about the specials, didn't refill our water until we were done with our meal, didn't ask my husband if he wanted another beer until we were done with the meal. Maybe it's too much to ask for good service? The food was nothing like the \"new revamped\" menu they advertised. Still overpriced and food was not great. We don't ask for much, just good service if possible. The food can be crappy but can be redeemed by good service. Not in this case. Good thing we had a gift card but still can't believe this was a $60 bad meal, bad experience. And if the corporate office or manager reads this review, please don't bother telling me we would love to send you a gift card and hope you have a better experience.  This experience has definitely tainted our views on restaurant chains. That's why we would rather support the local businesses Again, we would not have gone except for the gift card that we were given."}
{"text":"Came in for a late lunch during a 12 hour workday, ordered an appetizer (coconut shrimp) and a Caesar salad. Easy, right? He got the app right, but for some reason he ordered me a SIDE salad instead of a regular salad. I thought it seemed small. Oh well, I just ate extra free biscuits and left."}
{"text":"Food is what you'd expect of a Red Lobster, but what I find odd about this place is its location; it's in a REALLY ghetto part of town. But whatever, location aside, the food is alright and I would recommend Yelpers to come try out their dishes. The complimentary lobster bread or whatever it's called is really good."}
{"text":"Beaucoup d'attente pour un Lundi soir, au delà de 30 minutes. Je suis allé m'installer au bar, la dame semblait débordé, elle était quand même très sympathique mais j'ai du lui emprunter son chiffon pour essuyer la place que je venais de prendre.  Le repas, le spécial 4 services, à part la chaudrée de homard qui était très bonne, mon choix de crevettes à l'ail était très ordinaire, les brocolis étaient froid et le riz un peu sec, cette assiette n'était pas digne d'un restaurant soit disant de spécialité fruits de mer.  Je suis quand même allé plusieurs fois chez Red Lobster et c'est la première fois que je suis déçu."}
{"text":"Red lobster. You would think that since they're name is red lobster they should have pretty good seafood.   There are unlimited biscuits that you can eat during your dine in. They were freshly served as they are warm and soft. You can't eat too much as it is very oily, but nonetheless, still tasty.  I ordered the Fire Grilled Lobster Shrimp and Salmon with broccoli and the roasted potatoes as sides. The shrimp was pretty good, very flavourful and the texture was fresh. But then everything else just kept going downhill. The broccoli was frozen broccoli, the roasted potatoes tasted like they were baked, put into the oven, frozen and rebaked and was put into the microwave. It was way too dry and tasted very starchy. It was also way too salty. The lobster tail was the end. It wasn't fresh as the meat was kind of mushy in texture. As for the salmon, it was pretty dry. For something that the waitress recommended, I would've thought it would've been made better.   We also ordered the four course meal that is only available from Mon-Thurs. You get to choose a soup, a salad, an entree, and a dessert for $22. We chose the clam chowder soup, Caesar salad, shrimp linguine and the brownie. Another set, we chose the chicken linguine. The soup and salad weren't bad, but the pasta was very mediocre. The brownie was also pretty good.   However, what made this experience terrible was the server. Prior to us ordering, she was friendly and gave us recommendations since it was our first time here. After we ordered, she barely came to our table unless it was to give us the food. Often times we needed our water to be refilled, and she didn't bother to glance at our table. Near the end after our entree, she even asked us if we would like our desserts packed up to be taken out. We never told her to pack it for us. Not only was her attitude towards us very negative, she seemed to be opinionated towards our food choices and wanted us out asap. I won't reveal her name, but I definitely won't be back.   In terms of food and service, I've definitely experienced better."}
{"text":"Stopped here with my family on the way back from Canton, Ohio on Good Friday.  It was mid-afternoon and crowded.  We were seated promptly and our server Dan was right on top of things with drinks and our seafood orders. It was a very pleasant experience.  Will go back again if in the area."}
{"text":"So my boyfriend and I stopped here for lunch, while we were ordering the waitress seemed lost when I asked her what certain dishes came with and she even grabbed a menu and started reading it out loud to us. We figured she was new so we disregarded it. We didn't get our biscuits until our salads were out which was like 10-15 mins later. My boyfriend is allergic to shrimp so he ordered the sirloin steak PLAIN, we were very clear about that. Our food comes out and there's shrimp on his steak. The waitress that brought the food was not our original waitress so we told her about his allergies and she went back. We were upset since we had to wait again, from the looks of it we were the only table that certain waitress had. LUCKILY, the manager Jimmy came and addressed our concerns and handled the situation immediately. He apologized and even took my boyfriend's meal off the check. After the bad service we were not thinking about going to go back there but thanks to Jimmy we will be back."}
{"text":"it was ok but most of the food all starts to taste the same.   I like lobster at Outback much better sorry Red Lobster"}
{"text":"I am honestly quite confused about all the horrible reviews for this place.  Everyone was helpful and friendly from the hostesses to the waiters.  Sean waited on us and was incredibly polite and couldn't have been better.  We received exceptional service and got all our food orders quickly and tasting great."}
{"text":"Dined here last night for hubbys bday and was very disappointed.....service was ok but the food was below standard. He had the stuffed mushrooms and I dont know how they stuffed them they were so tiny, I had the artichoke dip and it was just warm.  As I work in the food industry  I realise most food comes pre-prepared. The dippers were soggy....main meal..hubby had the seafood trio and his lobster was dry and chewy, shrimp cold.  I had the admirals feast which was soaked in oil and tasteless......oh and the garden salad lol lots n lots of lettuce 2 cherry tomatoes no cucumber minimal dressing. Had to ask for tomatoes and cucumber. Oh and the biscuits got served with the main meal....guess our server forgot them Will be calling corperate as this was the most tasteless dining experience I have had at this red lobster........very disappointed, but just another restaurant chain I guess....oh just for an fyi I work in the food industry...as a server and I would have expected more!!!!!"}
{"text":"Ok, I realize this is a chain restaurant, however, I haven't eaten here since Darden sold Red Lobster, and I thought it would have changed for the better and not for the worse. My wife got the shrimp Alfredo, I can't believe any respectable seafood restaurant uses salsa shrimp in shrimp Alfredo. I got the Cajun chicken Alfredo, and there was absolutely nothing Cajun about it. The cheddar bay biscuits that made red lobster, red lobster, I can make better!!!! The only reason they received 1 star was because I couldn't give them less!!!"}
{"text":"This place was gross. Dark, dirty, unwelcoming... and that was just the building. The food was oily and tasteless, despite having probably a week's worth of butter and salt in it.  The prices are worthy of far better food. Do yourself a favor and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Had a really great date night. The food was good and the atmosphere was good! My husband and I had really great service by Marco (I think his name was) we got extra crab legs and our dessert was great as well!"}
{"text":"You know when you start saying a word too many times and it starts sounding weird? Well in this review, it's going to be \"salt\". If I were to describe the meal in one word... SALTY! I ordered the 4 course meal for $21.99 (offered Monday-Thursday) and had to take home leftovers because it was too much for me to handle in the restaurant.  First, the biscuits. Everyone raves about them and how great they are, so I had some pretty high expectations! They were soft, hot, and salty (but bearable.) Not bad when chased down with a class of water.  Next, the appetizer - Boston Clam Chowder. I'd say the cup size is probably your best bet because the salt threw off my appetite, and I came in feeling hungry. Maybe even skip out on it. This was probably the worst, even our server apologetically agreed as he had heard the same complaint from other customers.   Caesar salad was probably the light of the meal. It was the only point where I thought I wasn't being attacked by a sodium bomb.   Coconut jumbo shrimp was pretty good, it came with a side of fries. A bit too much to stomach after the soup though. Crunchy and deep fried, but was offset by the pleasantly sweet coconut dip. Recommended.  Dessert was a brownie with a scoop of ice cream.   Our server was great! Very friendly and made sure to check if our table was doing alright (but not pestering us as I've experienced at other restaurants.) I'm giving this two stars because the customer service was great and the atmosphere was generally pleasant."}
{"text":"This has only been my 2nd time at a Red Lobster EVER. It was ok. I have had better seafood elsewhere. The biscuits were by far the star of the show.   We were seated quickly for a Friday night and the server was fine.  The seafood was a little undercooked and everything was dripping in butter. Don't get me wrong, I LOVE butter but  sometimes too much of a good thing can ruin a meal. The shrimp were TINY and the Lobster Tail was TINY  It was pricey too considering we had 2 Childrens Entrées. The kids mac and cheese was Kraft. Sort of a joke really. $5,99 for Mac and Cheese from a box. When are restaurants going to get a clue and offer more than chicken fingers and mac and cheese on the kids menu? Some kids do have an adventurous spirit and will eat real food.  I may go back for a lunch and their biscuits but will probably pass on them for dinner."}
{"text":"my server was no services at all, after drink and food order, not even come check on my table. once the food brought out, but wrong order. she was not say any word about the wrong order. or let you know is she gonna put in the new order and how long gonna be take."}
{"text":"Had the shrimp and lobster.  It was OK.  The salad was fresh.  The rolls were hot and tasty.  The lobster was kind of dry.  The shrimp scampi was kind of mushy.  The baked potato was OK.  All in all, it was OK, but not great.  The service was initially good, but then it took forever to get our second order of drinks."}
{"text":"Wonderful food & drinks + excellent waiter (Jason C) = a great time!  We went in tonight to celebrate and celebrate we did.  Thank you Red Lobster, for living up to our idea of a special date night.  Recommending to everyone!!"}
{"text":"I have not been to a Red Lobster in awhile but the quality of the food has gone down. It is not as good as it use to be. Maybe this is why they are losing money. Cutting corners is not working especially if you are raising the prices of the meals"}
{"text":"Sunday night dinner, thanks to a gift card I had been holding onto for a special occasion. Well Sunday night is special enough with the work week ahead! We walked in at around 8:45pm and it was surprisingly busy.  We waited about 10 minutes to be seated. Our waitress was new, but she tried hard to get everything right, in which she did, I ordered hot tea, and didn't get a reserve of hot water, not until another waitress took over midway. Other than that the food was hot and flavored well. Definitely have leftovers!!"}
{"text":"Service was good. Staff was friendly and outgoing.  The food quality of the chain has really suffered for the last several years.  Disappointing because I really liked this chain."}
{"text":"I probably ate here more than 30 x . Love the shrimp trio . Its nice that you can always substitute sides or the shrimp like what I do. Im a very picky eater. The staff is very friendly and nice . They give you two drinks right away which is good so that your not waiting for refills . Oh did I mention the free yummy biscuits !!! And if you ask for more they will give u a fresh one to go! The price for me is affordable for the goodness  you get. The appetizers are great especially the lobster and artichoke. That is a must!!! We order it all the time. Not a fan of the calamari here it comes with fried broccoli. The dinner comes with either salad or soup . So i think that the money you spent is worth it. The menu is incredible lots of choices .. love coming back here !"}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few times with no problem but this will most likely be the last time the service was so bad it was comical. It took about 15 mins just to get someone to take our order and an eternity for our food to come out when they finally brought it out it was incomplete one of us had ordered the salmon crab and lobster plate and it had no salmon...it was irritating but at least we finally had some of our meal 15 minutes later a woman having a very loud conversation with someone across the restaurant comes out with the salmon she swings around to laugh with her friend I had to dodge the plate as she spun and then she tossed literally just dropped the plate on the table and left without saying a word or even looking our direction! So then my date had to arrange the plate himself so he can at least eat his food together....after that or server never checked back in till the end...my dates food had little shell bits all through it and my medium rare steak was absolutely the most rare steak I've ever been served I didn't eat it for health concern reasons it was basically a seared on the sides and that was it absolutely nauseating to top that off the squash weren't cooked at all so I had a 40 dollar plate of mashed potatoes in the end when the server finally came back he asked if I needed a box (lol) I let him no how dissatisfied we were and he basically just stared at me and mumbles sorry......i should have asked for a manager but i doubt they'd of been very helpful in the end we obviously won't be back"}
{"text":"Red Lobster is one of my guilty pleasures that I hate to love.   SERVICE: Service here was awesome. We got a sweet gal named \"Shay\". It was short for something else, but I can't remember her full name for the life of me. Anyways, she definitely made the experience. We did the endless shrimp special and without her attentive service, the special would have been difficult to enjoy.   Darden's game with these endless specials is to have a ghost server that doesn't offer refills enough for the special to be worth your money, but that was not the case with this lady. She checked in constantly to fulfill my insatiable need for shrimp.   FOOD: Buttery, fattening, and salty. So like, really good. The new Parmesan peppercorn shrimp and the Korean BBQ were really good. I continued to get those. Personally, my heart lies with the Parmesan shrimp.   And of course the cheesy bread was awesome. We took some more to go.   DRINKS: The old fashioneds here are simple and to the point. Well done, on the bartenders part. Certainly not the noisiest OF I've ever had, but it gets the job done."}
{"text":"The food was okay but the restaurant stinks. Literally, it smells. Upon entering, the bathrooms are immediately to the left of the entrance and they stink up the whole front section of the restaurant. During my wait to be seated, the strong smell of cleaning chemicals and human waste almost ruined my appetite. Luckily, my husband and I were seated in the back so this wasn't much of a problem during our meal.   Our waitress was very polite and attentive. However, I couldn't help but notice that there wasn't much of a concern for cleanliness in any of the employees. When our waitress brought out our napkins, there were crumbs all in the napkins. Instead of replacing them, she said, \"that's from the biscuits.\" Ok, but for all I know, that could be from someone else's old biscuit basket. Another employee brought out our plates and there were items hanging off the plates, touching the trays. This was served to us without any hesitation. Other unsanitary incidents occurred that I won't go into detail. I understand that this is a little nit-picky, but my husband ended up getting sick after this dinner and we can't help but wonder the reason why.   For food, he ordered coconut shrimp and I ordered crab legs. It all tasted alright, but you can't really go wrong with steaming crab legs and refrying frozen coconut shrimp.   I've had better experiences at other Red Lobsters so I'm not totally against this seafood chain. This location, however, I am not a fan."}
{"text":"This place is usually busy but well staffed. We come here often but usually only around all you can eat shrimp. We love trying the differemt and new shrimp flavors. The re-orders arrive quickly and you can immediately place another order. Also.. cheddar bay biscuits, what else is there to say?"}
{"text":"The food is great. The good thing about chain restaurants is it's (usually) consistent quality. Services here is ALWAYS hit or miss. Sometimes we'll get a super attentive and dedictated server, and other times we'll get someone we need to physically track down every time we need something.   Cesar salad -- soooo good. Probably my favorite cesar from any restaurant. Weird, I know. Cheddar Bay biscuits - warm mounds of garlic-buttery heaven Crab stuffed mushrooms - awesome appetizer (or order as part of their build your own) Coconut shrimp - my favorite thing to order here. The pina colada dipping sauce is really what seals the deal"}
{"text":"Excellent!  I haven't been to a Red Lobster in literally YEARS!! We had recently ate at a \"high end\" sea food place in town, with an unbalanced product:value ratio. Red Lobster was a refreshing surprise at a fraction of the price.   GF had a gift card, so we popped in during Lobster Fest. Everything, and I mean EVERYTHING was great!!  We were quoted 45 minutes for a table and were seated in 20. Every point of contact was polite, but casual. The biscuits are everything I was promised, the specialty cocktails are delightful, and specials really covered all tastes.  I got two, perfectly cocked and wonderfully seasoned lobster tails.   GF had the Surf & Turf which she said was great, but wouldn't let me taste, as she was too excited to eat it herself. (j/k, she reads these)  If I had to lodge a complaint:  The water in the bathroom sink gets hot too fast.  We had an very good mean, with great service, for literally 1/3 of what we paid at a fine dining, sea food specific establishment (see next review)."}
{"text":"Food was great and in large amount! The bread they serve was Yummy and you can have as many pieces as you want. Worth price and definitely worth going! The waiter was so friendly and warm hearted! Pleasant experience!"}
{"text":"My husband was brought out pasta with mussels. The plate was filled with liquid & mussels weren't open. They were either dead or not cooked long enough. Scary that the cook didn't know enough to realize a huge error. Reordered surf & turf. He couldn't even cut into steak it had so much fat & gristle. Second bad experience here. If you are getting fried food might be ok. We will never eat here again."}
{"text":"Bad service, we had to wait 2 hrs to get table. Waiter came over 30mins after we sit down. Bad music too."}
{"text":"Took FOREVER to get our drink orders and food orders. The Excuse was that they sat us at the wrong table. As I was typing this review, the floor manager asked if we had been helped."}
{"text":"Here's the thing about Red Lobster: you know what you're getting yourself into when you step beyond those doors. This is your typical lower end chain seafood restaurant, trying so desperately to be relevant anymore that it's sickening.  I ended up at this joint because someone in my extended family wanted to go here for her birthday dinner. With 10 of us. Ugh.  While I was waiting for other to arrive in front of the restaurant, a server and someone from the kitchen walked up. They stopped about 10 feet from me. I could hear their (overly loud) conversation perfectly. They were looking at a phone and talking about \"sucking on them f******* ti***es.\" Completely inappropriate, considering there were other guests all around.   Next up, we get to our table. The servers were very polite and seemed to be on point, which is a nice surprise to find in a place like this. Halfway during everyone's salads, some obnoxious overly-cocky d-bag of a food runner comes up with his tray and tries to auction off entree items. First of all, if you see we are still eating salads, go screw yourself, dude. Second of all, you had like 3 entrees for 10 of us. Third of all, when we tell you no one ordered those items, perhaps you should believe us instead of arguing with us until our server comes and directs you to the correct table. Yikes.  Salads leave, CORRECT entrees come. The food here all tastes the same. The steak is poor quality (what do you expect from an Olive Garden-esque seafood restaurant?) The shrimp all taste the same. The king crab is waterlogged. Everything is just \"meh.\" All tastes like greasy, buttery, garlicky goo. Everything. Literally. Yes, really. The saving grace here is probably the cheddar biscuits, which are delicious, but again, like eating a stick of butter.  Entrees leave. Desserts come. Yay! Happy Birthday. They have this \"innovative\" thing where they serve the dessert in a mason jar. Listen up, Red Lobster: not only is it not innovative, it only \"kind of\" works when you actually have employees that LAYER the items in the jar carefully and take the extra time to make it look nice. It looked like a hot mess; like someone took the frozen red velvet sheet cake from Sysco and broke it up into 3 inch chunks and stuffed it in the jar. Ick.  The most humorous part of this visit for me was watching someone drop whipped cream all over the ground to the side of our table. I watched, and I only wish I was exaggerating here, 10 people, INCLUDING MANAGERS, walk by and LITERALLY move their head down to see the myriad of whipped cream on the floor, and continue to do NOTHING about it. HA! I was laughing out loud at the absolute ineptitude and lack of caring among everyone in this restaurant.   I can only imagine the soul-dying that not only happens when you dine here, but when you work here. I heard Darden is trying to get rid of this concept and unload it, which from watching the s**tshow in this place, makes complete sense. Just to be clear, however, our servers were VERY positive, VERY friendly, and did a great job (other than not cleaning up whipped cream.) It's just everything else about this place that makes me... well... Seafood Differently."}
{"text":"Wait times are long , food is expensive , food isn't even that great , crispy food is soggy, slow service and a little rude. They don't give military discount either.  Would I recommend ? No . Go again? Never."}
{"text":"Best Biscuits ever! The food was tasty! My favorite is the Bar Harbor Lobster Bake!! Yum! Our server was attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"We went on the busiest day possible and so the wait time was an hour and a half. We decided to wait it out.   There are plenty of seats to sit at while you wait to be called. Our wait time turned out to be more like an hour and the hostess took us to our table.   Our server was very friendly and attentive even though the place was a madhouse. We ended up ordering a few different plates since we were a pretty big party.  What we ordered:  One artichoke and lobster dip One order of mozzarella sticks One potato soup One steak entree with mashed potatoes and a house salad  One order of the three shrimp tacos that came with one side and a salad.   Every entree came with a salad and the entrees are very big. You will have leftovers!   The food was great! The potato soup is delicious and of course so are the cheddar biscuits!  Our server was the best!"}
{"text":"We had dinner here a few weeks ago because I craved for it so badly. Prior to that, it had been a few years since I last visited. They renovated - an addition to the front of the building. It was nice.  We arrived during their peak hours so a wait was expected. It wasn't too long though, about 15-20 minutes, and the weather was nice at the time so we just hung out on the bench outside.  Our waitress was very friendly, attentive and never left us alone for too long to ensure our drinks were filled and to take any other orders we may have had. The food was sooo yummy! Totally hit the spot and satisfied my craving.   I had the Lobster Lover's Dream and my boyfriend chose the Fire-Grilled Sirloin Surf & Turf for our main meals. For sides, we had the Lobster & Shrimp Mac 'N' Cheese, Escargot and Seafood-Stuffed Mushrooms. My only wish was to have had more room in my tummy because I wanted to eat more than I was able to but I had to be smart about my \"plan of attack\" to make sure I could have a bit of everything. IT WAS ALL ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS! Mm! I loved every bite and I hope to be just as pleased with the experience when we visit again in the future."}
{"text":"Food is ok ok type.but 3 star because they definitely need more room perfume. When u enter, a weird smell just got stuck to your nose and remains entire time.."}
{"text":"Last time I was here about 4 months ago everything was fine and decent. You really can't go wrong with fried shrimp.   Girlfriend got the lobster tail which was ok but seemed alittle over cooked but with more butter it wasnt as bad. But as the dinner was about to end I found the most grossest pubic look hair under a popcorn shrimp. I almost threw up. The waiter was very helpful and he removed my item from the bill and the manager apologized which I didn't ask for.   So customer was good there. 1 star for that and another for the yummy biscuits. I also still tipped what the original amount would have been because the server was pretty awesome.   But I have to say this is my last time to red lobster. Not cuz of the hair but because of the mediocre food."}
{"text":"It's been awhile since we've been to Red Lobster and I have to tell you that this location on 75th Avenue was very impressive our server Kaitlyn provided everything that we needed in then some suggestions on the menu and also provide a great service.  Very impressed with that atmosphere of the area and also the food they have extensive menu which changed the first time but it's very excellent right now it's the Lobster Fest and I believe it'll be in them either. At the end of this month or next month so we partake than that which was awesome various items on there with lobster and shrimp dinners to please any palette.  Make sure you get time to go ahead and visit this location as the atmosphere is great and very convenient to get to our server was very great and gracious making sure that she attended to every need that we had.  I look forward to going back and visiting this establishment again in the near future."}
{"text":"Our group of 12 called ahead for seating.  Red Lobster is not the restaurant for a group of 12.  We were told we would be seated at separate tables, but it would be \"o.k.\"  It was not.  we were told we could not push the tables together and that we could not have the back room.  Our November gathering was a lot to be desired.  All agreed we have been accommodated easily at other places and we'll leave Red Lobster off the list for future gatherings.  Linda C."}
{"text":"Ordered twenty shrimps. Got nineteen shrimps instead!!! I am outrage. Green beans all over the floor. Bathrooms smell like the Axe body spray. I will never bring my pet parakeet here AGaain. UGH!!!"}
{"text":"I went for lunch today. I went for the endless shrimp. I had the Cajun spicy, scampi, & Alfredo with pasta. All 3 delicious. My Mom had the snow crab. When she was having trouble cracking the crab & our server Kristen asked if she could crack them & remove the crab for my Mother. She went & got  gloves & cracked all the snow crab. Kristen went above & beyond the call of duty. She was great in answering all our questions when we first sat down. Service was great & when I come back I'd request Kristen to take care of me again"}
{"text":"Our server, Christine, is simply amazing. Very attentive, entertaining, and very good at her job. I will contiue to go back to this location and I will contiue to ask for her as my server. The food is great, don't get me wrong, bur the amazing service and the fun I have laughing with Chritine is why I keep going back."}
{"text":"Don't go to any other red lobster in Vegas. This is the best one in town because of a server named Sydney. She hooked it up for us ! The endless shrimp was never ending, gave us more then we could even handle.Will definitely be coming back because of her :)"}
{"text":"If I was able to give this place zero stars, then that's what they would get. My husband, toddler and I arrived at the restaurant around 7:15 and expected a wait being that it was a Saturday night. The wait was 45 minutes, which was expected. After receiving our pages we waited the allotted time, then went to check the status and were told we were 3rd in line and should be any minute. We were given that line 3 times by the four confused hostess' in the front. Fast forward to 9:00 pm, when my husband checked again we were told that we were skipped in the line. When the hostess told the head hostess that she skipped over us her response was, \"my bad\". We then had to wait another 10 minutes before we were seated. We sat and was greeted by a very nice waiter, he took our order and drinks and vanished. He arrived 10 minutes later with our drinks but forgot our bread and salads. Another 20 minutes later our entrees arrived, still no bread or salads. We inquired about salad and he said, \"oh I forgot about the salads and here's some bread\". The food was horrible, I ordered the Ultimate Feast which was cold and the lobster was over cooked and hard, the crab legs are cold and obviously old. My husband ordered the Roasted Main Lobster Bake, which was overcooked lobster in overcooked pasta with a watered down butter sauce, that was supposed to be a white wine sauce. The tomatoes were dreadful. My daughters macaroni and cheese was literally Kraft from the box but not as good. That was the breaking point with us, my husband spoke to the manager on duty, who was dressed sloppy and addressed many of the customers as \"boo\". The manager  seemed sincere about the problems we experienced and gave us the \"family discount\" which was $16 off our $80 bill and we still did not receive our ordered salads. Needless to say, we will never visit this establishment again, the combination of excessive wait times, lack of staff competence and horribly disgusting, over priced food there is no reason to even drive through the parking lot."}
{"text":"This location has only been open for about 6 weeks. I agree with Walter W. that the entrance is reallllly in the cut.  Well, it is more stylish than the Pineville location and more smiling faces.  The service is also better for now and hope they keep it up. The $10 FB promotion was enough to get us through the doors and as crowded as it was(people were waiting outside) more than just I love a deal.  The food was tasty and biscuits hot & delicious. Our server Zac provided some of the best RL service we have had in years. He kept a smile, was knowledgeable about the menu and a biggie for me-- anticipated our table's needs.  It irks me to flag down my server to get a refill, napkins, take away plates, etc.  One gripe would be they were quoting tables 45-50 minutes on Sat evening at 8pmish. In the dining room, we could see many booths& tables not bussed. Maybe if they keep their busboys on top of things, they will not have those long waits. We guests prefer to wait at table.Hint: we may be more inclined to order an appetizer/drinks while waiting.  Not a 5 star dinner nor the  best seafood in the land, but it will have your belly full of a decent & affordable  (insert coupon) meal."}
{"text":"Long wait ok service good thing they have the ultimate feast otherwise I would never come:"}
{"text":"We decided to go after Church last Sunday.  It wasnt that busy, which was nice.   We tried the Lobster dip as an appetizer and it was just ok.. not amazing.  I do have to say that I love the cheese biscuits and popcorn shrimp.  So for that very reason I will prob go back.  The last time I was there .. was years and years ago."}
{"text":"This place is not on my favorite to eat spot because of my detest of seafood but our waiter Caleb definitely made it into one of my top 10! He was such a great server and a nice guy! I'll come back for the service (and brownie) alone! Thanks so much! Look at the super cute brownie picture I posted :)"}
{"text":"Went here as a group of 5. The waitress was nice and drinks and appetizer orders were taken and promptly brought out. The mozzarella sticks were subpar. The biscuits were excellent. I ordered a steak and lobster tail. The steak was well well done and i ordered it medium well. Another steak at the table was also over cooked. They offered to remake them, but i never like to send food back and we declined.   I had a beer that was empty for a period of time and no waitress to ask about another. The lobster was good and someone at my table had the coconut shrimp and they really liked them! Overall it was expensive and the food when prepared right was pretty good.  We would go back probably once a year but no more than that."}
{"text":"Shane was awesome and accommodating. He offered biscuits, but the biscuits came out late after we were full. He packed it up for us still keeping his word. Also the chef was nice enough to redo our pasta because the chef claimed it was over cooked. One of the best experiences at a restaurant with awesome people working!"}
{"text":"Was a very nice evening dining experience. I got the large feast and was absolutely satisfied. Just wish the lobster would have been bigger (I love lobster). Service was right on everything from the drinks to keeping up with items needed for our table."}
{"text":"We sat at the bar. Justin & Jacob were our servers  they love what they do and work together as a team   Justin completely shelled a lobster for a big table teaching a little girl how to do that.  Never seen that before.  These two guys made our evening The place is really nice and we will go again"}
{"text":"The lobster tail was salty. The crab legs were alright. The shrimp was awesome. The asparagus was amazing. All in all it was eh."}
{"text":"It was my sis' and my first time at a red lobster. The cheddar bay biscuits brought us here. We came on a Thursday afternoon and it wasn't too busy.  Before reviewing the food I want to give a big shout out to our server Brandon. Normally I don't remember servers' names unless they do a phenomenal job to make themselves memorable despite the quality of food. Brandon was excellent, very attentive to all his tables, bussed his own tables on his own, refilled bisquits without even asking, gave us everything we needed for our meal such as the utensil to break the crab legs and towelettes, checked up on us frequently to see we were doing okay and even packed up our food to-go on his own so neatly and carefully! He made sure to offer dessert to all his tables too.  I feel this man needs the recognition for his hard work. It's hard to find someone who enjoys seeing his guests/customers satisfied with their dining.  anyways, it took a while for our server to greet us but he was busy at the moment so it wasn't a big deal.  We decided on the Ultimate Feast, clam chowder and lobster bisque.   The bisquits and lobster bisque were on the salty side and contrary to one review on here, there WERE lobster pieces in my soup. Brio's version is still better to me. The clam chowder was just straight up creamy, nothing special. I wish there was some seasoning that bumped up the flavor.  The ultimate feast was more than enough to share for two people. I have to say though, eating seafood gets tiring. I cannot have too much fiber in my diet and was saddened that they didn't offer plain white rice to eat the seafood with, just a brown rice pilaf. The two sides we decided on were sweet mashed potatoes with caramelized pecans and mashed potatoes that had no gravy on it ): needless to say the mashed potatoes did not go well with our meal lol  Overall, our experience was great but the food wasn't memorable to come back"}
{"text":"Ummm wow.  I wrote a quick tip that said \"who cares about a rating, the biscuits are the business!\"... I was wrong! Let me explain why.  First, the 3 hosts(why do you need 3 hosts?) told us that it would be a 15 minute wait. It turned into 30.  We didn't mind cuz all we can think about were the biscuits!  When we finally got seated it took a little while for our \"seafood expert\" to actually come and take our drink order, but that's cool cuz all we can think about were the biscuits!  We placed our order immediately an then we expressed to her that we love and want lots of biscuits, cuz all we can think about were the bicuits! She says \"ok, there getting ready to pop out of the oven!\" we wait patiently for them to \"get out of the oven\".  Our salad comes... no biscuits, our dinners come.. still NO biscuits! We ask the food runner if we can get some biscuits, he says \"they're still cooking in the oven.\" Ummmm STILL NO BISCUITS!   We seen several other tables get their biscuits as soon as they sat down.  I guess our waitress sucked ass, big time.    Red Lobster, your waitress, Porsche delivered the worst service in all history of waitressing, fire her ASAP!"}
{"text":"I ordered fries with my kids meal at red lobster and the were green and weirdly looked like trees. I don't know if they were old, raw, or what was happeing but i was not pleased with the taste."}
{"text":"Where  do I begin? Slow service and overly greasy food. Prices are ridiculous. I don't know who would want to wait more than 15 minutes for a seat in this place. My husband and I would rather go out to Brennan's or Pickle Bills then wait for a table at this establishment."}
{"text":"Not too bad for a red lobster  The service was good and the food was what you would expect from a red lobster. Our server Justin Is as very attentive and made sure our drinks were always filled and we never ran out of biscuits. I have had bad experiences with Red Lobster but decided to again give them a try and I was surprised on how much I actually liked it."}
{"text":"Tried to have the Endless Shrimp for a late lunch, but the server never came by my table. I watched servers walk by and not even make a peep. I left after more than five minutes of waiting for acknowledgement. The bad part was it was not even busy..."}
{"text":"Mediocre at best! Go for the appetizers and skip the mains.. Not the best, not even close, but if you stick to the appetizers and avoid the mains, you might not notice.  It is hard to get good seafood in Toronto, this place proves it."}
{"text":"This location usually has good service. I have been coming here for over 15 years for birthdays, work lunches etc.   A few times I went with my husband and he got Endless Shrimp and I didn't cause I can't eat that much. I got my own entree, during our meal the waitress popped up out of no where and said \"if you eat any of his shrimp I'm gonna have to charge you full price for the endless shrimp\" which is about $30. It was pretty embarrassing and I honestly didn't eat any of his shrimp, even if I ate 1 is that a reason to charge me $30 on top of the $20 my meal is costing?!? I thought maybe it was just that one waitress but it happened another time with a male waiter. I think it might have been because my husband simply eats so much so fast and they didn't believe he did it alone. Regardless that was extremely unpleasant both times being threatened while eating my meal, I felt scared as though I was being watched or something.  Next time I went we both got Endless Shrimp for $30, they took so long to bring out eat round (your only allowed to order 2 at a time) we grew tired of waiting, they also give you salad, fries and bread to fill you up. Overall i think it's a rip-off and all the shrimp they include are the tiny cheap ones with a different sauce that doesn't even taste that good. Over the years the price of endless shrimp goes up and their quality of shrimp goes down.   I would recommend getting the lunch specials if you're there during the week ($10-$15), 4-course feast for dinner which includes dessert ($18.99) or Create your own combo by choosing 2 of your favourites for $21.99.  When my husband and I go, we get one appetizer usually the lobster stuffed mushrooms ($9.99) which are AMAZING and the create your own combo ($21.99) with 2 orders of their butterfly coconut shrimp, this comes with their pineapple sauce, fries and a salad along with your unlimited cheddar bay biscuits. This fills us both up right to rim with no left overs. Much cheaper alternative to each person getting a full meal and taking it home."}
{"text":"Outstanding food at a fair price on small plates but with a ridiculous drink catch - one at a time - really  the idea of just one drink at a time in Las Vegas at first offended me and then sounded so stupid.  The staff was very pleasant but management needs to learn the laws of Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Having shocked all my coworkers when I confessed that I've never been to a Red Lobster, they insisted that we dedicate our lunch hour to my first experience. I've never been a big fan of seafood, so I was hesitant to go.   We were seated promptly, our food was brought to the table sooner than would be expected, and the meal was actually quite good. Our server was attentive and quick to bring refills on drinks and rolls (which was love at first bite).   I enjoyed the ambiance as it reminded me of my younger years growing up on the coast of Maine. Overall a good experience."}
{"text":"The service here is outstanding and if you are not satisfied they will make sure you come back. Won't go anywhere else for fish and our family go mainly for the shrimp. Renovated not that long ago and the place is big. Worth the drive from anywhere in the GTA."}
{"text":"We had a fantastic experience here. The food was great, the service was excellent and he atmosphere was very relaxed. Will definitelyly come again!"}
{"text":"Never been a huge fan of Red Lobster. Of course the prized cheddar biscuits are great but nothing else really stood out about this visit specifically. Overall the experience wasn't bad, food just left more to be desired. The shrimp dish pictured below needed an additional side of Alfredo because it was simply too dry. The better dish out of the two was the grilled chicken dish with rice pilaf, broccoli and mashed potatoes. I know right, who goes to Red Lobster and orders a non seafood dish! I did, and surprisingly it was the better dish out of the two."}
{"text":"The WORSE experience ever...writing upper management as soon as I get home...three hours of hell"}
{"text":"After seeing all the pictures of the food on TV, we decided to go check them out. We arrived about 4:45. Out timing was great by 6:00 there was waiting inside and out.  We got seated at a table near the bar which was ok you could watch the game if you wanted to.  Our Server was Steven he was very nice and helpful as I was downloading the app. He took the time to ask me if I had any questions about it. He explained some of the plates on the menu. We ended up getting Admirals Feast and Bar Harbor Lobster Bake. Both dishes were very good.  Our Server Steven was the best."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here because we were missing the seafood back home. We knew it wouldn't be as fresh as Maine since it does have to be frozen for travel, but this was awful. The food actively smelled rancid and tasted rotten. I couldn't even eat part of my meal. My husband who will eat pretty much anything only ate about a quarter of his meal. The only reason they get two stars is because the waitstaff was very nice and professional."}
{"text":"Friday was my husband and I first time here and everything was delicious! Our waitress was very nice and taught my hubby how to eat crab legs. The tilapia stuffed with lobster was soo good. Will return for more."}
{"text":"Poor service attitude and very impatient. Need better training and management.  Cocktails taste terrible"}
{"text":"For the most part, we've had some great experiences here. There are some great members of the staff who are pretty down to earth and down to make a good tip. Jeff and Mikel are awesome. The managers are also helpful and understanding if you need them. Food is always on par or better.  I've only had a couple of bad experiences, both were during the day and both were with females at the bar. Sitting here today, at least half the people who headed to the bar to sit and eat asked who was working, so this may be a common issue.  The biscuits, lobster pizza and lobsterita typically make it worth the visit."}
{"text":"This is a biased review because I don't like seafood.  I know right, WTF?  Going to a seafood place when I don't like seafood.  Well I came here because my wife loves seafood and I wanted to take her someplace of her choice.  They do have some non-seafood dishes.  I ordered some pizza with chicken on it.  It was pretty good, but the special sauce on it was a little overpowering.  My wife and son both enjoyed their meals, and the service was very good.  I just dislike the smell of seafood, so sitting there was rough for me, but that's the price of making the family happy sometimes..lol"}
{"text":"Yikes, it's fitting that this is a seafood spot, because this restaurant is a sinking ship.  My coworker was hungry and wanted some soup, so I agreed to go to lunch with her. We arrived at around 12:30 on a Tuesday, the parking lot was half full.  We were greeted right away, and shown to our booth. A friendly server greeted us and took our drink orders. Coming back with the drinks, the server (Allison, I think?) did a good job of explaining the menus, showing us the specials etc. The server provided a really good impression that things were going to be very good.  My friend and I ordered lunch, she ordered the salad/soup combo and I ordered the breaded shrimp lunch (way to branch out, I know...) Our server brought us some tasty rolls, and was quick to refill our drink glasses. After about 25 minutes, our server again came over to check on us, and it looked like she was surprised to see the absence of plates on our table. The server returned to our table with more rolls and told us it would be a few more minutes.  My friend commented that it had taken forever for our food to arrive, and I could not disagree with her. I could see a long delay if we ordered some intricate dish, which was complex and required time (calzones, etc) but soup is already made, salad is just lettuce and dressing, and my entire lunch required mere minutes in a deep fryer.  About ten minutes later our lunches arrived, and we were both truly puzzled as to what could have possibly taken so long. The place was not full at all, so it wasn't that the kitchen got overwhelmed- I really don't know the disconnect.  I do not blame the server for the kitchen having epic failures. I do wish she would have stopped by and acknowledged the issue. Tell me anything:  \"Hey, the kitchen lost your order, they're making it now.\"  \"Sorry, there was a knife accident in the kitchen, and they needed your order slip to stop the bleeding.\"  \"Sorry, I got busy and forgot to put in your order.\"  \"Hey, I am not sure what is going on, but it is odd that you don't have lunch still.\"  ANYTHING. Just communicate. Clearly there is an issue if we have been to lunch for nearly an hour and still do not have lunch.  Ironically (TRUE STORY ALERT), an elderly couple using a walker to get around was seated after us, and ate, paid, and left BEFORE we got our lunch. It reminded me of the movie Office Space, it was great. When it came time to pay the bill, we made it a point to tip 25%, we were pretty sure that if others had as slow a lunch as we did, diners would mistakingly ding the server, when it was a kitchen issue.  In conclusion, as we got to the parking lot my peer told me she would never return, and sadly I had to agree. It's a weird thing when you remove a restaurant from your future rotation, but it had to happen. It is not cool to take an hour and a half to have a 'quick lunch' mere minutes from the office."}
{"text":"Red Lobster brings back a lot of nostalgia for moi. My older brother tried it first time before I knew what this place was and said oh one must try the admiral's feast and I made sure I tried it on my next visit to North America. I recall liking it as my palate hadn't developed much at that time and food was mainly fuel and my idea of seafood mainly consisted of everything deep fried. When I moved to North America I did go back to this chain mainly to try their stuffed lobster (note the stuffing in lobster for Canada is different from the one in US) as it was decent. Another charm for me is their Signature Margaritas which are good and once one adds a shot can be quite potent so I do come here for those once in a while as apparently hard to get a good margarita in town.   This spot is what one expects from a chain offering i.e consistent. I think they are reasonably priced if one doesn't order the whole lobster (go figure) service was decent. I can't really say the lobster I had here was bad as it is just plain steamed. The biscuit were decent so was clam chowder. Service was attentive.  Exactly what I expect from a chain restaurant.  3 Stars and recommended for their margaritas."}
{"text":"Red lobster is one of my favorite places for seafood. clean restaurant affordable prices and awesome food !! Their parmesan crusted tilapia is one of a kind! Their biscuits are pure awesomeness !!!"}
{"text":"Don't waste your time or money. Beyond dreadful. Not sure who was supposed to be in charge but the inmates run the asylum here."}
{"text":"Every time that we've come here, it's always been a pretty good experience.. I usually get the Maui Luau Shrimp and Salmon with a house salad (yummo!) and hubs got the NY Strip and Rock Lobster Tail.   We both can never get tired of the unlimited hot biscuits they bring over before the meal. Not to mention, the Sunset Passion Colada is superb, I usually get it virgin cos we usually have baby with us when we dine... don't want mama to get outta hand!  Service is usually very friendly and accomodating, does not wow my socks off, but definitely not bad at all."}
{"text":"It's kind of ironic that Red Lobster national advertised on Yelp and yet, their local chain Yelp profiles are so poorly managed.  Oh, well.  I have had an obsession with Red Lobster since I was a wee tot.  Sometimes nothing is better in my mouth than a shrimp.  Let me briefly chronicle my history with the RL:  -Site of my first Caesar Salad -Site of my first salad -Cheddar Bay Biscuits can cure cancer -Cheddar Bay Biscuits in excess probably lead to heart disease -Site of my first breaded shrimp and shrimp scampi -My birthday destination two years running (shout out to the Archer Road location in Gainesville, FL)  I have been to this location thrice.  The first time was a great date (and no, I didn't dump him because he took to Red Lobster).  Our server's name escapes me, but she was super sweet and fun.  The second time was after a tryst and an excuse to use a gift certificate.  The bartender did a great job of giving me proper biscuit refilling.  My third time was today.  The barhop was serviceable.  I don't think he wanted to be there on a Saturday morning.  Regardless, the biscuits were the best I have had in a while.  Fresh from the oven, the cheese inside stuck to the crumbly sides.  So buttery, so stomach clogging.  None of the food besides the biscuits is stellar, but honestly, there are no better biscuits to be found anywhere.  Not even Popeye's.  Yea, I went there."}
{"text":"R.L. is one of my favorites...   Typically I am not a fan of chain restaurants, but I love good solid seafood that's just broiled or steamed.  I don't want fancy, I don't want sauces, I don't want pasta... I just want the delectable tender meat of snow crab.    I've been to Joe's Crab Shack, but I hate their butter-- tastes like movie popcorn butter.  The biscuits at RL-  I could eat a bunch of them!!     Ultimate Feast forever!!!"}
{"text":"This place used to be better :(   The most recent visit I had was pretty bad. The fish tasted disgusting, my broccoli was old, and my mashed potatoes were dry.  The cheese biscuits are still good though!"}
{"text":"Went here for my Birthday on January 21. Everything was delicious my only complaint was the hot butter they served me was cold so I asked for more and the second one was cold as well. Overall the food and service was good."}
{"text":"It's really all about those biscuits. It's been many moons since I dined at Red Lobster, but away we went for a recent lunch. Right away I tore into three cheddar biscuits and never looked back. I think I added one more biscuit to the total by meal's end. The meal itself was kind of average as I had three shrimp tacos served with rice. The tacos had too many sauces involved (one on bottom and one on top), but the rice was good and the shrimp ok too. The other meal was a simple ceasar salad and a cup of potato bacon soup. We were out the door for less than 20 bucks full of biscuits and knowing that the ones in the box we try to make at home would never be as good as the ones served in-house."}
{"text":"We are RL regulars, and have been in several different cities. This one is clean, has decent service, but the taste isn't quite what I'm used to. The biscuits are okay rather than delicious and the blackened fish is pretty bland."}
{"text":"Although, the decor is drab and in need of a thorough cleaning and replacement, this older Red Lobster delivers on what I call, \"Fast-Food seafood\" in that the taste is very good, and the meals are usually fresh, hot and the service is pretty darn good.  I have certainly been to newer Red Lobster locations; but, for the chain, this one delivers and is adequate.  The food is mid-range in price ( I believe a bit pricey) but one kinda understands this business before you step foot in any of their establishments.  No surprises to speak of on price."}
{"text":"Lack of caring service!! It was just the second time for me having food here but not my husband. We decided to come here bcoz I thought seafood here is good.  We grabbed cocktails before starting our dinner. My husband did order Shrimp Caesar, I was not ready at that time. The server just took the order..she didn't say thing or recommend me anything. When she came back, I ordered Bahama cocktail. It was good though but felt like alcohol was less than it mentions. (I'm sensitive to alcohol, but I felt nothing!) Salad came, was normal taste but the BISCUIT was great! Next, our main dishes, were ok. We got the combination of lobster, crab (difficult to eat much), breaded shrimp and butter shrimp, it was just ok for me...Another dish was rainbow trout with lemon butter, I like this one! Everything seemed good except the service. I asked our waitress for more sauce during we were having our food. She was disappeared from our tables. Forgot! or IGNORED! or both!!!! I didn't call her anymore bcoz I didn't see her was too busy to come to check us gain. I saw her around there many times but she didn't even come to check us (as i thought..bcoz I got the feeling that she didn't care about serving us) till we finished!!  She grabbed us the bill then gone again! I saw her when we were leaving. I was sure she saw us but she said nothing, acted like we were not there. Thank you for your ignorance (to that old lady) We gave u tips bcoz u might need it and hope u could improve yourself..and really hope the restaurant could have some more lively servers who are good at service."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this restaurant.   The portions are large, the food delicious, and the service impeccable!   However, the prices have gone up quite a bit since I was last there about 2 years ago. A shame really, for that I couldn't give it 5 stars, the prices increase far faster than the cost of inflation."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped at the Red Lobster on 7/4/13.  It was open and the parking lot was busy.  We started with the wood fire grilled bruschetta with shrimp.  It was really good.  A bottle of Kendall Jackson chardonnay made it even better!  We then shared a trio of wood fire salmon, shrimp skewers, and crab legs.  It came with a salad.  The flavors were fine.  The portions were small.  Our server was pleasant.  We'd return, but would probably  stay at the bar to enjoy a bottle of KJ with 2 orders of the  wood fire grilled bruschetta with shrimp and pass on the rest."}
{"text":"We just moved to Surprise and decided to go here for dinner. The service was terrible. My husband and I were given paper napkins when everyone around us had cloth napkins.  We asked for cloth and they arrived, after several prompts to our waitress at the end of our meal.  We waited forever for our meal and had to ask several times for refills on our drinks.    About 3 weeks after our terrible dining experience, we drove by Red Lobster on our way to Lowes. We saw a delivery guy, with boxes of seafood, waiting outside the back door in over 100 degree heat. He looked like he had been there for awhile. Meanwhile, all that food was spoiling in the heat.  After seeing this, we decided that we will NEVER dine at this Red Lobster again. No food poisoning for us, thank you!"}
{"text":"So we saw an add in Cuba on American Satellite for all you can eat shrimp. Hoping against hope that this also applied to Canada, my girlfriend and I ventured down there.   The place is a bit dated. Think 80s hotel bar shiek and the TV's in the bar were all on the fritz. The buzzers they give you when your table is ready was also 90s tastic.   Luckily there were still having the all you can eat shrimp deal. 22 for all you can eat from about 5 or 6 different preparations of shrimp including Alfredo, Garlic, classic and a few others. All of them were quite good if a bit starchy. I mean it's not the Ritz but it's decent enough.   Service was also quite friendly."}
{"text":"We were a party of ten.  Most of us ordered off the lunch special menu.  It took forever for the food to come.  When it did, only half of us received our order, had to wait a couple of minutes for the other five to receive their food.   The wait staff was just okay.  The kitchen on the other hand, has issues.   Quality of food has declined over the years at red lobster in my opinion.     To top it off, one of our members found a shard of glass in their iced tea drink..!  Wait staff just matter of fact about it..!  Will not be returning."}
{"text":"Took my sister to the the Independence Blvd location. The service was great but shrimp platter I had was mediocre. The chocolate cake and ice cream dessert was really good and sort of made for the slightly disappointing main. The bread rolls however are still a favorite."}
{"text":"A typical Red Lobster, exactly what you would expect. The wait was typical for a restaurant in this area on a Saturday.  The reason I'm commenting is that I thought the hostess was really nice and did a great job. While we were waiting she dealt with some rude people and did a really good job. I think her name was Missy or something like that.  The restaurant was recently revamped and looks really nice on the outside and inside."}
{"text":"After the long wait up front for some weird reason on a Wednesday night, the 20 min they said, easily turned into 30 min wait . That was upsetting, however our waiter Irvin was the best waiter I've had in a long time. Turned the whole experience around. Thank you Irvin, had it not been for you I would have never returned to this location again. Plenty of restaurants to eat at in Vegas, I wouldn't have came back but our waiter was great. 5 stars for him"}
{"text":"Went for dinner on a Monday evening. Gave name for table of three. Group of three ahead of us and a group of three came in after. Last group was called first. My wife walked right up and told hostess we were there before them. Hostess replied she was following order on computer. A few minutes later she called us. My wife went up and said no, these three were her first. Again she said she was following in order. The first three then told her she was not correct. How hard can this be?. The order she claimed she was following seemed more like random. My wife ordered the lobster roll. Said it didnt even seem like real lobster, hard and chewy. My dish had cold fries, cold rice and tough shrimp. The one star is for my father in laws dish he liked, even though they forgot to bring the sauce topping. They comped us one app for all three, over cooked fried shrimp...wont be back"}
{"text":"will never go here again b/c for the 3rd time they messed up my to go order. they offered me a gift card one time but never got it. they tried to \"apoligize\" but it was half harted in the apology. they claimed when i was there that all my order was in the bag and when i got home to check it was not. I will never got there again. they are to serve the customers and they are doing a poor job in doing that. they really don't care about the customers and they need to have the check in hand when they are putting the orders together."}
{"text":"The food is good so is the service. But wow is it pricy. Been a while since i was here. Most meals are 20 bucks and up. For half the money i could get just as good a meal down the street at a less pretentious restraunt."}
{"text":"Three in our party served by Carl. Thirty minute wait on Friday eve but time was about right.  Carl there quickly after seated. Drinks and lobster dip appetizer served quickly.  Appetizer excellent. Two orders of lobster and red shrimp very good. Green beans EXCELLENT.  One salmon very good. Food and service very good. Bill presented on time"}
{"text":"Being a native New Englander from a fishing family with a birthday coinciding on Monday, I had a tremendous craving for a Maine lobster. Off I went and entered Red Lobster at around 8 PM Saturday. The place was a graveyard.   I was seated immediately and asked if I was ready to order. I told the server I'd like a moment to peruse the menu but I really wanted a Maine lobster. Laughing, the server pointed to the empty lobster tank. How does a restaurant run out of it's signature product on a weekend? He told me he'd bring me some biscuits and left.  When the server returned,  I ordered the stuffed mushrooms, the lobster bisque and the Bar Harbor Lobster Bake. I was not asked if I wanted to order drinks or dessert. The server promised biscuits again, and left.  The server returned with, alas, without the biscuits, but the stuffed mushroom appetizer. The server cautioned me the dish was extremely hot, He promised to bring me biscuits again, and left. I gave the food some time to cool and let the flavors settle. The appetizer was quite delightful. However, I apparently waited to long.  The remaining courses began to arrive in rapid succession, literally piling up on the table. I was flummoxed as the was restaurant was nearly empty. I was promised biscuits each time the server came, but alas! Those biscuits and I had paths that were apparently never meant to cross.  The other problem that was nearly comical is that by the time I got to each dish in succession, it had cooled to the point of dissatisfaction. The lobster bisque had congealed. The main course should have been called the Bar Harbor Linguine Cover with a dash of Seafood. A smaller portion of pasta would have better allowed one to savor the flavors of the seafood and the accompanying sauces.   Incidentally, the food presentation reminded me of something you would see in a hospital., The main course was covered in a plastic container and made me feel like I was in an assisted living facility.  At the end, the server came back with a check (about 45 dollars), and asked me if I would like to take some biscuits on takeaway. Anyone who has eaten a cold biscuit probably can guess why I refused this offer. And who knows, perhaps I'd still be sitting there, waiting...  I can see that many people enjoy this place. I heartily recommend spending one's money elsewhere. The salesmanship, service, food preparation, and quality leave much to be desired. I think had it been busy it may explain why they bring the food so quickly. One may not notice."}
{"text":"This is our goto place for celebrations and a great meal!  Always fresh always good service.  Drinks, Appetizers, Dinner, Dessert ENTIRELY  YUMM-O"}
{"text":"Good place for get together with friends. Cozy environment. Me and my roommate ordered endless shrimp. We all prefer Garlic and Mediterranean flavors. Deep fried shrimp tastes similar, and not very recommended. Waitresses are very friendly."}
{"text":"I have been to this location 4 times with the hopes that what I have experienced here would not repeat itself.  Unfortunately, it did and the experiences have all earned this restaurant location 2 stars at best.  Slow, Mixed up, Food cold and a generally inability to get it right.  I am afraid that I will not return to this location again.  Four times is by any measure enough time to turn it around and they could not do so."}
{"text":"I go to this location from time to time to take advantage of their specials. I went there to get the lobster roll lunch special but my waitress talked me out of it cause she said ppl were complaining about it's size (too small).  So I switched up to the lobster tacos which I ate at the restaurant and then I got the lobster pizza to go. When I got home the pizza was cold and not very good. I've had it at the restaurant and it's good when it comes out hot, but what I did was I warmed the oven to 300 and put it in the oven for 10 mins and brought that pizza back to life. It was very good after that."}
{"text":"Went for dinner to Red Lobster for my Mom's 67th birthday. There were 8 in total in our party. Out server was polite and no one had any complaints in regards to their food."}
{"text":"when the mother wants lobster, to red lobster we go. it was a bit different when i went to college in maine and she came for a visit but hellsya red lobster brought the goods tonight, specifically tim, our waiter, and as the hostess referred to him as she sat us (i think all red lobster wait staff may somehow go by the same title but tim was ridic), our \"seafood expert\".    first, tim fielded the 129 questions about substitutions from my mom like he wrote the book on jewish mothers. it was like he knew that when my mom tries a bite of someone else's food she returns the spoon or fork with half of the original food on it.  when we asked for an additional spoon for her to try my soup, he brought her a little plastic cuppy of soup just for her, to avoid half eaten food on utensil interference.    second, my wine pour was generous and appreciated. third, i don't know what the fuck is in those buttery delicious biscuits but hot damn they were buttery delicious (for anyone who comes to portland or lives in portland and reads this, imagine pine state biscuits times 2347) and fo freee and tim kept em coming.   chains often get a bad rap, and often for good reasons. but tim the seafood expert + decentish lobster+ buttery delicious biscuits + big wine = 4 star. my only negative is that they are really pushing this design your own festival of shrimp shit a bit too much. i have now unbuttoned and am ready for the rest of a night with mother, which will likely involve law and order, cribbage, and our daily routine of shitting on sheriff joe. toy lista"}
{"text":"Every time I come home for a visit, I try and find a way to go to Red Lobster. They don't have it in Vancouver, and it's a travesty! The cheddar biscuits here are like crack.  I came here for my dad's birthday dinner. Actually I kind of insisted on it, since I've been craving RL for quite some time. Also, we went because I noticed a new dinner deal where for $18 you get a soup, salad, choice of entree (out of 6 selections), and a choice of dessert. How awesome is that? Let me list this for you: 1. their clam chowder is ah-mazing, 2. the entree options are mostly shrimp, but there's a fish option there if you're not a fan, and 3. there's a chocolate option for the desserts. yes please! The other time that I'd love to hit up Red Lobster would be during Shrimp Fest. *drool*  Service was very good - food came out quick and our server was very attentive, bringing us refills before our drinks were even empty. This is a great place for a casual family meal, and I can't wait to come back again.   In summary: cheddar biscuits for the win."}
{"text":"God I wish my husband would find a new favorite restaurant.  Cheddar Bay Biscuits should be their own food group."}
{"text":"I know, I know. It's Red Lobster. It's been at least 10 years since I set foot in one. But Hubby and I watch the Food Network, and on Sunday we saw Kelsey win the Fresh Fish Challenge on the Next Food Network Star. It was an odd sounding dish- Macadamia Tilapia with White Chocolate Beurre Blanc- and Hubby decided he had to try it. So I got a couple of gift cards using my AmEx points (so if it was awful, at least we weren't paying for it).  Hubby's Advice to Yelpers: \"Get over your disdain for chains and do not miss this dish. Kelsey is some kind of bizarre genius.\" And I have to agree. I never would have thought this would be good, but it totally works. The tilapia was perfectly cooked, crusted with a generous amount of toasted macadamia nuts, and sitting in a pool of beurre blanc with a light taste of white chocolate. For Top Chef fans, this was NOT anything like Dale's butterscotch scallops. It was subtle and unexpectedly amazing.  My dinner was fine. I had the honey and citrus glazed grilled skewers of shrimp and scallops. The scallops were overdone, but the shrimp were cooked well and the glaze was a really nice complement to them.   Conclusion: Go for the Kelsey special. It's the real deal."}
{"text":"Yes. I have been to both Pickle Barrel and Red Lobster in the past two weeks.  My foodie soul is dying.  I knew it was going to be bad.  I said, \"Red Lobster is not good,\" and I haven't even been in over 15 years.  It was pretty much the same, but I didn't get offered the treasure chest.  Peach marguerita was good, but when I asked for a strawberry marguerita, it was a totally different drink - different level of sweetness, different glass, different accruements.  Service was friendly but he wasn't around much, so you had to wait for him to appear if you needed him - no flagging him down.    Lobster bisque wasn't thick enough and was overly rich with not enough pepper to cut the richness.  I had the seaside sampler - \"jumbo\" shrimp (just 4  regular sized pre-frozen shrimp), 4 coconut shrimp (with a disgusting pina colada dip on the side) and 4 \"seafood stuffed\" mushrooms in a heavy, oily sauce.   So, basically - it was a Red Lobster."}
{"text":"The food and service at this location are exceptional. I visited this location twice within a 6 month span, along with an additional location in town, and this location supersedes the other location any day. The food is always prepared perfectly, and the quality is very evident in appearance and taste. The wait staff are kind, friendly and always helpful. Definitely recommend this location to fulfill your buttery, lemony seafood cravings with an end result that doesn't disappoint."}
{"text":"Oh no,  Service has gotten so bad here. I remember when I was a kid and it was an actual treat to get to go to Red Lobster, now its a punishment.  Please work on the service at this location."}
{"text":"Horrible meal.  King Crab legs that you had to wring out.  Rice as hard as a rock.  Do not waste your money here."}
{"text":"Pretty decent food and service, but a pretty classic corporate ran restaurant. Love the biscuits though!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been going to this Red Lobster for years. It has really gone downhill lately. About 1 month ago we went, and I ordered fish, but they were out of the two sides that I wanted. My husband orders the exact same thing every time we go. So last week, we went, he ordered his usual steak and shrimp, and I ordered salmon. The one thing we love about eating here, is that we get our bread right when order, which we like to eat WITH our salads. This time, our salads came and still no bread. The waitress said the bread was still in the oven. They weren't that busy that they should  have been able to get us bread quickly. Then, 5 MINUTES  before the meal arrived, the waitress came by to inform me that the asparagus I ordered was an extra $2.50. I told her I didn't want it then and changed my side to green beans. 5 minutes later our meal arrived, and still no bread! We had to ask for it. And the green beans didn't arrive until I was almost done eating! At that point, I didn't even want them! Then, our bill came. Mind you, we ate \"lunch\" at Red Lobster and I drank water and my husband had a soda. $46? For lunch? I took a closer look at the bill, and our waitress had charged my husband, who ordered the steak and shrimp platter for $18.99 , was charged $18.99 for the steak, and then the shrimp separately, for another $5.99. That;s for only 5 shrimp! When I asked the waitress about it, she said it was because he upgraded to \"fried shrimp\" instead of :shrimp scampi\". We were never informed that it would be extra, AND, had never been charged extra  for the fried shrimp in the past. When we asked to speak to the manager, she \"re-did\" the bill, and it came to 30 cents MORE  than the original bill. I told her that was unacceptable and that we had never been charged for the fried shrimp vs the shrimp scampi in the past, and she was unwilling to work with us. I just feel like with all the problems we had, I would rather spend $46 for lunch somewhere else, which is too bad because we have always loved Red Lobster"}
{"text":"Will not ever be back. The food was extremely salty to salty to even consume. The window ledge was so dusty dust was floating around not to mention the 3 gnats that kept flying around and sitting in the window seal. My server was very nice but pretty slow i think she was new. The only good thing were the drinks i would recommend the drinks. I did speak with a manager who resolve the issues and I do plan on speaking with the general manager as well considering how poorly the food was."}
{"text":"The service was great by my server however.  There's nothing like eating your food when staff is yelling In the kitchen with the top of there lungs.  If you do that there should be a door in place. I went there for my craving for crab in the evening.  The crab was over cooked and because of that there was no meat.  I am not a complainer. This is the second time going to this location and will not be coming back."}
{"text":"I was seated right away and my food was brought out quickly. My waitress, Jordan was absolutely kind. She constantly came over to my table to check on me."}
{"text":"Red Lobster reminds me of Olive Garden with a seafood focus. Our server reminded me of Brian, the sever with \"flair\" from Office Space. He seemed nice, just a tad over the top.  I appreciate the effort, but he had a little to much energy for me.    The food was better than I expected and they were perfect size portions for lunch. My salad was a little over dressed and the add on shrimp were the tiny little ones (now I see why it was only 99 cents), I wouldn't get them again. The biscuits and jambalaya were good.  We went there to use a gift card we won. I would go back if we won another one, but with so many places to eat, Red Lobster is not going to be my first pick."}
{"text":"The food was great and came to the table hot but I reduced it by a star for service. On hey Sunday afternoon with the parking lot helpful we still had to wait 15 minutes to be seated. Also the waitress Melody was or in her service. She failed to bring us straws for drinks or crackers for our crab and also we always had to ask her to help her drinks refilled she never stop by to fill them on her own. Once we were done with dinner it took her 10 minutes to realize that we were done and come over to bring us a bill."}
{"text":"Huge fan of biscuits but I think they've forgotten about me in the corner. I need water and more salad dressing and no one is here  maybe avoid the dinner rush if you do come?"}
{"text":"Ripoff prices, poor service with mistakes, only two fresh fish, sadly I must report Red Lobster has dropped from four stars in past to one star now.    Wayne Gorsek"}
{"text":"Lobster was good, but that was it! Waited 20 minutes to be seated. On the way to our table we counted 12 empty tables. Why where we waiting then? For what? Once we were seated we waited again 30 minutes for our lobster. We asked twice for the buisquets and they naver came. Margheritas were not good either and when we asked the bartender to fix them we were told she had to charge us again to do that. Who manages that place? Simply unbelievable! Price/service/food quality simply didn't match. Not going back!"}
{"text":"Great sea food, lobster in all kind! Parking right outside the doorstep. I had the \"land & sea\" which included a NY steak- amazing!! Not very cheap, but totally worth it"}
{"text":"My husband LOVES seafood and I honestly cannot stand to eat it.  With that being said, He LOVES Red Lobster so anytime I let him choose the place to go out to eat, it is almost always Red Lobster!  He usually gets some sort of Ultimate Feast or something like that and doesn't leave a bit behind, so it must be delicious.   That being said...I wish there were more options for us non seafood eaters.  Typically we have the choice of Maple Glazed Chicken or Cajun Chicken Fettuccini.  Although I do like the Cajun Chicken Fettuccini, I wish they would offer some other non seafood items.  I do like the biscuits and the salad is OK, would be better with croutons, cheese and/or egg and their drink menus are awesome.  Before everyone says this a seafood place...expect only seafood....The restaurant should understand that not everyone in a family likes seafood.  All I'm recommending is to open up the menu a bit maybe offer some other appetizers or entrees that are not seafood related js."}
{"text":"Red lobster is one of my favorites, especially during Lent.  But what makes this location standout was our server, Aubrey.    She was just about the best server I have ever come across.  Very attentive, kind and made us feel welcomed.  This is why I gave this location 5 stars"}
{"text":"I came here for a company luncheon a few months ago and the staff did their best and was very attentive, friendly, and helpful to our party of 20+.  It was a little difficult to make the reservation with them at first and a couple of our meals were brought out incomplete but I didn't expect perfection as we each ordered our own appetizers, entrees and desserts (that's a lot of food to deliver).   Three stars because the food and service was good but Red Lobster is not my personal restaurant of choice."}
{"text":"There was a time they actually cooked Lobster to your preference, now the choices are few and every plate is microwaved! Officially my last visit to one of these!"}
{"text":"This was my first time visiting the Charlotte  area. Our waitress was ok. The issue at hand was the time, my wife and 2 of our children and 1 grandchild were there for almost an hour. Then we got those good Red Lobster biscuits. They need to be a little more concientous of time."}
{"text":"Lunch is definitely a lot more affordable than dinner prices. Our waiter Rashawn was fabulous! We came here to celebrate my birthday.   The Caesar Salads were fresh and tasty with shaved Parmesan.   My son enjoyed his endless shrimp dinner. He didn't care for the Mediterranean grilled shrimp, but he enjoyed six servings of Shrimp Scampi.   I had the create 2 combination. They used large scallops. I prefer the small bay scallops they used to have. Moreover, there was an addition charge of $2.79 each serving (2). The garlic mash was alright.  They celebrated my birthday with brownie a la mode."}
{"text":"I was very excited to go here for dinner it was one of the worst dinners I had out in a long time. They served me bad mussels and the rest of the seafood was way overcooked. I was sick for several days after eating the few mussel which is the only part of the dish I finished. They tried to give me something else but if you can't get one of advertised specials right I have little fate in another dish. On a side note we haven't been there for over ten years I don't think I'll ever go back and I love seafood."}
{"text":"Note that I am not a seafood person - but my husband has always wanted to try this place! I didn't order seafood but I will try to comment for both of our meals.   I was expecting it to be pretty tacky inside and I was pleasantly surprised that I didn't see any plastic lobsters or anchors on the wall! The decor was what I would think a captains cabin to look like - lots of wood accents and it was actually really nice. All the staff were dressed well in black pants and dress shirts as well.   We both ordered the four course feast which is only available Monday to Thursday and is $21.99 for soup, salad, main and a brownie with ice cream for dessert. You also get unlimited biscuits with this meal. It was a really great price for all the food.   I have to say I am SO IMPRESSED with how quickly the food came out. The starters didn't take any time at all plus as soon as we were done our starters our dinners were ready.  The staff were very friendly. Our server (I believe her name was Dolly) was always right there to refill drinks and those amazing biscuits.   The starters were great. We both had Caesar salad which was similar to Panera bread's salad with real cheese.  I had the potato and bacon creamy soup which was very nice and my husband absolutely loved his clam chowder! So the starters were definitely really good.   The mains...   My husband ordered the garlic shrimp. It came with two skewers of shrimp which he said were awesome, he was surprised with how many they gave him. His came with rice as well as broccoli... The broccoli was just normal broccoli but the rice, he said the rice tasted like microwave uncle bens. Granted he really only cared about the shrimp so he was happy!   Now I ordered the Cajun chicken Alfredo (I know... Chicken not seafood lol). It was decent... Normally this item is around $18. It definitely wasn't THAT good. It wasn't exactly restaurant quality pasta or chicken - it was something you could easily make at home.    The dessert was so good! It was a nice hot brownie with vanilla ice cream covered in chocolate and caramel sauce. The serving size was perfect and the fact that the brownie was hot with the cold ice cream was awesome.  Overall I would definitely go again - probably order the exact same thing as well because you can't beat that price for everything you get plus the experience was overall really good. I would give it a 4.5 if I could."}
{"text":"We had dinner here and loved it! The service was friendly & efficient! The food was delicious! The establishment was clean and orderly. We will return."}
{"text":"Went to dinner tonight - restaurant not busy.  First, waiter brought us a dirty glass that had coke in it.  We ordered appetizer and he apparently forgot it because he brought out our salad and then rolls.  No plates no extra napkins.  He took someones order next to us and when he asked them if they wanted an appetizer he looked over at us like he knew he forgot to put it in.   Finally, appetizer arrived - no extra plates to put it on.  30 minutes later we got our meal and it was wrong - fish looked like it was reheated and asked for shrimp on skewer and got garlic shrimp that was dry and not very good.  The other meal - was minus the steak he said it was too overcooked  We asked for the check and forget the steak and then he brought out the steak which was still overdone and dry.  Will NOT be going back for a while."}
{"text":"The best thing was the cheese biscuits. Laurie, our server was next. She was friendly and kept hooking us up with more of those yummy biscuits. The New England clam chowder was okay. The Caesar salad had great croutons, dressing and shaved Parmesan, but the Romaine lettuce tasted like it had stayed too long in a plastic bag on the verge of being frozen. My fried bay scallops were tasty and was served with a homemade tartar sauce and commercial cocktail sauce. It was an okay experience but I am not sure I will be back for a while unless I am craving me some cheese biscuit."}
{"text":"My lobster tail wasn't served with my dinner. It didn't come until 10 minutes after the rest of my meal, so I didn't get to eat it with the rest of my food. This has happened previously to me at this same location, so it was upsetting. My girlfriend's lobster tail was really puny (4\"?) and overcooked, so it was sent back. The replacement (#2) had some strange seasoning added, which isn't made clear anywhere in the menu or by the service staff. We've had lobster tails here before, and they didn't have any seasonings.   My girlfriend had initially ordered \"a lot of extra sour cream\" for her baked potato, when we had placed the original dinner order. It came with just a real small amount. My girlfriend again asked for \"a lot more\", and the waitress only brought one more small container. My girlfriend told her that it still wasn't enough. The waitress then disappeared, reappeared empty handed, then was seen with someone else's food. The waitress didn't have any more sour cream on her tray. With that, I asked another waiter to have the manager come over.  The manager was pleasant and seemed genuinely interested in helping the situation, and asked if my girlfriend wanted a third tail. She said yes.  The waitress then brought the next table's dinners, and asked them if there was anything else that they wanted. They said no, and the waitress started to walk away. I got rather perturbed, and then told the waitress that there was something else that WE wanted. She seemed dumbfounded, like she totally forgot we'd been asking for more sour cream, several times. We reminded her, and she then brought 3 more small containers, which finally settled the sour cream issue.  Our waitress then started waiting on a table of 15 that had just arrived. I asked her if she could first get us the third lobster tail while it was hot, along with a takeout container, a plastic bag, and our check. She spoke to a coworker, and few minutes later, the manager brought the lobster tail, takeout boxes, bag and the check.  We paid, still left a 20%+ tip (The waitress could have done a LOT better job, but the kitchen screw up wasn't her fault, and their wages are generally poor), and we left, most likely never to return."}
{"text":"A birthday staple! The servers are super nice at this location. Although it's not a cheap meal (as with most seafood), I always leave satisfied. Can't go wrong with the east coast lobster tail, crab legs, and cheddar bay biscuits. I would recommend staying away from the steak though, as I have never gotten one at my requested temperature. Stick to what they do best!"}
{"text":"The food and service here is as good as any chain restaurant. What I really wanted to yelp about is, that I was there last night with my 81 year old mom in a wheel chair. The restaurant is not designed to accommodated handicapped people.  The tables are too close together and we were bumping into chairs as we proceeded to and from our table.  The bathrooms have heavy doors that are not handicap friendly.  Mom was not able to independently open the two doors to enter and exit the restrooms. It is a shame that my mother (who likes the Red Lobster food) will no longer be eating at THIS location!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I went there to celebrate my 45th birthday with my father and my son if I could a gave this restaurant no stars I would have!! My father my son and myself just visited there on May 7 and we all ordered the ultimate feast only my order of course was screwed up. I had ordered a shrimp cocktail instead of fried shrimp with my meal and ask them to bring it out as an appetizer that never happened they came out with my food!! Then when our food did come out but actually I had asked for loaded mashed potatoes with butter sour cream and cheese they just gave me mashed potatoes then my crab legs they weren't even together they threw on a pile of crab legs that were all broken apart and they only end crab leg was connected to the knuckle and then when I asked the waiter for a manager because I felt that this was totally unacceptable 10 minutes had went by and by this time my theater is absolutely getting cold and I was hungry so I felt they better eat something so I started in on my shrimp scampi and that was already called and the little rock lobster tail was Already cold my whole meal was basically ruined!! Finally when the manager didn't get to the table and I complained he said let me go get you a new set of crab legs so he goes ahead and brings me a set a cab legs drop some off to the table and leaves OK so I'm sitting there when I'm I supposed to dip them in!! He did not even bring any butter with them!! My father was actually paying for the meal because it was my birthday and he really did not want me to make a scene however I really wanted to curse them out because the service was horrible our plates were piled up on the end of the table nobody was bussing our table!! The food was horrible it was cold the crab legs where are horrible they were sticking to the inside of the shell I don't know if they were over or what they were called they were nasty and horrible I have never been so disappointed and Red Lobster in my life!! I was so looking for word to a wonderful birthday dinner and it was such a shame because it was totally ruined by them very disappointed and I will never ever go back and I hope that anybody reading this message will never even give them the time of day we paid the whole entire check we did not ask for any discount at all and we still Tipped the waiter accordingly that's just the nice people that we are however that place is totally downhill and really needs to get their act together I could've went to a fast food restaurant and had better service!! If I could reach you lower and going to the negative side I definitely would!! I really love eating at red lobster however this one I will never go there ever again!! Very disappointed customer!! As far as I'm concerned you should be very ashamed of your establishment!!"}
{"text":"You know what? I must really have been brain-washed over the years to think that Red Lobster was some kind of up-scale eatery, because.... IT AIN'T! It's about as classy as a Sizzler, and they're not even in business anymore.  My boyfriend and I waited about 15 minutes for a booth and 4 times(!) during that 15 minutes, a waiter walked right by us and into the bar where he stood watching the basketball game on the TV. And yes, THIS GUY turned out to be our waiter. No doubt he was checking the hoops game while we ate because we hardly ever saw him (I don't think he smiled once the whole time we were there).  I had the Admiral's Feast combination plate, while my boyfriend had the big Lobster/Steak dish... thing... plate... whatever. OK, the food was good. Cool, no problem, but you know what? Like I said at the beginning, there's nothing really super-duper about Red Lobster. What I mean is, Long John Silver's food is good, too (maybe better) -- and a helluva lot more reasonable on your wallet.  $75.00 for two people for dinner!!!.... at Red Lobster?!!! RED FREAKING LOBSTER?!!!!!!! Holy smoke! I never remember it being THAT high. And when I finished the pay process, the waiter just grabbed the final check in the folding book and bailed -- FAST!!! I guess the basketball game went into overtime.  I've said it before... and now again.... the customer doesn't have to go to a bad restaurant. There are plenty of them out there. If a restaurant cares about keeping our patronage, if they care about making some good money with their restaurant, IF THEY HAVE ANY BRAINS AT ALL, they should get their act together. They shouldn't disrespect the customer by dissing good management practices...... THAT'S what makes a restaurant a place worth one's time, or just another hole-in-the-wall.  Thanx, everybody. I'm finished with my tirade. Until..... MY - NEXT - REVIEW !... dun-dun-dunnnnnnn!!!"}
{"text":"Went for a quick lunch. Wings are fantastic, totts with cheese sauce, and Brandon with ridiculously fantastic service...... Really what else can you ask for.   Thanks again Brandon"}
{"text":"We went here last night for a celebration dinner for my daughter, we had a party of 12. The non seafood eaters ordered burgers, which were burnt and the taste was so gross! Another person, who is pregnant ordered the chile shrimp, which was so ungodly hot, it tasted like straight up ghost peppers. We let the waitress know, all she did was bring ranch. Take it away and dont charge us, didnt want to eat after that. Lastly, the service was very very slow. Upon leaving not one person asked us how everything was. Will not be returning ever again! For 3 people a $75.00 tab, all we were left with, was throwing up and nasty food!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Had a gift card for Red Lobster, but we are residents of Massachusetts, and we know fresh seafood. Came back to Ohio to see family and had lunch at RL to use up the gift card $100, which is not easy at lunch hour. Two adults, one senior and two children. Wait staff was really attentive and we had plenty of bay biscuits and drink refills. We prefer three apps, calamari, shrimp cocktail and stuffed mushroom caps. Calamari was nice, crunchy, only rings. Stuffed caps were so so, not certain stuffed w much crab. Saved the shrimp cocktail for my daughter. We had two bowls of clam chowder, two mini lobster rolls, tiny broiled flounder w rice pilaf (lunch version probably for a tiny person as I have seen larger sunfish, fish tacos, three shrimp platter and side salads. All the food was typical red lobster. Nothing horrible, nothing extraordinary. W soft drinks spent $114+tip.  New England definitely has the best seafood, which is probably why Red Lobster is not located in the area."}
{"text":"Another fantastic meal experience at Red Lobster (Burnhamthorpe, Mississauga). I can't begin to tell you how wonderful our server Amanda was. She was so attentive and very well versed in the menu. We went during Lobsterfest so I had the Fire Grilled lobster tail and red shrimp served with rice and green beans. My starter was lobster bisque and I greatly enjoyed the Island Rum Punch. Everything tasted fresh and again the service was top notch. The cheddar bay biscuits were fantastic as usual. I had the key lime pie which was light, creamy and the citrus flavour was a great compliment to my seafood meal. My starter was the combination of shrimp cocktail, coconut shrimp and stuffed mushrooms. Needless to say I was so full but enjoyed everything."}
{"text":"Very sub par place. EVERYTHING was so very salty. Olive Garden was packed across the way so we decided to give the Red Lobster a shot. Uhhg! No wonder the place was empty. It SUCKS! Service was alright but the food was terrible. Yeah, if you're thinking about going, don't!"}
{"text":"UGGGGH. It is red Lobster what do you expect? Red Lobster is the Denny's of seafood. It is garbage with a ton of salt on it. It is not going to change. No matter who thinks it is \"Good\" it isn't."}
{"text":"Really bad food! Service was good but we could not eat the microwaved frozen fish they put on our plates! All for only $95, gee thanks! Please don't waste your money here. There is way better food in the world, trust me!"}
{"text":"5 stars for SERVICE!  Jane was amazing!  We went for a late lunch on Valentine's Day and although the restaurant was full, there was no wait.  After Jane introduced herself, she started explaining the menu.  The menu!  At Red Lobster of all places!  Since neither of us were wearing glasses and by appearances would \"seem\" of average intelligence - it immediately \"set me off.\"  (In truth I arrived agitated from bad experience at the Chandler location two years ago, only back due to a gift card.)  Okay, okay...calming down...her explanation was informative, her demeanor pleasant, and we ended up taking a couple of her suggestions.    Lunch was okay: a shared appetizer, strawberry lemonade, pineapple rum drink and two entrees with baked potatoes and salad.  None of it was remarkably good or bad, but a \"nudge\" better than average considering the price point at $45 before tip.  For me Jane was the star!"}
{"text":"It's extremely doubtful we'll ever go back!  Nope - Not - Decided!  What was wrong?  A bit of everything!  First off, my seat had a \"butt crater!\"  Normally I would have asked for a different booth, butt (ha,ha) we had waited the better part of 40 minutes, we were hungry, and there were no available tables in sight.  So then I had to make a decision, sit \"in\" the crater or balance myself on the \"high part.\"  As if that wasn't bad enough (it was,) the downward spiral continued: the smallest salad you've ever seen served in a \"papa bear's\" size bowl, the up-charge for a cup of soup when substituting for the salad (nearly full price,) and then it's watery and tasteless, an appetizer that looked much better in pictures, and entrees without taste and texture!  For the two of us, it was an $80 disappointment."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful time at Lobsterfest. We had Georgia as our server, she is fabulous and really takes care of you. The food was very good, we had a lot of lobster on this night and splurged. We left full and satisfied with what we had. Of course the dinner rolls are just amazing."}
{"text":"I give this Red Lobster an honest 4 stars because every time I go there I receive great customer service from the moment I enter until the moment I leave. However, I didn't give it five stars because the servers can be hit or miss. Don't get me wrong, the majority of the time we have excellent service from the wait staff but every now and then you get one that lacks equal attention among tables.   I actually decided to open a Yelp account and start my own reviews because I felt the prior reviews where rather harsh. Yes, Red Lobster is a chain, but the food has always been delicious and the customer service still beats everything in the area. Trust me, I'm a local and unless you want to travel all the way to McCormick & Schmick's near Maryland and Flamingo, this is your best bet. I'd like to see a previous complainant tell me a better place nearby this location to go for some great tasting seafood."}
{"text":"We gave this place one more try but we're disappointed.  My husband couldn't eat his crab sandwich.  There was a glob in the center of the bread, they didn't bother to spread it out.  They also use miracle whip. Yuck.  My calamari was good but the clams and fried broccoli were not.  We won't be back.  I he server was attentive, that's the only reason  I gave them two stars."}
{"text":"Red Lobstet is a excellent restaurant for seafood.The service is good and I would recommend this resturant to my friends"}
{"text":"Names matter to us apparently not to Red Lobster.   When I gave my husband's name for our reservation I saw that it was spelled wrong when it was being typed in by the lady at the receiving station. When I politely told her she spelled it wrong, she said, \"It's okay. It's going to alert that (pointing to the device she gave me) anyway.\"   What the lady doesn't realize is that the way she spelled my husband's name makes it a whole 'nother word."}
{"text":"I love it when you walk into a Restaurant and see four or five tables available and they tell you it will be 15-20 min wait...Not!  I arrived see tables and cannot sit down. Is the manager aware of this?  Where is the manager?  I think if I had 3 stars I would be working hard to accommodate on a busy or what should be a busy night.  Service was great but the food was not fresh. Crabfest?  Crab King and Snow were both soft shell which tells me that it was not fresh. Too bad we have to spend $120 between two people and get this."}
{"text":"Definitely had a great meal for the first time in a long time at a \"chain\" restaurant! Our Red Lobster visits at other locations were awful, bad food and bad service, but today that all changed here! Chris B., our server was on his A-game and made our visit wonderful and it was a nice way to start the new year :) Food was fresh and hot and he had our drinks taken care of before we could even ask! Today really changed my mind about my previous feelings about Red Lobster, thanks Chris! And not to mention, I sure missed those cheddar biscuits!"}
{"text":"I had an absolutely wonderful time here this past weekend with my family. To start, the restaurant graciously entertained my request for a last-minute reservation (thank you to my fellow Yelpers for the s/o about potential wait times!!). On the phone and in person, the servers were warm, friendly and altogether delightful! Our waitress, Vivian, was sweet and very welcoming! We ordered the seaside shrimp trio, the shrimp linguini alfredo, the cajun chicken linguini alfredo and the maple-glazed chicken. Came with absolutely delicious caesar salads (no meat) and of course the renowned biscuits! The food was spectacular and the portions plentiful (though a bit pricey). To add, we were there for a special occasion and they offered ice cream and a song for us which was so kind especially given that they were not told in advance.   In sum: stupendous service, delicious food (it's a real feat to finish any of these meals, except the maple-glazed chicken) and a lovely ambiance! I loved it."}
{"text":"Food was delicious as always. I went to celebrate my birthday with my family, my waitress Lisa was amazing!! She did a great job taking care of all details and listening to each request. Lisa sang a little happy birthday song to me, she made my night!! Thank you so much for making my night even more special :)"}
{"text":"I know what you're thinking - Heather...you're yelp elite and you're reviewing a chain? Really?   But darn it, their garlic shrimp scampi and cheddar bay biscuits are amazing. I may or may not have had excessive refills on both.  I went for the endless shrimp promotion - $16.99 for all you can eat shrimp and I was NOT disappointed. I may not look it but trust me - I CAN EAT.   My favorite varieties were the garlic shrimp scampi (obviously) and just the regular grilled variety. The coconut shrimp was way too sweet for my taste.   As far as decor and service goes, it's on par with the other chain restaurants in the area.  Overall, Red Lobster is becoming one of my favorite chains."}
{"text":"Had lunch today with my mom and sister. We split 2 appetizers. We had the seafood stuffed mushrooms,that we had had before. They were delicious, and always are. Then we tried the mussels for the first time. OMG they were so wonderful.  I can't even describe how good they were!!!  We all loved them."}
{"text":"Service could have been better. My friend and I had seafood dip with chips as an appetizer it was okay. After I had crab linguine it was super salty so I'm not try that again. I also had a strawberry mojito. For desert I had a cookie with chocolate inside and a scoop of ice cream. (I forgot the name)   What bother me the most was the fact that I asked for water twice. The second time I was more upset cause he handle us the check and seem to forgotten my request. He didn't offer us desserts I had to ask for it myself. He didn't check up on us to see how we were doing. (Ran out of bread and needed refills) This was during lunch.. It wasn't busy.. No excuses.. I love red lobster just not this location."}
{"text":"This was my first time at Red Lobster (omg, i know, unbelievable!). I'm not a huge fan of seafood...aside from sushi (yum).   Anyways, I was here last weekend for our friend's birthday event. Our friend mentioned that he attempted to book for reservations for 7pm for 12 people, but they wouldn't allow it - they said they cannot guarantee a spot, and suggested to come earlier. He asked for 5:30pm, and they suggested they have other groups around the same time and suggested to come at 5pm to help ensure a spot will be saved. To me, having to deal with this big headache to reserve a spot for your bday at such a widely know restaurant chain is absurd. We ended up waiting for over an hour before being seated.  Once we were seated, i was overwhelmed with all the seafood options available and immediately looked for the non-seafood portion of the menu. I saw everyone else got seafood, so i decided to change up my order to the Salmon New Orleans with Caesar Salad, mashed potatoes and broccoli.  After waiting for another 20-30 minutes, our food was finally served. The food was actually tasty. It was topped with a few tender shrimp, in a spicy Tabasco-like sauce. I was satisfied with every bite. I haven't tried the other food yet, but i would be interested to find out if it's all just as good.  To sum up, the service for large groups was terrible, but the Salmon New Orleans was satisfying. I give it 3 stars."}
{"text":"This place is ok not the best food ever but when it come to serving a martini why u buy dollar store Martini glass and charge me about 12 for a little ass drink that has no Alcohol In it  so sad won't be back"}
{"text":"It's been about 3 years since my last visit and it's nice to see that things have remained consistent. Decor, menu and even the waitstaff have remained largely unchanged! We arrived at 7pm on a Friday night and were told it would be a 30 minute wait. There's a St Louis Bar and Grill right next door so we dropped in for a drink while we waited. Exactly 30 minutes later and our buzzer went off (impressive)! I already knew I wanted the all-you-can-eat shrimp so I didn't even look at the menu. The wasabi soy shrimp was a big hit, and we ordered a second round. The shrimp linguine was scrummy, creamy deliciousness, but since I wanted to get my value's worth I didn't want to fill up on pasta (I'd probably order this as a whole main meal next time)! The garlic shrimp was pretty good and the hand breaded shrimp was deep fried goodness. Our waiter even let us try some of the items not included in the deal, like the coconut shrimp served with a creamy pineapple dip (I loved it, my friend thought was too sweet), and a spicy shrimp. By this time I was ready to pop and had quite literally all I could eat.  It was pretty obvious that the grilled shrimp was previously frozen, not fresh, but hey we are nowhere near an ocean so what do you expect? The wine list is ridiculously small, but reasonably priced. Where else can you get a $28 bottle of Pinot Grigio at a restaurant? It was surprisingly good, but for a seafood restaurant I would have expected a lot more white wines on the menu. And, I suppose this wouldn't be a complete review unless I mentioned the cheesy herb biscuits. They are probably the best thing here, and worth a visit just to try them (again and again)!"}
{"text":"Service was great!! Ugh! Bugs in window seals on each side where we're sitting, debris in the backs of booth seats! Dirty packaged up knife! Manager please! Thanked me for pointing these deficiencies out to him! Cleaning started quickly!! But the catfish was great!!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed tonight, first off 1/2 the restaurant had no air conditioner working and of course that's the side we sat on, made it uncomfortable to enjoy dinner. Service was extremely slow, took 20 mins after order was placed to get salads. Only saving grace was once our entrees finally arrived, they were good. Again disappointed in a place we like."}
{"text":"Great customer service. I ordered chicken and noticed it wasn't fully cooked so I asked the server to take it back to recook it. They brought me back a brand new plate of food, not just the chicken, even though I had already eaten the pasta and the mashed potatoes. Then the manager came to speak to me and apologized for the inconvenience, and they gave me a free dessert on the house. No business is perfect, but the way they resolved the issue was just outstanding!"}
{"text":"Gross... the only great thing about my meal was the chedder biscuits. I knew by the look of my meal when it came to the table I was going to get food poisoning. I WAS RIGHT."}
{"text":"Personally, I am not an advocate for most large chain restaurants, so this will be one of the few reviews you will see of mine for a chain.   With that being said, what can I say about Red Lobster (RL) that hasn't already been said. You get what you expect to get at Red Lobster. The food is good, not particularly great, and is slightly overpriced for the quality.   I had the skewered garlic shrimp, while most individuals in my party ordered the snow crab. The shrimp was well cooked and season but ordinary. Personally, I thought that the side dish of rice was the highlight of my meal. It was well seasoned and textured. The snow crab, which I had bites of, was good! Dip it with a little bit of butter, close your eyes, chew and voilà, you're at a 5-star seafood restaurant.   The service was good, we dearly promptly and proudly. One of the seafood specialists seemed mildly condescending, but our waitress was well spoken and kind. This particular location had great artwork, interior design and lighting, all of which I was pleased to dwell in.   All in all, RL is what is, and they know that. You can expect good food that is slightly overpriced. RL bats 5th in the batting order.  By that I mean, they don't hit many homeruns, but they consistently get on base."}
{"text":"Although I'm not a big seafood eater I have to hand it to Red Lobster for making me a sea food lover everytime I go through.  My ex-girlfriend and a couple friends of ours, we have this tradition of going to Red Lobster every summer during lobster season. Usually we go to the one up in Sudbury but this summer since we are all in Southern Ontario (and the fact that I work in the same building) we decided to hit this one up.  The atmosphere is typical of any Red Lobster and though appropriately themed the place was also well-kept. I think the biggest mess was around my spot because when I eat... I EAT! (That sounded so sexual, oh gawd)  The food was great. But that is also typical of a Red Lobster. The one thing I noticed, however, is that Southern Ontario chain restaurants are generally better at what they do than in the North.  The service was great! One strange quirk is that I ordered a dessert to be brought to my ex after her meal since it was her birthday and when we got the bills they seperated them all and put the cake on her bill... I was picking up her bill anyways but how strange that they would have put it on her bill when someone else requested it for her. Sheesh!  All in all a great red lobster. Would definitely reccomend it to someone looking for a Red Lobster. It was worth the drive downtown from North York to hit this Red Lobster."}
{"text":"Poor red lobster seems the new owners need to get a grip on prices quantity and friendly fast service. Been here for one hour already waiting on food & it is not even busy.  It began when we waited at the hostess stand for ten minutes before anyone acknowledged us. The food needs attention. Sad they slide down"}
{"text":"Gross, nothing tasted fresh, no flavor, only gave me three legs for crab legs, felt ripped off. Got sick after 30 min of eating there and was sick till the next day. Never again."}
{"text":"Avoid;service so so , didnt have their  advertised dish on first page of menu, out of that kind of shrimp. Mother had shrimp linguine, weird, plate was hot but food cool? She sent it back, second time was OK but it was her birthday. I was so disappointed, they never brought her anything at all for her birthday. It wasn't crowded. It will be a cold day in hell before I come back!!!  Tawni F r server time bout 5:15 Monday, Red Lobster at 7921 w Bell   ED"}
{"text":"Everything was pretty tasty! But I loved our waiter Allan! He was very nice, polite, and attentive. He made the experience wonderful."}
{"text":"So, it's Red Lobster and if you eat at one, you eat at all of them.  Your typical chain restaurant but the problem I have is that some of their dishes are unnecessarily too salty.  Maybe my palate is spoiled thanks to Luke Wholey's Wild Alaskan Grille.  Oh, dammit...yum! Sorry, I had a moment.  A few weeks ago I ordered take out on my way home because I wanted seafood and I wanted it nicely packed and ready to eat immediately when I walked in the door.  I haven't had pasta in a while so shrimp alfredo was my thrill for the evening.  Along with it came the infamous cheddar bay biscuits and a salad.   When I arrived home and unpacked my order, I noticed the pasta barely had enough sauce on it with a few shrimp scattered about and the tossed salad I ordered ended up being a caesar salad with some aged lettuce and dried parmesan cheese.  I mean, the entire meal looked pathetic.  I reached out to Red Lobster and they ended up sending me a gift card to make it up to me.   Today, I was in the area and decided to use my gift card.  I'm happy to report that my meal was error free and the service was great.  Some of their dishes are too salty but I like the fact that they offer a wide selection of entrees which cater to your wants/needs whether you're going healthy or having a \"to heck with it\" moment.  My fish was cooked just right and tasted fresh.    While I don't see myself as a true \"regular\" at Red Lobster, I won't rule them out entirely.  It's the service that I receive with a smile and their willingness to own up to and fix their mistakes scores them points in my book."}
{"text":"I don't normally like to review \"chain\" restaurants because it is usually cookie cutter service with food to match.  In my opinion, it's never really over the top.  However, on New Years Eve we decided to have an early family dinner at Red Lobster.  The wait was expected with the holiday crowd but the hostess was polite, apologized for the delay.  They let us give our name and leave to do some shopping for an hour so we didn't have to stand in the lobby.  We returned and were seated at our table.  We glanced over the menu and then our waiter, Ryan, arrived.  He greeted us, asked what we would like to drink.  Did we have plans for the evening.  All just being polite, right? However, he was different...he was sincere.  Anyway...we get our drinks, then he takes our order.  My husband had a few questions about a new menu selection and this young man (I emphasize YOUNG) is answering our questions and giving us suggestions making me feel like I was in a 5 star restaurant.  All through dinner, he checked on us, was very polite and friendly without acting overly familiar.  Nice...professional...and inviting.  Each time he left our table, I made a comment to my husband and he agreed...we both were impressed.  I had to ask him some questions, I had to find out where he was trained...what restaurant had he worked in before? Maybe on Mt. Washington or perhaps he's a culinary student? Well, I asked and he said he started out bussing tables and moved up to server.    Okay, I know, by now your saying how was the food...right? Well, we all know Red Lobster's specialty is seafood.  So, I had seafood and it was cooked perfectly and the cheddar biscuits made me want to tuck one in my pocket for later, as usual :)  I don't want to take that away from the chef because he cooked perfect meals on a very busy night...BUT, this review is for Ryan.  With an attitude like that and strong attention to customer service and details he is sure to go far! Please visit this place and ask for him...you'll see."}
{"text":"This is the first red lobster i been to, the food here is SOOO VERY SALTY!!! especially the lobster and the shrimps here!!!! the biscuit tasted salty too!!!!!! WHY YOU PUT SO MUCH SALT??? is salt really that cheap? D: other than the salty sea food, the lobster pizza and the pasta is good (salty lobster and shrimp in the pasta)!!!"}
{"text":"It had been a very long time since I've eaten at Red Lobster and so I wanted to try it out again. Wasn't too pleased with my visit and with the dishes that we ordered. Dishes were too small for the price that we paid. We came during the Shrimp fest, but decided to just stick with lobster and steak. We both ordered the rock lobster and steak with a side of rice. The rice was literally 2 bites. I felt like I had to fill up on the biscuits. Our server was nice but we found it hard to get her attention. Maybe it was just this location, but I don't remember my Red Lobster experiences in the past being this bad."}
{"text":"Every time my GF & I go out to this place, the service is WONDERFUL! Brian is one of the best servers I've ever met & takes care of us every time. Flat out Best restaurant I've ever eaten at"}
{"text":"Upon our visit on 12/06/17 we were completely satisfied with our entire dining experience. The Clam Chowder was superb... Our server Wayne M. was extremely knowledgeable about the entire menu and any and all specials that were applicable.  Thank You Again Wayne and also to the entire staff of Red Lobster...."}
{"text":"This restaurant has been in the area since the early 1980's.  However, they've been keeping up with renovations so it's clean and up to date.  I hadn't been to this particular restaurant in 25 years so I was pleased to see that it was doing well.  We arrived just before the dinner rush, so we were seated immediately.  The service was excellent.  Our water and iced tea were kept full and the warm bread was replenished.  I had the fish and chips.  My husband had the salmon.  My son had the seafood platter.    My husband felt his portion was too small, the fish was overcooked, and the pilaf was too salty.  He felt we paid too much for what we got.  He was also unimpressed with the beer selection.  He prefers brew pubs.  At Red Lobster he drank iced tea.  My son, who is 11, gobbled up his food and exclaimed over how good it was.  But he's a kid, and he tends to have different tastes.  I felt my fish and chips were perfect and while it was expensive, it was competitive with other restaurants.  It's always pricey to eat out, and if you want seafood you have to pay for it.  If I want to run out to a family restaurant for fish and chips and a glass of iced tea, this place is fine.  My husband says he is still looking for the right seafood restaurant."}
{"text":"Typical red lobster except for the wait during peak times. Always a long wait !! The lobby and bar area is very small so you feel like sardines waiting for a table."}
{"text":"Took my daughter for her birthday . The restaurant was only 50 filled but we still had to wait 35 minutes.  Service was average . We o had endless shrimp however reorders were taking 20 minutes which was annoying . The chicken Alfredo with linguine was excellent , the chicken was extremely moist. All in all we were pleased with the food not the wait time  our waitress did try to stop by frequently"}
{"text":"I am so happy they aren't keeping this crab and scallop \"pot\".  It was overly messy and no return of flavor.  Better off just having steamed crab legs instead.  Overall, Red Lobster is a great place for me to get my crab fix when I need it.  There isn't any other affordable place in town to support my cravings."}
{"text":"The food was cooked phenomenally and our waitress Brittany was super friendly, very attentive, and even remembered our complicated order without writing it down. Drinks were always full and biscuit bowl was never empty! Our medium rare steaks were cooked perfectly."}
{"text":"Food was good, service was GREAT. Thank you to Derek (the bartender) ...he should be serving fine dining."}
{"text":"Being that I am a vegetarian, there are not many dishes at Red Lobster I can eat anymore. However, I will forever be grateful for the creation of cheddar bay biscuits. My husband and I sometimes make a meal out of side salads and their biscuits! Sounds crazy yet tastes delicious. The service at this location is average, not great but not horrible either. It's close to Old Town Scottsdale and is easy to locate. If you're in the mood for a big chain meal, this isn't a bad option."}
{"text":"Went to eat for dinner just 3 people.  We waited for over 40 minutes.  I walked through the dining room to use the restrooms and counted over 18 empty tables.  Ridiculous!  We were going to sit in the bar, as there were empty tables in there and was told we could only sit at the bar.  Usually you can seat yourself in the bar area and grab an empty table to bypass the long wait.  I'm giving 2 stars as the waitress was really nice.   She was double sat and she was hustling.  There were a lot of dirty tables as well.  Get it together people."}
{"text":"It's Friday night May 11th and I absolutely freaking love this bar staff these two guy are one of the main reasons that me and my wife keep coming back to this location keep it up boys, you have my approval. Best company ever while I'm sitting at the bar eating/ drinking my dinner."}
{"text":"We have not been to Red lobster in years and we came because we had a gift card. Well now I know why we stopped coming. The biscuits were good, salad was not. My pasta was ok, felt a bit smaller then the normal. My boyfriend ordered crab legs that were like straight rubber. We told the waitress and she told us it was because they changed the cooking method of the crab legs. But I know the reason they were rubber like was because they were overcooked. The manager brought out another order for us but it was still over cooked and she never apologized. They didn't even give us a discount on our check. Also the waitress, while serving us slid the plate down to my daughter and it also fell in her lap. But the waitress stopped it. Which she is lucky or I would have sued. But never again will we come back."}
{"text":"OMG went there for Father's Day, Page the manager was off and that was not a good thing. The service was so slow. I think we were there half the night. First they told us that our party of 6 would have to wait at least an hour for a table. Ok we get it, its Father's Day. Low and behold, 20 mins later we are sitting at the table. That was great, but we might as well have just sat in the waiting area because that's the fastest they were the rest of the night. Refills on drinks took forever. The waitress described the whole menu page by page like a slide show even after I told her it was not necessary because we get the same thing every time. Prices had a approximate 4.00 increase and now there is even an upcharge on the Ultimate feast to duplicate an item. Crazy crazy. This is a go to place for my son, husband and brother in law for there special occasions because of the crab legs. I have never been a fan, but hey it's their day. But after this visit I may have to persuade them harder to try somewhere else in the future."}
{"text":"Had a chance to go here today for lunch and I left more than happy with my meal.    I sat at the bar and received excellent service from the young lady working.  She was quick to greet me and was efficient every step of the dining process.  I especially liked that she was quick to grab me some warm cheese bread.  She didn't \"pretend\" she forgot or didn't know that stuff is like crack and that's why people come to Red Lobster in the first place!!!  I digress...so the service was great.  So, yeah, the bread was good, the cup of clam chowder I ordered for an app. was great, and I would recommend it to anyone, even if your not a big chowder fan.  I did the whole build your own meal thing, and chose the steak (for a $2 up-charge) and the shrimp alfredo with a side a fries; yea I know, kinda carb-heavy.  All the food tasted great and was up to my expectations.  My only complaint was that the portions were a little light for $19.    Oooook, so I feel like I've pontificated long enough on the ups and downs of Red Lobster.  If you like mid-grade, over-priced, small-portioned seafood, this is the place for you!"}
{"text":"It's what you want from a red lobster by the mall. 8:30 pm on a Wednesday  and we were seated right away. Server was knowledge and attentive. No local beer selection but lots of food for the $ . Hard to find sea food around here so I'll take it. I would have given 4 stars but the bath room was not so clean and had an odor of a sour mop."}
{"text":"My food was horrible. The only reason we came was for a friend's birthday. Refills were few and far between. Manager did apologize for the extremely salty drawn butter, offered a different lobster tail for the one I didn't like, but it still didn't replace the fact that it was tougher than leather. Also, our appetizer came out the same time our dinner came out!  This is a major pet peeve!   I will not be returning!"}
{"text":"Sherri was an outstanding waitress/bartender.  Even though it was a hectic time at the restaurant,she was extremely nice, made great recommendations and made sure our orders came in exactly as we wanted them.  Best red lobster experience ever!"}
{"text":"Really good food enjoy seafood here are waitress was pretty  slow where we sat back in the right corner. But food came out in a good  amount of time no issues from me for the kitchen they did a awesome job with hiw busy it is here.would come back again but maybe new waitress really dont see here much our talk to us much"}
{"text":"Well, visiting my Sis with her two little munchkins.. it is very hard for her to get out and have dinner...  We stopped in here, because usually you can expect a pretty consistent experience with this chain which also includes Olive Gardens (you wondered why you always see them together, huh?) anyway, where to begin..  with the good.. it was clean and the food was consistent...    The service? Not so much.. first of all, the entire place was pretty empty because we arrived at an odd hour and yet the hostess sat us - THE PEOPLE WITH THE THREE YEAR OLD AND THE BABY! next to other people.. and seem to sit all the people close to the kitchen entrance!!!   #1, if you have room, seat the people with the kids and babies (even if it is me) AWAY from other patrons..  they also gave us a booth for four and put the hammock for the baby seat in the aisle, so everyone kept bumping the baby! OMG, I was so mad!  If anyone from RL reads this, please train your employees to seat properly... THINK PEOPLE!  #2, if you can help it, don't sit all the people or any of the people near the kitchen door.. those tables are for last minute guests or over flow when a place is too crowded! WHY would you put everyone there...  The waitress was nice, but she checked on us about every 2 minutes... there IS such a thing as over doing it... give us some privacy and let us talk... geesh!  Not the best experience I have had for sure...."}
{"text":"Our most recent visit on 8/10 was pretty bad. We ordered an appetizer- we usually get the lobster artichoke dip, but opted to try something new. We decided on the calamari and vegetables. It was suppose to come with marinara and ranch dip, which we didn't get. Our server never came back to check on us, so we were just picking at the appetizer until we could get her attention..which never happened. Some one else came and delivered our main entrees and that was when we asked about the dip...by then it was too late, so we told them just to put it in a to go container. I ran out of iced tea twice and it took forever to get a refill. As for our main entrees, food was bland when it's usually full of flavor. I don't know what was going on that night, but we were disappointed with our last experience. Definitely was not worth the $80 we spent there..."}
{"text":"Went to the one in Toronto, haven't been to a Red Lobster in such a long time. The biscuits are my FAVOURITE part! But the rest was just overly salty.  I miss having red lobster the real stuff the way it use to be lol. But the biscuits were still so so good!!"}
{"text":"Customer Service is horrible! We were having a family day and stop by red lobster for dinner. We waited 20 minutes to be seated and that was ok. When we were seated we waited another 20 minutes and did not even receive WATER!!! I left to speak with the hostess and waitress still did not show up. We decided to leave because  we were not going to spend money at a establishment with poor service. I spoke to manager and she was nice and gave a gift card. I really hope they address the situation so it doesn't happen again. Unfortunately, I will not be going again."}
{"text":"Great service! Great tasting fish! Great experience this evening! Scallops were superb as was the grilled salmon!"}
{"text":"I went to Red Lobster on a Sunday evening with my family. It was our first time. The interior was  beautiful. It had an old-ern feel to it. We had to wait about 15 mins for our table. The service was pretty good and the staff was very friendly. So formal and organized. Many food choices to choose from. Lobster to steak to shrimp. I ended up getting the \"Seaside Shrimp Trio\" ($22.99). My parents ended up getting their \"Strip and Rock Lobster\" ($39.99) and \"Lobster Shrimp and Salmon\" ($29.99). We were given this sort of soft garlic sweet bread moments after we finished ordering. It was pretty good. Then came the salads. My caesar salad was really good. About 20 minutes after receiving our salads, our dishes came. The presentation of the dishes were nice. 2/3 of my \"trio\" was really salty. I really enjoyed my linguine though. Very creamy and flavourful. My parents enjoyed their steak and mashed potatoes. The lobster wasn't bad either. My mom's salmon was pretty plain but not horrible. Overall, the experience was great. It's just the saltiness that knocked off the star."}
{"text":"I went here on Thursday January 5th, 2012 for a late night dinner with my gf.  I have been going to Red Lobster from the age of 2 and I am pretty familiar with everything on their menu.    I've prolly been to Red Lobster over 75 times and I've made it a point to order the Clam Chowder each and every one of those times that I've dined there.  Lately I've increasingly become a fan of the crab and lobster dip they currently offer as an appetizer (see pics).   I ordered the peppered sirloin and coconut shrimp combo, with mashed potatoes as my side.  The peppered steak was a little over cooked for my liking, but served the purpose of satisfying my appetite for the evening.  The Caesar salad that was served ahead of time left a bit to be desired.  The shrimp was good, but  by the 5th coconut shrimp, I was kind of sick of them.  Like, i said, I've been going to Red Lobster my whole life, so I more than knew what I was getting food-wise, it was the crowd and the ambiance surrounding me that put a damper on the evening.  First, we were forced to squeeze into one of those cramped two-person booths, with little to no table and leg room.  Secondly, we were seated next to a birthday party of about 10 people.  Apparently they forgot that Red Lobster is a public establishment and that we are \"LIVING IN A SOCIETY!!\"  Because they acted as if they owned the place and were EXTREMELY loud and obnoxious - constantly walking around, snapping pictures left and right and seemed ready to burst out with laughter at the drop of a hat.  This was def. not what my date and I were hoping for on a Thursday night, and our entire Red Lobster experience would've been better if we had simply ordered it to go or sat in the bathroom and ate instead - no really.  At least it would've been quiet.    Our server was a heavy set gentleman with glasses, with a kind disposition.  However, we were more than ready to leave by the time he finally arrived with the check, and it felt like another 5-10 minutes before he finally returned to our table run our credit card (a pet peeve of mine; I mean we asked for the check so we are clearly ready to go.  Why does it take forever to come back and TAKE our money/card) so we could leave him a tip and get the heck out of there?    The food was, well Red Lobster - the dream combination of upscale, overpriced, chain seafood.  Unfortunately, the environment and ambiance we were subjected to was closer to a nightmare!"}
{"text":"Our son wanted a lobster and steak dinner before leaving to go back to his base in Tx. We chose Red Lobster and what a mistake we made.  The service to begin with was great, our waitress was kind and right on top of things until the arrival of our food and it was downhill from there.     We ordered a couple of appetizers which were good and then immediately we were served our salad's, A little wait would have been nice. Then our main course arrived and the steaks that were ordered medium came out so rare you wondered if they even touched the grill and they came without the lobster. The server placed them on the table, said enjoy and left before we could tell him that we didn't receive our lobsters and that the steaks were undercooked. We finally got the attention of the waitress and the manager came over and asked what the problem was, which we told him. He apologized and took the steaks to have them cooked the way we ordered them which was medium, and also stated that they were a little behind with the lobster. The other dish that was ordered was a grilled flounder which was so distasteful due to whatever seasoning they are now using, it appears on everything as the lobster even had the seasoning on it. Literally 2 bites was taken of the flounder and that was it. As far as the waitress there was no \"how is your meal?\", or \"Is something wrong with your meal?\" from the waitress. She did not mention once if there was a problem with the flounder as it was moved to the side uneaten throughout the entire meal. As a matter of fact once the steaks' were returned to the kitchen the service turned in the other direction and was awful. Needless to say we will not be going back to this Red Lobster again, nor recommending it to anyone. This has to go on the list as one of the worst."}
{"text":"We took my best friend to eat for her bday, nothing big...just us girls...  I ordered the Malibu hurricane drink, which was good!  We had our 'build your own' appetizers got the escargot and calamari and they were okay as well.  The food we got were a good portion of everything but some of our dishes were a bit too salty but was still filling.  I would rate our food about 3.5 stars.  Our server was attentive, just seemed a little impatient or he wasn't having a good day.  He was still courteous...just didn't express very well.    Possibly because it's a food chain, hard to give ratings on the food as it is pretty generic.  I would give an overall 3.5 stars which we can't give, but we were full when we left so it did what we went there for.  Full bellies and great company was a success!"}
{"text":"Service here is excellent but the food is mediocre at best. Red Lobster is never my first choice for seafood. The only reason I went is because my Mom likes it. I prefer my seafood fried harder then they fry it and what's with the lack of slaw? Who serves fried fish without coleslaw. Lastly, they have a very limited selection of fish. No bueno!"}
{"text":"Red Lobster used to be a fancy dining experience my wealthy grandfather used to treat us to. Having not been in years, till I went to a red lobster in Miami. Which was nothing short of fast food.   But here at this location, it was more like a nice and rather fancy restaurant. So i'm guessing location makes the difference. Maybe their fancier in Pennsylvania... or just dumpy in Miami.   My mother insisted we come here for the endless shrimp. I really didn't want to come from the endless shrimp memory in Florida. But presently surprised.   The shrimp wasn't jumbo... at 16 dollars I didn't expect it to be. But it was good eats. The spicy shrimp (can't remember the name of it) will burn your tounge off. Loved it!  I'm glad my experience here has changed my mind about red lobster."}
{"text":"Lorraine was our server for lunch today. The food was perfect and I ordered endless shrimp and she was there to fill me up every time. The food was absolutely awesome and I really do love this location. Thanks lorraine for making it nice for us. Endless shrimp is the way to go lol."}
{"text":"last time I came here was last year... shame on me for not leaving a review sooner. my husband and I were dining here for valentines day last year. after eating we paid our bill and left a tip which was 20% of our bill. while walking out of the restaurant our waiter walked behind us and said sarcastically \"ohhh thank you so much for the tip\" waving his hands in the air like he had an attitude about how much tip we gave him. it was the most rudest most disrespectful thing he could have done. 20% tip from your bill is more then enough if you ask me. normally a person will tip 10% - 15% of their bill. we never came back again."}
{"text":"Updating my review: quality has really dropped at this location.  Past 2 times I've gone, the fish has been dry and not that exciting, and the broccoli has been wilted and downright unappetizing.  Service has gotten slower too while prices have gone up."}
{"text":"We were there for my daughters birthday we will never go back again. I had the ultimate feast the crab was thin little joke peices with hardly no crab in it. When i asked to exchange the breaded shrimp for shrimp on a stick they charged me more   The waiter kept trying to up grade us on everyting.   I asked for a sluce if cake for my daughters 15 th birthday they wanted to charge us mire we spent $200 and no cake for my daughter any were else we go they would provide cake wer you lost alot if custemers today we will never go never go back  also the restaurants we under construction looked like crap   Hated our  time there"}
{"text":"We ordered take out last night and I was very disappointed in the quality of food.  Understanding it is take out and not eating in the restaurant, there are still certain things I expect.  Our biscuits tasted like they were from the day before and our salad was brown and slimey."}
{"text":"We come here every now and again and my wife always gets the shimp trio and enjoys it.  I always change what I get and this time I got some double lobster dish.  It was stuffed and really good.  I don't care for the butter but the rest of it is good.  All you can eat biscuits too!"}
{"text":"Met up with old friends for lunch.  Food was surprisingly alright. I had shrimp skewers with rice and broccoli.  It was nice and light lunch."}
{"text":"I am a Red Lobster fan and enjoy going to the Decatur location. The service is great and the staff  are very friendly. The food is the best and they always have specials.we are going tonight."}
{"text":"Went here Tues for dinner with friends siresley u let us down the only 2 good things we're blackend salmon and u lobster mashed potatoes everything else taested bland no flavour like even the mashed potatoes we would put garlic in the worst time ever"}

{"text":"Scott did an excellent job as our server.  Couldn't ask for better experience.  Food was great too."}
{"text":"I was in the other day and sat at the bar where Wayne was tending.  Everything was just as I would have expected for this establishment.  The fish was great, service was great, cocktails were made well.  This is my goto brand for fresh fish in a low key atmosphere every time.  Thanks Wayne!  See you soon."}
{"text":"I haven't been to a Red Lobster in years! I wanted to take my mom out for a birthday lunch, and she wanted some seafood so we trucked on down to Red Lobster by Chinook mall!  The decor was a little dated- and the server had mentioned that the roof had recently caved in due to water damage. So they should definitely do some updating in here. However, it had the fun decor typical of a Red Lobster, an lots of comfy booths, so we were fine with that.  Our server wasn't overly friendly and was obviously pushing us to purchase more, which kind of rubbed me the wrong way from the get-go. The food came out quickly though, and she kept our waters full. We ordered some appetizers- the coconut shrimp, calamari, stuffed mushrooms, and another type of breaded shrimp. My mom has a severe pineapple allergy, and they were great about letting the kitchen know.  I found the meal to be really greasy- but hey, all we ordered were fried appetizers! I kind of wish there were some veggies on the side or something, but not all places do that with their fried apples.  The coconut shrimp was delicious, but the calamari was meh and the other fried shrimp needed a funner dip.   Overall, it was kind of a \"meh\" experience. I think it'll be a few years before I check out a Red Lobster again."}
{"text":"Went here last week with some friends. I am not a seafood eater so I want expecting much but I was excited to see Steak on the menu.   I ordered medium well and it was over well done, little flavor too.   I asked the waitress if they carried Ciders and she said no. So I ordered a different drink, then when I was helping my husband choose a beer what do I see?.... Angry Orchard on the menu.... last I checked this is a cider.  The only positive side of the dinner was the amazing bread. But sadly even for my seafood loving husband we don't plan on going back to Red Lobster again."}
{"text":"great food and fivevstar service from roy, that man was on the ball drinks ready before we asked plates ready for our meal before it came out,and he even bagged up biscuts to take home way to go roy you made our dinning experince perfect."}
{"text":"Went on a busy Saturday evening, but the decision to go was a huge mistake. After finally deciding what to order after flipping through the menu 5 times trying to make sense of the large and unorganized menu the waiter was extremely pushy to me and many of my party members.  The waiter told us the portion for one item was too small and we should go for the larger, more expensive option.  He consistently tried to push another item for $3 more for double the food, until another party member told him to stop that we didn't want it.  When I ordered, I thought to make it simple, list what I want and the side.  I didn't realize in the sea of confusion that the crab cakes + salmon dish it comes with a salad (since it lists it nowhere on the menu), and when I tried to substitute it with a side dish, the waiter said \"you already have broccoli\" and wouldn't let me check the menu again, just reciting the sides.  So I guess I just have to take the sides he has by his word.  It's ok though, they completely forgot the third side I ordered anyways.  The food was mushy and honestly just what you expect from a chain.  When I was finished, the waiter tapped my shoulder and just picked all my dishes, not even asking if I was done.  I found the unpleasant pushiness of the waiters to order dishes and leave such a turn off that I will never eat here again."}
{"text":"Lobster fest was amazing! Our server, John, was fantastic and the food was great! Friendly, awesome staff all around."}
{"text":"Red Lobster can easily be written off as just another big chain restaurant.  But, really it is one of the more affordable options to get seafood that still tastes delicious.  I'll admit- I'm not the biggest fan of our friends in the sea.  But, I can handle a little shrimp and lobster occasionally.   This location is BUSY every time I visit.  Wait times for a Friday or Saturday night are generally estimated to be 40-45 minutes.  But, really, we have only every waited 20 minutes tops which leads me to believe that they are estimating high so guests don't get angry.  Since this is a chain that most people are familiar with, I will focus on the service aspect of this location.  On our most recent trip, we were blown away by the awesomeness of our server.  He seemed to be balancing many tables at once, including a large party of about 10.  Yet, our drinks were always full and he checked in to see how we were doing multiple nights.  Sometimes this does not even happen at high end restaurants!   Although I hate the crowded waiting area of Red Lobster, I do enjoy visiting this location because we have never been treated poorly and the food is always great."}
{"text":"Service was fine. The food is horrible. The lobster bisque had separated. I fear it was old and improperly heated. The fish was greasy and it was baked. The shrimp didn't look cooked all the way and the lobster tail is well... not the tender lobster meat I had in New England last week.   This place has something wrong with it. I have been peeing out of my butt since I left there today. Somebody needs to inspect this food."}
{"text":"I haven't been to a red lobster in years. There aren't any by me in Vegas and there are tons of other seafood places so that's probably why. However when visiting my family its a close option especially on Good Friday when we can't eat meat.   We arrived and were welcomed by a strong stench. We kept trying to  figure out what the odor was but luckily we were seated fairly quickly. Not the friendliest hostesses, pretty sure she didnt even say welcome or make eye contact until she sat Us.  We were seated and a few minutes later out server took our drink order. It took him a good 10 minutes before hr came back with our drinks. We ordered our food and he seemed irritated or something, like he didn't want to be at work. Anyways. The promptness of the service would definitely get a 0. By the time we got our food from the time we were seated it was 45 minutes. Thats a really long time considering they were not busy at all. In our section, shoot on our side of the restaurant there were only 4 other tables sat.   As for the food, we ordered thebUltimate Feast. It was pretty good and no complaints for the food. The biscuits are really yummy. Thats my 2 stars."}
{"text":"Had dinner  last night.  We had about a 20 minute wait.  Place was very busy.  Service was good.  Food was good, very hot when served.  All in all very pleased with our dinner."}
{"text":"Came for $22.99 endless shrimp.  5 options were available on my menu: Korean BBQ, Garlic, Hand-breaded, cheese-and-peppercorn, shrimp linguini.  But when I say 5, I mean the menu comes with 5 options. It seems like one of the menus we had listed a different set of options, but that menu was quickly taken away after the first order was made, and the one we were left with did not have a different selection. We did not attempt to ask for more menus.  First order comes with two orders of shrimp along with one side and one salad. Subsequent orders are placed one at a time.  Server was pro-active: recommended to get our next orders in when he brought them over so we didn't have to wait too long in between. Water re-fills came at a good pace as well, given that the food was quite thirst-inducing.  There seemed to be some inconsistency between different tables when it came to lemon slices with the glass of water, but that's a minor detail.  Washrooms are clean. Chopsticks are not available, so you will need to pack your own.  I enjoyed the korean BBQ shrimp and the peppercorn shrimp. Sizes are alright. Linguini came with a bit too much linguini and had an ... interesting ... combination of flavors between the pasta and the shrimp."}
{"text":"Ah Red Lobster.. What I have always thought as the standard for consistency in good dining experience, has really let me down this time! We ordered endless shrimp which started off a-ok like many other times I've been at red lobster. But when we got to like the 5th or 6th order, the shrimp started becoming either undercooked, overcooked, just overly small portion and tasting stale. The last garlic shrimp we ordered did not even have any liquid in it! It looks as if somebody accidentally dropped it on the floor, or the dish was leftover from someone else's table. In 10 years I have been at red lobster, this has NEVER happened. The last breaded shrimp I ordered had some that tasted stinky and rotten as well. Overall it was not a great experience and I would definitely not revisit at least this location."}
{"text":"Came here for a group function. The restaurant was being renovated so let's just call the decor \"under construction\".  The menu is large and features many seafood based options. Aside from the daily fresh options, all other seafood is portioned and pre-frozen so there are no modifications to the menu. It also means that the seafood itself is okay at best, and comes covered in sauces and seasonings to cover the fact that it is small and tasteless.  Probably the best item on the menu are the cheddar biscuits - everybody likes them and they come hot and fresh at the start.  Gluten free items are few and far between, but you can get by if you splurge. But in truth, for that price, you can do way better at a real seafood restaurant.  No hurry to go back ..."}
{"text":"I went to is this place, I went with everybody I went with Amy, Larry, aunt Faye,Irene, and Anne. I got the shrimp trio, Amy got the ultimate feast, Larry got the ultimate feast asparagus, aunt Faye got lobster Irene gotcrab, and Anne got shrimp  Will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Our waitress was friendly, but the 'fresh lobster' tasted rubbery - it had no flavor. The salmon was dry. We also caught that they tried to charge us for a drink we didn't order. $135 later, and our meal was not enjoyable."}
{"text":"Food was great,fast very good service the bar harbor lobster bake was really good i would go back soon"}
{"text":"Great food! OK service. Pricy lunch - overall a good lunch.  My husband + I went for lunch at this Red Lobster last week. We were seated immediately and our server, Debra, showed up shortly after. She was friendly, but she didn't point out the specials (as I heard her do for other patrons)  She took our orders for drinks, appetizer and lunch.   We ordered the lobster dip appetizer. It comes with tortilla chips and a small cup of pico de gallo.  The dip was tasty, hot and cheesy = perfect. The chips were thin and a little greasy. The pico de gallo was just OK    Debra brought some warm Cheddar Bay biscuits with our salads. The biscuits were good. The salad was fair. The dressing (blue cheese) tasted warm and bland, like it came from the dollar store.   It took a long time for our finished plate from the appetizer to be removed from the table. I don't know what the hold up was as the server did come back and forth to tend to other tables and passed up our plate a few times in the process.   We each ordered lobster tail entrees. I don't remember the exact names, but I had lobster tails with lobster Mac and cheese. My husband had lobster tails with lobster Alfredo. We were almost already full from the appetizer, salad and biscuits so the portion was more than enough for us. The lobster was very good. We are not food snobs so we don't know good lobster from not so good lobster, but we really enjoyed these lobster tails. The pastas were also wonderful. I ordered green beans as a side and they were very oily. The mashed potatoes were great, though. My husband ordered rice, but I guess the server heard \"fries\" because that's what he got. We told our server he had wanted rice and she brought out a portion of rice shortly after, not taking back the fries (bonus fries!) The rice and fries were very good, as well.   The restaurant wasn't very busy at the time. It was clean and pleasant. There is a tank by the entrance with live lobsters.   Our lunch bill came to about $90! Yes, for 2 people! This was for 2 entrees, 1 shared appetizer, 2 drinks and no dessert. Kind of pricey for lunch but we did have leftovers to bring home. Debra was so kind to bring us extra biscuits to take home, too.   We knew going in that Red Lobster wasn't cheap. We were celebrating (finished filing our taxes) so we felt we deserved a nice treat."}
{"text":"I have a fondness for Red Lobster that will never leave me. My mom used to take me there for special Friday lunches where I ate popcorn shrimp and coloured in kid menus. Thus, I still like going to Red Lobster!  We've been to this location multiple times - always good service. The biscuits are really good but as any good Red Lobster fan knows, if you ask for seconds you'll never finish your main meal. My boyfriend gets different \"feasts\" so I can't speak them. I ALWAYS get shrimp. In fact, my favourite time of year is Endless Shrimp. It is a good time to go as there is a lot of turn over with the shrimp, so it is generally fresh and tasty. I always order the shrimp alfredo and take it home for lunch the next day. Walt's shrimp are delish and my favourite are the coconut shrimp with pina colada dipping sauce.  Overall, I understand that Red Lobster is not a seafood fine dining experience BUT I can say I enjoy it for what it is and will be back for more shrimp!"}
{"text":"WOW. $15 four course meals(current promo)  I ordered 1. Potato bacon soup, 2. Caesar salad, 3. Coconut habanero shrimp, 4. Brownie a la mode.  Service was prompt and efficient, even a little shake of humor, no hiccups whatsoever.  Food, well, besides the cheddar bay biscuits hitting the spot, yes baked to perfect goodness. Send me out to my B.A.(biscuits anonymous) meeting, 'cause I'm officially an addict.   Soup was nice and perfectly HOT, the way I love it.   Salad, ehhh, not so perfect. I had my own learning experience to ask for dressing on the side in the future because it was drenched(I prefer my green leafs to be drenched 15% instead of 115%). with that said, I was full by the time they brought over my main entree.  Main, the idea of coconut and habanero (sweet, then kick in my mouth) is culinary-bipolar science and art goodness. Can we do this over with each shrimp? Thanks. I enjoyed some of the shrimps and sack of rice pilaf. Because I was full by the time salad was done, the rest was boxed up with an unrequested bag of those crack biscuits. Way to go the extra block mr. Server.   Truly, so much food, that I asked my date to ask for box, dessert, and bill within 3 bites of my main.   Dessert, I like brownie a la mode. But as another learning experience, I should ask what else it comes with, because too much caramel and chocolate drizzle on both brownie and ice cream takes away from the balance of sweetness, making it way too sweet to enjoy. Next time, I'd prefer a plain scoop of \"mode\", thanks.  Overall, this rating goes for the meal and service, and id like to come back and try their signature and fresh fish offerings."}
{"text":"Stay away, unless you want poor food, and you have a hour to kill prior to eating. Hour waiting time, disappearing waitress, some of the food was luke warm.  Instead of butter we got melted margarine, when we questioned it, we got butter.  Lobster was missing a claw, my Ultimate Feast was anything but ultimate, served with 2 table spoons of rice. We will never go to another Red Lobster again.  Couple next to us had basically the same problem, but they waited 1.5 hours.  Stay Away"}
{"text":"First off, 1 star is deducted because the host wasn't 'hosting' anything because he was too busy watching the NBA playoffs. I had to get his attention by expressing my feelings to my friend.   After we were initially seated, we were greeted by the waiter, James (if I recall correctly), and he was pleasant and a pretty good waiter for the most part. To get to the food part, I ordered the trio option for $15.99 which included almond crusted salmon, sweet chili lime shrimp, and lobster Mac -n- cheese. Everything was good for the most part, but the sketchy 'lobster' part of the dish was a bit fishy to sum up the taste. Not in a good 'fishy' way if that even exists.   I'm tired of typing on this phone but above is basically why they were granted 3 stars. I would 1/2 it, but they don't have that option for users."}
{"text":"Crab legs are always cold and stale.what's the deal? Lobster isn't good.longhorn and outback have better lobster than them..."}
{"text":"Debby is a sweet heart and her service is awesome. The food is great but I always just get the seafood stuffed sole, shrimp linguini Alfredo and shrimp scampi.. Creature of habit! The new hand crafted lemonades are amazing!"}
{"text":"Nothing special but bot bad just a regular red lobster. Good service good food. Clean restaurant. Nice staff. Lil hard to get into parking lot but no biggie."}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch yesterday since it's been over a year since I've been to Red Lobster. I don't eat seafood, but I love their cajun chicken alfredo and their cheddar biscuits! The food was excellent and my girlfriend did the create your own lunch where she was able to pick 2 seafood items and a side. Both our meals also came with side salads, which was a nice surprise. Their lunch entrees are pretty inexpensive for what you get, and both of our entrees were $10.79 each. We had an excellent server who was attentive so attentive that it became annoying and even brought us refills before we even started to run low. Will definitely have to stop by more often!"}
{"text":"The portions are massive. The New York strip is one of my favourites, and the Lobster and Steak surf and turf are one of my favourites. Only downside is that they slightly over cooked my steak when I asked for medium rare, ended up getting a medium well steak."}
{"text":"Worst food ever! Server was sweet - which was thee only good part of the meal. Cooks confused asparagus with green beans.. Lobster pizza tasted funny, the lobster on the pizza tastes fishy and chewy. Wine was old, clearly bottle has been open for a while. Lobster tail was blan and sloppy. The worst part hands down was the crab legs! Came out literally ice cold!! Server apologized and said it happened all the time?!?!!.. The manager magically brought out new crab legs about 2 min later. Clearly microwaved. No apologies or much talk from manager, just here you go. Granted at the end 25% was taken off. But we will never go back again. It was just awful."}
{"text":"This night at Red Lobster was the worst. We came here on a Saturday night. We had to wait but, not a problem at all. You expect that on a busy night. The place is under construction and that is not good to keep it open while that is going on. It actually smelled like chemicals and building materials. The worst part about this night was our waiter Bob. He had no interest in doing a good job that night or in making any money apparently. We had the worst possible service that you could imagine. Old and cold coffee, wrong drinks and ,he even put the wrong number on our order. So that when someone else brought out our food they could not find us.  The cheese biscuts are not what they used to be, All fake ingredients in my book. Not happy at all with our experiance here, I absolutly will say we will never be back."}
{"text":"Not my favorite seafood spot.  The restaurant is clean.  Our server Jo was super attentive and friendly!!  A+ for her!  We always had everything we needed, refills and fresh bread.  The bread is my favorite thing here but it was a bit too salty. I chose the potato soup, which I also found to be too salty. I'm not one to enjoy crab that has been previously frozen.  There was nothing bad about my snow crab other than that.  It was very much what you would expect from Red Lobster and it still hit my crab craving.  They are pretty consistent...everything I remember from when I came here as a kid."}
{"text":"I was gifted a 25 dollar gift card to red lobster so last night me and my boyfriend decided to try it out I personally have never been here usually I'd never eat here but since I had the gift card I decided to give it a shot everything was fine we ate food was decent when it came down to pay we clearly put the gift card in there and my boyfriends debit card the waiter took the check and I remember feeling weird I saw him look in it as he walked away as well well we signed the check and when we signed we were under the impression that what we signed for had included the gift card my mistake obviously because this morning I check my bfs bank account and the full bill was charged his account went overdrawn because of it and I was confused I thought maybe it hadn't been fully processed yet so I call red lobster to see what happened to the gift card and make sure it goes in and he said that's weird bc he sees no gift card has no idea what I'm talking about he ask me if I have a receipt for the gift card but I obviously don't I didn't think to keep it and now my gift card doesn't exist so he said he'll have to investigate now I'm just waiting for him to get back to me hopefully he will or I'll be contacting corporate"}
{"text":"I'll give this latest visit 3 stars because it was good food just had lots of issues with service.  The server was very lax and inattentive so we had to resort to asking for a floor manager .... soup was not hot ..   normally it wouldn't be so bad but clam chowder semi warm just wasn't good.  The food was good  ( which is why I would give the review 3 stars) after asking for several different items the waitress still failed . Water refills and hand wipes after crab legs should not have been so hard to get."}
{"text":"Getting a table can be very difficult for big groups! We went to make a reservation for a table of nine but were told they don't take reservations; however they do \"call aheads\". So we did that and were told we wouldn't have to wait very long when we got there. We arrived at 5:20pm and were not seated until close to 6pm. We were told it was because of the large rush of people who came in just before us but it could have been easily prevented by reserving a table for us. Besides that, the biscuits are delicious and the main course was pretty good. I had the garlic grilled shrimp over rice with mashed potatoes. I found the rice to be somewhat bland but the shrimp was fantastic.  I don't think I would choose to return of my free will as there are many other places with seafood that can offer tastier food and faster service."}
{"text":"One Word: Disappointment.  It has been a while since I have been to Red Lobster. This was not my first time to this location, but perhaps over a year since i have dined at Red Lobster. I just remember the amazing cheddar bay biscuits they bring freshly baked to the table. It was the best part of the meal here, always. I could eat the whole basket right when they bring it out and sometimes I do and then get too full to eat an entree.  The reason we chose Red Lobster for our early dinner was because there was an ad in the mail for $29.99 for 2 people to dine - 2 salads, 2 entrees, and choice of appetizer or desssert. As great as it sounded, I knew there would be a catch but we went anyways as I had been craving the biscuits. After waiting about 10 minutes to be seated, when it wasn't even busy... I was so disappointed with the deal. I knew the entees would be limited, but so were the desserts and appetizers, to only 3 choices of each. We also had a coupon with the ad that is $4 off two dinners, and the server said we could've used it with the $29.99 offer.  But I really just wanted the biscuits and lobster nachos. So that's what we ended up doing, lobster nachos and shrimp scampi to share. Pictures will be posted. The first 3 bites of each item was great! But that was about it. Then the nachos were soggy and there wasn't much lobster, and then the scampi was filled with small shrimps, but after about 3 bites I felt sick.  The server was very nice though. But I completely agree with the current rating of this restaurant, about 2.5 stars. Not worth the price for what you get. There's so many better quality or better value restaurants.  I'll just have to learn to make the cheddar biscuits myself! Which, BTW, were not as good this time as I remembered..."}
{"text":"If you think customer service is dead. Come try Red Lobster out. We drive past three other locations to get here. Always as pleasure and good service with a smile. Food is not skimpy you will leave full, and happy."}
{"text":"Nasty, salty and buttery food. If you feel like getting a kidney stone, come here. I had the lobster pizza, was goods but there was salt chunks on the bottom.. Why? I had a bite of the salmon, yuck salt. The biscuits have always been good, but wow too much salt! The coconut shrimp was okay, the tartar sauce that came with it was gross and warm. The sauce had oil sitting at the top of it. I won't ever come back if they continue using salt on food that already has salt!"}
{"text":"This place has really gone down hill over the years. We arrived (4 people) at 11:25 on New Years Day. The place was pretty much empty. It still took the hostess about 10 minutes to seat us, which I know isn't long, but when there isn't anyone in the place, we felt like we should have been seated right away. The food was average at best. Our server was friendly but not very well trained. Not her fault."}
{"text":"So both my boyfriend and I got the admirals fiest and when we were eating the food tasted like it was expired. both dishes were 20 dollars so we wasted 40 dollars. We also got the stuffed mushroom appetizer which is basically a hot mushroom swimming in garlic and butter with their \"secret\" stuffing that's equivalent to the small shrimps in the ramen soups with bread crumbs. Don't come here or you'll get food poisoning or an upset stomach. Not coming back and very upset.     Update: so we went yesterday and took home all the leftovers and i just had some a while ago now I feel like I need to go to the doctors. Definitely not going back!"}
{"text":"Red lobster will never get old to me I always enjoy myself when I eat there. Those biscuits will always be my favorite. The most recent time I ate there I got the loaded potato soup and the chicken Alfredo. Taste sensation!"}
{"text":"Red lobster was not the place to be tonight. Saturday-8/11!!!! The service was horrible. The waiter messed up so bad that we had more free food then we ordered. The appetizer came out after the salad. It seem to be over before it started. It only went down hill from here. I am done with this location. Come on red lobster!!!"}
{"text":"The last time I ate at Red Lobster was at least 6 years ago, but this year I was convinced by my friends to come here for Endless Shrimp. I can't believe I've never heard about this event before.   For $22.99 (before taxes), you get to basically do all you can eat from 4-5 shrimp dishes. You pick 2 dishes to start and then you can order more of any of the options (one order at a time). The first 2 dishes, though, come with 2 sides, so be careful and don't order all the carbs. Our waiter was quite nice and started ordering additional skewers for us without us even asking.   I wouldn't say it's anywhere close to being \"amazing seafood\", but if you like shrimp, it's a pretty good bang for your buck! To be honest, I think that by the 4th or 5th dish, I was so sick of shrimp I just wanted to go grab some ice cream from across the street.   Those Red Lobster biscuits though? Still just a good as they've always been!"}
{"text":"As a student renting downtown, Red Lobster has always been out of my budget.  However, it had caught my attention not too long ago that they offer $8.99 lunch specials Monday - Friday from 11am-3pm. So for post-exam celebrations, this place has now risen to one of my go-to's (my friends and I are getting tired of always going to Pickle Barrel)! The dish that I almost always order is the shrimp tacos which come with three generously loaded tacos + a side of seasoned rice. Not to mention, this IS Red Lobster after all and you can get unlimited signature biscuits for free! The biscuits may be a little on the salty side but they're buttery, smell great, and are served immediately after seated which is great for satiating any initial starvation. The atmosphere is great, the servers are always cheerful and polite, and the location is indoor/close to the downtown core.   The only thing I would advise against is the shrimp nachos. My friends and I split for it and although yes, there were many shrimps, the shrimps were tiny and didn't give that fulfilling crunchy mouthfeel that you get from larger shrimps (like the ones they put in the tacos). Also, the nacho chips that they used were not that tasty. Quite bland and not crunchy enough. Worst of all was the cheesy. They used the melted processed cheese that you get when you order nachos in the movie theaters. Yuck! At a place like the Red Lobster where almost all of their seafood is doused in melted high quality cheese, you would think they'd use it on their nachos too!  Anyway, knowing not to order the nachos again, I would definitely come here again no problem!"}
{"text":"Why can I not stay away from this place? Oh ya, I had another gift card. :) Went with the beau on Monday night after going allllll the way south to hit Ikea. Oh, I should also review Ikea. OK, so went in, were seated right away and noted that service was going to be pretty good this night. I forget her name but she was on the ball. Ordered popcorn shrimp meal, a great value for $13 and the beau got stuffed sole, not bad for $14. We even had waters to stretch the gift card out. Baked potatoes came with both meals upon our request (sick of rice), they were very good and did not taste like they had been sitting under a heating lamp for hours OR leftover from the lunch service. Here were the pitfalls on this night. 1- Caesar salad - just plain and not good. Barely better than the garden salad. The clam chowder is very good here but it costs an extra $3.25 with your meal should you choose it. Highway robbery if you ask me. It is a very small cup too. The prices here seem to keep going up as the portions are go down. 2- They were out of everything. My husband likes the tilapia and as he was about to order THAT, the server mentioned the restaurant was out. Not only out of that but the nachos (who gets that at Red Lobster? Kids?) And the pizza, they were out of that too. Word to the wise, most chefs know that seafood just does not go with cheese. Maybe kids like that too. We were also informed that they were out of all drink mixes, margarita, pina colada mix etc. 3 - Ya, we were there late around 9pm but it does not give the place the right to vacuum around our feet! The service saved the night and what we did get to eat was very good. As usual, we took as many buns as we could and had lunch for the next day with our remaining leftovers.  I had a $5 off coupon so on the gift card our entire meal from savvy ordering was $22 for 2 people!!!! I love the Ultimate Feast but man, it costs $30 just for that plate not including drinks.  TIP - the fresh fish comes in on Tuesdays and Thursdays to have enough on hand for the weekend so Fridays would be a good day to come in if you love fish. This location is RIGHT across from Chinook Shopping Centre though so be prepared to wait a bit for a table on weekends."}
{"text":"It seems once again we are invisible, happened to us before here! Our server very slow to come to our table, then when she did, took forever to return with drinks! She said be right back and of course we waited and waited! Finally came to take our order, okay where is the salad and biscuits! Newcomers got there's , we are still waiting! Finally got salad and bread ! Others came in after us  had entrees, we waited and waited! Finally came food, she never showed up again, flagged her down for take out box, one minute turned into 15! Seems like we spent the whole afternoon on this server! Could not believe what time it was when we left! I'd say they must have been  really busy but they weren't! The only saving grace was the food was good except for my fried clams, they looked like the bottom of the box was emptied in the fryer,  itty bitty pieces with 2 or 3 clams! Might just be this server but it happened to us before! I mean totally forgotten that time, I don't think they even put our order in! We usually go to Goodyear, no problems there, but decided to shop in Surprise!"}
{"text":"It was ok. Several of their items were not available on this day for some unforeseen reason.  I was not impressed with the amount of crab legs they offered compared to the litany of cheap Chinese buffets offering crab legs of equal quality in unlimited quantities.   The place itself was very nice and clean. This was a Saturday afternoon and it was about half full."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever!  Went to enjoy a birthday lunch only to recieve a bowl of grease and oil not once but twice! If I could give no stars I would!!!"}
{"text":"Slow drink service and a major menu change makes me think twice about a return visit here. Not happy with the price increase either."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what changed but something has happened with the shrimp. I have never been, nor am I now, allergic to shtimp. If I eat shrimp literally anywhere else I have no issues.  The last 2 times I visited Red Lobster, this location and the one near PV mall, I have had an allergic reaction. I mean I'm itching and breaking out in hives allergic. I played it off the 1st time as a fluke since I have been to RL dozens of times but after 2nd time in a row it was settled. I'm not 100% sure it's the shrimp or the biscuits or what but it's no good."}
{"text":"Typical \"seafood\" from Red Lobster. Tastes like frozen dinner but this is where my Dad wanted to go. I had the endless shrimp which was ok. I usually love the cheddar bay biscuits but this time they weren't cooked all the way. They were actually gooey in the center!!  Ewwww. However, the soup was good...and that's why I upgraded it to 3 stars instead of 2."}
{"text":"I ordered tilapia. They presented very nice on the mashed potatoes. When I just tasted the tilapia it was bland. They asked me about it and gave it to me for free. I will be back."}
{"text":"It has been years since going to a Red Lobster. My wife got a gift card so we went. The new wood grilled lobster, prawn, salmon plate looked awesome so we gave that a try. It was just the right size for us to share. That with the salad and the complimentary bread had us satisfied and not over stuffed.  Good quality food that tasted very good. I would have given 5 stars but the whole experience was just lacking something. I had a great time and liked the food, but not sure when I will be back."}
{"text":"Prices keep going up and up while the portions get smaller including the salad which is about the size of a saucer dish. The lobster tail came out soggy but the salmon & scallops were good. As were the red potatoes for the side."}
{"text":"1st time at this location. We came for lunch and it was delicious! Place was clean, staff was nice and our server was attentive. Place was packed because of lunch but our food didn't take long. We'll be back 4 sure!"}
{"text":"Service was horrible, my family and I waited 15 minutes before being greeted by our waitress and the place was nearly empty. It then took an additional 15 minutes to get our waters, WHEN she brought out our salads at the same time. Half the time we couldn't find her when needed something and she left us sitting for a long time when we wanted to leave. Food was mediocre as well. I don't know what happened to red lobster, but its absolutely terrible now. Won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Place is a little expensive compared to the refined\"dollar menu\" palate I usually have, but their seafood is great, the free biscuits are great, and the servers are professional and nice.  Last visit was Father's Day 2015 for me and despite it being very busy, our server was checking in every few minutes to make sure we didn't need anything, the food was brought quickly, and the manager stopped by just to make sure we having a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"We went there last night for dinner and had Lindsey as our server. She was amazing from the beginning to end, very friendly. The kitchen staff also sent out an extra lobster tail since they thought the one they gave me was too small. Definitely coming back"}
{"text":"My first time at a Red Lobster, and I was super excited!  Too bad it was substandard :( They were out of ALL fresh fish, including salmon. Which narrows down the menu to shrimp and lobster, with lots of creamy,heavy sauces. I love alfredo sauce but the one on my shrimp and scallop linguine was bland, with tiny pieces of shrimp and scallops scattered throughout.   My bf and I got the four course meal, which comes with soup, salad, entree and dessert. Reasonable deal. His mother and grandmother got the seafood trio, which didn't have too many options due to the fish shortage but they said it tasted alright.   Our waiter Jesus was very attentive and I have nothing but positive things to say about him. Drinks were always filled and we didn't have to wait for anything once we were seated.  However, the food was just WAY too average for the high price tag, and I can't justify giving any more than two stars on this occasion."}
{"text":"We went there for their endless shrimp and this was our first time. The service is 5/5 - our server tried her best to take care of us. Every time she noticed that we were about to finish our shrimp, she asked if we want more. But the food was below expectation. We tried all five shrimps and they were either too salty or too sweet. We tipped a lot for the service provided, but I don't think we will ever come back next year for their endless shrimp."}
{"text":"First timers here at this location - and last timers... it was pretty bad. When we pulled up, the exterior appeared to be going through some pretty major renos but it was business as usual. The restaurant was open and the parking lot was busy. We decided to give it a shot and went inside.  The lobster tank at the front that always welcomes you at a Red Lobster was empty but running. My husband asked the gal where the lobsters were and she replied that they were out! Really??? No lobsters at Red Lobster. Off to our seat we went over the most filthy floors ever. We stepped over crayons, a dirtyt butter knife, a slew of little garbage pieces/food everywhere. Yes, we should have walked out but I was so craving my piece of fish!  Soup - clam chowder - forget hot, it was not even warm  Salad with dressing on side - dressing had been in a container on top of my salad and had spilled everywhere onto my salad en route to our table - inedible, turned into raspberry vinaigrette soup The fish entree - tilapia - presumed frozen and just bland and tasteless with soggy broccoli  The service was less then impressive - on robot mode and everyone knows robots do not smile. 1 star for the dessert - even though we got the wrong one brought to our table (we had ordered the key lime). We got a warm brownie with vanilla ice cream. THAT was pretty perfect. I think they were doing renos inside the restaurant but it was hard to tell as the place really was a mess, even the washrooms - avoid if you can!  For about the same price, we could have gone to the Keg."}
{"text":"The service here is excellent! And the prices are very reasonable (well, depending on what you get). But honestly, the food is just not that great. The lobster is just kinda weird and the things that are good, it's usually bc they are so crazily unhealthy."}
{"text":"Sat in the bar. Service was decent. Took longer than usual to get our food. Had to kill 2 flies, no joke, while trying to enjoy lunch. Ere the only ones in the bar and he food still took noticeably long"}
{"text":"It was my Girlfriend's Birthday, and I had just taken her for a pedi and was ready for lunch.  She had never been to a Red Lobster, and I thought it might be a good change and great Happy Birthday Lunch!  This place was AWESOME!  Our server was Cierra (I believe, a young lady), and she was fabulous.  The customer service was \"On POINT!\".  The seafood dishes were amazing!  In fact, my Girlfriend had just come back from San Francisco and had lobster there along the coastal area.  She said this lobster was better than the one she had there!  The place wasn't to crowded and very clean!  They really made my Girlfriend's Birthday lunch a special one!  Thank you guys!"}
{"text":"The 1 star is only left because there is no option for minus stars, with that said...... I dragged my husband here kicking and screaming trying to convince him they had good food since all my experiences in NY locations were amazing. We sat down and ordered and it took 20 minutes just to get our drinks....which were very good . Then it took us another 20 to get someone to take our order.   Now I have to tell you there was more than enough staff and only a total of 6 patrons, 3 couples in this entire restaurant.  What we ordered: coconut shrimp, stuffed mushrooms, parmasean crusted tilapia, with baked potato and sides of lobster tails  What we got: the shrimp was edible, mushrooms which were whole uncooked with cheese and breadcrumbs haphazardly thrown on top, tilapia which had bread crumbs and a tiny bit of shaved parmasean on top, baked potatoes which were raw and broccoli that was raw. And the lobster tails had barely any lobster, were so rubbery and over cooked it all must have shrunk to what looked like a wishbone.  It took almost an hour to bring this to us.  What the manager said was \" oh we were out of a lot of stuff, the truck just came in now\"  so let me ask you, as the manager did you not think to tell your  staff to notify the patrons of this, and have them suggest something that your cooks weren't going to I love Lucy through cooking?  The manager ended up not charging us for any of the food as he agreed it was in edible, but I had my husband saying told you so and apologizing to me because he felt bad that we wasted a night going to this place.    We will never ever go back to red lobster in NC for fear they are not close enough to a coast to have fresh fish and I think that May have been a factor as well."}
{"text":"A combo is all you need I ordered one of those combo plates that included lobster, pasta, fried shrimps, rice, and grilled shrimps  Taste? The food are a bit salty to me and my mother. But not to my father. I especially love the pasta. Adding lemon on it gives a taste of savory and sour at the same time, such a great combination.   Price? This restaurant is a more upscale restaurant so we ended up paying over $100 for 3 meals + $20 tips. I would say unless you can afford eating, don't stop by for quick lunch. I think even 6 lobster balls costs $9.99 when you can get them for $6 elsewhere  Service? The greeter seemed like he was asleep but our waiter was nice and polite, thus the tips."}
{"text":"Ask for Emmett he is really one of the best waiters I ever had and honnnnnayyyyy I eat like two fat chicks during a divorce ....."}
{"text":"Its been a long time since i was at a Red Lobster restaurant, but i dont think i will wait this long again to visit next time.  Let me start by saying the service was attentive and very good.  I had the grilled chicken and shrimp with rice and a baked potato.  I was very impressed.  The shrimp were nicely cooked while the chicken was very tender.  The rice had lots of flavor and was very pleasing to the pallet.  The baked potato was a bit small in my opinion but still very good, and loaded with butter.  The other entrees  at our table were the fishermans feast which had a nice assorment of various seafood items, the lobster linguini, and their peppercorn steak.  Everyone was pleased with their meal, although i didnt have the opportunity to reach across the table and sample them, i think thats frowned upon by some people ;)"}
{"text":"Kim was GREAT! REALLY enjoyed her service....  K.I.M. keep it moving is her motto. My fiance says we will be back, and make this or date place. The food was delicious, came out fast and hot!   We will be back"}
{"text":"Had dinner here on 1/8.Ordered 4 appetizers.Lobster pizza,Artichoke dip w/nachos,shrimp lettuce  wraps and cocunut shrimp.Food was very good,our server Mikel was awesome.Checked on us a few times,refilled our drinks.Could not ask for better service.When we first walked in the seating process was confusing,they have several people seating guests and they all tell you something different.Looked like one guy was new or being trained as a host.We ended up being seated within a few minutes and it was just a minor negative."}
{"text":"Brown Lobsters displayed in a tank as soon as you enter. As a person who has traveled the Maritimes quite a lot. I think these are all cheap lobsters weighing around 1 to 1.5 lbs. However you do get to 'meet and greet' your future meal - which is kinda thoughtful.  I believe the restaurant got the name \"Red Lobster\" as that is the color of the lobster's shell once boiled and completely cooked. But they definitely Orange or Brown when they are alive tho.  They usually offer free biscuits. They are very yummy when they are fresh and warm but lose all taste when cold. Like Kanye would say:  \"Sorry Red Lobster. I will let you finish but Popeye's has the best biscuits ever\"  I go once a year tho- endless shrimp with less and less options annually but those garlic shrimp be some crack- and I seem to need a fix as soon as summer is done."}
{"text":"Went back wth my wife last night.  We were seated immediately.   Took quite some time to get our drinks.  Took forever to get our food when it was ordered.  There was a larger party that came in 20 mins after us. They got all of their food before us, and left well before us.  When I was finally able to find our waitress to ask about our food she said she would check.  10 mins later she came back to tell us it should be 3-5 mins more.  Almost 10 mins later she brought our food.  The skin that was forming on the outside of the food indicated it had been sitting at the pass for a little bit.    Going to RL I do not expect the elegant fine dinning experience, but do expect customer service.  Maybe they were short staffed?  The smug looking manager never checked to see how we were doing as he just walked around.  We got offered 1 refill in our 1.5 hours in this place.  The food  was ok.  The service was not good.  However, the waitress was cool when she was able to stop running like crazy for a minute.    Customer service seems to be an art that is being lost on the younger generation as they grow older."}
{"text":"This used to be my Go-To restaurant as a kid for seafood, but now.. Every time I go I'm always disappointed.  I've been to this location a couple times, not by choice but because others wanted Red Lobster.  The biscuits are probably the only thing I love and the only addicting thing on the menu.  A group of girls and I came here as a get together.  We all order different dishes, I decided to go with their Crab and Roasted-Garlic Seafood Bake from their Crabfest menu.  This dish included steamed Canadian snow crab legs paired with tender shrimp and bay scallops roasted in a garlic and white wine broth, served with sweet corn on the cob and red potatoes. It was decent except the whole dish was drenched in garlic butter which made everything really, really salty.  I ended up taking out all my potatoes, corn, shrimp and scallops out of the bake dish because it was soaking in butter.  One of my co-workers ordered the Admiral's Feast from the Crabfest menu as well.  Her dish included lightly breaded shrimp, bay scallops, clam strips and fish fried to a golden brown.  I got a taste of her scallops and they tasted like fried batter and nothing more (bland).  She also ended up getting a rotten baked potato, a lemon wedge that looked like it had been used and her piece of fried fish was broken into two pieces and they decided to cover it with two lemon wedges to act as if there was nothing wrong with the fish being broken into two pieces.  The waitress was nice enough to bring her a whole new dish which was better the second time around.  The overall presentation of the food was more appetizing, but the food and portion sizes used to be much better than it is now.  All I can say is SALT GALORE!  Although, the service we got was amazing, I rather pay more for better quality seafood and maybe next time I'll just stick to the clam chowder and biscuits.  I'm sorry Red Lobster but you raise a lot of Red Flags!"}
{"text":"Notable for the coronary-inducing cheese biscuits and the sheer variety of seafood you can order soaked in your choice of butterfat.  Far be it from me to say anything against butter and cream, but here it feels a bit... mechanical?  It's an easy place to take kids, and it's a relatively inexpensive place to indulge your shrimplust.  Good comfort food!"}
{"text":"What's the big deal about this place?  No matter what I order I'm always disappointed, and the prices are outrageous.    Really,  there are better seafood places around.  The Japanese stakehouse right down the road (other side of the 60) has great mahi and salmon!  The casinos all have crab leg and shrimp buffets!  Why waste good money on bad food?"}
{"text":"I went in here with my girlfriend and her daughter to get the all you can eat shrimp.  Things started off slow...sat there for 10 minutes before being greeted.  Finally, our server, Annie E. came over and said she would be with us in just a minute.  Ok...not a problem.  Then another server came over just to take our drink order.  We gave it to her and asked if she could take our food order as well?  When that happened, Annie came over right away and took our order.  Annie seemed nice from the beginning.    We ordered the shrimp and she asked if we wanted to put in 2 refills right now, since they take about 15 minutes to come out, and this would expedite things.  Score!  I was loving this already.    Then everything went downhill.  The food took almost 30 minutes to come out.  At least the refills were coming soon...or at least I thought.  She didn't deliver the food, and didn't stop back for almost 10 minutes.  My water was empty for quite a while.  She asked if we were ready for the refills.  Of course we were, our food was gone.  We waited another 20 minutes for the refills that take 15 minutes to come out, that were supposed to be quicker since she took them ahead of time, but that didn't happen.  We ate those, and waited...and waited...and waited.  She then came over and asked if we wanted more refills?  No thanks  I honestly didn't want to wait another 20 minutes.  The one meal came with a dessert, and I just asked if we could get that...and she started walking away.  I asked, as she was walking away, if I could get some more water, since they were empty, again and also a box as she was about 15 feet away.  She could not even wait until I finished my sentence before walking away.  I was never rude, I was just asking.  She brought the items out and then tried to be nice again by asking if we wanted biscuits to go or more shrimp to go.  Again, I said, \"No, thanks.\"  As we just wanted to go.  I would skip this place."}
{"text":"The last two times I have been to this RL the food has been really bad. The wait staff are ok. They try to be friendly. This used to be one of the better RL. Really disappointed now."}
{"text":"We stopped in for a light lunch and was pleasantly surprised to get a seat quickly despite the place being packed. The service was attentive and quick. I never had to notice that my glass was empty. The biscuits were tasty as always and the food was delicious (a variety of shrimp, stuffed mushrooms, and salads)"}
{"text":"This place is ridiculous. It's a shame that is is the only location that is somewhat near us, to go to. The last couple of times that we've went here, the wait time was absolutely ridiculous. And the service wasn't much better. We called in earlier that day to put our name down since we had a party of 6 coming in and we still had to wait over an hour to be seated. We tried asking a few times how long our wait was going to be and the hosts just ignored us. If you can avoid it, don't come to this location, especially on the weekend. After having to wait over an hour just to get seated, we weren't greeted with the best service. We had to ask multiple times for things, some to the point where we started asking other servers since ours wasn't coming around. I know it was busy and all, but you should at least check on all your tables instead of letting us sit for who knows how long without any drinks, biscuits, napkins, anything that we were needing. The food was ok, but for the service alone, I don't know if I'd want to come back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Had a excellent anniversary dinner here! Steak and shrimp were just perfect ! The service wasn't bad at all. The atmosphere in there was awesome. Everyone seemed to be in a good mood which made our night and anniversary even better. I will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying that I would have given this place 3 stars, but for one thing.  I think we all agree that when one tips at a restaurant, the tip, whatever its magnitude, should be against the amount of food and drink BEFORE tax, not including tax.  When I received the bill for our dinner last night the restaurant's printed bill was kind enough to state the dollar value of different percentages of tip, but it was calculated against the entire amount, including tax.  I think, the restaurant should change that.  I used to design point-of-sale systems, so I know this is not a big deal to accomplish.  Be sure that you all look at such bills everywhere you go and make sure you tip only against the subtotal BEFORE tax.    That having been said, the service was great, in every way.  No complaints at all.  The food - different story.  My wife ordered the special fresh trout and the fish was really good - well done and hot when delivered.  She also opted to pay $2.49 extra to upgrade her salad to a Caprese.  Wrong move.  The Caprese was just a small cup of raw chopped tomatoes with not enough mozzarella, olive oil or basil added.  Her wild rice was very dry and flavorless.  Could have used some spices and butter or sauce of some sort.  My wife also ordered cheesecake, which was acceptable.   My fish and chips may be the worst I have ever had, although the portion was appropriate.  But the fish was certainly frozen, dry and overcooked, no flavor at all.  My fries were also nothing to write home about, just average.  On the other hand their biscuits are wonderful!!!  Probably won't go back."}
{"text":"Good Ol' Red Lobster!!  Dropped by for lunch as I was kinda feeling nostalgic and wanted to rehash the past.  Growing up my family would come here for lunch after church on Sundays.   The food had remained the same. Nothing special, but it never disappoints.   As usual, I ordered the trio shrimp feast. Really filling! I shared with MR who got a \"build your lunch\" (portion looked really sad so I gave him some of my fried shrimp and garlic shrimp).  I really enjoyed having lunch here today.  Service was quick and courteous.  Of course, I will be returning as I have for the past 20 yrs."}
{"text":"I love the 2# lobster! Broccoli was a little aldente but the lobster & shrimp cocktail for $15 is a steal! Sarah W. was our server and she was great, and she had quite a few tables going!"}
{"text":"I just ate their endless shrimp yesterday w my BF and it was so great and filling! Definitely too heavy but they were so prompt w each plate. We never had to ask for a refill for our teas or our plates never piled up, the waiter was awesome too. As for the endless shrimp we had each type they offered and they were all extremely hot and tasty and it was almost overwhelming bc we were half way into our first plates when he brought out our second plates and it was just way too much but I'm happy to say I was surprised by the good and fast service."}
{"text":"I went by myself, I stood by the hostess stand waiting to be seated. A group of 3 approached her a moment later. The hosstess started to seat them. She then looked at me, and said  oh you were here 1st. I said yes I was. I asked to sit outside. I was alone on the patio. Happy to be in the peace.  My waiter came out shortly and took my order. He was helpful and checked on me as I ate my meal. The parmesaan shrimp was good, the crab macaroni was okay. The shells became dry. Biscuits spot on as always. Best part was the Huge Strawberry Daiquiri and being alone.."}
{"text":"Found a hair in my food that night.... Even though that really ruined my excitement about dinner, management comp'd the meal & totally fixed it. Good food but poor cleanliness apparently."}
{"text":"It is a nice place. This is not my first time. I keep coming back. I had the Salmon New Orleans. My favourite dish. It was nice juicy and well marinated. It is served with sides like mashed potato and Veg.."}
{"text":"Horrible service.  I have been to Red Lobster many times most times its a 3 hr long visit but dont go often anymore because the service and food is not up to par anymore.  Its not worth what they charge.  We went in and were seated immediately which i was blown away because when i came here last time it was empty and took us 20 min to get a seat.  We sat 20 min before the waitress took our drink order forgot the delicious little bread they serve while ur waiting but brought out the salads pretty promptly.  Our waitress wasnt the brightest and everytime we asked for something she did a rolling of the eyes number and seemed bothered honestly she shouldnt be working at red lobster with everything she had to be reminded of she is more mcdonalds material it may be management but no idea anyways when the food was brought out everything tasted just okay we were a party of 5 ( 3 children, 2 adults) and it was just mediocre food and bad service ended up spending 124 with the tip which if i was rude i really would have only gave 5 dollars because that is literally what the waitress should have gotten.  Overall spend your money elsewhere for the price and the service you mine as well spend a few extra dollars and go to papa deaux seafood."}
{"text":"I went with my parents on a Tuesday night around 8 pm and it was not very busy. We were seated right away and the hostess was very nice and made sure we got seated where we wanted. The server was very helpful and answered all questions we had very effectively. He was an awesome and  very polite guy with an outstanding personality. The food was very fresh and tasted very good. The great atmosphere of the restaurant made us have a wonderful time and we would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Wood grilled shrimp was good, Bloody Mary was great, but Aziya, the waitress, was excellent. She was concerned about making sure everything was just right. She made it look easy, but she's obviously a hard worker behind the scenes. Also made us laugh. Great experience!"}
{"text":"The Crab Fest is fun. Special drinks, you keep the glass, real glass, good size. We skipped appetizers, since the specials are good size, and came with good side orders. We ended up drinking the special cocktail, white & red wine, and IPA beers. The Crab order had various crabs as well as Dungenesse crab legs, which is my favorite. Then we sat outside, after sunset, for the coffee and chocolate desert. The weather was nice for this time of the year  The waitress was very nice and helpful. All in all, great and nice dinner experience. Will do it again. :-)"}
{"text":"Ask for Belinda!  She is the best. Great food and outstanding service. Great way to start the new year. NY Steak and mashed potatoes were fantastic. Shrimp is,delicious. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Marvin is the best; we've come here 4 years I'm a row from canada due to him. 10/10 would visit \"Just to see Marvin\". Ohhh.. Food was great too!!"}
{"text":"The worst service and food in all red lobster chains I have ever experienced. Took two guests there and I am embarrassed."}
{"text":"Came with my family and got seated. We waited for 15 minuets and still no server and no acknowledgment so my family and I got up and left."}
{"text":"We went for our anniversary. We went around 5:30. The area we were seated in was not crowded at all and  quiet. The waitress greeted with a sincere smile each time she came to our table. We ordered the soup, salad, entree, and dessert at $17.99 each person, Monday through Thursday. All the food was hot and fresh. We asked if she could take a picture of us and she did. During the time there, another server offered us more water. We had a good anniversary dinner. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Awwful Experience drinks watered down, food. Been here since 6:15 stil at the table sent my food back I wascso frustrated. Will not come to this location again!!!"}
{"text":"This is the worst seafood restaurant I've ever gone to. They messed up crab legs and lobster legs! For gods sake your called red lobster make good crab legs. They were the saltiest crab legs I have ever eaten in my entire life! It was like if they socked them in 10 pounds of salt and then boiled it in salt water!? Like I couldn't eat them without wanted to drinking an entire lake or jagging. When I complained they brought us these huge crab or lobster legs some kinda rare and expensive thing for free and they were even just as salty... Never again red lobster. Never again"}
{"text":"Typically I love this place. Went with my family today and I was HIGHLY disappointed with the service. For a Saturday lunch that wasn't a busy time yet it took us entirely too long to get our food. I had to ask if we could get biscuits (sat for 15 mins, plates came, 25 mins later biscuits and food came). I had to crack my crab legs myself because my waitress didn't bring my crackers or a plate for the shells. I also asked for lemon and that took another 10 mins to come, when it finally did, she just set it on the table from around the corner not checking if that was all we needed or offered us refills. Terrible customer service!! We will not be returning to this location, I wouldn't recommend anyone to go either!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, and very short wait time to be seated and to receive my meal. However, I was stricken with a violent case of food poisoning after dining here. Beware."}
{"text":"I would give this place 5 stars and is the best because they didn't have mayo for my sister"}
{"text":"I'm going to start off by apologizing to the waiter & waitress that attended out table (of 14 people) because they don't deserve a 2-star rating, they were 4-5 stars... and I also apologize because I forgot their names, and would have liked to give them a shout-out.  We called 24+ hours in advance for a Thursday night reservation for 17 people (a few ended up dropping out last-minute). Reservation for 6:30 p.m. was confirmed upon arriving at the front desk. They tell us there is going to be a 35-40 minute wait...WHAT!?!?! That's why you make a reservation... so that everything is ready when you ARRIVE. Any schmo can come in and be seated in 35-40 minutes, especially on a slow(ish) night. The 2 girls at the front desk were clueless to why I was upset (and luckily for them, I kept my cool). I asked one of them, \"Red Lobster is a customer-service based business, right?\". Her response, \"I guess?\" - yes, answered with the tone of a \"question\". I suppose she didn't know that Red Lobster earns it's money from the patrons who attend, and especially for the returning customers coming back on a regular basis. I asked to speak with a manager, so one of the girls went to the back, then came back without the manager, and told our group that we would be seated within 5 minutes. I think I ended up seeing the manager later on that night (wearing pink... yeah, I saw you), but she avoided our table like the plague. I don't think she wanted to give our high roller table any consessions... you know... since I was soooooo rude. - Luckily your wait-staff saved the situation that you couldn't handle. Actually... about the high-roller comment... hahaha... We spent a good chunk of money because we weren't cutting corners for our friend's birthday dinner. We all pitched in to pay for their family's dinner, and nobody else skimped either. We probably spent near $450, not including tips or taxes.  Unfortunately for Red Lobster, we've been desperately searching for a different local seafood venue.  FORTUNATELY for us, we've found a couple. \"Hot & Juicy\" at Westgate, is a cajun seafood joint. It doesn't have a large variety on their menu, but their crab legs are pretty dang good, and the cajun butter sauce is really good, especially to dip your other food in. It's quite a messy experience, but great if you're in the mood for crab-legs or crawdad.  Another location popping up that we can't wait to try is Angry Crab Shack, going to be south of the I-10 on Litchfield Rd. Their other locations have great reviews, but we have yet to experience dining here.  Hopefully, those places will understand/realize that customers, and the service & food they provide are what keep the customers coming back."}
{"text":"Red Lobster , slowly I turn , step by step never to return. This location is the poster child for what is wrong with this chain. Lousy food , high prices poor service. Bring your magnifying glasses like their commercials. If you want the smallest sea food and portions you've come to the right place. If you want grease and oil saturated dishes then you'll love this restaurant. If you'll love overinflated checks then hallelujah this is heaven. How this chain remains in business is a miracle. If you want better seafood at half the price go to the Hong Kong Buffet from this location. You will never bother to return! Unless you miss grease an oil."}

{"text":"I've sat on writing this review for about a week now trying to decide what I wanted to say and how I wanted to rate this....well that and I was busy, ok?   Anyway, took some family members and a couple of kids to the Lobster on a Monday evening. With the SnowBirds stil in town, this place was busy. What was supposed to only be a 25 minute wait was actually a 45 minute wait and after telling them we were leaving, a table suddenly came available. Imagine that....  Our server was....confident. His introduction to us included a detailing of his excellence in service and went on for a couple of minutes while the kids squirmed. We ordered our drinks and away we went.   Now Mr. Excellence in Service wasn't so excellent. Maybe it was because he was the only server in our section and he had 7 tables with at least 4 people at each table. I imagine that was because he had bragged to the manager how awesome he was and that he could handle it because normally at chains, the managment has policies about the number of tables a server can have. But I digress. Our drinks would be empty for a while before he would get around to us. And to top it off, he forgot to order our appetizer that he himself said he LOVED and was his favorite. Our salads took FOREVER to arrive and when our meals came, one of my companions and I who had ordered the same item didn't get the right item. Very disappointing. When Mr. Excellence in Service was called over and we told him about the missing appetizer as well as the two dishes that were incorrect, he almost broke down in tears right at the table! WTF?   Anyway, we explained to him that we would eat our dinners but wanted a discount and wanted to be sure the app was not on our bill. He seemed fine with that and apologized about 200 times. Then the manager comes over. Clearly this woman has been beaten down by customers one too many times because she was nearly in tears as well. We weren't even mad...we just wanted to be sure we were billed correctly. She offered to put the missing item in a to-go box for us to enjoy later....again WTF? But she did give us free dessert, comp'd us a dinner and made sure the appetizer wasn't on our bill...which is all we wanted.   The food itself was fine...typical Red Lobster fare. Nothing overly special. The kids were happy with their food. I just wanted to be sure we didn't get billed for stuff we didn't get. But Mr. Excellence was so broken up about screwing up our table after all his bravado, he hardly returned until he brought us the bill where he apologized again so profusely even my 8 year old was like Dude, get a hold of yourself.   The saving grace of this experience was the comp'd dinner and free desserts. Yes I'll likely go back to Red Lobster because dammit I like that shrimp and lobster pasta. It beckons me every so often and I can't shake it.   If you go to this Red Lobster, expect a wait and expect substandard service, but at least you know the shrimp and lobster pasta won't disappoint you."}
{"text":"Went to have lunch here this week.  I normally don't go to Red Lobster since I don't especially like their menu, but a friend wanted to have lunch here so I agreed.  I had the shrimp fettuccine and it was OK but the sauce was too thick and by the time I got towards the end of the meal, it congealed into a big gooey lump of sauce and noodles.  The Caesar salad was so-so at best and the cheese biscuits are not as good as they used to be.  All in all, it was OK but nothing that would draw me back again on my own accord.  The only thing I did not like was that the server kept bugging us and checking on us.  I don't believe that he was being attentive, but rather, he wanted us to eat fast and leave so he could have another table ready for more customers and more tips.  So we left before we wanted to, and went across the street to McDonalds to have an ice tea and continue our discussion."}
{"text":"Too bad 2.5 stars isn't available.  Being from New England, I take seafood very seriously.  Given a $50 gift certificate, my wife & I gave it a shot.  The food was okay, but pricey for what you actually got.   Like so many other restaurants, its too bad you can't eat the photos shown on the menu.  Our waitress was excellent and very attentive.  The next time I want seafood, I'll wait until I get back to Maine."}
{"text":"Food is consistently good. Always live my seafood. Server is fine and sometimes he does a forget a few things but we have a pretty good sized group for one server. Overall he is very friendly and does try hard."}
{"text":"I leave work at the Meadows Mall craving a Seafood salad. Who better to call for pick-up than RL? But I am told on the phone that all they have is a Caesar with chicken, salmon or shrimp. Weird that a seafood restaurant doesn't know what a Shrimp Louie is but ok. I order the Caesar salad topped with fire-grilled shrimp, it will be ready in 15 minutes. So I dilly-dally to pass the time, then drive around the corner to pick it up \"at the bar\". I enter the restaurant behind a couple and naturally wait my turn while the young hostess, barely looking up from what she's doing and without a smile or greeting of any kind, says to them \"your name.\" The man asks the hostess why she needs his name if there's no one else in the lobby and she says snootily \"because we have to get your name.\" I would've told her to pound sand but he was very nice and complied. Meanwhile, I tell her that I have a pick-up in the bar and she gestures to her right. Not hello, not can I help you, just a dismissive wave of the hand. I enter the bar and the bartender does tell me he'll be with me in a minute. Ok, I'll wait. He returns a few minutes later and I tell him I have a take-out order. I must be the only one because he asks me to clarify what kind of dressing I want on the Caesar salad because I had ordered a side of thousand Island. I explained that I want the Caesar salad dressing on the salad and I want a side of thousand Island. He disappears again and I wait. And wait. And wait. Seriously? They told me 15 minutes and now I have to wait another 15 minutes? He finally returns with my order but I'm perplexed because the salad is in a container, the dressings are all in containers and then there is another small box. When I inquire he tells me it is the shrimp! Huh? Separate? If I had ordered this in the restaurant would it have come separately? So weird. But I'm ready to get the hell out of there so I pay my $16.49 + tip, he packs it up and I exit. I have to pass the same snotty little hostess who is now sweeping the floor and doesn't say goodbye, have a nice evening or thank you as I leave. No surprise there. I get home 10 mins later, the picture shows what my dinner looked like. I felt like throwing it away but it was my dinner! Not only have I had better (and way cheaper!) salads from a fast food drive-through, but every skimpy piece of shrimp still had shell on it that I had to spit out. I really regret that I had such a horrible experience at this establishment because I am new to Las Vegas and I was a frequent patron at my hometown Red Lobster. Hope the powers that be actually read this post and do something about every appalling bit of it."}
{"text":"Talk about a terrible waste of money besides a lousy experience.we had a table of four mentor location.we sat in a booth in bar area Our server tried her best but nothing worked The people surrounding us were so loud and obnoxious like they were let out of a cage for the night to act like pigs monkeys loud and disgusting.we couldn't change seats as the restaurant was busy and we did move one time already.my wife had a pizza app the arrived so soggy .she nor any of us liked.i ordered whole lobster which was cold along with dish of butter.my wife has shrimp dinner and never had a all you can eat refill My friends meals were just as bad The good part we lived through the gang of idiots.like taking 70 bucks and tossing it"}
{"text":"Food was great. Nice staff and lovely service. I highly recommend this place if you like sea food"}
{"text":"Called this location 4xs within 5 mins at 602.943.1163, phone constantly rung with no answer.  Drove over to the location and asked the hostesses to verify the phone #, she read the same on off to me, stated they've been having phone issues.  Sat at the bar to place a to go order, sat another 5 mins before anyone acknowledge me, still no bar tender yet. Waitress walking by asked if I had been helped and took the order, she then advised James would getting this together, guess he's the bar tender.   Chain restaurants already don't have a great reputation for food or service and this helps with the theory.  Get it together red lobster, Beyoncè did not promote your brand for this foolery! *another customer walked in and stated she's been calling with no answer also"}
{"text":"Ugh. I came here with family, but not by choice. There's something about big chain restaurants like these that I feel like it's a waste of money, and better value going to a local place that serves actual quality food.   It was lunch on a Sunday, and I was surprised that even with our party of 12 people, we could not make a reservation. Instead we got there 20 mins earlier to ensure we had a table. Got a nice spot, in the quieter area in the back. Surprisingly the restaurant around kept getting fuller from 1pm onwards. When we left at 3:30pm it was full and there was a line up! Why are people's eating schedules so strange in north york?!   We had two servers at the table, but both didn't seem to do much. I found it weird that they asked us (after 20 mins) whether we wanted drinks or not, when I believe they should have just taken our order, no need to ask.  Our plates were never cleared properly or in time. After our meal, and when dessert came, our plates from the main were still on the table. They were never around either, I don't know what was the point. Not to mention, our soups and salads all came at different times.   The menu at Red Lobster is huge and confusing. There are 3 different menus, regular lobsterfest and specials. There is also a lunch special for $8.99 plaque somewhere as well, not mentioned anywhere else. You can get a variety of things like fish, pasta, crab and lobster. But hard to find is anything not covered in butter or cheese. The hubby and I shared the Fire Grilled Lobster, Shrimp and Scallop ($28.99) that comes with a side or salad. Somehow we got them to add a cup of soup for $2.99 as well.  For something like this, the portion seemed huge in the photo, but actually was quite small. But easy to fill yourself up with the never ending buttery biscuits. Other family members got some of the other $20+ platters that just all looked cream covered with butter and sauce.   It all tasted okay, but can't really go wrong with it. The lobster tail was teeny tiny and not anything like the photos in the menu.  I just feel that money would be better spent on quality food at the same price for a more fulfilling meal that doesn't put you to sleep afterwards.   One of the main reasons we came here is that they have a an extensive allergen list for those who need it. But personally, I think if you just use a little brains you can figure out what you can and cannot eat and verify with the chef."}
{"text":"I'm only giving this place 2 stars instead of one because our server was nice.... The atmosphere was awful! How can you enjoy a hot dinner when it's cold outside and there's cold air conditioning blowing full blast on you and your food????? So my food was cold before I was halfway through it. Not that the food was any better than the atmosphere! I ordered something I've had several times before, that Bayside bake pot thing. A $30 entree that I shouldn't have even paid for. The pasta was way over cooked and mushy and the seafood was so bland that my boyfriend felt bad and gave me his butter to flavor my food!!!! Ugh, just awful. I'm glad my bf at least enjoyed his Ultimate Feast.... I don't think I want to come back, I found other amazing seafood places to enjoy a comfortable, tasteful dinner at."}
{"text":"It's been awhile since I visited red lobster. The food and the service is great. The only problem I had with the restaurant is there is a certain smell they have throughout the Restuarant. We had a server name Quincy and he was very nice and fast with everything. It was the first time that I was asked if I wanted a to go drink-lol amazing."}
{"text":"We visited this place during dinner time.waiting queue was big we thought it will take time to get the seat but we are just 2 people so we immediately get the place.we have ordered wood-grilled lobster,shrimp and scallop (split maine lobster tail and skewered shrimp and sea scallops with a buttery garlic finish, over wild rice pilaf) but customized the dish to lobster and shrimp only without scallop.service is very good and we visited this place for the first time so they suggested us which one to take.the dish was good.shrimp and lobster are fresh and we liked the food.awesome taste"}
{"text":"Red Lobster on Mother's Day..  As a person with a lot of experience working in the restaurant business, I am a firm believer in the worth of a restaurant being based in several components. I like to take a look into the entire staff, not just the servers and kitchen (I.e. food etc. ). I came in early to get the name of our big party on the list ahead of time with my younger cousin and was greeted with smiles, hellos and hospitality. I notified them that we would probably not be a complete party until a little while  after we got a table and the manager on duty insisted that we sit anyway. Now, as much as that is not an ideal situation for the restaurant, it was great that they were still willing to do that. The bar tender took the time to get me some coffee while I waited and furthermore took the time to leave her station and get cream for me as well.    Our servers Brittney and Keith were very understanding of the incomplete party situation and were very friendly and talkative. This is something that is always refreshing. They kept our glasses full at all times and were on top of taking care of us.   The food was excellent! Our chilled jumbo shrimp cocktail appetizer was very simple yet refreshing. All the entrees that I had the opportunity to sample were very well balanced, not overly salty or buttery, which has sometimes been the case at some red lobsters.. The flavors had an opportunity to make themselves known.   An overall great experience. Thank you."}
{"text":"9/14/2015 My wife and I took out my mother for afternoon lunch at the Champaign, Illinois Red Lobster on Monday 9/14/2015. Was greeted as we entered the restaurant and with a quick scan of the seating area, noticed that it was really clean. We were seated, received menus and had our drink order placed in a timely fashion. My wife and I each ordered the endless shrimp special while my mother had the popcorn shrimp. Our waitress, Lori B., was very nice and prompt. Did not have to ask for refills on our drinks and did not have to wait for our next plate of shrimp. I will be asking for Lori B. as our waitress next time. If I had to come up with one complaint, it would be the price of their sodas and ice tea. At $2.69 a drink, even with free refills, a glass of water is a bargain."}
{"text":"This location is a good example of how a Red Lobster should be. The food was good and the service was outstanding. Not an upscale seafood restaurant, but great for a seafood fix."}
{"text":"I've been to red lobsters that I would never go back to, and I've been to ones that rock.  This one is right in between.  Good service, good bar, decent food, no complaints.  This one is a-ok."}
{"text":"The food was great. A little bit salty, but one of the best meals I have had in a while. The staff was friendly and AMAZING! They made a little mistake serving me packs of hand towelettes instead of serving me crackers with my soup, but mistakes can happen. I highly recommend the clan chowder and, of course, the cheddar biscuits."}
{"text":"oh, endless shrimp, how i love you!!   the in-laws, my husband and i hit up red lobster after checking into the hyatt place in mesa.   jenna, our server was very nice. she brought out all of our drinks and provided refills (very important) throughout our meal.   i really liked the parmesan shrimp, linguini, scampi and grilled garlic shrimp. mmmmmmm i ate way too much.  wish we had a red lobster on kauai!!"}
{"text":"standard red lobster. came here after a very, very, very long work day and a co-worker and i were headed back to tucson.  we were seated right away, and our server was prompt to grab our drink orders and bring us delicious cheddar bay biscuits.  we ordered and the food was slow to come out. when our food arrived, everything looked pretty good. if it had not have been such a long day, i think i would have had more tolerance for our server. she just seemed in a rush and wasn't the friendliest."}
{"text":"The waitress was very helpful. The coconut shrimp and grilled lobster is delicious. The only complaint is that the lunch ends at 3. I like the smaller positions. Oh and I love the biscuits"}
{"text":"Went to this location for endless shrimp last Sunday. No one served water and menu until we asked for it. Also I was told there is no other options (secret menu) of the shrimp. Once I showed them the website of business insider which lists all the options for the shrimp, i was allowed to order.... still tipped 15% but probably wont go back for endless shrimp"}
{"text":"OK I had not been to a RL for over 20 years. A few weeks ago I went with my parents in MI. It was very good and the service was exceptional. Now I know that because this is a chain restaurant the food should be just about as good as it was in MI. Well thankfully it was. I actually ordered the same thing I had a few weeks ago. The coconut shrimp and shrimp scampi were wonderful. Unfortunately the service sucked! Our server took our order and must of not listened to us because when the meal came he brought the wrong item for my daughter. That was about an 8-9 minute mistake to get my daughter her correct meal. The manager came over and apologized. We were only drinking water but we kept asking for refills and it would take this guy 10 minutes and us asking for refills twice before we got anything. My wife ordered the four course meal and this server wrote down that, but brought the wrong desert. 5 minutes later it was made right.  Now we asked for the check after it was all said and done and about 10 minutes later this guy finally brought us our check. We immediately review it and slip in the credit card. I am not kidding here, this idiot literally shot himself in the foot when he took almost 12 full minutes to pick the damn check up. Completely pissed me off and made it easy to show this guy why his awful service got him his crappy tip. I really think that the service experience is part of the meal and it really goes hand in hand. I can tell you that if I ever go back to this RL I will not have that guy as my server again."}
{"text":"Came for a corporate event & the service was good. But everyone's food was shit. Salmon was dry & not seasoned, veggies were undercooked & not seasoned, fries were not seasoned & had been sitting, mashed potatoes had pockets of WTF SALT, Ceasars salads were inconsistent by lacking cheese or HEAVY on mayo or with wilted lettuce. Such a disgrace. Our company deserves better than this. I can't believe they paid for this crappy food. I wouldn't recommend this restaurant since their kitchen staff leaves A LOT to be desired."}
{"text":"came for the first time for lobster fest, lobster was delicious, but the lobster scampi was really greasy and not that much lobster, but the pasta was cooked well.   The downside is red lobster doesn't take reservations so we had to wait for a while to be seated.   Service was quick, but because it is so busy, the restaurant is messy."}
{"text":"Last 2 times I came here I got food poisoning from the shrimp. I recommend them to cook the shrimp very well before giving to customers. Maybe if your going to get shrimp ask to make sure it's cooked well"}
{"text":"Fantastic! Tonight was my second visit at this location.. Food quality was perfect, just like last time. Service was great as well! Ask for Teck if you want polite and welcoming service! I had the Lobster bake with linguini pasta.. It was.. DELICIOUS! If you get a chance, make sure you try that! The butter was a little over the top, but that's how Red Lobster makes it. Not saying it's bad, I just prefer the way Asians make it.. It's not as fatty, but still.. Tonight was too good to be true! Sometimes you have to live life all out, and eating is the best way to do it! Lol"}
{"text":"Perhaps I'm a bit jaded.  I know good restaurants and Red Lobster at Metro is fine.  Food like all the other red lobsters.  What sets this apart from all the rest is the service.  That's why I'm writing this review.   My wife and I went to R.L. last night.  She had the lobster pizza and I had lobster nachos.  She drank water.  I had Sam Adams draught.  The beer was wonderful.  The pizza is and has always been very very goodl.  The nachos were also good. A five star rating goes to our waiter, Doug.  First, he was an adult man who had personality.  Could describe each dish you ordered in mouth watering terms.  Made pleasant conversations and banter and was on top of all our needs before we knew what our needs were. Should you go there, ask to sit at one of Doug's tables.  YOu won't be sorry."}
{"text":"Red Lobster is one of my favorite places to grab seafood. Although we don't usually go here except for special occasions, the other day was a visit that stood out. While my family and I were waiting, we heard someone yelling, and looked over to see a customer screaming and berating the manager. She was complaining that there were kids seated by her table and they \"ruined\" her dinner (seriously).   Being a former retail worker, nothing gets my blood boiling more than seeing customers yell at people for no good reason. We watched the entire thing, and the manager was so patient and gracious. She handled the customer the best she could, even after being yelled at. This was the first thing that stood out to me.   After being seated, we had the sweetest waitress. I'm not sure what her name was, but she had a southern accent and was so kind! She had a great sense of humor and brought our food out quickly.  The entire experience was just nice. Everyone was pleasant to be around (besides that rude customer in the beginning, but that isn't Red Lobster's fault). My crab legs tasted so fresh and didn't have that grittiness like some have when they aren't super fresh. Biscuits also tasted fresh from the oven, and the sampler was AMAZING. Thank you for a wonderful experience; we cannot wait to visit again!"}
{"text":"I love Red Lobster.  I haven't been to this location in a long time... but I happened to crave some nice snow crab, so we headed out.    We went on a Sunday afternoon at about 4. The waiting area was starting to fill up and they told us it would be some 10 minutes or so, and they were correct.  Walk back to the back of the restaurant where we were seated... there were a ton of empty tables, yet a bunch of people waiting??  I can only figure they do this so the kitchen and staff aren't overloaded all at once.  They do have an allergen menu!  Lucky me, they had plenty of things that are gluten free for my Celiac afflicted body. :)  But I just wanted the snow crab, which was amazing by the way."}
{"text":"We went to dinner here on a Thursday night. The waitress we had was great, she always kept checking on us and we didn't have to ask for anything refills etc etc, she was on top of it all and so was the manager. We will be going back"}
{"text":"I came in at 6pm and sat at the bar. Allison was the bartender and she was excellent! Very attentive and my food came out right away. Piping hot! I was expecting to wait because the restaurant was pretty busy but that didn't happen. The quality of food was the same o same o for Red Lobster but if you stop in the Bar Harbor had lobster, shrimp, scallops and mussels. Worth trying!"}
{"text":"Today I went to RL with my boyfriend for a late lunch/early dinner. The drinks we ordered were mixed well. Our food was cooked to perfection, and our server, Kiki, was great. She had great timing with the food and cleared away our plates quickly. I also thought she was really down to earth and friendly. I will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"As I sat alone at home recently on a dreary February day staring bleakly at the Television screen a Lobster Fest commercial started to play.  My mood immediately elevated as I thought about summer and to me summer = seafood.  And with the recent Beyonce reference in Formation I knew this had to be kismet.  I had to redeem myself for missing \"Endless Shrimp\" earlier, and the only thing to do this would be to take my Wife here for Lobster Fest.  Mission accomplished.  Yes we spent Valentines dinner here, and yes it was pretty amazing.  The service was efficient and hassle-free and the dueling lobster tails hit the mark.  How can one not enjoy a lobster tail topped with lobster mac n cheese, this just seems impossible to me.  We finished off our dueling lobster tails with the warm chocolate chip lava cookie.  This was the perfect choice for two, as it would have been a bit overwhelming for one of us to handle.  This is as it sounds,  a giant warm chocolate chip cookie filled with chocolate and topped with ice cream.  Red Lobster you have done it again.  I apologize for waiting 5 long years to visit you.  Our next visit will be so much sooner I promise."}

{"text":"there were some perks to coming here and there was 1 particular slight let down i'm still unsure about at this point... i came here solo wanting to spend the rest of a $100 longhorn steakhouse/darden's gift card. i LOVE lobster but haven't had it in awhile and always wanted to try red lobster. well, the opportunity came up so i snatched it up lol. i got there and it was a 20? min wait, no biggy, and the hostess was pretty nice overall.. i stood by the lobster tank a bit b4 a free spot at one of the benches finally happened. i finally got seated at a table, typically i prefer a booth but hadn't asked for it so i accept that i got a table lol, and i figure other parties would want the booths, i wasn't being particularly picky at this moment lol.   anyway, my waitress was really nice and patient considering i took a lil while trying to choose what to get, and also when i asked for a suggestion, she happily gave it and she was right about it :). i had scoped out the menu online before i went, but the real menu has more items than online for w/e reason, so i was really torn w/ what to get! i was trying to choose btwn the lobster bake? and the 4 course meal for $16? i thought the 4 course meal (u choose 1 from the options of each category: soup, salad, entree, and dessert!) was a GREAT value deal considering other entrees by themselves are way more lol. but i wanted lobster w/ my meal, it's red lobster after all lol.. so i did manage to notice i could add lobster tail to my meal so i did, and all together, it added up to be about the same price of the lobster entree i had debated getting lol, so i got more of what i wanted for the same price as just the 1 entree :) good deal :)...   overall, the food was good, i didn't have the urge to spit it out lol.. the rice pilaf that came w/ my garlic shrimp entree was pretty dry tho, i had to add the melted butter from the lobster tail to the rice pilaf so i wouldn't choke on it lol.. but overall, i wasn't appalled by my meal :) oddly tho, before it was time for me to leave, i started to feel woozy. i know some dishes have white wine added to it? and i'm pretty alcohol-intolerant, my body has a really bad reaction to any miniscule amount of alcohol, so i thought maybe there were traces of the white wine or otherwise in the cookware or something? idk... but it was odd... either way tho, it was paid for w/ a gift card minus the remaining $4 and tip lol.   the real question: would i come here again voluntarily? lol. hmmmm i'd say at least 'maybe'. i do wish that lobster entrees were an option in the 4 course meal tho! and i'd like to get that woozy feeling i had, solved.. but thankfully, no food poisoning or anything like other yelpers were reporting!"}
{"text":"Its a Red Lobster!  Our waitress was awesome and we were here fore the 45 shrimp for $10 promo (im a fatty what do you want).  What better way to stuff your fat face with unlimited cheddar bay (my favorite bay in the whole world) biscuits and then top it off while trying to jam more shrimp down your gullet. The beer was a little flat, the wait was long, but what did we expect?"}
{"text":"As before I always hated The Red Lobster, but we had a gift card and they still proved to be some of the worst food in the city, granted this is not a 5 star restaurant but hey can't they give you lobster that doesn't have an iodine taste to it along with scallops and shrimp!!!!! Never again will I step a foot into this place again."}
{"text":"Who would Yelp about Red Lobster? I'm going to! Sometimes, the biscuits, crab legs, and fried goodies on the menu are what's called for.   I've been going to this location for about 20 years. The menu is the same as the others, but I've come to find out that this particular Red Lobster is a favorite child in the chain. Consistency and quality of the food are under a microscope here and the service is held to a high standard.   They know what they are doing here. I'll go back."}
{"text":", High quality service, excellent food. Ill be BACK. I love crab fest, waiter was on top of his game.."}
{"text":"Greeted by the pleasant staff as we walked in,  no waiting and sat to our booth, ordered drinks and then introduced to the manager  Bruce, a great start to our first time at Red Lobster.  Our first taste was the legendary biscuits which were soft on the inside and crunchy toasted on the outside, with a hint of cheesy herby goodness, brought to us by the handsome and mild-mannered Brandon. He would take good care of us throughout the evening.   We got half a dozen steamed oysters on the half shell, a bit dinky but the horseradish was amazing. I'd go for the raw ones next time and hope for bigger oysters.  Next came the salad which was your basic Caesar, however nicely shaved slivers of parmesan on top which was a nice flavorful touch, the dressing was light and not too salty.  I should pause to say they have a pretty extensive drink menu for those who like to get their foofoo fruity, margarita or tropical drink on, you are covered, as well a decent compliment of beers, wines, and standards along with virgin non-alchy drinks and smoothies.  We got the Ultimate Feast and split it, it did not disappoint, the lobster tail, crab legs and fan tail ( aka scampi ) were great! Along with it came some yummy wild rice pilaf and mashed potatoes and a compliment of sauces for each thing, buttery sauce, seafood cocktail sauce and seared lemon which were well paired. Everything cooked just perfect.   Would have finished it off with an awesome desert but wanted to go for froyo so off we went. Total was around  $50 which ain't bad, we could have easily doubled that with all the yummy stuff on the menu.  Red lobster did good. We enjoyed it and will be back for more soon! That's a rare 5 stars from me."}
{"text":"Horrible crab legs came out cold. Talked to the manager she said oh crab legs are the first thing to go cold. My sister-in-laws meal was very dry. Service was so so slow. We waited 45 min to be seated with open tables every where."}
{"text":"This is a review of the spur of consciousness in the moment while eating:   Did you just serve me PlayDough? That was so frozen it broke into granules because it refused to thaw like Mr. Burns Heart -- Doh!   In all reality I ate a piece of lobster from the lobster bisque. It broke like grains of sand. How did you master that pre-chewed technique.   'Cos I've licked tire tread with more flavor than that.'  What, momma got you an Easy Bake oven and you decided to open up a Red Lobster? I had one of those too, but you don't see me sucking the flavor out of life.   Each employee should line up in queue, present themselves by name, and ask the lobster in tank for forgiveness.   Apologize to each lobster before cutting it's rubber bands and setting it free. Praying that they maimed you for your transgressions.   The ringing from the microwave harkins me to the freshness of the food...  You can tell this place WAS happening at one time but it's just been worn away like an old shoe or Vegas hotel prostitute. It's like a build your own adventure story; and you made a horrible choice.

{"text":"My fiance and I came in on a busy Saturday night. The girls at the hostess desk were extremely friendly & seated us right away. Our servers name was Nate - he was phenomenal!! We will definitely be asking for him on our next visit in hopes of sitting in his section. He had numerous tables but was putting his all into making sure everyone was satisfied & taken care of. I've worked in the food industry before & know how tough it can be. With that being said - I really appreciate his positive attitude, going above & beyond the average server's job duties to make sure we had a great dining experience. The restaurant was exceptionally clean & our food came out quick, just how we like it :) Couldn't have left the restaurant feeling any better than we did. Thank you Nate!"}
{"text":"Food was amazing and so was the services ! Our server Nicole was great! Very patient and outgoing."}
{"text":"REALLLLYYY salty food.I mean i love salty food but this is beyond! Me and my fiance both Had a stomach ache couple hour after eating there.should of give a one star but only good thing bout this place is the service. Not going back there again or any red lobster!"}
{"text":"First of all the service was great, portion size was a little big for the senior crowd. I had the steak, was done just how I like it, but it was a little tuff, and for 22 dollars it should have been more tender. The overall impression was good, clean, and the server was knowable about the menu and specials. I know they rattle the specials off all day, but they need to slow down so every can really hear what they are saying."}
{"text":"Everything was awesome during lobsterfest. Our Server Samantha was friendly knowledgeable and help us with the special dishes available. A bit pricey, but we all had marvelous Lobster served 3 different ways. I shall return"}
{"text":"You don't need to be a food critic to know that the stuff you get at Red Lobster ain't necessarily up to snuff.  This location is right by my house and my roommate and I and a few friends ventured out, mostly in humour, to get us some seafood.  I got crab legs which were small and disappointing.  We all ate, but we paid too much money and didn't see enough return.  If I'd paid half the amount, it'd probably be a good deal.  Service was slow and orders got messed up.  Blah."}
{"text":"Horrible!  Went for lobster fest at lunch it was obvious  that our food sat under the lights. So over done at 40$ a plate  Could have gone to a nice restaurant!our check was 240$ left a15% tip bytes don't  know  why.. 1st time only time . The food must only look like that in picture.  Dine out a lot worst  ever!"}
{"text":"I had a great meal here with good service. Red Lobsters can be hit or miss but based on my one trip this one is a hit !! Thanks everyone"}
{"text":"Endless shrimp ends November 2nd hurry ! Hurry !! I love this special.  And this location is always just on point.   My girl loves the peach tea and maple chicken. She not s seafood person.  There something for everyone here !!"}
{"text":"Second time I have gone with my 2 lady friends and the second time they never said hello or I will be with you in a min.  Absolutely nothing.  This time we were smart we up and left.   Manager wanted to know why we were walking out.  We voiced our reasoning.  Unfortunately we have learned at this location if you are only women you will wait at the table for someone to approach you till your next birthday so don't go in hungry"}
{"text":"Howard you're amazing at what you do!!   If you ever leave we'd follow you just to have \"your kind of customer service!!\" #It'sRare #AmazingService #1ManCanChangeTheWorld"}
{"text":"The server was great, but the quality of the food was very poor.  The restaurant was dirty with the flooring and table being greasy.  It took quite a bit of time to receive my food.  Overall, I do not plan on visiting another Red Lobster."}
{"text":"Reached there around 6pm, and the parking was full, and pretty hard to find spots. The parking was huge for one just restaurant. FYI: They do not take reservations - tried calling earlier and failed to get a reservation. I mean, why wouldn't they take a reservation? I do not understand that concept at all. Either way, when we got in, the hostess said the wait time would be 25 minutes. And about 15 minutes later, we were seated at a booth.  There were 5 choices for this deal: Pineapple Habanero Coconut Bites, Teriyaki Grilled Shrimp, Hand-Breaded Shrimp, Shrimp Linguini Alfredo, Garlic Shrimp {via https://www.redlobster.ca/menus/specials/default_cn.asp}. What was also included were a choice of your salad and a side order. In the beginning, each person were allowed to choose 2 dishes in the beginning and subsequently 1 choice after the other.. I guess this was to ensure that you don't over order and waste their food.  I chose the garlic shrimp along with the shrimp linguini alfredo with baked potato as my side dish.  The complimentary bread came super quick, and our salad trailed not too far after. The time between the salad and our main meal felt a little bit too long within intervals. Service was decent - our waiter didn't really check on us as often as I'd liked. When we were done our first order, we had to linger about a bit while waiting on our waiter to come to us. We placed our 2nd order and not too long after that, we called for the bill.  Personally, I was kind of getting sick of all the shrimps. We tried all the options except the hand-breaded shrimp as it felt similar to the Chinese style of hand-breaded shrimp so we opted that one out. Our bill came to a total of $110, including tax. For that price, I would probably not go for this deal again as I didn't fill completely satisfied with dinner and the food was just okay. Also, please take reservations!!!!  Yes, I'm still onto that."}
{"text":"I had been a family tradition to eat here for birthdays and for anniversaries. We went last night for my wife's birthday.  It was very disappointing.  Just walking up the sidewalk, was disturbing,  there was a lot of trash everywhere.  I understand that trash gets blown around by the wind here in Vegas, but if the trash is against your main entrance, you might want to clean it up. The bathroom was a disaster,  looked as if it hasn't been cleaned in awhile. Walking to our table to be seated and I notice that the carpet and tile are in desperate need of cleaning,  not to mention random trash on the floor. I sit in my chair and see bits of food from previous users, food stuck in the cracks of the table. We were at a round table that sat 5 people, my section of the table was loose or broken, (not sure which) and was constantly moving.  As for me, I can't say how the food tastes, because I couldn't bring myself to eat it. Knowing that all the small things wrong that I noticed, I couldn't help but wonder what else this place has overlooked.  My sons petite lobster tails was tuff and chewy. One daughter got chicken stripes, little burnt. On a good note, our waitress was very friendly and helpful. The utensils! Some were dirty, a few forks were bent in odd shapes, a couple small plates had food stuck onto it.  I know it is a fight to keep a running restaurant clean and tidy, but a little effort would have gone a long way.  I have one allergy, Mold, and I was having a reaction sitting in there. So, somewhere in the restaurant there is mold. Could be in the AC, or the carpet maybe. Seeing how the place obviously needed a good cleaning,  there is no telling where the mold is growing. Attention to detail, and pride in your work place is a totally loss. We will be using a different restaurant for our family events from now on."}
{"text":"Wish I'd ordered the tacos like my dining partner did as they came with 2 sides, not that mine wasn't good (Seafood Sampler) but the 3 big tacos, with big shrimp in them, looked really good - and I hear they were!  Great service from Rania, great food on an very warm & no snow on the ground day (so weird!)!!!"}
{"text":"It was my family's first time visiting the place and we were highly disappointed!  Waited to be seated since we chose a booth over a table.  After several minutes or so, got seated and handed menus.  Receptionist apologized for wait and advised \"Christina\" (who was attending a booth next to us) will be our server.  Able to read menu from front to back and up and down, still no server asking for our drinks.  The place wasn't packed.  We were getting hungry as other people around us were getting served!  My daughter also noticed some people ready to pay were kept waiting for their server, too.  Got up and left!!!  Poor service.  Thumbs down.  All the way down!  Never will go back to Red Lobster!"}
{"text":"love endless shrimp --- great food and service"}
{"text":"You, dear Yelpers, are about to see a man pour his heart out... I have a couple of confessions to make to you...  1.) I had never eaten at a Red Lobster before...  -- I don't know what to tell ya... I usually go out to eat with friends, and not once in my 25 years of existence has anyone ever suggested we go to Red Lobster, even though individually they all talk about how much they love it... I guess it's not really one of those places you go with a large group. I mean, they have plenty of space available but the bill splitting would be nay impossible due to the expensive prices. I would certainly take a date there though, mostly because science shows that women are more attracted to a man's status than anything else, and nothing shows status like a $70 meal...  2.) I think I may be allergic to seafood :/  -- Every time I touch the stuff I feel funny for a few hours afterwards. Although, this time I may be able to blame the top-shelf Long Island Iced Tea (Absolut, Bacardi, and Patron Citronge)  and the Disaronno on the rocks, both of which were amazing and very alcoholic.   Now that I've gotten all that mushy stuff out of the way, here's the deal... There were two of us, my uncle/ family friend and I (we had a man date) and we ordered the appetizer nachos and our main course was the Crab Lover's Trio with side salads. I think the nachos had some sort of lobster meat on them but I could not really tell for I had never tasted lobster before and they just tasted like nachos to me, not a bad thing though cause I love nachos, and darn those jalapeños were spicy! For our drinks he ordered a couple of Johnnie Walker Black Label on the rocks and I had one top-shelf Long Island Iced Tea and a Disaronno on the rocks, we had no complaints about the taste or strength of our drinks.   Our waitress was a little slow in bringing our drinks and free biscuits or crab cakes or whatever they were (which deserve a review all their own. Those things are freakin' delicious!) considering there were maybe 10 other people in the entire restaurant at the time (8:30pm on a Sunday), however, to her credit, she did bring us extra to make up for it. The deliciousness of the biscuits makes up for their delay.  The main course itself was very satisfying. I've decided that even though I may possibly be allergic to seafood, I will continue to try new underwater creature dishes. The Crab Lover's Trio contained shrimp stuffed with crab meat (greatest idea ever!), some King Crab legs and some Snow Crab legs, all for around $25. I finally realized why countless men risk their lives every season in order to fish for the elusive King Crab... those things are a treat from the Gods. The legs are large so they contain plenty of meat and that meat is so tender and delicious that it melts in your mouth just like the butter sauce that comes along with it. I'm not sure if we were supposed to get one of those metal leg-cracker things I see on the commercials, but we did not receive any tools and had to use our bare hands to rip the crab legs apart. This provided a carnal sense of accomplishment to the meal but also made a mess and made my fingers really sore because those stupid crab have little spikes on their legs. Those little spikes might protect you from seafaring predators, but I am man! I'm on top of the food chain and I'm gonna eatchu!  Overall, it's not too shabby of a place to eat some crustaceans, chow down on some amazing biscuits and have a few strong drinks.  Oh yeah, the salads were useless... definitely opt for something else."}
{"text":"We normally aren't the couple who watches their pennies and dines in chain restaurants, but my husband had seen one too many commercials for Lobsterfest during the NCAA Basketball Tournament and was fixated on getting some lobster.    We both ordered the Lobster Lover's Dream with a Rock Lobster and a Maine Lobster tail and Lobster and Shrimp Fettuccine.  The biscuits were good, full of cheese and spicy, but my husband's caesar salad was \"made with old broomhandles\" instead of parmesan cheese.  The lack of anchovies really bothered him, too.  I had the House Salad drowned in \"ranch\".  The lobster tails were not overcooked, but the artificial Butter Essence served along side spoiled the taste just the same.  Why would I want a baked potato, mashed potato, or rice, when the plate already had pasta on it?  OK, the food wasn't poisonish, the services was very good, but I can't see us ever coming back for any reason.  I just have to mention that the Las Vegas Review Journal's gave Red Lobster the Best Seafood award.  With all the wonderful restaurants in Las Vegas, how can people vote for this totally mediocre chain?."}
{"text":"I was so excited to come here, being from Quebec and never been to a red lobster in my life. All of the yummy commercials had my expectations set quite high. The weird thing about this place is that they do not take reservations for large groups. We called ahead to say we were coming but by the time we arrived it was completely full so we crammed ourself onto the tiny high table on the bar side instead of waiting for something to open up in the resto. They were all out of my first choice (Coastal lobster and shrimp) so I went with Seaport lobster and shrimp. Everything was quite tasty but it was weird how my sides came in individual bowls that didn't even fit on my plate. I guess it would have been easier to manage if we weren't all crammed on the tiny bar table but our waiter did a good job at removing the random bowls as they were emptied. Our waiter paid full attention to us because I think we were his only table and kept supplying us with everything we needed. I didn't go that far into the resto so I can't really comment on the decor except that the bar area was quite cute. The food came relatively fast but they seemed to have timing issues with certain sides because they arrived much after the plate and some people got their plates quite a bit later than the first wave of plates... but I guess that was because we were about 12 people. Overall not as amazing as I had imagined but I would probably return because... lobster :)"}
{"text":"Diana m is the best waitress EVER!! but we have the worst seat in the house. Lots of empty seats but we get put in like a corner booth right in front of the kitchen door. We get to see everyone going in and out of the kitchen with the door constantly opening. Then you hear CORNER and then some workers yell when they get in the kitchen like a heyyyy whoooooo . But our waitress was good!"}
{"text":"This Red Lobster location is near our Lincare oxygen provider and so we stopped-in for lunch today.  It is our first time to dine at this Red Lobster.  It was a 5-star experience -- from the food, to the service, to the atmosphere, to the well-managed operation.    The best part, besides excellent food, was our waiter.  His name is Chris and he is a most excellent waiter, and I say waiter because he was much more than the average server.  He knew the menu extremely well and was able to answer our questions in great detail and assist us with making tasty/healthy selections.    My husband and I highly recommend this location and hope to return soon.  We will be asking if Chris can once again serve us!"}
{"text":"Service is prompt. The menu is really good too. Me and my brother went there for the first time and he did enjoy the food, however I wasn't that pleased. Place is really classy and goes with the food. I ordered shrimp tacos too and asked if they have anything spicy to put in it, since I was in a mood to have some spicy shrimp tacos. The waiter suggested something which was terrible when tasted. It was nothing close to spicy and I could not even feel a taste. If they couldn't make it spicy they could have just told me and I would not have spent my money on that. The only dish I loved was nachos with lobster dip! Over all may be check all the reviews for the dishes and go before. Love the place since my brother loves lobster he enjoyed his meal but I am not a big fan."}
{"text":"Got so sick while eating here. Not sure what it was but i threw up all in the bathroom before i left. Wont be back."}
{"text":"We eat here all the time and it's really gone downhill...went last night for my dad's birthday and had another bad experience. Will definitely be my last time at this location. They were out of Dr. Pepper and Pepsi. The waiter took forever to come over and even greet us. He brought our biscuits out on a small plate wrapped in paper napkins. They were also apparently out of the baskets that the biscuits come in. The biscuits were hard and barely warm. Food wasn't great... waiter seemed like he was either on drugs or completely distracted all night, despite the fact that it wasn't even busy. I have been eating here for years and if the waiter had been slightly polite, I wouldn't be writing this review, but he didn't even try. We'll go to Pappadeux next time!"}
{"text":"Great dinner last night. Our server, Paris, went above and beyond last night to make our visit great.   The food was terrific!"}
{"text":"So this was my first time at the Red Lobster. Can't believe I've never been before... I love seafood! Our server was really sweet when she was around. She was soo nice even when we realized we ordered two entrees that had Hanks (or Howard's?) fave shrimp. With no hesitation she was so cool and changed our order (I know, we're such jerks.)   Our salads arrived and we had no silverware. I thought maybe it was an \"eat with your hands\" kinda place?! Haha nah we flagged down another server who brought us some dinglehoppers.   I got the Caesar salad and the Ultimate Feast! That was a lot of food. Hubs got the crab pasta with a side of coconut shrimp and uncle got the steak and lobster. The food is exactly how you might imagine. Pretty mediocre but not awful. The best part was waking up the next morning to leftovers and not having to cook or leave the house for foods. That's the best!"}
{"text":"Poor service!!!! Doug our seafood expert was so rude!! He rushed us the whole time and while we were still eating our cheddar biscuits he cleared our whole table. Very impatient !!! I will not ever come back !!!!!"}
{"text":"Let's start with the good stuff. Our actual lobster was great, it was fluffy and so flavorful (which was weird at the same time because I'm used to lobster not having any flavor). Also the service was great. All I did was say \"My salad has a little bit too much dressing\" and our server brought me a new one right away and took the salad off the bill. The only reason it wasn't five stars was because everything not fish related was so plain and ordinary. So as long as you stick to an under the sea menu expect a good time."}
{"text":"Shrimp! Lots of it! In perfectly melted butter and garlic, plus pasta noodles. Can't forget the cheesy bread! Been here twice, and both times experienced fast, knowledgeable and friendly service. Thumbs Up!  Has anyone else been tempted to stick their hand in the lobster tank in the lobby even if the tank is meant to display the freshness of the product and not to taunt these poor, close to death sea creatures?"}
{"text":"Decent taste on the seafood. Ordered mixed drinks and tasted like no alcohol. Sent it back and ordered another and watched the bartender pour very small splashes in the drinks. Sent it back and just ordered a beer."}
{"text":"How is it that money has become king and the food certainly not improved or holding its own over the years. Sure get sick of the hype and the prices going up and up! Mediocrity has a habit of slowly creeping in, and displacing what once set such a restaurant apart, especially in its early days.... Although the lobster tail and chicken dishes were good tasting, it seem that portion control is running the kitchen.  I am prepared to pay big bucks for exemplary food and service, but the value is not present here. A rookie server was learning on the job at our table, but it all felt rushed and artificial.  Not ever going to return!"}
{"text":"I like to get take-out from this restaurant. In the past, I haven't always had a great experience dining in, but I've had no issues getting my food to go. The staff are always friendly and give great banter. My order is never screwed up and the one time it's been late, I got a free slice of cheesecake! Definite placement in the good books with that move!"}
{"text":"Excellent service the server was very nice food was great I recommend it to everyone they have really good drinks too"}
{"text":"Food was great, served hot & in a timely manner. Service was great too. Tessa was very organized and was patient with taking our order. sometimes I feel rushed when I go out to eat at certain places but she was cool calm and collective. There was 5 of us to begin with but we later added 3 more people to our table, she quickly helped us pull in 3 more chairs and added another table. Good job Red Lobster! I see you guysss :)"}
{"text":"once again this place has caused sickness....never again... good service....punishment and risk are too high..."}
{"text":"Food was great. Customer Service was horrible, our server barely spoke and also forgot to give me my sides. Never going back."}
{"text":"I went here with my sisters on a random Monday night for dinner. They had their special pick 4 for $14.95 deal which came with a salad, soup, entree, and dessert. We were really hungry so we thought that was a good deal after all. Boy, we were stuffed when we finished.   Salads - House - traditional salad with cucumbers, tomatoes, and salad dressing. Tasted fresh and tolerable. Soup - I had their tortilla soup which was good as well. Not as heavy as you think. Potato was really heavy and chowder was good according to my sisters.  Entree - Grilled Honey BBQ Shrimp - two skewers glazed with mainly bbq. I didn't taste any honey whatsoever - kind of a downer for me on this one. It came with some onion rings but I didn't care much for them since they were pretty greasy. Garlic Alfredo - super heavy on cream and sauce, could not taste much of the actual dish. \"It felt like eating a stick of butter, made me want to hurl\". Jumbo Coconut with Pineapple Glaze - \"Ohemgee it has pineapple and coconut shrimp so i have to get this\" - this by far was probably the most healthiest compared to what and my other sister ordered. This entree had broccoli, some squash, it had color!   Dessert = Key Lime Pie - A-okay. Brownie A La Mode - much better. Apple Crostada - tasted pretty much like a apple fritter that you can get from Taco Bell. Nothing special.   They re-decorated this location with up to date furniture - contemporary American style which suits this place. Great to bring family and group of friends. Service was attentive."}
{"text":"Every visit is better then the last!!! After every meal here I leave with my belly bulging and a huge grin on my face."}
{"text":"Ended up at Red Lobster on Super Bowl Sunday when Charleston's was closed. My Mom used to go to the one in Las Vegas with my Dad, and had been asking to go since she was last in AZ. Naturally, the restaurant was quiet, since everyone but the three of us were glued to the boob tube to watch the game. From the sounds of it, the bar tvs were tuned in.   We were greeted promptly, served those uber salty, hot, addictive Cheddar Bay biscuits and put in drink orders. Salad was AOk. Mom and Scott both had some shrimp AYCE deal they both enjoyed. I had a pick two option with scallops and shrimp, with delicious steamed broccoli side. At home, we are extremely low sodium, and I felt all night like I'd been at a salt lick.   Service was adept, and our waiter was kind enough to pack up a bag of the biscuits for my Mom, who enjoyed her meal and trip down memory lane. Weirdest Super Bowl Sunday, ever. But it was tasty!"}
{"text":"Went in with my husband for a quick date night, everything was just kind of okay... until I got the key lime pie for desert... it was hot on the outside and frozen in the center.  Our waiter came back and asked how everything was and I told him the texture and temperature of my key lime pie was unsatisfactory to which he replied \"oh yeah, they're frozen, they put them in the microwave to defrost sometimes \" I paid full price for my meal with an inedible desert. I'm appalled at the way your wait staff just brush off microwaving food, if I wanted to eat a  microwaved key lime pie, I sure as heck wouldn't be at a red lobster trying to have dinner with my husband. It's a shame. I haven't eaten at a red lobster since approximately 2009 and had a terrible experience then, I hoped they would've changed. Apparently not."}
{"text":"Always one of our date night choices here in Goodyear. Never had a problem with the food or service. Booths are always comfortable. This means a lot to me due to a very bad back"}
{"text":"When I have the longing for lobster, this is the place to be for me. Wait times can range by weekday and weekend. The menu is plentiful so there is a lil something for all, they also offer non seafood options for the picky eaters. The cheddar bay biscuits are addicting as can be and are limitless. Upon my last visit our waitress was really kind and attentive and provided good service. I was even able to get $4 off of our bill thanks to couponsherpa. My only gripe would be that they could have hustled a lil more. The place was not crowded at all yet the wait time seemed to be a lil long than what it should have been."}
{"text":"Ive never written a yelp review but after tonight's experience I felt compelled to. I'm normally a big fan of Red Lobster but tonight my girlfriend and I decided to treat ourselves to some crab legs and I was disappointed to say the least... They were very over cooked and the meat just fell apart anytime you've tried to open the shells. Besides paying $60 for two orders of crab legs that were no where near the price for the quality, our server, although I can't remember his name, was very attentive and made up for the below par food. I would not recommend this red lobster to anyone in the mood for crab legs and would instead direct them toward a local casino for all-you-can eat for the same price...."}
{"text":"I've been to this location 3 times and I love it. The waiters/waitresses are all so nice and friendly. The food is great and their drinks are amazing. I've had the tilapia Yucatán and it's amazing. I've also had the build your own plate and I like them as well."}
{"text":"We had to ask for biscuits (after dinner they still weren't served). Ok food, and mediocre service (she was really trying but she wasn't any good). She forgot our waters (thank goodness we had ordered drinks for the whole family from the bar) and the kids' side orders (really this was the kitchen as she asked what 3 sides they wanted but only two came out and it wasn't her bringing the food). She seemed too busy to provide good service but seemed like she was trying. The bathroom (ladies room) was disgusting and very messy."}
{"text":"Went there last night Enjoyed lobster steak combo.envoirnment is awsome.but diner time is a bit busy rest is ok.nice experience."}
{"text":"It's lobster fest!  Out of all the locations in Vegas this one is my favorite.  It's always clean, the staff is great, and the bread is always fresh!  Mmmmmmm the bread!!!   Everything was delicious.  I got the build your own with the salmon and scallops.  The scallops were nice and tender,  not much flavor though.  My salmon was cooked perfectly but I do want to let you know that they give a generous amount of sauce which tasted almost like a teriyaki or a honey glazed.  I don't like a lot of sauce on mine so definitely will ask for the sauce on the side.  Got a cup of the clam chowder which is always creamy and delicious.    The place is usually always clean, so is the restroom.  There is usually no wait at this location."}
{"text":"I visit Toronto every few months, and stay for a month. I go to this Red Lobster at least once a trip. It has a great location one city block from Dundas Square, and is across from the Huge Mall, the Eaton Centre. It always has friendly service, and reasonable prices for a quality sit down meal. I tend to order the steak, but the ladies I go with always enjoy the quality seafood. The fresh rolls are Amazing, and I always ask for extra to take home.  If you are American, be sure to pay in Canadian Dollars, since with the favorable exchange rate, it is a great value.  They have a fresh tank if you like to choose your lobster! Not sure if they give it a blindfold and cigarette?"}
{"text":"This is due to my experience on January 19th 2018. I went in with my family for my wife and my 8year anniversary. We were seated and then the s**t hit the fan.  We ordered the mussels appetizers and once they came we stated they were over salted. I was told it was to go the sea water they are in. Ok? Never heard of that before.   Next the main dishes came and it got worse. My wife ordered the fish and chips and I had a steak and rock lobster tail. The lobster tail was rubber and the fish from the fish in chips were greasy.  The manager stoped by our table and my wife stated the fish was too greasy. He left and came back with a handful of napkins to soak up the grease.    I will never go back to that location. On a side note Lisa did try to make it right the next day. But it was over all the worse place we have gone!"}
{"text":"I really don't have much positive to say. They were not busy at all. We (party of two) were seated immediately. Looked over the menu ordered drinks (mojito had minimal ice, making it warm not chilled). For it to be as slow as it was I have no idea why it took an hour to receive my food. When I say nothing and I mean NOTHING, on my plate was hot. I don't blame the waiters but solely blame whoever runs the kitchen and the staff back there. Just poor service on that end. By the time the food came out, I grabbed a to go box and just left. Had to go home and reheat the food, even then I ended up throwing it out, what a waste of my money. Please MANAGEMENT get new people in the kitchen.."}
{"text":"Food poisoning alert!  My husband and I both had It.  We called to let them know and they expected me to go to the ER and have a doctor's note! They wouldn't even refund our bill and after our gift card it was only $22. I guess it was worth it to them. They said they'd call me back for some unknown reason and never did."}
{"text":"Had family dinner here last night ordered the salmon, crab and shrimp plate, it was extremely salty to the point where I couldn't swallow it. I told the waiter to take it back and ordered dessert instead to get rid of the salty taste in my mouth.  As much as I love seafood I don't think I'll be coming here again if everything is served this salty."}
{"text":"Pretty darn good! It wasn't a busy night. It also helped that we didn't arrive until after 830pm this evening.  More than 3 decades ago, I worked in the 1st Red Lobster of Champaign as part of the opening crew until about 18 months later. At Red Lobster I learned to cook all manner of food. Other than their grilled food, I imagine the food is prepared and cooked the same way as in times past.  That being said, I am not a fan of seafood (unless grilled outdoors) and generally defer to a nice steak and baked potato. My guest will most always choose the seafood side of the menu.  I had a good NY Strip steak. She had a  \"Festival of Shrimp\". The shrimp was reported to be completely delicious. The steak was... OK. A couple of times I've had to send back steaks that are overcooked or tough. This time wasn't one of those times. It was cooked to medium doneness properly with a warm pink center.   Good food. Certainly not the least expensive. Which is probably why Red Lobster is only visited about once every 3 months. Had it been maybe $10 less expensive, it might have earned 5 stars."}
{"text":"OMGosh! Is this a new fish or have I just been missing it???  The Bar Harbor Lobster Bake.   So I chose to have it with broccoli instead of rice. Initially hesitant, as I usually hear \"white wine, garlic sauce\" and think I will have to add garlic powder to get the flavor that I want, but this sauce was so garlickally (I make my own words when excited),  buttery. The seafood was cooked perfectly. This is my new go-to dish at Red Lobster! My only suggestion, don't slice the scallop to give an appearance of more. I'd rather have less full, juicy scallops than slice them.  Also the bar waitress, Zoe was pleasant, but not overbearing. I worked late last night, was very tired and did not feel my usual need for conversation. She noticed this, checked in on me when needed, but let me enjoy my dinner so that I could get done and get home to rest. She would be a gem for any upscale Charlotte restaurant to have.   Thank you, Zoe! Thank you Red Lobster!!!"}
{"text":"First time at a Red Lobster in probably 8 years. I don't eat seafood, so it's not a normal place for me to want to eat. However, my roommate wanted to go so we went.  We arrived about 12pm on a Sunday afternoon. Our server, Tiffany was fantastic. Very kind, smile on her face the entire time we were there.  We ordered an appetizer of mozzarella sticks and chicken strips. Mozzarella sticks were still frozen in the center. We sent them back and she brought out new ones. Next, the baked potato soup was very salty. Then, the entrees came out. I had ordered the maple chicken. The chicken itself was dry but the sauce was very good. Baked potato was crusty and dry. It likely was last night's leftover reheated. Corn was also dried out and hard...also probably left over.  Roommate's shrimp pasta was inedible. There was skin on her shrimp, and pools of oil smothering the pasta.  Manager was nice enough to comp the meals since we didn't eat them, but we won't be back.  The only thing we liked was the free biscuits - they're available in the stores to bake at home now."}
{"text":"I came to red lobster for the first time with my boyfriend. Our waitress Barbra B was amazing. She was very knowledgable of the menu walking me though it. She kept checking in to ensure we are good. Her services was truly 5 star and we will be back to this location for sure.   Great food great service!"}
{"text":"This was my first experience eating seafood ever and I know red lobster probably isn't the best place to start but I figured I'd give it a try. We went on a Sunday so the wait was 45 minutes but we snuck into the bar and was ordering drinks while we waited. When we got seated I got a sampler platter to eat. I wanted to try a bit of everything since I hadn't had any. The platter had lobster, crab legs, and shrimp cooked two different ways. The food was great and our waiter couldn't have been better. He was super friendly and never let my drink run dry."}
{"text":"Haven't been to Red Lobster in years...stopped tonight and the place was packed...we waited in bar and had some yummy appetizers...artichoke dip...highly recommend.....table was roomy booth....there was 5 of us, ordered variety of entrees and drinks....absolutely no complaints....our server, Emily was wonderful ...never had to ask for a refill and went out of her way for us! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Hubs and I received a couple of giftcards for RL, so we decided to go for lunch on Saturday during crab fest. I ordered the crab lovers dream and disappointed is an understatement. This dish came with one cluster (which mine on had 3 legs on it (side eye), 3 king crab legs which were painfully hard to crack and crab alfedo with dry and overcooked crab ($27). My mom ordered the same thing and had items missing from her plate & the same sentiments as me. My husband reminded me, \"it's RL babe and I get it. Thankfully we had giftcards. Hubs had the king crab dish which he said was ok ($30+). 1 star for the cheddar bay biscuits (they did not disappoint lol) and one more for quick service."}
{"text":"This red lobster is the worst ever!  The last four times we've come we've had horrible servers!  Never again!  Go to Olive Garden or Outback or a different RL. I am currently a server and realize how hard it can be but you have to have some personality.  These people suck and act like they hate their jobs.  We aren't even problem customers.  Never again!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I am going to keep this brief and to the point. I tend to write more about experiences that I like.  Look Red Lobster is a National chain (almost enough said)  The prices are really high for the food quantity first and quality second.  So on this visit went with friend and daughter. The daughter ordered Coconut shrimp. They were butterflied so they LOOK huge but paper thin (Not kidding anyone). Secondly TONS of breading and super sweet.  Friend ordered steak and shrimp skewer. Shrimp never came and the steak was 1/8th inch think and dry.  I ordered TWO orders of tacos. One with Lobster and one with Shrimp. There are only three tocos to an order at 14.00 (that is a lot for three soft shell toco's. Well twenty minutes after I ordered they informed me that they were out of taco shells. So.... I did not technically have dinner. I had my bowl of clam chowder tastes like cream, no real taste of clam 10 bucks.  Also we had an appetizer; a lobster pizza. It is what it is really. The thin crust was kinda tasty. The cubes of tomato and fresh basil had a nice flavor with the sprinkling of cheese. I saw little flakes of what looked like crawdad's on the pizza I guess that was lobster? Anyway no hint of lobster flavor; even remotely. Tasted the tomato however and they were pretty good.  I also noticed that snow crab was 20.00 per half pound. Snow crab shell is heavy so a pound of snow crab is really more like 4oz meat if you are lucky. There is an all you can eat crab place down the street (30.00 all you can eat). See my reviews of bumpers.  Looking at the menu I can tell you they are experts at making a little LOOK like a lot.  Rather than relying on the flavor of the fish they drench many of their dishes in some kind of sauce, or cheese.  I guess it is not my thing. I absolutly LOVE crab and crab needs nothing more than maybe a little butter."}
{"text":"The real reason why I came here was to compare their cheddar bay biscuits to my own. They were just plain ol' biscuits to me. I ordered grilled shrimps and lobster tails and it was just too bland. Lack of seasoning and flavour. I'm used to eating lobster Chinese-style so dipping my lobster in butter was not gonna cut it for my taste buds. The only reason I'm giving 3 stars instead of 2 is because of the service."}
{"text":"As with most Red Lobster locations the food was worth the money. The service was amazing! As for Derek if you can. He made great recommendations and felt like he was with our party. Derek suggested the white wine and roasted garlic mussel appetizer which was amazing. There were a few that didn't open and he offered to get them open. He went above and beyond for us. I don't know if I've ever tipped as high of a percentage that I did tonight. We'll done!"}
{"text":"The only reason we went here was because my son made a special request for his 8th grade graduation. I would rather eat seafood at Long John Silver!  The only good thing was the infamous biscuits.The waitstaff were very friendly. The menu was a bit skimpy and too expensive for the quality of food we received"}
{"text":"My family and I went to Red Lobster Jan 26, 2018 around 930 -10p.  It was my niece 23rd bday and Red Lobster was her restaurant of choice to celebrate.  This celebration included my sister, niece and myself.  My niece and I both ordered meals that included shrimps which she and I  and noticed the shrimps weren't completely cooked.  After we both ate 1 each we noticed the batter was very doughy which kinda spoiled the meal, especially going to Red Lobster for seafood.  As we bought this to our waiter (Tom) attention he looked at the shrimps and replied \"yea they don't look done.\" He said he will have some new ones made.  After picking over the reaming meal we paid our check but 1st my sister asked the waiter as we were paying the bill if there can be something done with adjusting the check since here it is we're just about done and ready to leave and the redo order of the shrimps still haven't come out yet. (boxed to take home)  Tom left and came back and said the manager politely took $5 off of your $66 check.  While waiting for the redo of the shrimps we asked the waiter if the manager was going to stop by to see the under cooked food and/or apologize for any inconvenience.  Remind you management never came to the table when we bought the under cooked shrimp to the attention of the waiter.Tom our waiter said he would get the manager.  At this point we're all coated up and ready to leave and my niece still drinking her Bahama Mama while waiting for the redo shrimps, here comes a manager (Sarah)  When Sarah stood in front of our table before saying a word she did a little sigh and slightly rolled her eyes and said \"yes.\"  So as I began to ask  if there was a new cooked as I'm showing her the 14 under cooked shrimps left on the 2 plates between my niece and myself, I stopped in conversation as I was able to tell from Sarah body language and the rolling of the eyes and yes this young lady was rolling her eyes as I was talking that she really wasn't trying to hear anything I was saying.  I paused and said  \"I find it odd that after you were told that our food was under cooked that you didn't stop by to even see the food for accuracy.  Sarah replied and said \"do I need to explain myself to you?\"  Yes you heard correct, this is what Sarah said.  I asked her if she felt she should explain herself and she said \"NO.\"  I chuckled and Sarah slightly leaned over to me as I was still sitting in the booth with my family and pointed her finger right in my face (scolding child like) and said \"I had other things to attend.\"  I asked, something more important than a customer bringing to your attention about under cooked food.  I then I asked her to get her finger out of my face and boldly enough Sarah didn't budge and kept her finger in my face.  By this time the waitress dropped off the re-order of our shrimps that we had requested to put in a to-go container.  I stood up and surprisingly that's when Sarah stepped back and a coworker stood in front of her.  I'm not sure how long she thought I was going to let her stand over me and point her finger in my face.   At this time I'm going to assume an employee was watching this whole things just a few steps away because as I stood up a young man stood in front of Sarah and shelooked at him and asked him to call the police.  I laughed and asked so you can point your finger in my face but the minute I stand up the police need to be called.  By this time Sarah pointed and asked us to leave and I  told her my niece wasn't finished with her drink and Sarah replied \"oh she only have 3 sips left\"  I told Sarah I don't care how many sips you think she has but she's gonna finish her drink 1st.   When my niece finished her drink we left and Sarah and the guy (Austin) that called the police which he was still on the phone with them walked us to the door and came outside wanting to get the license plate of the car that we were driving.  As I'm standing in the parking lot I turned to Austin and told him I left from inside the restaurant but I'm waiting here outside of the restaurant for the police.  I told him they're going to hear my story because I don't think Sarah is going to be honest because my family and I didn't do anything wrong.  Austin replied and said \"I'm just doing my job.\"  Before I forget as Sarah was pointing her finger in my face my sister commented to my niece and said you can get your butt (ass)kicked doing something like that (point in people face).  My niece shook her head.  Sarah quickly replied and said \"oh you're threaten me?''  My sister looked at her and said nobody talking to you.  I think by this time Sarah realized that she was wrong and had messed up and was looking for things as a rebuttal to come back with something to say she felt we did. So, 2 police cars pulled up as we were waiting outside.  One said he's going in to talk to the manger and the other asked us about what happened.  I shared this awful story, he laughed and said corporate should hear this."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE!!! We went to celebrate our anniversary and we were very disappointed. We waited thirty minutes to be seated which was understandable, it took 15-20min to get some bread. Once our order was taken the waitress came back to me after about 15-20 min and asked what I ordered again. We asked for lemon for our oysters, after ten min of waiting I finally got up and went to kitchen to ask again for lemons. We were there from beginning to end for two hours and once our food arrived it was so late we just took it to go. When we first sat down we overheard the table next to us complaining to the \"manager\", we felt bad for her because we understood they were kind of understaffed it seemed. All she did was tell them how sorry she was. When we finally complained to her all she did was the same thing, try to console us. We don't need a counselor we need a manager to make us feel like she made it right. She reluctantly gave us a discount. Over all very disappointed and dissatisfied with this location!!!"}
{"text":"What a fiasco! Ok, granted, my fault! When they said a 45 minute wait - we should have gone to the keg or elsewhere but we waited... As entertainment, I held the door for people coming and going and was red lobsters greeter (brought me back to my retail days lol)   We were seated and served by Stephanie. Table of 4, by this point we have been at red lobster for an hour. We all ordered drinks and our meals as the restaurant was very busy. 2/4 drinks came to the table. Waitress stated that they had to go to the store to get ingredients to make the other two drinks. 20 minutes pass and no Stephanie. She comes back and asks how everything is going and then remembers the drinks, goes back to the bar to get the other two drinks. Waited another few minutes and we asked if we can have some biscuits as its 8:45 and we got to the location just around 7:30.  She said we were on the waiting list for bread... She brought out our salads and then the biscuits shortly after.  We waited another 20 minutes for our food to come out. The food at red lobster is good but we left at 10:15 pm! Almost 3 hours! I don't think anyone in the restaurant was upset, rather iterated to even care of the lack of efficiency of floor staff. Customers were not impressed and the servers looked tired.  I don't think the general manager scheduled enough staff. Maybe take one of the three front greeters off the desk and have them talking to customers because there is no need for three people at the front!   I know it's not fast food but 3 hours, really? The server even mentioned it was a fast night for service!? What? It is sometimes worse? Ps they charged for my birthday cake because my table said it was my bday lol $7.50 ! Haha please notice there is minimal mention of food. I love waiting, said no one ever!  #operationalfail"}
{"text":"Arrived at 5pm on a weekday in a party of three. Seated quickly, served beverages promptly. Got our order and was out within the hour. We did order three festival of shrimp orders and one came lacking an item, it was served promptly with apologies and more biscuits. Our discount coupon was accepted and the bill didn't hurt. Would go again when in the area."}
{"text":"The wife really enjoys going to Red Lobster  we went for lunch one day. The decor is not the typical Red Lobster. Very nice atmosphere.  We were fortunate to get Katherine for our service. She was very professional, personable and friendly.  The service was top notch and made for a wonderful dining experience. The food was good as well. We will be going back."}
{"text":"My daughter has been craving red lobster for some time now so we finally decided to go today for our lunch date and she had a great time! We had the pleasure of being waited on by Linda! She was amazing. You can tell she had a passion for great customer service and genuinely cared for her customers. In addition to her great service; the food today was great! As I get older I'm not so much into chain restaurants but today everything was on point so whomever prepared the food in the kitchen between the hours of 3 & 5 PM, kudos to ya!"}
{"text":"Great service! The host was very nice and readily accommodated my request for a birthday song for my daughter. It was late so I could tell the staff was ready to go home for the evening. The place was clean and the food was good for where I was at. They were out of romaine lettuce for the salad and offered my ice burg lettuce. Not being a fan nutritionally absent food I asked if I could substitute a soup for the salad. I was met with a mild degree of attitude from the waitress but was given the option of the soup. All in all not bad."}
{"text":"The food is always prepared perfectly. My fish is always so tender and juicy with so much flavor! The vegetables look appealing and are crisp. Those cheddar bay biscuits are to die for! Service is there when you need it; your server constantly checks on you. The bar tender (I think his name is Ryan?) is very friendly. I never have a bad experience at this restaurant!"}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant because my family enjoys sea food. We went two months ago and the food was ok, so we decided to give it a second chance. But this time the food was terrible. I ordered a calamari and it was over cooked. My partner tried the soup and it was super salty. Nothing was edible. What a disappointment! i will try to avoid this place in the future!"}
{"text":"Wow. How things can change for the worse. Customer service here has tanked!! Misleading advice from calling earlier to get seated for minimal wait time. When we arrived, our name was never logged in  with the hosted to tell us we had to wait outside for an hour in 104° heat.  NEVER AGAIN!!"}
{"text":"First time here, food was great. The Manager Brandan was the best help, with questions about the food and service!!! Treated us great!! Will come back!!!"}
{"text":"Food is delicious! Went for lunch was served by Justin in the bar area-he was THE BEST server! Very attentive and kind. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Service was prompt and attentive.    Cheddar bay biscuits were delicious as always, but I kept myself to just 2 so I wasn't full before my meal.  Stuffed mushrooms were pretty good and well seasoned.  Brussels sprouts were a tad undercooked and needed salt.  Asparagus was cooked perfectly but needed some seasoning.  The lobster tail was overcooked and had a rubbery consistency.  The shrimp was also overcooked.  French fries were well seasoned and crispy.    Crab legs were the star of the show.  Delicious.  All in all, a decent seafood dinner at a chain restaurant."}
{"text":"Worst restaurant & service ever ive been in pleny restaurants and i can tell this is one of the worst!!!!"}
{"text":"When craving seafood, Red Lobster is the go-to. I've never had a bad experience here, and this location always has the friendliest staff.  The menu is always changing, but for the best. The classics remain are all year around. Red Lobster has different promotions such as, Lobsterfest (new entrées added to the menu emphasizing lobster as the main ingredient) and All You Can Eat Shrimp (shrimp served in different styles: fried, grilled, baked etc).   The setting has dimmed lights, pretty casual and spacious, and remains a family environment.   One of my favourite things about coming o Red Lobster is the bread biscuits they serve prior to the meal. Everyone I know loves the biscuits for their crispy exterior and soft buttery interior.   Definitely recommend this restaurant for a casual date night out, family celebrations or if you're just craving some seafood!"}
{"text":"Last night I went with my family for a quick last minute dinner.   I just wanted to post that I LOVE THEIR COCONUT SHRIMP!  Especially it being paired up with their Pina Colada Sauce.   For $15-16 meal you get your salad and buns + 10-12 pieces of Butterfly Shrimp coated with coconut and then deep fried.     My favorite is the Pina Colada Sauce  made with PIneapple and yogurt?!?!  (I'm guessing)    Yum"}
{"text":"I really liked the food,the service was good,I didn't like how you have to pay for refills other than that it was good."}
{"text":"NEW 2018 MENU is Terrible!  Examples why:  A list of cost cutting changes:  - build your own, removed stuffed sole for cheaper tilapia, you can however buy just unstuffed sole for triple the old price  - \"lobster stuffed\" mushrooms replaced with \"seafood\" stuffed; which is just rice broccoli ends chopped up a bit, tastes so so compared to great before,   - salads no longer come with your meals, must give up a side PLUS pay extra  - sides are smaller  There's more but why go on. What gets me is that regular customers like me are getting less than what we are used to. So, we are no longer going to be regular. It's expensive and not great.  Red Lobster is a ticking bomb rolling down hill."}
{"text":"Great food and awesome server! Michael is our favorite server and we always request him. He makes our dining experience so pleasurable. He is the BEST server ever! If you visit this Red Lobster, be sure to request him: you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Watch out! Their biscuits you get for free are addicting and you will gorge yourself full before you would even know. Watch it, and keep some room for the real good food.   Of course this place is very well known for their life lobster in aquarium they keep out on their entrance. They offer however, a great variety of option for everyone's taste buds.   The outstanding part of this place is the service of course. The servers are so amazing and even cooperative with each other. Sydney took care of us, and she was simply amazing. We came in for my friends birthday and she gave us an experience we never had before.  Birthday song, desert, (and I wish I took a picture:) a specially decorated plate with drizzles congratulating the birthday boy. This is one of the best red lobsters I have ever been to. The food is great as it always is, but the WOW experiences was definitely boosted by our sweetest server Sydney and her team!  Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"This place is run by idiots. Orders messed up and of course to top it off the bill is wrong. Not coming back."}
{"text":"Got there Saturday at 4:30 and we were told it would be a 29 minute wait.  We waited an hour and then left when they told us that they were waiting on servers, not free tables!  The hostess asked if we wanted to sit at a high top table in the bar. Ummmm I guess she did not see that my mother in law was sitting there with a walker? Really???  Will never attempt to return. One in pineville is decent."}
{"text":"I have never such amazing service than i had at red lobster on marks st. From the beginning to the end, it was the best experience i have had in quite some time. Make sure that when you go, sit in hollys section. If it wasnt for her, i dont know if the experience would have been as amazing."}
{"text":"We literally waited one hour to be seated and then an additional two hours for our food. My boyfriend and I were disappointed as we saw everyone who got there AFTER US get their food FIRST! When our food finally arrived, my steak was basically breathing. At least they were kind enough to cook it two more times until it was actually medium. I appreciate the manager's discount to our bill since I didn't even eat the steak, but the server didn't even acknowledge or ask about our experience. We have never experienced such bad service #firstworldproblem. Do yourself a favor and find another location."}
{"text":"Well....all I can say is.....if I was you.....I'd go elsewhere!!!  I went to this Red Lobster on Marks St. in Henderson about a year ago....and I got food poisoning....badly!  So I vowed never to return.  Then I made a dumb decision to go back again last weekend!  I had the Admirals Platter....and let me tell you.....I got extremely sick again from food poisoning for 3 days....and my mother did as well!!!  I don't know where they get their seafood from....but CLEARLY something is not right at this location!!!  I've learned my lesson the hard way....and will never ever return to this dump again!"}
{"text":"Were hackled in the parking lot by a customer, then the customer followed us inside and continued to bother us, I called a manager and he was nice but didn't really handle the situation very well."}
{"text":"Well let's start with the front desk staff are total dolls. However, it just goes down from there. I arrived to the table to see the dirty silverware that was awaiting me. To my surprise the server didn't apologize, so to prevent getting more dirty utensils I went to the front to get plastic ware. When I ordered my food I expressed that I had food allergies. And made it VERY clear that they must avoid acid and potassium. I also ordered my fish and green beans boiled and steamed. When my food arrived, you guessed it, there was broccoli and sautéed green beans in butter and lemon. The server was no where to be found so I had to seek out the manager to get the problem corrected. Needless to say I will never be back and I'd advise you to avoid this place like the plague."}
{"text":"I know a lot of people have this place a hard tim becaus e they area chain but they make solid food at a good price."}
{"text":"Went last night to celebrate my wife's bday since she loves seafood, we had Sandy M as our server and wow what amazing service she gave us. Very kind and always checking making sure we where good, also answered all the questions we had since we couldn't decide on what delicious dish to get. The food was also very amazing, but thank you to Sandy for making my wife's dinner an exceptional experience. It's service like this that has us coming back time and time again. Thank you Sandy!"}
{"text":"Went here on a lunch break. I knew exactly what I wanted before even being seated. As soon as I tried to let the server know while she was seating me, she abruptly cut me off and said \"You have to wait for your server,\" and laughed. Super rude.  I waited while seated for 25 minutes with no one coming to take my order.  I walked out.  There's too many good quality places to eat in this area. Red Lobster is not one of them. Go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Red Lobster's always been an okay place to get a lobster-fix when I need one. I like their bread, & love their stuffed mushrooms! I say stay away from the coconut shrimp & buttery shrimp. There's some recipes like those that just turn down your taste buds. Coconut shrimp is too sweet to where it seems like they tried making shrimp a dessert. The buttery-drenched shrimp tastes way too salty. However, I'd stick to their pastas & lobster tails. As for dessert, you can never go wrong with the typical chocolate cake + ice cream. As for customer service, they're always on point with cleanliness, mannerism, & courtesy. Come for your lobster fix 'cause they do get busy!"}
{"text":"Birthday lunch as a trip down memory lane.   Dominique our waiter was on cue despite the lunch rush and the food was exactly as I remembered it  - Ultimate Feast!"}
{"text":"I hate hate hate seafood. I can't stand the taste or the smell. So I have been fighting my boyfriend for years about coming here.   I finally gave in and holy cow I was impressed. It didn't smell horrible at all (it did the one other time I came many moons ago).   I ordered the chicken with a portabella wine sauce, mashed potatoes and green beans. HOLY GOODNESS IT'S AMAZING!!!   My biggest complaint is they had NO Italian or Balsamic Vinaigrette dressings. Blueberry or Raspberry isn't a realistic trade off.    I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"The experience was absolutely delightful. Our server Keith made us feel welcome and appreciated.  This is so uncommon from most restaurants.  I'm pretty sure the ladies at the table were blushing from his kindness.  The food was made to perfection.  I can't believe we had dessert too.. If you go for dinner ask for Keith.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Linda was a great server! So happy we lucked up with her :) she made the experience very pleasant."}
{"text":"I haven't eaten at a Red Lobster for about 15 years, and my daughter talked me into going here. My previous experience (in Central California) was, in my fading memory now, pretty decent. This was a contrast.   The server was good, helpful and doing her best. She could not be held responsible for the food. Biscuits were ok/good, but not great. That was the best part of our experience.   19-year-old had lobster shrimp fettucine. It was okay. Just okay. It wasn't \"bad,\" but one would expect better from a seafood specialty restaurant.  Partner and I split the shrimp wrapped in bacon and steak with mashed potatoes and broccoli. We ordered the steak \"medium.\" The shrimp was \"okay,\" but the bacon was undercooked and rubbery. the broccoli was good and not overly cooked. The mashed potatoes were runny and tasteless.   The steak was browned on the outside, but bloody and red throughout. It was definitely \"rare.\" We sent it back. The waitress explained that this was how they cooked their \"medium\" steaks. When the steak came back, it had been cooked a bit, but was still pink all the way through and \"rare.\" We sent it back again. The waitress explained that \"next time\" we should order \"well done\" if we wanted \"medium.\" We were still not happy, but they did cook the steak well the third time (which we took to go at this point).   The manager came by with a laminated card showing a picture of how each steak should be cooked at \"rare,\" \"medium,\" etc. I was amazed: their corporate policy is to undercook steaks at each level (compared to what are standards for how steaks should be cooked everywhere I've ever been). (Did I mention I used to be a restaurant cook?) The manager did comp our meal, which was generous.  The staff really did their best, but the food was substandard and their policy on how to cook a steak is strange (and against industry standards). You can do better elsewhere."}
{"text":"??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"Unbelievably slow service and dry shrimp linguini. It wouldn't be so bad if the place was busy, but there aren't many patrons in here for the slow service. Portions are decent, but definitely not the best tasting food around."}
{"text":"Went to Shrimp Fest at Red Lobster in Madison. We were determined to break the bank, meaning eat them out of shrimp. I'm sorry to say that's not possible. Tried every kind possible but somehow they always have more I finally had to throw in the towel. But it was all good and would do it again. Short wait and a good wait staff I will give it another try"}
{"text":"Overall, it was a pleasant meal. We were party of 5 but they moved us to a table for 4 to make room for a very big group. In return the gave us 2 free appetizers. We ordered the fried calamari, mussels, and stuff mushrooms. I forgot to take pictures though. They all tasted great and I'm happy that we got to be a bit more adventurous by trying these appitizers. The stuffed mushrooms weren't that exciting though. I liked the calamari a lot. I think the fry in it was great and the mussels were very flavourful. After the appitizers I was already feeling a bit full. We also got a lobster bisque which was fantastic. Highly recommended. It was creamy and thick and had a very full and dense flavour. I would have liked to see more lobster in it but that's fine. For the entree we order the surf and turf, peppercorn steak and shrimp, ultimate feast, lobster bake or something like that, and seaport lobster and shrimp. All meat was medium rare. The peppercorn steak was the perfect temp but the sirloin was a bit over. The ultimate feast was massive and had such variety of seafood. The lobster was nice. I felt the shrimp was a bit disappointing because it was quite obvious it was frozen. It really didn't have much taste overall. The spaghetti that came with the lobster bake was very nice. It had a subtle flavour to it and was piled with loads of seafood. I also enjoyed the rice that came with the seaport lobster and shrimp and ultimate feast. I left way too full. I could barely stand straight. I would like to go into more detail but then my review would be too long and no one would read it. Just know that I was very pleased with my meal and would come back again. I think this place and a bit more of a $$$ place though."}
{"text":"Excellent service by Jordan tonight!  Red lobster food is average but her service was awesome. Please let her see this review!  Thanks for a great experience."}
{"text":"Service is subpar here and food came out extremely slow. I came here on a Wednesday night and the place was practically empty and even still with all this variables, the service still sucked. Food looked like it was left on the heating oven to long. The server was nice but that's about it."}
{"text":"Red Lobster is the Walmart of seafood restaurants. Eschewing luxury and stiffness of traditional seafood restaurants, Red Lobster capitalizes on the affordable, convenient market. Coupons are prevalent in various mailed circulars.  Coming in for lunch today, I didn't expect much and was pleasantly surprised. Despite not having any of their namesake in the tank at the front, it was not a sign of the meal to come. Our server, Anthony, took us right away and seated us at a booth.  The clam chowder was hot and thick, with many clams. The wood grilled shrimp tacos came picture perfect. I was surprised that I could get Brussels sprouts as a side, and they were very good.  I would recommend coming here again if you are looking for a quick and easy seafood meal. Just don't forget your coupon!"}
{"text":"I love Red Lobster.  I was excited when our group was going there today.  I have nothing good to say about today's visit. I will skip past how long it took to get water and iced tea.  We ordered.  Cheddar biscuits never came out until the food came. Food?  One from our group got his \"lobster bisque\" almost right away.  It was such a funny orange color, super thick, very salty.  The rest of us that order the strange colored bisque got ours about 10-15 minutes later when our food came out.  Seriously inedible.   I will skip to the checks.  Some people had paid and were gone before others got checks.  Lots of checks were wrong.  For 3 of us, it took another 10 minutes after the mistakes were brought to her attention.   I am seriously disappointed to the point, \"do I ever want to go back?\""}
{"text":"Can't go wrong I love red lobster! Big restaurant with a friendly environment. Got myself assorted seafood and I believe the drink I got is called mud slide."}
{"text":"Went there last night with the husband. Was seated right away. The food was delicious. Lobsterfest is going on so I ordered the ultimate feast and it was terrific. Loved the shrimp and lobster fettuccine Alfredo, it was so good. Also came with 2 lobster tails that where equally as good. My husband had the surf and turf and he really liked the stuffing in his lobster tails and said his steak was really good too. Can't leave out the warm garlicky cheddar biscuits, they are the best. Will definitely be going back again soon."}
{"text":"The waiter was attentive and helpful. The food was good and we didn't have to wait on refills. The hostess was very nice, seated us promptly and we exchanged pleasantries and she thanked us as we walked out the door."}
{"text":"Love crab fest snow crab leg dinner. Perfect. Delicious. Our waitress was wonderful attentive. And those cheddar biscuits love love"}
{"text":"Best Red Lobster we've been to.  Okay, okay, chill out, we're not massively huge Lobster Rojo junkies, but for (affordable) sea food in Arizona, there's slim pickings.  Our waitress, Casey, really did a fantastic job.  We were in quick, got our food much faster than expected, and everything ran smoothly, like the common well-oiled machine metaphor.  The food was actually really good, and I enjoyed my Peach Bourbon BBQ Chicken and Shrimp a lot.  Of course, the biscuits are amazing.  I would take off 1/2 a star for the pathetic salads they serve before the entrees, but that's a minor complaint.  The location is older, and, being next to a ton of retirement neighborhoods, you're likely to encounter more aged folk than highschool or college riff raff.  The old-fashioned tubed televisions hanging from the ceiling need an update, and a lot of the wood needs a little resurfacing, but other than that, no complaints."}
{"text":"The only reason I'm leaving a star is because I absolutely have to.   The nicest way to put this is that the best part of my experience was exiting the building. Attentiveness to refills was poor. Appetizers as well as main meal and sides  were like warm and the fish was barely cooked and rubbery.   Broccoli was barely cooked needless to say I will never EVER be back."}
{"text":"The most disappointing meal. Crab special. Crab was cold the alfredo had a brick of crab from a can it was awful. Manager gave new plate of alfredo however it was spiced up & nasty. Usually get a good meal here they need new kitchen help. It w be a while before i go back"}
{"text":"I did give this 4 stars, but I'm updating my review after a recent visit. The service is SLOW! We came here twice before on a Sunday. There is no waiting and we got seated right away. Thinking since they weren't so packed, that the service would be better. Not. Every time we have came here when they are busy service has been great, but when they are slow they ARE slow. Maybe not enough motivation for the staff? Don't know what's up.... However cheddar bay biscuits make life better :-)  -------- Original review posted September 2015   My husband and I came here last night for all you can eat shrimp around 6:30pm. The wait for 2 was an hour n a half long so we decided to eat at the bar (no matter what time, this location always has a wait). I usually don't like eating at the bar, but our bartenders were awesome! Before we even ordered we were given the cheesy bay biscuits and waters. Score! We both ordered the all you can eat shrimp and our order came out in less than 15 minutes. We were also provided drink refills no questions asked, which was great because I hate when you sit there with an empty glass and they don't refill it without you asking.   In addition, there were 2 other couples next to us enjoying all you can eat shrimp. Eventually the bartenders caught on and starting bringing out shrimp by the dozen. Without even ordering another round they would present different shrimp options to us. It truly was all you can eat shrimp!!! It started to become humorous because at one point they brought out more shrimp, but we were all so full and no one wanted it. Needless to say we left full and with boxes of extra shrimp to take home.   The only reason why I gave this 4 stars over 5 is because we did have slow service once in the dining room, but the food was delicious so no complaints from the food category."}
{"text":"Only have seating for 2 parties of 8 or larger. Avoid this restaurant if you have a large group. They do not have reservations or call ahead seating. VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!!!!"}
{"text":"It's been a while since I've been to red lobster and on a night I wanted something light and close to my house this won out. I decided on there 4 course dinner. I chose tortilla soup which was ok but not the best I've had. I had a caesar salad that was quite good as well. My main course was wood grilled tilapia which was fresh and right off the grill. The broccoli was quite good. The brownie with ice cream was a perfect top off and great to share with my little man who loved his little scrimp. Now for the service. Our waitress was the loopiest person I have ever met in my like. She spilt 2 drinks forgot silverware and straws twice. The service was just weird but the food was surprisingly better then I was anticipating."}
{"text":"Ok Where do I begin...  This restaurant  has gone downhill in the last 15 years, I would've given this place 4-5 stars then, now just 2 and its solely for the food. It used to be a fun dining atmosphere sans the waiter who had the Hitler Moustache and Haircut... But I digress... This time was TOTALLY different...  Seating Wait time: Not that bad given that we didn't have reservations.  Servers: I'll get to him in a few  Food: OK  Service: Given that we had to ask twice for our cheddar bay biscuits and a boatload of other things like pepper... It was mediocre.   Server: My server Morshed M was very polite in the beginning... but as the restaurant closed he came up to our table as I was about to take a bite out of my crab and says... \"Would you like me to wrap that up for you?\" I was thinking... Out of everyone here, why were we singled out when the dining area was relatively full. We hadn't been sitting there for more than half an hour, I don't omit an offensive odour, I'm not unsightly, we weren't disruptive and there were just two of us...  Our bill was $87.65... I think the $2.35 tip will make him think twice before he asks to wrap some shit up!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went to this Red  Lobster on 28th Drive Phx. we were so thrilled to get in /greeted/seated/served right away even though it was Valentine's Day!!  The waitress \"Jetsy\" was super/an asset to Red Lobster for sure!  She brought us extra plates and napkins/she split the salad/the huge Lobster platter for us! She brought us extra bread/she kept our water glasses filled!!! ask for her If/when you guys  go  :) :) :)   We definitely will go back! The food was A plus toooo!!!"}
{"text":"If I could give this a negative star, I would. I can deal with poor customer service, but finding glass in a biscuit? Unacceptable!  I went to this location last night with my boyfriend, his mother, and her fiancé. Our server was in training, and the girl \"supervising\" her was off at another table. I ordered the Sangria and my boyfriend order a Fat Tire. When the drinks were delivered, the server spilled the ENTIRE sangria in his lap. Luckily he was wearing leather pants, so he just dried himself off. However, his $300+ shoes were soaked.   To attempt to make up for this spill (let's face it, spills happen), the manager said she would send a comped appetizer to us. Well that never showed up. Apparently there was a miscommunication.  Fast forward, the meal finally comes. The food was great, thank god! I ask for a box for my leftovers, and we ask for some of the biscuits to go.   Later that night, my boyfriend says, \"I'm going to eat all the biscuits.\" I asked him to save me one, and thank god he didn't eat it. I microwaved the last biscuit this morning, and bit down into it, only to find a MASSIVE piece of glass embedded in the biscuit. I can't be sure if the glass was intentionally put there, or if it may have gotten mixed in earlier, but it certainly seems fishy. I will definitely be pursuing some kind of legal action & involving the news because this is UNACCEPTABLE and will never happen again. $87 (before tip) with a comped meal & appetizer will never be worth what I found.   DO NOT EAT HERE."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying the food was great, but the service wasn't good. Our waitress was Christine C, had to check my receipt.   She was friendly but she was also a magician ! She had the best disappearing act.   When you have to ask other servers to find your waitress you have a problem.   Will we be back ? Yes but I'll make sure we are not seated in her section."}
{"text":"Today I went in for dinner with two of my best friends. We were seated immediately after our entire party was there. Our server was Mikel. He did and amazing job. Our water glasses were always full he took our orders the food came out fresh hot and correct. I had an issue with my drink he took care of it no questions. He made sure to come by and check on us throughout the course of our dinner but wasn't annoying. I have not been to this red lobster in a while but it was a great experience for me today."}
{"text":"Food was absolutely fantastic, server was very nice and accomodating, loved, loved, loved the dining experience!"}
{"text":"We've been here several times and the staff is great, we never have to wait for a table. Last time I was there I ordered the lunch shrimp salad and clam chowder bread bowl. I think there were 5 spoonfuls of soup. I would have ordered the bowl instead, the bread was a little tough to tear and eat."}
{"text":"Waitress forgot our salads brought out meal , hair in my drink! Not going back!"}
{"text":"Remember when going to Red Lobster was a HUGE NIGHT? It ranked up there with Black Angus and Olive Garden. Big dinner nights. I haven't been to a RL in years, but had to go a meeting here, pre selected dinner.  Salad and cheddar biscuits seemed to have lost their flair to me, the fish taco's I ordered were simply.....\"fishy\" I maybe finished 1/2 my meal, quickly finished my meal and made a quick exit. Seems like everyone gave 5 stars to the AYCE shrimp nights. Maybe thats the nights to come.  Service was great and attentive, the place seemed to have a good crowd, but it just didn't do it for me."}
{"text":"Everything you expect from a Red Lobster. The manager sat us and took our drink order. Also the happiest walk through of the menu I've ever heard. There was even a small discrepancy in the bill that was handled with ease. There's a reason this is my go to Red Lobster."}
{"text":"My Mom, daughter and I walked in at 7:15 PM and absolutely no waiting. Sat down right away and waiter was right there welcoming us.  Ask for Rudy...very friendly and great service. 4 course meal for $15.99....amazing!! Clam chowder, garden salad, shrimp and scallop Alfredo and triple chocolate brownie a la mode....YUM. Mango Mai Tai was awesome...great dinner and girls night out couldn't ask for a better night :-)"}
{"text":"This particular restaurant is off Route 57, near the Ohio Turnpike access, at Midway mall.  Excellent location, and immediate parking is adequate, just not ideal.  The servers are extremely courteous and engaging, and the service is LIGHTNING FAST!!!  Within 7 minutes I had drinks, salad, bread, and entree.    Highly recommended!!!!"}
{"text":"Me and my baby had 2 of there specials hers was good, mine was like the last one of the night. She complained about it very kindly and they brought us entirely new dish 10 times better and what we had before and I'm thankful I know it's great.  The staff is very attentive!"}
{"text":"On a whim, stopped in for some crab legs and a good Long Island Iced Tea. Ended up sitting at the bar with \"Queso\" and \"John\" the dynamic duo.  I enjoyed a delicious crab-mania with both Dungeness and Snow Crab legs and a succulent ear of corn!  This accompanied by two Strong Island Iced Teas... I was good to go.  Ya know, people always have negative thing to say about Red lobster, but their cheesy biscuits, simple salad and meals are tried and true.    Desserts are varied and I have never had one I did not just love!  ...and NOW... every single item has a calorie count, so eat mindfully!"}
{"text":"A new trend is emerging, poor ordering. We arrived and asked for the fresh fish menu, to our surprise they did not have one as they were out of most of their fish.  The Blame for this lays solely on a poor manager not ordering correctly. We should have just gotten up and left, be we stayed due to time issues.  I had the wood fire grilled salmon. It was over done, and the quality of the fish was impressive as the color was straight from a salmofan and there was very little salmon flavor, defiantly not a wild sakeye."}
{"text":"Meal was what I have come to expect when I go to Red Lobster.  Noticed that the salad portion has gotten a little smaller.  Everyone in my party enjoyed their food they ordered."}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite places to eat.  Good food and they are always willing to indulge my wife's altering the standard offerings.  And the staff is friendly and courteous. A bit disappointed this past Saturday evening when we stopped for dinner on our way to a party.  The server got my wife's order wrong and then asked my wife if she wanted to keep the meal and take what she wanted from it as they could not serve it to anyone else.  So she did and took the lobster tail When her correct meal arrived the lobster tail that should have been there was missing.   We asked why and she stated the manager told her to take it off since she had the one from the other meal.  Sorry tacky !  Not what I expect from Red Lobster.   We'll still go back but very disappointed.  Barb, our favorite server where are you ? BTW - we've been going to this location for 17 years now.  Still love it !"}
{"text":"Screaming kids and frozen seafood. That is about all this place had to offer. After years of not going to Red Lobster, I decided to try it again for their \"crabfest\" special. Unfortunately, I was reminded of why I quit going here. Upon arriving, we were greeted by a large party with mainly young kids that were screaming and being abnoxious. UNCLE RANDY!!!! God you would think they hadn't seen their uncle, well, ever! Anyways, we were finally seated, unfortunately, not nearly far enough away from the hoards of screaming kids and babies. My husband and I do not have kids nor do we want them. We love to be able to go out to dinner but its gotten to the point where most restaurants are \"family friendly\" which usually entails jerk kids and parents that have learned to tune them out. Quite irritating and inconsiderate actually.  In any event, I opted for the crab trio which came with king crab legs, snow crab legs, and crab stuffed shrimp. I ordered the creamy lobster mashed potatoes and a cup of the clam chowder. The hub ordered the shrimp trio which came with two types of shrimp (can't remember what they were but when i asked the hub, he stated \"sh*t, mostly just sh*t.\") and schrimp pasta. He officially hates Red Lobster if you couldnt tell. Both him and I agreed that most of our food tasted as if it was frozen and from a bag. The clam chowder tasted canned. The cheesy sauce on my potatoes along with my shrimp tasted fowl and almost had a chemical taste to it. And most importantly, the biscuits which we had looked forward so much to were overcooked and dry. These used to be the best part of the meal but they have really gone downhill. Actually the restaurant in general has gone downhill.  The service was ok but I have one complaint. Although they give you crab crackers, they don't give you the other little gadget that you use to tear the crab so its easier to open. This would have helped alot when I was eating my king crab legs considering that they are thorny and sharp. Not worth cutting up my petite cute little hands to get a little bit of crab meat. Haha. To wrap it up, we will never go back unless we have company and they want to go there. Then I guess we would have to find something to choke down. It sucks because we used to love Red Lobster when they first came out but the quality of, well, everything has gone down throughout the years. The price however, I am fairly certain has gone up. If I am going to pay nearly $40 for a meal, I expect it to be fresh and magnificent, and I expect to not see a misbehaved child in sight. I am not normally a fan of more upscale restaurants but I think i might be giving more of those types of places a try after eating at Red Lobster."}
{"text":"Red Lobster has been a joy for decades! Good in every way but now the corps turn the screws like they always do: lure you in and denigrate the good things that everybody loved in the first place. Less and less and lessss."}
{"text":"Red Lobster is great for big box chain food. Above-average quality ingredients, huge menu with fresh fish always available along with the standard fried food fare. Friendly staff complement huge portions.  The place does need a renovation as it seems dated (as are many of its clientele -- definitely not a young crowd at this location)."}
{"text":"The five star review is primarily because this is the best Red Lobster I've been to. It's certainly not the best seafood you can get, but then again we're in Champaign/Urbana and it's pretty okay. The food is consistent and I should know because I rarely stray from my trusty favorites. I've also received very good service each time I've visited. Shout-out to my favorite server Danielle! You should ask for her. We have family in Savannah and my children have grown to love crab legs which leaves very little options in C-U so it's always Red Lobster when they're jonesing. Maybe this isn't exactly a glowing review, but for a Red Lobster, the Champaign location is the best."}
{"text":"2 days ago during lunch .... i was so upset with how the management behaves.. I will never return to this location again .. I don't mind that it's in a heavily homeless populated area . In fact I bought the homeless man infront of the restaurant a drink and meal .. moments after a heavier set Hawaiian or Asian man and a heavier white woman (both employees) came out side and harassed and mocked another homeless man . I saw them and said something to them the man mocked me as well and got very rude with me .. point being the homeless are not the problem it is the heartless humans the have working there that need to go !!!!"}
{"text":"I'm not a big fan of seafood so I always get steak when I go here. This last time I went the steak was so good perfectly cooked mashed potatoes were a little cold but still taste good. I wanted the new sweet corn cobette as a side but they were out of it. Hubby had a platter of fried seafood. That looked good he tore it up. We had cheese sticks they were good I love that you get like 10 in a order. The cheesy biscuits are great as always. Hubby had a strawberry mojito that was good I had a sip of that. I had Long Island  iced tea it was alright. Service was great too."}
{"text":"My girl and I have never been to a Red Lobster before, so we decided to give this place a chance. I got this crab and pasta combination plate for about $30 and my gf ordered just the pasta for herself which was about $13. At first sight, the food looks pretty good, but after breaking into the crab legs, man oh man..... You can tell the crab was old or has been cooked hours ago. The meat on the inside was all shriveled up and dry. The pasta seemed too oily, idk, wasn't feeling it. The only reason why I even gave this place 2 stars was because the server was very kind. Oh well, now I know what Red Lobster is like lol.  P.S. I also got the bubble guts two hours later after leaving the restaurant......."}
{"text":"The food was good. People give this place bad reviews but I guess this place is a hit or miss. The waiter was nice and the staff was working as a team. Food came out pretty fast and drinks were good. I will come back to this location based on my good experience this time."}
{"text":"So the call-ahead plan did end up working out for us, although I called 3.5 hours before our dinner since we had a large 20 person group. They were able to get 16 of us at one table and sat the rest of our party at another large table next to us. So my advice is that if you do have a large group, plan to call extra early and if you first talk to what sounds like a teenager who tells you to call back later, don't - ask to speak to a manager. Managers need to plan for overly large groups; they may have to call in extra staff if it's a slow night of the week for example. They did a good job in serving us by double stacking the wait staff and they worked together nicely. The drinks were served promptly but the food was served a bit slow... really nothing to complain about since they were working on 20 food orders. They did bring the salads/soups out quickly that held us over for some conversation before the big meals arrived. They got all the checks separated correctly too. Overall I had a great time and the food was pretty good too. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Good seafood and service. Wait is about 15 minutes on a Thursday night. Can't remember the waiters name. He was the best waiter I have ever had in my life. He was so spot on it wasn't even funny. Great service!!"}
{"text":"This particular location offers a gluten free menu in the form of a big, thick allergen list. While it is very detailed, it is also a bit time consuming to sort through.  I ordered the garlic shrimp scampi with a baked potato and side salad without croutons. (Be sure to specify no croutons otherwise it is not considered gluten free per the allergen list.) Salad dressings that are GF are included on the list; I got Thousand Island and it was very good.   My server Stacy was great!"}
{"text":"Great customer service goes such a long way. Had some trouble with our order and our server promptly notified the manager who graciously corrected everything and comped my meal for the inconvenience. We appreciate this kind of service. Extra tip was warranted.   The food was delicious. In the end, everyone was very happy with their meals."}
{"text":"Endless shrimp is back for September!! (ask for the coconut shrimp (they aren't on the list but, they'll serve them)."}
{"text":"Servers are down to earth and friendly. The food is better than expected for a chain restaurant. I go here to treat myself and am always treated."}
{"text":"food and service was outstanding our waiter was top notch making sure he kept our drinks full and making sure we were happy at AL times. The food came out fresh and hot and made to order.  Both the inside and outside  were very clean."}
{"text":"Our waiter was Larry from New York. He was very great and informed us the promotions/New drinks they had! The food was awesome! Seaside Sampler, Cheddar biscuits, Bahama Mama, and a Malibu Hurricane, drinks tasted so good, not too strong, made to perfection and the seaside sampler filled us up! Our first time at this location and we will be back soon!!!"}
{"text":"EDIT: manager came by to talk about the long wait for our food. He offered free dessert but my mom just wanted coffee cause she was falling asleep from sitting for so long. He went to get coffee but disappeared. He never came back. Idk about you but I'm pretty sure it doesn't take an hour to make coffee. I asked for the check then the hostess asked if we still wanted a free dessert so I just went ahead and picked something out so we can get something free to compensate for the lack of attention span everyone around here seems to have.  - - - - - - - - - - -  This place is a disaster today but probably because it's Mother's Day. Still waiting on our food and it's almost been an hour. Took forever just to get water and napkins after repeatedly asking the waitress for it. Usually I'm nice about all this stuff but she offered both of my parents water and didn't even mind or yet even ask the whole table if they wanted water. Also my alcoholic drink just tastes like juice only like someone forgot the alcohol???"}
{"text":"GO elsewhere! This place doesn't bother to pick phones after multiple calls for Reservations. While walk-ins have atleast 40-45 minutes wait time. Peeping inside the dining rooms, the place is barely occupied. (Not sure then why wait time) This happened two times in row...So we left both times....Do they expect people to wait 45 minutes from the time they arrive? Why can't a restaurant not take phone calls for prior reservation?  Not going to Red Lobster again!"}
{"text":"Food was good, but service was great. Our waiter I think his name was Kevin, he was very attentive and super friendly."}
{"text":"I am in Matthews all the time but have been to this Red Lobster only once. I always get the zesty chicken Alfredo pasta. And it is always good. I had two Bahama Mamas and they were awesome as well. But I must say the wait staff could be a little more observant of their guests in turns of refills. My moms glass was empty shortly after receiving her salad and she was almost done with her meal before she received more tea. Other than that our visit was ok."}
{"text":"Decent food better when part of 3 or 4 course deal.  I opted for $15.99 deal with soup (chicken tortilla), salad, garlic shimp skewers with rice pilaf, and key lime pie.  Okay, its a seafood place, but the chickie tortilla soup is really good and has a little bite.  Best soup on menu, really - yeah seafood place with best soup not seafood (this is what seafood differently means, maybe).  The garlic shrimp swekers are going to depend on attention span of person on duty, on a dead Tuesday they were prefect.  The rice pilaf, well its called a side dish for a reason.    Well, dinner #2 was seaside shrimp trio.  First part, more walts shrimp (4 is shrimpy in bad way!!).  The shrimp skampy was average at best.  The shrimp linguini is always very good.  All said and done this is a safe choice but there are other choices that are better here.  Average food at a little more than average prices.  I'd split the review to two and half stars, but service is mostly good here.  If wait staff could cook food, maybe it would be better."}
{"text":"I'm really disappointed in the service at this location. Today we went in, and waited 25 minutes to be seated. That is fine, especially for a Friday evening. But then we waited another 15 to 20 minutes for a server that never showed up. This is not the first time we've had terrible service. There was another time that  we waited over an hour for food that we ordered. It took so long that we had it boxed as soon as it got to the table. There was another time that the food I ordered came over cooked. This was the final straw.  We will not be coming back. Don't waste your time or money on this place."}
{"text":"1/27 I always Tip the takeout person but, WHY WHY WHY should I, if you are going to keep during a half a.. job. Yes, I believe I was crazy to spend this type of money on takeout, when my own cooking taste better. They did not give me any lemons or any melted butter for my lobster plate and my order of crab legs, as well as no utensils ect... I WANT MY TIP MONEY BACK because you really didn't earned it."}
{"text":"Walked here from our hotel exhausted after a long day and wanted to eat.  Our order was mussels, a grilled Caesar salad with shrimp and the lobster, shrimp and salmon platter.  Our server was nice and got our order correct but the order is where things went sour.  I asked for a side salad with no tomatoes and basically got a bowl of lettuce with a sprinkling of cheese and a few croutons.  The mussels and Caesar salad were much much better and of course the biscuits.  But my combo platter?  Shrimp? Good.  Lobster? Pretty good? Salmon? ICK!  Salmon should taste like salmon not like old fishy fish.  I know the difference! I eat salmon sushi, I cook salmon - this stuff I couldn't eat.  When we got our bill the server asked if I wanted a box for the salmon and I told her how ick it smelled and tasted.  She got the manager over to see us (without my asking) who apologized and in the end took my platter off our bill.  In the end while it wasn't the best of experiences if I were to be in the area again I would return but wouldn't touch the salmon."}
{"text":"Full disclosure I can't rate this place at zero!  Ok maybe rating Saturday night isn't fair when 15 tables are open and they are way under staffed.  Let's just say this is a birthday gone bad. How bad? well we'll start with a wait at the bar with $10 watered down drinks.    That would be the last thing paid for!  So there's a long wait for a table. Again they're under staffed on Saturday night. Who know people would be here for weekend? !  But sorry we are here for lobster, shrimp and scallops (wood fired meal). It was really, really bad. As in frozen shrimp barely defrosted. Lobster trail burned on top and cold underneath. The scallops were good! One out of three is bad! Even the cheddar biscuits wetter tiny and not worth trip. I wish it was better.  Drive somewhere else and seafood differently.  Like good!"}
{"text":"I am saddened that I have to write this review. I usually love this restaurant, but tonight it was disastrous. Our actual waiter came by our table all of 2 times and refilled our drinks maybe twice. The rest of our service relied on what appeared to be a manager and a completely different waiter. We waited about 20 minutes after our drink order before the waiter came to get our actual order. The appetizer my fiancée ordered took 15 minutes to get to the table and 5 minutes later out came the food delivered by a different person. What is the point of an appetizer if your main course comes directly after it. We never got a new basket of biscuits.  I won't say that I will never return because this one time, but an apology would have been nice after waiting 45 minutes for our actual meal. Step up the game Red Lobster."}
{"text":"I always have great expectations when I got to Red Lobster especially after watching their commercials.  But after I go I feel like I've been in a Denny's for Seafood.   Blah...."}
{"text":"The service here is terrible but I guess that's to be expected when you are seated in a section that no one else is in. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Certainly not the best seafood in the world... but well, remember we are in Pittsburgh! acceptable food at acceptable price; worth a try!"}
{"text":"Decent, busy ass crazy! good service, chain seafood what can you really expect?"}
{"text":"It's been a while since I've eaten at Red Lobster and boy has it really fallen off.  The place was dirty.  I'm talking nobody coming by once to pick up the dropped food on the floor even after the party left.  I ordered the Ultimate Feast.  I love lobster tail; I never thought I'd see the day when I'd spit it out.  The shrimp was salty and pretty sad...I guess the bigger, more succelent ones got laid off.   I know times are hard, but damn!  I walked away with an upset stomach.  I had a gift card, but the food and service wasn't even worth the gas I used driving there.  I contributed to global warming for that s***?"}
{"text":"The new peppercorn panko calamari is gross..  Why did Red Lobster change a good thing with broccoli, red pepper, and calamari with the orginal breading. Manager very nice at this location. Madi amazing and awesome bartender and takeout server... thanks for everything"}
{"text":"Had an awesome time with our server name Sean. Sean had an awesome attitude, great personality, and very fun. Sean made sure we had everything we need at all times. The biscuits was on point as always. Right on time with the food."}
{"text":"I have never been so disappointed in Red Lobster. We had the absolute worst meal I've ever had any where. I couldn't get what I wanted so I settled for mussels which were stone cold, and sitting in something they called butter but it wasn't. It was like eating a handful of salt. My guest had the ceasar salad which was soaked with dressing that he couldn't eat it. This has happened the last 4 times we've been there. His meal arrived at the same time as mine and was cold. I hate to say it but our server was extremely slow and I think that is why our food was cold. I paid $75 for this and that is a lot of money for me. I now understand why my friends won't go there. Unfortunately, I will never return to any Red Lobster. It was so disgusting!"}
{"text":"Do not bother going to this place. Red Lobster overcharges for the sub par food that is served.  I can make seafood at home way better than this place.  The menu recently changed and one of my favorite items was no longer available.  The staff is unprofessional. My order was wrong and my tickets was wrong.  I was charged for something that I did not order. We were sat in the back near the kitchen and the floor was disgustingly dirty. The wait staff congregated back there to talk. The manager was right along with them. I will never go back to Red Lobster and it's sad because I used to enjoy it, but bad food, dirt, and bad service for their hefty price, not again!"}
{"text":"I would give no stars if it was an option. I am NEVER going back. Server Kelsey was the worst. Endless shrimp is a joke since I only received first two choices- then the bill- I THOUGHT IT WAS ENDLESS SHRIMP! Mediterranean shrimp was PLAIN grilled shrimp skewer. Asked to speak with manager and we were told 'manager too busy to speak to us....WOW"}
{"text":"The worst experience my wife and me ever had going to a restaurant. We went there for dinner on May 1st. and we both got sick 30 minutes after leaving the Pineville Red Lobster. We called to get a refund and all we got was a runaround. Don't waste you money at this nasty place!"}
{"text":"We stopped here when we were at Great Northern Mall. Robyn our server is the best! She remembered us from a previous visit (a year ago!) and took the best care of us. We had 2 three year olds with us and she didn't miss a beat. She anticipated our needs and the kids food came first which was wonderful. We were able to enjoy the kids and lunch! The adults had salmon and it was perfection. Food was fresh and tasty. Will definitely be back when we're in town. Came back for lunch yesterday and we continue to be impressed. The food was fresher and tastier than ever. The shrimp pasta, crisp Caesar salad, and cheddar rolls... perfection. This is our favorite Red Lobster location by far and Robyn our server is attentive and prompt.  This restaurant and staff aims to please and is a great place to relax and unwind after shopping."}
{"text":"I was a little hesitant to try red lobster due to the reviews but I'm glad I did. We started with the sweet chili appetizer and then a meal. I forgot the name of it but it had lobster and grilled shrimp! All very good. You also can't go wrong with the cheddar biscuits! It was all enough food to split between two people. I will def be back one day to try other things when I get a seafood craving. Thanks again!"}
{"text":"Finally heard from Corporate and they reimbursedy full tab with a gift card.  Used it at one of their restaurants in NW Indiana. Facility appeared cleaner at first look, but the ladies' room was disgusting and gave me pause in anticipating my dinner.  My companion's order came out incorrectly, but I will say the server simply added the omitted food to his order at no extra charge to us.  However, the food was still sub-par and overpriced. Thanks for the freebie, Red Lobster, but i will never darken your doors again."}
{"text":"Very lovely restaurant with excellent quality of food. My boyfriend and I had a lovely meal there. Our server is friendly too. I ordered a 12 oz New York strip with a lobster tail. So delicious. The biscuits are nice too."}
{"text":"Joes crab shack closed. Going to Olive Garden to make up. Crab legs were great. Had the ultimate feast...Wow"}
{"text":"Clearly, Red Lobster has raised their prices last we visited there. We had Lobster Stuffed Mushrooms for appetizer ($9.79) and the Lobster Lover's Dream for $35.99 - which really wasn't worth the price. Both lobsters (Maine and Rock) were chewy and tough. Not at all tender like it SHOULD be, especially given the price! Don't think we'll be back. Too pricey for what you get."}
{"text":"I gotta say...haven't been to Red Lobster is a while because I've always thought of it to be gross and fattening.  Well to my surprise I got a great grilled salmon lunch with a rice pilaf & broccoli for a reasonable price.  The service was fantastic and I would certainly recommend the Scottsdale location."}
{"text":"Since the renovations, it's a nicer looking restaurant. The cheddar biscuits are addicting and the food is ok for what you get. The tarter sauce is also so tasty."}
{"text":"Their food is always amazing! Their shrimp tacos are sooooo good! And if you go for lunch during the weekday it is on the lunch special."}
{"text":"Ok so I grew up in New England, so I am fond of lobster, crab cakes, and fishies. In the last few years I've really gone on a seafood binge. There is just nothing better than a lobster dipped in a vat of butter, and I feel no guilt, about throwing them in a boiling pot of water. Crab legs are fantastic when served right, and while rockfish is the best non-clawed seafood item.  If I was to own a seafood restaurant, I would get rid of all the posh decors, and make it look like a barge from Alaska's Deadly Catch television series.  You would get fresh seafood brought in that day, but I couldn't promise the best of service, but rather a more salty experience from the staff that I would hire. There would be a crabbing vessel simulator that the kids could play in, after taking the required Dramamine to prevent messes, and the B-52's \"Rock Lobster\" would get played often over the stereo system.   While some may not like this approach, I find Red Lobster to be rather boring. Its just too corporate, and lacks any creativity, as I cannot tell one location from another. Even other large corporations allow for some individuality with regards to dining areas and decorations, but each Red Lobster looks like a cookie cutter project designed by the geniuses at headquarters. There are simple booths and tables, set fairly well apart from each other, and the usual paintings of maritime activity. You can expect to see a few lobster traps, and a fishing reel, but there's not much more to make your meal more visually appealing.   There are some hits on the menu though, I have found a favorite on the Red Lobster menu. I am absolutely in love with their Skewered Jumbo Shrimp Meal. At a cost of $14.75, you get a wonderful value for the money with this, and these shrimp are huge. They remind me of the ones you can sometimes get at the D.C. Wharf, or certain Chinese restaurants, because they are the biggest shrimp I've ever seen and eaten. They are marinated with delicious spices, brought to you fully cooked on the skewers off of the grill, and they are placed upon rice and broccoli. The lobster butter adds a bit of flavor, although it doesn't need a lot, as these shrimp have just the right amount of spices to them.   I like the Snow Crab Legs Meal, which is a pound of these tasty morsels. The legs are gigantic as well, and they've always been steamed to perfection. A lot of places seem to mess up crab legs, because I've often had rubbery crab legs that didn't taste very good. With Red Lobster you can rest assured, much like you used to be able to at the now out of business Chesapeake Bay Restaurants, that your crab legs will be cooked just right. They are great with the sauce, and I like these with a side of broccoli as well, and their price of $17.99 is competitive. You can order an additional pound for $4.99, which makes it an even better deal.   The one meal that I had at Red Lobster that was a great disappointment, was the Ultimate Feast. This is supposed to be their signature meal, and at $25 I do expect to be amazed, since that is a considerable amount of money for a dinner. Their lobster tail was hideous, because it suffered from freezer burn. In addition, the meat wasn't fresh, which the freezing and thawing couldn't save, and it wasn't even split open properly. The fried shrimp that come with it are so heavily breaded, that you'll need at least two glasses of water to quench your thirst. While the crab legs and garlic shrimp are great, they can't make up for the main two failures, and especially this hideous waste of perfectly good lobster.   Service has been a major disappointment, and a contributing factor to why I cannot recommend this chain. Each time I have gone for lunch or dinner, even on weekdays, there has been a wait for a table. It would be one thing if the food was that good, but since it is not, I'd rather not waste my time. In addition, a lot of these lines are due to staff disorganization, with hosts of high school age, that just seem to be collecting a paycheck. I could be wrong about this, but there is a serious disconnect at the front desk, from the rest of the dining areas.  There have been occasions where I've had average service at a Red Lobster, but for the most time I have felt alone and neglected. I don't know if they just don't have enough employees, and they are giving their servers six or seven tables, but there just isn't a lot of personal atttention here."}
{"text":"Service at this location is good, better then most red lobsters. There has been some police issues involving this red lobster, but definitely not red lobsters fault. Parking lot for the location this is in is very under lit and is partly shared with a golden corral which leads to me looking over my shoulder to and from my car :(  Food is good, havnt had a bad meal, but obviously all pre made."}
{"text":"I don't cook, so I dine out A LOT!  Great service is what I demand and today I got great service! Farrah our Food Server was on top of it, not only does she greet you with a smile, she is just as friendly as can be.. Our lunch was AWESOME!! Farrah kept our drinks filled, checked on us repeatedly and suggested great choices for us. I say keep up the good work, because I will be back! I am Happy Happy Happy!"}
{"text":"Today I decided to try the Lobster Roll .. it's advertising made it look really good ...  The waitress was awesome the service was fantastic   1 Star ( or less for the food )   What I got is no way close to what is being advertised.  The  lunch portion comes with 2 Lobster Rolls and fries - what I got was horrible it was mushy shredded  and not good  What a ripoff.  Look at the pictures and tell me this is false advertising and misleading.   If you advertise something  Deliver what you promise"}
{"text":"The food came out fast but upset my stomach bad. Been in the bathroom a while. The salad was soggy like they put water in their dressing. Also the Mac and cheese is Kraft dinner -_-"}
{"text":"I can't  imagine  Red Lobster ever being a substitute  for  a  fish camp but all of the fish camps around us have closed. We even drove  to  Rock Hill to the Mayflower  Restaurant  only to discover  that  it had  gone  under too!  So we drove  back  to  Pineville  to Red Lobster. My wife wanted  white fish but all they had was fish and chips. We ordered  two portions  along with some  coconut  shrimp. The section  that we are in contains  several screaming children, wonderful... Our  waitress  is Eva. She brought  our drinks right away and our orders are in, hopefully  the food will be good.  Well the coconut shrimp were kind of bland and the sauce that accompanied them really didn't liven them up. The fish and chips was tasty. The cod was light & fluffy & cooked to perfection and definitely hit the spot. The French fries were decent as well."}
{"text":"So I haven't been to Red Lobster since... since I used to dive into that little toy treasure chest and fish myself out a plastic knick-knack to keep my entertained on the ride home to play my NES. But its safe to say when I think of Red Lobster, I don't really take it too seriously as a quality restaurant. When I was younger I used to think of it as high end seafood, but as an older gent I think of it as more low end seafood. Like a Long John Silvers inside a Swiss Chalet shell.  Why would I go to Red Lobster if I don't hold it in high regard? Well the mrs. got a gift card from her parents and we figured \"what the hell\". There was one where we were going that day anyway.  The staff was nice, the food is gross. It lived up to a rep I had not experienced first had.  The biscuits they bring to the table are ok at first, but you realize just how salty they are.   The Caesar salad was passable, but forgettable.  Them the main course, king crab legs and garlic butter shrimp. The shrimp were slimy. Essentially served in a dish of butter and water, not just butter. The crab, boiled to shit! I always thought it was hard to screw up crab, but they did. When you snapped a crab leg, the meat snapped too. There was no firmness to it, which mean ripping the whole shell apart to get to the meat (which was flaky and stuck to the sides of the shelf).   On top of this, all this food was super salty too.   Bottom line, Red Lobster made me want to barf, as did the fact I had to pay $37 on top of the $25 gift card for what is one of the worst meals I've had.  Now I understand there might be die hard Red Lobster fans out there who hate what I'm saying but trust me, if you want great seafood skip RL and head to Rodney's oyster house downtown. The lobster is the same price, and done right.  God that meal was gross. Bleh."}
{"text":"Every once in a while, I will make an exception to my rule against reviewing chain restaurants. And every time I make that exception, it's because I received exceptional service.  I'm not a stranger to Red Lobster. I love sea food and it's one of the avenues available to those of us who aren't on the coast every other weekend. And compared to other Red Lobsters I've visited, I prefer the Goodyear location because it's newer and cleaner.  As soon as we arrived, the hostess Maritza made a great impression. She was smiling and sat my girlfriend and I right away. And the service continued with our server, Jarrett. He arrived quickly, took our drink order and explained the menu with his own flair.  I've heard others describe the same menu with less enthusiasm. It sounds weird, but when someone sounds genuinely interested in what they're selling, it makes the dining experience more enjoyable. Which is why I always ask servers about their favorite menu items.  Jarrett was busy with other tables while my girlfriend and I dined on drinks and appetizers mainly. He was always present when needed and did a wonderful job from beginning to end.  Our meal started with great drinks, those always delicious biscuits, and continued with the coconut shrimp. I love the pina colada dipping sauce! But to wrap up the meal, the garlic roasted mussels were a little disappointing. Several of them, nearly 1/4 of them were not opened. Pity. I know if we mentioned it, they probably would've made some more, but we were stuffed.  Even though the food wasn't perfect, there are plenty more options on the menu that I'd love to return for because of the great service. Thanks!"}
{"text":"I've been getting major grief from my wife that we hadn't been to Red Lobster in ages (that's because I'm not a big fan plus I'm driving). So I recently gave in since we had a $10 dollar coupon and it was lent.  Our sever Jen was outstanding, truly a Hall of Fame type server. I only come across this type of server maybe once every year or so. She kept those yummy biscuits and drinks refreshed even before we knew that we needed them refreshed.  I ordered the $19.99 combo of lobster tail and shrimp sewers. The small lobster tail was good but the shrimp were way way (add emphasis on the \"way\") too buttery for my taste. I forgot what my wife ordered, but she enjoyed her meal. See you next time Red Lobster."}
{"text":"Food is absolutely delicious and the staff is very friendly. Our server Nashima was amazing!"}
{"text":"Let's just say 3.5 for what you can expect based on the formula/chain nature of this restaurant. Not bad not bad.  On the weekends you can plan to wait a good while to be seated. This restaurant is enduring and because of the big demand for decent seafood restaurants, of which there are really so few in this area and really most places not on the coasts.  I enjoy starting with some of their cheddar bay biscuits, stuffed mushrooms and clam chowder. What could be better than that. Oh my goodness. Who needs more to eat, but I do.  Oh did I say they have a fair wine list and some decent mixed drinks and martinis too.  When we order a whole Lobster, the servers are very obliging and will do the job of breaking it all apart for you.  Main course I am a Salmon lover if I don't get one of the great combo platters. IN the platter world I am attracted to their shrimp dishes.   Red Lobster has remade themselves many times over and have endured for so many years when so many others have failed and closed.  You can't go wrong if you like some seafood. NO this restaurant is not 4+, but I don't see how you can go wrong with the pleasant tasting seafood means that you really cant get anywhere else around Monroeville.  Weekdays/night you can get in with just a short wait and if you are inclined you can dine at the bar while having a tasty toddy."}
{"text":"I really hate giving a place a bad review, but on this case I had no choice. My wife and I arrived at Red Lobster early to meet friends for dinner. We arrived at 5:50pm. Our friends arrived we talked and now it's 6:11 and no one has come to take our drink order, offer us water, or anything. We had to get the hostess to take our drink order. Finally our waitress arrived. She took our order. We waited for our biscuits. Other tables were being served in a timely manner. When we finally received our orders. I finished my drink and wanted a glass of water. I was never asked if I wanted a refill of my drink. After a while I just wanted the check so we could leave. I know Saturday is a busy day, but still I expect decent service when I am out. I have not plans of ever going to this location again."}
{"text":"Food quantity very small and prices are high. I would not recommend and would not be going back.   Take out customer service below average."}
{"text":"this place used to be one of favs to go have some seafood ,  but this location has really taken a turn for the worst ,   it wil be last time yesterday ,  when we sat down the table was really dirty ,  so i asked the waitress to bring a rag and clean it ,  she got pretty snotty and showed me the rag and said see there's nothing on it ,   then when the glasses of tea were brought out , they look AND FELT filthy  ,   the steak we ordered was greasy , sea food ( lobster and shrimp ) was pretty good ,  but our tip reflected the nasty attitude and filthy table and glasses      GOOD BY RED LOBSTER  .....oh and our bill was 60 bucks for 2 people ,   we will now be going to sedonas grill for lobster and steak , for only 20 bucks each and its much better food ."}
{"text":"On a visit to Arizona, I agreed to eat here after a rave review from my sister about their Bottomless Shrimp deal ($16.99). From my sister's recommendation, my family opted for the Bottomless Shrimp, which includes endless shrimp as well as a salad and a side. You're allowed to pick two different types of shrimp dishes per round. I was surprised by the generous amount of shrimp in each dish. This red lobster is definitely not skimpy with portions. I was also surprised at how tasty the dishes were - definitely not what I was expecting from a chain. My favorite was the Parmesan shrimp but the garlic butter shrimp comes in a close second.   The service, specifically our waitress, was what elevated this dining experience from a typical chain restaurant meal to an enjoyable family outing. Sheree was so accommodating and made us feel completely comfortable and taken care of. I would definitely come back and be sure to request Sheree to be my waitress!"}
{"text":"I had been craving Red Lobster and took the opportunity on this trip. the food was pretty good except my baked potato was under baked. the  service wasn't over the top, not that it was blatantly bad but just not very friendly. overall was just a mediocre experience but with so many choices, I felt like it was a wasted chance to have a great meal at a new restaurant."}
{"text":"I had dinner last night in this location. I love the 4 course menu. The food is yummy, but the service is a little slow, but friendly. I definitely come back."}
{"text":"Okay, sometimes, just sometimes, you have to go to a main stream restaurant and we both felt like seafood last night and didn't want to figure something else out with a cranky baby.  So Red Lobster came up.    We shared the Harberfest with a side of crab legs (man, we love shell fish) and ordered the baby chicken and fries.  The waiter was very good and kept up with us and the baby.  He made sure we had crackers and bisects before anything else.  The food overall was pretty good, the lobster tail was one of the biggest I've gotten at Red Lobster, but appeared to be a bit on the older side since it was tough and the flavor was off.  So needless to say, we left some of that on the plate.  The grilled shrimp, shrimp scampi and crab legs were all great.  As well as the Cesar salad and mashed potatoes.  The baby was quite happy on the starch diet, eating mostly bisects and french fries.  When you just don't want to think a lot about eating out and seafood is on your mind, Red Lobster is a pretty simple and mostly reliable selection."}
{"text":"Went here with the family got the seaside shrimp trio and it was ok at best.  The fried shrimp was ok with the shrimp sauce nothing special.  The garlic shrimp was probably the best feature out of the three options it was nice and buttery and garlicky you can't go wrong.  The pasta and shrimp were too creamy to appreciate anything else.  The highlight of my dinner was half of my husband's lobster tail which was fabulous!!! So overall I gave 3 stars based on my experience."}
{"text":"What a fantastic restaurant. Good food at reasonable prices. I went there on a 'eat all you can crab claws'. I certainly made a meal of it and came out totally full. I notice they are bringing back 'endless shrimps'. Can't wait to get back again.  Service is excellent and cheerful. Very comfortable surroundings. If you are in Toronto, give it a try."}
{"text":"Lauren was our server and she was amazing.  It was great to have such an attentive and friendly server.  She constantly checked to make sure everything was good and she was very personable. Lauren single handily made our visit a tremendous experience.  THANK YOU"}
{"text":"I love having dinner right next to windowsills full of dead flies.   I have been here several times and have always been lucky enough to sit at one of the booths in the center. Before this, my experiences have always been decent. While the food has never been above and beyond, at least service tends to be above average, usually(depending on the waiter, they are usually on top of things and are very friendly and courteous. At least 90% of them are). Nevertheless, I was a little disappointed by these dirty windows. It makes me wonder how cleanly the rest of the restaurant is.   Which really saddens me because we tend to visit here several times a month. Not anymore."}
{"text":"We've been coming to this Red Lobster for almost a year & has always been very clean.  The food has been very good & always comes out fast.   The side portions I think should be a little bigger. More broccoli!  We got the fries for the first time tonight & they weren't anything special. Typical fries, probably won't get them again. Broccoli & mashed potatoes are always good. Service was just a little slower tonight too."}
{"text":"As a creature of habit or maybe a new tradtion, Mom, Grandma and I had dinner here my first night in Phoenix. Yes, Grandma had a coupon and yes, I tipped behind her, but the service and food were good and those cheddar biscuits are still the bomb.   Long live this RL location!"}
{"text":"I went here for all you can eat shrimp. The shrimp was alright, one of the plates I was brought was cold , the biscuits are great. The service was pretty good, we had about a 10 minute wait which wasn't to bad. Over all a average trip."}
{"text":"So far all of my experiences here have been great at this location. Even while they were in construction we've had great service. Bartender is also on point. Drinks are a bit pricer here but again service is consistently good. They have lunch specials years around that are very affordable and compare to eating fast food.    Cheddar bay biscuits are amazing and now available to make at home. I bought some of the mix from Walmart and smiths...so delish!"}
{"text":"My fiance and I wanted lobster and we didn't want to pay an absurd amount to eat it.  So this was perfect!  The lobster pizza appetizer was good."}
{"text":"After years of not eating at Red Lobster, I came here last night, since I had seen a commercial...slowly but surely I remember why I stopped going here.   Service was ok, food was eh...and the prices are high for mediocre food.   Will I be coming back... only if my meal is free. There are a bunch of better seafood places we can go to..."}
{"text":"Oh man the portions are superb!   It's definitely a restaurant to come to with your family, it's kid friendly as well! We ordered a bunch of things on the menu and every single dish was delicious. I loved the shrimp linguine and the grilled shrimp. My favourite was the lobster dip (must try!!!).   Their biscuits (which are free) can be filling so don't eat too much before your food comes or you will be partially full   And if you're ordering alcohol - you MUST try the pina colada!!!!"}
{"text":"When travelling, I prefer eating in locally-owned places.  Plus, you're close to Pittsburgh and a plethora of eating choices that you may not get a chance to visit again...  You can find a Red Lobster just about anywhere. That said, Red Lobster is a favorite of my wife's and when there's one close by, we usually end up eating here. I won't water-down my review but in the effort of saving time, you will be happy to know this Red Lobster is no different than any other.... The Staff is very friendly, prompt and courteous.  The restaurant is clean, very clean.  The food is what you come to expect from RL, Very Good and served hot.  Ours was served within a reasonable amount of time as well. I can go on, but you get the picture.   Red Lobster does what they do very well.  You won't go wrong eating here."}
{"text":"If I could leave a zero star review I would but I simply can't because there is no option. The service was terrible waited 10 minutes to get drinks then had to ask for biscuits Because they didn't even bring them out. Then waited 25 mins for our meals when I ordered them right with the drinks. Barely saw the waiter that was serving us. Should of just walked out when I told my girlfriend I wanted to but she convinced me to stay  BIG MISTAKE FOR DOING THAT. I have been to strongsville and north olmsteds red lobsters and have had great service at the both of them. This one will be last visit here. Horrible service on a slow Saturday night."}
{"text":"Come for the lunch menu - it's the most bang for your buck. Burgers, pastas, etc are only $10 - $15. Good service, good food, amazing biscuits!"}
{"text":"You can easily be forgotten at this place. You have to actually leave your seat and find a water/waitress yourself to get your bill. After you get your bill make sure you go through it carefully, they might accidentally put things you didn't order on your bill!!!"}
{"text":"Longest wait for tables,  nearly 1.5 hrs and slow service and even though we came as a group of 10 (we did requested for 2 tables just incase the wait would be too long and didn't have to wait for a big table) when we came to sat down we noticed there was another empty table next to ours for a group of 5 but they gave it to a couple that came much later than us..."}
{"text":"The only thing that tasted half decent was the calamari and the dragon broccoli... all the entrees were not satisfactory. Especially the Cajun chicken linguini. The chicken that they use in it has a rubber texture. Very gross."}
{"text":"Biscuits. That's why I come here. And I eat a crap load of them.  Delicious."}
{"text":"The start of the evening was rather slow, and we waited about 20 minutes for our drinks initially. However, Natasha made it absolutely AH-MAZ-ING. Truly the best service at a restaurant I have ever experienced in my life!!! Definitely worth the wait. I would recommend this red lobster, and ask for Natasha. Cause she is awesome!!!!"}
{"text":"This location rocks my socks!! Yummy Strawberry Daks, Delicious smoothies, massive portions. It's amazing!!!!  My server (asija -pronounced Asia) was great. Attentive,  knoledgable, and fun  My order: -raspberry smoothie - yummy -stuffed mushroom (appetizer)- sooo good -Shrimp Linguini Alfredo-massive portion, plethora of shrimp, delicious! Garden salad - nice, fresh, and has ranch dressing (mega plus)  Hubby order -strawberry dak -yummy, evenly blended - Seaside Shrimp Trio - popcorn shrimp, grilled shrimp, and shrimp linguini, asparagus (nice crisp and crunchy) and slaw (he didn't say anything about it but it was gone quickly)  Absolutely amazing!! Best date ever :-)"}
{"text":"Finally found a way to get the girls to a seafood restaurant! Have people give us Red Lobster gift cards!!! Wife and daughter does not like seafood, will the wife doesn't! Daughter just copies her on everything!! I, do like seafood! I'm just not able to ever get a chance to eat any! So we just recently ate here, wife had a steak, I ordered the shrimp jambalaya! You have to realize, I may not be a good person to review seafood! Because, I am not able to eat it enough to know whats good and whats bad! I was just happy to be there! Wife did like her steak, and like their dinner rolls a lot. So when ever someone gives us another gift card, we will be back!"}
{"text":"I was with a group of people after a funeral service.  We decided on this restaurant. Unfortunately,  I ordered the calamari and broccoli. It was improperly fried,  the cheese on the fried brocoli was bitter and along with the couple of red peppers on the plate all was soggy with grease. I have to say this is the worst appetizer that anyone coild have dreamed up. It was served lastly, at least six to seven minutes after the others had their coconut shrimp meals. Don't waste your tasebuds on this appetizer."}
{"text":"Went on a Wednesday night after my brother played a concert at the smiths center. The place was extremely dark inside. The food was average, but the service was beyond slow. The place was empty & it took for ever. Maybe she had a bad night. I'm not sure I'll be back."}
{"text":"This restaurant has continued to decline over the past decade. The size of the shrimp and lobster if half the size it used to be, the white fish is bland, the broccoli over seasoned! There are too many quality alternatives. I won't be back!"}
{"text":"I've eaten at a few different Red Lobsters in the valley and for the most part, I am rarely impressed.  The prices tend to be a bit high and the service tends to be only average for average food, in short a three star experience all around.     So the Red Lobster in the Metro Center area was a very pleasant improvement over that experience.   We had a great server who kept up with our needs without being annoying and the food was pretty great.   I ordered the Salmon New Orleans with mashed potatoes and was very impressed.   My one complaint is that the Bloody Mary I ordered must have had an entire bottle of Tabasco sauce in it but other than that, the meal was delicious and the service was excellent.   Other bonuses include more spacious dining areas (we didn't feel cramped even though it was pretty full, as typical for a Red Lobster) and an excellent bar area that had a few TVs with the football game on.   Very nice ambiance in the restaraunt overall.    I will definitely be making the trek out east to eat at this Red Lobster again"}
{"text":"Employees are very friendly and the place is well kept. We had our 1 year old with us and they were very welcoming with our child.   Lobster fest is amazing and the food is always cooked fantastic."}
{"text":"Remarkably pleasant, and consistent, for a chain restaurant. This location is working very hard on quality and service.   Note: the poor reviews for this location are old.  I had blackened salmon tonight. Frankly, it was excellent."}
{"text":"I haven't been to a red lobster in probably 2 years since I'm not a big seafood fan. I do love their biscuits and will come here for that.  They are still delicious. My brother ordered something from the lobsterfest menu and he loved the food and finished the entire thing!  I debated between the steak or chicken linguine. I ordered the steak and was disappointed. Not a lot of taste so I had to use HP sauce. Should have ordered the shrimp linguine but it was 1440 calories and I really wanted tto eat the biscuits. I ate 2.5 biscuits. That's how good they are. Our server Laura was really nice and attentive. Will come back for sure for the biscuits but not the steak."}
{"text":"Ordered food to gk and asked for extra alfredo sauce...server did not tell me that there is a $2.50 extra charge for it. For something they charge for they should give more  than a tsp full...otherwise it should be free"}
{"text":"Great service by the Catherine, our server.  Food is always good but always a bit salty so be prepared to flush out later."}
{"text":"Excellent all around!! Stuffed flounder was superb. Waiter jay attentive and polite. We will return."}
{"text":"If you wanted to find a new seafood place, this place is for you! The food is very delicious and at a reasonable price. Everytime when I eat here, I always have left overs. They also have these butter biscuits that are a must have. The service here is great. Would recommend me friends and family here."}
{"text":"Endless Shrimp cannot be beat. The real key to this promotion is good service and that is just what we got from.Kelle and she took good care of us, she had our refills timed just right, I never waited for anything once we started.  The only bad thing about endless shrimp is that it is only once an year.  A Big THANK YOU to Red Lobster at Superstition Spring in Mesa, AZ and to Kelle for the best meal, that I have had in a long time.    Good Job."}
{"text":"The recent remodel of this Red Lobster really improved the physical appearance. Less nautical and more upscale and classy. The portions of tonight's dinner were larger than prior visits (enough for two meals). The food was very good. We went with our usual crab alfredo. It is no longer on the printed menu, but is still an online order option and is available in the restaurant if you request it. The servers were prompt and friendly."}
{"text":"Wow. Where do I begin?    1st time ever at Red Lobster: walking in, live lobsters, fresh. very nice.   We were seated and the waiter was very courteous and introduced me to a new favourite mixed drink: Malibu Hurricane (the only thing is is that I did ask before hand if they had jagermeister and goldschlager and he said they didn't have any jager.. and when I was walking out I saw that they had them both sitting right beside eachother at the bar...) Other than that we felt comfortable and he offered my mom a nice wine that I did enjoy.  The food was delicious. I love how they have the seafood fest menu that changes every so often and the food really looks like as per picture. which is nice; you don't get that alot with other restaurants.  No complaints there! DELISH. (lobster and shrimp.. amazing!)  Now, when we got to our car, I don't have any idea how it began but basically a BIC lighter exploded in between the drivers seat and the gear shifting unit and a fire had sparked; one of the female managers (not sure who) was very helpful in helping me get water as I was running back and forth to get it so that our car didn't explode or fully catch fire. (VERY SCARY EXPERIENCE!!!) Another manager came on the scene to see if we were ok, i'm so glad that we got the help we needed and the fire was extinguished.   So in summary (because I don't usually write this lo0o0ng...) but the food was amazing, and the people were truly helpful in a great time of need."}
{"text":"Food is yummy, but I find that in general you have to order one of the more pricey dishes in order to get the best that the restaurant has to offer.  Mmm... Lobster.   Last time I dined there, it wasn't very busy, but the service was somewhat slow.  Very odd.   A little devastated as to the fact that they no longer sell crab cakes or biscuits anymore. Not sure if this includes all locations, bit it is indeed quite disappointing."}
{"text":"We had great service! Our waitress was so sweet to play along with my daughter and bring extra straws and plates for her stuffed animal. The fish tacos were delicious, but messy! Get extra napkins. I loved the more nutritious side dishes offered for the kids: broccoli, orange slices, side salad. My husband had fish and chips and enjoyed it. It was crisp and flaky!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for good seafood, Red Lobster is not your place. I've been here 3 times in about 2 years and all three times the food was not good and neither was the service. The last time was about a month ago when I was craving some good ol' fish and chips and didn't want to drive to our favorite pub in Legacy Village, Claddaugh.  My sad dish came with previously frozen fries and previously frozen fish. It definitely did NOT look hand-battered. The fish itself was so dry, I had to drown it in tartar sauce and the flavor itself was not good at all. The salads that came with our meal was wilted iceberg lettuce that tasted like it was made either the day before or that morning. We had to ask our server for refills on drinks, and that was when we caught her walking by which wasn't often. We also had to ask for a refill of cheddar biscuits and she actually gave us a look of disgust at our wanting more. Sadly, those biscuits were the best part of our meal. I've never been happy with the food here, I've had much better seafood at other restaurants. Not only that, but the prices are high for the quality of food they serve. I'm always so confused when I see a full restaurant and parking lot at the Mentor location. I'm guessing people just don't know any better. If you want good seafood in the area, your best bet is Pickle Bills in Grand River.   I won't be back at Red Lobster."}
{"text":"Not that great. Expensive. Told em that I didn't want frozen shit and they admitted that their lobster was frozen. So I had something else. Was expecting some fancy shit but it was more family style than anything."}
{"text":"Please check your eating utensils before eating at this restaurant I am highly shocked the manager was helpful he did give me my food free but I can only imagine how many people use their fork or their spoon and did not realize how nasty it could be"}
{"text":"I sometimes just wonder, how do places like this keep going?  Really!  I used to go to their locations in New York and Washington DC, and I so looked forward to a continuance of excellent goodies here in the hotbed of culinary delights.   Bluntly, the only thing I can say good about this place is the service.  But if they bring garbage to your table in a prompt and courteous manner, what good is that?  The manager came to the table asking for a critique of the food and quite frankly I was too polite to tell her what I really thought.  The fried clams:  is there really some kind of seafood inside that almost burnt batter? For some strange reason, maybe it is a cultural thing, they do a good business but the food really sucks."}
{"text":"Went there once and they were OUT OF FISH! Not joking, all they had was crab, lobster and shrimp, zero fish. Which meant there was no ordering without spending an arm and a leg."}
{"text":"Ok so I called to place a to go order and Lilly literally had me on hold for 15 minutes and then I hung up, called back and she had me on hold for another 10 minutes! Crazy, then I pulled up and walked in and no one there, it was not busy at all! I just think that's terrible customer service!"}
{"text":"This place is my boyfriends favorite !! He always has the choose any 3 with the shrimp linguini, 7 oz pepper steak and the coconut shrimp! He cannot get enough of this place ! I always get shrimp scampi, waltz shrimp and clam strip! YUMMMM! never disappointed. although I wish the prices weren't so hight the service is great and food is amazing ! Afterwards some cheesecake . it was not too bad but not the best ! DEFINITELY worth a try :)"}
{"text":"A few friends and I decided we wanted to grab a late bite. This location closes at 10, and we were those guys that cruised in at 9:50. We all have worked in the industry at some point so we know how disheartening it can be, but we were planning on just being in and out.   Our server, Jeremy, did a great job. He was on point with refills, cheese bread refills, and pre-bussing. He was courteous and attentive, especially for it being that late at night. We ran a $90 tab and left 20%, so I'm sure he ended up being cool with it.  I ordered the Lobster, Scallops, and grilled shrimp combo platter and it was delicious. I got rice and broccoli with it, and added a Caesar salad, and a lobster bruschetta to start. Everything but the broccoli was good. The grilled lobster tail was tasty, and while the texture of the scallops seemed overcooked, I was still delighted with the flavor.   It was a good dining experience all around. In at 9:50 and out by 10:30 with no rush on the restaurants part. Appetizer, salad, entree, and then time to eat. Our server timed our experience perfectly and made for a great late night dining endeavor."}
{"text":"Ok so the wait wasn't all that bad but the area where they had seated us was freezing cold on where I wished I had brought my jacket! Lol but it kinda made up when they brought out their biscuits. I sure miss those! My daughter had rcvd a gift card, that's why we chose here to eat tonite. Although I kinda ate before coming here so I ordered the seaside sampler because it had all what I wanted. But since I was freezing, they get 3stars from me. The server was bubbly & sweet. But I guess next time I would bring a jacket & order up some liquor to keep me warm & satisfied. Typical red lobster, it is what it is I guess. Still loves ya! Lol Thanks & catch ya on the flip side! Smooches"}
{"text":"I tried to place a to go order tonight at 7:30pm.  A female answered and placed me on hold for more than 5 minutes.  Needless to say, I went hungry after hanging up, giving up."}
{"text":"The rating is confusing because I saw nothing wrong with anything here. We were asked if we were celebrating and we told them we had a couple celebrations a few days ago and they still came out with ice cream on the house.  The restroom was clean , the table was clean , the hostess was quick and polite and the wait staff was outstanding. The food was good too."}
{"text":"I went here with my mother for lunch because she likes it.  My mother had the lunch shrimp scampi which is what she always gets and I had the lunch sailor's platter.  All of the food (salads, biscuits, entrée, vegetables)  was good, not great and obviously microwaved.  Our waitress was Jade, again good but not great.  Spent most of my meal thinking of how I could have gotten four times the quantity of better quality food for half of the price over at Fuji's."}
{"text":"We went to Red Lobster for lunch just after 2 PM.  It was moderately busy but we were quickly seated.  All three of us had the Endless Shrimp and between us, we had most of the varieties.  All were good, but nothing spectacular.  Service was not exactly speedy, but wasn't slow enough to put me off either.  Everyone was extremely courteous and pleasant.  $57.00 for three lunch specials was more than I am used to paying in a town known for inexpensive food, but it wasn't unexpected.  All-in-all, just as the rating says \"A-OK\"."}
{"text":"Our waiter was so sweet. He did a great job. But the food was so gross!! Red lobster is not the same anymore and over priced. Poor quality food.The manager did come to talk to us about the food. We let him know that our food wasn't tasting like usual. He offered us a different plate but we declined. We just wont be back."}
{"text":"Pardon my unoriginal choice of dinner spot while driving through Pittsburgh, but the garlic cheese biscuits at Red Lobster beckoned me and I gladly obliged. After my fourth biscuit, it was a completely different story, seeing how my recommended upper limit of sodium and fat intake could have easily been reached by consuming one biscuit alone.  My Maui Luau shrimp and salmon were juicy and topped with the right amount of sweet and tangy sauce, with a hint of spiciness. My parents ordered the broiled seafood platter and the fried seafood platter. As much as I hate to stereotype, it's easy to guess who ordered what. Surprisingly, my mom's broiled platter was not as healthful as it sounded on paper. Aside from the scallops, the garlic shrimp scampi and the stuffed flounder were just as calorific (if not more) than my dad's fried platter which consisted of fried fish, crab cakes, popcorn shrimp, and clam strips.  This particular RL looked and smelled like the other RLs found across the states. You've got your healthy eaters picking away at salads and you've got your gluttons happily stuffing their faces with, not one, but two fried platters. Okay, so perhaps my inhaling four of those trans-fat ladened biscuits and finishing off my plate wasn't so bad afterall. Either way, RL is a chain I'll frequent from time to time due to its ever-changing menu and its tasty creations. Oh, and those goddamn delicious biscuits too!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here on a Tuesday night at 8:30 pm. They told us the wait would be at least 15 minutes... Just looking in we saw 6 dirty tables and the whole 22 minutes they made us wait no one cleaned any of the tables. It's always such mixed reviews when I come here. I have great food and my service was awful or vise versa. I don't think it's worth spending 60$ for 2 to have an ok experience."}
{"text":"The free cheese biscuits were good and the cocktail selection is good. Had the fresh oysters and they were horrible. I seriously couldn't eat them as they were like rubber. The waiter asked how they were and I was nice but told him they were basically inedible (I tried 3 of the 12 and gave up). He whisked them away, but I could tell he was annoyed. Anyway we ordered our food and I had garlic shrimp skewers with the new pecan sweet potatoes, and my friend ordered a steak medium rare. When we asked how much longer our food would take (It was over 45 mins since we ordered) our waiter snapped \"you ordered medium well! I can't control how long it take for meat to cook! I was floored. I was very polite when I asked and the jerk never came to check on us in well over 30 mins. All he had to say was \"let me check\". Whatever, he seemed over worked and really stressed. Anyway when the food came the shrimp had no taste and no garlic and came on a bed of rice that was seriously like two tablespoons. Pecan sweet potatoes were way way too sweet, I couldn't finished them. My friend said he food was good but not great. Over all, not the best experience and I wont be back."}
{"text":"20 years been going to this place it was such a nice place now it is a rundown dump. fighting in the parking lot. screaming with loud conversations with customers and staff it is just turn into a dump a total dump. Maybe that's part of the reason the food taste so bad now, environment."}
{"text":"Tonight was one of the best restaurant experiences I have had in my entire life.  I took my wife out for a date night here, and when we arrived, they said it would be about a 45 minute wait for a booth, but it ended up only being 20-25 minutes instead, so that was a plus.  Brittany was our waitress (if you come here, ask for her), and she was very nice and extremely attentive, but wasn't at all pushy or invasive, like some servers tend to be.  She was very informative and knowledgeable on what menu items they had on special, as we'll as the 'Fresh Catch' menu, and was able to answer any questions I had (you might say I'm the problem customer; I like to know everything I can before making a decision), and was extremely patient with me as well.  Virtually anywhere my wife and i go, we order a larger meal and split it, as neither of us can really manage a full portion on our own, and i think some waiters or waitresses put us on the back burner because of it, sort of setting us in a corner and trying to forget about us, since they believe we won't tip very decently.  Well Brittany was absolutely lovely, and treated us worth exactly the same care as the party of ten she was serving a few tables away, and for that she truly earned her tip. (=  On to the food:   We decided to go with the 'pick any three' appetizers, and so we got: fried clam strips, fried calamari and vegetables, and mozzarella sticks For our meal: The Ultimate Feast (caesar salad, fried shrimp, shrimp scampi, lobster tail and snow crab legs) And, of course, an extra helping of Snow crab legs. The meal was quite appetizing, and absolutely everything (minus the shrimp scampi, which was about 8/10, for which Brittany apologized profusely, and she shouldn't have done this, but she knocked a sizeable bit off the bill) was top notch! Served with flair, and every bite filled with more flavor than it should sensibly be capable of containing. I also got to try fried broccoli for the first time, and it was good enough, I think I'll go home and try to copy it, and if I fail, I'll just come back here and eat again =P  5/5 Stars, as long as you ask for Brittany as your server!!!"}
{"text":"I love seafood. And being away from the ocean, Red Lobster is where i go to get my crab, shrimp, lobster fix.  service was slower than normal because it was busy. Had to wait about 30 minutes to get seated.   Food to me was good. I ordered the ultimate feast."}
{"text":"HYPE HYPE HYPE WHITE PEOPLE HYPE  That's all I knew about Red Lobster before going in. My friends have been talking about going to this place for agggggggges (they're really susceptible to marketing lol) so finally last week, we decided to go.  We got there around 7 on a Friday night, and this place was empty! There was like one other table there.   The first thing we noticed was the lobster tank...now I've seen lobster tanks before, but never have I seen a tank where they looked soo...unhappy.  Anyways, I look through the menu and saw that they had a 18.99 4 course feast...and I was like DAMN LETS DO IT!   So here's what we got:  1. Chicken Tortilla Soup  - actually really good. Nice broth with LOTS of chicken and tortilla pieces. Totes warmed me up after coming in from ICE CUBE NATION.  2. Ceasar Salads - Standard fare, just parm, lettuce and croutons. No lemon on the side, but whatevs.  3. Spicy Habanero Coconut Shrimp Bites and Sweet Citrus-Grilled Shrimp (yea i just copied that from their menu) - I swapped out the rice for fries. The bites were SUUUUUUUUUPER sweet, and not my favourite. Tiny too. The Grilled Shrimp Skewer was mad overdone, and no hint of citrus at all. The coleslaw was super great though.  4. The Cheese-Crusted Tilapia - my friend henna got this. It looked like a small piece of fish hidden under a huge ass pile of tempura bits or something, served with brocolli. The brocs was good, the fish had no flavour whatsoever, and it was super over done + dry. Soz.  5. The Ultimate Surf and Turf (Lobsterfest special) - My 2nd friend Umair got this. This looked beautiful. A sirloin steak smothered in a lobster hollondaise with a lobster tail with a greenish cheesy sauce on it with mash. The steak was okay (my friend got it medium well, so its not their fault) The lobster on the steak was relaly really bad. It was super chewy, and it was like the worst bits that you get from the claws and the body. My friend pushed all that to the side. Even I didn't eat it. The lobster tail was super overdone too, and so hard to remove from the shell. The sauce on top was great though.  6. Shrimp Tuesdays - Garlic Shrimp, Handbreaded Shrimp, and Shrimp Linguine -My third friend got this. The garlic shrimp were swimming in some sort of watery-butter liquid. Not appetizing at all. The Handbreaded shrimp was yummy though. The Shrimp Linguini was just alfredo with some tiny shrimps on top. Super dissapointing.  7. The Key Lime Pie - I got this, and it was pretty delicious, standard fare though. Looks like it was premade.   8. The cookie-molten-pie thing. A huge ass cookie that spews chocolate when cracked into, with a scoop of vanilla. I was too full to try this, ut my friends say it was burnt or something. Looked yummy though.  Notes:  So the 4 course feast was not the est, but it was certainly a good deal.  The portion sizes here are huge for everything though. We ALL had leftovers, and we're all huuuuuuuuuge eaters. Well except Henna. She's tiny.  I did think all the other items were suuuuuuuuuper expensive, and not really worth it.  For tthe 4 of us, it came to 150 + tip, so yea  Pros wont be back here, it's too plain for my liking."}
{"text":"I hardly ever come here, however tonight the food was deliciously fresh and hot. I had the wood grilled lobster and red shrimp....so so yummy! The cheddar and garlic biscuits were worm and cooked with just enough softness and crispiness. Julia the server was amazingly nice and went above and beyond for the table. If I go again anytime soon, I will be requesting her as my server."}
{"text":"I can't say anything bad about this restaurant. 1) i love LOVE seafood, 2) i used to work for this chain - yes i was the bestest biscuit girl 3) my post root-canel lobster bisque made everything better 4) my wedding dinner was in a redlobster.  so here we go: it's endless shrimp season for 19.99!!  friday dinner plan + endless shrimp = happy camper. Too bad we only had four different shrimp dishes to pick from. the wasabi grilled shrimp was new - i tried it but it's more like terriyaki sauce and a bit too sweet for my pallete. And shrimp alfredo had only teeny tiny baby shrimps... so naturally i was sticking to the garlic shrimp and hand breaded shrimp. Both are sooooo good. I had plates upon plates of those. won't eat another shrimp for a long time i think.   salad was very salty, buns were fresh, red skin potato was flavorless, but shrimp made everything better!  i love red lobster"}
{"text":"The service was great, the food delicious and plentiful. I had a few special requests and they honored every one of them. I really enjoyed this experience!!!"}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with Red Lobster ! The shrimp lettuce wraps are awesome ! Love the jumbo coconut shrimp!  I like to go when they have promotions like lobster fest , endless shrimp Ect ... The shrimp linguini is so awesome !"}
{"text":"2/10/2016 waited 30 minutes to be seated. Still pretty unclear being it was a Wednesday. Our server, Gabrielle was OK but obviously ready to go home. Her personality was tired, exhausted yet forcing herself to get through the shift. She took our orders, drinks as well. She brought me my drink, minus the straw. Said she'd be back with it, never returned with one. This happened 3x's. We nebrr received our buscuits because they were cooking. We finally got them AFTER the meal. When she brought our food, my 15 yr Olds meal  (chicken strips with fries) was cold and obviously off the children's menu. My daughter is 6'1, far from a toddler so 2 tiny strips with a handful of French fried did not cut it!"}
{"text":"The flavor was actually good it was just over cooked. I've pictured the worst of the fish. The service was excellent and they discounted our bill."}
{"text":"Ok so I've been here many times but today they rocked. My friend and I sat at the bar and the service is so off the chain I stopped eating to write this!  My food is hot and everything tastes great!"}
{"text":"This is the only location in Las Vegas that I have visited (since moving here in 1992), and that's because of a spectacular General Manager I met there, several years ago.  My ex-wife and I were in there one day, and as I was using the restroom, I observed a Bartender enter, relieve himself, then exit without washing his hands.  After returning to my table, I asked my server to summon the General Manager to our table, which she did, immediately.  When she arrived, I explained what I had seen and how I was \"grossed out\" by what I'd witnessed.  After apologizing, she excused herself and told us, \"I'll be right back.\"  A few minutes later she returned to our table and said, \"I just fired him, and your meal is on me.\"  When I mentioned that he should not be fired ONLY on my single complaint, she replied, \"This isn't the first time that I've heard about it, but it is now the LAST.  Please enjoy your meal as my guest, and accept my apology for what happened.\"  That kind of attitude is indeed rare, and it left a lasting impression on me, which is why I eat here, as often as I can.  I've eaten at other Red Lobsters in the USA, but NONE BETTER than at this splendid location."}
{"text":"SENSATIONAL, but NOT because of the food.  The reason I will be returning (and the reason for the 5 stars) are these:  1. Victoria (Greeter) 2. Brandan Weisenberger (Manager) 3. Linda (Server)  Yes, the food quality is indeed terrific, and the prices are reasonable, but to me, THE PEOPLE are what make this place stand out, and THEY are why I will be back, as often as possible.  Good people = A good experience, and the super-friendly staff are a wonderful reflection on management.  This location is NOT the closest one to where I live, but you can bet that it will be my PREFERRED location.  When you go there, ask for LINDA to be your server.  She's phenomenal!"}
{"text":"Today was great experience at this location. The food was fresh and and the waitress was very friendly."}
{"text":"This place is only good if you have that seafood craving. Other than that is just not worth the money and sometimes the wait. The food is decent but it's just not living up to the hype. It's just sad how a huge chain could turn into a Seafood Applebee's"}
{"text":"Lunch stuffed flounder very good... but house salad... if I had to pay extra which I didn't, I would be disappointed ! Like eating bagged lettuce with 2 grape size... smaller than grape... tomato!!! I did not have croutons left them off.  Yes my salad was a big disappointment! Like I said I have the stuffed flounder with wild rice and it was excellent."}
{"text":"We had Denny tonight. He was super attentive this evening. I do apologize about my grandfather he was a little on edge about your forgetting his plate. Other than that my grandparents enjoyed their food. My steak was kind of bland but hey it's not a steakhouse so I can't expect much. The tea ooohhh the chamomile tea had the flavor of Ajax dish washing liquid. I don't know if that was a bonus but I won't do that  again. Great service ok food but Denny was A1."}
{"text":"Lets start with this: I am addicted to sea food... and I mean - I eat it at least few times a week. We finally visited Red Lobster, and We tried soo many shrimp dishes..  The shrimps come from the cheapest quality & smallest in size of those frozen bags!!! So, they do taste like frozen shrimps (Baaaaad)....   At the entrance, you can see live lobsters, which gives you the impression that you are in for a fresh sea food experience.... Noooo... they prove you wrong after just few minutes. On top of that, me and my gf both felt bad later at night - as if we were getting mild symptoms of poisoning... not severe ones - nothing soo serious - but just mild... Barely annoying....  The decoration and setting of the place is nice... but ---not coming back...."}
{"text":"Red Lobster has apparently  lost all standards for food quality and cleanliness.....I understand that we were there for all you can eat shrimp however I wasn't expecting the food to be of such  poor quality....The scampi, parmesan and teriyaki shrimp were all very bland and watery tasting...very old frozen shrimp?...The fried was not much better and  the alfredo sauce for the pasta tastes exactly like it came from a can, which it does....While waiting for our meal I noticed an incredible amount of dust on the woodwork and lighting surrounding our booth....visible on my finger when run across the dust....the floors unvacuumed, windows extremely smudged and dirty, and the foyer, which is your first impression when entering was an unkempt disaster. The bathroom (ladies) greeted me with an unflushed bowl (not the nicer kind), toilet paper on the floor and just an overall gas station feel to it....I worked for RL about 6 years ago and these standards would have never been accepted....What happened to \"Flashlight Clean\"?????????? Perhaps management should revisit this concept in order to improve the guests experience? The only highlight of the evening was our server who was prompt, polite and courteous... She approached our table with a smile and we were pleased with her service."}
{"text":"I had 6 oysters that were very plump but honestly they tasted like nothing. We shared a Cesar salad that was excellent then dinner was 2 Maine lobster tails with mashed potatoes. The lobster was cooked perfectly & the potatoes were creamy & delicious. I had 2 biscuits & couldn't eat my whole dinner. I gave my lobster to my fiancé to finish. Our waitress was very good too. Had a good meal as everything was hot in temperature. Would come again."}
{"text":"Wow, they really hustle at this place!    We came here on a busy Friday night during dinnertime rush.  We were quoted a 45 minute wait but it ended up being closer to 20.  Seeing as we'd already perused the menu and decided what we wanted, the server took our order right away.  Not even 10 minutes later, we were served.  The bussers continued to bring us out warm bread, even after we had our meals in front of us.    Our server was very sweet, and was sure to stop by often to see if we needed anything throughout our meal.  All the staff members were scurrying around like busy little bees, yet every single one of them was friendly and cheerfully helpful.  When it came time to box up our leftovers, our server took it upon herself to do it for us (not that we would've minded doing it ourselves), and she even put the entire basket of bread in there without us mentioning one word about it.  That was one of those nice little \"extras.\"    The food was typical Red Lobster food, I'm guessing if you've been to one, you've been to all.  But we're always surprised by how much food you actually get.  Definitely didn't leave hungry, that's for sure!    Our experience here was a great one, we'd go back for sure."}
{"text":"Not sure what was happening the time we came in, but we walked in and saw about 5-6 servers hovered together at the host desk. One server stormed out; he was noticeably frustrated about something. Anyway, the excitement dissipated after a few seconds. Right afterwards, the servers dispersed, no greeting at the door when we walked in. When we finally were able to talk to someone, she asked us if it's okay to be seated at a booth/table, but we preferred a booth instead. She said she didn't have any other ones, but we came in around 9pm. There was a lot of empty booths to the left of the bar.  She said there wasn't any servers working there. However, after a few arrangements, they were able to get us a booth.   Our server Shaun was exceptional. He really worked hard and was rather pleasant to deal with considering the past few minutes we experienced when we walked through the door were really uncomfortable.   I ordered the bar harbor lobster bake. The sauce tasted like water, oil, and lemon. Not at all what I expected for a $30 meal. The lobster was also over cooked and chewy. The manager had the meal removed off the check so that was quickly solved. Everything else like the stuffed mushrooms, crab linguini tasted like it should."}
{"text":"I have always liked red lobster.  Today food was still good but the service was terrible ! I sat at the bar.  Dirty. Had to ask to get it cleaned. Had to ask for napkins. Never got any silverware either.  Had to ask if my food was ready.  After receiving it she disappeared.    Never came back thru the whole meal to ask if things were good or if I needed anything.   I used to do this for a living.   I hope I never have her again if I should sit in bar area.  She has a lot to learn about customer service"}
{"text":"Very bad service,long wait,restrooms were awful,workers was complaining because they had to clean restrooms and they worked in the kitchen because dishwashers walked off the job. We had to flag down servers to order,they had attitudes it was just an awful experience for a 4 year old and a 13 year old. My grand baby asked me why the server act like that,very bad when a baby ask"}
{"text":"It's honestly just like any other red lobster. It's good for chain restaurant seafood. The live lobster is always extremely good. The drinks are good. Amazing selection of drinks. The staff is nice, I haven't met a rude water yet."}
{"text":"Tonight, hubby and I celebrated our cotton year (second) anniversary at Red Lobster. And this was my third time going to any Red Lobster. Anyway, we had been craving seafood and decided to make it happen today. We told the server, Kayla, it was our special day and she seemed genuinely interested.  I mean she asked if we were celebrating anything special? So, I'm thinking \"free dessert\" or something-- oh no, just the words happy anniversary written on our overpriced check!  The place was nearly empty when we walked in at 4 PM but our server was apologetic every time she came back to our table because she was always gone too long.  Other than that, the food and drinks sure did make our bellies smile.  Snow grabs: $18.99 Dual Lobster Tails: $28.99 Sangria \"Juice\": ? Bahama Mama: ?  Lesson on eating out on our big day: Pricey;-)"}
{"text":"Red Lobsters will always remain on my low budget seafood places because it's just the quality! Once you eat at 5 star seafood restaurants like Mastros Ocean Club, and then eat at red lobsters then you will understand where I'm coming from! Not to come off snobby or anything but bottom line I just don't ever have great experiences here! My mom for whatever reason loved Red Lobsters and selected this location for her birthday lunch! First hiccup was the Caesar salad that came out with the wilted lettuce, Second was the steak that I ordered with the whole surf and turf new dish my waiter recommended. The steak was ordered medium and came out WELL and dry, Third I asked for cheese on my baked potato and it came out with three strings of cheese? Smh don't believe me look T the pics attached! Management got involved and addressed my concerns accordingly hut geeze it was a train wreck. This experience validated my initial issues I stated in the beginning and is the reason I don't come here."}
{"text":"Somehow I got talked into coming here and even from the beginning I just knew it would up to my standards when it comes to seafood! Let's be honest here the quality of red lobster food has most definitely declined over the years! I remember as a kid ig was such a big deal if you and your family got to eat out at red lobsters lol or even if somebody brought you on a date here.. Now it's just like Red Lobsters? O_o anyways on to my just okay dining experience walked in asked for a table for two.. Specifically requested a booth.. Waited about 15 mins they were starting to pick up. Seated accordingly. Our waitress who I'm going to opt not to put on blast was just so so. Not sure if we caught her on a bad day but literally everything we asked her she would reply \"yes but it's going to be minute\" it got to the point when we were like umm okay we understand honey you don't have to disclose that on every request and she said it a bit condescending which made things even worse. The biscuits were probably the best part of the meal. The endless shrimp thing that they make such a huge deal about is over rated and I feel like I could've made these oven baked shrimps at home. Check the pics I post so you can see how the quality is mediocre. Long John silvers might've delivered a bit better than they did on this trip! Once you reach a certain expectation of food and know what good quality seafood taste like red lobsters will be obsolete.. Hmmph guess I'm just spoiled. Oh well won't be returning! Yall can keep the bad service and Van Kemp frozen food quality food!"}
{"text":"So living here in las vegas i have pretty much been to all of the red lobster's in town and i would have to say that this location in Henderson has to be the best one! From the service to the food all across the board! They have the nicest waitress i forget her name she is a cute little asian lady and i seriously come here just because of her! Stays on top of everything! And check's in all the time to make sure that the food and service is good as well. Just visited here recently right before the lobster fest was over and had another great visit! Keep up the good work you guys!"}
{"text":"Not usually a chain person but we make an exception for this place. The service is absolutely amazing every time I come and they make sure to get your order right.   My boyfriend and I come by about every other month and sit at the bar. Every time we come the service is great from the bartenders to the waitresses who are stopping by the bar to pick up drinks."}
{"text":"Visit the area often and I like Red Lobster's fresh fish. The Concord Mills location NEVER has enough wait staff. Half the tables in the restaurant are open but the lobby is full of waiting customers. It is like this almost every time I visit. And it's 6:30pm so not right at 5pm. They have had plenty of time to get wait staff in place for the night. Giving up on this location- Bone Fish Grill is right down the street!"}
{"text":"Enjoying birthday dinner with our son tonight. Our server was nice and kept up on our needs. Only minor things I would mention is that for only ordering crab legs bring butter and shell cracker out with (or before) the order. Other than that, it was a great experience."}
{"text":"I have been going to This Red Lobster for many years. I have always had great food and great service. Last night was a very unusual night and we had some delays coming out of the kitchen. The manager came to check on us and was very apologetic and offered us a free desert. It is hard to always be perfect but they do a great job and as always the food was great."}
{"text":"I'm going with 2 stars because I like the biscuit.  And the service was good.  But I feel like I just ate a 20 dollar plate of McDonald's. Meaning how many chemicals did I consume over the course of the meal.  It could be my nutty mind but that's how I felt.  And I don't remember reading or seeing Ads claiming the food is healthy or all natural."}
{"text":"This is what happens when I attempted to dine with my mother and both her sisters.  Mom wants Chinese, but Aunt #1 is on Atkins for the upteenth time and that's the one cuisine she finds difficult to work around.  Aunt #2 wants only \"American\" food.  So I foolishly suggest plenty of non-chain options, only to get them all rejected by either mom or Aunt #2.  So after at least 45 minutes of this nonsense, we end up at Red Lobster.  Not the best Red Lobster, but certainly not the worst.  Since Caesar salad is always overdressed, I made the mistake of ordering the dressing on the side not realizing I would need to utilize a butter knife to get any on the lettuce.  The scallops on the broiled seafood platter were somewhat bland, and my mom's grilled shrimp had absolutely no color to them.  They looked like boiled shrimp that somehow skewered themselves.  But other than that, everything was as expected.  Except the part at the end of the meal where Aunt #2 remarks \"I guess if you lived in the area, it would be fine to try somewhere local.\"  Uh, I do, and we had this conversation before we ever left my house."}
{"text":"I wish my dining experience was better. Our sever was friendly but every unattractive she walked past our table many time with stopping and asking if everything was okay. We sat waiting for boxes and check for ever and had to wave her down before she noticed us. Overall I had higher expectations."}
{"text":"I went here for dinner on Friday night with the hubby and was really happy. we had to wait 25 mins for a table as you are not allowed to make reservations and it was pretty  spot on with timing. We mainly came here for the endless shrimp for myself and my husband wanted crab legs. service was really good and attentive. since we joined the red lobster club we were also able to have a free appetizer.  The appetizer we went for was the calamari and mushrooms. the calamari was quite salty and also the complimentary biscuits were salty too.  The endless shrimp works where you order 2 of the 5 options and they come back to you to see if you want more. I see why they do it so ppl don't overdo it but they were very good in coming back regularly to check up on me. I personally couldn't do too much for the deep fried ones but I loved the Korean shrimp.  My husband loved his crab legs and our sides we got too. the Brussel sprouts and potatoes and I loved my whipped sweet potatoes with pecans!  will definitely go back again ... hopefully by that time another deal comes around."}
{"text":"We had visited this location this evening, and everything was so delicious and very fresh and flavor full also our server Daniea was very friendly and courteous happy to serve. I have been this location serval time and never disappointed. My brother who came from india he has first visit and he really impress with quality of food and flavor he feel in food he will keep coming to this location.  Recommend mouth watering dishes 'Roasted Maine Lobster Bake' and 'Garlic Grilled Shrimp' for Healthy Option."}
{"text":"Slow slow slow.  This is my first time ever in life not leaving a tip.  I had to beg my waiter for the cheddar bay biscuits and had to wait forever for my meal and my check.  One star for poor customer service.  The food was average."}
{"text":"This place is very cleans and the employees are very nice. We didn't wait long at all, I love that! My kids also enjoyed it. Family friendly place that I would definitely recommend!  I order the new seafood feast on special and I could tell you that it was wonderful! I will be coming back soon."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible! Don't do it! My girlfriend and her family went to this location got horribly sick. I forgot she told me got a gift card for Christmas came to location and the lettuces were wilted and my girlfriend was nauseous throwing up and horribly sick yet again! This location needs to be closed down!"}
{"text":"I have not been to Red Lobster since the late 1980's and was really expecting low quality pre-cooked microwaved heated food. To my surprize the food was actually quite high quality, cooked and seasoned well if not a bit too salty. My wife, daughter and I had the triple seafood dish which consisted of salmon, shirmp and lobster tail. My son had a large combo consisting of steak, lobster tail, shrimp and snow crab legs. I did not find the cheese biscuits that great but everyone else seemed to rave about it. I never really like buiscuits though as I find them too dry for my taste. I ordered a sunset pina coloda which was just okay and not overpriced. We had stuffed mushrooms as and appetizer. The bill for the four of use came to $170 not including taxes which I felt was kinda steep but I was okay with it because I enjoyed the meal, thought it was high quality and our waiter and service was great. We went early though and the place was mostly empty 5pm on a Friday."}
{"text":"My family and I had never been to Red Lobster before. We thought it would be exciting to try because it's \"so American\" and its marketing is ubiquitous. And, as a bonus, when we walked in, we noticed that every single patron was morbidly obese. I took this as a sign that the food must be irresistibly delicious.   After this experience, I will never use those three criteria for selecting a restaurant. The food was one of the worst I've ever had in my life. It tasted like butter, not seafood. Everything was dripping with butter. It was so salty and buttery we felt queasy. My family and I were just... It was so bad we laughed and were like \"wtf lol\" and vowed never to come back. We were so surprised that such an apparently popular restaurant could be so bad. Over the years, I've learned that this kind of poor quality is common at American chain restaurants. Such a sad waste of money. I fell for the marketing. Now I know better."}
{"text":"I always love the service and food.  Coconut shrimp is by far my favorite. We usually do the three choices of two coconut shrimp and shrimp Alfredo with a side of mashed potatoes. Drinks are good as well. Clean and professional."}
{"text":"We've been going to RL for about 20 years and have noticed subtle changes since change of ownership but this is a new one. Last eve 4 of us went arriving before the crowd at 5 pm. The place looked like a furniture store with less than half the tables occupied. The girl at the desk told us we would have to wait 10 or 15 minutes before we could get a seat as all the wait staff was busy. It seemed very odd since we could plainly see this was not true. A couple came in after us and was told the same thing so they went to the bar and ordered drinks. It then dawned on me that this is their new scam by telling people they'd have to wait and directing them to the bar to sell them drinks. After 10 minutes of seeing this, we told the girl at the desk we were leaving. She then told us that our table was now ready but we declined and left. It felt like an insult to our intelligence and we decided never to return."}
{"text":"Went here last night with my girlfriend..lets just say probably one of the worst experiences with service I have ever had. So we got there around 9:30pm because we didn't want to deal with the crowds and we figured if it wasn't that busy we would be well taken care of...  We were wrong.  So we walked in and there was no one at the hostess station...so we stood there for a moment or two until the bartender saw us and came around the bar and seated us with everyone else...I for one am kind of particular about where I sit, I like my conversations to remain private and typically don't like to be seated around a lot of people but just by looking around you could tell the staff was busy trying to clean up for the night and everyone looked beat, I can only assume that the happy hour rush was bananas. And they had already proceeded to close off other areas of the restaurant. He did ask us if we wanted a booth or a table thou, and in all truth this gentleman was probably the best part of our service, he seated us. Told us about the specials. And was very polite then he mentioned that he was not a server but would get someone over to us right away...  So after several minutes our server came up...she looked beat...that or she had just taken some tranquilizers...  She didn't have two coasters for our drinks only one...she said she would be back shortly with our drink order an ice tea and a lemonade. 5 minutes later our drinks arrive. When she came back she didn't bring any bread...so we had to ask for it, she said it would be right out. 5 minutes later the bread comes out...it is barely warm, already hard and you can tell it was sitting out for a while...pretty much went down hill from here.   She never came by to check on us, it finally came to the point were I asked her to leave the pitcher of ice tea on the table because I got tired of waiting for her to come by for a refill. She never once checked on us in between service, of our appetizers we ordered the Coconut Shrimp and Stuffed Mushrooms nor did she tell us the food was oven hot, I burn my wrist on the edge of the stuffed mushroom dish. We got the entrees of Crab Linguini and Admirals Platter, we literally had to waive her down as she was going to other tables to get her attention.   Even when the end of our meal came we had to ask for a to go box and let her know that we were finished.  Being that I worked in the hospitality industry for almost 20 years I typically tip 20% or more if service is up to par...I didn't want to really tip her at all but I still gave her about $7 on my $40 check.   In general this place was dirty looking, dark, and the service was extremely poor. We wont be back. The only reason this place gets two stars was due to the exceptional bartender who originally seated us and the food was OK."}
{"text":"There are some restaurants that I don't eat at because I've never had a good meal there, or because there's plenty of local alternatives that are way better. Being from a seafood-rich area in the South, Red Lobster was always at the top of my \"Ain't No Way In Hell I'm Eating There\" list for both reasons. Then I find myself hungry, wanting a place with published nutritional information, and in Pittsburgh. Here I come Red Lobster!  The interior is fine, and the waitstaff were nice. I got a bowl of New England Clam Chowder, grilled shrimp house salad and a glass of wine for about $15. The chowder was fine, but the salad was disappointing. All of the lettuce was the white part of iceberg. Zero green lettuce in this salad. The waitress noticed that I only ate the shrimp off the top, and asked if there was a problem. She was sweet about it, but when I said that I wasn't going to eat a salad that was solely comprised of white iceberg, she told me that next time I could request Romaine.  Well, there's not going to be a next time, and I shouldn't have to request that my salad be made with actual green lettuce. Call me demanding."}
{"text":"Decent food but when you call in take out they don't prepare it until you get done there by the bartender which depending on how busy he/she is could be additional wait."}
{"text":"This is a good place to come to for a nice family dinner! I love their lobster and shrimp! The customer service here is always great !"}
{"text":"Well, actually no, I am not a big fan of this place, but we end up here once in a while (mainly for the bread, lol). : ) I think their fixed price 3 course meals are very reasonable. I have had some issues with consistency in the past but this was a very good experience. Our server Brian was very nice and patient, he took great care of us."}
{"text":"I used to frequent this location when  I lived in this area. I had the absolute worst experience while I was in town recently.  This will go down as the #1 worst restaurant experience I have ever had.  I am not kidding.  To say this location has gone downhill is an understatement. I will spare you all the details of what happened, but our waiter was so fed up that he WALKED out...as in quit. Shocking!!! No, not really bc the management there really sucks. Jerald the GM, and his manager Chris need to take some lessons in customer service.  Then, Jerald says...hope you will give us another try in the future.  NOT!!!!! We waited almost 2 hrs for the food to arrive. Then, the orders were not correct.  Trying to talk to both of these managers was like  talking to a brick wall. I would suggest to the both of you that if you don't like your job, please find a new one.  Also, work on your customer service skills. This place was an unorganized,chaotic mess. I have never seen anything like what I saw here last weekend. Thank goodness my Red Lobster here in Phoenix knows how to talk to, and treat their customer base. I am going to let everyone I know not to eat at this location. What is even more upsetting is that i suggested we go here. That was a bad decision on my part, it will NEVER happen again. Red Lobster in Pineville, NC...I have officially divorced you!   Sincerely,   Disgusted!! :|"}
{"text":"Red Lobster is  consistently excellent. The Biscuits may be a draw for some ,(altho I can only eat one myself).  I go back over and over because of the great staff, the impeccable Long Island Iced Teas and the always Hot Steamy Perfect  FRESH Lobster. Our Madison Red Lobster aims to please like no other chain in town. The menu is extensive and never disappointing. I am thrilled to have them here. Worth the time and money, every visit."}
{"text":"The last 2 times we were at the Decatur location, the food was bad and the service was worse. We went for dinner last week, and my \"medium\" steak was black outside and tough as leather. My wife's shrimp was also very over cooked. The waitress apologized and took them back, and we then waited 20 minutes for them to re-appear. During this time we had a waitress from another station come by to tell us how overworked they were, and how surprised she was that the cook would have sent our food out of the kitchen. The Manager came out to apologize, and to assure us that his employees were not over worked. We let him know this was the second time in as many months that this has happened. He did not offer us so much as a free soft drink or desert to make up for the inconvenience. We have been to this location several times, but won't be going back."}
{"text":"Went last night had the endless shrimp. They are so slow keeping up with the shrimp. Took me 2 hours to eat shrimp dinner. They are fast with the refills on your ice tea/bread though! The shrimp are a step above popcorn shrimp. The food tasted VERY salty and frozen taste from the shrimp. The food is sub par as we had the seafood stuffed mushrooms. $9.99 for six little mushrooms with a ton of butter in the little blue dish. Not very tasty as the butter over powers everything. If you get French fries ask for no salt, otherwise they taste like a salt lick! The salad was sad.  It had 4 croutons and 3 cherry tomatoes 1 little band of red onion with white salad leaves and a little plastic cup of salad dressing. Not a garden fresh green salad by any means. You would expect for $18.99 they would try to make your salad at least look appetizing. The baked potatoes? Yup you guessed it, SALT all over the outside of it and loaded with butter!FAIL! The only thing that was decent was the peach ice tea, but for $3.19 you better drink a gallon of it for that price! The ambiance was not so special either. No soft music just loud people and dishes banging in the sever area. How annoying! The waitress was excellent and very catering to our needs. Over all very high priced for frozen and not so fresh seafood. Pete's fish and chips is way better and cheaper as well. If you need better than sub par seafood might I recommend going somewhere else than commercialized Red Lobster."}
{"text":"Visited August 2013  I have been to many Red Lobsters before & this one does not meet the standards of the restaurant chain. All the workers didn't seem to care about the customers & the food wasn't all that good. Skip this spot if you can & find another restaurant. The only good thing is that is was right next to the hotel we were staying & & didn't have to hop in the car to go eat dinner."}
{"text":"Horrible! Very disappointing. Not all meals for table served at same time, 10 minute wait for missing meal. Believe they were scrambling to make, don't believe shrimp was cooked completely... Slightly cold. Manager was kind to remove, but this did not make up for inadequate wait staff."}
{"text":"Had the Ultimate Feast on Valentine's day, and it was delicious.  Went in to answer the hard-hitting questions like, is it worth S29.99 or nah? Was it as salty as all the yelpers have been saying or nah? It turns out the infamous cheese biscuits are in fact as salty as you've feared, but they're delicious.  The shrimp was delicious too.  But something about the lobster tail wasn't cute. It was rubbery.  The crab legs were good too but somehow they were too salty.  The broccoli was even salty.  Who the fudge is goofin around with the sodium chloride in the kitchen? When you come to this establishment, make sure you are armed with two weapons: cash money and the phrase, \"easy on the salt.\"  Oh, and yes, everything did smell fishy. When I read that as a complaint, I thought, well duh seafood is gonna smell fishy.  but it IS weird. The fishy smell is not cute.  3 stars and a big fat MEH."}
{"text":"Very disappointing.  I don't expect much from a chain but for the prices they charge, my meal was not very good at all.  Went with three girlfriends and ordered the Lobster bake.  The service was very good, but the food, yecchh!  None of the seafood had any flavor.  The scallops were ice cold and a different temp than the other fish.  The shrimps were devoid of any flavor at all and the lobster as well, a shame.  The linguini had no sauce that I could discern, so overall a bland, flavorless meal.  We did not stay for dessert.  For the same or less money, could have gone to the Keg and had a fabulous meal.  They are lined up every night here so I guess there a lot of people who don't know good food."}
{"text":"Despite a super busy Saturday night, which meant a busy kitchen and slower service, Red Lobster offers a great nautical dining experience, friendly service (ask for Ryan at the Bell location), and reasonable pricing.   We stopped in for the endless shrimp special running right now- particularly the new options of Parmesan peppercorn and the sriracha grilled shrimps. Amazing! The Parmesan shrimp comes with a tangy lemon aioli and be prepared for a spicy after taste with the sriracha shrimp! The shrimp linguini alfrado is one of my favs as well as the scampi so... when it's offered endlessly it makes my heart happy. And my belly.   They have a full bar and you'll be sure to find a nice cocktail to compliment your meal. We've never actually left room to try the desserts (did I mention endless shrimp?!) but I'm sure they are delish."}
{"text":"Been here a couple times, I always get the popcorn shrimp which I LOVE, but this time I was not too happy as the shrimp was not great. It tasted freeze dried as if it had sat open in the freezer for too long. Let the manager know, had to get to work and didnt want to take shrimp with me but she did take it off the bill. Still love the cheesy biscuits!!!"}
{"text":"I just had lobster dinner for Veterans Day with my buddy best meal I've had and everybody did an awesome job thank you Red Lobster"}
{"text":"My parents have basically been regulars here since '97, so I go here much more frequently than I care to admit.  Every once in a while, I get the urge for some Red Lobster grub, and I blame it all on the famous cheddar biscuits. They're not always consistent, but when you get them fresh out of the oven, they are amazing.   I'm not a fan of their salad (they come included with most mains).   The food is ok. I've enjoyed the fried shrimp with marinara sauce, as well as their lobster pizza appetizer. The alfredo pasta is DOUSED in alfredo sauce, so I now ask them to provide the sauce separately. Fish tacos and fish & chips have been disappointing.   Their chocolate cake with ice cream dessert is truly decadent and satisfies my sweet tooth (and then some) - it is super sweet, basically must be shared.  Note: they do not take reservations *update - just checked other reviews, apparently they take reservations if the group is 10+ people*"}
{"text":"I should have just lit $75 on fire then at least I would have enjoyed it better. Had a 20 minute wait even though the place was half full. It was lobster fest so I ordered the seafood feast, EVERYTHING was overcooked. Lobster was like rubber and the crab legs were so overdone the meat wouldn't come out of the shell. Never again Red Lobster never again."}
{"text":"There is better seafood to be had. Not saying this is bad, it's actually pretty good and far better than the other place where they serve your food in a mop bucket (it rhymes with Moe's Crab Shack)  Come here for the promo offers, otherwise it's overpriced.   ENDLESS SHRIMP!  My precious, Endless Shrimp. Get plenty of sleep, drink lots of water and arrive with your game face. Make it clear that you are not interested in anything else except gorging yourself with as much shrimp as possible, while eating as little salad and baked potato as allowed by law. The best is the coconut shrimp except that they've recently pulled a slick switcheroo. They don't offer you the Coconut shrimp until you're on round 3 of refills. My advice is to look them square in the eye, dead serious and say \"I know you have Coconut Shrimp in this building and that's what I want. If you aren't going to give it to me then I'm going to call the Nevada Department of Consumer Affairs, the State Attorney General and the Better Business Bureau. Furthermore, I will leave a bad review on Yelp! Bring the Coconut Shrimp now and forgo the salad and baked potato\".  It worked for me."}
{"text":"It's been years since I've been to a Red Lobster. We came to this location for a recent birthday.    Two in the party had lobster, the other two had fish. Value wise if you come to a RL then have lobster. I didn't taste anything special when it came to the fish dishes and found them to be way over priced for the portion served.  Sides were uninspiring - meh.   Establishment appears clean, service good.   Overall rather pricey for a mediocre meal."}
{"text":"- Food I loved their biscuits, and all the salads were just fine. We had the bar harbor lobster bake, wood-grilled lobster shrimp and salmon, and the lobster meat taco with mashed potato. With lobsters being lobsters and shrimps being shrimps, what I didn't like was the linguine inside the bar harbor lobster bake. It is not a pasta. Nobody cooks pasta that way. I deeply regret for once considering ordering a shrimp pasta here. Also, since they were out of salmon, we were served of some scallops instead. It wasn't too bad.  - Service There were too small number of waiters, so that we waited for like 30 minutes looking at the empty tables.  Two and a half stars were earned by a waitress who served us tonight. Katherine B, (if i am remembering that B correctly) was really kind and careful. I wish I could have given a half star more to this restaurant solely for her service."}
{"text":"Veronica was amazing, her recommendations were on point and even though we came in a bit late (9:30) she had a wonderful attitude and really made us feel welcome. I had the white wine garlic mussels appetizer and would definitely get it again. It was enough food to fill me up I didn't even need an entree and I'm pregnant! My husband got the sirloin with broccoli and a side of green beans and he loved all of it. The steak was cooked to order. He also ordered a bar drink after hours and Jeremy makes a great old fashioned! We hadn't been to Red Lobster in about 10 years so we didn't know what to expect but they sure made our experience great so we will be returning."}
{"text":"Good seafood. Tried the lobsterfest menu, shrimps were great. Sides were just ok. Our server Nicki was awesome, she was helpful in our selection of food since it was our first time"}
{"text":"Walked right in and was seated.   Alicia was a great service, very attentive, and on point.   Clean environment, fresh food and quick service. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Not enough to raise a star but the \"new\" wood grilled Atlantic Salmon is a big improvement over past gas grilling.  One way to get a better overall experience plus hotter rolls, salmon and steamed broccoli is to arrive just before 11 AM and be the first to be seated next to a window. Octoberfest also works for me.  For overall value in these \"uncertain\" times the fresh fish lunches are  good deals.  The waiter showed me a list of \"new\" fish for the future that I may try..."}
{"text":"Love their biscuits (of course) - the first batch we got were stale and not buttered but the ones after that were amazing.  Had the lobster pizza to start which was the best yet - it was perfectly crispy with just the right amount of cheese, and a good amount of shrimp and lobster. So delicious!  Their fish and chips taste better than it used to. I think they may have changed the recipe. The shrimp pasta was tasty, as it usually is (and the serving size is plenty for dinner plus leftovers to bring home).  Their prices on many dishes have gone up $3-$4 after the wage increase which is lame becuase they've also cut out the complimentary salad with your meal on top of that.   Our server, Christina, was excellent! Efficient and right to the point - no small talk required. I love that."}
{"text":"Red Lobster has always been one of my favorite seafood restaurants, especially with the unlimited cheddar biscuits that are best freshly served. My favourite dish is the roasted maritime lobster bake. The dish is filling, buttery and garlicky. The dish before came with a few mini potatoes and the dish didn't quite fill me up, but now that it comes with linguini instead of a few mini potatoes I enjoy it a lot more. I really liked the taste of the mini potatoes but wish they gave a lot more potatoes."}
{"text":"Good Hickory Cheeseburger and Good Service  Peter was a super friendly server. He made lots of conversation about Jeeps and was very amiable.   I had the Hickory Cheeseburger cooked medium well and it good. Good mashed potatoes side and the appetizer buns are great!   All in all I'm not sure why this place averages 3 stars... it's not a 5, but definitely with a"}
{"text":"Food is decent, but nothing we tried was fantastic except for the chedder bay biscuits. Service was good. Only complaint was that upon opening the silverware wrapper there was food inside. I asked the server for another set of silverware and the second set had a piece of a straw wrapper inside. Makes you wonder a bit about cleanliness standards. Overall a decent place for seafood in the desert, but I'm not excited about returning."}
{"text":"My fiance usually needs at least one or two trips a year to Red Lobster, to fulfill the Korean side of him that craves seafood.  I personally find the atmosphere and food to be vulgar, but how can I say no to someone who NEEDS seafood?! I usually get the half portion of salmon with a garden salad, rice palaf and vegetables.  It tastes exactly like I think it's going to: bland salmon flavor with lettuce, salty rice and salty vegetables.  Blech."}
{"text":"Verrrrry disappointed with tonight's meal.  We arived early around 530...no  waiting andcseated immediately. We ordered drinksand they arrived promptly. This is where the great sevice ended.  It took 7 minutes after drinks for waitress to come take our oder. In her defense she did seat a 7 top right next to us. We received our dinners and the waitress cane back to take a refill order.. it was 607pm. We ran out of water in our glasses, and our refill order never arrived. We saw our waitress at the table next to us and asked for more water. And let her know our refill has not arrived.. this was 627 pm.  We finally finished our meal at 647pm. I cant blame it all on the waitress, the kitchen staff was definitely not on spot tonight!!!"}
{"text":"Just had dinner here with the family and the food was good but the service was amazing and it takes a lot for me to say that. If you go sit in James section he is fabulous and I will be back just for him."}
{"text":"This had to be one of the worst experiences we've ever had at this location. The server Nikki was awful, the food was mediocre at best. Never will we sit in her area again!"}
{"text":"I'm a firm believer in second chances, and although it has taken us about a year to come back, we're glad we did. And we attribute our satisfied experience to the staff--and based on our last experience there, it was a surprise!   First off, we were greeted by two young ladies in the front. Prompt. Polite. We were already impressed.  Our server was Wes and can I just say, he was the easily the best server we've had yet. Everything he did seemed effortless and the attention to small details were not ignored. Very polite, patient, knowledgeable, prompt--he didn't miss a beat and he didn't overdo it by constantly coming to our table. It was a seamlessly perfect dinner. At Red Lobster. WHO KNEW?!  We chose the 4-course meal which was a good thing and a bad thing. Mostly good. The bad was based on the fact we couldn't get out of our seats.   We started off with soup: spicy chicken tortilla and New England clam chowder. Not out of this world, but still good and perfect complement to the mini-blizzard going on outside.  I had the shrimp and scallop linguini; rich and creamy but it was a perfect portion. I didn't feel like it was an overwhelming amount. Thank goodness because I ate the entire thing and I feel no guilt! =)  My boyfriend had the wood-grilled chicken with portobello wine sauce. That was also a nice portion, and the green beans were well-seasoned. We could've eaten an entire plate of that with no problem. I didn't get a chance to taste the chicken but he took it home and ate it for a late-dinner. No complaints from him as far as I know.  Desserts were a triple-chocolate brownie a la mode and caramel cheesecake. RICH. RICH. RICH. Good gracious--what a way to top off the meal. At first I was a little annoyed by the small portion, but as soon as I took a bite, I was so glad they were that size. I think my pants would've hated me.   Huge kudos to the management and staff (especially you, Wes!) for such a great experience. We were already having a somewhat off night and we took a chance to come eat here again, hoping it wouldn't be like the first time. Not even close.  And I know the exterior was changed but I could swear the inside was remodeled as well. It just didn't seem like previous experiences at other Red Lobster locations where I felt like I was on a fishery boat. Regardless, two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"I usually eat red lobster in wherever I'm living and was pretty disappointed by this one. The fried shrimp I had were undercooked and the salad, soups, and food all arrived at almost the same time. By the time I got to eat my shrimp it was cold and gummy.   Would recommend going to a different red lobster. The service was great, but the food was pretty much only good for the biscuits."}
{"text":"Always dependable when traveling in different cities. Got the salmon with shrimp sauce. Friendly people and great service. Very filling with mash potatoes and broccoli. In my opinion better than other options in the area"}
{"text":"I placed a to go order over the phone and when I arrived I had to wait an additional 20 minutes to get my lunch."}
{"text":"We used to eat here monthly and then they discontinued oysters so we stopped coming, had a coupon so thought we give it a try again. We were pleasantly surprised, meals were excellent, oyster were some of the best I've eaten in 30 years. Quite honestly, I couldn't believe it but again, very pleased with the entire experience."}
{"text":"Great service!!! Every time I come here the food is perfect ! But I love the enthusiasm from the servers there. They are super friendly and make you feel welcome. Best location."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! Polite servers. I had dinner here on valentines day and not sure what our waitress name was but she was very polite n helpful and sweet. Food was perfect! I had a great time and deff will be back."}
{"text":"It's been awhile since I've eaten at Red Lobster.  It is always hit and miss like most chains.  It's not too far from my house, and I wanted shrimp for dinner, so I decided to go there.  Needless to say, I was very impressed and had a great meal.  I believe my server's name was Michael.  He was very good and he explained the menu very well.  The service was very prompt and the food was very good.  I had the Shrimp Your Way, with popcorn shrimp and coconut bites, baked potato, and salad.  The salad was one of the best I've had in a restaurant and definitely the best I've had there.  Reason being, is that they put lots of dressing on the salad.   I like lots of dressing and it seems like no one ever puts enough on the salad.  The shrimp was very good and everything on the order was accurate.  The restaurant was very clean and it was a good dining experience.  The only two complaints I have was that the hostess was chewing gum.  As a former restaurant manager, there's no way that I would ever allow that.  it looks very tacky.  If you need something to keep your breath fresh,  try a mint or something like that.  Also, the Appetizer/Drink book that's on the table needed to be cleaned.  It should be cleaned when the table is bussed.  There were quite a few dirty and sticky pages in it.  But, that is typical in a lot of restaurants of this caliber.  Overall, it was a very good experience."}
{"text":"Now you want to talk about all star service!? My family and I got together to celebrate my graduation/birthday and I got to say that the service we received from Sydney, our server was absolutely hands down the best service I ever gotten from anywhere. She was always there, making us laugh, making us feel taken care of, went above and beyond what usual service I get, the celebration will be burned in my memory forever simply because the staff made it a memorable night! The food was delicious,  as always, I had the ultimate feast, with the bourbon shrimp with it, and the caprese salad, I ate every last bite! I asked Sydney about the wine bottle on the table that my balloons were tied to, and said it would be great if I could have it as part of the moment, so I got it, then to top it all off, I got a very special person to sing me happy birthday, Tenisha Hyde, who had the voice of an angel! Then as they gave me desert they brought out a pasta plate that had the following written in icing... \"Happy Birthday Michael, Congratulations on graduating and thank you for your service!\" Just when you thought this review was over, so Sydney took so many pictures on multiple platforms for us, and at the end let me pick up a couple lobsters and pose with them! It was the most fun I have had in a very long time and was very very enthusiastic about making this my destination for all my celebrations! This is how service everywhere should be!!! Take notes! Because this place is off the chain with service and deliciousness!;)"}
{"text":"Tasty food and good, service I read the warning label on the menu warning about possible food poisoning risks with seafood and ignored it and by time I was trying to go to bed I've never felt so sweaty/dizzy and so full of stomach cramping filled shit and puke..omg I'm writing this post day later cause I've been so miserable trying to just clear my stomach and feel better..haven't had red lobster in years and missed it and was happy with how everything tasted but after me getting this duck with my stomach rejecting it I'll never be back to try again unless is fried shrimp...ONLY..sucks :'("}
{"text":"So the corporation is circling the drain in terms of gust attendance and income, so what do they do: Shrink the size of their signature food item. Went to this location for a small birthday celebration and ordered the Fishermans Feasts which usually has a large size lobster tail as part of the feast. These   tiny crustaceans must have been a special order at the wholesaler, because I would assume maritime rules would require them to be thrown back to grow some more. Typical commercial economics, when sales are down, become lethargic to your customers and wait for some hedge fund to buy you out and resell it to some unsuspecting wank who knows how to declare bankruptcy. Whatever happened to taking pride of ownership and super sizing the offers to retain customers and have those customers invite their friends. Definitely the last time I will hit this location, which I have only done in the past dues to the availability of parking. Previously hit the one on the Queensway, which I thought was an anomaly in the chain, it was o bad, compared to the Bay Street location, which I sure will be the last one to hit the drain."}
{"text":"My family and I chose this restaurant for my mothers 79th birthday, as it is her favorite.  We called ahead of time and were told that they do not take reservations on weekends.  We had a party of 7; 5 adults and 2 children.  When we arrived, we were told there would be a 30 minute wait.  We ended up waiting over an hour to be seated.  The hostess offered to buy us some appetizers.  We accepted that.  My adult daughter and I decided to split the Rock Lobster, Snow Crab and Shrimp Scampi dinner.  When it arrived, the lobster tasted of ammonia.  I sent it back and they replaced it.  The second one also tasted of ammonia.  I told the server to never mind, as I saw no need to order a third one only to waste it.  They did not reduce the bill or anything. I will NEVER go back to that Red Lobster.  Fortunately, the bill that was presented had a survey on it.  I did respond to it."}
{"text":"Call to place a pick up order as I'm placing the order the gentleman on the phone has an attitude did not want to give me the breakdown of my bill. when I started asking questions. He kept putting me on hold, it took me a half an hour to get my order placed. once my order was completed the gentleman just hung up the phone on me. Super rude people in horrible customer service"}
{"text":"The service was excellent the place was very clean, and the food was very fresh. Very good biscuits."}
{"text":"I come to this location nearly every other week to dine. As crazy as that may sound since I never get tired of their food. It truly impresses me each and every time, being served to this level of perfection as well as the meals no matter what I order."}
{"text":"I was actually quite surprised by the service and quality of food on our visit today. Prior to ordering, the server asked if we had a bday or anniversary which we were. When we asked for 2 extra breads they brought us 6, and they were also informative as to the daily specials. The server was polite, thoughtful and attentive, which again seems to be reflective of improved staff training and perhaps not just specific to the server. These traits ensure repeat business. We had plenty of leftovers (after filling on Caesar salad and bread) and at the conclusion they comped us with a cheesecake tart for the birthday. Nicely done!"}
{"text":"IF YOU WANT TO EAT HERE. BIG. MISTAKE.  WORST FOOD EVER.  The food was disgusting. You could honestly make something better yourself and for way cheaper. TOO expensive for shit food. The only thing I've heard good about red lobster are their biscuits and they actually were really good but everything else. GROSS. I honestly feel like vomiting. Do NOT waste your money here. Service was mediocre but it's really just about the food. It's garbage. I hate it. You've ruined my night. I wish I had gone somewhere else. Even McDonald's could have been better. I'm just so pissed I wasted my money."}
{"text":"Red Lobster has one thing going for it.  Consistent food quality each and every time.  Service is always great and the food is fresh and tasty.  The menu is extensive and the all you can eat Cheese Biscuits are a nice touch!  Great place for a chain restaurant."}
{"text":"I had a group outing with some female friends last night - dinner and a show. Said friends all ganged together and chose \"Red Lobster\" for dinner, sort of in an ironic, retro, rural kind-of way. Knowing I would be late and miss most of the meal, I said I was in. They met at 6, and I sms-ed one of them at 6:30 to say I was about to leave. They were just ordering then, so I had them add in a shrimp ceasar salad for me.  I arrived at almost 7 and the food had not yet arrived. I recommend this as the best way to experience Red Lobster - you can avoid the waiting!! Just have your friends go early and order for you! Food came within 5 minutes of my arrival, so it really was perfect for me.  I was surprised by the fact that they did wait so long because the restaurant was not busy at all, and Jason, our server, was extremely pleasant and accessible. One of the stars is solely for Jason.   I found the prices too high for what was served. Entrees are in the $20+ range, and the portions are measly. All I got was the ceasar salad, and the shrimp definitely seemed like frozen bagged shrimp, and the dressing was very heavy. Bland.  The biscuits they serve were REALLY GOOD though! Seriously good. One of the stars is for the biscuits. And Jason kept bringing more baskets of them, without charging us.  Another plus was that Jason obligingly provided separate bills, without any complaints. I liked him. I hope he can move up to a better establishment soon.  All in all, Red Lobster was better than I expected, but then, I didn't expect much."}
{"text":"Love me some Red Lobster! I heard a rumor that Red Lobster will be shutting done across the valley. I can't understand why... This place is unlike any other.   Red Lobster had been the trademark for affordable seafood experience for as long as I can remember. I can't imagine not having them around anymore. Once I heard this horrific and frightening news, I decided to march on over to my local Red Lobster is get my fix of seafood craving while I still can. I forgot how much I adore this place so much I actually came twice in a row back to back nights, and ordered the same dish! Wowzers!!   I started out with some appetizers coconut shrimp and lobster stuffed mushrooms. These were a perfect start to a wonderful seafood experience.  The bread biscuits that come with your beverages are unbelievable! I couldn't stop hoovering them down, they are so good! HAHA...  For my main course I went with the Ultimate Feast. Which comes with delicious Shrimp scampi, a bundle of snow crab legs, a handful of fried shrimp, and an adequately sized lobster tail. My sides where mashed potatoes, and a side salad. Wow a lot of food for under $30!  After all this deliciousness I was fully satisfied and ready for bed. haha The waiter asked if dessert was on my mind, I said absolutely not!   Like I said... I was so happy to be here that I decided to visit again the very next day! Please don't close Red Lobsters!!"}
{"text":"Seafood is great, service is wonderful. Steak is not as good as expected for the price. My wife definitely enjoyed her seafood treat."}
{"text":"So far, so good!!!  Had a gift card and a coupon so we went in yesterday for an early dinner before heading to the strip for a show.   We only waited about 5 minutes for staff to clean a table off.  Our server Brendon was awesome!  Extremely attentive and welcoming--just couldn't do enough for us and gave us extra cheese biscuits to take home.   This place does well because they know how to treat their customers, serve good food, good portions and decent prices!!!"}
{"text":"We sat at the bar for dinner. Every single employee behind the bar--and I mean every single employee from the Bartenders to staff passing through, bad mouthed each other, their job or both in front of all guests. This happened for the duration of our visit. Not many good things to say about this unprofessional Red Lobster location. My salad had green tomatoes in it and my broccoli was over-cooked to light green. The shrimp was good. This is why I don't do many chains. Poor quality and morale."}
{"text":"First of all place is really smelly like the haven't changed the carpet in 20 years it was so musty that it ruined the dining experience. After a short wait we were seated by a very awkward hostess then the waiter came by his name was angel instead of making some nice suggestions on drinks and appetizers he was very high pressure on what we should order it made my wife uncomfortable. The food was good tho"}
{"text":"It was our first time at Red Lobster, and probably our last. For app, we got the stuffed mushrooms with shrimp and lobster. The shrooms were tiny and I maybe saw once piece of lobster meat. Bleh I got the Lobster lovers feast, and both lobster tails were good. BUT, the shrimp linguini totally blew. The shrimp were the size of bay shrimp, the pasta was WAY overcooked, and the Alfredo sauce was....grainy. Wifey got the shrimp trio, and the only thing she liked was the scampi. Kids (who aren't picky eaters) didn't care for their food either. Disappointing"}
{"text":"Another terrific outing to David Harling's Atrium location of RL.  We were back seated in Jorge's section and received the same attentive, cordial and enthusiastic service we've grown accustomed to.  Notably, some things are set to change at this location.  We got the scoop about major overhauls to the dining room decor that will follow the change in RL's ownership (sale by Darden to Golden Gate Capital in mid-2014).  Will provide an update after our next visit."}
{"text":"Thank you to the manager currently on duty with dealing with my allergic reaction in a speedy and efficient manner"}
{"text":"The food here is OK, but I have never had unsatisfactory service.  The clam chowder is not the best and the salad is usually not very fresh.   The lobster pizza is good and I recommend the grilled fishes.  My one friend is watching her diet, so if you don't want anything buttery, just get grilled fish with broccoli.  Even the petite green beans have butter, which is what makes it so freakin' delicious.  They have a deal right now that's 4 for 15.99,and it's awesome.  It comes with a cup of soup, salad or cole slaw, am entree, and dessert.  Of course you have to choose from what's listed, but it's a generous list and they all sound good.  I like the key lime pie...it has a raspberry drizzle!  I dad hates citrusy stuff but he like this pie!"}
{"text":"Way overpriced for quantity of food. A two item dish for &18.99 included two tiny entrées, in this case shrimp scampi and a small piece of flounder, an iceberg lettuce salad (cheap) and one side, which I ordered rice pilaf. I got about 1/4 cup of rice. Our party of 4 ordered each ordered some of the lesser expensive adult dishes, no drinks, no appetizer or dessert, and our bill with tax came to over $80 not including the 20% tip for our server. All in all, we each paid about $25 and needed a snack less than an hour later."}
{"text":"Oh my god it was gross. The place is dark and dirty. Spent the whole time swatting away flies. The carpet should be removed. The food looked nothing like the pictures or commercials. My pasta looked like it had been thrown on the plate and had no taste and the clam chowder was watered down and tasteless. The so called lobster pizza, come on guys it was beyond disgusting, don't know what you call the objects they put on that pizza, but is wasn't lobster."}
{"text":"Just walked out of this red lobster  on flamingo and eastern they sat us down and no one even acknowledge us so we walked out never to return"}
{"text":"Dined at RL on Saturday night with the girls (wife, daughter, and M in Law).  Surprised to see how busy it was for a Saturday @ 6 but that's the crowd they draw.  Waited the quoted 20-25 and got seated and greetd by our \"Seafood Expert\" Tim.  Ordered the Shrimp Trio and got what I expected. M in Law not too happy with her fried shrimp size, but matches the price I quess.  Very accomodating in getting the \"Seafood Hater' daughter a plate of linguini with butter.  Wifey had the Cedar Salmon grilled on a plank, very happy.  Drinks were cold, cheddar bisquits were abundant....overall good time."}
{"text":"First time eating at Red Lobster, it was my mom, herboyfriend, my wife and I. There was a 20 minute wait so we were able to sit at the bar until our table was ready. I had a bloody Mary that was delicious. Out waitress was Kim and was great! She is a large reason for our enjoyable visit with her cheerful attitude and charm we had full forks, full cups and smiles on our face. The food was excellent and my wife who is picky when it comes to seafood enjoyed her fish and chips and side of fried shrimp. Will mod fed be back! THANKS KIM!!!!"}
{"text":"I like Red Lobster but not this location. I got some kinda food poisioning from the Shrimp alfredo from the Southern Ave. location. If you wanna know what kind of bathroom experience I had after Red Lobster, just pour yourself a big bowl of Cocoa Pebbles and let it sit for 2 hours and then throw it against the wall.  You then get the sight and sound."}
{"text":"Red lobster is always yummy. My nephew's favorite is crab so we went there. It's crabfest and I have to say his portion was sad. For $30 I   thought it was skimpy. I ordered another side of crab for him. My dish was a special and delicious. We had a nice time though the wait staff was a bit scarce. The reason I gave it a 4 was not because of any of that. It's that you can smell the bathroom before you get to it. I  think they need to be snaked , that may address the issue but just putting a spray over it doesn't work."}
{"text":"I'm not really a seafood person but I definitely have a weakness for Red Lobster, LOL. The parmesan crusted tilapia is my favorite. I stopped in with my mom on Mothers Day and she loved it! Good atmosphere, courteous wait staff and awesome peach tea."}
{"text":"There are a lot of things wrong with Red Lobster and this Red Lobster in particular: the poor service; rigid, uncomfortable booths; understaffing, leading to unexpectedly long wait times in a three-quarters empty restaurant at 9pm on a Sunday night; one of the toughest and worst steaks I've had in recent memory; sad-looking green beans lacking any semblance of freshness; an uninspiring mashed potato side; and a red velvet cake-in-a-mason jar that was an abomination of a dessert (crammed with way too much cream cheese and sugar and not much actual cake--and the cake that was there was dry and nearly stale).  Despite all that, Red Lobster does two things pretty well--at least enough for one to start to think about considering a return visit: the addictive, cheddar biscuits and, true to its namesake, the lobster, which was prepared better than many local restaurants held in much higher regard."}
{"text":"Ded Lobster-why do I keep doing this to myself?  Ordered the Garlic Lobster Linguini for $24.50. A healthy portion of tough, flavourless lobster on a thin bed of soft, over cooked linguini, floating in a slough of melted butter or oil (about 1/2 cup of liquid).   The garden salad was fine, and the best part of the meal was the biscuits.  The main course is basically a sodium bomb. Thankfully Chatime is next door so I can dilute the saltiness.   Next time I better re-read my past reviews to remember."}
{"text":"The only reason this Red Lobster is getting 2 stars is because our waiter was amazing and the food was...edible.   Mediocre food, but it is extremely overpriced. Our seafood was drenched in as much butter as you'd find water at Niagara Falls! We couldn't tell whether or not the shrimp and salmon was fresh because all we tasted was butter! My garden salad had a rotting piece of lettuce as well. The margaritas and mixed drinks are extremely overpriced as well. My husband's margarita was all ice, high priced, and not nice..lol. To charge $13 for it was a complete sham.   Also, this Red Lobster does not offer military discounts. Blasphemy."}
{"text":"We went on a busy night, we waited a little but the service was outstanding!  There was a hair in one of our salads. Boo!! We got half off the bill because of it! Woohoo!"}
{"text":"I was really grossed out seeing the guy who cleans the tables, eat the food while cleaning the tables. Sad! I normally like coming to this red lobster.  Has anyone ever realized that you normally pick lobster by the size of their claws and you never get claws with your lobster?"}
{"text":"I remember the Red Lobster when they used to be incredible.  Now, they are just middle of the road.  They have become what they are:  a restaurant chain.  But my son loves them [he's 8], so we go there from time to time.  When we were younger, we went because the food was good to decent, and it was relatively inexpensive.  However, the food is still good to decent, but their prices have crept up to the point where they are no longer a bargain."}
{"text":"I agree with Ebony that sometimes Red Lobster does get a bad rap....but this location is a very good one......as long as you get here early (LOL). This locale is always busy.....but the food.....customer service....and the overall ambience of the place really shines. Molly was our server when the wife and I visited this locale for dinner this past Friday night. Right now they have a 15 dollar 4 course meal promotion.....and I am telling you it was the best 15 bucks I have ever spent. I started with the New England Clam chowder.....this is my favorite soup in the whole world BAR NONE. Then I had the Caesar Salad with the Cheddar Bay biscuits which I always have two baskets of ....because those Biscuits will really make you hurt someone they are so good......(LOL). I had the Shrimp and Grilled Chicken in a great garlic and butter sauce with garlic mashed potatoes.....OMG.....the chicken was so juicy and the potatoes just melted in my mouth.  Dessert was a very rich and delicious Key Lime Pie......ALL THIS FOR 15 BUCKS......WOW. I felt like I was stealing in a way (LOL) but again if there is a better deal in the valley for a dinner this good.....please let me know. So run don't walk to you nearest neighborhood Red Lobster and try this deal before it's gone. Eat, Drink, and be Merry my Friends!!!!"}
{"text":"First review with the Galaxy Note 5. One of us had the broiled salmon and one of us had the broiled trout. Broiled salmon looked good, looked well cooked. The broiled trout didn't have real butter - it was a buttery oily covering and too much of it. Broccoli was over steamed. Green beans were very much too oily and not much in the way of tomato - it may have been sun-dried tomato, not sure. Biscuits were delicious & service was attentive."}
{"text":"We had a large group of about 15 just this evening 8/28. It was such a fantastic experience. Everyone's orders were perfect, no complaints. Drinks were refilled almost instantaneously. The manager and servers were very attentive and made sure everything was done well."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this location for over 20 years and the service and food have always been fantastic.  We came here the other night because I had a craving for crab legs. I had the 1lb snow crab legs but instead of having the corn and red potatoes that come with the dish, I opted for the roasted mixed vegetables and a garden salad. My husband selected from a four-course special they were offering and chose cheese and broccoli soup, a caesar salad, shrimp and scallop linguine and the caramel cheesecake for dessert.  Everything I've ever had at this restaurant has been delicious and tonight was no exception. The service was quick and friendly. The atmosphere is relaxed and comfortable albeit quite a bit more dimly lit than it used to be... you can still see your food, just not the person you're dining with (I kid!) and although the restaurant was relatively full, it was surprisingly quiet.  Overall, a wonderful dinner and I will continue to come here."}
{"text":"Laura and myself just finished a wonderful dinner here.  Our waiter Jesus is certainly one of the best waiters we have ever had.  Very attentive to our needs, very customer service oriented.  Made a good night fantastic!"}
{"text":"I went to red lobster for the first time in Calgary, I had heard from a friend of mine that this was the best seafood restaurant in Calgary, and considering I have been to some great ones I believed him.   He was wrong.   The service is ok, and the ambience is alright but the food is average at the best of times. The MOST IMPORTANT PROBLEM is that the food is much much smaller than advertised on TV or even the menus. Tiny in fact in comparison. The lobster was good, grab legs were good, but the vegetables were very undercooked, and the crab cakes were below average. I love seafood and I wish a chain as big as this one would have been a little less disappointing."}
{"text":"I do my best to avoid chains but we decided to head on over.  The food is what we normally expect, pretty consistent every visit.  Never a wow factor but never bad either.  The Salmon New Orleans might be the best they have.  What took this from a 3 star to a 4 star is our server Amanda.  She delivered one of the best performances I have seen!  Great interaction with my kids, assisted my oldest in cracking some crab legs, treated my youngest to some cherries only if he finished his chicken.  Absolutely amazing!  She needs to train and lead a team!"}
{"text":"My moms favorite restaurant and she always gets the Coconut Shrimp with pina colada dipping sauce from the appetizer menu.  Prices have drastically increased over the years, so we find that we don't dine here very often. Absolutely love their garlic cheese biscuits. Service was good, meals were good, only disappointment was to find out they no longer salt the outside of their potatoes. Gosh I loved those potatoes. Apparently someone sued Red Lobster for getting injured on \"salt\".  really people!!!!????"}
{"text":"We were in a hotel across the street, and Red Lobster was right there.  Didn't have to get back on I271, good choice.  Friday 6PM no reservation...and no wait!  We were seated in the front lounge.   We found a Coupon on Yelp for free appetizer/or desert, with 2 dinners.  So we started with Mussels steamed in a white wine broth--tasty and at least 18 in the bowl!  My wife chose Fish and Chips, and I tried the Parmesan Crusted Talapia, wow for both. Glad we didn't chow down on the cheesy biscuits that started the night--wouldn't have had room for all fish. Very pleased with our server, Carl, who had at least 5 other tables in our area.   Glad we stopped right near the hotel!"}
{"text":"Definitely not too fast but they do make up for it with courtesy. The staff is very respectful and nice in general. Even the bus guy or girl is smiling. So if you need good energy or vibes this is most definitely the place to go. Now the food is basic no different from any other Red Lobster I've been too. Barely season and the hot off the grill or oven. I ordered online off the yelp app. The process was quick and painless but the pickup took forever. Most definitely will try the restaurant again the cheddar biscuits are amazing."}
{"text":"100% recommend the pre-fix menu!   I got the Vegetarian soup, Caesar salad, cajun chicken pasta, and upgraded the brownie with ice cream to a vanilla bean cheesecake!  All just soo good!! Especially the cheesecake!!  Total pre-fix menu was $22, plus and an extra couple bucks for the upgrade in dessert. So worth!"}
{"text":"First off, not a seafood fan, but still found plenty of great options here to eat.  Started off with the sampler of Dragon Broccoli which was great! Super crispy with a great tasting breading on the broccoli.  Ended up getting the pre-fix menu option which was soo worth. For $21.99 the meal included a vegetable soup, a ceasar salad, a cajun chicken alfredo, and a brownie with ice cream for dessert. All the food was amazing.   The staff was also amazing and super accommodating. My cousin ended up getting a full lobster which he wasn't a fan of since it was a tad over cooked and tough, so they took it back and offered another or something else. He tried the lobster tail which was the same, so he ended up just saying it was fine and he didn't want anything else. The staff handled the situation with great customer service as they comped his meal since he wasn't satisfied with the food he was served. No fuss or anything, unlike other restaurants who simply apologize but don't do much about it.   Overall, great experience and I'll definitely be back,"}
{"text":"Due to Red Lobster closing down in 2015, the gals and I decided to indulge in Lobster Fest last night. We were looking forward to it all week. We arrived at a busy hour - 6pm, dinner time. The parking lot was fairly packed but we were seated quickly. Our waitress was friendly but I had the impression she was new and she seemed pretty nervous. We ordered our drinks right away but it did take her a really long time to come back and actually take our orders. We finally each gave our orders and also ordered the Lobster Dip for an appetizer. I had ordered the 4-Course Feast which comes with a soup, salad, entrée and dessert. It's about $20 and I've had it at least 2x in the past.   We got our soups and salads all at the same time. Then we anxiously waited for our dip. It never came. We did receive our entrée's and that's when we asked where our appetizer was. The waitress said she forgot. And since, we already got our orders, we just told her to not bother punching it in at this point. I had the cheddar broccoli soup and it was ok. Very small portion but tasty. The Caesar Side Salad was delicious. I could have eaten more of that. I do appreciate the thinly shaven parmesan cheese they use now as opposed to the grated style.   Our entrée's came out and everyone just looked at my meal confused. While everyone else's meals were quite large, my portion of the entrée was incredibly small. I ordered the Shrimp and Scallop Linguine in a white wine sauce with tomato's. I told them to hold the scallops though. For some reason they brought me Shrimp Alfredo Linguini instead of just giving me the same pasta but no scallops. This isn't the first time this has happened to me at Red Lobster. Every time I tell them to hold the scallops for some reason they bring me the Shrimp Alfredo Linguini instead of the White Wine Sauce Linguine with Shrimp and Tomato's.    I was way too hungry to bother complaining and since I'm a fan of the Shrimp Alfredo, I just ate it but the size was SO small compared to my friends orders. Two girls ordered off the same 4-Course Feast Menu but got the Chicken Alfredo pasta instead. Theirs was massive. The other two gals got the \"Create Your Own 2\" combo so theirs was gigantic as well. There was definitely not enough for me to take for my lunch the next day while the other ladies were able to leave with doggy bags. No lunch for Susan.   I asked the waitress why my portion was so tiny and she said \"Oh...yea.. well the shrimp linguini is made with only one bag of linguini\".  So, am I to assume that the Chicken Alfredo is made with 2 bags of Linguini or possibly even 3 seeing as their portion was SO large? I just shook my head and took my caramel cheesecake to go. If they are going to skimp on the portions based on discrimination of Scallops/Shrimps vs. Chicken, they should let people know that it will be extremely smaller compared to the other pasta options so that people can decide whether they want this or not. I could understand if the shrimp and scallops were massive but they are actually quite tiny while my friend's had huge grilled chicken pieces with tons to spare and eat later.  Word of Advice: ASK IF THE PORTIONS FOR PASTA ARE ALL THE SAME FOR THE 4-COURSE FEAST!"}
{"text":"I have never had an issue with the food but don't ever go with a large party and expect they will keep your party together. We had a party of 22 and they had the party scattered amoung several tables in a large room. It sure makes it hard to socialize when your back is facing half the party."}
{"text":"I do prefer not to go to chains, but sometimes it is the best option when you're looking for all you can eat shrimp, affordability, and to relive childhood memories. I have not been to a Red Lobster in many many years, but I was really craving some shrimp and they had their special going on so I was like \"let's do this!\"  Roll up on a Sunday afternoon with a friend and we both got the all you can eat shrimp special for $17.99. With the meal you get a salad and a side. I went with a caesar salad and upgraded to the lobster mashed potatoes. Just a tip, ask for your dressing on the side, otherwise your salad is going to be saturated with dressing. Our waiter Tim brought us out some fresh cheddar bay biscuits. For the shrimp I tried the buttery scampi, the new Nashville hot, coconut shrimp bites, and the shrimp alfredo. The Nashville hot was really good - fried, with a spicy kick and a drizzle of sweet honey. The alfredo is a huge portion with a hint of garlic. They let you take home your leftovers which provided me with two more meals!   Our waiter Tim was on top of his game. Pleasant and attentive. The manager even stopped by twice to check in on us which I thought was a nice touch.   Overall it was a good gluttonous lunch with great service. The things is though, eating here gave me a wake up call. In looking back at the picture I took of my plate, everything is a variation of white/tan. No color. When I tracked what I ate in the MyFitnessPal app it came out to 3,535 calories (split over 3 meals and includes half a slice of chocolate cake). Like sweet baby Jesus! I do not regret coming here, but it will probably be my last visit. I don't mind being juicy, but as juicy as a gallon of milk is way too much. I need to stay home and eat broccoli."}
{"text":"Good food as always. The staff was friendly. I typically don't do chain restaurants but this is a good location"}
{"text":"Every time I have gone to Red Lobster except one has been a great experience. The waiters are some of the best of any restaurant in Las Vegas. The food and drinks were prepared perfectly. There was virtually no wait time and the place was packed. I wish I could some back more often."}
{"text":"Manager was very nice and pleasant and so were the servers...place is clean and food is great. Even when it was 6pm, we got seated quickly.  To be worked on: time that it takes to get the food out, otherwise, it was a pleasant restaurant!"}
{"text":"First impressions when you walk in is an overwhelming fishy smell. I do realize it's a seafood restaurant, but the smell was as if it was embedded in the carpet, walls, and seats. It seemed dark in there. We were seated at a fairly small table near a high trafficked area. I ordered 1lb of crab legs and my husband got the endless shrimp. The biscuits were a bit dry. They were warm, but possibly just reheated, or so it tasted that way.  For the cost, I really wasn't impressed with the presentation and the plates it came in. My husband loved his food. The breaded shrimp were tiny! The shrimp on the skewer didn't seem fully cooked to me, but my husband liked it. The Korean sauce on the unlimited shrimp was good. My crab was pretty good. The crab legs were pretty small, but still okay.  Doubtful I will be back. Maybe it was where we were seated that was a turn off, but the smell was too overwhelming for me."}
{"text":"Basing this on our last experience...  Unfortunately, this was our worst experience and it will take me time to recover.  The service was horrible.  I am not going to go into details, but here are some tips for their staff:  1.  When three people are sharing a meal or two, please bring extra plates & crab tools. 2.  Provide refills- grab your tips from other tables after you check on your table 3.  Do not over cook the lobster.  It was harder than the sole of my boots. 4.  When a customer cuts their hand trying to pry out overcooked lobster, offer a band aid. 5.  When customers have their coats on and keys in their hand, please take them their check & ask if they need a to go box. 6.  Don't forget to bring the hand wipes.  Customer like to clean their hands after cracking open seafood."}
{"text":"Only 3 stars... it's overrated! The prices are crazy and the food is average and small portion is served.  The lobster is dry and really doesn't deserve to be served in a restaurant called \"red lobster\"!  The customer service is definitely not the best!  For that price, do not hesitate to visit another place. (The Keg is way better!!!)"}
{"text":"Wonderful. Amazing family environment, very clean, wonderful food, and great service."}
{"text":"This is the slowest service.  We sat for an hour before our food came and it took forever to get our drink order in.  Then nobody checked in on us and we had to flag someone else down for a drink refill"}
{"text":"Affordable seafood dishes and those cheesy biscuits are enough to always keep me coming back!  I had a crab melt sandwich last time I stopped in for lunch and I really enjoyed it. Lots of options and combos to pick from.  Best part of our visit was our wonderful server, Jada. She was not only very attentive the whole time we were there, but ran out to catch me at the car just in time to give me the credit card I had left behind! THANK YOU!"}
{"text":"Generally I like RL for their consistency. Although they are overpriced and use way too much salt in most items, their fresh fish menu is usually a good bet.  I have been three times to this particular location and it fails to meet my expectations overall.   Firstly, the hostess station is right by the toilets so I am assuming (hoping) that is why it always smells like poo upon entering.  Service is just meh. And the food itself... I've been given warm, wilted, super goopy ceaser salad. Way over grilled trout. Old biscuits. And plates that didn't seem to come right away from the kitchen but rather sat for a while.   The one time I was in for their endless shrimp promo the service was friendly AND the food was very much as expected for RL so because of that experience they get a second star."}
{"text":"This place has the best service in town . Sydney our server was exceptional and I hope she's a tra"}
{"text":"A couple of weeks ago we visited this Red Lobster location for the all you can eat shrimp special.  As we expected for a Friday night at 5:30, the wait time was 20-minutes.  I think because of where we were seated, we did not have the best customer service experience. Our server was pleasant and helpful. But because we were off in a corner and it was busy, it took a long while for a dish to come out. When it did and as we watched, our dinner 'floated' around the restaurant for a little bit until this other server noticed that we didn't have any food and by reason of elimination, made the connection that it belonged to us with the explanation, \"all the servers help one another out. its so busy in the kitchen that when they call out the table numbers, they all run together so I can't really make out which table the food belongs to.' Thanks for admitting that, I think.  So although the all you can eat shrimp was $17.99, the dishes are really greasy. As you get older, your digestive system can only handle so much grease.  As my husband's patience was growing noticeably thin about the wait time and the few times our server had forgotten a few times to drop off something at our table, my husband chalked up the slow service to our server being \"forgettable\".  I understand that people are working hard and I commend them for it. I have no experience working in a restaurant. But as a patron, I have experienced fabulous customer service in extremely busy environments. So I do expect with coaching, one can improve their customer service skills, especially in a very service oriented industry.  So for this particular experience 2-stars. I hope to update it with a future visit."}
{"text":"We came here for a dear friends birthday and the services was HORRIBLE, it was slow and the waiter James was rude. He took his sweet time taking our orders, getting drinks, and bringing our food and it was like once we started eating he came with to-go box and tried to put our food in to the container well mid eat, didn't even ask if we was finished. And its not the first time that service was bad there."}
{"text":"Though the food was good the service was extremely slow. Took 20 min to order, 40 min for food, 35 min to get our check after we completed eating and the waitress asked if we wanted dessert.   Service was poor for Red Lobster"}
{"text":"Nothing out of the ordinary it's red lobster A. Food was o.k service is o.k. Just A O.K. We all been there,it's not changed in 20 years..."}
{"text":"Our waitress was awesome, the bread cheese buns we're great that they give you when you first sit down. This is the very best I can do for this establishment, hope this helps you I do not recommend this place at all."}
{"text":"good food horrible waitress!! Refused to help my kids crack there Crab legs. I had to crack mine,my wife's, and my two kids Crab legs by the time I got to eat mine they were Cold. I was told kitchen would crap them before the dinner was brought out but the same waitress we had 3 times in a row was RUDE and REFUSED to help us. I will REFUSE to except her as my waitress Ever again."}
{"text":"Red Lobster is one of my favorite places to eat at. I love the food and the service I receive whenever I go there. The food is one of the focal points in the restaurant. Seafood is my favorite type of food to eat. My favorite dish served is the Shrimp Cocktail. I was there a couple of months for my birthday and all I felt was happy that I could be in there. My waiter made my birthday feel extra special because he wished me a happy birthday and made the end of the day worth the wait.   There can be, at times, where the service is lacking. Ask for something more than once, waiting a long time for someone to wait on our table, and waiters that don't make you feel welcome. I'm not saying that is every single time, but it does happen. However, this has only happened a couple of times in many times I have been there.   Basically, what I am trying to say, is that I love Red Lobster with a passion. Sometimes the service can be lacking, but it is not very often. Another one of my favorite things about Red Lobster is when they let you pet the live lobster. That is up to par with the Shrimp Cocktail. That is heaven in my mouth. Hopefully, this review helps and I hope that many people enjoy Red Lobster as much as I do."}
{"text":"A friend and I went here after seeing the Lobster Specials on TV. We had a great dish called the lobster bake. 2 tails with shrimp and scallops over linguini, delicious! Service was good. The atmosphere is perfect for socializing. I had lunch the next day with my to go box. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Do not order the lobster tacos. It was filled with 90% cabbage and had 3 little nuggets of lobster meat the size of a grape in each tacos (3).  My husband ordered the lunch fried catfish that didn't look fried. The one star is for the waitress who was attentive and polite."}
{"text":"Been well over 15 years since I've been to Red Lobster, however it's still a popular location since there aren't many of them around hence by 5pm there was a massive wait time. Coming here on Saturday for an early dinner, our dinner party of 10 at 5pm.  Their menu is quite extensive, featuring seafood specials and variety of refreshments to classic steaks and comfort food, their menu caters to many. For food I ordered their  Admirals Feast $22.99, melody of golden fried seafood, shrimp, fish and fries.  For drinks I had their 20oz Rickards Red.  One thing is for certain, I'm in love with their unlimited biscuits yum!  Overall a great place that's still attracting many who love this traditional place."}
{"text":"Came here for the yearly Endless shrimp. Being a sea food fanatic, all you can eat savory shrimp for one low price, how can you go wrong? The staff was very friendly and we were promptly seated. Didn't take them very long to have the waitress over and before you knew it, food and drinks were on our table. Overall this was an enjoyable meal and a nice red lobster!"}
{"text":"This visit was as good as any other visit to Red Lobster. The service was good as I'd expect. The food was also exactly as I'd expect. Coming from Canada I was a little surprised to see the prices were somewhat similar to Canada. I'd have expected the prices to be notably better than Canada given the exchange rate but that was not so much the case. So overall the prices were a bit higher than expected."}
{"text":"Took the kids for a birthday dinner.  This place has really gotten bad. Slow service, Steaks were over cooked. Disappointed to say the least!"}

{"text":"I had a great experience at Red Lobster in Chandler,Arizona this evening. The meal was delicious and the service with Matt was superior! Gary the manager was also extremely accommodating with the special meal request I needed. I always enjoy the consistency & deliciousness of Red Lobster meals. We'll be back  and their work perfectly on Weight Watchers plans!"}
{"text":"I had the grilled talapia it was good of course I accompanied it with the lobster bisque& lobster tail. Overall great experience good deal at 58$ for 3 people!"}
{"text":"Went to this Red Lobster and had excellent five-star wait service. The food was good, but that's not what this review was about. Caleb(?), our server, was top notch, professional, and the epitome of what a good waiter should be. He didn't interrupt our conversations - but was attentive and made sure our drinks were constantly full, we got extra biscuits and plates were cleared promptly. If only all my restaurant experiences were like what it was with Caleb last week... it's a rare thing to have such excellent service these days."}
{"text":"If I could give them zero stars I would. Worst Red Lobster I've ever been to. We had a gift card for multiple restaurants which included a photo of red lobster. I called ahead to ensure that we could use the gift card and was told yes. Upon arrival our waitress was terrible. She was short with us and seemed put out when we asked for drink refills. When the food came the order was wrong and she argued that that's what I ordered rather than fixing it she left the table. My boyfriends food had a hair in it. When we attempted to pay we were told the gift card could not be used. The on duty manager reiterated that we could not use the gift card even after I stated we called ahead. I left a review using the information on the receipt and was called by the manager several days later and was told he would speak to the waitress as well as send out a gift card. This was 2 months ago and we have yet to receive anything."}
{"text":"We went out to dinner tonight . It was me and my friend and her too little girls. She's 3 months pregnant and was craving the cheddar biscuits. They were delicious as always. Her husband is deployed right now so she's been having a hard time doing everything herself. Our server Diane was amazing and on point. Her girls really loved her outgoing personality and making sure everything was great. She brought us boxes and took amazing care of us. Thanks Diane. You were so sweet."}

{"text":"My husband and I came here yesterday for lunch.  I always wanted to grab a bite here (since forever).   I dont know what I was thinking!   The restaurant is clean, the hostess was nice, we where seated fast. Its why i give it one star ONLY  Our first server was a total d*** we were brought our drinks but threw us our straws on the table.   He also brought us the famous cheddar bay biscuits, they where deli. (4).  Our second server seemed to be rushing us. As i have never been to this restaurant. She kept asking what i will be having. She didnt even give me a min more.   My husbands plate was better and more full of shrimp then mine. By the way mine was more expensive.   He loved his plate, me on the other hand i was not satisfied. I was not full nor was it the best ive ever had.  the shrimp on my plate which their was two diff, kinds the one that was suppose to be cooked was raw.  (Someone cant tell me other wise. why, because im a shrimp lover.   I could have done a way better job myself. )    The breaded shrimp on my plate was ok.    The salad that came with my plate was gross three crutons too much dressing with a little bit off romaine lettuce.  Didnt even want too finish it   My soda ran out it took the waiter a good min. Too notice  she then a couple mins later noticed and i was brought a full soda  Our cheddar bay biscuits finished before we even got our main course.  She never brought us more.  We where totally ignored.   Even when we where done eating we had to get up and look for our own server. My husband had to go ask the hostess, she had to go look for her.   It was a total waist of time and our money. It was horrible experience.  I will NEVER come to dine here again!  Total waist once again. I will never recommend this place either  !"}
{"text":"Very great service and nice date night atmosphere. Although the food is good I think their prices are a little too high. And small selection of menu items."}

{"text":"So I might be crazy but it's January 3rd and I decided to bring the family to red lobster for dinner two of us ordered the 16.99 however the were out of the bacon baked potato which left only one option without an up charge call me crazy but I am used to a restaurant when they sell out of a product discounting the others until they get it back in stock!"}
{"text":"For me it was bad, lobster was dry and tough. There is no happy hour. Just very disappointed"}
{"text":"Tonight I had the grilled lobster shrimp and salmon And a mean lobster tail jumbo shrimp skewer salmon green beans and baby gold potatoes. Who hasn't been to red lobster?  It's always good.  Fresh seafood is not a bad way to go.  We went about an hour before closing and the restaurant was empty.  Every other time I've been it's always packed so this was a nice change of pace tonight.  Service was great as well."}
{"text":"Red Lobster can sometimes get a bad rap, but I had a blast there this past Friday night. We got there around 6:30pm and the line was out the door. No biggie as we had nothing else to do and we wanted the endless shrimp. Plus my friend had never been to a Red Lobster and it has been about 2 years since my last visit. So after waiting only about 30 mins we got seated and were on our way to pigging out.   First off, let me give a special shout out to our waitress Carina! She was very sweet and took great care of us. Thank you Carina!   So we both knew that we wanted the endless shrimp meal but being the hungry people that we are, we also ordered the appetizer that had stuffed mushrooms, fried clams, and bacon wrapped scallops. YUM! Everything came out piping hot and was very good. I mean bacon wrapped scallops. HELLO! Best of both worlds. The cheddar baked biscuits were still as good as I remembered and fresh out the oven. My friend loved them and was very excited that they brought out more once we had downed the first batch. Oh I also have to give a special mention to the Triple Berry Sangria that they now offer. WOW! Now that is some yummy sangria. Almost as good as mine (LOL) but seriously very good.   Now on to the endless shrimp, we each got to start off with two choices so I chose the teriyaki shrimp and the cajun shrimp and my friend had the garlic shrimp and the coconut shrimp bites. They both come with your standard salad and side of french fries, mashed potato, baked potato, rice or veggies. My friend bumped it up and ordered the lobster baked potato. Needless to say that was one of our favorites as well.   So back to the shrimp. OMG they were so good, and as soon as Carina bought out or dinner she asked us if we wanted to go ahead and get started on another order of shrimp so that way, but the time we may be done with our first order, more shrimp would already be on the way. She did this for us each time and I finally threw in the towel after my 2nd order but my friend ended up having about five orders. Carina let us know that our first order has ten shrimp in each dish and the orders after have about 7 or 8. Weird but hey, keeps the waste down I suppose. I was beyond stuffed when it was all said and done and very happy. The head manager came over and said hello and to make sure that we were happy with our meals. Very nice. Needless to say, it was a great time and the food was very good."}
{"text":"I ordered crab cake dinner, on the menu  it say jumbo crab cake Dinner! The person who wrote that should be fired! I was very  disappointed that when the server brought the crab cake I couldn't believe my eyes! The crab cake were mini crab cakes, red lobster should not  mislead a customer by printing jumbo crab cakes when in fact they were mini! Even my server told me they were jumbo! What makes it worst I paid $20.49 for 3 mini crab cakes rice,mash potato! If I had known what I was ordering was not what the menu says jumbo size I would have ordered lobster tail to  justify the price of $20.49! I looked at it in  disbelief  & Told my waiter this is not jumbo look how small they are & I'm glad I ordered side of crab Alfredo  linguine they server laughed too & said yea! Another word he agreed with me! I should have told him take it back I will order something else for my dollar value either bigger portion or something like lobster tail! To top of the service was very slow following on my refills & picking up empty glasses & dishes they sat there until when he brought me my check!"}

{"text":"We stopped in last night for a date night. Bobby has been working alot since his promotion and my sister has been staying with us during her college internship since we live in the city. Needless to say, we dont get too much alone time and Bobby suggested a date night which sounded perfect on a random Tuesday night. I had a gift card that could be used here, Olive Garden, Bahama breeze or Longhorn. We chose here since seafood did sound good at the time. Shout out to the person who gave me that gift card.. drinks were on you! :)  To start, we each ordered a margarita and the stuffed mushrooms. They were stuffed with lobster and seafood stuff. Not too bad. The mushrooms were small so this would be a perfect appetizer for two people.   For dinner, Bobby ordered the Snow Crab Legs which came with 1 lb of crab legs, little potatoes, corn on the cob. He got the add on as well which was an extra 1/2 lb of crab legs.  It looked delish and i also tasted some. Not bad!   I was in mood for shrimp and took advantage of the Big Shrimp Festival. You had the opportunity to choose 2 different shrimp dishes, a side + a salad for $17. I believe I could've also chosen 3 for around $20.  I ordered the shrimp scampi linguine and shrimp tempura. Both were good and the tempura came with a yummy sauce.   After another Margarita, i was stuffed!! I wanted to order the chocolate cake and ice cream so bad and contemplated it for a good 15 minutes but just couldn't handle any more food lol. Bobby ordered the Irish Coffee which was whisky and (iced?) coffee. Yum I tried it and it was amazing! The best dessert drink I've tasted in awhile.  Ali was our server and she was so sweet and friendly. Every employee we came in contact with was super nice.  Great date night."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to post a review for a couple of weeks now, but just never got around to it. We went to eat at this location for my daughter's birthday, (her choice.) We got the most amazing server, named Sidney, (hopefully I'm spelling that correctly.) Sidney greeted us warmly and upon learning that it was my daughter's birthday, she rushed around the table to hug her and wish her happy birthday. I won't detail every little thing she did, but I will say that she went above and beyond and exceeded our expectations. I hope that this review makes its way to the right person so that Sidney can get the recognition she deserves."}
{"text":"Food and cleanliness lead me to the two stars.   My coconut shrimp were greasy and scallops tasteless and overcooked. I did enjoy my baked potato.  Best part of the dining experience was our waiter Kevin. Big shout out for his friendly and attentive personality."}
{"text":"We ate there last weekend and I have not really much to complain about. The waitress was amazing and always on top. The food came out correct and tasted good. The only reason why I didn't give 5 stars is how they handelt this two black girl that try to scam them. They ordered half the menu, had alcoholic drinks and half way thru they played the manager, that they got sick. Instead of getting them on the side somewhere, we had to see and hear the whole thing. They scammed the store, just get over it and get them out as quotas possible. I really didn't wanted to listen to them how sick they are and their fake throwing up. And one more thing bothered me. We were 2 and they wanted to sit us on a table for 6. We declined, and got seated on a table for 2."}
{"text":"We have not had a bad experience here.  The staff is warm and friendly.  They've always gotten our order correct.  The food is always hot and tastes great!  We go here about once a month to every other month (it's seafood, it's pricey).  It's unfortunate that I've read some of the negative experiences here.  Nonetheless, we've enjoyed every dinner we've had here."}

Not sure why I'm even typing this since you all know how it ends... had the 'Seafood' stuffed mushroom and Lobster shrimp feast thing... 4 stars for service (Josh was awesome!) and for doing what they do well. But yeah, could've made the same meal at home with frozen food. My fault for being too lazy to drive to the Keg..."}
{"text":"I don't usually leave a review for a big chain restaurant. What's the point, but when their is a big ripoff I have to say something. We went to celebrate my birthday and the last day of school for my daughter. My wife and daughter both got the triple shrimp dinner. You get a salad, then pick your 3 kinds of shrimp. They both got shrimp and lobster pasta and two skewers of 6 shrimp each. So 12 shrimp, pasta with a bunch of shrimp and a salad for $14. Pretty good deal.  I wasn't super hungry and my daughter didn't want her salad so I decided to just get the lobster & shrimp roll off the small plate menu for $9. I though I would just get a normal lobster roll but without any sides or a salad or anything for $9. No small plate means small plate or in this case small lobster roll, really small roll (see picture). I left my thumb in for size reference. I also included the photo from the menu. In the picture you can see three small shrimp and a clump of lobster material. The roll was so small they couldn't even fit anything in it on the one end. You can see the little shrimp can't even fit inside. These weren't the bigger shrimp like on the skewers, these were the small ones like in the pasta. Four bites and it's done. Didn't even taste that great, kinda bland, needed a little salt. Really really not worth 9 bucks. I could see In 'n Out from my seat and kept thinking I could have feasted for half the price."}
{"text":"Where do I begin...lets start with a one hour wait in the lobby, AFTER being told \"about a 30min\" and the excuse we were given was there was no one to buss the tables...while we stood there and saw several of the employees standing up front in the lobby with us in groups talking...so we get seated, 1 appetizer took (not bullshitting) 30min...we ordered two but the server came back and said they were out of the shrimp for the second appetizer we ordered but 15min after telling us that, the server returns with the other appetizer we ordered and says \"I apologize they lied to me in the kitchen\" wow so now the cooks are lying to the servers okay....so me and my girlfriend order a meal which in the photo shows mushrooms (which Iam allergic to) however fails to mention that the meal contains mushrooms in the description....the meals we order are new and the server does tell us he doesn't know much about them, but whatever is listed should be in them We order the meals without mushrooms which he wrote on the cook slip (he showed us) so there should not have been a problem...wrong they bring us the meals with mushrooms...then have to remake them, however failed to mention that it would no longer come with the 3cheese and lobster sauce on top...so after having waited an additional 15 min on the manager who was NO help she basically blames everything on the server (who was new) but he did nothing wrong but relay the messages he was given...long story short the rest of our party got there meals and ate them and was getting boxes by the time our meals came out......don't waste your time here spend the extra time driving to a better location if you truly want red lobster....unprofessionally run establishment."}
{"text":"We have come to this location on numerous occasions and have always had great service followed by great food. We came here for lunch and we were treated rudely right off the bat. They open at 11am. We arrived at 11:15 am only because we had to be somewhere. We walked in. Nobody was there to greet us. We stood around for five minutes until I walked into the seating area and a waitress who we had seen already and who saw us too but didn't pay any mind, almost walked pass us again. I asked her if it was open yet...maybe we got the time wrong and we would've been okay with that and she said, \"Yes, do you want a seat?\" But all with attitude. I felt like saying, \"No. We just wanted to stand around and look around\". Ugh. As we followed her I asked my boyfriend if anyone else was here and she chimed in (again with attitude), \"Nobody is here!\". She seated us, dropped our menu's off and walked away. She came back asking what we wanted to drink and I asked what they had on tap. She looked at me, again with the same attitude and said, \"Lots!\".  I then proceeded to have a conversation with my boyfriend in front of her asking him if he wanted to leave...we were both made to feel extremely uncomfortable and I looked at her and asked again what was on tap. She busted out the list of beers on tap like a champ and before she left I asked for her manager. We were provided with a new waiter and he was the bomb and the manager came to apologize and I explained to the manager what had happened. We weren't looking for anything but respect. We were looking forward to having a relaxing lunch and we should've left after being seated but we stook it out because the next waiter was so helpful and happy and smiley. Why that lady even had a job there is beyond me. Customer service is key!!"}
{"text":"I only re-write reviews seldom as they typically don't need to be updated. My party and I came here last weekend. We made reservations for a certain time, and upon arrival were told a large group currently had out table and we would have to wait. We ended up having to wait 30 minutes past our reservation to be seated. To make up for it, they told us we could order some apps for the table for free, which was very nice of them.  Our service was pretty good, only a few blips with orders being incorrect, but with a large group it can happen. One of my guests experienced something that'll stop him from ever coming back. Upon chewing his rice, he felt something hard in his mouth, spit it out into his hand to discover that it was a PIECE OF GLASS. No joke.  We immediately called a manager over who was very professional about it, apologized profusely and immediately comped his meal. He was offered another meal but declined. He was also given a gift card as an apology, he ended up giving it to me because he says he won't be coming back. I can't say I blame him because I can only imagine what might have happened if he has swallowed said piece of glass....  The food here is delicious but this incident may have effected a few of my guests from returning. Bad news here people... if a glass breaks in a kitchen anywhere remotely near any food.. all said food should be thrown out. Obviously."}
{"text":"This is a seafood sit down restaurant that serves a variety of dishes but I mostly come for the shrimp.  I got the shrimp platter with 3 different styles (shrimp pasta, skewer, and fired). They have very good cheddar bay biscuits that come in the begging of your meal. This place is never busy any more. It isn't expensive but isn't cheap either. 3 stars."}
{"text":"The last few times I've been to Red Lobster, the food has been pretty bad. On this particular night, we decided to go because my boyfriend had a $25 gift card. The gift card helped with the cost, but dinner was still around $30 out of pocket (and that's with their new 4 courses for $14.99) deal and no alcohol.   We decided to order an appetizer (calamari) and that was the best thing we ate all night! The new england clam chower soup was a joke!! It was really watery and I found myself having to add salt and pepper for more flavor. I didn't even finish it and new england clam chowder is my favorite soup!!  Next was a caesar salad, which was good. For my entree, I had the grilled honey BBQ shrimp. I was really unimpressed and thought it was bland. For dessert, I had the brownie. It was a good portion size for the amount of food I had already eaten and tasted good.  At this location, I felt uncomortable with our server. He never looked at my boyfriend when he came to our table and was coming over to check on us constantly to see if we needed anything. It was annoying and distracted my boyfriend and I from any conversation we were having at the time. We still tipped him well but both felt uncomfortable.  Needless to say, I will not be venturing to Red Lobster anytime soon. I feel as though there are much better seafood places for a better or more reasonable price."}
{"text":"Omg we ate here last night. Its been 3 years since we've been to a red lobster and I'm happy to see they did not disappoint! It is a lot lot of food though. Couldn't believe they have crusted talapia for under 600 calories. Which was good bc I defense tore up the cheese biscuits. But really who goes to red lobster without tearing up the biscuits. Eric was our server and he was really nice and suggested so many options for us... He's an asset to red lobster for sure :)"}
{"text":"I have eaten at this Red Lobster for years. Recently things have slipped. Yesterday a group of us had dinner. One person ordered the fish and chips. What came was batter, no fish. Two us is had Cobb salads, poor...the lettuce was frozen in both salads. Needless to say this place needs a major over haul. The only good thing about this restaurant is the server Mary who is stellar. Too may other places to eat."}
{"text":"Really nice ambience and the food was great too. Stuffed mushrooms, shrimp alfredo and the chocolate stuffed cookie were my favorite. Service was excellent too."}
{"text":"We had dinner here for the first time tonight. Have heard lots of good reports. We had lobster dinner on the table in less than 20 minutes. Food was good, service was excellent. I would definitely come back and recommend this restaurant to friends."}
{"text":"Most of the time we've been pleased when we visited this Red Lobster.  Every once in awhile, the food was iffy.  But, they've always made up for it by giving a discount, free gift card, etc.  My daughter and I enjoy coming to this restaurant.  My favorite is the New Orleans salmon and shrimp.  Delicious!  I always have to fight with myself to not eat too many cheddar biscuits.  Not sure what was or is going on with this Red Lobster.  Used to be crowded all the time.  Not so much anymore.  I really want them to succeed.  I've been going to Red Lobster for 30+ years.  Love the variety and it's generally affordable depending, of course, on what you order."}
{"text":"The seating hostess was not at the stand for a few minutes, so we waited. She sat us at a spacious table. The waitress brought another table's entrees to us. My scallops tasted bland. The crab cake had much meat. The crab legs were cooked properly. The rice tasted good. The broccoli appeared to have moldy spots on it. I got a refill of water. The bill was brought out quickly."}
{"text":"This is the worst red lobster in town. Once we came in no one greeted us. This girl seemed like she was having a bad day. Then we got this waiter Trey.. he was really nice and kept checking on us constantly. The bad thing was the food was cold. Clam chowder was cold, and the baked potato was even baked. We waited for the manager for a good 20 minutes, and he finally showed up. He took 4 dollars out of the bill.. seriously? Four dollars? Overall, I would suggest to never come to this location unless you like cold food."}
{"text":"Service is good.. Food is terrible. Low quality, bad preparation....  If the quality to price was more in line I would've given it a higher rating because I don't generally have high expectations for chains but in this case I just don't think the value is there."}
{"text":"Excellent loberfest!Went on the last day of lobster fest for dads birthday.  Our meals were the best I ever had.  I had three lobster tails, green beans, baked potato and caprese salad.  He had two tails, 5 scallops, corn on cob, green beans and baked potato.  Everything was cooked perfectly.  This food was every bit as good as high end restaurants with $75 tails.  The server, he was excellent also.   I am a food snob , and very particular,so this is a big compliment to Red Lobter!"}
{"text":"Went there for dinner with my husband. We got seated promptly. Our waitress was pleasant and friendly and very attentive. My husband and I ordered the Surf and Turf. The steaks had no flavor. The Lobster tails were dry and rubbery. We couldn't finish it because the dinner was so awful. We won't be going back which is sad because I love seafood."}
{"text":"Boyfriend and I celebrated our anniversary last night here at Red Lobster. Even at peak dinner hours they were able to seat us right away. Our server was Brendon and he was great. I couldn't decide on what to drink even though I knew what I would eat, and he was able to recommend something I didn't even know I would like, but I loved it! When the food came out it was piping hot and everything tasted fresh and delicious. I had the Bar Harbor Lobster Bake, and it was teeming with different types of shellfish, just like the ocean served over pasta! Boyfriend had the pick three option with the Skampi (came with 2 full ramicans), Shrimp Alfredo, and a peppercorn sirloin. He cleaned his plate, which he never does, and even for a seafood joint his steak was cooked perfectly.  Wish we had saved room for dessert! But we only splurge on dinner once or twice a year, so we stuffed ourselves with seafood (and in his case steak) and had a great time. Thanks Red Lobster!"}
{"text":"Excellent service, food and atmosphere! Got here on a busy Friday night at 6:30 and it was packed, was told a 50 minute wait...Ouch but they got us seated in about 35 minuets (Yay) Our waitress Mariam was a excellent waitress, very tentative and kept checking on us throughput the evening. We got the Surf and Turf and an order of Lobster Tacos (Lobster Fest) so we had to get Lobster  the food was excellent and their cheddar bay biscuits were great...fresh and hot!!"}
{"text":"I have been to many red lobsters before and usually enjoy the food. This was the first one that we have had to wait for a seat, although it was not to long. This place seemed overwhelmed with the crowd. The food was not prepared well. The shell of the crab legs were spongy and bent with the crackers. The baked potato was awful and the service was mediocre. I will not be back to this location"}
{"text":"My daughter sent me a gift card for Red Lobster so we just had to go (been awhile) and my wife and I were so glad we did. The cheddar bay biscuits were worth the trip alone!!! We both had shrimp and the wife had a steak as well. The service was top notch. Only had a mix up of the check at the end...but he apologized and took care of the problem right away."}
{"text":"First time coming to this Red Lobster. The environment was nice, the service was great! Our server was JUSTIN. He was attentive, filled our drinks as soon as they were below half and was very helpful. He had a few tables and he still managed to give amazing service! Thanks Justin, for making our first time at your restaurant a good one. Btw....Lobster is delicious, so is the garlic shrimp!"}
{"text":"Shak is the best waiter EVER!  Our food was perfect and my wine glass was never dry.  From the time that we sat down till our food came was only about 20 minutes."}
{"text":"Awful. The shrimp was undercooked and overcooked at the same time. I felt that I lost about 5 years of my life just coming here. The vegetables were dry and tasteless. There are so many better seafood places in Toronto. This is not one of them."}
{"text":"I'd been looking for a quick stop for some seafood so stopped here and got some things to go. I was disappointed to find that there were no crab cakes on the menu and they are only available seasonal according to the bartender who took my order. BTW, he's the main reason I give this 5 stars and would take a star away for the hostess who when I asked if I could order to go food she just said \"you have to do that at the bar\", no offer of a menu, which I saw directly in front of her and there were also to-go menus on the podium. She wasn't the hostess with anything close to the mostess. Lucas at the bar however more than made up for her lack of efforts in customer service. He was quick to take my order and was great at suggestions for additions to what I'd wanted to order. Definitely made the brief stop here more enjoyable."}
{"text":"In a good location on the Westside of Las Vegas just south of the 95 freeway on Decatur. It's a combination of factors that make this chain less than stellar. On the positive side, the new menu provides small plates featuring lobster roll, seafood tacos and some Chinese dishes. The best values are soup or salad with traditional menu dishes. The steak and grilled shrimp include a vegetable and potatoes. The food is tasty but rarely cooked perfectly. On the downside the music is loud and often inappropriate. Moving tables requires one to drag one's own drinks and silverware to the new location. Finally, they don't take reservations till an hour before you eat. Depending on the time you choose, you might have to wait. But not a bad value for a chain."}
{"text":"I know what to expect from a Red Lobster, having eaten in quite a few before. For the most part, this one lived up to that expectation. Delicious cheddar bay biscuits, decent drinks, and ton's of affordable seafood.   What brought them down to 2 stars then?  Fruit Flies. After killing 3 between the two of us, we saw numbers 4 and 5 (at least) buzzing around. Frigging disgusting. Eat here at your own risk."}
{"text":"Once a year for a long time I have looked forward to the lobster specials during LobsterFest at Red Lobster. Since I am retired, living on Social Security, this is only a yearly treat. Every year, for a long time, I have been more than happy with my lobster dinner here. This year it was different, unfortunately.  We chose to go for Sunday dinner becausee we felt we'd get the freshest food then. That may have been correct, but as you'll see, when I got my food, freshness was difficult to tell. This year, I started with a mohito, which was completely un-drinkable it was so bitter. Instead of muddling the mint, the bartender had apparently muddled a slice of lime, skin and all. I added sugar, then artificial sweetener. Nothing could remove the bitterness. I ended up leaving the drink almost untouched on the table when we left.  The salad with Ranch dressing was good. I had the Lobster Lovers Dream, which has both rock lobster and Maine lobster tails, plus baby shrimp with pasta. I was sooo sad to find that both of the lobster tails were \"hammered\", so over-cooked as to make it difficult to cut through them with a table knife (which was all they gave me). I hated to ask for a re-cook, since my waiter could barely slow down from a dead run. I don't know if that was his choice or his employer's. But it served to keep us from asking for a re-do of my lobster plate because we felt sorry for him. I probably should have saved that pity for us, since the overall meal was so bad. I will remember in the future, tho', that a good wait person would notice if you're not eating or drinking & they would ask what was wrong. He never noticed anything. He was determined to move as quickly as he could, whatever the reason was...the sign of a bad waiter. A good waiter(ress) might be interested in racking up as many tips as he/she can, but their customer would never know it. The customer is made to feel they are the wait person's main priority. Not so here. It was a sad day for Lobster fest in Gastonia."}
{"text":"Crab Alfredo my favorite!That is until they put spoonfuls of garlic in the mix. 57 yr old first bad one. FYI they changed all their recipes. Before you order ask. Manager explained if you don't want spoonfuls of garlic you must specify that. I'll remember next time to let the cook know spoonfuls of garlic chunks in every bite - maybe not. I guess common sense was not at play."}
{"text":"I love Red Lobster however it is hit or miss depending on the location.  This one is not good.  It was trashy and the food was awful. Tip for management.   Tell your staff to take pride in the way they look. Dirty clothes, shoes,wrinkled, just dirty looking people in general.  Shrimp was over breaded, biscuits had a weird tastes, green beans under cooked, lobster under cooked, the rice was good!  I could tell the kitchen staff needs to be retrained   $100 meal and it was shitty.  Disappointed. Will not be back"}
{"text":"I can't believe Red Lobster would put their name on this place. It has to be the worst Red Lobster I have ever been in across the USA. I have been in a lot of them. They told us it would be a 30 to 45-minute wait. I was standing by the front door looking at a bunch of empty tables ( maybe 20 or 25 of them)  While waiting I went to the restroom, waking by tons of EMPTY tables. Then there were 5 servers standing in the back talking to each other. Saw more EMPTY tables. I come out of the restroom and the same 5 servers were still standing there talking. On the way back to the front I saw MORE EMPTY tables. While waiting up front 5 more servers came up to the Hostess desk to start their conversations. Nobody was doing any work or taking care of guess. NEVER WILL I COME BACK HERE!!!!"}
{"text":"Most of my Red Lobster experiences have been in the states and I found it to be a generally great experience. My father also brings home take out from this location and he's brought home on many the occasion the rock lobster and shrimp combo. As the lobster was superbly cooked on those days I felt that it was a safe bet to go with the steak and Rock Lobster, which at $39.99 was their most expensive item on the menu and I had hoped that it would reflect the quality. I was proven very, very wrong.  The rock lobster tail was so overcooked that it had a rubbery and incredibly unpleasant texture... I would compare it to a rubber band for reference. It was horribly overcooked and unappetizing. The steak had the texture of gum, with such a foul smell and putrid after taste that after two bites of the questionable item before me, I was unable to continue the meal. I didn't have the biscuits, because I didn't want to fill up on unnecessary salty and overly buttered, greasy bread before my meal (as I would never have been able to finish anything) so I can't attest to the quality of that food item, but my boyfriend does relay that it was enjoyable, albeit just as overly buttered and very salty as I had suspected. I will say that the Caesar salad was quite enjoyable, as was the alcoholic beverages that I tried. I had the Peach Long Island Iced Tea as well as the Malibu Hurricane and I found both to be quite pleasant and refreshing.  Will I eat here again? The answer is a resounding NO. Might I go here for casual drinks, perhaps... but I highly doubt it.  The manager on duty was kind enough to remove the item from my bill, and I think it was because it was painfully obvious that I took a very small cut from the lobster tail and a small strip off the steak. Even with his offer of dessert or another meal, I completely declined everything, as I felt absolutely sick to my stomach from the steak and told him in earnest, that I was now quite afraid to order anything else. I unfortunately still feel quite nauseated from the steaks after taste and I am truly confused as to what I was served.  Those with allergies be aware:- they do cook the seafood on the same grill as the steak and chicken, so if you have an allergy where you're risking anaphylaxis if you have seafood, this is unfortunately not the place for you... because they cannot accommodate you with most items. I was fairly annoyed to be told this after that individual had placed their order (and we had three meals out already) because I had called on Thursday and spoken to staff who assured me that accommodations would always be made for allergies of this nature. Many thoughts would be... why would anyone with a seafood allergy want to come here? They were given a gift card and wanted the opportunity to try the establishment, so it was a bit unfortunate that they were relegated to very basic fare.   For those that do wish to try this establishment:- I would suggest going on a day that they are not busy and that they don't have their shrimp event going, because they seem completely incapable of dealing with a full house. I feel the food quality really suffered because of how busy they were. I could understand where staff would become overwhelmed and absolutely butcher the food beyond any salvageable level, because I have eaten here before and the other occasions weren't such a disaster.  I will say after I sent back the meal, I was pretty much invisible/dead to the servers and that was quite amusing... because we generally leave about 20- 30% tip, but due to this they got their designated 15% as we were a party off 10 and it was automatically added. The server also skipped the tip menu and stated, well no one ever bothers to up the tip because it's already included on a party. And I honestly didn't care enough to even put the extra $ in cash as we normally would, because I didn't enjoy their service nor their food. Lol  There's certainly room for improvement, but considering the shabby exterior and the equally basic staff... I don't really see this happening."}
{"text":"It's always tough writing a review for a franchise restaurant in my opinion. Why you ask . Well they're generally all the same wether it's with decor to food items on the menu or quality . But here goes for this Sherway location . The Red lobster menu is actually pretty extensive . There is alot of seafood choices and a few surf and turf style ones .  I had the steak and lobster tail .  It was pretty tasty the steak I mean for a seafood establishment. I asked for it to be cooked rare but it came back more medium then rare ..it's ok little hiccup I still ate it . The lobster tail was a little small aswell but maybe that's what you get for $40  If your coming with a date / significant other  Expect to pay over $100 easy for a dinner of 2 and that's without alcohol . They have some great seafood platters though and some nice cocktail choices aswell . There's alot of older people here and families aswell . So other than paying $50 for my steak being over cooked with a small lobster tail  The place is alright ...it's clean and quiet and staff is pretty friendly."}
{"text":"Had a great server named Carlos, very friendly and attentive. Enjoyed my meal. Love their lobster and artichoke dip... created my own combo... shrimp scampi, steak and alfredo... delish. That meal with my sides alloted me dinner that night and enough left overs for dinner the next day."}
{"text":"I don't get the excitement over these darn biscuits, they aren't good at all. I've been here a few times, food it OK, and prices are OK, but I'm not impressed."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here for the first time and it was great!  The server name was Alex and he was very helpful and friendly. We ordered the mussels for appetizer and it was amazing. The crab and shrimp was great but the lobster was a little tough.  The staff was helpful and we're Definitely returning when we get a chance"}
{"text":"I treated my Mom to dinner for Mothers Day. We had no problems getting a parking space . I was quite impressed when that little \"your seat is ready\" notification thingamabob began vibrating within 3 minutes.   I'm  a creature of habit and my ol stand by order is the Ultimate feast. But I decided to take a chance on something new.  In regards to RL, this was actually  was more like a tight rope walking across the grand canyon type of risk. Ive had several less than positive experiences with RL recently.  I've  even referred  to RL as the golden arches of sea food.  I was fully prepared to write another sarcastic two star  review. So i was kinda disappointed when my entree  was .. ( wait for it. Drum rolls) cough actually quite enjoyable! I decided to go with the wood grilled scallops, Shrimp and lobster. I highly recommend trying it.   Not as impressed with desserts. They  were out of both key lime pie  and strawberry cheese cake.  And the molten Cookie doesn't even begin  to compare to my  discontinued fudge overboard brownie."}
{"text":"Nice meal, very cheerful bartender- she was pleasant to everyone she spoke with"}
{"text":"This Red Lobster has been at this location in the Atrium on Bay forever. This restaurant has a nice, comfortable bar facing Bay Street, though the last time I visited the bar smelled awfully hoppy. The service in the bar is great. The table service the night I was there recently was not good--missing cutlery and napkin, slow to order a drink, slow to see the salads and entrees, and we weren't asked if we wanted a second drink or dessert.  The food was decent. The buns, as has already been established, are deliciously salty. The caesar salad was passable and the garden salad looked like something you might see at a seniors restaurant. The crab was very well prepared. The shrimp and scallops were oversauced and really salty, but decent.  I'll go back. I know what I'm getting and I'm okay with that, and it's not bad at about $40 a person for a decent amount of seafood (assuming you get one of the specials and don't order something silly in this seafood restaurant such as chicken) and a drink, including tax and tip."}
{"text":"What a disappointment!  I don't even want to do this review!  When we first arrived, there was a lot of  people waiting to be seated.  So when we got to the hostess, she took our name, and we decided to sit and have a drink.  As were sitting there, we noticed there were plenty of seats available.  I guess they want you to think there that busy...DUHHHH, I can see all the tables that are clean and available!  What ever!  So we get called for our table about 15 min later.   As I'm looking at the menu, nothing really looked good to me!  Well except for the stuffed mushrooms, and a lobster pizza!  I went with the mushrooms, they were really good.  There biscuits seemed too salty!  Wow, I like some seasoning on my food, but DAYMMMM!   Since we really didn't seem that hungry (I think the menu just turned us off)  We decided to do the 2 for $25.00 Bad choice.  I got the seafood linguini, ughhhh, like I could have made this at home!  There was nothing special about this it wasn't even worth $3.99l  My husband ordered Honey Garlic Crispy Shrimp!  Ummm, when you say crispy, your expecting some crunch, right?  His shrimp was soggy, and the rice was weird, I love rice!  I didn't even like it!    I will be back, because there lunch menu seems so much better!  Not only that, I should have just gotten the lobster pizza!  This will be my last visit, if they don't have there game on point!"}
{"text":"Almost 1 year later and no follow up or acknowledgment from Red Lobster from my review? Figures....."}
{"text":"best restaurant around this area!  I love their crab cakes my waitress Michael was very attentive with my refills , the management seems ti know what they're doing"}
{"text":"They usually have two prices for food options, lunch and dinner. Since it's a bit heavy in terms of the portions and the ingredients, we usually come here for lunch. The lunch price is lower and it is very competitive in the markets.   The waitresses are always friendly. They usually ask for what occasion for the meal and what special they would like to suggest. After taking our orders, the waitress served us the cheese biscuits. The taste is light but the smell is so good to be one of the appetizers to start with.   My partner ordered the Atlantic salmon with the mashed potato as the side. The salmon is well-cooked, it's soft and juicy. The mashed potato looks plain without any gravy, but it tastes flavourful tho. My order was the chicken and the shrimp skewer. Again, the seasonings on the shrimps delight its flavour. I was surprised how juicy the chicken was made.   With one dish for each person, the lunch was filling. The price wasn't even expensive for the meals including the salmon, shrimps and salmon. We will definitely come here again for other choices."}
{"text":"I ate here with my wife recently.  She loves seafood, and we had a gift card.  So why not give it a shot.  Surprisingly, we didn't have to wait long to get our seats.  We were given the standard spiel with the current promotion \"lobsterfest\".  And boy, were they selling it hard.  I know the servers have to do it, but I found it annoying.  We ordered some waters with lemon.  Water arrive promptly w/o lemon.  No big deal.  Wife gets shrimp 3 ways.  I get a steak and salmon meal.  We both ordered Caesar salads.  I've never had a salad with more bad lettuce than what was brought to me.  At least half the lettuce was wilted and dark green/black slimy looking.  I told the server and he promptly brought out a different house salad.  It was fine, but the kitchen should know never to send anything out looking like that.  Our meals took a long time to arrive.  Must have been a good 40 minutes.  The food was decent enough.  My steak was rather bland.  But the salmon was good.  My wife enjoyed her shrimp.  When the bill came, it said waters w/ lemon.  Everyone has off days, I get it.  A number of points during the experience rubbed me the wrong way.  I thought Red Lobster was going through a re-branding recently.  But it seemed like the same tired interior and menu from the last time I ate at one 4 years ago."}
{"text":"May 26, 2018...still NO contact from Red Lobster! Obviously, they didn't and still don't care! I'll be contacting corporate and advise of the results. Money over quality.  June 2, 2018...Finally, Mona the manager called and apologized and offered the typical 'come back ON US gift card'."}
{"text":"There is no chance in hell that this place deserves anything above 2.  Have any of you actually had real seafood? Or is Captain Highliner frozen fish sticks all you had growing up?  I give this 2 and not 1 star because of their biscuits.   That is the only thing good about this place.  I don't understand the lineups and wait time?  Do you people think this food is healthier?  Go see the sodium content of your food.   Each and everyone of you that give this place 3 and above need a lobotomy."}
{"text":"Worst experience at armed lobster yet. My wife got the 4 course entree..clam chowder was bland..Caesar salad was ok..coconut shrimp was burnt and barely any meat..I got the grilled shrimp which came out raw. Our server was ok, but lacked attentiveness which was the same as the \"manager\" whom was not sincere when brought to their attention. They took off my meal which I did not eat but there were no check backs on the meal my wife didn't  eat as to why. Horrible manager, horrible service..I thought I would give corporate office 24 hours to respond to my concerns and still have not heard back from them."}
{"text":"Awful. Terrible. Just not my style. I couldn't not get over how packed this place was and how crappy it was. The seafood plates are like minuscule. The commercials make the seafood look big and delicious and the shrimps were so tiny! Those biscuits that are their signature...terrible. Fatty dough balls that people were devouring. I did get a decent sized glass of wine though but I won't go back!"}
{"text":"They have great alcoholic drinks. Quite a good variety. Sunset is my favorite. We went their for crab fest and I ordered the new crab legs. It was sooooo dry and tasteless. It was supposed to be sweet. Very disappointed.  My husband ordered the fried shrimp which was good. Sad the waiter even suggested the crab legs."}
{"text":"I took my daughter here for a father and daughter date and our server Sydney was simply one of a kind.  Sydney was so nice and caring and made our experience simply amazing.  I can only hope that Red Lobster recognize that they have a true Gem working for their company."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of Red Lobster and Seafood in general. The staff was very friendly and courteous. It was a pretty standard ambiance for the Red Lobster restuarant franchise which unfortunately isn't very impressive but lucky the food makes up for it. It wasn't very busy at this time so it would have been disappointing if it wasn't up to standards but it was so back to the good stuff. We got the Crab Linguini Alfredo, Rock Lobster Tail, Snow Crab Legs, and Garlic Shrimp Scampi... And everything was absolutely amazing! It was the kind of meal that put me right to bed after :)"}
{"text":"Corporate dining at its finest.  First I want to comment on our server.  He was the best!  Attentive and informative; but he was never intrusive.  My lobster/shrimp, snow crab combo was very good.  However, the broccoli was terrible.  My wife had lobster tacos.  Which she said were very good, albeit the taco shells were borderline stale.  The cheesy biscuits were what I expected.  They are good!  After having coconut shrimp for an appetizer, a salad and a couple of those biscuits, I was borderline full.  Then came my combo.  It was good enough (disregarding the broccoli) that I found ample room to pack it all down.  Due to timing, we walked into the restaurant and were seated immediately.  I realize that Red Lobster is a chain; but they do a pretty good job of serving decent sea food.  We left happy."}
{"text":"Very poor service. I came in for a take out order had to wait about 5-7 minutes on an almost empty night for someone to attend. I had a pretty simple online order, 4 course feast and one appetizer  They missed the main entree completely. 15.99 for a salad , brownie, and a puddle of clam chowder.  Been a pretty big fan of red lobster from back home on the west coast. but this one is subpar."}
{"text":"Two words.... ...food poisoning The service is mediocre... And the decor is sort of cheap and nasty. The employees do Their job by serving the customer. They may hate their lives. But they get the job done."}
{"text":"Red Lobster has been around for a long time.  It has reinvented itself several times, accounting for changing tastes.  It has been the big chain restaurant that has delivered sea food to the middle class, especially in middle America.  Can you find fresher, better tasting seafood?  Yes, either closer to the ocean or for at least twice the price.  The best deals you can find are the seasonal specials.  They are usually good sized, with variety, not always fried.  Appetizers are interesting, with variety.  Salads are basic.  Their cheddar biscuits are somewhat legendary.  The service at this location was a bit slow, but they were very busy.  Food was well prepared.  Overall, good experience.  Good place to go if you crave seafood at a decent price."}
{"text":"Once you get past the biscuits and salads, the menu selections are pretty bland.  The seafood just does not taste fresh.  Items well prepared, but many are heavily sauced or fried.  Service was friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"CRABFEST SCORE!!! Went in tonight with my hubby for my birthday dinner. Our server was a sweet young blonde lady. I wish I remembered her name because she was amazing! (I'm so horrible with names..grrrr)  Started with a peach tea! So refreshing and tasty. Of course we got those amazing cheddar biscuits. Light crisp on the outside and steamy soft goodness in the center. Those biscuits will beat any diet will power, I don't care who you are!   We both got the ultimate feast with a lobster tail, king crab legs, shrimp scampi, and sub the breaded shrimp for coconut shrimp. Everything was cooked to perfection and HUGE portions. I'm at the point now where I hate myself for eating so much but in the moment... it just felt so right!   It was my birthday so they brought out a scoop of ice cream that said happy birthday which was tasty. Perfect to share since we were both so full already.   Overall everything was great from the food to the service. Not one thing I would of changed. I feel like the prices are very fair medium range for a huge crab/lobster dish. Any other place would of been outrageous for the amount of food we got. Looking forward to coming back!"}
{"text":"Good food and always good customer service. Great place to go get some crab or lobster. Cheddar biscuits they put on table are delicious!!!!"}
{"text":"Red Lobster appears to be one on the larger chains that gets it!  Reasonable seafood at a reasonable price.  Their Sweet Chili Shrimp app is the greatest. Many others try a sweet chili thing, but most just don't measure up.  Scallops, King Crab, others terrific.  The biscuits and salad are always spot on.  They still don't know how to cook a lobster which is truly annoying given their name (always over cooked) but most everything else works.   My spouse always has the fresh fish of the day and that also is always great.   Priced significantly better than most of the other seafood restaurants in town."}
{"text":"Wait staff is friendly and food is decent.  However, wait times for food are a bit long at times and food is on the saltier side.  Came here yesterday with my brother for lunch and our food took almost an hour to come.  However, our server kept us updated on our orders, apologized for making us wait and even threw in a free dessert because of that!   I like the many choices on the menu and the lunch combos are affordable.  Would be nice if the other items were not so expensive!  Good experience, otherwise."}
{"text":"Fantastic! I know that this isn't really a find but...it was so good! Red lobster is a chain but as we all know just because its a chain doesn't mean they all provide the same quality of service! But this was really good... It was picture perfect! Everyone was nice and the food was hot and tasted like it did in the test kitchen! I no longer eat meat which includes sea food but I still enjoyed my meal I had pasta and a salad (they also has other vegitarian friendly sides)...all in all it was a fun night!.."}
{"text":"For being a land locked state, there are not a lot of seafood options. That being said, it's not bad. It's not fancy at all and the average age is in the 60's. My wife and I still like to come. We can usually split something and leave satisfied."}
{"text":"Yummy! I'm not a huge lobster fan but they sold me on it. I got lobster pasta and did not regret as it was absolutely delicious! My hubby got the lobster special and enjoyed it too.  We will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"All the times I went they were nice and service was great me and my girlfriend ordered drinks on Father's Day they were exceptional mine was strong I ordered the Long Island ice tea"}
{"text":"The service here was fast and efficient they were nice and clean.our appetizer was out in minutes and our food came as soon as we ordered."}
{"text":"It's a chain. What more can I say. The food is ok. A fine place to go after work if you're hungry for seafood. But not classy enough to bring a date.   And they commit the ultimate Italian sin, putting cheese on seafood! But that's easy to avoid, since there are lots of menu choices.  If you get the live lobster, make sure you get the same one you selected from the tank. I insisted on a female lobster (since the tail is thicker and I love the roe.) Server took the female lobster to the kitchen. Then I got served... A male lobster.  Overall I would go here mostly for the yummy fried clams and stuff like that. It's really not bad if you crave the Americanized seafood."}
{"text":"Friendly and attentive staff.  Restaurant location is good. Plenty of parking.  Ambience is relaxed and casual.  Food sucked. The commercials do this chain too much justice. Either up the food quality or downgrade your commercials."}
{"text":"My husband and our 3 kids went to this location and we had a great time. Ryan our server was excellent. He was on top of everything we needed and was great with our kids. He was a great server and we hope to have him again at our next Visit. Please give him kudos when you see him. =)"}
{"text":"4 stars because I only really come here for the endless shrimp special and never once did I feel judged for shoving a ridiculous amount of shrimp down my throat.   Their lava chocolate chip dessert is one of my favorite treats in town and it's so good it's almost never in stock. If they have it, try it! It's delicious."}
{"text":"We went there last night.  It was not very busy only 1 other couple waiting. We asked for a table because my wife is in a walking cast and it makes it much easier for her to sit.  We waited over 30 min and 12 -14 people being seated while we waited. We told the hostess to change it to any seating. They called us about 5 min later and surprise it was a table. The server got to us and took our drink order but it took 15 min to get a cup of coffee, \"It was being made\" the rest of the meal was just ok. The food was alright but not spectacular. The service was alright, he did screwup and brought an extra salad bur we were not charged for it. Won't be one of my first choices in the future."}
{"text":"We enjoy going for the crab. It is priced reasonably and the service is always pretty good. This location is always busy which means it must be good. They always have food specials or create your own dinners which is nice."}
{"text":"I usually don't rate fast food since it's harder to give a rating given the price, expectation and quality.  With Red Lobster, I'd say... if you're looking for cheap seafood and you're okay with it not being the best quality, than Red Lobster is your place! They have all seafoods, quality is good GIVEN the price, and the quantity is good as well.  What sets Red Lobster apart is that MUFFIN that they bring out to everyone. OMG."}
{"text":"Second time eating at red lobster just because I was invited for dinner. Would never come back. First the food was definitely way saltier than it should've been (just like many other reviews have said). The waiter brought the wrong side order for me and he seemed very rushed in doing things. He was so rushed that all of the things he did would come off as very rude. Plates were thrown in front of you and drinks would be slammed down on the tabled with the straw just flying around. Overall I wasn't satisfied with the service nor the food."}
{"text":"Went for a friends birthday.  Our waitress Diane did an outstanding job and the food was very good. We had a lobster  entree. We ended with a desert called the \"chocolate wave\", with a chorus of Happy Birthday.  We had a great time!!"}
{"text":"Awesome service and food! Amber our server was great! The food came out hot and fresh and in a timely manner! We ordered Long Island ice teas and they were made just right!"}
{"text":"We got seated quickly, but waited 15min to place our drink order. In the meantime, a group got seated next to us, they were greeted them, follewed by another server telling th about their \"team service\".... Too bad we didn't get any of that team service'!  We ordered the crab crusted tilipia, they forgot the broccoli (and when they bring it, it tasted like rubber), the dish was disappointing! They were nice enough to take it off the bill. Overall the service was poor and food was sub par, I hadn't been to Red Lobster is some years and not I remeber why. Next time I'm in that area, i'lll choose to go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Food was good. Service started out good but then became less and less... good. He was there to help us fill drinks, took our orders, refilled our endless shrimp, etc but when we gave him the money for the check, he pretty much disappeared with it. We sat there for probably 20 minutes and never saw him walk by again. Had to ask another waiter where he was with our change and when he came back, he said \"I thought you didn't want change\". Really. No way we were tipping you $50, bro."}
{"text":"I went to the endless shrimp special at this location on Labor Day.   The waitress was friendly and the food came quickly. I tried all the shrimp dishes and each was as tasty as the last. The food was well prepared and hot when it arrived.   I would recommend this location to anyone visiting the CU area. Great staff, great food!"}
{"text":"First off there were 14 of us for my girlfriend's pap's 88th birthday and the service was great! They let us bring in an outside cake and they still sang to him. Our food came out all together which was a plus. Refills were promptly handled as well!  I got the surf and turf (lobster tail and sirloin steak) with french fries and broccoli as the sides.    The lobster tail was good, but had a lil bit of a rubber texture, but it tasted good, very sweet.    I ordered my steak medium-rare and it was overcooked just a little too much, but still juicy and tasteful.   The french fries were horrible! They are thinner fries and were ridiculously soggy and bland tasting. I actually soaked them in malt vinegar (which i never do) to give them some flavor.   The broccoli, was well... plain steamed broccoli... nothing special by any means.  Overall, we had a great time and the service was great!"}
{"text":"We really enjoyed the food and service ... This is always a great place to eat ... no rush so that we had a great visit ... we will return"}
{"text":"I love red lobster but, this location underperformed the night I was there. Dry biscuits, over cooked vegetables, Lilty salad, and everything was under seasoned. This is not the red lobster I know so, I will be going to a different location in the future."}
{"text":"So it got to the point where I was starved  and did not care were i went to eat.  I was hoping to kill some sashimi a Watami.  I walked in there and had to turn around and walk out, out it just did not look good and the lady can not eat gluten, and she did not want Chipotle.  Dam you woman, Red Lobster it will be. I did not care anymore we needed food.    Well, i can for sure say 4 courses 15 dollars.A Shit ton of food. Clam chowder decent. Salad, decent. Coconut shrimp decent,pineapple grilled shrimp a bit salty, but decent, cheddar rolls,pretty f'n good.  Brownie desert, just plain overkill. Cost 15 dollars, I think chains set a goal of packing as many calories per dollar as possible. whew,  I felt so dirty and ashamed like the next day after beer goggles. No you did not, yes I did.   In a pinch i would go back  just order something that did not make me gain like an extra chin!. Oh the service was pretty good, sat at the bar, lots of little nose pickers making noise."}
{"text":"I thought I was done with Red Lobster when I got rid of my ex.  Mind you I don't hate the chain but I have never been really impressed.  However the birthday girl wanted their crab legs so off we went.  Arriving about 6:00 for an early dinner we were given a place in line which took a little over 30 minutes to get seated.  There is only so long a 5 year old can keep occupied with the lobsters in the tank.  If it had just been L and I we would have taken a seat at the high tops that were part of the bar even though she doesn't drink.   When were seated we were told it had been like this since about 3:30.  Starting just after we were seated it started getting quieter as fewer tables were occupied but we noticed as we left about 8:00 that with about a fourth of the tables empty there were still about 4 parties waiting to be seated.  Apparently one of the reasons they were slammed early was the all you can eat shrimp which two of us partook of.  The women chose to build their own feast and the kids got chicken fingers and linguine shrimp respectively.  To start with us adults got lobster stuffed mushrooms which were pretty good.  One of the supposedly good things about a chain in this price range is the predictability, tasty but not great,  of the food and overall we were not disappointed.   The let downs were the crab claws J went there for, the coconut shrimp both of the women ordered and the blue cheese dressing.  The stand outs were the salmon and key lime pie L ordered (and I got to share :-)).  I wasn't noticing the amount of salt with oils as I ate but after I got home I had 4 big glasses of water.  The service was spot on the entire meal.  K was not wanting for any of his 6 shrimp orders (oink).  There were no mistakes and every thing for the two kids was given priority.   That's pretty good for a chain, especially as we were a party of six spread across a 60 year span.  Given my past history with the chain I would have given them a 2 but this experience earns them a solid 3."}
{"text":"I've spent my whole 29 years wanting to go to Red Lobster because there isn't one in Vancouver where I live. On a recent trip to Calgary, my boyfriend and I finally made our way to this location. I was BEYOND excited. We told our server, Chris, that it was my first time ever in a Red Lobster and he made some great recommendations for food and was very welcoming and enthusiastic. I wanted to order the High Tide for drinks because they came in a commemorative mason jar, and was so disappointed to find out that they had run out of them already. Chris took a minute to ask how I spell my name, and came back a minute later with my very own Red Lobster name tag as a keepsake instead! I was so impressed with his service, and my meal was just as good as I had hoped it would be for the last 29 years!  Huge thank you to Chris, and to everyone at the MacLeod Trail location!"}
{"text":"Ordered togo. Service is bad and food is disgusting. I prefer going to olive garden..."}
{"text":"I had the opportunity to try out the Red Lobster Lobsterfest the other night, my server was Jeanne! And she is amazing! Loved her and the great service she provided!  Started the night out with lobster, crab & seafood stuffed mushrooms, Lobster pizza and Sweet Chili Shrimp, now everything tasted great but I have to say my favorite of those where the Sweet Chili Shrimp, holy cow those are great! Stop ordering the coconut shrimp (don't worry I love those too) and get these Sweet Chili Shrimp.  For the entrees, get ready for this, we tried: Lobster In Paradise, Ultimate Surf & Turf, Dueling Lobster Tails, Lobster Lovers Dream, Seaport Lobster & Shrimp, Bar Harbor Lobster Bake   Everything was amazing!     Lobster in Paradise is split Maine Lobster tail fried in coconut batter, spicy grilled shrimp & lobster & shrimp bake topped with toasted crushed macadamia nuts  Ultimate Surf & Turf  is a Maine lobster tail stuffed a crab stuffing & baked with a peppercorn grilled sirloin topped with Maine lobster meat in a citrus hollandaise sauce comes with mashed potatoes roasted tomatoes & green beans  Dueling Lobster Tails are 2 Maine lobster tails, one topped with tender shrimp in a creamy garlic sauce and one stuffed with crab & seafood stuffing and comes with mashed potatoes, roasted tomatoes and green beans.  Lobster Lovers Dream is Rock Lobster tail & a split Maine Lobster tail, roasted with lobster & shrimp linguini alfredo  Seaport Lobster & Shrimp is wood grilled split Maine Lobster Tail, shrimp scampi, and skewered garlic grilled shrimp on a bed of wild rice pilaf  Bar Harbor Lobster Bake is split Maine lobster tail, shrimp, scallops, mussels & linguini in a garlic & white wine broth  While all these dishes are amazing, and every dish had something unique that set them aside from the other dish, my personal favorites where the skewered garlic shrimp, the Maine lobster tail, didn't matter if it was stuffed, baked, sauced, grilled it was DELISH! I also learned that I prefer the Maine Lobster over the Rock Lobster (Rock rock Rock Lobster Down down! B52's Rock Lobster)  I had lobster for days, and I still am craving the sweet Maine lobster & sweet chili shrimp!  And if you love the coconut shrimp you should for sure try the Lobster in Paradise, omg the lobster in the coconut batter was amazing!!   To end the meal I tried the Red Velvet Cake in a Jar that was the perfect ending to a delicious feast!   Also was able to meet the Manager Carrie and many other staff members including the chefs! It was a wonderful night and had fun trying so many dishes! I cannot wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love Red Lobster and have been to this location many times over many years. Ate there again tonight. The coconut shrimp is amazing, and the crab legs - my favorite food - were cooked perfectly. Always great service."}
{"text":"I can go over there just for their cheddar bay biscuits. Great seafood. Never get tired of it."}
{"text":"For a chain restaurant Red Lobster really does a nice job. Our server was very knowledgeable, efficient, and friendly. We stopped in after a U of I volleyball game and it was about 1/2 hr. before closing. The whole restaurant was great from the greeter to the busboys. Our food was served hot and quickly. Just a great experience."}
{"text":"The best Red Lobster Location. Lobster was super fresh. Crab legs are the best!!!! We went there with a big company and were served all at the same time, thanks to servers. Nice Atmosphere. Great Service."}
{"text":"This location is CLOSED for good and unfortunately we had to find out the hard way.  We'd been drinking at the pool all afternoon and my friend has been talking about all you can eat shrimp for over a week. He really loves Red Lobster.  It was quite crushing to UBER all the way from CenPho to Scottsdale only to arrive to a closed restaurant. Even our driver was devastated.  We made the best of the situation and just continued drinking for the remainder of the night.   I called Red Lobster headquarters this morning and was told the property had been sold to a developer and that store is now closed."}
{"text":"Hubby took me here for bday dinner. I've been to Red Lobster many many times but not in Phoenix. We had the best service, warm biscuits, our food came out fast and hot. I had my favorite garlic shrimp and fried,my mom got the popcorn shrimp (kids menu) and hubby got the Cajun salmon which he loved. The staff sung happy bday and gave me a brownie and ice cream. We had a great experience"}
{"text":"Dark dreary expensive and just not good! Don't waist time or money at Red Lobster try brennan's  in grand river instead."}
{"text":"Friday, April 1 we had dinner at this restaurant.  Our meals were excellent and the service was Superb!  Our waiter was Forrest and he was the best server we have ever had.  Enjoyed the evening and will definitely go back."}
{"text":"This is our 1st trip to red lobster and we really like it we order 1.5 live lobster and we also pick our own lobster from the tank"}
{"text":"Don't expect to much when you want \"Fresh Seafood\" and go to Red Lobster.  Seems like alot of the stuff here is pre made and just heated up to order.   The atmosphere was a little on the loud side with dim lighting.  Our server was really sweet and kind though.  She was very attentive and I actually felt really bad for her due to the rude customers sitting in back of me.  The biscuits are good as always and the drinks from the bar were pretty loaded up with alcohol :)    This time I decided to get crab legs and whoa... what a bad idea that was!! Not fresh whatsoever and the shell was stale like biting into thin cardboard lol.  I honestly don't know what to rate this place overall because i get a different experience everytime i go here lol.  Their surf and turf is good though, i'd totally recommend that.  All the other shrimp trios and shrimp deals can get a little boring to eat though. Its usually more on the saltier side too.  Want seafood? pickle bills or brennans off heisley!"}
{"text":"I normally dont go to red lebster but when i do i feast on the ultimate feast this place is a gift from above. Theres no better feeling than sitting down and ordering this meal."}
{"text":"I got a GC so we came.  I have never been too much of a fan, but I have not been for years so what the heck.  We came on a Friday night.  I got the fried fish and my dining partner got the calm chowder.  It was ok.  The service was fantastic but the food was ok."}
{"text":"The biscuits. Seriously!  That's why I come. The rest of the food is pretty good too but nothing beats the biscuits. As far as the rest of the food,  tried something new and got the lobster artichoke dip. It was really good however the chips were extremely salty. I got the caesar side salad. Good but a little heavy on the dressing. Then came the ultimate feast. I wasn't really hungry at this point but leftover seafood isn't great. The shrimp, lobster and crab were great. I didn't try the rice and I only ate a couple of fries which were also very salty. As far as the service it was pretty good. Took a little long to be greeted and get our waters but it wasn't horrible."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick bite at the bar after our flight.The mussels appetizer was nothing to write home about. It seemed like were served from a frozen state and dropped into a hot sauce, not very fresh. The toast points needed more toasting. The main course of lobster tails were average, the corn on the cob and roasted potatoes were good. Service was friendly but the bar maintenance needed a little help. (See pic)"}
{"text":"It wasn't busy when my boyfriend and I went out to dinner on a Saturday night. (Surprisingly) but we waited a long time for our food, while other patrons who came before us got served. My food was good, however boyfriend ordered shrimp scampi and it was just butterfly shrimp in a garlic butter and not the actual dish. He also ordered lobster mashed potatoes, which weren't hot. The server was friendly, but the overall food and service was subpar. I guess it's gone down hill in recent years."}
{"text":"James Z, our server tonight was the best we have had since moving to Las Vegas area. Great attitude great service. Red Lobster is lucky to have him."}
{"text":"We were greeted Nicely by whom appeared. Then we had our server take our order and then another person came and took our order our order again and it was incorrect  The restaurant was not even busy very few tables. They failed to come back and even check on us throughout our visit. They failed to refill our drinks and they did not offer to fix the bill for their original mistake."}
{"text":"I normally would not rate a restaurant with a negative review but this is much needed. First the food was just Ok. The food that my husband and I ordered was all wrong. The manager Jay was not very helpful. For a manager I expected the problem to be corrected. Evidently it shows a lack in customer service! Very disappointed will not be returning! Save your money,go to the Pineville location!!!!!"}
{"text":"Yum Yum in my Tum Tum!!!   I do not like seafood! But still LOVE this place!   My sister (Nikki H.) is a big fan of seafood so I always go with her. I always order their cheesy potato soup and enjoy it with their delicious cheesy butter biscuits...mmm I cant get enough of those biscuits their too yummy we always have to order a second serving because their so yummylicious!   As my main dish I always get their Cajun Chicken Linguine Alfredo..OMG the sauce is so creamy and delicious it just melts in my mouth! I think their Chicken Alfredo might just be the best Alfredo I've ever had! I can't comment on their seafood being I'm not a fan of seafood but my sister always enjoys her meals and we are never disappointed!   If you haven't been you must get your butt over there ASAP!"}
{"text":"My fiance and I decided last minute to go here for our Valentines Day dinner. There was a 45 minute wait which we knew would happen but we got lucky and found seats within 5 minutes of arriving at the open bar! Our drinks were excellent although it did take a while to get them, but again this was valentines day so it was expected to be busy. The staff is friendly and helpful. The food was good-ish. I gave it 4 starts for that reason. The grilled shrimp has no seasoning or flavor. I love grilled shrimp so that was a downer for me. I also had the trio shrimp and it was all good except for the battered shrimp. Tasted extremely greasy so not my favorite either. Overall we enjoyed our meal and will be coming again!"}
{"text":"My husband and I haven't dined out together in a long time. After I worked a 12 hour shift, we decided to eat at Red Lobster. Red Lobster has excellent food and service. They have stepped it up since the new management took control. I ordered the fresh fish: Trout grilled to perfection with a baked potato, butter and sour cream and asparagus. I chose a tossed free salad with ranch dressing and ice tea. My husband ordered the Admirals Feast with a tossed green salad with blue cheese dressing. It was a lovely dinner, good service and the cheddar biscuits were so tasty! We will be back in the near future."}
{"text":"We went there last night and I ended up getting very sick. The waiter and staff were excellent."}
{"text":"I've never had a meal here that didn't result in diarrhea afterward. Nothing more needs to be said."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and i went to to dinner here this evening.... The hostesses were ok..not very welcoming (hence the reason for the 4 stars instead of 5) but the server service was excellent and the food was delicious. I had the admiral feast all the seafood was crispy and tasty. My boyfriend had the mussels so affordable for less than $12 and he also ordered the  stuffed mushrooms which were flavorful. As always the cheddar bay biscuits were as i had always remembered them and what keeps me coming back to Red Lobster...back home in cali we always frequented Red Lobster this is the first time we visited a Red Lobster since moving to Vegas... Monique was an exceptional server!! We will definitely be back..."}
{"text":"It's ok, but feels too much like a Dennys or Applebees at its best. Service was good. Food was mediocre. Yes I'll comeback for their lobsterfest, shrimpfest, and crabfest!  Rest of side fishes were so so."}
{"text":"Very very pleasant experience! Came here for dinner and  couldn't have been happier. From the reception to servers and managers, everyone was SO friendly - I don't know if something happened to the management...  I had to give 5 stars based on the service. I was told our clam chowders might take a while, but I was okay with it, no big deal. But then our lobster pizza came out little bit late, but it definitely wasn't too much of a wait. Plus it was delicious! (But the soups still haven't come out at this point, but we were already told twice that it might take longer so whatever, didn't care much).   Then manager came by to check up on us twice about the chowders and said they will still bring out, free of charge :) and she even took the lobster pizza off the tab too, which I thought it wasn't necessary but hey, it's free!   Food was pretty good as well but all in all, their service deserves 5 star. Even my gf felt that service was bit overwhelming :D I'd highly recommend you give this place another try if your previous experience was bit negative."}
{"text":"FOOD POISONING!!!! Absolutely horrible. Me and my husband went because we had a gift card. 1. The restaurant was VERY dirty, we went in and it stunk ( i thought maybe because the seafood) it was very dark so it was probably more dirty I just couldn't see. The menu pages were stuck together by I don't want to know what ( probably never cleaned )  2. The food okay....  3. Our server was great though.   Don't go if you want to get sick."}
{"text":"Decided to try out their endless shrimp promotion and was not disappointed. My entire party was pleased.  Only thing is you initially get quite a bit of shrimp; so much I couldn't manage to order any refills lol... I was stuffed.. all in all a good experience"}
{"text":"I've been to this location a few times and it's often quite good. They are always willing to make menu accommodations which is great! We often order the biscuits without garlic due to an allergy and they bring them to us quickly. The food is tasty and comes out at a good pace. When taking biscuits home they often give us a couple extra."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE, food poisoning!  Ive been here a couple of times the last couple of years, more recently, a few months ago at around 4PM  Cocktails taste nice but really weak...  Service is akward, food is terrible and tastes reheated, portions are small for the quality of seafood they use.  My brother had their chicken fingers from the kids meal, and at around 11PM he starts complaining about his stomach, and throughout the night he went to the washroom to vomit.   I went in the next day to talk to the manager (literally just to get a \"Im sorry\", was not looking for a free meal at all). The manager has the audacity to tell me \"Oh the effects of food poising only happens 24 hours later, so it must have been something he ate the day before\", I go on explaining that that's complete nonsense (as some one who's experienced food poising 3-4 times in their lifes, more recently from the EX). Then he goes on explaining how the chicken strips were cooked in oil over a certain temperature for a certain amount of time to ensure they were cooked.  Knob head maybe didn't get this lesson, but just because you cook the item for so and so minutes and temperature, doesn't mean the protein itself is completely sterilized. If you cook rotten/old chicken, you will get sick regardless. When I tell him this, he then asks me for my brothers name and contact number. I then have to remind him hes only 9 years old.   What a shame. Not even a \"Im sorry\". Its sad to see these chains fall apart, because of the memories I experienced there as a child. weather they last another 5-10 years, I will definitely not be returning, and letting any one know who ever mentions their name to stay away."}
{"text":"It was alright... Went for the Never-Ending shrimp and wasn't really impressed. I knew exactly how you'd be served shrimp... A skewer at a time, at least 10 minutes apart... I've read somewhere that if you want to eat less, to lose weight, space your portions apart... I think they at Red Lobster read the same article before they came out with this \"unlimited shrimp\"."}
{"text":"Great service great entre and desert ... I was a little skeptical pulling in the parking lot with so few cars ... and we were seated right away. The shrimp cocktail was ok  - nothing special. The caprese  salad was production grade and mediocre. But then came the entres salmon, lobster, shrimp platter for me - the spouse had New Orleans salmón & shrimp .... both delicious!"}
{"text":"Visited and ate recently on a Friday evening around 8:30, as usual it was a most pleasant experience with good service, fast responses to customer needs and wants, & great food for a decent price.  Our waitress Shawn (not sure of the spelling) was great in getting my family and I what we were looking for, 5 stars is a fair score for this place I really can't remember the last time we didn't have a good time eating at this location."}
{"text":"My friends and I decided to try their Endless Shrimp for dinner. The flavours they offered are Pineapple Habanero Coconut Bites, Teriyaki Grilled Shrimp, Hand-Breaded Shrimp, Shrimp Linguini Alfredo and Garlic Shrimp. One of us did 100 and I did 70, the rest didn't count. We ordered a few round of Garlic Shrimp and one time, it came dry (without liquid) with rice in it. The shrimps were smaller than I would expect - and you could buy them at the grocery store for approximately $10 for 30-40 shrimps.  I would suggest avoid the Shrimp Linguini Alfredo if you wanna eat more shrimp. The Alfredo sauce itself - lets just say I could do it myself at home with a store bought sauce.   So overall, the experience was meh. I'd rather got to a Japanese restaurant and get the AYCE buffet and order shrimps and fried scallops."}
{"text":"We had really good service. The only two things I would say is the calamari is not good and one of my sides were cold. The side was replaced immediately with no fuss. Would definitely eat there again."}
{"text":"This was the first Red Lobster restaurant I've ever eaten at.  The food is okay. It's your typical sea food chain restaurant fare. Nothing extraordinary. What I really want to do is give a big thanks to our server, Penny. She was attentive from the get go and she made us feel at home. We did have a problem, a rather big one, but she was super professional about it. My mother found a hair in her food. I know, gross. She brought it to Penny's attention and she was really apologetic. She called her manager over and she comped our meal. If it weren't for Penny, I would have rated it 2 stars, honestly.  I'll probably never eat there again, but I wanted to make sure to give credit where it is due."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised to have a great meal here. It's been years since I came to Eat at a Red Lobster. I must say he bread is still as I remembered it. The lobster dish combo was a good serving and got me stuffed. The quality of the lobster was good. A little over cooked but got the job done. Definitely a good buy for the size. I'll be coming back for more."}
{"text":"It would love if they took reservations for large groups but as it was we, group of 8 + baby were seated VERY quickly on a Saturday evening (5pm).   Both our waitresses were excellent. Specials were explained well and our drinks were at the table fast. The food took a bit long BUT it was busy so we didn't mind.   Everyone's meal was very good and just the right portion size.   We had two birthdays being celebrated and they brought out a little something extra for them.   Did I mention how wonderful our waitresses were...they were a breath of fresh air.  I highly recommend this location."}
{"text":"Some co-workers and I went to Red Lobster this week for the Endless Shrimp event. It was officially my first time at a Red Lobster. Not normally a place I'd choose, but all the hype about the endless shrimp event was enough to get me to try - just once.   One of our crew has a shrimp allergy, (I know, we're terrible people for bringing her here - and on her birthday, no less!) but the staff handled things with ease. The manager came by our table to explain how her food would be handled, and that it would come out before everyone else's meal to ensure there was no chance of cross-contamination. Very well-handled, Red Lobster!  The menu is quite large, with lots of choices. Of course, it's mostly seafood, but there are plenty of options for anyone in a group who may not be a seafood eater. Two of us had the endless shrimp, which comes with a side salad and your choice of rice, potato or broccoli, and every table gets a basket of the cheddar biscuits - I just love these!   I chose the Nashville Hot and the Mediterranean shrimp to start, followed up by the savoury garlic shrimp. I really didn't like the Nashville Hot, because they tasted like they were doused in sugar and I found them to be way too sweet. I had to smother them in hot sauce to make them edible. The Mediterranean shrimp were ok, but tasted a bit under-seasoned. I did enjoy the garlic shrimp, but I had to blot off a lot of the butter with some napkins, as they got to be a bit greasy-tasting after the first few bites. This is going to sound weird, but I really love that you get a good-sized serving of broccoli with your meal. Too many restaurants these days treat veggies like a garnish and you don't usually get many on your plate. I felt less guilty eating all that shrimp, having a big pile of broccoli to go with it. Especially since I didn't eat the side salad (it was basically swimming in dressing, which I forgot to ask to have on the side) so I couldn't eat it.   Despite my food tasting fairly mediocre, I give this place three stars because of the service (especially the way they handled my friend's allergy) but they don't get full points because we did say it was her birthday - and not so much as a free drink or dessert was offered. She did enjoy her salmon entrée, though, so she left quite happy.   I don't think I'd ever choose to return, but I know that if I ever went again with a group, there are plenty of choices on the menu. Plus, the cheddar biscuits are almost worth a return visit."}
{"text":"Went there on a Thursday night for the endless shrimp. Got there at about 830 and I guess they closed at 10. The waiter was an elderly man, he was very straight to the point just got our order and left us alone. Some people may like that approach, some may feel it's bad customer service but we didn't mind we were hungry. However we felt very rushed, at about 930 the waiter told us they were doing last call on orders, and the other employees were cleaning vacuuming in the restaurant while there were still customers. I find that, not good service at all. Regardless of closing time, any customers that were in the store, should have been able to stay until they were finished.  Another couple came in at the same time to eat, around 9:30 and when they were getting their order taken, they were told it was also last call. What's the point of taking in customers at 930 then? Especially for endless shrimp. Poor couple didn't even get their money's worth. The white lady waitress who wasn't even our waiter just kept rushing us to get out. A friend of mind asked if he could go for a cigarette and she told him that he would not be allowed back in as they were locking the doors.  Everything just felt very rushed with the service we had. And we drove all the way to thorn hill to try when we could have literally went down the street to the dufferin location."}
{"text":"Typical location. If I could give an additional half star I would because it's one of the largest locations in the chain, meaning wait times are short, even during peak meal times."}
{"text":"Great service.  Thank you Cassy  Oops,  supposed to be 5 stars.   Hit wrong side.   Very organised and well timed for the amount of people we had.   19 i think."}
{"text":"I was feeling nostalgic with my mom and aunt. We hadn't been to Red Lobster since I was a kid. There was a wait. We were cool with that. After about 20 minutes we bellied up to the bar to have a drink while we waited.  The bar itself was covered in a thick film of greasy finger prints and beer. I asked the busy bartender for a rag to wipe it. Without responding or looking at us, she was visibly aggravated and half ass wiped the bar, continuing to ignore our many thanks.  I ordered a $5 beer. The glass was filthy. I'm really not that picky (yes I guess I don't mind drinking beer from a dirty glass) and did not want to irritate her further, so I kept quiet.  We were soon seated and I ordered another beer from our server. This time there was a full feather floating in my glass. A feather!!? The server sent the manager over who apologized about sending out 2 nasty $5 glasses of beer. He said he would comp our check.  We ordered seafood platters of what can only be described as bagged pre breaded frozen less-than-fast food-quality crap. I would have preferred ANY fast food chain to this food. $20 a plate!?!? Bahaha! I will NEVER spend any money at a Red Lobster again!  We had to go to the bar to ask for silver wear after our food came. Our waiter only checked on us ONCE. We complained yet again. It was ok. The manager was comping for the beer at least.   *Ahem*  He took $2 off of our bill.  $2."}
{"text":"went here last Wednesday  great serves food is always good don't go here much love love love their food lobster is my kryptonite i recomend this highly"}
{"text":"Can I just say that after years of discriminating, I finally caved and ate at a Red Lobster.  Of course, this was due to taking my 78 year old mom out shopping.  She wanted Red Lobster and I obliged.  I bet her that 70% of the people would be 60 and over in the place and she disagreed.  I was right.    So what though. It was a very good meal.  I thought the Creamy Potato Bacon Soup was excellent.  Good iced tea that was not watered down.  I had the Peach BBQ Grilled Shrimp and the Bacon Wrapped Scampi and it was very much worth the $15.95 price.  The biscuits.....OMG!  I could have eaten 12 and had no problem.    I ate 4 and settled.  Don't knock the Lobster!"}
{"text":"I've always wanted to try Lobsterfest at Red Lobster and received a coupon for $5 off, so I decided to go.    I got the Maritime Lobster & Shrimp Trio b/c I really wanted to try the lobster and shrimp mac and cheese.  It was edible.  I wouldn't get it again, however.  I was surprised the the outside noodles were warm but the inside noodles were cold since it took so long for our food to come out.  The lobster was overcooked.  I asked for the breaded shrimp instead of the skewer, but instead I received the garlic shrimp scampini.  The broccoli was good!  lol  The cheese biscuits were to die for, as usual.  Fresh out of the oven.  I'm going to learn how to make these at home so I don't have to come to Red Lobster just for these.    The service was a tad slow at times, but very friendly.  The manager was also going table to table making sure everything was fine.    All in all, it wasn't worth the price.  It's an expensive chain with mediocre food.  My first and last time at Lobsterfest."}
{"text":"Yummy food, but some dishes have a lot of butter and fat. The salmon is really good. Lobster was kinda tasteless and fatty."}
{"text":"Unlike some reviews here, the food was not bad but it's the service that's lacking.  Came here for the endless shrimp, when I wanted to order two different shrimps for my refill I was told that it was one per order.  Ok no prob, yet the server at the other table was offering customers two refills each person.  No consistency.  We weren't given bread for our salad and told it'd come later, but it never did.  Everyone else got bread but I she forgot.  Had to remind her after we were already eating the main course.  My server gave extra buns to the table behind us to take home, but for us she didn't bother.  Didn't offer to bag our leftovers.  She came and checked on us throughout the meal but the same consistency being given to other customers would have been nice."}
{"text":"Don't listen to those reviews guys! I don't know if they had a stroke of bad luck or anything but you won't regret your time here.   I came with a party of three and I ordered the Salmon New Orleans which can only be described as amazing. The outside is crunchy, but the inside melts in your mouth like butter. The flavors were well balanced and it wasn't oversalted at all.   Unlike the other reviews, my server was great. She was friendly, approachable, and seemed like she actually wanted to be there. She even remembered to throw in a fresh slice of lemon & lime when she refilled my drink! (Sorry I don't remember your name, but we came on  May 9th around 9 pm)  The only negative thing I have to say is that I would've preferred more cherry tomatoes in my garden salad but that doesn't deserve a star taken off."}
{"text":"\"Fried shrimp\" and \"cheddar biscuits\" my inner gut told me and the family agreed!  So, onward to Red Lobster and this location was great in addressing the crave! The food was very good (5/5).  We started with the Langostino artichoke dip which was hot and fresh and tasty.  The dishes included a couple of pick your combination with fried shrimp and bay scallops; the infamous \"admirals feast\"; and linguine with shrimp. Just some righteous fried food! The service was outstanding and Reggie should be up for an Oscar for his performance (5/5).  Drinks were full constantly and chedda biscuits ample!   The ambiance (4/5) is par for the course but well kept and felt clean. If you need to quell the seafood lover in you, give this location a go; you'll be pleased."}
{"text":"There is something about red lobster and me.. From the cheddar biscuits to the main meal.. I just love the food!! and the Staffs are not rude which is always a big deal to me."}
{"text":"Red Lobster is always really crowded because peeps love the cheddar biscuits.  Who are we kidding here?  We all know it's the damn cheddar biscuits that keep em' coming.  Even the wait staff knows it.  Our waiter had his shtick down to a science and his main sell was the what???    Cheddar biscuits.    In fact towards the end of our meal he greeted a couple that had just sat down behind us, and ran through his entire spiel word for word as he had done for us.    The humiliating part was that the woman has the EXACT same reaction that I did when he said, \"and might I say, the cheddar biscuits are the best part of the meal!\"    \"Hahaha!  Yes!!\"  *nods and smiles like a complete jackass*"}
{"text":"My daughter and I went for our birthday celebration for lunch and we were not disappointed. The food was outstanding and never disappoints. Our server Tracy P. was very attentive, fun yet always professional.  Her service was so superb we made sure the manager knew.  She made our birthday meal very memorable. Thank you Tracy P.!"}
{"text":"David was my server at 75th Ave and Bell Rd location.  He was slow, unattentive and had to be asked 3 times for one item.  One Lobster Fest was cooked perfectly, but one was severely overcooked and rubbery.  The second one came out just as bad.  The manager intervened and replaced the lobster with another item that was cooked to perfection.  I will never go back to this location and will not recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"Noch so eine Kette, bei der ich mich Frage, warum es die nicht auch bei uns geben kann. Frisches Seafood in verschiedenen Ausprägungen zu vernünftigen Preisen."}
{"text":"Service was amazing , very friendly staff. We had Anthony who as very helpful cordial and professional. Definitely will come again"}
{"text":"I've been to this location 8 times, why because I like to give chances to this restaurant,  but today I give up there is no hope for this red lobster chain I am done ! no more! I will never come back ever!.  Today I ordered mussels with wine which taste like a frozen entree no joke there's no difference between the box that I bought at fry's store, my daughter ordered Mac and cheese with mashed potatoes omg taste like kraft from the box again. The only thing good is the bread that's all I'm not there for the bread !!!  This place need changes. sorry ! I'll rather drive 40 minutes to Pappadeux and pay double to eat great non box tasting food !! just being honest."}
{"text":"I love this red lobster.  I have been there many times and will continue to go there. Sunday, my mom and i went for lunch.  We both ordered the ultimate feast.  For the first time, the lobster was a little tough for me.  My mom said hers was perfect.  Tim, the manager, was great.  The waitress and tim were both great actually.  Tim did something i never expected, he took my whole meal off my ticket.  That wasnt necessary.  The rest of my meal was perfect.  But, when i got my bill, he had taken it off. I did not expect that at all.  That isnt a cheap meal at all but so worth the money.  Tim just totally amazed me.  I feel guilty for saying anything about the lobster now.  I have a problem with complaining, it makes me feel bad but my mom said i needed to let them know.  I have had this meal a lot but never had a problem.   Thank you tim, and thank you red lobster for having such great food.  And, i only love this one.  For me, they are the best."}
{"text":"I generally love Red Lobster, so I was genuinely disappointed with some of our food. I got grilled shrimp over rice pilaf. The shrimp was over cooked which made it chewy. It and the rice had little to no seasoning. My husband had fried fish which honestly looked like a frozen fish pattie. There was tons of breaking and little fish. I gave this location 3 stars because our waitress was friendly, though slow; the coconut shrimp appetizer was wonderful, and the bread delish! To drop 50 bucks for lunch and get sub par entrees is very disappointing. We will probably give it one more try, so I hope things will get better."}
{"text":"I used to come here all the time with my family years ago, but the crowd and experience has definitely changed drastically since I was last here.  The service was fairly decent, but the food was extremely over salted.   The people dining here were extremely loud, and this wasn't limited to a single group of people.  There used to be a cozy and warm vibe here, but that's been completely voided by the obnoxious behavior of the patrons.  I suppose it's not Red Lobster's fault, it's just a shame to see the place change like that.  One thing has remained the same though...the Cheddar Bay biscuits are just as delicious as I remember them!"}
{"text":"Had a gift card and their $10  coupon for Lobsterfest.   This place is getting to be a real dive!   It is being remodeled and shows it.   About 9 miles away from where we live, and arrived at 4:30 PM on Sunday.   Outside was crowded, but were taken in about 5 minutes.   I showed pic of $10 coupon and manager said it was okay.   We were seated by the back of restaurant and Jason was server.  Nice boy!  Literally! Husband ordered the stuffed tilapia, sorry, out of it at 4:30 PM! substituted sole. I had the Lobster tail, shrimp scampi, fried shrimps (tiny) and crab legs.   Meal arrived, crab legs smelled at the connection where the legs are of iodine.  Bad sign, old!  Lobster tail overcooked.   Husband's dish were 3 or 4 pieces of fish, no stuffing, no lobster!  Took back lobster tail, took back husbands fish.  Returned with new lobster tail.  Couldn't get any meat out of crab legs, Jason put on plastic gloves and took out about a tablespoon of crab out of three legs. Cold!   Husband still not getting his meal.  When it was finally served, I was just about finished.   2 small pieces of fish wrapped around stuffing, 2 pieces of lobster! no broccoli, just a baked potato.   Never got more biscuits either.    Gave the server my $50 gift card and a credit card as bill was almost $40 told him to take out $25 from gift card and put rest on credit card.   Got back credit card with $23 charged to it.  Where is the gift card?  Oh, he said \"I threw it in the garbage!  Unbelievable!!!  He dug it out and gave it back to me and re-did the entire bill.   Now it was $25 plus the balance on the credit card. WOW!  I went to the bar manager, because I had asked for a manager before getting the bill and she never showed up.   The bar manager took the receipts went back to check that I had $25 left on my gift card.   Instead, he came back and gave me a NEW card.    Wrote to Red Lobster corporate and called up today.    Will never go back there again !  Overpriced, incorrect and unbelievable!!!"}
{"text":"As odd as this might sound...I do not come here for seafood...I have other less \"chainy\" and fresh options for that.  Instead I choose to eat here for appetizers, their biscuits, and their lobsterita. Yeah..you heard me..their lobsterita. One of the few spots I have found with a traditional large margarita that isn't 10 bucks.  So go for dinner if you wish...or go grab some appetizer and a lobsterita ;D"}
{"text":"The service and food was terrible. I have to think the management just does not care. The food was cold, and undercooked. I asked for it well done, our waitress argued with me saying they always make it well done after she served it to us undercooked. Our experience here did not even deserve a one star."}
{"text":"I decided that for my 58th birthday, I was going to have an early dinner at a nice place.   Now, Red Lobster was not at the top of the list because I had been here before a few times. However, since I was looking to eat at around 3:00P.M., and my other two choices were not yet open, so I ended up here.   I ordered a Sunset Passion Colada and the Lobster tail, Salmon and Shrimp with Rice Pilaf (the rice was litterly a last minute change that they accommodated easily).  From the hostess, the waitress and the extra help, everyone was friendly and professional.   The drink was cold and refreshing. And, while it gave me a nice buzz, it didn't kbock me on mt butt. And, he food was hot and absolutely delicious! However, for some people, this dish they have a little too much olive oil. But for me, being Italian, no problemo!  I'll be back."}
{"text":"Went for Lobster Fest, ordered the Duel Lobster Tails they were Excellent! ...our server Shawn with a \"W\" was extremely kind, very thorough and  knowledge when it came to items on the menu! Thank you Shawn!!"}
{"text":"Went to Red Lobster last night for my daughters birthday dinner. First off we had to wait for about an hour to be seated on a Monday night. Then our waitress was friendly enough but not a good waitress. Took forever to get our food and when it came my lobster was so overcooked that parts of it was crunchy! I didn't bother sending it back because we had already been there for 2 hours and everyone was getting cranky. My son in laws steak was overcooked and my daughters steak had no flavor. Never got refills on our drinks, so we sat there with empty glasses. I was very disappointed as this dinner was for my daughter and it was just awful!! Always loved Red Lobster but the last few times I've been there it's been bad. Wanted to give it another chance but I really don't think we'll ever be going back!! Bad service, over priced and quality of the food is bad."}
{"text":"We went in for lunch for the Lobster Fest and it was our 1st time to a  Red Lobster. Great food and top notch service. I had the lobster tacos and my husband had the Rock Lobster. The entrees were filling and came with a dude and salad plus their cheddar cheese biscuits! Everyone was super friendly insuring we were taken care of. Tania was our server and she was excellent!"}
{"text":"Great service.  We were there last week, just passing through the area.  Our server was new-ish and had a shadow the whole time.  Didn't need it in my opinion, she was great.  The food runner though is what prevents me from giving that last star.  WHY OH WHY do they have to carry the food tray ON the shoulder?  I do not want your hair dangling in my food.  Really, we don't.  It's such a turn off to see them walking around delivering food that way and I always just pray my food was on the other side  Yuck."}
{"text":"I love lobster and red lobster dishes out some great lobster meals. I would love for a lower price, but they are consistent with their menu and everything is yummy. I wish they had one closer to where I live (west-coast of Canada)."}
{"text":"I have visited red lobster many time but have not been that satisfied but today the food was off hook, meaning fantastic and the customer service was very prompt and the waitress was very polite. Best Birthday present ever...thanks hunny for taking me!"}
{"text":"For the record, I am a seafood snob. I was lucky enough to grow up on the coast and spent most of my life eating \"caught today\" seafood. I have been here for the last 9 years and accept that what I get here is not the same as what I get there. That being said, I still don't get why people think that Red Lobster is GREAT seafood.  The first thing to the table is always the biscuits and they are the best part of the meal. I usually choose some kind of combination meal but it depends on what the promotion is at any given time. Tonight I had a Lobster-Fest  meal with rock lobster, maritime lobster and shrimp with lobster pasta. The pasta was ok and maritime tail was ok. The best part (besides the bread) was the split rock lobster tail. It was cooked well and worked with the drawn butter dip.   The prices seem to have gone up over the last few years and the quality has gone down or stayed the same. The food is edible but generally lacks the deliciousness required for us to wait in line for 50 minutes for a table.  I know that I will go again as my father-in-law likes to go there when he visits, but it's not going to be a place I choose when it's my turn decide where we should go."}
{"text":"Service was terrific. Our waiter's name was Warner. The food was another story. I don't know why I keep trying this place expecting it to be better. That is the definition of insanity. I had the three entree combo. The sea scallops were well seasoned but arrived in a dish of murky liquid and butter. They were over cooked. Coconut shrimp were okay and the small piece of salmon was lost on my large seemingly empty plate.  The side of mashed sweet potatoes had a \"bourbon\" glaze and pecans. The glazed tasted vinegar-like. I do not recommend it at all. It was reminiscent of hoisen sauce.   My table mates would rate their entrees 3 stars."}
{"text":"It was delicious.  The reviews scared me but we decided to give it a try. So happy we did! My husband ordered the Lobster Tacos and I tried the Yucatán Shrimp,  we both had their salads. It was Saturday during lunch, pretty busy but service was great. Lunch portions were perfect! I couldn't even finish.  Dominique served us. She was very pleasant. Overall very satisfied."}
{"text":"This place had awesome service and amazing food.  The server was honestly the best server I've ever had hands down ok any restaurant!!! She killed it.  And made our night because we had gone to a restaurant before where literally we had to walk out at the party of being served our beer... so thanks red lady hater the food was amazing and so was the service!!"}
{"text":"Pricey for the food you get unless it's all you can eat shrimp. The service is good but food sometimes cold, for the price it shouldn't be."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to the location.  What a refreshing difference from the Gastonia location.  Although we had a fairly long wait (45), which is not unexpected on a Saturday night, I felt it was worth the wait.  Went here for LobsterFest, and was pleasantly surprised that at 9:30, they still had everything we ordered.  My mojito was delicious;  our server very attentive and well informed about the menu.   The food was fresh and well presented.  I really was impressed with the level of service we received, especially given how packed the place was that night."}
{"text":"Oh, I like Red Lobster. Kill me. I had the same dinner Darren had (Wood-Grilled Lobster, Shrimp and Scallops) and thought everything was succulent and juicy. I also liked the Lobster Artichoke Dip. The service was great even thought we came in an hour or so before closing."}
{"text":"The biscuits taste good...a lot of deep fried or breaded items on the menu...we had the new pepper panko crusted calamari which was pretty tasty; but very crunchy. I had the mussels as a meal, which is technically an appetizer; but it's a very generous portion :)"}
{"text":"Horrible.  Service is atrocious.  These people are trained by morons.  There was no hostess and out of the 6 servers who saw people waiting not one did anything about it.  I asked for us to be seated and after 5 more minutes we left.  We knew if we had been seated the service would have been as bad or worse.  I guess people work there to give free food to family and friends.  They suck at service.  Suck!!!!  Anyone who gives this place five stars is lying, friends of someone who works there, has never reviewed anything on yelp before or all of the above.   Lying."}
{"text":"Nice clean restaurant. Biscuits at lunch were fantastic. Will definitely come back if for no other reason than those biscuits!!"}
{"text":"My wife and her family took me here for my birthday, the service was ok we had about 12 people nothing too big. We had two servers both were pretty nice. We ordered food kept it going like a normal service I got the Bar Harbor and it was pretty awesome I got them to add Cajun seasoning into it since I like spicy food. But rather good couldn't complain.  BUT my wife's grandma got a steak and Lobster, she order a medium and it came out well done and her lobster was raw no idea how this happened considering you cook them at two different times but so be it. She sent it back and by the time she got it back we had already ate all our food and had finished desert. I mean what the heck how does it take that long to cook a medium steak? It doesn't! By the time she got her food she wasn't hungry anymore.  So we get the checks and the server tells me that the manager comped her food since it was messed up and that we wouldn't have to worry about paying for it. Well then they gave her another bill and said that she had to pay for it how the hell that works is beyond me, but she was stuck paying for the damn food that the manager told us we would get credited.   Near the end of the service the servers lacked and kind of vanished and it was just a huge cluster. The quality of this place just tanked and fell low.  The only good thing was that the cheese biscuits here are bomb!!! Everything else is a joke."}
{"text":"Better is available, but its not so bad that I wouldn't return. Certainly, Red Lobster is not the definitive answer to seafood! That said....  we'll go through the pros/cons:  PROS: Seafood close to home.  CONS: Could be cleaner (Restrooms are definitely an opportunity to explore greater cleanliness standards); Some of the staff could be nicer (its a mixed bag); The wait can be outrageous and there seems to be no rush to bus tables and turn them over after a check is cleared; Food quality is not consistent.   Overall, Red Lobster is still an okay place to get some seafood.  Its close to home, its moderately priced (for the fare), however, the food is inconsistent.  Let me clarify... 7 times out of 10, the food is okay. There are those couple of times, though, that the food is absolutely disgusting!  It's either cold, tough and overcooked or it just doesn't taste fresh at all. Its really just chalked up to \"consumer beware\".   The Cheddar Bay Biscuits, though.... oh yes... they are always amazing!  lol  Do I recommend it? If a friend said \"Where should I go for some great seafood?\" Red Lobster (any location) wouldn't even be in my Top 5 list."}
{"text":"Came here for my boyfriend's birthday, and it was an incredible experience. They don't take reservations for less than 8 people, so we showed up at 10 to avoid any wait times, which worked perfectly (they close at 11, but obviously you can stay as long as you want after you order). I told the host to inform our sever to bring a birthday cake, which you have to pay for, and they brought out a candle and sang a birthday song for him after asking his name. Everything was perfect and they were beyond friendly and accommodating. Besides that, the food was delicious. We got the artichoke dip and the shrimp cocktail, then the ultimate feast. The crab legs and lobster tail were great, and honestly everything else was delicious.  TLDR; first time trying Red Lobster, definitely coming here again. Delicious food and excellent service."}
{"text":"I have eaten at this Red Lobster three times and never had any major complaints.   One time I remember being annoyed with the waitress because she kept coming over to our table every two minutes and asking if everything was ok. She asked before I had even taken a bite, each time interrupting our conversation. Is being too attentive really a bad thing in a restaurant?  Other than that, I have found the food decent and serve time adequate. I LOVE the unlimited basket of bisquits and look forward to returning to RL just for those."}
{"text":"My husband and I had dinner at the red lobster located in north Olmsted. We got there at about 4:30 pm. On a Friday. They greeted us right away and showed us to our seat. Our waitress was Jane and was the best waitress we've had in a long time. She took the time and explained the different parts of interest in the menu. I asked for water with lots of ice. She not only brought a glass of water with lots of ice she also brought a glass with all ice. I'm not a seafood eater so she took the time to help me select something I would be able to eat and like. My husband had the admirals feast with green beans and mushrooms. And he asked about their beers. She recommended a beer and he liked it. I had the Cajun chicken with linguine noodles. But without the Cajun. The noodles sauce had garlic in it. Too much for my stomach. Otherwise it was very delicious. We even called the manager over to let her know how happy we were with the service we received from the waitress.  Yes, I would recommend this place to my friends. Even though I don't eat seafood I would consider going back there.  Yesterday February 4, 2018 we came with another couple. The husband of the other couple had the Cajun chicken and he liked his meal. His wife had Walt's favorite shrimp with baked potato. She said shrimp wasn't as good quality as it used to be. She also said cheesy biscuits were not cheesy. My husband had the lobster lovers dream with green beans and mushrooms. He didn't care for the green beans. I had the Cajun chicken without the Cajun. This time I enjoyed the meal. Everything tasted just right. Jacquelyn also served my glass of water and glass of ice correctly. The manager came around once and asked how things were. Because of the Super Bowl it wasn't busy. Yes we will come back a gain. We giving it a 4 star because the experience wasn't as great as last year"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by my dinner at Red Lobster. My expectations weren't real high, but this area is basically all chain restaurants and I decided I was hungry for their famous biscuits. My waitress was phenomenal!"}
{"text":"Girls night out on Tuesday evening.  Service was ok to start, drinks came as we took our time ordering while catching up.  Server came by several times so we made up our minds and placed our order.  Food came quite quickly.  Main courses no longer come with butter or lemon, although the pictures on the menu show many dishes having a grilled lemon.  Waited and waited for our server to come back to order these but she never did.  Good thing the server in the adjacent section was quite attentive to her customers as she brought these out to us. Our server shows up giving song and dance about the food no longer comes with butter or lemon (order was fire grilled salmon, lobster and shrimp) because mgmt is trying to save money. The food was mediocre at best.  The restaurant was quite busy when we left at 7pm but i wont be back.  For the price I can get far better food and much better service elsewhere."}
{"text":"I went to Red Lobster today with my family the service was horrible. Terrance the waiter was rude to my 12 year old son. My appetizer was  cold, half of the bowl of muscles were closed.  We will not be returning to this location ,10220 North 28th Dr Phoenix."}
{"text":"Red Lobster is far from my favorite restaurant, but after meeting up with my family for dinner, I must say I'm quite pleased with my dinner. Our server, Kim, was fantastic and very attentive. She corrected a mistake with my brother's meal without question and made sure that we had everything we needed. I got the Cajun chicken which was really garlicky and not quite as spicy as I thought it would be but it was really good. Only reason I'm giving it four stars instead of five is because of the issue with my brothers steak not being cooked to order."}
{"text":"This is the first time that I have visited a Red Lobster.  The food was as expected for a chain store, and actually not bad.  Our waiter, however, ruined the evening.  The three of us ordered 2 large entrees, one appetizer, and 3 drinks.  After he served as the drinks, we asked for 3 glasses of water, and he brought 1.  He didn't see happy about that.  When we ordered, we told him that we were going to share the entrees, and asked that he bring us 3 smaller plates to share.  He brought 2, and when we asked for a third, he really didn't seem happy about it.  When he came back, we asked for a bottle of Tobasco, and he told us that we should have told him everything at once, and not one thing at a time.  I don't think I have ever heard that we need to aggregate my requests before.  When we asked for the check, we made sure that we asked for the leftover boxes at the same time, cuz we didn't want to get another not-so-welcoming comment again."}
{"text":"Nothing exciting.. biscuits were good, mashed was good, salmon lacked flavor. Ordered broccoli got green beans. Lunch was like 60$ so WAY over priced. Sandi our server was that kind of snarky server that borders rude but hasn't crossed that line yet. Also the toilet paper was in the wrong direction"}
{"text":"Justin was AWESOME! The food was hot and fresh!  Bests Red Lobster I have ever been to!  Enough said!"}
{"text":"Remember the good old days of Red Lobster? Oh, the hush puppies were so good. Gone. The fried seafood platter was so good. Gone. The yummy marinated seafood salad. Gone. The red wine vinaigrette salad dressing that was the best and they had for decades. Gone. A shrimp and rice dish called shrimp roosevelt. Gone. Iceburg lettuce with anything other than the thick hard pieces. Gone. Romaine lettuce with anything other than the hard stems. Gone. Cheese on the salad. Gone. Reasonable prices. Gone. I know most of these issues are corporate and not the fault of this particular franchise, but some are; therefore, my weekly visits are down to monthly at best."}
{"text":"Went here with my family on Tuesday night! The severs were so dam rude! Don't dare ask a question cause if they don't know they will never come back after they leave to find out! I spend 135 dollars here for horrible service and never once saw a manager! Even the food runner was rude as all hell!! My advise don't EVER go The this red lobster!! Horrible horrible horrible!"}
{"text":"Holy cow, this was the worst meal I've had in a very long time. The only saving grace is the cheese bread. This place isn't what it used to be."}
{"text":"Visiting Red Lobster for seafood is always a great experience. Tonight, the experience was enhanced in a massive way, thanks to our hostess, Toni. Toni was super friendly, professional, and knowledgeable about the menu. She understood that we were in a hurry, and ensured that the entire process of ordering and having the food at our table took less than 15 minutes. On a stressful Friday evening, lineups are usually long, and restaurant staff are running around. In such a scenario, hostesses like Toni, who manage maintain professionalism with a smile, truly leave an impression. I'm definitely going to request to be served by Toni on my next visit!"}
{"text":"This is a good place to go to get seafood if you are on a budget. The food is fairly fresh and the recipes are not bad to mediocre. Plus they have those addicting biscuits that you have to eat just one more of. Service is fair although sometimes the food takes a really long time to come. A good place to go during all you can eat crab or shrimp fest to get your fill for a low price. Very family friendly."}
{"text":"Our family used to love coming to Red Lobster to celebrate special occasions like birthdays, New Years Eve and Valentine's Day. However, over our last few visits, we've noticed a decline in both quality and value of the food.   We recently visited with four adults and a toddler and spent over $200 including tip. No one left satisfied. Three of us ordered the surf and turf entree and the steak they served was of low quality and did not taste good. The sizes of the steaks all varied-- the largest one was almost double the size of the smallest one. The Rock lobster tails were rubbery, tasted obviously frozen and were not pulled up from the shell (which is how we usually receive them...not sure why this wasn't done this time), which made them hard to eat. The portion of French fries we got on the side was chincy. The second batch of biscuits we received were burnt. The hostess who assigned our table looked miserable.   We don't mind spending $$$ on food, but it better be good. We all agreed that Red Lobster would no longer be on our rotation of restaurants to visit as a family from now on. The value just isn't there anymore. There are tons of other restaurants with better food for less money.   See ya, Red Lobster! It was fun while it lasted..."}
{"text":"This wasn't a particularly awful experience, our waiter was great, but the wait was very long and service was slow (not really our server's fault.) but the whole establishment seemed to be a little bit understaffed for a weekend night.  I can't really give this place more than 3 stars because my fish and chips was particularly disappointing. The rest of my family was pleased with their meal, but not really impressed, and for the price, I would have hoped it was a little bit more impressive.  Oh, and also there that's part where no matter what location I go to, Red Lobster always seems to make my ill in some way. But your mileage may vary.  Take it or leave it, it's chain seafood.  Not bad, but not great."}
{"text":"Wait way too long, almost an hour after hostess said 30 to 40 minutes. Food not worth the lie about wait time!"}
{"text":"The only reason I'm got giving them a one is because the serve was nice and the manager was very accommodating. I ordered the lobster bisque soup and it was extremely salty and the cesar salad was drenched in dressing. My dad ordered the clam chowder soup and it tasty bland there was no real flavor. My sister in law ordered the lobster artichoke dip and she said it tasted like mayo. But as always the cheddar bay biscuits were warm and delicious. We won't, however be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"We waited a long time on Valentine's Day because you could not make reservations that day, but it was definitely worth the wait. Perfect Cheddar Biscuits, amazing Lobster, and the best shrimp I have ever had. I am looking forward to going again and recommend it to anyone. Very professional staff and great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Awful customer service. Insect issues at our table and rude staff. Always and issue here even with take out orders. The lady that's the night manager is extremely rude and unapologetic about her staff when notified. We have even been turned away when it was a quarter til closing by her. Do not patronize this establishment. They treat customers poorly here."}
{"text":"Taste for garlic shrimp, and my needs were met. Great service and wait time was minimal. Biscuits were on point. Great waitress!"}
{"text":"Came here for Father's Day was great cause we were seated right away. Great food especially the lobster pizza which we come for all the time. So just wanted to say what amazing service we get from Aubrei. If you go look for her she's Awesome and so friendly especially to our little girl. Thanks Aubrei!!!"}
{"text":"It was a fun birthday night for my niece and the family. Almost all of us had the endless shrimp feast and the waitress was great about keeping it coming-- endless is an understatement. We are till we couldn't eat anymore!  This is red lobster- chain food- chain atmosphere. I wasn't bowled over and I want disappointed either.  A lot of fried food but still a good place to host a big group!"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner very nice and quiet. The waitress was very knowledgable of the menu and helpful. I had the Harbor Bake which had lobster, shrimp, scallops and muscles was very delicious definitely recommend this item. My wife had the Walt Shrimp and Snow Crab Legs which she shared with me and was also very delicious. I would recommend this restaurant for any occasion. $70"}
{"text":"Here for Lobsterfest. Food and service is good, HOWEVER, I'm eating at the bar and 4 elderly people sit down thinking the area they sat at is part of the bar. The staff member makes them move. 2 of them use a walker and the other 2 a cane. REaLLY! You're going to treat our elderly this way!"}
{"text":"The place Smells Horrible! They need a make over 100%. Thought it was at Entrance but it's the entire Restaurant. OMG! My Son shares the same observation."}
{"text":"Every now and then you have to go to Red Lobster but it really isn't anything special.  If it was not for the biscuits it wouldn't be worth the drive.  Service was good but we were the only ones in the back room at lunch on a Sunday.  I guess in Vegas if you want seafood you go to a buffet...........its cheaper."}
{"text":"I am so sick and tired of this place they don't answer the phone for takeout when you come they make you wait another 20 minutes for take out and then they charge you increase prices for Frozen Seafood I asked to talk to the manager and I think he was actually the guy hanging up on me when I was calling for takeout you never leave with spending less than $60 for two people and honestly they have no customer service and the one in Monroeville is extremely dirty I would not recommend this at all to anybody"}
{"text":"I went to eat at this restaurant for dinner and had high hopes for this restaurant. Unfortunately, it falls short and fails to deliver. When I walked in , I was greeted and quickly bought to our table. The restaurant decor is nice but boring. The server was nice, friendly and always ready to take an order. For apps, I had a New England Clam Chowder and a Fresh Ceasar Salad. The New England Clam Chowder had a good texture to it but was nothing special. It was not seasoned well and could be done better. The Ceasar Salad was not consistent. It is bland and not seasoned well. The bread crumbs were extremely hard and it was like eating a bullet :( . For my entree, I had the Shrimp and Scallop Alfredo. This was a mediocre dish and could be better if I liked Cheese. The dish was filled with a cheesy sauce that overpowered everything. The taste was overwhelming and I could not finish my dish. For dessert I had the Key Lime Pie. It was delicious. However, the dessert took a long time to arrive but it was worth the wait. Overall, this restaurant has major flaws that really makes it a restaurant not to go to. I will give it a 2 out of 5 stars."}
{"text":"I swear, someone chew my shrimp, then spit them out, then they were refrigerated for a week and then microwaved and served to me on top of  rusty iceberg salad next to this very doubtful boiled egg and a huge clump of blue cheese. Add some watery tasteless tomatoes and stale bacon, and you got yourself a salad for $10.25. I guess the patrons would advise me to order some crab meat or some other marine extravaganza, to be totally ripped and royally disappointed, but no thanks. I say $10 is a high enough price to learn my lesson and never eat there again."}
{"text":"Came here on a Wednesday night and everyone was super friendly. Got sat down right away, and our server was very professional. He answered any questions we might have. The food was delicious. I definitely came in with eyes bigger than my stomach. Had a lot of left overs. I ordered the pick 2 combination and it came with a nice side salad (either Cesar or House), then it came with another side (I got french fries), and then I chose the shrimp Alfredo and the coconut shrimp. Super good. Came out piping hot. Our server always make sure that our drinks were refill and we are always happy. Definitely will come again."}
{"text":"Really good endless shrimp dinner, they have 5 different types: Mediterranean shrimp, Nashville hot shrimp, shrimp linguine Alfredo, hand breaded shrimp and hand crafted garlic shrimp scampi. Also, you can order coconut shrimp even though it's not part of the endless shrimp menu. The service is decent and all dishes were delicious."}
{"text":"Wanted to go tonight.  Dining room, although a mess, had plenty of tables.  The sloppy looking hostess sat us practically in the kitchen. Was cold, smelled , so we walked out. Likely never to return!"}
{"text":"Stopped by here two times in one week. Yes I have a problem. Regardless, if you choose to come on a Friday or Saturday evening expect to wait half an hour for a table of 2 and... an hour for a table of 9 on a Mother's Day. We tried to make reservations ahead of time but they didn't take it. Luckily a cousin of mine figured out you can make reservations online ahead of time. It's on their website, you just need to tell them what time you expect to arrive when you actually do arrive. Our wait time went from an hour and a half to an hour which was expected but hey. Better than nothing.  Shrimp trios as advertised on the commercial was 19.99 and lobster feast was delicious! Ironically we didn't really order much lobster from red lobster only because my family prefers the Chinese lobsters more. I decided to try the lobster in the feast dipped with butter. It was so fattening but delicious! Wouldn't be able to eat it all the time but once in a while, why not!"}
{"text":"You outdid yourselves again Red Lobster.  I am completely stuffed and satisfied with the wonderful meal I just had.  I always order the Ultimate Feast, which is a nice sampling of all the different seafood that are most desired.  It includes the shrimp scampi, baked potato, fried shrimp, crab legs, and it's famous nice sized \"red lobster\".  All the food was excellent and it's never real loud like most other places.  Will keep coming back!"}
{"text":"Relatively cheap (for the quality of the food and the service you get).  Huge portions. Great service. A lot better than most Toronto restaurants."}
{"text":"It is a little expensive but cooking lobster at home takes time and it is a bit of a work. I had the Rock Lobster Tail with mashed potato and broccoli - it was good but the lobster was a bit overcooked and the portion isn't that big. Seaside Shrimp Trio was good too but a little salty. This location is pretty nice, friendly staffs, cozy interiors, with enough parking spaces."}
{"text":"Why do I always fall for the commercials that show juicy crab, lobster and shrimp!?  You'd think I would know better by now, I mean it is a chain.   My experience with chains are that the service is normally consistently good with over salted food, or bad with over salted food.  This experience was the latter.  The one thing I will say Red Lobster has going for it, is pretty delicious cocktails.  I am normally a beer and wine kind of gal, but their fruity beverages enticed the partner and I, so I went for the sangria and the partner went for the strawberry mojito.  Both were fruity and delicious with just the right amount of an adult bite.  I ordered the snow crab legs and they were good, but they were only steamed with no flavor.  The butter was too salty and the potato was overcooked. The partner ordered the lobster linguini with a Maine lobster tail on the side.  The lobster on both was over done and rubbery.  So if your jaw needs a good workout, I'd recommend it, otherwise save your Benjamins for something local with better quality."}
{"text":"My family was here because we had a gift card - we really would not have chosen to come here otherwise. Firstly, our waitress was extremely rude for the first half of our visit, and then changed her tune when it came time for us to pay the bill. Secondly, we were most excited for the cheddar bay biscuits, but were disappointed when we were told that they come to the table AFTER we order (when did that change?).  The food, of course, was not good for the price and portion sizes. We've come to expect that from Red Lobster. All in all, next time we're going to spend over $100 for lunch, we're not going to spend it here. I would probably give my gift card to someone else next time."}
{"text":"Awesome servers and great food. Service was quick and was able to get all question answered."}
{"text":"OK as a former red lobster employee I can guarantee that this is the shittiest red lobster in the city of Charlotte these assholes can't manage to sit a party and be able to enjoy a meal for my daughters 16th birthday"}
{"text":"I have been coming 3 times a week for lunch and choosing grilled fish and veggies to aid my diet plan. Service from 1115 to noon is great..food great..lost 20 lbs great..very nice server's."}
{"text":"I try something new every time we come here, but I always make sure to get some tasty lobster.  I love how the menu isn't too large, but always manages to stay fresh with new seasonal things going in and out.  The cheddar biscuits are wonderful and all of the dishes are cooked to perfection.  The lobster bisque here is absolutely to die for.  It's just as good as the bisque from any five star restaurant I've been to.  We had the stuffed mushrooms last time we were there and oh my goodness they were delicious.  The wait time is usually reasonable when we come here and the people at the front are always pleasant.  The only - and I mean only - issue I have with this place, is the waitresses.  The two waiters we've had now were absolutely delightful, but the waitresses were not!  They were forgetful, had bad timing and borderline rude.  I actually had to wait 20 minutes for a refill on water once which cost her a tip.  The other waitress totally forgot about us after serving our dinner and we had to ask someone else for to go boxes.  I told them I specifically wanted to tip the cooks and not the waitress as the food was wonderful and she was not.  And on a last note, my son will eat absolutely anything from here which is a miracle seeing as he's a picky eater."}
{"text":"Went to catch a bite after work. The stuffed mushrooms were great. This was the worst Clam Chowder I have ever had. It was like water milk and potatoes. I wanted clams."}
{"text":"Food was good, server did a good job, but the place is not managed well. I know they don't pick their customers but we ate  next to a table that had a screaming kid and a kid throwing food everywhere and after they left it was 20 minutes before they cleaned the area.  There was some confusion concerning the next customers to be seated as they were brought to the table that had not been cleaned yet and stood by or table waiting for their table to be cleanedfor a long time.  As they were final being seated another table was being seated behind us with another screaming toddler that also was jumping up and down on the seat common with mine. Her brother was playing a game machine with the volume loud enough it disturbed our ability to converse with each other."}
{"text":"Went her with a party of 4 and a 3 year old. We put our name down to wait, we were told 45 minutes. We waited an hour told there were not tables available yet, so we waited another 30 minutes. By this time myself and my friends are upset because others who came in after us have been seated. So we ask again about our table, they tell me that they accidentally checked our name of the list. They do not have there act together, it's a chaotic mess. I would my recommend it."}
{"text":"Location: close to the highway with an available  free parking lot.   Atmosphere: very dark   Food: delicious! However they should lighten up on the salt they put into the food along with reducing the amount of butter. Still very flavourful regardless of the dish choosen, however reducing the butter amount would not take away from the taste.  Their complimentary buns are also delicious, but you can taste a bit salty as well.  I do like it that they give you a salad along with your entree. At least the entrees we choose. There menu has a good selection of items. I did notice the price went up from the last time I was there, but I suppose that's inflation for you.    Service: impeccable!!!  I was genuinely pleased with the attention and friendliness that the waitress gave us. You could tell she enjoyed her job and gave 100% attention to detail and customer service. I wish I could recall her name. It is not common to find people who enjoy what they do and do it with a smile on their face even if it is late. We were there at 8:30 pm.   Overall: great service, great food, a bit pricey but everything else balances that out."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went to red lobster for a Valentine's date night. We ordered an ultimate feast, salmon, shrimp, and lobster, and a crab entree as take out. We ordered to sides of broccoli and two sides of mash potatoes. The ultimate and salmon meal both come with a side a rice. We did not receive our mash potatoes and only got a small spoonful of rice (maybe 2 mouths full of rice). I understand that it was Valentine's day and that they were busy, but when you openly complain about a customer trying to leave without paying, I expect to get all our food that we paid for."}
{"text":"Would have given a 5 star rating but was disappointed that I only got one scallop in the Bar Harbor Lobster Bake.  Other than that, it was DELICIOUS!!   Lobster was cooked to perfection, and the portion was plentiful.  Had to take most of it home.  My husband had the Parmesan-Crusted Tilapia, in which his portion looked smaller then pictured, but he said it was also delicious! Our children had the Seaside Shrip Trio, and they LOVED it!  The Lobster Bisque soup is always a favorite when we go there.  When we 1st walked in, the waiting area was packed!  They told us that it would be a 45 min wait.  We ended up only waiting for 25 mins.  Not bad if you ask me.  Staff was very accommodating, and friendly.  Drinks were refilled promptly.  Yes, I would recommend Red Lobster in Gastonia."}
{"text":"Standard Red Lobster fare. We dined in and had a good experience. The restaurant was a little dead, but the service was great and the staff was very friendly. I'll definitely do lunch here sometime."}
{"text":"We are here at least once a week! Good food, good service, and nice relaxing atmosphere,!"}
{"text":"Gross. Honest the soup taste like warm milky water. We seriously canceled our order and walked out."}
{"text":"VENUE/AMBIANCE (3.5) Located right at Bay and Dundas. Street parking and paid parking lots available within walking distance. Large dining area consists of many booths, round tables and some bar seating. Interior is starting to feel a little dated.   SERVICE (3) Friendly waiters, but very slow service. It's almost impossible to be in and out within the lunch hour. I love that they start you off with their fresh biscuits as soon as you order so there's something to eat while you wait.   FOOD (3.5)  The kitchen is kind of slow so be prepared to wait. Food always arrive hot and at the same time, which is greatly appreciated for groups. The crab linguine was tasty but a little heavy near the end. Shrimp tacos are always good as well. Honestly, you can't really go wrong with food at Red Lobster.    QUALITY/VALUE (3) Prices are starting go up here. There used to be 8.99 lunch specials but that's long gone. Lunches typically start at 11.99 now, which makes this more of a special work occasion for me.  OVERALL 3 stars - I would return."}
{"text":"This place sucks!! And they discriminate... If you're looking for respect don't eat here unless you're white, straight, and republican. When I got there the host told me to wait because it was busy but there was only 2 tables and 2 people at the bar but at least 4 servers so?? I was there for an interview which I'm definitely qualified for with at least 4 years of experience but after sitting down for only one minute the manager Don informed me that they couldn't hire me because I had a tattoo on my chest of script (nothing bad or offensive) even though I let her know that I wore the same uniform at another place I worked and you couldn't see it. Discrimination is illegal and you can't turn someone away because of that. After leaving I noticed they have mostly older people as servers..."}
{"text":"Food is excellent but unless you get Kim as your waitress idk about the service. Sara seemed like she was new or maybe she just didn't like my sister in law and I because she got her order wrong 2x then ignored us when we asked for water and was just not good at all with service . I asked was she new there but supposedly she been there 2 years ... yikes! Anyway Kim was wonderful she's friendly and great at serving we particularly came there to be served by Kim but unfortunately got stuck with Sara. Keep up the great work Kim and please train Sara !"}
{"text":"For starters Derek was an excellent waiter, couldn't have been better! The appetizers was delicious, we tried the shrimp, artichoke dip. My filet for the entree along with the shrimp skewers was made to perfection."}
{"text":"No stars for this place. The starter salad was all lettuce and croûtons with tasteless blue cheese dressing. The lettuce was cut up so mall that you could hardly use a fork. We had the calamari appetizer. Very little calamari and so much grease it pooled on the platter. The batter did not adhere. Sent it back. My entrée was haddock and chips. Again, too greasy to eat, both fish and fries. My wife had a platter. The fried shrimp was also too greasy, the shrimp alfredo was loaded with salt, and the scampi, while edible, was nothing to write home about. In the end, everything went back and we only had to pay for a beer and an iced tea. STAY AWAY!"}
{"text":"Had just about the worse service I had ever experienced tonight.  Started right after we got seated....I was there with my husband, our 22 year old daughter and our 15 year old son.  My husband and my daughter decided on a bottle of wine to drink, the waitress ID'd them.  My daughter didn't have her ID on her so she said forget it and my husband just ordered a glass of wine.   The waitress still insisted that my husband show his ID before serving him!  My husband was having a hard time finding his ID and he asked if she really needed to see it in order for him to have a glass of wine?  She said she did.....so he told her he would just have a Coke!   She then took our order and my husband and daughter just ordered a salad and soup while my son and I ordered a meal....nothing unusual and it took almost all of 45 minutes for us to get our food!  I understand the whole ID thing when a group of kids come in or something....but we were just trying to have a nice family dinner!  Probably will be awhile before we go back!!!"}
{"text":"The service was excellent as well as the food. Claire is an awesome server. She constantly checked on us to see if we needed anything. The best server we've had to date. Awesome job. Thanks Claire and Red Lobster!"}
{"text":"The service is really good here and the place is really crowded. My meal was unimpressive.  Chef Ramsay once said don't make it if your customers can do a better job at home.   I ordered Waynes favorite shrimp and the Fire fried salmon. Served up with your common-place fish sauce taken right out of the jar, the shrimp were dry and tasteless.  The salmon had a nice woody flavour but apart from that, was also very ordinary. Overpriced in my opinion.  Don't bother dressing up.  Wear any old thing even if it's your coveralls from work."}
{"text":"Ultimate feast is really delicious, enough for one person Biscuit is as amazing as always! lunch 9$ special is really good, especially the taco and hamburger, would not recommend the seafood linguini, not enough salt"}
{"text":"This Red Lobster location is great however the last time we were there we saw a fight that was kind of a buzz kill. But this time we had a peaceful tasteful dinner and the bartender was very friendly and fun."}
{"text":"Great food and service. The decor looks real nice (big step up from what it was a year or two ago). A little pricey (not too much though depending on what you order), but for what you get it is worth it. Definitely going to go back there in the future."}
{"text":"My husband and I discovered we had never been to Red Lobster last night and were exhausted by Home Depot so we decided to give it a try.  First off, our waitress was fantastic! No regret not getting her name.  She was a cherry, knowledgable, polite woman in her in 40s.  She gave us the run down and made the experience worth having.  The food was expected from a chain.  Reliance on heavy cream and butter without much subtlety.  But, we didn't expect an expert chef or perfect food, so we were not disappointed.  I'm glad we went, has great service, and left with leftovers to feed us all day and night."}
{"text":"My wife and I , came back for the endless shrimp special we placed our orders, and 15 minutes later we were informed that they were running behind in the kitchen and if we would like to order our second round of shrimp now to have it come out faster, I joked with my wife that our refill orders would come out before our our actual plate , turns out I was right and we revived our shrimp refills before our plate , you would think a manager would come up and apologize for that , but nope he was busy talking up the young hostess, it was Wednesday the 19th, Prior to this visit I had had nothing but superb service all the way around , good luck !"}
{"text":"Tried to eat here yesterday but it was too crowded so we came back. Walked in at 3:45 , and had to wait 1/2 hour because they didn't have servers. Ordered and another waitress brought our food out. Our waitress was busy helping another waitress and forgot about us. After waiting awhile, my husband finally got our waitresses attention . Decided to take his dessert home. Was so small it wasn't worth the effort. Will probably be the last time we're coming here!"}
{"text":"Took my baby girl to the Red Lobster last night. We shared a bunch of food and it was F'ing awesome!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed that they would NOT sell their lobster and shrimp Mac and cheese separately at ANY price. Comes only with two selections! Food was good service good."}
{"text":"We ordered the Lobster Fest lobster/shrimp grill which was served with lobster/shrimp macaroni and cheese and steamed broccoli. The wait staff was outstanding. The food presentation and taste was excellent and the price was a good value at $24. I can't speak for other Red Lobster locations but this one has a highly trained and motivated staff."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Went for a party and we waited 35 minutes to get a table while there were plenty of huge empty tables. Infact the table we got was empty for that 35 minutes. Once seated we waited about about 25 minutes for a waitress to get is drinks. When we asked someone who worked there to get is a waitress she said she would, we waited another 10-15 minutes. Food was cold and not very good."}
{"text":"I came in the other night with a couple friends and seriously had the best experience ever! Our server Jesus made it a fun and special night to remember. Hands down the best service I've ever received and all the food was delicious!.. and believe me I practically ordered a little bit of everything"}
{"text":"Sometimes it's not about the food even though the food was good.  We had the best and I mean the best waiter ever his name is Jesus and he will be an employee of Red Lobster almost 20 years and it shows he knows how to treat people and has such an awesome personality! We were never lacking for anything during our visit.  Not just Jesus was extraordinary but the Manager on duty was terrific as well Mike seemed abit shy but you can tell he has a goos spirit he went around to check on everyone to make sure all was well and when he came to our table he was very sweet!  I went to dinner with my oldest son which is always fun but in this case both Jesus and Mike made it better.  Always a joy to have three handsome sweet men around lol."}
{"text":"Great Service! The food was just on point. Only thing that I don't like this place is all the dishes seem taking forever to make . So little heads up don't come here when you are extremely hungry like me , lol!"}
{"text":"Nice food. I ordered tacos, and it became cold very quickly. I think they should provide hot food in the winter time."}
{"text":"Came in for my girlfriends birthday! Took a while to be seated (it was a Saturday night) anyway upon being seated I noticed we were super close to the restroom. No biggie until I noticed there were other tables that could accommodate our party closer to the front. The waiter was friendly but I can tell new. He didn't refill our drinks until after our dinner arrived (I asked him to do so) and never checked on us except to bring the check, take the order, and bring out the appetizers. When I asked him about singing happy birthday he did wish her a happy birthday but I had to remind him because he had already closed out the check and was ready to be done with us! The appetizers were delish, the salad was crisp, but my steak was cooked medium well when I asked for well done! Very pink and a little runny. My girlfriend had crab legs and let's just say they were a little to not so good. Never been to this location before but definitely wouldn't think of going back. I asked to speak with a manager and he/or/she took forever to come out. We just payed the bill and left. Not a great birthday for her sorry baby."}
{"text":"Super fast service waiter was nice and very helpful in  explaining the  menu.  EDWIN...We ordered the  shrimp trio... salad was just right biscuits delicious and our food was hot yummy and i ate it allllll feeling super  full.. great place great food"}
{"text":"Food was great. Nothing less than expected in terms of taste from Red Lobster. I got the Shrimp Linguine Pasta and my husband got the Fried Catfish and Broccoli. All was very tasty. I was a little disappointed in the size of the full dinner portion.  It was maybe half of a to-go container which I thought was small.  However,  I can be greedy so I was slightly biased.    Customer service was a 3.5, definitely could have been better initially. So,  I tried to call ahead my order and the front picked up but the next dept. (In assuming bar area) hung up the phone.  First strike!  Second, when I got to the bar area inside to place my order, I waited over 5 min and then had to ask someone to get someone to come to the bar area to take orders. Second strike! Lastly, which I look at as a \"ball\" and/or pass once my order was taken the bartender did offer me something to drink while waiting and I got extra cheese biscuits. Other than that no other service.    Would I go back, probably mainly because I love the Linguini Pasta and Red Lobster cheddar biscuits."}
{"text":"Red Lobster, Macleod trail gets one star because we got in right away. So disappointed!!! Like so many restaurants in Calgary, the quality of food is terrible. The presentation is horrible. For what R/L charges for all of their dishes, they should be ashamed!!!!!! We were there on Friday evening and it was so sad to see our dinners on the plate compared to the fancy pictures in their menu. My husband had the seafood trio and seriously, it looked like they took a handful of various seafood, pitched it in a deep fryer and then onto the plate. Even our waiter looked embarrassed to serve it to him. We decided not to make a big issue but to be sure, we will tell everyone we know about this terrible experience and will never go to any Red Lobster again."}
{"text":"I will start this post by saying that I have never been to Red Lobster before so I had no preconceived notions about this establishment. We arrived to find a plethora of people standing outside.  We went to the hostess booth and were told the wait would be 30 min for a table, so we promptly looked to see if there was a seat at the bar.  We waited at the bar for a longer than normal period of time and it was clear this place was ENTIRELY understaffed.  The bartender, Diana, was trying her hardest to fulfill orders from both the bar and tables.  She was so sweet and clearly stressed from some uncontrollable issue the restaurant was having.  Just about every party at the bar was upset because of a service issue.  I will stress, it seemed like there was a callout and a lack of management filling in the gaps.  Diana was fantastic and I feel terrible the stress fell on her!   Once we were seated, we waited for our server for quite some time. Once Brendon arrived, I asked if this restaurant was abnormally busy or if there were a lot of callouts. He explained that there were callouts, and some due to the election results...which I thought was crazy!!  We explained that we knew it was not his fault at all that the restaurant was a disaster zone.  He was so grateful and fantastic the entire night!  Kudos to the people that actually show up for work and have to take one for the employees  who bail at a drop of an unprecedented election."}
{"text":"Great experience with the new menu. The salads were fresh and crispy. The shrimp tacos were awesome. Kendra was our server and she gets 5 star's for her excellent and cheerful service. Thank you and see you next time. :-)"}
{"text":"The service was great! Since my family and I have been coming here for years, we decided to bring my mom here for her birthday, we enjoyed the Ultimate Feast, shrimp trio and some steak with lobster that my dad really enjoyed. The desserts were great, I'll be back."}
{"text":"Teresa P Place was great..awsome food as always!!! Been here so many times and keep coming back because of the food and the service, is the only seafood place that I like, always something new to try and quiet enough to relax and enjoy the meal."}
{"text":"Can you really get fresh seafood in the middle of the desert?  You can and this Red Lobster delivers fresh hot, steamy seafood.  The lobster is prepared to perfection, not to toughness.  Those cheddar bay bisquits are worth the trip alone.  So good that I'm not even ashamed to admit that I've stashed them in my purse.  Tip: dip the bisquits in some clam chowder and wow, it's like being transformed to an oceanside eatery.  Mmmm....  The service in Phoenix is above and beyond any Red Lobster in the Bay Area and Washington, DC, my old stomping ground.   As a matter of fact, EVERYWHERE we went in Arizona, the service and hospitality was so surprising GREAT.    No wonder so many relocate here.  Oy yes, I know, the immigration situation is an issue.  But hey, don't punish the hardworking man for trying to do right by you."}
{"text":"Why do we keep expecting more from this location?  The food is mediocre at best.  The service was bad, had to ask for drink refills.    Waitress did not know prices of drinks. Had to ask.   When asked about a birthday she said no, we don't do anything. Even though we had just seen another table get candles and the staff sang happy birthday, when we mentioned that she was very condescending and said \"well its not free\"     um hello..... did we ask for free?!    She did come through with ice cream and a song. But the experience was ruined.    Her first response to everything was no.      When it came time to pay the bill she kicked in overdrive, I'm sure hoping to save her tip.    For the price of Red Lobster I expect a nice experience.    Stick with the Angry Crab for now on.   At least it's fun!"}
{"text":"It gets a MEH from me.  Nothing spectacular here in my opinion, but it's ok if you want to eat safe seafood.  I think I may be a bit bias on this though because I am from Hawaii and I've had my fair share of \"Chicken of the Sea\", and the quality of the stuff from Red Lobster just doesn't even compare with what you can catch with your own bare hands from what basically used to be my own backyard.  I remember the days, parties with platters upon platters of raw, fresh sashimi (oh how I miss you hot mustard & shoyu!), places quality sushi, and the lovely aroma of fish tempura with a squeeze of lemon, some tartar sauce and Tabasco (Da Kitchen on Maui, that's you!)...but Red Lobster how you are none of these things.  On Maui, we don't even have a Red Lobster!  Freshness is everything when it comes to seafood, and for me it's not top notch at Red Lobster.  But, being a big chain I guess maybe it shouldn't be.  We ended up at Red Lobster mainly because of their heavily-rotated ads on TV, that 4-course seafood feast for $14.99.  The wifey wanted to try it out.  I hesitated but finally relented.  I should have hesitated then suggested somewhere else for dinner.  It wasn't bad per se, but man for the money you can do so much better.    I couldn't believe the wait at this place for a table.  Took us 20 minutes for us to get seated, and the place was PACKED.  Why all these people for mediocre seafood drowned in butter and cream?  Mind boggling I tell you.  Although I did see most folks were with their families, which makes for one big average bill.  No wonder Red Lobster stays in business.  Is is strange for me to say that our entire time there, I only saw 2 lobsters come out from the kitchen to our side of the restaurant?  And we were literally sitting a few tables away from the 'fresh' lobster tank that resides at the front of the place.  Made me a little uneasy.  Either folks don't feel like dishing out cash now for lobster (thanks, economy), or those lobsters aren't keeping up on the freshness meter.  With lobster being the bread and butter of Red Lobster, I now know why they probably introduced this 4-course feast to the lineup.  After ordering 4-course seafood feasts for the both of us, the wifey and I waited.  And waited.  And waited a bit more.  Took a good 25 minutes for our 1st and 2nd course to arrive.  And guess what, they forgot our friggin' Cheddar Bay Biscuits!  For shame!  I was looking forward to them.  Took another 15 minutes to get those.  I understand they were busy, but forgetting the biscuits to go with your soup?  Borderline ridiculous.  Plus, our salad and soup weren't that great either.  Not only was the salad on the tiny side, the lettuce on mine was a bit wilted.  Average at best.  Wifey had the clam chowder which actually had some clams in it but was overly salty.  I had the strange choice of chicken tortilla soup (yes, in a seafood shack) but it was actually not bad.  In no way authentic but at least it was seasoned right.  However, this soup with a Cheddar Bay Biscuit?  Not the greatest combination, ha ha!    Our 3rd courses were pretty average.  I love a good coconut shrimp and these were ok.  A tad on the overcooked side on the breading, at least the shrimp was not dry.  I liked my grilled honey BBQ skewers a lot better though.  Sweet, tangy, and juicy, they went great with a dash of hot sauce.  Thing I really hated on my dish?  Rice pilaf.  Why is rice pilaf served anywhere?  It is usually horrible!  I just can't get my taste buds to ever like it.  I liken it to having birdseed on one's plate.  It's useless!  Please afford me the luxury of choosing white rice or potatoes over this.  I would even take another steamed veggie over rice pilaf.  Rice pilar is PILAU!  That's Hawaiian for 'yucky'.  Wifey went with garlic alfredo shrimp and scallop pasta, and that wasn't much better.  It was a bit too creamy, very rich, and hard to finish in one sitting.  It had a decent amount of shrimp, but I'm not a fan of those itty-bitty baby scallops they put in it.  It's like scallop leftovers.  It would have been much, much better if Red Lobster had put 2 lovely scallops on top of the dish.  But I realize they have to cut corners somewhere to offer a decent price on your meal.  I actually enjoyed the 4th course the most, dessert.  We tried the triple chocolate brownie a la mode, and the apple crostada with caramel drizzle.  These actually were pretty good.  The brownie was gooey and not overbaked, and was yummy with the scoop of vanilla ice cream melting on top.  The apple crostada was good as well, flaky with a good amount of apples in the middle.  I only wish this was served a la mode as well.  Service was very slow but our waiter was apologetic so that made up for it.  But the food just wasn't up to par for me.  I would probably rather go to a local pub for a fresh batch of fish & chips, or to a down-home southern eats place here for some fried catfish with hot sauce.  Chain like Red Lobster?  MEH."}
{"text":"Five stars yet again. I do not usually visit chain restaurants much anymore, but my dad wanted to go here for his birthday dinner. So Red Lobster it is. And, fortunately, my mom had a gift card, as well. Even better!   I ordered the four course meal- offered Mon-Thurs, I think. You get salad, soup, entree with side, and dessert. I chose caesar salad, baked potato soup, steak with brussel sprouts and mashed potatoes, and brownie sundae. My dad got shrimp scampi. My mom got Walt's favorite shrimp. My brother got Admiral's Feast. Everyone, of course, indulges in the cheddar bay biscuits.  I was surprised with how much food I got with the four course meal. I couldn't eat it all. My dad ate some of the soup (he loves baked potato soup and I knew he would want some). My brother also assisted with the soup, steak, and sundae. Salad was meh. But that's ok. The soup was enjoyable. Steak was pretty nice for a seafood restaurant. Brussel sprouts were a bit overcooked, but quite good once I added a bit of salt. Mashed potatoes were fine. The brownie sundae was amazing. I was a bit nervous about it as I am not a huge brownie fan. However, I didn't want to pay the upcharge for a different dessert (it was $3 or $4) and my brother said he would help eat it. I really didn't want to share it once I had tried it, but I handed it over anyway. Everyone else liked their food, as well.  The young man serving us was quite good and patient with us as we were all figuring out what we wanted. Well, me, my mom, and dad. My brother gets the same thing everytime. We were even offered drinks to go. How nice.   Red Lobster is never first one my list, but we always have a great time when we go."}
{"text":"Normally you can't go wrong with red lobster. But every time I visit this location, I'm disappointed. After moving to the GTA a few years ago, we've visited this location 4 times but no more. Am I comparing it too much to the US, where the portions seem bigger, the dishes taste flavorful and  I leave the place fuller? Is it the high cost compared to other cheaper Asian seafood places I've been experiencing across Markham? Is it the dingy lighting and the damp, moldy smell or the old cutlery at this specific location? Is it the lacklustre greetings of our servers? Why do we have to ask them to refill the biscuits? And when they do arrive, why are they not piping hot and fresh? I advise not to go. Look up other places on yelp if you're craving seafood in Thornhill."}
{"text":"Took my dd today to eat around 5, the restaurant was empty. We were immediately greeted and seated upon entering. I ordered the Ultimate Feast, but subbed lobster pasta for Uncle Walt's shrimp (I hate coconut). DD had NY strip and lobster tail. Colleen told me there was an upcharge for the pasta sub, and helped dd pick which kind of tail was better. Overall, delicious food, enough left for two more dinners. I was surprised by the upcharge of $10. But it was an entire dish in itself. Fresh biscuits and FOUR takeout boxes, and we're still full. Colleen W was a wonderful waitress, keeping our drinks full, and clearing dishes without hovering. She deserves a raise!!"}
{"text":"Good typical fast casual seafood spot. It is considerably pricier than the US locations and I would have given it 4 stars if they had WIFI considering all the tourists in the area that dine here and would benefit from an internet connection. They make you beg for free biscuits, which is a shame as that is the best thing about Red Lobster."}
{"text":"I'm giving this review 2 stars only because the food wasn't so bad but I had dinner there today with my family (party of six) and the hostess, I believe her name was Gia was extremely rude to me and my father, she had a really nasty attitude. Our server Anthony wasn't bad except for the fact that he threw all 6 drink coasters from one side of the table as if he was dealing cards. I mean, I've been in the restaurant marketing business for over 10 years and have done business with over 50 restaurants and I've never seen such thing. Even if he was trying to be cool, that's definitely not the kind of service I expect from my server. I also overheard the table next to us complain about their server. Looks like they need to train their employees in order to provide better service. I'd like to go back there in the near future so I can write a better review but if I have to deal with this kind of service again, I'm done with this restaurant!  Thank you"}
{"text":"Staff was nice. We have been here about four times now. My son really likes the biscuits (who doesnt). My boyfriend's mom love it here to. I don't eat seafood but I still like it and can find something to eat. The staff has always been friendly and quick as well"}
{"text":"Service is great here.  We showed up at a busy time and were told it would be a 20 minute wait, but we were seated in about 10 minutes.  We both ordered shrimp and lobster dishes, but with different seasonings / flavours.  Food came hot, wait time was alright. Generous portions, and it should be considering the price. The shrimp was great, but the lobster wasn't anything special, but their biscuits were delicious. Same goes for the salad!"}
{"text":"My husband and I come here often and the food and service are usually pretty good but we mostly come for Tokyo teas by their awesome bartender Carlos!"}
{"text":"2 times I've been here and the only positive is the biscuits. Food is poor, prices are high and not worth it. Much rather go to an Asian restaurant and get good fresh lobster instead of this buttery lobster tail place. Shrimp was pretty bad too."}
{"text":"Food portions have decreased in size but remains good quality...service at the bar was not what I'm used to...and I actually don't require much.....Alan is a new young ass hole that was so rude I had to ask to be helped by someone else Rosa did a good job cleaning up his mess he put the order in wrong and then claimed that he was sick as well to Rosa so that's why he was being a jerk ...ummmmmm I can't act that way when I go to work so I don't except it from anyone else I am a 20 percent tipper all the time sorry Rosa tell Alan to grow the hell up life brings colds some time"}
{"text":"I come here for their cheesy biscuits. It is SO GOOD I can just fill myself with those for dinner. Sometimes I would just drop in, go to the bar and ask for a half or full dozen of cheesy biscuits to go. Because they're that good.   Well anyways, besides that, my boyfriend and I usually share the 4 course meal, where you get soup, salad, one entree, and a dessert. It fills us up and we can barely eat the dessert by the end of it. I usually get the coconut shrimp and pineapple grilled shrimp entree. The pineapple one has a spicy kick to it which is really really good. With all this food, it comes out to be ~$18 before tip for two! That's a pretty good deal.   I've had great service several times and good service the other times, but I've never had a bad experience. I will keep going back to this place for sure!"}
{"text":"I don't usually like writing reviews for chains but why not?  I came here for dinner today. The staff was nice. My food came out promptly.   I had one of their specials. For $18 I got a soup, salad, entree, and dessert. For the amount of food it was really affordable being sea food.  Their cheddar bay biscuits are crazy good as always.  We had a nice waiter. Wish she refilled my water more than once.  I did feel a bit pushed into the specials.   The whole shpeel(sp) at the beginning was a bit forced but I can't knock a girl for doing her job.  After having Joe's Crab Shack the night before I was pleasantly surprised and enjoyed dinner a lot better here.  The server/waiter went out of her way to help my dinner mate an affordable way for her to get a combo meal she wanted which I thought was very nice of her.  I would return because our food was prepared well, brought out timely, it was clean, and the server went out of her way to help us out."}
{"text":"I just stopped in for soup & biscuits while I waited on my daughter to get her hair braided. Well I was going to sit at the bar and it was the smallest most uncomfortable close sitting bar I've ever been to. I was not interested in being shoulder to shoulder with this man who was there 1st. I went back out and got seated alone at a table. My waitress was nice. Forgot her name. But they lost 2 stars because they discontinued the gumbo they use 2 serve. OMG!!!! That's like them cancelling their biscuits! Who told them to do this? When? Where? Why? I'm in shock. I really wanted to walk out, but wanted the biscuits like I was a dope fiend so I ordered the creamy potato soup. IT WAS GROSS I ate my 3 biscuits & left! I will probably never go back again!!!! I already wasn't a major fan, now they've taken my gumbo?  Damn them to hell!!!!!"}
{"text":"Team Tastic came here for dinner and we shared plates of the Island Jumbo Coconut Shrimp, the Fire-Grilled Lobster Salmon Shrimp, and the Admiral's Feast. All of these plates started with a basic side salad. Both the Jumbo Coconut Shrimp and the Admiral's Feast were plates full of deep-fried seafood. I was a fan of the fried scallops from the Admiral's Feast because they reminded me of chicken nuggets, but otherwise the fried seafood was a little too dry for my liking.  The jumbo shrimp were more batter than jumbo but had a good coconut taste in the batter. The fire-grilled lobster was pretty good, but maybe a little small compared to what's seen in advertisements and on the menu. Vegetables were quite watery but the best part of this dish is that it's not deep friend like a lot of items on the menu.  For dessert was a Warm Apple Crostada. This was basically a warm combination of an apple tart with a side of caramel and vanilla ice cream."}
{"text":"I was at Red Lobster yesterday for lunch with my mother for a \"late\" mother's day outing. The place was quiet on a Friday afternoon with seniors and some families.   I got my mum the \"create your lunch\" special for $9.99 (pick two - My mum picked garlic shrimp and breaded shrimp) and I got the lobster and shrimp pasta. For drinks my mum got a hot tea and I got the Long Island Ice Tea (2.5oz)   Our waitress Lisa was very friendly and attentive to our needs. The food on the other hand was mediocre at best. Red Lobster to me felt like the Swiss Chalet for seafood. My pasta was way too greasy and the plating for the \"create your own\" looks like something out of a cafeteria in high school.   Having been to Red Lobster before I know I shouldn't expect fancy 5 star food or anything. but I simply feel the presentation could use some work. After all they did re-brand their logo (its black background instead of the navy blue), so why not give a little bit more attention to your food?"}
{"text":"Went to the red lobster for the sweetest day and it was great.      I ordered lobster nachos, berry mango daiquiri and endless shrimp. My friend ordered iced tea and endless shrimp. After all of that we paid less then $60 (tips are cash so I don't usually include in the meal price).    There were pretty a lot of people but our waitress  was excellent. The manager was on the floor all the time and checking that the people were getting the proper service.     Food was really good especially the new Parmesan shrimp and the lobster nachos. There was a little wait issue but nothing bad."}
{"text":"It was pretty good for Red Lobster. I can't pass up the AYCE shrimp special around this time of year :)"}
{"text":"Went in for lunch on Sunday and immediately sensed that something was fishy. Haha! The host was very friendly, we had to wait while they got a table ready because we were with a large group. It was done in a timely manner. I had the blackened catfish with broccoli. Waitresses name was Donna and she did a great job."}
{"text":"For a ghost town of a shopping center, this Red Lobster is busy.  It's always busy, especially during lunch.    Once you get past the mini-wait, everything starts to fall in place.  Service at this Red Lobster has always been great.  There have been times I've come here on a limited lunch break and told our server. To my surprise, they did what they can to get me and my group in & out.    On my most recent visit, I was craving a steak and also lobster. Then I found what I thought was perfect.  It was their Lobster Steak meal.  But if you've been here before, you know what this is. It's steak with lobster bits on top. I expected a lobster and a steak.  My bad, I should have read the menu better.  Also, the price was fair.    As for their other food choices (from previous review):  -Bottomless Shrimp:  I don't know if this is daily or all the time.  But I have had it in the past.  Their fried shrimp has more batter than shrimp, but still pretty good.   -Seaside Shrimp Trio:  Is a favorite when in the mood for shrimp.  It's shrimp pasta, fried shrimp, and garlic shrimp  -Tilapia and Cod  I put these all together, but their cod is really good.  Big thick pieces of flaky fish.  Tilapia is prepared pretty good to.  Both are not fishy.    -Steaks:  Mixed reviews here.  I've had steaks here prepared either too dry or too greasy. The steaks are not as good as a Ruth Chris' but definitely better than a Chili's or Denny's.   -Lobster:  My opinion, one of my favorites.  Portions small though.  -Stuffed Sole:  Tried once and only recently.  Did not fill me up, but still good.  Order an appetizer!!  -Glazed Chicken:  I know it's a seafood restaurant, but have stopped by for lunch just for their chicken breast.  About 7 total oz and usually have the sauce put on the side.  -Calamari and Fried Vegetables:  An oxymoron, but you'll find it all gone before your soup arrives.  Usually gone from me and yes, the only way I will eat vegetables.   -Red Lobster Biscuits:  Don't remember the actual name, but this is a must on every visit.  So good and perfect to dip into you chowder.   Overall, I recommend Red Lobster. I've never had a bad experience and you get what you pay for her. Price for seafood here is just about right for the quality you get.  Just be prepared for a little wait at this location."}
{"text":"Of course it's no surprise, Red Lobster isn't the best seafood place around but it's generally consistent and the food isn't bad. And who doesn't love the cheddar bay biscuits. (I've tried making them at home from the kits and they're just okay. Meh.)  My husband and I have found ourselves at this location 4 or 5 times due to receiving gift cards. I think the restaurant's set up is one of the nicer ones - with a larger bar area and a few \"rooms\" with mostly booths. We have always had a decent meal and friendly service. (Although, I have noticed that prices have gone up a bit.)  My two biggest issues are, one, the parking area, which is somewhat chaotic and difficult to get in and out of. The second is the wait time. I'm rather impatient to begin with and generally do not care to wait to eat. I prefer to go earlier or later than lunchtime / dinnertime to avoid crowds and waiting. However, it seems no matter what time we've gone, we have had to wait an abnormally long amount of time. Went on a Monday at 7:45pm....had to wait. Went on a Wednesday afternoon at 3pm-ish...had to wait. It seems like the times we have had to wait, the wait time simply didn't need to be as long as it was. I have seen plenty of tables un-bused just dying to be cleaned and 2 or 3 hostesses sort of standing around. I would normally just say forget it and go somewhere else, but the gift cards! the gift cards! ...ya know?"}
{"text":"All I see is a bunch of mixed reviews for this specific location.  For me, I think this was one of the better Red Lobster's I've been to and I've been to a lot.  Most of the Red Lobsters I've been to in California always include a long wait.  I have yet to wait more than 10 minutes at a Las Vegas/Henderson Red Lobster.  Let's start with service.  Been to this specific location about 4 times.  I remember one time meeting a friend here 30 minutes before they closed.  I showed up in time, but she was running late.  She showed up 10 minutes before closing and the restaurant still managed to serve us with a smile and no attitude.  I know, that's their job, but a lot of restaurants show that they are not happy when you arrive minutes before they close.  They kept the kitchen open for us even after closing.  What I will never forget is that they continued to check on us and basically asked permission if they can shut certain parts of the kitchen down.  Now, that's good service.   -Food:  If you have not been to Red Lobster before, they offer basically what any other seafood restaurant offers.  They specialize in price because it's much cheaper to eat seafood here than any other seafood restaurant (no don't Long John Silvers).    -Bottomless Shrimp:  I don't know if this is daily or all the time.  But I have had it in the past.  Their fried shrimp has more batter than shrimp, but still pretty good.   -Seaside Shrimp Trio:  Is a favorite when in the mood for shrimp.  It's shrimp pasta, fried shrimp, and garlic shrimp  -Tilapia and Cod  I put these all together, but their cod is really good.  Big thick pieces of flaky fish.  Tilapia is prepared pretty good to.  Both are not fishy.    -Steaks:  Mixed reviews here.  Had steaks here come too dry.  Had some come too juicy. Then had some just right.  Not as good as a Ruth Chris' but definitely better than a Chili's or Denny's.   -Lobster:  My opinion, one of my favorites.  Portions small thought.   -Stuffed Sole:  Tried once and only recently.  Did not fill me up, but still good.  Order an appetizer!!  -Glazed Chicken:  I know it's a seafood restaurant, but have stopped by for lunch just for their chicken breast.  About 7 total oz and usually have the sauce put on the side.  -Calamari and Fried Vegetables:  An oxymoron, but you'll find it all gone before your soup arrives.  Usually gone from me and yes, the only way I will eat vegetables.   -Red Lobster Biscuits:  Don't remember the actual name, but this is a must on every visit.  So good and perfect to dip into you chowder.   Overall....I think you get more than what you pay for at this restaurant.  Regarding service,  I've always had good service.  One of the reviewers mentioned poor service because they were seated after someone that came in later. I have to admit, they once or twice, have done that for me. I'm not a regular or a baller, but sometimes it can be due to how big your party is and how you talk to them. Ha ha..flirting can go a long ways sometimes."}
{"text":"Our waitress was way too talkative, had 2 other people come up to us before we could even eat. Food was alright... but not up to par with the price. Boo! Never going back!"}
{"text":"I got lunch here the other day with a friend and had an awful time.  Food was a 1.5 at best and the wait was ridiculously long. Double ugh.  My friend and I ordered two dishes to share.  I got the shrimp skewers with rice pilaf and green beans, and she got the pick-two combo with grilled salmon and coconut shrimp.   We had a great start with piping hot biscuits, but it was all downhill from there.  We waited 10-15 minutes for our salads - I got coleslaw - and an hour for our meals.  Yes, an HOUR!  I thought I was going to start eating my hand.  Keep in mind that it wasn't a lunch rush by any means.  We were like, one of 5 tables in the restaurant.  I have no idea what happened, but I probably could've gone and fished my lunch faster.    To make matters worse, the entrees were awful - definitely NOT worth the wait.  My friend's salmon was WHITE. What the eff? When has salmon ever been white?  The taste was off, too.  Just a bad experience overall, although I give them props for their coconut shrimp - the only redeeming part of the meal.    Anywho, our waitress felt bad we waited so long so she brought us dessert on the house.  She's the reason this RL got even TWO stars.  If you're looking for a place to eat, go to Cheesecake or CPK.  Seriously."}
{"text":"Red Lobster has been  the go-to place for my Mothers birthdays & anniversary for many years, recently we revisited this location after several years of using either the Yonge-Steeles or Downtonwn (Bay st) branches.   Turns out this location has a great advantage over Yonge-Steeles for getting parking because it doesn't share the lot with a bunch of other popular places. Also they seem to have upgraded the ventilation in recent years, and seem to do a better job of keeping the carpeting & upholstery from having that stale smell which often haunts old restaurants & pubs.    Food & service is pretty consistent among th 3 locations we've gone to, but I will say they seem extra eager to please, as they brought a refill of biscuits without asking. And when I told them not to remove my coleslaw because I wanted to finish it together with the meal, the guy just brought me another one.Nce touch!"}
{"text":"Isn't this fantastic that we can voice our real opinions so just maybe this restaurant chain will wake up? Literally hospital cafeteria level quality! Hadn't eaten at a Red Lobster in years. The salad was iceberg lol..shrimp??? Tiny greasy crumb coated cheap junk! My husband's soup was so watered down with zero flavor or any clams to be found, he took it back. I understand this is a chain but come on! Better shrimp at Rubio's tacos!!"}
{"text":"We were there on Thursday 5/24/2018 around 7 pm.   I have to say the cook/Mgr? whomever he was specifically came to my table because I had ordered the \"crusted\" shrimp (which was as available) and indicated that they were out of that special (since it was on the special and there was only 3 days left) and they did not reorder it, however, he would make me up something similar by hand.  WOW  It was delicious!! it should be on the menu. So they not only substituted the special but gave me extra.  I was so impressed, then came the bill.  Our waiter, when taking my order, was asked if I could have a cup of soup instead of the salad. \"NO PROBLEM\".  He also asked me to pick a side, since I was having the 3 entree special , I asked what the options were, he said on the last page so I picked the asparagus.   After reviewing the bill I find that he charged me 2 or 3  $$ for the soup and $3 for the asparagus.  When I question him, he said OH YEAH there is an \"UP\" charge for the soup and for the asparagus!!!  Why did you not tell me that when ordering. \"Because when I do tell people there is and UP charge, they get defensive and say well I have money and can pay for it\".    Needless to say his tip was not the greatest.  I might have say OK anyway, but I deserved to have the choice.  The food was magnificent  and came within the appropriate amount of time. Will definitely return.!!!"}
{"text":"I really can't imagine what could be making it so slow here.  Just got back from dinner which took over 2 hrs. It doesn't seem like the waitstaff, the servers are hustling... I hate to blame the kitchen, but I think it's the kitchen.  Plus my Caesar Salad had slimy wilted lettuce."}
{"text":"We used to eat at Red Lobster once a month but no longer. Prices have gone sky high and quality is poor to lousy. If you want more than a single side (un-cooked broccoli) you pay extra. If you want a good sea food experience try Angry Crab. It is very apparent that Red Lobster is trying to cut cost and their meals show it. We are sorry to see them go because we do not have a lot of good seafood choices in Mesa, AZ. We can only hope they go back to their old way of doing business."}
{"text":"Great food and awesome service from our server Dorian T. We had the Stuffed Flounder, Cajun Tilapia, Buffalo Strips, Calamari  and Salads. Everything was Perfect !   They really Wowed us tonight - When we first got there my daughter was sad when she found out that there were no more Lobsters left in the Tank. However she left the restaurant smiling when our server Dorian came to our table (along with a 3 other servers) singing a Christmas song to my Daughter. They brought her an Apple Dessert with a candle in it. My Daughter  is only 7 but after such a great experience tonight she now wants to have her next Birthday party here :-)"}
{"text":"I usually like coming to this location because I feel the servers and chefs are better. This location is pretty busy as well, usually have to wait for 15-20mins for dinners on week nights.  The newly revamped menu is a little awkward to look at, especially when I see the first half is filled with alcohol options! Whatever makes the highest margin I guess."}
{"text":"Had the ultimate feast. It was anything but ultimate. First of all, the messed up the order.  Then the lobster was rubbery, and the crab legs were ice cold.  Worst Red Lobster experience ever.  If you wanna have good seafood, don't stop here."}
{"text":"One thing about Red Lobster is consistency.  It is always great.  I have visited this establishment at least 25 times spanning 30 years.  The service is always attentive.  We have been here with larger parties and have always been well taken care of."}
{"text":"I used to love coming here as a kid but recently the service and quality of the food has went downhill. I ordered the endless shrimp with a side of mashed potatoes and caesar salad. My father ordered the same meal. After taking about 15 minutes for the salad and biscuits to come out, we waited another 35 minutes for our food to come. Both of our sides of mashed potatoes were cold and we were told that there was only one worker in the kitchen. We asked for another side, which we expected to be piping hot. The second side of mashed potatoes were cold as well. The server was apologetic and said the manager was going to take care of us but we haven't spoken to a manager at all. After such a disappointment, I don't plan on returning to this location."}
{"text":"I'm gonna give two stars. One because I have to and the other for our server (holly?) who was great. The food however had me less than impressed. I took 3 bites and have to throw this 30 dollar meal down the drain. I got the lobster surf and turf and can't even stomach it. My plate is so oily and greasy, the steak is SO bloody and I asked for medium, and biting into the lobster felt like rubber. NEVER again. Who knows when the next time I'll be able to eat seafood again is, this ruined it for me :("}
{"text":"Red Lobster. It's the seafood equivalent to Applebees, Chili's, TGI Fridays...you know those chains. These places won't kill you with food poisoning but their food will generally be a level of 'whatever' that makes you reconsider why you spent 33 bucks on the crazy entree roulette wheel deal.   I'm not a huge fan of fish or lobster unless I am near an ocean. There is no disappointment like getting gross fish. They had advertised a lobster roll sandwich deal. It sounds tempting but I know this game of disappointment.   I went with tried and true popcorn shrimp and friend shrimp combo. I played the odds. It's hard to really mess up shrimp. If you get a bad shrimp, well, next one will be better. The popcorn and fried shrimp are basically the same thing, just different sizes. The cocktail sauce was just sad. Not a dab of horse radish to be found in that sauce. Eating shrimp and not getting a sinus clearing blast of horse radish? It didn't matter. We all know why most people go to Red Lobster anyway.  DEM CHEDDA BAY BISCUITS.   I filled up on dem biscuits. Mashed potatoes had some garlic flavor in there. My Italian dressing needed more salad, but I guess that's my fault for not asking for dressing on the side. I made the right choice in the end. \  Other people got the lobster roll combo. While everyone else's salads came out, they explained that the salad comes with the lobster roll itself. When the roll did come out, it was apparent why the salad came with the meal. The lobster roll was tiny, even for roll sandwich standards. It also came with approximately 7 french fries. The lobster looked closer to imitation crab meat. I thought to myself, \"at least I didn't spend so much money on my disappointment.\""}
{"text":"Service: 2.5/5 We came here on Monday afternoon, and it was not busy. We were seated by a lady to a booth in the middle, but we found it was too narrow for us to seat with a baby, so we asked if we could do a switch to the corner booth, the lady was obviously very unpleasant, but finally we did get switched.   However, the waiter who served us was very patient, nice and helpful, I'm gonna give him 5/5 stars.   Food: 5/5 We ordered three seafood feasts, although it took a while to get them, the food was really delicious and deserved 5 stars. Mash potatoes was very creamy, Cesar salad was tasty and my baby enjoyed it a lot. The seafood was very fresh, and it's my likings.   Interior: 4/5 Many comfortable booths and the environment here really fit those who would like to have a big seafood dinner with the whole families.   Definitely will come back on holidays!"}
{"text":"My family has been visiting Mcknight road Red Lobster for over 25 years. My oldest child loves to visit for his birthday. He is 25 now. I was so disappointed. As we walk in the hostess is eating mouth full and chewing very sexy!  We are looking at all you can eat shrimp on T.V. and we go there and it was not the special.  I   enjoyed the biscuit but my Cesar salad was so sad. I go there for that reason. Our mash potatoes were instant who serves instant taters on $80.00 lunch bill plus tip? Our waiter was not informative and absent. We ended up taken our food home. My son is 6'4 at 250lbs. He could put away 5 meals. It was tasteless and shameful. My youngest didn;t even want the shrimp. He has been eating shrimp his entire life. In todays economy and money being so tight this type of serves will close doors quick. As we exit there are at least 6 staff members smoking out the back door. Maybe they should take that time to make fresh mash taters. I will try out Butler Red Lobster but with reservations. As for the shitty lunch we received at the Mcknight restaurant we won't be back. Not to mention I made all you can eat shrimp and crab legs for 3 people for just under $30.00. My family was stuffed germ free and we never left our home. The point is we go out for the serves and atmosphere when big chains loss that they are failing in a big way."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came in tonight and we had a wonderful server. She was super attentive and sweet. I think her name was Celeste? Will deff be back and will be asking for her!"}
{"text":"I went here for Mother's Day! This place is so dark I can't even see my food.the customers were rude and kept looking at my family because we had little children with us and they were being kids!!!!"}
{"text":"The lobster lovers dream was outstanding!  Can't get enough!  Alicia was awesome!  Request her as your server!"}
{"text":"Nice and quiet dining room at this location.  I finally tried this place last week and it was pretty mediocre in terms of the food quality and taste.  I had their signature fried shrimp and popcorn shrimp that left me feeling thirsty prompting to me gulp down water as if I finished a 10 K marathon so be prepared to guzzle down water as it is fried food afterall.  Aside from the shrimp, I had their alfredo spaghetti dish with chicken which tasted a bit rubbery."}
{"text":"ZERO STARS WOULD BE BETTER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Dear Red Lobster, Where to begin.....I wait for a long time to enjoy my meal here EVERY year for my birthday, and a few other occasions throughout the year....This time, on Saturday, my birthday we went to the Surprise, AZ location.....hungry and excited to have our long awaited birthday meal and to say I was MORTIFIED would be an incredible understatement, from the aggressive manager, the waiter that literally NEVER came back, to the half order that was repeated to him 2 times, to the drinks that were never refilled and to the 3, yes 3 biscuits we were given......THAT was the highlight of the meal......but the best part of it all was the table THAT I HAD TO CLEAR MYSELF, AND TAKE TO THE KITCHEN AREA AND GAVE TO A SERVER THAT LOOKED SO SHOCKED THAT I HAD TO CLEAR THE TABLE BECAUSE THE SERVER NEVER EVER CAME BACK....NOT ONCE!!!!! AND THERE WAS MAYBE 30 PEOPLE IN THE RESTAURANT THE WHOLE TIME SO I GUESS CHATTING AND DISAPPEARING WAS OF MORE IMPORTANCE.... The sad excuse for a manager is very aggressive, and argumentative towards us in regards to the order....I ordered the \"extra add on\" of a Maine tail to my crab legs (which were SO SO SO cold that they could have literally been grabbed straight from the ocean and slapped on a plate) and being the \"add on\" tail says Maine tail, I assumed it would be butterflied, or fluffed....NOPE they took it upon themselves to decide how I wanted that cooked, and grilled it....I spoke to the manager about it and again she was argumentative to the point that I had to bring the menu out and show her....I know what the add on tail looks like, and that is so NOT what I got!!!!!! I know Red Lobster went through some changes in trying to better the customer experience, but really?? to MAKE a customer clear their own table is just disgusting!!!!! I was so incredibly mortified by this experience, and the manager KNEW I had to clear the table, because the server that I handed the dishes off to quickly told her and she made her way to our table....but NOT to apologize, or try and make it right.....nope, she came ONLY to drop off the check for $155.00....No comp for all the horrible lack of service, not even a refill on our drinks to go, not a doggy bag (had to ask Trevor for one of those too) NOTHING.....just a bill for $155.00 for quite possibly the worst dining experience.....so so so disappointed, upset, and horrified that this is my birthday memory this year....."}
{"text":"My family and I have always loved Red Lobster! This location specifically..but safe to say that after this last time we dined there we will not be going back..  The food has gone tremendously down hill..a dish such as the lobster alfredo (my personal favorite) had so little sauce and the most bland taste..which is not at all how it once was..depressing cause it used to be so addicting and now it's a completely different tasting plate. My mom ordered the king crab legs and was disappointed, they didn't look or taste fresh I guess.. The lobster bisque was decent, just wish it had been a little bit hotter when it came out..  As for the service, our waitress was great. I having plenty of experience working in restaurants know what good service is supposed to look and feel like and that is exactly what we got. So props to hiring good servers I'll give them that.. If only the food was like the staff..then maybe we'd go back. Oh well. Just going to have to find a new favorite seafood restaurant, any suggestions? Haha.."}
{"text":"Dear Red Lobster,   There are other flavors besides butter and garlic.   This food was horrible. The only think saving it from one star was the non-horrible service.   Those stupid biscuits were hard, heavy and taste exactly like Cheez-its.   We ordered one of the feasts and an appetizer. EVERYTHING was super greasy and drowning in butter. The scallops were rubbery and everything was so rich we left feeling like we had eaten bricks. The feeling lasted for 5 hours until I was finally able to fall asleep.   Red Lobster: Not Even Once."}
{"text":"My wife had the feast. Did not like the crab legs the lobster was great the shrimp was average. I had the Ny steak. The steak was average. Service was friendly but the food came out cold and had to send it back. If we could I would give it 2 1/2 stars"}
{"text":"Great food horrible service :/ be prepared to wait 30 minutes for a drink order! After waiting another 20 minutes we found out our order wasn't even getting cooked?! Wow. Ordered my own water at the bar. Ridiculous! Never coming back!"}
{"text":"Red lobster is so awesome. I get excited when my husband takes me out here. Really just for one reason which is kind of sad but I love the Sunrise Pina Colada drink. Its sooo freaking yummy! :) I've ordered the wood fired salmon, snow crab legs and garlic butter shrimp. Decently priced for seafood."}
{"text":"We went there for lunch and had shrimp salad along with shrimp skewer rice and clam chowder. The service with Rachel was excellent. It was not the most tasty shrimp ever but quite acceptable. The lettuce was fresh though I prefer dark greens instead of iceberg. If you're looking for a well run red lobster, this is it."}
{"text":"This is my first bad review.. but, I have to say something.. I have been to Red Lobster several times, and it's usually ok, so, maybe it's just this location. Anyway, my Dad and I ate here the other night, the shrimp were limp and soggy, and the brussels sprouts were burned and actually crunchy and hard! How do you screw up brussels sprouts?? We both got the flounder, and it was soggy too! The only thing that was decent, was the muscles my Dad ordered. Anyway, there are many other good restaurants to chose from, I will not be going back to this one."}
{"text":"Food was good and the service was great. I may have made a comment & the waitress overheard, within a few moments the manager was at the table assuring I was happy with my order. Jazmin the waitress was very sweet & never let our drinks go empty. Carrie thank you for assuring we were happy with our order, yes the food was delicious & we will be returning to this location. I'm very impressed with the service and thanks for treating my little one to ice cream!"}
{"text":"Very awesome and affordable lunch menu. 3 tacos and a side for $7.99 plus the incredible cheddar biscuits. Definitely a go-to for a tasty, non-fast food , affordable option."}
{"text":"Crab legs are over cooked with barely any meat inside ( not even meat more like crab flavored foam!) only thing I liked was the mashed potatoes. If you are craving crab legs then this is not the place to go to."}
{"text":"Bad day? I don't know. I've had better meals at other Red Lobster restaurants. The only good thing about tonight's experience was the waiter, Bryan. Fast, efficient, polite and funny, just how I like it. We had a Lobsterita (huge margarita) and shared it. Regretted it too, since it was way too sour and had a chemical taste to it. I couldn't take but two sips and then I switched to something else that I knew it'll taste much better, water. The salads were made with wilted lettuce and sore looking tomatoes. Croutons were ok. The all too familiar hot bread was good, as it is always. The main dish, a medium cooked steak and grilled shrimp was delivered on time. Steak was chewy at best, although the marinade's taste was ok. Shrimp were grilled well, not too much or too little. My wife's shrimp scampi was absolutely tasteless, overcooked shrimp in some sort of shrimp juice, with very little butter and no garlic. Pretty horrifying if you ask me.  I think this is the last visit we're going to pay to this location. As I said before, I've had much better meals there and I cannot justify the bill when we are not satisfied with the quality of food. Too bad..."}
{"text":"Husband and I went to this location for the first time today. The restaurant is super clean with friendly staff. Our waitress Taylor was just amazing. She was so nice, I will ask for her the next time we go. She knew how to take care of her guests/customers. That's the only reason why I gave this a 5 star rating.. Downfall was my salad that was under the chili shrimp there was a bug on the lettuce wings and all  I wasn't eating anymore of that. The manager was very nice and took care of it all for us. Just for that we will give them another try"}
{"text":"Great dinner tonight. Unlimited shrimp, yummmm! Thank you Linda for the excellent service this evening. Will return."}
{"text":"Well the stars don't lie, this place isnt so great. I can say I didn't have an issue with the staff, everyone seemed pretty cool and friendly. We sat at the bar and the bartender acknowledged us when we sat down. Got us menus and water right away and gave us some time to look over the menu. We ordered the lettuce wraps, mushrooms and mussels. Well every review you read on hear is pretty accurate about how crap the food is, except the biscuits they were actually good and not salty like some people claimed. The wraps were okay but the breeding on the shrimp was over seasoned, the mushrooms are pretty much frozen and fried, I've gotten better shit from the freezers at the whole in the wall grocery store with expired labels... I was poor at a point in my life don't judge.  And the mussels were dry not seasoned and COLD! SICK! I really do yelp places to read reviews as well as rating and I would have not even given this place a chance to prove their horrible rating but the fact that I got a gift card for this place was the only reason I even stepped foot in here. Will i return? NO will I recommend to people I know? HELL NO... WOULD I RECOMMED IT TO THE YELPER READING THIS RIGHT NOW? F##K NO! This place is a chain known accross the country where the hell is the marketing department from the corporate office in finding out why their location sucks balls and has a rating less than a motel 6?!? SMH"}
{"text":"We went that restaurants with a few friends, it was my first time to Res Lobster and I have to say that I have been missing a LOT. This place is simply amazing, except for the fact you may wait for hours to get a table but that was understandable since it was Saturday night. The food is simply amazing, the service was quick and pleasant. I'm just waiting for a chance to go back. I'll try to make a reservation before I go though. Totally recommend."}
{"text":"I am not a huge fan of chain restaurants, but it was most convenient for meeting a relative.   Seating at 5:30 was easy with no wait.  We ordered drinks which took exceptionally long to get back to the table.  I tried the new salmon oscar with crab cakes and shrimp, mashed potatoes and grilled squash.   The salmon was way undercooked which doesn't appeal to me.  The crab cakes were just mushy.  The shrimp on top of the crab cakes was good.  Mashed potatoes were fine and squash was just ok.   All 3 others were just ok with their meals.  The best thing was the cheddar biscuits.     Service was slow for refills and check and they weren't even busy yet.     Not in a hurry to return."}
{"text":"Terrible service but great food.  Made us wait 30 minutes for our check and box. Also barely checked on us, and we asked for a refill on our waters but only gave us one extra water. The busser was a better \"waiter\" than our actual waiter."}
{"text":"Ryan W. was honestly the best server we've had in a long time. He treated us amazingly! He was very attentive. And paid close attention to when it was time to give us our next course. He definitely deserves a raise or premotion!!!"}
{"text":"Went in for endless shrimp and I have to say that the service was far and away the best we have received.  Friendly, prompt and attentive. Would recommend this for anyone looking for a quick seafood fix."}
{"text":"Skip this Red Lobster location. Drinks remained unfilled the entire meal. No cheddar biscuits brought out until after our entrees were brought out. Waiter showed up three times and blamed the chef for problems. Wait staff commented on the scantiness of vegetables. It seemed we waited for everything: to be seated, to order, to pay, etc."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here for lunch on a Saturday. We were greeted and seated immediately upon arrival. Our Waitress, Kaylee promptly came to our table to take our drink orders. The décor is nautical, and the atmosphere is moderately noisy.  After looking over the menu, I decided on the clam chowder and the shrimp salad. Our waitress brought some cheddar biscuits. The biscuits are yummy! My soup was brought out in a timely fashion. I really didn't care for their clam chowder. I have had better, but with a pinch of salt, some pepper and crushed crackers, I enjoyed it. My salad was delicious. There were seared shrimp served on a bed of crisp greens, tomatoes, cucumbers with oil and vinegar (my choice) for dressing. YUM!  I would say my experience here was A-OK. Not great, not bad, just okay."}
{"text":"Poor service. Hostess more interested in their text messages than serving. I sat in the bar area for 14 min w/o being acknowledge. Finally asked for a \"real seat\" hoping for better service. The seated service was better but I will not be back."}
{"text":"This review is for the service... It was so horrible. I love red lobster and its shrimp fest now so i was very excited to go! BUT... this was the worst experience ever.  1) Server didn't come to our table for about 10 minutes after we sat down (we came at about 1pm so it wasn't that busy) 2) Our appetizer did come until after about 15-20 minutes (it wasn't even hot, but it was warm). 3) Had to ask the server twice to refill our water after he already told us he would be right back. 4) My wife got her entire meal 15 minutes before mine came. She finished her first serving of shrimp before my food arrived and I only got a soup and salad!  5) My wife's second order of shrimp took about 20 minutes, 3rd order the same - we spent 1 1/2 hours here and most of that was just waiting and waiting for our food and drinks.  What was upsetting is we had to consistently ask the server for more water and where our food was and he would come off as if he was just as shocked as we were, \"Oh my, you didnt get it yet?\" No! We told you 3x already that we don't have water and are still waiting for our food and you keep telling us your going \"right now\" and then never come back! He even offered to get the Manager to come over and we agreed and wanted to talk to him and the server must have forgot that too because the Manager never came. Granted, he did claim he was fairly new but someone should at least be helping or shadowing him or at least check with customers on their service with new servers.  Love red lobster but will not be coming back to this location."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with my wife. This location is my favorite in Las Vegas (haven't had great experiences at other locations). The service is great and the staff are really nice and professional. Our server was awesome, his name was Erik - very pleasant young man and very attentive. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Had lunch at the bar. Lora the bartender/server was friendly and attentive. Lobster bisque bowl was tasty and hot but seemed a bit skimpy. Good place for lunch during Lent."}
{"text":"Went to Red Lobster just to try the lobster roll and I have to say, we have never been in such a hurry to leave. While our waitress was very nice and accommodating, we could barely hide the fact that we were extremely disappointed by the food. The lobster roll was an absolute joke. We knew it wouldn't be as great as actual seaside ones on the coast but we weren't expecting something so horrible. I wish that I had asked for something different.  The \"lobster bisque\" was also frankly the worst soup I have ever tasted. Our lobster pizza was small but bearable, and our fries were good. Thank goodness for the cheesy biscuits otherwise we would have cried. Needless to say, we're not sure whether we will be back anytime soon or not."}
{"text":"Awwwww, Cheddar Bay Biscuits!   Really, what more can I add to Cheddar Bay Biscuits?  Those things must be made with crack because you will be addicted after the first bite.  Yummy!  Ok, ok, now to the review!  Red Lobster is an A-OK restaurant in my book.  I don't visit it often, but when I do, I always enjoy my meal.  It isn't fancy, but it sure is tasty.  The prices are pretty reasonable for what you get.  They often have great specials, like the 4 course meal for $14.99.  And the best part, unlimited Cheddar Bay BiscuitsI   RL also has some great lunch specials for when you want something smaller and cheaper.  Most of the lunch specials are $7.99, which is pretty good for some seafood.   I always feel like I got a great deal when the bill arrives for lunch or dinner.    The menu is pretty big and quite diverse as well.  If you like shrimp, you are in luck because there always seems to be at least a dozen different types of shrimp.  They also have lots of other seafood options to suit everyone in your group.  Don't like seafood?  That's ok too, because they have steak, chicken, and beef options as well.  Everyone should be happy in your party.  If anything, everyone can just eat the unlimited Cheddar Bay Biscuits.  Have I mentioned how amazing those suckers are yet? Yum!  The food over all is ok.  The dishes are ok.  Nothing is really special or outstanding, but it gets the job done.  The super highlight of the menu is the chicken tortilla soup.  It is super duper yummy and I think my favorite thing at RL.  It is a chain restaurant, so at least you always know what to expect, no matter which location you are at.  The service here is usually pretty good.  They have a dud or 2 in the service department, but that is everywhere it seems.  I don't require much though, just keep the Cheddar Bay Biscuits coming and my soda filled and I am head over heels happy.    The interior is ok as well.  I know they want to be fancy, but it is still just an ok interior.  This location was recently remodeled though and is looking a lot fresher.  So, the moral of the story is that Red Lobster is ok.  And guess what??? I will be back for some more Cheddar Bay Biscuits!"}
{"text":"Awwwww, Cheddar Bay Biscuits!   Really, what more can I add to Cheddar Bay Biscuits?  Those things must be made with crack because you will be addicted after the first bite.  Yummy!  Ok, ok, now to the review!  Red Lobster is an A-OK restaurant in my book.  I don't visit it often, but when I do, I always enjoy my meal.  It isn't fancy, but it sure is tasty.

I would normally give Red Lobster a 3 star rating because it is a-ok in my book, but I have to add a couple of stars due to my most recent visit.  I was with my mom, mother in law, and daughter after a fun night out.  When we first arrived, my daughter ran to the lobster tank, which is what she always does.  She loves to look at them and tell me all about them.  It was slow when we walked in and the host noticed how much she was en trailed with the lobsters.  He offered to let her pet one, which we totally went for.  He pulled out a bad boy and let us pet him.  I had to go first because everyone else was scared.  It turns out the rest of the ladies I was with are scared of lobsters.  Oh well, at least I can scratch \"Pet a lobster\" off of my bucket list now.  Well during dinner, my 2 year daughter decided she didn't want to eat and just wanted to look at the lobsters.  We took turns taking her up there to stare at the lobsters.  On one of the trips, she decided she wanted a chip from one of the plates to take with her up there.  She was eating the chip and staring at lobsters when she started to choke on the chip.  She was turning red, then was having trouble breathing due to the chip in her throat.  The host and one of the grandma's was with her, and started to help her get the chip out.  She got it out all right.....By vomiting ALL over the place.  Yes, we were THOSE people.  Luckily it went all over the floor and Grandma (poor grandma) and not on other people or the lobsters.  The team at Red Lobster totally handled it, continued to help my kiddo, who was freaking out, got it all cleaned up, and gave us a ton of wet towels to get everyone cleaned up.  Several of the people even came by to check on my kiddo and our group to make sure we were all ok.  They totally went above and beyond what was needed for the incident.  I felt awful for the mess we had made, but they all kept telling me not to worry about it and they seemed to really mean it.  This was customer service at it's best!  Thanks again Red Lobster for all of the help you gave us and sorry for the mess!"}
{"text":"Took my twins for a birthday dinner or server Zoe was fantastic and the food was excellent. The seafood ultimate feast was amazing."}
{"text":"I honestly cannot say Yay or Nay - I know it's my mom's favorite place which is the reason we go at least once when she is in town visiting.   I do love their biscuit and cocktails, and the servers (staff) have always been very nice. The food somewhat depends on the day, the last time I went I try something new, as I always do. And I have to admit their lobster tacos were good as they had a little zing to it.  I appreciate the quantities delivered as you always have left overs to bring home and then you do not need to cook the next day."}
{"text":"Riddle me this, why would a guy who doesn't much care for most fish and has a shellfish allergy come to Red Lobster? Well, I like the cheddar bay biscuits, Ceasar salad and garlic mashed potatoes. I used to get the shrimp scampi before I developed this pescky allergy.  No, there is not much food here at Red Lobster for me to eat but I can usually find something aside from the items mentioned above. Today I went for lunch and got a create your own lunch of fried clams, chicken strips and mashed potatoes. Of course the cheddar bay biscuits are complimentary as is a salad.   I went with Italian dressing on a regular side salad this time rather than my regular Ceasar. I've got to say, it was damn good. Like a raspberry vinegrette. The biscuits were amazing today too. Crispy on the outside. Soft and fluffy on the inside. Buttery. Garlicy. Cheesey. Delicious. The clams were good but its hard to mess them up. They are served with tartar sauce but I asked for cocktail sauce. I used both. I love a good cocktail sauce and it is my go to for fried clams but the tartar sauce was great too. Lightly sweet. I would love it on a fish sandwich. The chicken fingers were average. I realize this is Red Lobster and not Raising Caine's so I'll give them a pass. The honey mustard they serve with it was good but like the clams, its hard to mess up. And finally on to the the potatoes. I usually love the potatoes from here. Today, though, they were dense, dry and heavy. I like that they were left a little lumpy but they could have been creamier.   I don't come to Red Lobster very often given my limited options. But I do stop in here and there. Its a little pricy when you consider what I get is pretty well average. $3.50 for an iced tea seems a lot. And almost $7 for a piece of cheese cake had me running to BK for dessert. But the service was good, fast and friendly."}
{"text":"Surprisingly had a good experience at this Red Lobster today. The last couple of times I have been to a Red Lobster have been disappointing to say the least but this experience was much better. I feel as though this location has it together, from customer service to food quality, they get it.  My sister and I arrived around 5:30 this evening. We were seated right away and needed a high chair as we had my baby niece with us as well. We were seated at a very nice table in the back and we were kindly given a high chair with no problem. Our waiter, while he seemed new and a bit nervous was very nice and he was very prompt with service. My sister and I both ended up ordering the same thing off of the crabfest menu which was a sirloin topped with lump crab meat and green beans. We both ordered our steaks medium rare. They came out perfectly cooked, juicy, and the crab gave them a great amount of flavor.  Overall our visit today was very good. Service was good, food was very good, I was slightly shocked at how impressed I was with this Red Lobster. I had pretty much given up on them but we were both in the mood for seafood and there are not a lot of options in Mesa but I was pleasantly surprised tonight. Kudos Red Lobster, you might have won back a skeptic..."}
{"text":"I used to really like Red Lobster. After many sub par experiences at different locations over the last couple of years I have come to the conclusion that Red Lobster is going downhill fast. Today I met my sister here for lunch around 1:30pm. We were seated right away but it took our waiter about 15 minutes to approach the table. We eventually got our drinks after asking twice.   I looked over the lunch menu and they definitely had some new items since the last time I had dined with Red Lobster about six months ago. The lobster grilled cheese and shrimp salad sandwich were among the odd choices on the lunch menu. I went with the staple grilled shrimp house salad with a cup of clam chowder soup, my sister had fried shrimp and scallops. The food took at least 30 minutes to be served which I thought was quite ridiculous for a lunch service especially for some salad, soup and fried food. My clam chowder was mediocre at best, tasted like it came out of a can for sure and the grilled shrimp in my salad still tasted half frozen. My sister did enjoy her fried shrimp, maybe fried is the way to go at Red Lobster because clearly fresh is not the top priority here.  Overall bad. Service was just mediocre. Food was bad. I will not be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Noel was the waiter. He is awesome.!ordered a martini came in a mason jar and it was perfect. Food was amazing. Noel came and cleaned my shrimp. They have been open a year and been there at least 6 times. Good every time."}
{"text":"Went Sunday night. In town for business.  Great service food hot. Mostly empty and still great food and service?  Yep... that's pretty special."}
{"text":"Tina is an excellent Server! Hostesses  was good. Manager passed over our table 3 times and did not ask my husband and I anything about services. Need new manager. Las Vegas"}
{"text":"Not the red lobster I grew up on.   When I was a kid, and it was fancy food time, we went to red lobster. When something great happened and it was time to celebrate, we went to red lobster. We dressed up for red lobster.  We were on our best behavior for red lobster. Red lobster was the real deal.   When you walked in to red lobster (after a red lobster person held the door open for you), it felt like you had just teleported to a wharf. Sometimes it felt like you were still on a fishing boat. You could almost feel the floor move. The lobsters in the tank looked alive.  And when you left there were mints. Lots of mints.  Now red lobster sucks.  Red lobster is in a strip mall. No red lobster people hold the door open for you. All the lobsters look dead. Like turds. Dead turds. It doesn't feel like a wharf anymore. It feels like a basement. The soap in the bathroom smells like a mixture of bleach and fabuloso. There's no mints.  Not everything was bad though. Our waitress was cute, despite that she had a bandaid on her face (presumably to cover a piercing or tattoo, which both look better than people with bandaids on their faces (except Nelly)). When we told them how pumped we were to really eat all the shrimp we could eat, they were very accommodating and excited for us. The biscuits are still good.  There's just none of the red lobster feels. The only thing to celebrate was eating 157 shrimps.  P.S. I forgot, but THERE'S NO FUCKING CROUTONS IN THE SALAD ANYMORE?!?! What the fuck good is a salad without croutons?"}
{"text":"Horrible, management and hostesses should be fired.  They seem to have a problem with their dishwasher tonight but instead of being honest with their customers instead they only told us \"there's an issue\" causing our wait time and others to be 2hrs or more. Around 10 parties ended up throwing their beepers back at them and walking out. Others came in and was told the wait time would be 3hrs or more so they left out mad. Several asked to speak to management but he never came out to speak to anyone. Once they finally started sitting people and taking orders, the management never came around to apologize to anyone or even check to see how food was. Very unprofessional, rude."}
{"text":"Service was really slow. I mean really slow. It took over an hour to get the food and then couldn't find the waitress to pay. A total of 1:45 minutes sitting i would give it a 1 star but the food is ok."}
{"text":"Great place endless shrimp on the menu. Full to the rim. Kids loved it but they need to learn to me more shrimp. Pss"}
{"text":"I go right to the bar to have dinner. 9 times out of 10 there is no wait. Service is nice and fast.   I had on this visit:  Cheese bay biscuits: Fresh and warm, taste as normal was very good.  Ceasar salad: greens were nice and crisp, dressing was not overbearing, but was very tasty.   Endless shrimp promo: NEW! NASHVILLE HOT SHRIMP: not very hot, but has a sticky sweet glaze NEW! MEDITERRANEAN SHRIMP: served over a bed of rice, had a good blend of herbs, tomato and green onions. GARLIC SHRIMP SCAMPI: very good flavor, u can definitely taste the garlic HAND-BREADED SHRIMP: breading was fresh and crisp SHRIMP LINGUINI ALFREDO: linguini was cooked just right, shrimp was also very good  Mussels: just the perfect blend of white wine, roasted garlic, roasted tomatoes and green onions very tasty.   Server was excellent, Thank you"}

{"text":"Yes I am writing a review about Red Lobster, don't judge me!! You all know you love those little cheddar biscuits more then life itself!   Seriously, Those biscuits, good lord!   Hubs and I went here last night, his picking. He loves him some Ultimate Feast. I usually stick to the coconut shrimp.   Our waitress was awesome, the place was packed to the gills but we never really had to wait for refills. She did forget to put in for the beer hubs ordered, but he lived (YAY)!   The food comes out hot and fast.   We also got an appetizer, did the \"pick two\" the mozzarella sticks were surprisingly good and the calamari wasn't just fried calamari but it came with fried broccoli and red peppers as well, super tasty!"}
{"text":"We just had dinner at the Red Lobster in Chandler Arizona and our waitress was Theresa.Right away she made it known that there was some confusion with who was supposed to be waiting on our table.Honestly we did not even think it had bin a long time and we were still deciding what to eat anyway.She went out of her way regardless to make sure to make up for this when again we did'nt see it as a big deal.My wife and i had both been in the restaurant industry before and both waited on tables and understand how things like this sometimes just happen. Again we did not see it as a big deal anyway. I have always been a fan of Red Lobster anyway but today it was all about the exceptional service we received.I made sure to compliment Theresa's performance to the manager on staff as I am doing now here.Thank you Theresa, on this night you are greatly appreciated.

{"text":"Wow! Came in for the $15 dollar special and got about $50 worth of food. Our waitress ( Nicole) was great!"}
{"text":"This will be the LAST time I ever visit this location . our party arrived at separate times, the first 2 getting seated before 8PM and ordering about 10 minutes after ... right after they ordered, I walked in and sat down . waited about 10 minutes before the waitress came around with salads and biscuits and another 10 minutes before she finally came back to take my order. After my family had gotten their main dishes and 2 refills on their endless shrimp courses, I still hadn't gotten my food . After flagging the waitress down, she comes back out and says that I hadn't gotten any food yet because they were out of mashed potatoes . She asks me what i would like instead and goes back to the kitchen . I wait at least another 10 minutes ... it's after 9 PM and i still don't have my food yet . When they finally bring my food out, my side that i just ordered is cold . I don't say anything, I eat it . I order a refill on my shrimp and keep it pushing . I'm waiting ... waiting ... still no refill . when the waitress brings my pasta out ... THERE'S A HAIR IN IT! not like resting on top of the food but embedded in the damn alfredo sauce! ... I'm irritated . I get up to go to the restroom and my mother tells them that there is a hair in my food . The Manager then comes out and says that everyone has on a hair net on so he doesn't know how that happened but they'll bring me another one . They bring me another plate of pasta and I still hadn't gotten the other refill that I ordered . So after all of this, I ask to talk to the manager . He comes out and asks me all these questions like 'oh so you said you got here after them' ... yes, yes i did . that doesn't change the fact that i waited 40 minutes from the time I ordered to get my food . He just stares blankly at me while I'm trying to tell him about my experience . I've worked in customer service for years, I know he's not actively listening . Not reiterating any of my concerns, not making sure he that he understands my complaints, not asking me any questions to let me know that he's actually listening . So this pisses me off even more but i don't raise my voice or anything . I just wait for him to respond . He says \"I'll discount the meal\" and walks away ..... YOU CLEARLY DO NOT CARE ABOUT THE TERRIBLE SERVICE IN YOUR ESTABLISHMENT OR HAVE THE CUSTOMER SERVICE SKILLS NECESSARY TO HANDLE THESE TYPES OF ISSUES IN YOUR RESTAURANT . I didn't ask for a discount, I asked to talk to you about my experience and you couldn't even listen to that . It's 950pm ... they close in 10 minutes and at this point I'm over it . I continue to wait for my food just because I've already spent almost 2 hours here so why not . When it finally arrives, I just ask to take it to go and she says No, because they don't allow you to take Endless Shrimp to go . In a normal situation, I could totally understand that . But after wait for an hour to get it AND there's a hair in it and you have to remake it again, that is absolutely ridiculous. I have my 2 year old son with me (who is behaving extremely well ... not crying, making a mess, not doing anything normal 2 year olds do) but It's after 10PM now ... the least you could do is let me take my food to go after this disaster of an experience . This was one of the WORST restaurant experiences I have ever had . If I could give 0 stars, I would . With that being said, I will NEVER return to Red Lobster again ."}
{"text":"I love Red Lobster's endless shrimp and delicious biscuits however, I'm sitting here writing this review at my table because I've been here for an hour and a half so far and have yet to get my food! Drink refills are impossible to obtain because our server can't figure it out. In fact, he disappears for 20 minutes at a time without resurfacing from behind the kitchen doors. I couldn't even leave if I wanted to because I can't get my check! I'll update my review with food reviews if our food ever arrives..."}
{"text":"Set down this evening at red lobster to have a lovely dinner with my fiancé, unfortunately after we placed her meal order the meal was delivered to the table behind us we noticed it patiently waited another 15 minutes for someone to come and a acknowledge that they gave her food to the table behind us. Not even a single offer of let me comp your drinks let me give you a gift card we simply got told \"do you understand what happened\" Yep we understand what happened we got up and walked out absolutely worst dining experience of ever had a red lobster."}
{"text":"Red Lobster is Red Lobster, but this location has the best customer service in the valley. Josh was very attentive. We tried some of the new menu items, and didn't care for one of them. Josh asked us how we liked them, gave the feedback to the manager, who kindly offered to bring us something different. You don't often see that at a chain restaurant."}
{"text":"Food is good and especially the service is pretty awesome. The guy who call Lawrence is so kind and honest and we appreciate. Be sure we satisfied with the service and will back again. Thousands liked for him."}
{"text":"Always a fan of Walt's Favorite Fried Shrimp and the cheddar biscuits!  Will say that this particular location was cleaner than most of the Red Lobster's I have been to.  The food came out quickly and was piping hot and our server, Rico was attentive and friendly.  No complaints here."}
{"text":"We chose to go to Red Lobster because we wanted lobster. I guess we should be a bit pickier next time. I ordered rock and Maine lobster tails. While the maine lobster was delicious, the rock lobster was tough and veiny. The service was excellent though."}
{"text":"I just had the misfortune of eating there for the first time ever. My mom got a water, it came 20 min late. I got a cesar salad, it came in my lap... Luckily it had like 1% dressing so it didn't stain my jeans. No manager came over to talk to us and apologize, no discount or anything was offered, and the server left the half salad on my table still... My lobster didn't seem very fresh either, as it took me breaking the tail to be able to remove it from the shell, it did not come out through conventional means.   Overall: if they had lobster at Denny's, I'd rather eat it there."}
{"text":"the manager during lunch was extremely rude to us, harassed us about my grandmother's  service dog, even though we showed the dogs credentials. 10 minutes later after the verbal assault she finally seated my disabled grandmother. she nor  I will  never go back again . our server was their saving grace and the only reason we stayed."}
{"text":"We love red lobster it is always great and everyone is super friendly it is just always a treat to go here :)))."}
{"text":"We are very disappointed in how rude the manager handled a situation.  We were waiting for a table and it happened to be national prohibition anniversary and I seen a lady sitting alone drinking a margarita I asked her politely of there was a way I could take a picture of just her hand and her drink and told her the story I was doing and she said no I don't feel comfortable I said not a problem then went back to waiting for our table.  Once we finally were escorted to our seat many of minutes later the manager as we we were seated started yelling at me in front of all the customers were we were seated saying that the customer was upset and to not ask any one else.  It was already embarrassing enough for me to have asked the lady in the first place. Then the table next to us asked us what was that all about?  If she just would have said it quieter or not allowed for everyone to hear but my husband was so embarrassed we left immediately. :(.  The server seemed so nice and said please don't go.  I probably was in the wrong to have asked but she could have said something before we were seated or not so loud for everyone to hear.  :("}
{"text":"I am not a foodie or expert but i will share my opinion.  The RL of years ago was a much better choice because it offered fried fish as well.  Today's versions (they convinced a bunch of sheep that broiled or boiled is better for you) is very, very bland.  Probably the cheapest prices on lobster and crab but if you don't eat that and you are looking for a great fried fish dinner (like fresh perch) well good luck.  Also when they offered only rice or bland potato for sides I was concerned and frankly the selections are just too blah...bring back the great fish fries, yes oil costs and can be messy but the food tastes better."}
{"text":"I have been to this location multiple times, actually i probably come a few times a month with my family. The food is good, service is great, atmosphere is nice, but of course this place is not the Salt Cellar and the quality of food is just alright. I always get the Ultimate Feast which gives you a variety of everything and fills me up!"}
{"text":"Came here w friend, salad w salmon took 45 min.  Friends meal came out first with visible heat lamp damage.  Mgr replaced friends meal, much better.  We also watched a bus boy wipe table near us with used napkins and no cleaning spray - someone sat down shortly after.  We were given a small discount for our trouble.  Never coming back."}
{"text":"After recently coming twice to Red Lobster, I haven't been in about 10 years, but I missed going so much, iv recently started going again, of course when my wallet allows me to.   Everytime I come here, all the waiters/ waitresses are so friendly, and the food is really good. I'm not into lobster or seafood, but I usually get the salmon, haddock, or shrimp...the shrimp bruschetta is to die for. I love shrimp so much that I always get a garlic grilled shrimp skewer on the side just for kicks. The fish is always so flavourful and I love their tarter sauce, good sauce! And the warm, soft yet crispy biscuits...yumm!   The food is abit on the pricey side, but I think it's worth it!   I'm counting down the days till I come again, hopefully sometime soon!"}
{"text":"I've been going to this Red Lobster my whole life and I've always been happy with my food.  My husband and I went last night for the Endless Shrimp and our waiter was Joshua. He was great! Very personable and we actually chatted quite a bit (it was late, near closing) but he wasn't awkward or overbearing like some waiters can be when they try to start up random conversations with customers. He helped us get the MOST for our money with the Endless shrimp special and we ended up going home with enough leftovers for us to both have lunch the next day.  My only complaint (which was N/A this time because I didn't order alcohol) is that whenever I've ordered an alcoholic drink at any Red Lobster it has been pretty light on the alcohol. When I pay a premium for a drink I expect to get my money's worth of alcohol in it! :)  Otherwise this place is clean, staff is friendly, and prices are fair."}
{"text":"Went out to dinner with my husband and the waiter David was very generous and passion about his job. The first impression was marvelous and this was my first time visiting. They put us in nice seats without a hisitation and I thank them for that. My husband and I had a good time, service was great and plan to go back."}
{"text":"Are there NEW owners of the Red Lobster? Think so because the \"BEST\" Fish & Chips in Mesa and the Phoenix metropolitan area is now \"HORRIBLE\". They took a wonderful full fillet of a good fish with a light crisp batter to 3 or 4 grease soaked processed fish pieces that can't be separated from the pancake batter. Guess a bean counter found a way to make another dime on Fish & Chips. Not from us every again."}
{"text":"Came in at dinner time and it was quite busy. After we were seated, a server came up and took the check off of the table left by the previous customer and stated that she would be right back. She then proceeded to pass our table without saying a word at least 5 times in the next 10 to 15 minutes. Finally another server, Alyssa, noticed we were sitting there and offered to get us something to drink while waiting for our server. When she returned with our Iced Teas, she stated that she was also ignored by our server when she mentioned us to her. Alyssa stated that she would be our server and the night improved from there. Red Lobster fare is Red Lobster fare, the service is what tips the event toward the favorable. This visit, between being ignored by our original server and not a sight of the manager makes us wonder if another visit would be worthwhile."}
{"text":"We stopped here for dinner one night coming home from the Wisconsin Dells. There was no wait. We were seated immediately. We had 3 adults and 1 child in our party. The server was amazing. I think she was one of the best servers we have ever had in a restaurant. We all had different drinks which were kept full. Our cheddar biscuit basket was kept full. Everyone knows Red Lobster has the best cheddar biscuits. We all ordered different entrees. They were all brought out hot and were delicious. The manager stopped by to check on us. It was overall the best Red Lobster experience we have ever had."}
{"text":"The best thing about this evening was the bread.  I have been going to Red Lobster since I was 5.  This meal was inedible.  My mother actually got sick at the table after eating the Bar Harbour Bake.  Service was very slow.  Food was under cooked.  My husband had the Admiral's Feast.  Could not eat it. I had the Ultimate Feast and my lobster was not cooked properly.  Mom worked in seafood restaurants for 20 yrs.  Said the lobster was under cooked and didn't taste right.  No discounts off the meal.  The manager requested my mothers name and phone number for \"legal\" reasons.  PLEASE call her tomorrow.  I'm sure the 81 year old would LOVE to tell you what she thinks of your food."}
{"text":"Most of the food was decent but it tends to be very expensive. The clam chowder was not; it tasted very bland, almost like cheap canned soup.  Overall, the service was very poor. We were seated quickly. The appetizer arrived after the meal. They did comp it because of its lateness. Interestingly, the server ordered 2 appetizers for a table of 2, and it was quite large. We sent the 2nd one back. The soup arrived after the dinner. My drink was empty for probably 15 mins before a refill was provided. I asked for a substitite for the potato, for which they agreed. It never arrived.  At the conclusion of the meal, the server became a little too casual. While commenting on the weather, she stated that it was to be cold that night, followed by \"we fu..ed.\" She repeated it.   It was clare that the server was very inexperienced but really? I will not return to this chain."}
{"text":"Went there for my hubby's birthday and we both ordered the four course meal: Clan chowder (tasted like the can ones) Caesar salad (my hubby liked it a lot)  I got the Cajun chicken linguine (a little to cheesy and salty) Hubby got the grilled shrimp and lobster poutine (he was disappointed with the portion size compared to my main course.  Double chocolate brownie & cheesecake (had to pack it to go cause we're really full).   (Unlimited biscuits) really good and filling   Plus escargot (pretty good especially with garlic bread.   Only problem with the food is that everything was super salty! Sodium overload!   Peach lemonade - wished they out more ice to make it colder but Overall it was pretty good.   The main entrance smelled really bad (we wanted to leave but ended up waiting in line to be seated cause we wanted to try red lobster)."}
{"text":"This Red Lobster was good. If you consider this is a chain restaurant, you'll get good, consistent, family dining that provides great value. So on that scale, this restaurant exceeds expectations, though you'll not get a fine dining experience. My crab cake salmon combo was well presented and cooked just right. A fine dining restaurant would have scaled the salmon skin and cooked it so it was crunchy, but this met my expectations. The crab cakes had an appropriate ratio of crab-to-cake and read quite delicious. The shrimp topping cooked perfectly. All told, this was a great meal for the price and I recommend this place as a good value."}
{"text":"We will not be back to this location. Customer service was not good at all. Took 25 minutes to get salads. Had no napkins and utensils. Had to ask for them twice. Sold out of salmon. Come out with all the dishes and each one had a side missing! No refills on drinks whatsoever! Horrible experience!!!!!"}
{"text":"Nothing special or over the top. Food was good and service was also. Great place for some seafood and always enjoy their crab legs."}
{"text":"Horrible! We walked into the restaurant at 4:30 on a Monday night. The place was dead however we were told it would be a 20 to 25 minute wait.  After 20 minutes we where seated the hostess was telling me along the way to our table that they only had a few tables for a party of 5, 2 adults and 3 kids under 7. The server came over got our drink order and then let us know that they where out of split king crab, salmon, and birdie crab. During crab fest really?????? I added a jumbo crab cake for 6.99, this thing was no bigger than a silver dollar and tasted like fish. My husband added mini shrimp to his salad and it came out with these jumbo shrimp. The server said sorry we don't have little shrimp any more. They where gross. My husband's shrimp where cold. We will never be back to any red lobster. It was horrible."}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite chain restaurants. Is it the cheddar bay biscuits? Is it the Endless Shrimp promotion for $16.99 each, from August to November? Is it the service? It could be a combination of all these things. We've been to this location the most compared to the others (Decatur & Oahu) over the years. This one usually has a wait on the weekends- it seems to be the most popular out of the three locations here. Sometimes passing by, I see people outside sitting on the benches. And the parking lot is usually pretty filled.   I've had some of the other dishes here and yes, portions are not that great (for seafood). So, we come mainly for the Endless Shrimp event. It is not a buffet. The server brings you the order when you get the urge for a new dish (kinda like the Sizzler, with the all you can eat shrimp). Note: the shrimp linguine alfredo takes a while to cook, so order that first. You can choose from the following: shrimp scampi, coconut bites (used to be divine when they used Captain Morgan's rum, a few years back), popcorn shrimp, shrimp on skewers, and the linguine alfredo (the best out of all of these choice). The server starts us off with the famous warm cheddar chive biscuits. I try to have just one because I don't want to fill up too fast. The server asks you for your two choices (and then go from there). It's easy to get full with this event that we love so much. Everything is delicious. Ok, the shrimp is not going to be huge, at this price. But this is still a good value overall. The service: the hosts are always welcoming, the servers here are all very good and attentive (refilling glasses and asking if we'd like to place another order for more shrimp). If you are still hungry, try the warm chocolate chip lava cookie- it's really yummy. Oh, I almost forgot to mention that when you walk in, you feel like you have been transported to New England. It's got a fun nautical theme. Booths & table seating available.   If you join the e-mail club, you can print off dated coupons (usually expire in a month). The lunches start off at $6.99 per person. I've had the soup combos, served in a sourdough bowl- it's pretty good."}
{"text":"Had dinner with my wife here...the service from Ms. Lorraine was outstanding....keep up the good work....food was fresh hot and prompt....thanks RL"}
{"text":"Had dinner here today and Akari was our server...excellent hospitality skills ...food was hot and fresh...thanks again see u next time..."}
{"text":"love their special biscuit, soft and delicious. the seafood is fresh and nice. endless shrimp is a great choice."}
{"text":"I used to enjoy Red Lobster.  Based on other reviews I see that I am not the only one that has had a bad experience. So let's break this down...  Our service was actually really great. Our waitress spaced out out app, salads and dinner very nicely. The wine was 300% of the cost in the grocery so that was a little irksome lol. But the app we got the calamari and it was overlooked and there was more fried broccoli than calamari. The fried broccoli was interesting, little over cooked but not terrible I guess. Our salads were average, nothing bad and nothing great. Now for our entrees. I got the lobster lovers dream, which by the is $30, and lobster was so overlooked it could have been mistaken for a tire. It was inedible. My husbands crab legs were a little overlooked as well but definitely not as bad as my lobster.   Now I said that our waitress was good, and she was. She brought the manager over and they offered to replace with another lobster, which we declined bc we have a rule of never sending back food and then eating what comes out because we may be a little paranoid lol. So the manager took $10 off our bill. We didn't think that was sufficient but we said thank you, left our waitress 20% of our original bill, and left. I am not sure if we will ever be back which is unfortunate bc my husband and I both love seafood. We may in the far future give then another shot and hopefully they redeem themselves."}
{"text":"If your steamer is turned off because it's 1 hour from closing time, please inform us and we won't order. Don't nuke the crab legs. Leg meat was a string. I can't even find words to describe the misery of these crab legs. I sent it back and 10 minutes later, I got the same legs. Well, I'm sure it is not the same legs, but it was dried out as same way. 10 days old crab legs. Nothing else to say."}
{"text":"Can I please rave about the impeccable service here? I am often disappointed with the terrible service at other restaurants. But I'm never disappointed with the service here at Red Lobster.   The servers here are trained to provide good customer service and tend to our needs, making the experience even more amazing. Moving onto the food, accompanied with the complimentary cheddar biscuits. Am I the only one that is addicted to these? I limit myself to maximum of 3 but really it is good!   I ordered the following:  lobster artichoke and seafood dip  stuffed sole w/ mashed potatoes (lunch) Maple glazed chicken  Triple berry sangria  Strawberry daiquiri   The food arrived in a timely manner and the food arrived hot. The dip was creamy and packed with flavour. The stuffed sole was fresh and it's still one of my favourites at Red Lobster. The drinks were perfect and arrived prior to the food. After receiving the food/drinks we were approached to make sure all was good and again can I say amazing service!   Come here! You won't be disappointed, at least not with the service. The wait can take awhile since they don't take reservations, it's first come first serve."}
{"text":"CrabFest, WOW!!!  This was the best crab leg experience I ever ate. The Bairdi crab was sweet and delicious and my server Vannesa was AWESOME! !!! She was friendly and made the crab recommendation and service was out of this world."}
{"text":"The food here is semi-average if you plan on going here for a date. Your date will not really be impressed. The food will not come out looking like the picture. It almost looks rushed but it does taste good no doubt about that. I would not recommend the crab legs FYI it may make you feel sick."}
{"text":"I had my parents over for the weekend and my parents are like most and they are fairly weird. This time the weird discussion revolves around my father and his love of eating establishments in particular  Red Lobster.  I must admit I was biased and am one of those persons that considers Red Lobster the McDonalds of seafood so this would typically not be a place I would visit to eat.   Surprisingly this visit was very good. I have a few horror stories of other Red Lobster's but this one end with everyone smiling and cheering. We drove to this restaurant in separate vehicles and the first thing I noticed is how far the handicap parking spaces are from the entrance. My parents park in those spaces and it was a hike for them to make it to the front door. I guess they want handicapped parking folks to get the most exercise  to build up for the meal. I am not sure of the planning or thoughts they have on parking. I am just thankful it was a beautiful day.   Entering the restaurant and all the employees were kind and smiling. They sat us all within about 15 minutes. My father ordered his usual admiral feast, I had a lobster pizza (watching calories). Wife had a pasta dish, my mother had the stuffed founder and my kids had fries.   It was all delicious! Cooked to perfection and served timely. My father even went out of his way to say this was they best one he has been to in a long time.     The bill was $101 and that's not bad for 6 people eating.   I recommend this location."}
{"text":"ENDLESS SHRIMP!!   So my son has been asking to go to Red Lobster for a while and I finally decided to take him. I noticed they had endless shrimp for 15.99$ so off we went.   We arrived and parked and were greeted by a very nice lady, taken back to our seats and on came our server. She took our drink order and came back and asked us what we'd like. I asked if my son and I could share the endless shrimp bc hes young and will end up eating off my plate anyway, and she said sure she didnt see a problem with it. SCORE!   Our first dish was bite sized coconut shrimp and breaded shrimp... OMFG YUM!! The breading on both was PERFECT! Not overly breaded but not skimpy. The coconut shrimp came with the yummy pineapple sauce, which was totally delectable! The breaded came with the standard ketchup, and that other red stuff (yucky!) and french fries which were DELIGHTFUL!  This first plate was seriously the bees knees!   Next we got shrimp alfredo and sweet and spicy shrimp. OMFG! Yet another perfect plate!! The alfredo was not overly oily and had a lot of bite sized shrimp! The sweet and spicy shrimp was AMAZING! The perfect blend of sweet and spicy! My son ate the entire skewer of this grilled delicacy! It is served along some rice pilaf which was also freakin delish!  After this yummy explosion we got the Parmesan crusted scampi and another order of the sweet and spicy. Normally scampi is too buttery for me but hot damn this was ON IT! I took one bite and the buttery with just a hint of crunchy from the parm was absolutely PERFECT! I swear I heard cherubs! I never wanted this love affair I was having with the shrimp to end! I felt like I was taking advantage of Red Lobster because I got unlimited yummies! AND THE CHEDDAR BAY BISCUITS! Fresh and warm and just soooo DELICIOUS! I swear they are lucky I could only eat soo much, the table behind us trumped me they ordered like 13 plates! I was like WOW!!  Marquitta was my server and she was a delight!! Never rushed us or anything!! Seriously the nicest server I had in a WHILE!!  I would def recommend this RL, they even let us per 2 Lobsters!! My son was sooooo happy about this! AWESOME! The place itself is clean and very tidy, I had no complaints! Even the bathroom was super clean!! GREAT JOB!  Go here now before endless shrimp is over! Ill probably go for dinner tonight!!"}
{"text":"Wife really has been craving this place. I Think all the commercials won her over. It's what you'd expect for a chain. Surprisingly the salmon was moist. Jumbo shrimp were dry like they sat out after being cooked. Broccoli was over cooked. Unlimited biscuits are a bonus."}
{"text":"I see why this restaurant is rated so poorly. The clientele, for some reason, really made for a LOUD dining experience. We were seated next to a booth with a happy baby who was being encouraged to squeal loudly in delight while her parent played with her. I love a happy baby, but not one who is being encouraged to be LOUD in a restaurant while others are trying to enjoy dinner with family members. It took awhile after asking, but we were able to be moved away to another table mid-meal. The meal itself was meh; the lobster seemed a little overdone and the crab not as tasty as it should have been. Our waitress was hit or miss and we waited awhile for the bill. Would not visit again."}
{"text":"Its Red Lobster, not fine dining so I am going to be fair on this review and give it 3 stars. Lets be honest - you get what you pay for. I went in yesterday with Hubby and both kids for lunch. They have some good promos running right now so that was a plus. Our server was interesting, lol. He was quite talkative and literally gave his his agenda each time he came to the table. For example we ordered our drinks and before leaving the table he told us - \" I am going to put the order in, make your iced tea, grab some sugar, stop by the bar and pick up the chocolate milk for the kids and be right back.\" I didn't mind the play by play but it almost seemed as if he was reminding himself more than us what needed to be done.   OK so onto the important stuff. The kids meals are huge!! For $6 my son got a dinner salad (adult sized) a chocolate milk (free refills) 4 large chicken tenders and an order of fries. Not a bad deal at all! It would have been more than enough to feed both the kids and I would have only ordered 1 had I known. I ordered the a soup and salad lunch special and the hubby ordered shrimp scampi/chicken tender lunch combo. Overall the food tasted good and came out in a reasonable amount of time.   Now for the reason they got 3 stars - The kids drinks never made it to the table. we eventually flagged down another employee and had them bring them out. My husband didn't like his lemonade (it is the lite version with artificial sweetener) so he ordered a replacement drink. The server never brought it out but the manager must have seen it waiting at the bar to be delivered and eventually did bring it to our table. I wanted Tabasco for my soup and after asking for it started eating my salad waiting for it to arrive. About 10 minutes later, after my soup had chilled to luke warm, the manager came back to our table and apologized saying they couldn't find any... no hot sauce, really?  As mentioned, you get what you pay for. It was still an enjoyable experience and I would go back."}
{"text":"I came to Red Lobster with my Red Lobster loving parents for my birthday and I am oddly shocked to say that the food was much better than I remembered from past experiences. Service was super friendly, drinks were still (my mom may have left feeling a little too good haha) and food was better than my expectations.  I would visit this location again!"}
{"text":"I had the shrimp and asparagus it was great but I feel four stars is appropriate being I like a deal with my meal and wanted to entrees lol I'm spolied but I'll be back cause the food and service is great"}
{"text":"If you have a choice, just drive here or Concord.  This place isn't the best but it's better than Pineville in terms of service and food options seem to run out moreso than other locations.   ALSO, your giftcard must say Red Lobster on it to use it here since August 2017 and not just like the other places in the Darden portfolio or under the umbrella.   The newest host is great with handling service and juggling customers."}
{"text":"They're trying but working under new management with a \"strained budget\" per the GM.   I won't go into details about my latest experience but at this point, I wish them well. I hope it goes far in terms of improvements.   I hope cleaniness improves.  I hope server training takes place more often.  I hope kitchen communication and expo'ing takes some training seminars and improve vastly over my latest visit. So,  this way ....when things that are on NATIONAL PROMO then they'll have items in stock.    Moreover they'll recall what the pictures look like when plating then actually plate the entree with all the items at once. And, maybe they'll bring the servers in on that training also teaching mindfulness or alertness but I honestly ain't trying to be bratty about my visit as I've had plenty but these are genuine tips for improvement to avoid the most basic mess ups like not plating the entire entree, not having things in stock, not communicating with each other so the customer doesn't have to bring it up 14 minutes later \"Hey, will I receive my lobster tail and scallops?\"   Thanks to the GM for the comp but I'd rather pay full price and get what I'm supposed to receive versus missing out on something.   Also, watch your server as ours (on this last visit) put his thumb in the salad as he picked it up to place it on the table. Yep~ we started rough while he sniffed his nose all night. Le sigh."}
{"text":"Bleh.  Brought a friend here for her birthday dinner (a Thursday evening for reference), as she requested it.  After eating there, I'm not sure why she did...  I'll start with the good:  THE SERVICE was really good!  Oscar was our server and he did an awesome job.  Checked in frequently, and was very friendly and helpful.  Took a while to get our bill and pay, but these things happen so no big deal.  The FOOD on the other hand, left a lot to be desired.  We both had the Ultimate Feast.  It's a heaping plate of shrimps/lobster tail/crab legs.  The garlic shrimp was fantastic and the the Walt's Fave shrimp was just ok.  That's where the good ends...  The Lobster and snow crab legs were COLD.  I'm not talking like I left them sitting there from the beginning of my meal for a while.  I really should have said something, but my friend didn't seem to mind it (and it was her choice) so I didn't.  But Sweet Jebus, that shouldn't come out cold!  Also, my crab legs were about half of what my friend had... what the *  Drink wise it was average.  My friend had a mudslide which she liked and I had an old fashioned which was alright.  For a chain restaurant, I feel like consistency is obviously the key to their success.  Cold food shouldn't leave the kitchen!  Very doubtful I'll go back."}
{"text":"Well, me and Red Lobster go way back to childhood. Not this location but different ones around town. Then we stopped going for lots of reasons. Well, we passed by this location few days ago and my husband loves seafood so we checked it out.   Upon arrival, the server sat us right down and gave us the specials. Then came back promptly to check up on us despite it being super busy on a week night. There's an excellent selection of cocktails here. Nothing high end but if you love cocktails, there menu is extensive and I was just thinking, this place would be perfect for a girls night out dinner!!! The drinks were ordered and came out probably less than 5 minutes later. Honestly the service here is so good and friendly.   The menu is also extensive. Seriously.... hard to choose................. but my husband ended up getting the seafood feast and I got the seafood bake with linguine. His was $30, mine as $29 and i was expecting average tasting seafood but my meal was so goood! The bake comes with one lobster tail split into two, 5 pcs of tender succulent scallops, lots of shrimp, and some mussles in the shell. The portion was large and I had a nice lunch the next day as well. It's not high end by any means but it's better than average home cooking and definitely a nice treat for someone who likes seafood.   Obviously no stomach left for dessert but they look good on the menu :)"}
{"text":"Good place, i like the ambience. Service is pretty good. 2nd time coming here so far so good, not a real fan of red lobster though but its not that bad. Food comes fairly quik. Would i come bak? Sure. My other half loves this place and my son loves the mac n cheese.."}
{"text":"It's great service and food for the price. They really do seem to take pride for a chain restaurant. I have never had a bad experience at a Red Lobster and this one is no different.  Quality and value for money"}
{"text":"Today was my first visit ever to Red Lobster. My fiance and me shared the lobster artichoke dip as an appetizer and both had Cesar salad and the Ultimate Feast with fried shrimp, cooked garlic shrimp, snow crab legs, lobster tail, rice pilaf, mashed potatoes and some dipping sauces/lemon butter. All in all, I really enjoyed it. The snow crab legs were my favorite, so sweet and delicious, and the butter lemon dip went perfectly with them. The rest also was good quality, no fishy smell or funky taste at all. Service was good too, attentive but not bothering you every few minutes. The place is clean and tidy. I take off a star because most dishes were a tad too salty for me, and it was pretty cold in there, we kept our jackets on the whole time."}
{"text":"I always have fun here good time and the new waitress Heather was very sweet tip her BIG! P.s good food"}
{"text":"Good place to go after a long day shopping at the mall.. O they do have a great happy hour too"}
{"text":"This chain of Red Lobster is VERY unprofessional. I needed to make a reservation for my beautiful girl friend on valentines day. After calling Feburary 13th, they advised me to call at 11am when they opened to reserve my call-ahead table. I then called at 11am and spoke to Jasmine who was very rude and unprofessional. She told me that all the tables were booked for the full day and that I should have called at 7am when the managers arrive there. She then informed me that I had no chance of getting a table, and gave me the \"Sorry bout your luck\" attitude. Since this was not my fault I was very upset. She offered no help and quickly hung up. I DO NOT recommend this restaurant to ANYONE, and unless you want your Valentines day dinner to be ruined, I recommend eating elsewhere."}
{"text":"We had our New Year's Eve dinner last night the service was top and the food just as good served hot and tasty are server was Justin was very Nice and friendly and the seaters were just as great see you soon again I'm sure"}
{"text":"Had fein for crab legs..late night my desire for seafoid a must.  My neighbor enjoyed the meals...although we arrived near the 10pm time the staff was very nice and professional.  Ordered the \" Clam Chowder Soup\"  & \"Lettuce Wrap with Hawaiian Shrimp\"  Wanted a smaller meal late night.  The soup as always excellent with the cheese biscuits. Did not care too much for the shrimp. Do not want to low rate Red Lobster, think it was my pallette..Raspberry and Mango tea made up for that.  Neighbor ordered \"Admirals Feast & 1Pound Crab\".. 6 Yea I know food was excellent.  Although too heavey for me, I helped myself but one cluster...also had a margirita special side of grand mariner....   Great late night."}
{"text":"The food was good, lobster feast was on. The cheddar biscuits seem to be a different recipe and not as good."}
{"text":"We came to RedLobster for a change of pace.   1. When we were seated the host went to pick up receipts still on the table from the last patrons. The table was so sticky they stuck and tore. No one wiped the table.  2. A mom at the next table said to her 6 year old looking kid 'do you want me to smack you in front of all these people' 3. The food made me feel bad about myself.   This is about what I expected."}
{"text":"Stopped in tonight for a little pre-Christmas seafood. We arrived and were promptly seated. Order a cocktail hat was pretty good but a little bit sweeter than I like. It had mango purée in it.   Everything from being sat quickly, our order taken quickly and efficiently to timing of our meal components was great.   They were out of a few hints that were disappointing like the red shrimp and the glasses our drinks were supposed to come in.   They have the greatest smashed potato topped with shrimp and lobster but don't let them fool you. If you try to sub this for your 2 included sides it isn't going to happen it is still an additional  7.99 but so worth every penny.   The cheddar bay biscuits are heavenly too.   We also ordered a couple rum runners that were far better than the sugary sweet drink from the menu.  We spent about 120.00 for 4 drinks and two meals I think that is adequate and we are satisfied. Service and food was good."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Had to track down the waitress to pay the bill. We ordered before anyone in our section and had our food last"}
{"text":"The service was second to none. I sat at the bar and saw a lot of interaction between the servers, customers with to go orders, and who were stirring at the bar. Each and everyone of them were polite to each other and the customers. The food was just like every other Red Lobster but the service was the best of any location I've been to."}
{"text":"Today was the extension of my anniversary since we couldnt find crab legs in Vegas last night!! An let me start by saying this! My waiter was absolutely awesome!!! Ask for Cameron if you come to this location!!! Starting off I asked \"how you doin today\"? His response was \" better now that y'all are here\"!! Took me by surprise!! And the night got better from there!! He made sure everything was perfect! My drink was fine an my wife's didnt have enough ice blended in her Bahama Mama. He had it made to her liking!! From the salads to the sides was good. An the crab legs were done just right. Sometimes we get treated a lil different! But the whole evening was truly enjoyable!! Been to this location more than a few times. Always good!! But tonight was a blessing!! Thanks!!"}
{"text":"Started off bad with a seater! Wife asked to speak to a manager as i got some air!! Came back in an the manager (Tony) was there. He made up for everything quick!! If i owned a business now he is the kind of manager i want running my business! Service was awesome! Sean was the server. Never had to ask for anything. He was always passing an asking if we need something. Food was very good!! An I understand its hit or miss with the fishing seasons. But the portions were good and was very filling!! And the drinks were good as well! Didnt have to ask for any alcohol in my alcohol!! If you know what I mean."}
{"text":"Ok,so this is my second time at Red Lobster. Our server was Bonita and she was extremely pleasant. She checked on us maybe 3 times or so,our food came on time,I ordered pirate isle jumbo coconut with rice as side,I had a salad as starter and their delicious biscuit and my husband ordered a lobster feast,everything was good,our experience was good and we will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I've only been to Red Lobster a total of two times since I immigrated to Canada 18 years ago. I've never been much of a seafood chain person, and usually if I end up eating seafood I would choose a local establishment over a chain place. However, the endless shrimp offer was quite enticing to my parents and I, so I decided to give Red Lobster another try.  There's surprisingly not a lot of Red Lobsters in the GTA. This branch serves most of Scarborough and virtually all of Markham, so it's not surprising that it was a 45 minute wait on a Saturday evening. Eventually my family got a table and we were given menus.  Our server took quite long to come, but eventually she did. We were quick to order endless shrimp for 3, choosing the habanero coconut bites, teriyaki grilled shrimp, shrimp linguini alfredo, and garlic shrimp. We also ordered a lobster bisque for starters.  The server initially gave us biscuits as an appetizer. My tip for people coming here is to have ONE only and pack the rest home. Those biscuits really fill you up, and if they do the endless shrimp deal won't be worth it for you. I'll give some credit and say the biscuits were very delicious...but very addictive.  The lobster bisque was quite good for a chain restaurant. It's obviously not west coast/east coast quality, but there were definitely actual lobster pieces inside, and the bisque was creamy as well.  As for the endless shrimp, we reordered the coconut bites and teriyaki grilled shrimp, as we found those two to be the best of the four (not fried, but both had their own unique sauce which was tasty). The shrimp linguini alfredo was too thick and filling, so if you want to maximize the endless offer I would skip that option (in addition to the breaded shrimp).  Service was hit and miss, especially in the first 10-15 minutes where we were left without a server. Eventually she apologized and did frequently return to refill our waters and asked if everything was alright.  Overall, this place was okay. It's not a place I will return immediately, but it does its job for a low-end price chain seafood restaurant."}
{"text":"The family and I came here for dinner on a Friday night for a some sea food. This was a horrible experience! The hostess rushed is to our seats and and just left us standing there. Then while sitting there a very large cockroach scuttled across the aisle  and under our table. So we decided to leave. I will not be coming back here ."}
{"text":"The food is great and so is the service. I used to go here often until I saw the lobsters alive inside a little tank all squeezed into one corner and staring at me in the eye. I decided to skip red lobster and go to another restaurant that didn't remind me of what a terrible human I am."}
{"text":"Typical red lobster. Waiter was awesome. Very attentive but not to a point of annoying. Wife had the coconut shrimp which was delish. I had the steak which was a risk and turned out to be somewhat of a struggle. Not docking any points as to be fair that's not their thing. Skipped out on the lobster as I've always found them to be on the salty side. Much prefer the keg lobster personally. Biscuits always great and love that it's unlimited. Don't forget to get a batch to go."}
{"text":"Upon arrival we noticed there is plenty parking and the location is literally right off the freeway. The staff was friendly and very helpful with questions regarding the menu.  Our drinks stayed topped off although the top shelf long Island iced teas are weak. At $8 a piece be prepared to spend damn near $30 to get a buzz on.  The salads were good and very filling. My wife ordered the steak cooked rare but the steak showed up over cooked. Instead of sending it back we decided to just have it removed from the bill.  The manager came to our table to personally apologize for the mistake of the incorrect cooking of the steak. The manager also gave. My wife a free desert to make up for the steak.  The bathroom was very clean and well maintained both men's and women's bathrooms.  We will more and likely return to this location in the future but we may not order food that Red Lobster doesn't specialize in such as steak."}
{"text":"It was your typical Red Lobster experience.  The food was good but not great (except for the biscuits, I dream about those bad boys), it took care of my craving for clam chowder and fried shrimp.  The server I had was nice and he was pretty quick with bringing everything to me and making sure my water was filled.  I think \"A-OK\" pretty much sums up the whole thing."}
{"text":"Stop here because we had a taste for shrimp and cheddar biscuits. The shrimp special all you can eat was tender and brought out hot and in a timely manner especially good was the Korean shrimp. Surprisingly the shrimp were tender and juicy. Our waiter was very attentive and one of the best waiters I have ever had Michael.  Can't beat it for a quick meal with Pleasant surroundings are really good waiter and decent food"}
{"text":"This might have been my worst experience at a Red Lobster. It was pretty bad. We sat at the bar and I watched the bartender struggle to keep up on a very slow night. I watched her make a customers drink wrong. It was a martini...she made it in a rocks glass with a ton of ice. About 6 minutes later the customer was able to get her attention to let the bartender know she wanted it in a martini glass without ice. The bartender took the glass poured in a shaker and poured the now super watered down drink into a martini glass. The bartended should have known by the look of dissatisfaction on the customers face that she was not happy. She should've just remade that drink.   I watched her place her hands on the inside of every glass she grabbed. Granted she probably washed them but it still wasn't necessary to finger fudge everyone's glasses.   The food was quite mediocre. Salmon was over cooked. The highlight of the meal was the whipped sweet potatoes. My fiancée has made the decree that Red Lobster is now on the list of places we will never return to. It's bad that when I leave Red Lobster and finish paying the $80 check I wished that I would have went next door to the Hooters.   Damn...now I want wings."}
{"text":"Just ate here with my kids. They no longer give you a starter salad, pretty disappointed, I got lobster tail n two different shrimps sides grilled shrimp and butter shrimp, mashed potatoes.   No broccoli, I'm am just soooo shocked.  Everything was extremely salty and basically small.   I will never come again nor will I ever cheat on my diet for this terrible food...oh and not to mention the kraft dinner for the kids meal. Smh"}
{"text":"Admittedly I've only eaten here a couple times, but I find the food at Red Lobster is a bit hit or miss in my opinion, with some dishes being a little bland.  The coconut shrimp is pretty good though, and they sometimes have very competitive promotions, such as the current 4 course seafood feast for $17.99    The best part of the meal is always the biscuits, which is kind of funny really, considering that this is a seafood restaurant.  But wow, those biscuits are good."}
{"text":"We stopped by for dinner and sort of get dropped.  Zach, the manager came by after a few minutes and immediately took our drink order as well as an appetizer on the house.  He continued to check in and made sure our server took extremely good care of us.  What started out in the wrong direction was changed to a BIG POSITIVE by a manager that is truly watching his business.  We will come back again!!!"}
{"text":"You better drink lots of water, because your sodium level will skyrocket while dining here!   Red Lobster reminds me of a casual restaurant similar to White Spot. You have to a wait a few minutes in line, but the staff seat you politely and generally they have a good attitude. The food comes up pretty quickly- salads first, apps second, entrée last- so you won't be left hanging.  I found the food to be unmemorable but decent. The seafood is very salty, as other reviewers have mentioned. The apps are fried quite thoroughly and have an acceptable taste. Salads are incredibly ho-hum considering that they are really just leaves + dressing; no fancy embellishments here!   If you're a Red Lobster member you get deals and coupons via email sometimes; otherwise Red Lobster isn't bad but isn't that good either."}
{"text":"I went here for the All You Can Eat Shrimp feast for my birthday. I was accompanied by my husband, daughter, and best friend.   Normally, there are people packed outside waiting a good 30 minutes when the all you can eat comes around. I was really surprised that we didn't have to wait at all for a seat. They sat us in the back and it was really nice that they put us in a half booth, half regular table with 2 chairs instead of trying to shove us on the busiest isle and having my infant daughter hanging out in the way. Big bonus points to the hostess!   Our waiter seemed to have that, 'I really care about my clients' attitude, but we all know it's just for the tips. At least he was cute. Since the restaurant wasn't packed to the gills, our waiter (don't remember his name) was pretty good in keeping up with drink refills and plate refills. He let us order 2 at a time, instead of 1 at a time which they normally do. The only thing that was annoying is the fact that I got my husband's baked potato, and he got my mashed potatoes, and whenever cocoanut shrimp was ordered, they always forgot the sauce that goes with it. When my best friend decided to tell our waiter that it was my birthday, he was all for sending a bunch of people over and singing. I guess it was because I'm not those type of people that try to hide under the table when that happens or something, but the singing never commenced. I'm not bummed out about it or anything, I was just surprised that it didn't happen. Oh well....  Over all, even though their prices are a little high for the quality of the food, I still had a good experience here. Hopefully the trend will continue..."}
{"text":"What can I say? It's Red Lobster. It's been around for decades and it seems like they are trying hard to catch up with modern restaurants these days, but just can't seem to do it right.  I've been here a couple of times in the last two years and I've ordered a seafood pasta dish and fish and chips. Both were not memorable, greasy, and not flavourful. It seems like their fish and chips may have been frozen. It didn't taste crispy and it was quite disappointing. The only thing this place deserves possibly four stars for is their biscuits.   The service is decent. The servers are friendly, but the service can be a bit on the slow side especially during the lunch hour. The prices are also a bit high considering the quality of food you get."}
{"text":"red lobster was ok!  The endless shrimp feast was decent but for some reason, it left me with after taste and hungry again a few hours later.  Maybe im just not a seafood guy."}
{"text":"Since I was given a gift card, I decided to try Red Lobster...it's been over 10 years since I've eaten at this restaurant chain. All I can remember is the breaded shrimp, deep fried foods and the cheesy biscuit.  Well, now I know why it's been so long. It's either the chefs or the food.  Jen was our waitress who was very polite and professional. She took very good care of us. My wife had a Fat Tire draft which was pretty pricey at $5 a glass and their lemonade was $2.79 which was mostly all ice.  My wife and I ordered Caesar salad. the romaine lettuce was cold and crunchy with several croûtons. Should have had the dressing on the side. I had the Garlic Crab-and-Shrimp Pasta and my wife had the crab stuffed mushrooms.   My dish was pretty salty and could barely taste the garlic crab. The shrimp was unshelled and plentiful, but the Parmesan cheese cream sauce overwhelmed the crab and shrimp and was probably the source of the saltiness. The linguine was cooked okay.  Would I go back...eh...most likely not."}
{"text":"I was in the mood for some seafood, but I didn't want to sit and dine in at a restaurant. I decided to call and place an order to go. The person in the phone was very pleasant. My order only took about 15 minutes. When I arrived I was greeted by a very welcoming host and was directed to the bar for my to go order. The bartender Dallas was very professional and even brought my order out on a platter and made sure everything was correct before putting it in the to go bag. The food is delicious as always and too expensive. Overall this was a very pleasant experience. I would definitely return and I recommend this restaurant to anyone."}
{"text":"After a tough hike at Mount Charleston, the girlfriend and I were ready for a meal, so Red Lobster came up, and on we went.  We were greeted promptly by the hostess and sat quickly. Within a minute our server Kim started us off with two sodas and a \"create your own\" appetizer. We selected the calamari and the chicken strips. The calamari with fried broccoli was great, and the chicken strips were pretty standard, not expecting much there.   Entree wise, we both chose the Lobster/Shrimp/Scallops combo with a side salad, steamed broccoli, and wild rice pilaf. I opted for a soup and the potato bacon soup was rich and delicious. The lobster was decent, a bit overcooked, however the shrimp, rice pilaf, and scallops were awesome. Of course, I don't have to say much about the biscuits, you know everyone loves them.   The best thing about the meal was Kim. She was very attentive, our drinks were never empty, and she would lighten up the mood with her great personality. I would hire her to be in my restaurant on the strip in a HEARTBEAT. Kim is genuinely about your experience and she sells items the right way. That's what it's about. A true server, a seller, not a boring order taker, a true combination of what every server should be like.   We opted out of dessert because we were pretty full as is. The food was decent, not horrible for a chain restaurant, the service was excellent, and the decor was pretty relaxing. Great stuff. See you when the unlimited shrimp comes around. ;)"}
{"text":"The first problem we had was upon arrival; we waited 15 minutes for a table when larger parties that arrived after us were seated first. Okay no problem, they seemed busy. Except for the fact that when we were seated, there were plenty of empty tables. The salad I ordered had some frozen lettuce in it. The tasteless soup we ordered had a hair in it! I seriously considered leaving right then but we had already ordered our main dishes. My main dish came out with the wrong sides, but I guess mistakes happen. To top it off, our server could not remember anything we asked for even after being reminded multiple times. First time ever eating at Red Lobster, and definitely the last."}
{"text":"I wait One Whole Year to came for the All You can eat Shrimp . Im  only giving 2 's One for our good server , Eduardo; Eduardo was very nice he was fixing this situation Way better then the Manager Rhonda    My first serving was very good ( Hot )  But when I received the next serving of shrimp scampi it was COLD ... We asked the Manager RHONDA to check in the kitchen maybe something was not heating and or not keeping the food hot!! Before going to check Manager Rhonda had an excuse . \" That the sauce that they pour over the shrimp, is different the the first serving \" what does that have to do with the food being COLD  is me on me , You can actually see the butter in the scampi getting thick, I showed RHONDA this and asked her to feel the shrimp but Manager RHONDA was not listening, I said its ok I'll take them home and heat them up.... Manager Rhonda Said oh No you can take them home , ok that was fine , I hope they don't give them to someone else?? RHONDA are  very unprofessional."}
{"text":"The food was ay okay. It was not hot just warm The tables were way too small for our party of four  Yet the service was amazing"}
{"text":"Service was 1/5 everything asked for was forgotten. Ate half the meals with out the proper sauces. 15 mins for refills on drinks. Extremely average food for the price. Dark atmosphere very blah."}
{"text":"I ordered my food to go at 5:02 and they said it would be ready in twenty minutes. When I arrived at 5:35 it was not ready. The bartender on duty was NOT A BARTENDER. One drink he was making as with every drink; he had to check EACH ingredient which he did not know where to find at the bar. By 5:52 my food was ready to go. Got home.... NO BISCUITS.  I don't understand a management that allows so many employees walking around a half empty restaurant while others wait for service. Also I don't like to see a server drinking her Starbucks drink before greeting me after she had already noticed me. Made me feel like I was second on her priority. Three stars for the fish, shrimp, crabs, baked potato. Minus two stars for disappointing service and management."}
{"text":"I can't say enough about the service!  Our waiter (I forgot his name! ) was amazing! 2 of us got the endless shrimp and we couldn't keep up with him!!! We tried every type and they were hot, fresh and deliciously! My husband wasn't very  hungry and got the potato soup, which he didn't care for, but our waiter did everything he could to make it right.  I hadn't been to Red Lobster in at least 5 years after the continuous poor service and sub-par food. But that has CHANGED!  We will be coming back for sure!"}
{"text":"It seems like once every two years I get a craving for Red Lobster and if I visit that infrequently then it will really hit the spot. I'm not usually a chain person, but our experience here really was great.  We arrived and were immediately greeted. Once seated our waitress arrived and she was friendly and efficient. I always forget the niche that places like Red Lobster fill....an experience similar to sit down service, but much quicker. I also love that bread and salads come out right away making it an excellent option for those times when I'm hangry.  I had the Ultimate Feast because I couldn't decide on one thing. This really was a good deal and a ridiculous amount of food. The shrimp scampi, lobster, and fried shrimp were great. They really hit the spot. The crab legs reminded me of why I started preferring Joe's Crab Shack and haven't been here in two years. The crab legs are always rubbery and impossible to break. They taste fine, but are nearly impossible to get into. Not a big deal at all. Avoid getting crab here, but everything else is delicious in that salty, buttery way.   For sides I had mashed potatoes and grilled corn with parmesan. The corn was awesome and reminded me of Mexican street corn. The potatoes tasted instant, but were doctored up with sauce. For awhile the cheddar rolls tasted off, but on this visit they were delicious again. It tasted like they went back to the original recipe.  My husband had the Lobster Pizza and the Crispy Shrimp Lettuce Wraps. These are both large portions and only one is necessary if enjoying as a meal.  The price, good service, quick service, and decent food make this a win as far as seafood chains go."}
{"text":"Very bad food and it costs a fortune. Pictures and menu is very attractive actual food is very ordinary. Shrimps are very small size you do not expect this from a seafood restaurant. I have been to red lobster jn the US it is much better. This one is not even close. Looks like the management is cutting too much cost to give low quality food at high prices. We ordered crab fritters lobster linguini and seafood platter. All very below average in taste and quality"}
{"text":"If it was possible to leave a zero, I would. Terrible hostess, server was inattentive, rude and put someone else's dirty dishes on our table while we were eating! The food was rubbery and cold. The manager said he would send us a gift card and it never came. I have always loved Red Lobster, but this place and the manager who bs'd is in to thinking he cared will never have our business again."}
{"text":"Minha experiência nessa unidade da Red Lobster foi em geral boa. Ao chegar, a espera foi curta, a atendente disse 20 minutos, mas não deu nem 10 para sermos colocados em uma mesa. O garçom foi muito paciente, explicando cada prato que perguntávamos ou qualquer outra dúvida que tivemos. Inclusive indicou opções mais vantajosas em relação ao que estávamos querendo comer. (Uma coisa que não gostei foi que ao terminar de comer a sobremesa, ele ofereceu café e já trouxe a conta sem pedirmos, não achei muito educado. Até porque estávamos pensando em pedir outra sobremesa, porque não estávamos satisfeitos. Acabamos pagando e não pedindo mais nada.) O ambiente é bom, bem confortável, o ambiente de refeição é limpo. Mas o banheiro é bem precário, papéis de mão da pior qualidade, cheiro ruim e não estava muito limpo. Os preços são altos sim, mas as porções são grandes e compensam os valores. Sem contar que o sabor da comida é muito bom! Tanto a lagosta como o caranguejo são ótimos, vale a pena provar lá! Em geral, minha nota fica em 3 estrelas, pois penso que um restaurante nesse nível poderia melhorar ainda no atendimento e na limpeza do banheiro."}
{"text":"My parents live in a senior home just down the street from here.  I come to this restaurant when I am in the area.  It's by far the best service I have received.  I often come by myself or with my husband.  We love the people here!"}
{"text":"Came for a friend's bday. While the food is ok, they did a great job on service so hence the extra star.  Got the crab, scallop, shrimp  pot. The crab didnt come cracked and it was the snow crab where the shell is a bit too soft to make cracking easy. Eh, it was ok. But the wait staff was great and the manager even came over to wish my friend a happy bday. Thought that was a nice gesture.  They had a peach lemonade which was made with peach purree that was pretty yummy."}
{"text":"My daughter took me tonight for my birthday!  Our waiter Fernando was great! He was very attentive, kind and could tell he liked his job. It was a wonderful evening!"}
{"text":"If you've been to a Red Lobster before then skip my review.  If not, well then, continue on...so we came here for lunch. It's the usual routine:  drinks, biscuits, appetizer then main entree.  We ordered the 3 item sea side sampler which was really delicious. Later our main course arrived.  My wife ordered the Ultimate Feast which she enjoyed but couldn't finish. I order the Endless  Shrimp which in my case ended after the main entree and one additional shrimp plate.  I think it is possible to have too much of a good thing.  And since you can't take it with you, that was my lunch curtain call.  I would have given it four stars if our server would have shown up a little more, refilled our drinks sooner, that kind of thing.  But there's always room for improvement."}
{"text":"My wife and I went there last night for my 50th Birthday because I was craving Clam chowder and a steak. I selected the New York steak and lobster. The lobster was over cooked, and really lacked flavor. The steak was okay. Had Med. Rare but it was a little tough, and also lacked flavor. Now the chowder was not good. It was thin, had few clams, no potatoes. I am pretty sure the chowder was a canned base. Also the broccoli was frozen broccoli. It was definitely not fresh. For $42.00 the broccoli should have been fresh and the clam chowder should have been made from scratch. I was really disappointed in the quality. I guess I should have known better."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here last night, and he had the endless shrimp,and I had the platter of, lobster tail, salmon, wild rice, shrimp & Brussels sprouts. The Brussels sprouts were cooked too hard, and burnt. The bread took forever to come out, however, my server had great customer service. I might not go back for awhile."}
{"text":"this is just high priced captain D's. they quality has gone downhill over the past decade now I remember WHY I don't eat here."}
{"text":"My wife and I went here Friday night. Trying to beat the rush we got there at 5:30pm to our surprise this place was packed. We got in and found that we had a 30min wait. Now I won't usually say something about a chain restaurant but in this case I have to. First of all we were seated just 15min after our arrival and it just got better from there. The service and the food were on point. Most places you go if they are busy something has to suffer. Not here. You could tell by the high visibility of the manager and the way he treated his staff that he was creating an environment of success.  The food was fresh and well prepared and the wait staff was fantastic. Didn't have to wait for anything and we were in and out just over an hour. Great job guys. You have got to check them out!!!"}
{"text":"Red Lobster is to lobster as Swiss Chalet is to chicken but Swiss Chalet's chicken is better."}
{"text":"They opened around spring and I've been here maybe three times? Some of the wait staff needs to be more attentive and welcoming. I was seated near the bar area and our server came only to take orders, give us the food and to hand the check. He never checked for refills or if we had any issues. We had to flag him down just to get the check.  Other times, the servers were great.   I've had better food from other Red Lobsters. Hopefully this location improves because I see great potentials for this location.   I've eaten at the food chain multiple of time but this location isn't as great. Head over to the location at Pineville."}
{"text":"Erin our server was amazing. I wish I could say the same about the lobster. It was chewy."}
{"text":"Okay, I don't usually review large nationwide chains like this, but this particular red lobster was so bad that I couldn't help it.  My favorite part of red lobster back at home is the cheesy bread they give you at the beginning.  I LOVE their bread back at home.  The bread alone was enough to justify going to red lobster.  But here at this Cleveland red lobster, the bread was small, and kind of stale and dry!  And the quality of the rest of the food echoed the quality of the bread.  Stale, and dry.  I guess there are many ways to see food differently."}
{"text":"Horrible! We moved here from San Diego and red lobster was one of our weekly restaurants, so you could imagine  how disappointed we were to have such a bad experience here at this local red lobster. I guess that's what we get for going to a seafood restaurant in the middle of the desert.our waitress was great.very nice and attentive.the food was terrible. we ordered an appetizer and a salad which came out at the same time.which would not have been so bad except the entrees came out two bites into the salads.so need less to say we had to choose whether we ignore our appetizer or our dinner.our appetizer went cold.i would have spoken up, but the manager walked past our table 7 times ignoring us every pass.but yet he spent the entire dinner 4 tables down talking to some guests that I could only assume we're his friends. all this could be ignored if the food itself wasn't so bad.i will not be returning to this restaurant and I will make sure to advise any of my friends, family or customers to steer clear of this place as well."}
{"text":"It was my first time at red lobster. Had a gift card and oh man. So good the biscuits were out of this world and we ordered stuffed mushrooms which were so good. I was burning my mouth off trying to eat them and I didn't care. Then we split the works dinner which included a little bit of everything. Not going to lie neither of us new how to open crab legs so we had a fun time making fun of each other trying to do it. But everything was good once we did figure it out. Our waiter was a bit awkward but no worries. Another thing we made fun of while we ate. If you like sea food. This is a good spot. It is a bit corporate. If you're looking for something more ma and pa homie type of food this isn't the spot."}
{"text":"The food was absolutely great. I've been seeing the shrimp lovers ad on TV and had a craving for the last week. Had every kind of shrimp they were offering! I found the service efficient and plesant. My only gripe was that it took so long to be seated, (about 20 minutes), but what can you expect in a busy place with good food at dinnertime. My Son had the Surf and Turf and loved it. Nice evening out!"}
{"text":"I have not been to Red Lobster in a long time since my last experience was not too great.  But that was in California.  I was hoping the LV RL would be different.   My son loves crab legs so this is a good time to check out RL.  The service was outstanding.  Our waitress- Ardell was very very attentive and really deserved the big tip I gave her.   I AM disappointed in the portions of the crab- as if it was anorexic.  Am I just too spoiled with the LV buffets??? My ceasar salad was ok- the leaves were quite wilted and a bit too much on the dressing.   The biscuits were always as good as I remember.  I had asked for medium on the steak and it was barely pink inside which made it quite tough.  When I told the waitress about it,...she took it and was gonna get me the steak the way I wanted it originally and w/out hesitation.   Got the Alfredo and I was gonna get the shrimp w/ it but Ardell tempted me w/ the crab alfredo.  Yum....that was a good choice.  My steak finally came but I was already done eating.   By this time the manager came to the table and I did not even have to ask- she informed me I will only get charged for two choices rather than three because the steak was not done right.  HOW NICE... My son was satisfied w/ his crab legs.....he was just so happy he got them.     Overall I wish there was this kind of service at any establishment.  This was the best service I have had in a long time.   The food  was A-ok.  It will pass.  But pound per pound and dollar per dollar.....I will have to choose seafood buffets."}
{"text":"Had clam chowder. Complained about lack of clams. Waiter told me is canned.  I was astounded . $6.49 for a bowl of canned soup. Ridiculous.  NEVER again."}
{"text":"I know this is a chain restaurant but I had a gift card for this or Olive Garden so I went with this. It's Crabfest so I decided to give the platter a try. I've been here before and remember while it's not the best in seafood it's still pretty decent.  My food my good but the service definitely lacked. My server Kaitlyn was not pleasant at all and never smiled once she looked like she was forced to be there. The manager came by she asked how everything was I told her the food was good but that I was concerned about Kaitlyn. I said she slammed two plates down already at our table and has no emotion and has never smiled. She was like oh ok well I can assure you it will be pleasant. If by pleasant she meant Kaitlyn would still come by with a grimace she was right she never smiled even after the fact and took forever to pick up the check."}
{"text":"Great food and good service. The bar harbor lobster bake is definitely a winner! The cheddar biscuits are awesome as always. Bring your appetite because there portions are very filling."}
{"text":"I've been to Red Lobster many times. I went for the first time in about 5 years and had the wood fire grilled lobster tail, scallops, and shrimp. The lobster was ok, maybe a little overcooked, the scallops were good, the shrimp were disappointing. Not much flavor or texture about the quality of the shrimp you see at a Mega Chinese Buffet. Undoubtedly farm raised.  The service was good, and I didn't wait long for my food. But I had a terrible seat by the restroom. No joke, when someone would enter or exit the big swinging door would give me a waft of bathroom odors.   The food wasn't terrible, but I seem to remember it being a little better. Maybe it is in California. Aside from the seating, it was an ok experience, but I'm not itching to go back. If I get an urge for seafood, I will consult yelp for something better."}
{"text":"At Red Lobster I had the shrimp plate and fries. For dessert I had Strawberry Shortcake in a jar which is seasonal by the way. My sister had the NY Strip Steak and mashed potatoes. Everything was hot and delicious! You get a lot for your money. The service was fast and they were super nice. There was plenty of parking. I recommend this location."}
{"text":"I usually have very good food at this restaurant  but went there last week for the lobster fest. Payed 30+ for the meal and the two lobster tails I had were very chewy and we're like rubber. I  will never do that again. Maybe they sat for a Long time. A lot of money to waste."}
{"text":"Disappointing dinner.  Coconut shrimp was dry and tough.  Rock lobster tail was not cooked all the way through.  When the manager came to check on our complaint, he responded that the lobster tail looked thoroughly cooked to him.  Slippery and translucent isn't seafood cooked thoroughly...  We sent it back on a small plate and it was returned on the same small plate, cooked thoroughly.  We feel our complaint should have been handled more professionally.  If the customer says the seafood isn't cooked thoroughly, an apology and a fresh lobster tail is in order.  We love the Red Lobster restaurants but would not return to this one."}
{"text":"Worst red lobster i have been to. Came here ob a rainy late afternoon. The whole restaurant was empty. Service was nothing stellar. But not dreadful. They brought out their signature red lobster biscuits. That was the best part of our whole meal.  Ordered the calamari appetizer. Dont get it unless you are expecting to get breaded fried bell peppers and broccoli. Seriously, there were hardly any squid. And the breading was extremely weird, not breading well, the crumbs were fall off. The seasoning was also off. Overall that appetizer ended up being a disaster. It was over $10. By this point, we were ready to leave, I'd rather finish off the rest of my meal elsewhere."}
{"text":"I've been waiting so long to come here I was beyond excited. We came in for dinner last night and were seated right away. We ordered the roasted garlic mussels and stuffed mushrooms as appetizers and I ordered a frozen strawberry margarita. Everything except for my drink came out quickly.  Our appetizers looked and tasted good but I was obsessed with their biscuit that was seasoned differently from others biscuits I've had before and simply divine! On the other hand, my drink tasted like strawberry flavored ice, not at all like a margarita. I then ordered the crab linguini alfredo and added a lobster to it. Seriously, it was AMAZING! So flavorful!   Service was really good here, staff is very attentive and friendly. Only downside for me was, they have one side that leads you to the restaurant adapted for disabled costumers and the other side, coming from the parking lot, has steps making it inconvenient for costumers with a stroller - it was our first time here so we didn't know.  Overall we had a great time here, enjoyed good food and were able to just relax."}
{"text":"Arrived around 730 on a Monday and to our surprise there was a wait....Lobsterfest was the cause.  We were told we would have a 15 minute wait....no problem.  30 minutes later we hadnt been called, the hostess was very nice upon realizing they had forgotten us and we were seated immediately.    Ordered the lobster dip and lobster lover's dream.  Appetizer was 20+ minutes to the table but biscuits and salad kept us pacified for most of that.  The dip comes with tortilla chips and was a bit thin and greasy for my liking.    Entrees came 10-15 minutes after our appetizer was done.  Lobster Lover's Dream was very good.  Mashed potatoes,  two kinds of lobster, and pasta with shrimp and lobster. ($31.99)  We had a coupon for a free appetizer ($12.99) with two lobsterfest entrees.  Talia, our waitress was very nice and apologetic for any delays.  She kept our water full and boxed our food up for us including some extra biscuits.  Aside from the delays the food was good!"}
{"text":"We had brittney as our waitress and we absolutely loved her. She was attentive and brought refills and bread before having to ask. I looked around and it's sad to say that everyone else was grumpy and down each other's throats while brittney was alway smiling and just getting her job done. The rest of the employees need to brighten up."}
{"text":"Beware!!!  My mother had her credit card number lifted while lunching at the bar yesterday.  They ran all over Tempe and Mesa purchasing clothes etc.  The Fraud department from the bank flagged the purchases, thank god.  I phoned the restaurant this morning and spoke with manager CeCe.  Instead of taking ownership she choose to explain to me how this never happens there and that she could not address her staff but would try and find time to discuss with her managers.  VERY DISAPPOINTING!!!  Ownership of an issue is critical."}
{"text":"We love us some Red Lobster!!!  My boys beg to go here. Everything is always clean and food is hot and fresh tasting.  Something that makes this location stand out is that there is always a manager on the floor!"}
{"text":"Worst red lobster experience I've had. Dingy interior, slow service (never got offered water) and stingy with the biscuits. Also saw an employee leave the bathroom without washing his hands  (from a stall too). I love red lobster but won't be coming back to this location"}
{"text":"I went to Red Lobster for the first time in my life.  It will be the last time. The service was very good and the atmosphere was pleasant but the food was marginal at best.  Clam chowder needed clams and less salt, shrimp were extremely small on the plate I had.  Not worth the money."}
{"text":"Big disappointment - looking forward to lobster rolls but they're no longer on the menu.  What I noticed was that the restaurant appeared cold and uninviting. After a recent remodel the place was dark and drab.  And the lobby was actually cold     No need to settle for another dish when there are plenty of other restaurants close by on Bell Road.  So I'm outta here..."}
{"text":"We LOVE endless shrimp and always look forward to it every year. We will NOT be going back to this location again! Our server Marc was wonderful, but when the runner brought out our food, my stomach turned. I was excited to try the two new flavors and opted for the Mediterranean first. As I looked at my two skewers, I noticed the shrimp was not fully cooked. They were still grey, with a few showing light spots of pink. I wish I had taken a picture! Our server comes over to see if everything is okay and immediately notices my shrimp and says \"ohhhh....\" I was no longer interested in trying out the Mediterranean shrimp so I just got another serving of the scampi, which is my favotite. After a few minutes, I asked for the manager. I wanted management to know what the kitchen was putting out because I was genuinely concerned that someone could get sick. I never got her name, which was a mistake, but she was the worst! She was probably in her 50's with long blonde hair and glasses. I told her my concern, showed her the shrimp, and she had the audacity to try and tell me that it was grill marks!!! My mother's were not completely cooked as well, but much better looking than mine. She looks at my mom and asks her \"so...you like them well done?!\" YOU'VE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME!!! No lady. We just like our food COOKED!!! If we wanted it raw, we would have gone out for sushi! Right then and there I should've gotten her name and the bill. My son is the only one who enjoyed his meal. He ordered the chicken tacos with french fries. I took a bite of his and it was good! I will drive out of my way to another location, but won't be back to this one. I can't support a business where the management is so unprofessional as to insult a patron and pass off undercooked food as \"grill marks.\" There was no apology from her, no follow up to see how the rest of the meal was...absolutely nothing that would make me want to return."}
{"text":"I have never been to Red Lobster up until this point in my life. I am 27. I never want to go back to Red Lobster ever again.  I was whisked away to RL over this past weekend for a dinner birthday celebration for my brother. He wanted lobster, my parents immediately thought of RL. I really wish we had gone somewhere else.  Everything in this place is salted beyond belief. I guarantee you they serve the food this way because they are catering to the general American public and the general American public have an overly iodized taste (in my opinion). I ordered one of their shrimp dishes, and selected the shrimp scampi and seafood stuffed shrimps. YUCK on both accounts. The shrimp \"scampi\" was coated in butter I'm very certain and it was horrendous. The stuffed shrimps were not any better. My salad came out slathered in ranch dressing (I should have asked for it on the side). The famous little cheddar bay biscuits were okay, but pretty dry.  The rest of my family got dishes with lobster tails, and I did have a few bites of the lobster. It was good, but nothing spectacular. However, I really have never had amazing lobster. But I doubt I'll ever get it at RL.  My favorite dish was the appetizer we ordered off of the \"build your own\" appetizer selection. We selected clam strips and mozzarella sticks. Well, it's pretty damn hard to mess up clam strips and I thought they were yummy. I think the mozzarella sticks could have been heated up a BIT more, but they were good none the less.  Our waitress was very nice, good humored, and very quick. She kept our drinks filled and was an all around champ about getting our food and clearing our plates. However - it was definitely mentioned that my brother was having a birthday - and NOTHING! No complimentary dessert! Seriously, RL? That was just really disappointing.  Needless to say I have no intention of ever returning to Red Lobster. If I'm going to throw down money on seafood it better be some effing good seafood and I know I'm not going to get it here."}
{"text":"I'm giving five stars for our server, Heather. She's a little brunette who should probably get a raise. My boyfriend and I dined at this location the other night and were thoroughly impressed by Heather's friendliness, knowledge and experienced nature during our meal.  The food was pleasant, especially given we sat down an hour and a half before the closing time and everything went very smoothly. We enjoyed the atmosphere and meal tremendously and were lucky to have had Heather as our server that night. My only regret is leaving her tip on my card instead of in cash!"}
{"text":"My wife and I have made a practice of dining here on at least an annual basis for special occasions for many, many years and experienced our customary level of perfection in service and food quality on our most recent visit today. My wife had excellent stuffed flounder, and I enjoyed the many available selections  on the endless shrimp platter. Of course no visit would be complete without the irresistible coconut shrimp appetizer! We are looking forward to our next visit.  (This is an updated review. I previously left a 3-star review on 7/31/17 mentioning what I am now sure was a one-off experience with a paltry proportion of crabmeat in their Alfredo dish on that one occasion. I now believe, as stated, that that was an isolated incident as we had no complaints with the servings or ingredient ratios on our visit today. I attempted to remove this prior review but was unable to do so)."}
{"text":"Don't even bother, it's full of terrible service, cold food and snotty managers that don't follow up on complaints. Go to Long John Silvers, you'll get better treatment and quality for money."}
{"text":"Cameron You Rock! Tonight we had the BEST server we have ever had. Not only did he make my kids night. He was so great interacting with them, making us laugh, and continually filling our drinks before they ever got empty. We never had to ask for a thing. Tonight was my sons 13 birthday and Red Lobster was what he chose for dinner. Our food came out quickly, it tasted amazing, and I swear Cameron was psychic with his abilities to know what my kids might like down to a to a go cup for both of the kids. Restaurants need more servers like him. Thanks for making our night such a great and memorable experience for our son.  Shout out to Cameron!"}
{"text":"my wife: everything about here made me mad  no happy hour, no to go bags for the food, servers who clearly don't want to be there - just part of the magical, family friendly dining experience you can expect from red lobster.  on the other hand you're eating at red lobster. I guess 2/5 is still a 100% improvement over what you'd expect, but it still doesn't make the experience any better  seriously no happy hour on a Wednesday at 5:30p? just because you're down the street from the grand poobah Mormon temple doesn't mean your business can't have fun"}
{"text":"It's 5:45 pm and the place was packed.  There was a 50 minute wait.  We sat at the bar and ordered a strawberry daiquiri-pina colada drink.  OMG! It's a very dangerous drink I must say.  It is soooo good, you can't even taste the alcohol.  After 35 minutes of waiting, we were seated.  Not long after we were seated, Carla, our assigned waitress, came up and greeted us with a big smile.  She took our order and not even 5 minutes, she brought us freshly baked biscuits with our appetizers, soup and salad.  I had the lobster bisque soup.  It is so rich and creamy that by the time my entree arrived, I was so full, I had to have it packed to go.  I ordered the surf and turf on the lobster fest menu and my daughter ordered the ultimate feast.  Both dishes were very delicious.  We were so stuffed, we didn't have time for dessert.  What made our dining experience at Red Lobster was the friendly staff.  From the bartender to the hostess and of course Carla and Quincy.  We will definitely dine there again. Thank you Carla, you are an asset to your company"}
{"text":"something about red lobster makes me go back. I like them no matter what. this location is very clean and friendly."}
{"text":"We sat at the bar, which was quieter & has a couple of tv's.  An attentive bartender & it's Red Lobster!  Consistent & tasty!  We go to Red Lobster once every couple of years (in whatever city we are in when the mood strikes!)... we reminisce about our childhoods & remember our families.    What better than this?"}
{"text":"When I want lobster & don't want to pay an arm & a leg for it I go to Red Lobster.    This location has quality of food as the Matthews one, so I don't feel gypped there, but the restaurant itself, meh.  The bar staff & area isn't very customer friendly. It's also got a weird pass-thru from the kitchen to the bar that's open to the bar area & it's noisy & you can hear everything every server is saying coming in & out of the kitchen with their food.    There's an ice machine right there as well as a frozen drink blender & it's NOISY! The staff also don't pay attention to you because they're always talking with each other at this pass-thru.  I wish they'd update the bar area a bit at least.  I'm sure the rest of the restaurant is typical."}
{"text":"I know I have commented on a reb lobster before the one in Concord, and I'm not a fan of seafood but enjoyed the steak and had an overall ok time until they messed with my money.  But this time around, a new one has opened up in my community in Matthews NC and it opened yesterday I went today just to use the gift card that I was given on my last visit and of course to support my local community.  Well it's really nice, and clean the staff are amazing.  Very helpful and polite people, and I know it's only because it's just it's second day of being in service.  Or who knows maybe the kindness will last even after the niceness go away....lol.  Any who the service was really slow, and I think it's because they are all trying to still get into their grooves.  We went around 5 and didn't leave til almost 8 and that's because we were waiting on food to come out, things to take home it was just crazy.  I ordered the steak again because I was impressed the last time, and this time I was very disappointed. Besides the fact that it didn't come out until I was bored of waiting for it.  But because it was done at all, I asked for it well and I got medium well and I'm not a fan of that.  By this time I was tired and ready to go, so I could stop by a burger joint and get a burger.  So I didn't get anything in it's place we waited for 30 minutes or more for the desserts, so needless to say but I'm going to I will never go back.  I felt it was my duty to support and that's what I did now I can say I did and that's it.....the end."}
{"text":"I don't like seafood, but I was with a bunch of people who wanted to go so I went for the sake of going.  I waitress was really over whelmed, yes it was super crowded yesterday as if it was a Holiday or something.  Any who, she kept forgetting things, and made several trips to our table and still managed to forget things.  I ordered a steak becasue like I mentioned before I don't like seafood.  Yeah I know steak at a seafood place strange right?  Well she forgot my sides to go with my steak, so that made me upset but I went on with it and waited until I got everything that I ordered with my meal.  The steak was absolutely incredible it was a mushroom wine sauce number and it was great, I think it had a demi glace sauce with it.  It was pure heaven, juicy tender just really good.  With the amount of food that was on my plate (which wasn't much) I didn't think it would fill me up, but it did it's job.  I was full at the end of my meal and I enjoyed it very much.  However our waitress took forever to bring to go boxes and the check.  I believe we spent more time waiting on things than we did eating.  I didn't enjoy the experience of being at red lobster, but the food was excellent, I will not go again.  But if you do, please try the steak I mentioned it was really good. I have an update I noticed the day I wrote this review that the waitress charged me for my meal and someone elses imagine that.  Had I not looked at my online account I would have not known, and get this to make me feel better.  I might get my money back in 3-5 days with a gift certificate wow isn't that sweet of them?  I have never been treated like this from a chain restaurant.  Never again..........."}
{"text":"One of the worse expensive meals ever. Salad was iceberg with a couple very small tomatoes, mashed potatoes were instant, and I am taking steak home to my dogs. Shrimp were okay- not exceptional."}
{"text":"Visited this location on 2/27 with a friend for Lobsterfest. I ordered the Lobster in Paradise.. The lobster was NOT fresh, it was tough and very chewy. I was really bummed out by this because I was really looking forward to trying this dish and I don't normally have any complaints about Red Lobster. The service was excellent, our waiter was very friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"First of all we have been going to Red Lobster for over 35 yrs, and it is getting increasingly more expensive by the day.  The prices are off the roof.  The preparation and quality of the items are not what they used to be.  Example the shrimp scampi, is not really scampi at all, it is flavorless has no breading and no hint of garlic at all.  The flounder on the Sailors Platter was also flavorless - it tasted as if they boiled it in water and put alittle paprika on it to look like it was baked...  If your going to serve these items as you do then you need to get a cook/chef that knows how to prepare them !!!"}
{"text":"If you're a fan of mushy shrimp and literally everything dripping in butter this is the place for you. And don't get me started on the Cesar salad. I think they get a bonus for using a bottle of dressing in each side salad. Truly such a disgusting meal. The reason I'm not giving them one star is because our waitress was nice and the service was quick."}
{"text":"Excellent service by Will. He was very attentive on a busy night. All the food was great. The 4 course meals are a great option for $16 and include soup salad entre and dessert. The wait was only 5 minutes but I'd recommend calling ahead for busier nights."}
{"text":"Strolled along this eatery with a friend from school some time ago. We didn't come during the Lobsterfest, the endless shrimp deal or with coupons which is what I would usually do now, it wasn't terrible though but the food is more expensive then it should be worth. The waitress gave great service, the free herb biscuits kept on coming! We each had an entree and my friend was telling me how she used to work at a Red Lobster. Yummy splurge~Will try at other locations to see how they are. A seat by the window is lovely plus they also have wine."}
{"text":"Went last night for the shrimp fest. It was my first new and fun experience and so yummy. Service was ok and very strict, not the service I usually get, my friend got fish and chips and did not like the service. I love the ceasar salad! And grilled shrimp was so yummy."}
{"text":"Treated aunt to a belated birthday dinner (three other adults and two children dining; I only had a cocktail and two teensy flakes off of the top of a cheddar biscuit.  BE AWARE that EACH biscuit contains 8 grams of fat, 2.5 grams saturated, and a total of 150 calories.    They ordered *Berry-Mango daiquiris http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/red-lobster-chandler-2?select=d3bUfGn-UZ1bEq99wODlTg#d3bUfGn-UZ1bEq99wODlTg and I a *classic mojito. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/red-lobster-chandler-2?select=iNV2KvaH87Oqi9k_JefLFA#iNV2KvaH87Oqi9k_JefLFA  I heard that the berry-mango was a balanced mixture of fruit flavors, but the alcohol was hardly-detectable.  The alcohol flavor wasn't missed at all, though.  Everyone who had them \"ooh\"ed and \"ahh\"ed.  I wished a simple mango version was available, but I'm also glad it wasn't, or else I would never have found out that RL, or more specifically the bartender working that shift, served a TERRIFIC mojito!  My first sip disappointed, but once I swirled everything a few times with the straw, the drink actually turned out to be one of the best mojitos I've ever had!  It's a classic version, made with Bacardi Superior rum, muddled mint, pure cane sugar (don't like ones made with simple syrup-- too sweet), freshly-squeezed lime juice, and club soda.  I would never be able to dine here (aversion to farm-raised fish, intolerance/allergy to whitefish, shellfish allergies, and Blue Bunny ice cream choices contain corn syrup), but I wouldn't mind enjoying a mojito while everyone else dines!  :)  *Berry-mango daiquiri = 350 calories *Mojito = 190 calories"}
{"text":"Nothing especial.. experience for nothing, food was okay, portion is kinda small.. would I try it again? No"}
{"text":"Very disappointing.  Had to go to Phx for a training and arrived later than expected last night and HUNGRY.  Our hotel was super close to RL and we were excited to get dinner.  I'm not sure if the fact that we arrived at 8pm explains how lacking the food was... or if I'm just trying to find an excuse for RL and how bad the food was.  L and I have been fans of Red Lobster for years.  We don't often get there but when we do, we are all set with our regular order of the popcorn shrimp.  Our server was very quick to get the food out,  which seems like a good thing but was also ready for us to leave ASAP.  I'm a bit confused by this because the restaurant is open until 10 and we left by 9:15.   Back to the food. Generally, I love those warm biscuits that are absolutely terrible for you. Last night, I only had one because it was neither  warm or tasty.  The salad was meh.  The popcorn shrimp was on the cold side and the fries were not terrible but were very salty.  The salty fries may have been my favorite thing and that is just plain sad.  Decided to go all out and have a specialty drink, which was really nothing special.  i ordered the Malibu Hurricane and it sure wasn't anything to excitedly Yelp about!   Red Lobster does an excellent job of tempting you with yummy looking commercials and endless shrimp for $15.99 but the reality doesn't come close to expectations."}
{"text":"Staff is friendly food is good I put three stars because I have been going there a lot only because I have gift cards and need to use them and every tine I was there the bathrooms were dirty like mold around the rims of the sink filthy floors and toilets Once my gift cards are gone I'm done going"}
{"text":"Good place, nice service! I went there to celebrate my birthday and I total loved it!"}
{"text":"I don't eat at RL much, opting for smaller boutique cookeries in lieu of the big chain restaurants, so i was pleasantly surprised last night at my dining experience here. The greeter was friendly, the service was above average and the food, while only a little above average, was nonetheless quite good.  And that's what surprises me. RL has a good business model for a chain and has obviously had years to perfect it.  I couldn't help but compare it to some of the swankier seafood joints in Scottsdale, thinking, \"same quality, half the price\". In these troubled economic times, austerity is king and as such, RL gets my vote."}
{"text":"Some friends of mine have this thing called Fat Fridays!  It's the beginning of a debauched weekend when the diets, workouts, no drinking stops on a dime and are thrown out onto the curb!  So we went to Red Lobster for Fat Friday!  I haven't been to a Red Lobster in like years, so I was kinda tentative about eating here, but the company I knew would be fun so why not!  Yup, indeed, the company was fun.  As far as the food goes...the menu has changed a lot and for the better!  It still has signature Red Lobster fare like all the fried sea food you can think of, served with potatoes cooked in any way imaginable.  But they also had sensible dinners pared with nutritious sides!  I was amazed.  This made for a long time deciding what to get, but I was hungry and had the focus of a lioness on a hunt!  I dictated to the table that we have the lobster pizza for starters!  no one complained out loud but I feel the daggers come out of your eyes! hahaha  I ordered a special dinner called the Hawaiian Isles...four coconut shrimps, salmon with a pineapple teriyaki type sauce, comes with salad, rice, and fries!  Yeah...it's Fat Friday! I also had a Mango Mai Tai that was dangerously delicious! It was gone in a sec...almost got brain freeze.  Our server was the most gracious and attentive server I have had in a chain restaurant, she was wonderful!  My rec...try out Red Lobster again, the food has improved, just be prepared for the lackluster crowd."}
{"text":"First Off , Long wait for Frozen Microwaved Seafood,  Took over a Hour 1/2 to get our Food that was Over Nuked by 300 degrees,  There was no apologies no excuses no sympathy .. never come back to this place again, smells like a soul glow and very greasy restaurant"}
{"text":"Red Lobster in Cow Town... must try...  So went and was a bit disappointed. Well Calgary is known for steak or beef. Came here and ordered the \"Ultimate Feast\". For $32.99 it came with lobster tail, king crab, fried shrimps and butter shrimps and two sides (I chose Cesar salad and lobster cheese baked potatoes). Well for that price it is a really good deal. Only issue with the king crab was that its not that fresh as I hoped it would be. Portion was huge. Kind of embarrassing for a small girl like me to have such a big plate. Plus I did manage to finish it all. My thought about the dish was that it was too much butter. After dinner, I didn't feel to great.   I also got the virgin pina colada with mango topping (the mango topping syrup was too sweet). The glass was big and was very thick. It was good until you got to the bottom where all the syrups where sitting.   For that price I can't really argue. I mean it was a good deal for so much food.   I came here on a Thursday night and the place was super busy. Plenty of parking outside because it was located in a mall (free parking too)."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Red Lobster last night and although there was a long wait, the server, Jerret was fantastic! The service was on point. He made sure to come around enough and filled drinks, brought extra rolls and was very friendly. His area was very busy, yet he managed to stay on top of things. It isn't often that service in this area is outstanding, so kudos to Jerret!!!"}
{"text":"Cheddar bay biscuits, coconut shrimp, Ultimate Feast. Red Lobster is one of my favorite chains. We come for family meals and at least once a year my boyfriend and I challenge each other to see who can eat an entire Ultimate Feast. We're very romantic like that... Although I had to give up my championship first place title when I couldn't finish my deliciously buttery shrimp scampi, I still totally enjoyed the trip. What made it so great is that this location consistently has excellent service and our server Carol was no exception. She was great. She showed us the best most easiest way to eat crab legs, no tools required. I'm always going to remember her everything I crack a crab leg -thumbs on the red side away from you, rock, pull one long piece of tasty crab. The manager also stopped by to check on our meal and was present on the floor throughout our meal. She and her team were great. Everyone from the hostess to the bus boy were friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time yesterday on a Sunday afternoon for Lunch.  The service was good, and the Cheese Biscuits were delicious."}
{"text":"i usually get the Seaport lobster tail and shrimp. really good. 9 out of 10 times i usually get great service. they have outdoor seating although its not very much. nice ambience inside. never that long of a wait. one of the waiters named Luther provides excellent customer service.  great place for the whole family. my 5 year old likes it too so that's a plus."}
{"text":"Well, it's funny how much things change in a year and a half. We decided it had been long enough to try again and we're glad we did. We we're seated immediately, had a great meal and one of the best servers ever. If you have the opportunity stop in and ask for Aleeza, she if absolutely THE BEST server in the area.......great job Red Lobster, thanks"}
{"text":"I was there October 21, 2016 with my 87 yr old mother. Food and service was excellent. My mother needed additional help walking from the restaurant to the car. A Ms. Bailey was a lifesaver as she graciously helped my mom. She went above and beyond service and I was very grateful. This speaks volume on the people Red Lobster hires. PS I feasted like an Admiral."}
{"text":"Hands down thee worst restaurant experience I have ever encountered. My wife and I went there tonight for my 43rd birthday we waited for 45 minutes while I watch several people leave and the the tables just stayed dirty not bussed while we waited. Finally we were sat only not to be greeted by our server. We waited no \"hi\" \"good evening\". \"I'll be right with you\" NOTHING!!  I hear servers cussing saying \"why doesn't she f##'king do it\" I asked the Hostess if they didn't have a busser she replied I'm bussing tables and not even getting tipped out. I will NEVER!!  step foot in that place again. After not being greeted we got up and walked out. I recommend maybe a manager who knows how to run a team. I was a dishwasher, a busser, a server and a manager. My wife is still a restaurant manager and we are people who usually give people who work in the industry the benefit of the doubt, but this place does not deserve it, sorry"}
{"text":"Wow. Dark (I thought they were closed at first), sticky menus with difficult to separate pages, bar chairs all over even though no one was at the bar, and highly over-salted food. I would definitely not go back."}
{"text":"You won't have a problem getting a table... the place is dirty - covered in dust.  The food is disgusting. Service was really slow, too.  We will not be coming back."}
{"text":"We go to this Red Lobster a lot and always get great food and great service. I love the blue cheese dressing and of course, who doesn't love the Cheddar Bay biscuits? The endless shrimp is an amazing value on top of being delish. I highly recommend it for seafood loving families!"}
{"text":"My wife and I come here a few times per year and share a meal. The service is hit or miss but the food is consistently great."}
{"text":"We waited about 15 minutes to be seated.  That's fine considering it was Saturday evening.  However, what was not okay was being seated and walking past at least 10 clean tables with no one sitting there.  Why the long wait?!?! Floor was filthy by us.  The young man bussing tables was using the lil vacuum thing and it wasn't picking up anything.  It just kept rolling the crumbs around our table....smh. Onto the food.  I got the wild sole.  It was delish as usual.   E got the never ending shrimp.  So it started off good.  She immediately took the order for what he wanted next.  Well that's when it ended.  15 minute wait for the next order of shrimp.  He ordered teriyaki and fried.  The fried came out before the teriyaki did and it was ordered first.  The wait time happened twice.  At that point he was just annoyed and said give us the bill.   Overall just an OK day...maybe if we didn't order the never ending shrimp it would've been not as frusturating."}
{"text":"I hadn't eaten at a Red Lobster in over 2 years, so a few friends and I decided to eat here after some shopping at Yorkdale mall.  We called ahead since every other restaurant within Yorkdale had a wait of 30+ mins, they said they were pretty empty and we could just walk in.  The menu seemed to have more options since the last time I went. Our server was very nice, while taking our orders she made sure we knew every option we could order for our choice of salad and choice of side as many of the items on the menu come with both. She even made sure to mention certain sides were an additional charge. I ended up ordering the 7 oz. Sirloin, which does come with a choice of salad, I got caesar, and I upgraded my side to the Creamy Langostino Lobster Mashed Potatoes. The mashed potatoes were SO GOOD and actually had chunks of lobster, shrimp, and melted cheese. The steak was decent as well. You also get unlimited biscuits throughout your time there which is always a bonus. Overall experience was good."}
{"text":"We ate here for our 25th wedding anniversary. We won't be returning anytime soon.  Positives were: Great location Great server Average price Presentation  Clean restaurant   Negatives: I ordered the four course meal-$17.99 Salad-House salad was drenched in dressing and not enough lettuce for it.  Soup- Lobster bisque (you have to pay additional for this choice of soup) Extremely salty- so disappointed because I could only eat a few bites of this due to the taste. Entree- Shrimp Alfredo tasted like it was velveta (but white) melted on it. Horrible tasting flavor which did not taste like any Alfredo sauce that I have ever had. Did not eat this one either:( Dessert- Brownie with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Can't really go wrong with this however the a brownie was just OK. Basically the brownie and ice cream ended up being my dinner for the night."}
{"text":"My mother and I went on a Monday afternoon. Place was more or less dead.   Red Lobster is my favorite chain restaurant (I know! I'm extremely classy). So, I was sad after experiencing the quality of this location. My mother sent back her rainbow trout order. My fried green beans appetizer included a huge glop of uncooked breading that was causing a huge bunch of green beans to stick together. Gross. My mussels were overcooked, chewy, and dried out. Yuck.   Customer service was decent, as our waitress was very nice to us. However, they charged us for the salmon dish (the order my mom placed after the disappointing rainbow trout dish). Granted it was only a $1 more, but most places would have just charged us the cost of the original dish..."}
{"text":"Sydney B. was amazing. She definitely made my family's dinner night especially special by recognizing my husband's homecoming from Afghanistan. The meal was DELISH. Everything was on point. Sydney B. delivered quite a concierge service. I haven't visited Red Lobster in quite awhile and Sydney B. gave a superb performance. Thank you so much for taking the time and effort to get the mangers and other servers out to say \"thank you\" to my husband. You ROCK!!!"}
{"text":"When you are at a chain restaurant, it's all about the service because the food is what it is. The food was good and it was busy. The waitress was always running to and from the table in a frantic hurry and I felt we were just part of a Cattlecall. There was nothing personal about the service despite the fact that it was my daughter's birthday and we had let them know. Furthermore, it's not great when you have to flag the waitress down for silverware and refills that come with attentive service. She seemed to mean well, however she was incredibly busy and our party picked up on the vibe."}
{"text":"Came here on December 27, 2013 we had salmon, king crab legs, and snow crab legs. All the food was hot and steamy which was pretty good considering the place was packed.  Our waitress AVERI was great!  She was extremely accommodating to us and her other tables. I highly reccomend asking to be sat in her section."}
{"text":"Red Lobster is a franchise, so the food was about what you should expect if you ever been to another location. Service was friendly, and they did a good job of accommodating our large group. The location........well, it looks like it used to be alright. Its gotten a little bit ghetto. Not \"stab-town\" status, but definitely not a place that I would want to be wondering about at night. The clientele also fits the neighborhood, so you can expect to see a ton of smoking on the front porch. Overall, we had an enjoyable visit, and although i would return, I don't think this would be my first choice if I were looking for \"casual seafood\"."}
{"text":"Of all the red lobster restaurants this one is the best. Kudos to the manager Anthony for great customer service. And the staff is very polite and fast."}
{"text":"Decided to try something new and was not very happy.  I ordered fried clams and French fries.  Seems pretty simple.  Clams were over cooked and chewy.  Fries were good.  Wife's green beans were very over cooked.  The real problem we had was the biscuits.  We didn't want them.  I'm allergic to them.  Said so.  Our server Amber put them on the table anyway.  Wouldn't take them away.  Server said she \"had to leave them there\".  Seems wasteful and rude.  We asked why and she said the \"manager said she had no choice\".  What's going on at Red Lobster?  Why is the manager forcing stuff on people that don't want it?  Why was she so scared of her boss?"}
{"text":"Don't come to this location with a large party.  They give you two waitresses, management takes one away and the one left is there to fend for herself.  Sherrie did an excellent job trying to pick up the pieces, but mgmt here was so rude and unhelpful.  The kitchen manager belittled someone in our party for complaining when one meal was delivered at a time, beers ordered cane 20 minutes later, and then the manager would never apologize when some of the all you can eat shrimps never got seconds.  If you're going to offer all you can eat shrimp, you better have the kitchen able to handle the extra volume.  Otherwise don't offer it.  Knew there was a reason that Olive Garden sold this brand off."}
{"text":"I had fried shrimp and french fries which were okay. This salad is good as always the biscuits can't be beat. If you do want to try the biscuits at home sam'sclub has a fantastic mix I've tried them and they're worth it"}
{"text":"Wanna Laugh?  My husband and I go here with another couple where everyone proceeds to order THE NEW YORK STRIP STEAK!   I think to my self,why  in the world did we come to Red Lobster for them to eat steak?  I  naturally order fish!  Right?  It only seems right!  Our dinners are served promptly, with a smile.  I look at my shrimp and I look at their steaks, I look back at my shrimp and realize I was the one that ordered incorrectly.   My husband was nice enough to share his perfectly medium rare steak with me. It was as good as any high end steak house.  Moral of the story you ask?  Red Lobster has better steaks then coconut shrimp! Go Figure!!!"}
{"text":"Get the warm chocolate chip lava cake..... Hands down amazing!!  We were a large party and ended up getting seated before a lot of the small parties. It was great becuase we were the large party but it would have kinda of been a bummer had we been a smaller party. Either was it was great for us :)"}
{"text":"Standard Red Lobster. Good food. Wood grilled lobster tail is way better than the steamed version. The bartender made a good long island- heavy on the liquor, which was a surprise because this place is so close to the strip where they make the weakest drinks known to man.  It was way too crowded....15 min wait for a table for two on a weekday.  Clean bathroom, fast service, good server.  Just a bit too close to the strip for me, too many tourists and there was the idiot pimp with his two girls and facial tats in there too...saw a bit more skank upper thigh than I wanted to."}
{"text":"I've been going to this red lobster since I was a child the food has always been very delicious, when I was younger this use to be a nicer part of town but now it's pretty hood but this red lobster has remained well kept this place can get pretty packed on weekends or holidays so you would be better off to make a reservation also stay away from the mall nearby it's not safe nor a pleasant shopping experience. I give red lobster on 75th and Thomas a 4 out of 5 stars the food is great the place is kept clean and well kept the customer service is descent but I would recommend red lobster if your hungry for lobster shrimp or crab their chicken and desserts are also very delicious"}
{"text":"Food is great.. had the harbor lobster bake everything was amazing.   Those biscuits you get are even better. Lol Manager was kind of a ass hole last time we went (we just asked for a both instead)"}
{"text":"I don't usually expect too much from chain restaurants, but my date and I were looking for an early dinner (4:00) after a movie at the Harkins Estrella Falls across the street. Wow! What a great dinner! Stuffed mushroom appetizer, lobster tail, snow crab legs, salad, broccoli, mashed potatoes, top shelf margarita, and draft beer, all for $62. Everything was wonderful. (One minor complaint - the broccoli was lukewarm.) Our server, Lisa, was terrific - personable, but not \"too\" attentive. She mentioned that she'd be leaving her shift soon, and we prepared to give her a tip after our appetizers, but she ended up staying late for us."}
{"text":"We had a super waitress Diane whom step up above and beyond to give super service. Food was great and thank you to all that came over to sing happy birthday for my uncle and mother."}
{"text":"Red Lobsters Biscuits is what drives me to dine at their restaurant. However, now that they sell their brand of biscuits at Costco, I fail to see why I would ever dine here again.   I love seafood. It's my favorite food. However, Red Lobster seems to think that the best way to cook a good seafood dish is to drown it in garlic and butter. My goodness, it's ridiculous how much butter and oil is used in any given dish. I am (was) a huge fan of their Salmon New Orleans. It came with wild rice, broccoli, broiled salmon and shrimp covered in a tabasco butter sauce. I always got the sauce on the side because again, the add too much butter/oil. Since the dish is super easy to make, I decided to make it on my own with less butter. Viola! Dish turned out better than Red Lobster (IMO which is very bias I will admit) For what you pay to get a good meal, the food is very average while being coated in nothing but butter. Even the salads are iffy.   Their food is nothing special. The most decent cooker can make anything on their menu. I never understood why the lines are always out of the damn door when I drive by on a weekend. Convenience? Must be. However, people must REALLY like it considering the wait time on a Friday or Saturday night can be up to a hour.   If I am to leave one positive comment, the service has always been great in my past experience dining here."}
{"text":"We came for the endless shrimp and biscuits, plain and simple. Las Vegas doesn't have too many Red Lobster locations and this was the closet one to the west side. We came on a Saturday night and had a wait of about 30 mins which I suppose wasn't too bad for a weekend. We waited in the super small bar area and grabbed some drinks before dinner.   For dinner we had was the usual - cheddar biscuits, Caesar side salad, breaded shrimp and shrimp scampi. It was all pretty tasty to me and nothing out of the ordinary from a typical Red Lobs visit.   My only reason for a 3 star review would be the service. Our waiter was super slow about checking on us and too busy folding napkins in the corner. Also we didn't get any biscuits until our entrees came out since they were \"in the oven.\" I feel like they should be more prepared with that kind of thing on a Saturday night."}
{"text":"I've been in the restaurant business for years and today was by far the worst service I've ever had. 5-10 minute wait on a Saturday night around 9:45. No biggie. Get sat, and wait another 10 minutes to be greeted. Another 20 minutes for drinks. Our salads and biscuits came out before a strawberry lemonade and a Budweiser bottle. I had to ask for a water to be started with. Really? Employees bickering back and forth loudly, screaming babies (I know that's not the restaurants fault, but just adds to my frustration) floors were littered with garbage. Our server sucked. We're currently still waiting on our food, but the other tables around all had something wrong with their food. If it wasn't for a gift card, we would have walked out.   **update: finally got our food, 45 minutes later. And the server was complaining about the plates being too hot because they sat in the window too long. Anyone else see the irony here?   I'll never come back here again."}
{"text":"The man and I are highly susceptible to any all you can eat deal. And with Red Lobster we thought we could definitely eat our money's worth of shrimp, which we did but the experience wasn't one we would be in a hurry to repeat.   First off when we show up the hostess says she will go clear a table for us. Even though it was later on a weeknight and definitely not busy. She was gone for several minutes while we waited alone and awkwardly out front.  We get to our table and wait quite a long time for our waiter who was friendly when he showed up. He explained the AYCE deal and took our order and disappeared for a bit. When the deal came out my salad, which was ordered with dressing on the side, came without any dressing. He went back to fix it but again was gone for maybe 10 minutes.   We tried several shrimp options. My favorite was the Mediterranean grilled shrimp. The shrimp scampi was super chewy. The coconut shrimp was okay. The Nashville hot shrimp weren't hot. The garlic shrimp skewers were ok. The popcorn shrimp were unappealing with undercooked breading. Eww.   Each smaller serving was served on its own plate and no one bussed any of the plates including the huge platters we were each given to start. It made for a cramped and less than pleasant dining experience.   The food was mediocre, the service slow. With so much competition nearby I doubt I would choose Red Lobster again."}
{"text":"If you live in Scottsdale,this Red lobster is your closest bet.Being a Seafood lover,i find myself craving some crab cakes every now and then especially when those red lobster commercials come on tv. It is no surprise that i just had to try their new seafood trios.so,i ordered some takeout on Mother's Day.   ~Baked lobster Alfredo,panko crusted crab cakes,chimichurri shrimp $15.99 ~shrimp scampi pasta,lemon garlic butter shrimp,parmesan fried shrimp (talk about shrimp overdose) $15.99  We also got the clam chowder for an additional $3,the Caesar salad and a ton of their famous biscuits.The lobster alfredo and parmesan shrimp were just okay,we enjoyed the other dishes. The chowder was nice but the salad was just sad (lettuce,3 croutons yes i counted them and some cheese). Our order was ready on time,the girl was friendly she gladly gave me some extra biscuits.  Overall i like Red lobster,they have a ton of seafood options,the staff is always pleasant and they are very affordable.I know of a lot of fancy restaurants that serve you exactly 3 pieces  of shrimp for $25 (No,thank you).     Cheers!"}
{"text":"I have tried sitting at the bar at a few restaurants lately - mainly because I hate waiting for a table and I think I have found a hidden gem.   Both times I've done this on this trip I have found that the best server is the bartender. I con't recall his name, but he was the best server at a RL I've ever had - how he managed to take care of all the drinks and other customers sitting at the bar eating and drinking and being able to satisfy my need for speedy service is beyond me, but I think the people behind the bar should be paid far more than the incompetent servers out on the floor. I may never eat in the dinning area again!  This place has the same selection as any other RL, but the food seemed fresher, was cooked correctly and was served quickly!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a small meal and had a great experience!!  Rebecca was my server and she was so friendly and accommodating. Opted to have the Seaside Sampler for dinner and it was JUST what I wanted."}
{"text":"The biscuits are amazing! Ordered the snow crab and half were hallow. For a Friday, I do expect slower service but I think the waitress completely forgot about us most of the time."}
{"text":"This was my first time ever going to a Red Lobster, but I thoroughly enjoyed it. The flavor on everything was amazing. I would and will go back. We also had a really attentive and kind server. I also noticed that the rest of the servers were the same way."}
{"text":"We were greeted warmly by the hostess who sat us immediately.  The waiter came by within a few minutes to take our drink order.  That is where I went from a 4 rating to a 3.  My wine was served less that half full.  So, either fill it at least halfway, or get smaller glasses.  Food was good, lots of flavor, waiter was excellent.  But, please change the wine portions."}
{"text":"Amazing service. Garlic crab mushrooms make good appetizer.  Consistent food. Great prices."}
{"text":"Came here during a visit home, home to Lobsterfest (j/k this was actually my first time to red lobster)  I expected Lobster, and Lobster is what I got.  The twin rock and maine lobster tail combo with a side of vegetables and shrimp fett alfredo.  It was a RIDICULOMOUS amount of food, so cheap for the amount (24 bucks if I remember correctly)  No special sauces, seasonings or reductions, just butter, garlic, and salt.  There was also an appetizer of crab stuffed mushrooms which was too oily but still good.  The funny thing about a nationwide chain like this is that it reminds me of how chain food aimed at mass market appeal can be just as satisfying as a single chef run restaurant.  And the rolls are frakkin' amazing!"}
{"text":"My family and I love Red Lobster, We go on date nights here about once a month.  Always ask for Sara she is the Best Waitress and always remembers what we had the last time we where in.  She is So Awesome!"}
{"text":"Sunday was my daughter's 17th birthday and our family was going to meet at Red Lobster to celebrate her birthday. This was to be the third year she choose Red Lobster and we experienced no issues the last few years (which also were over the weekend) calling ahead and letting the restaurant know a large party would be coming and giving them a time. This year we called at 5:30pm to let them know we had a party of 18 and would be arriving at approximately 6:30pm. The young lady who answered the phone said that would be no problem but to call them 30 minutes prior to arrival for them to start preparing tables. I called back at 6pm and a different young lady said they could not seat a party of 18. I explained to her my confusion that we were not told that at 5:30pm and then she said they could seat us but not for at least 2 to 2 1/2 hours. The young lady couldn't explain why I was told something different earlier and was unapologetic. I was very confused and frustrated since we could have made alternate arrangements if were told this 30 minutes prior so I asked to speak with the manager. After a lengthy hold, a lady comes on the phone and says her name is Danielle.  I explained the problem to her and she replies back that they don't take reservations or do call ahead seating. Never does she apologize or offer to see what she could work out to accommodate us and she just came across as annoyed that she was having to take time to speak with me.  By this time I am in my car heading to the restaurant since my guests would be arriving soon since I had been on the phone with the restaurant for some time. I explained my frustration to Danielle and told her I would need her full name, the general manager's name, and their corporate phone number. She said she would need to look up the corporate phone  number and asked if I could hold. I was on hold for over 5 minutes during which the line was picked up 3 different times by young ladies asking if they could help me and I explained each time I was on hold for the manager who was getting me the phone number to corporate. Danielle finally comes back on the line and tells me the number is 1-800-LOBSTER. I really and truly thought for a moment that I was being punked. I mean really, she needed 5 minutes to to know that their number is 1-800-LOBSTER???? I knew then she had been annoyed with me and was just trying to give me a hard time for taking her time. I told her as much and she then said she didn't know the number and she tried to get back on the phone sooner but I wasn't there when she picked up. I had not called back, remained on hold the entire time, and three other ladies picked up on the line just fine while I was on hold which I also explained to her. She then said they had been having phone problems and again, offered zero apologies. I asked when their general manager would be in on Monday and was told he was there and to hold and she would get him. I explained all that had occurred to Jeff, the general manager, who apologized and said he would speak with staff to ensure this didn't happen in the future. It took me almost 20 minutes to arrive to someone who would apologize but never did anyone offer over the phone to see what they could do to make this right. I actually arrived at the restaurant shortly after getting off the phone (call lasted 26 mins) so I could let me guests know what was going on. During the time I was at the restaurant and trying to make alternate arrangements with other nearby restaurants, I asked to speak with Jeff again. I again voiced my total frustration over their mistakes and lack of remorse and my dilemma over what to do. Jeff was of no help other than to again apologize for his employees. We had no issues coming with a large party the last few years and did not have unreasonable expectations over how long it would take to be seated upon arrival (we expected to wait around 30 to 45 upon arrival as we had in previous years when we called ahead). At no point over the phone did anyone offer to break our group apart or see what they could do to seat us."}

{"text":"I wanted to keep my hope alive and tried to stay optimistic about my experience but unfortunately it was every move that caused me to feel terribly let down. The only upside to my experience was the wait was less than they said it would be.   My family and I ate dinner here on Tuesday around 7PM and waited less than 10 minutes for our table. That was the best part of my experience!   Our host sat us but wasn't taking the time to pay attention to us rather he was looking around for clear tables to call in. He tossed the menus on the table and left. Then a server approached us saying our server would be right out. It took our server about 5 minutes to acknowledge us and then said he would be back to take our drink orders. He then disappeared for about 15 minutes and we didn't have any waters or biscuits at our table. At this point the table next to us had already had their drink orders taken and biscuits set down.   It was becoming upsetting that we saw all the servers doing their duties attending to their tables but our server was MIA!! He finally reappeared to take our drink orders and we already knew what we wanted to eat so we ordered as well. He said he would be back with our waters, salads, soups and biscuits. He comes back about 10 minutes later with out waters and plates and said he would be back with our starters. It took him another 5-10 minutes to bring out our starters and never checked on us again. He proceeded to come back after about 15 minutes saying our main course would be out shortly. It took him another 10 minutes for other servers to bring our meal out!! I was at this point furious! Our waters hadn't been refilled, our server never checked on us and he was overall missing most of the time! And it wasn't just our table he was neglecting it was all his tables!   Overall, this experience was a disaster! The service is terrible! I wish a manager had approached my table because they need to know there is a major area needing improvement! Step up your game Red Lobster!   I definitely prefer the Red Lobster on Eastern and Flamingo! They are awesome!"}
{"text":"Great experience overall. I normally don't take the time to write a review about a restaurant BUT this definitely deserved a 5 star rating. Our waiter was the best! He fulfilled all of our needs without us even needing to ask him. Very polite, quick service, and many refills. We made sure to tell the manager before we left that he was awesome. I wish I could remember his name though. The food never disappoints either. The second time I have come to this location and left happy and full."}
{"text":"Ah, Red Lobster, or as we call it, The Palace of Salt and Butter. It's been quite some time since I ate at one, but I had a gift card to use up so now was as good a time as any to go!  This outing was no different food wise from what I remember. The same quality food, although a lot saltier than from what I remember. Also, I feel like for every seafood dish you order half of the content is comprised of butter. Fat is flavor, right? That's the thinking here!  I had the wood grilled lobster, shrimp, and salmon. The seafood itself was cooked nicely and was tender. It came with a salad, baby potatoes, and a side. I went rogue and asked for a corn on the cob instead of your usual sides (Broccoli, various potatoes, zucchini, etc.). The garden salad was alright, an iceberg lettuce concoction with cherry tomatoes and croutons. The potatoes were mealy tasting and the corn was OK. I tried a little of the Admiral's feast which was decent, but The Admiral apparently likes fried clams a little chewy. I tried to eat some snow crab legs but they were super salty (Hmm saltier than the ocean they lived in!) so I could only take a few bites.  Service was excellent. Our server Sunny was warm, friendly, and very accommodating. Our total for 2 large sized seafood dinners and 2 fountain drinks was around $56 with tax.   It's Red Lobster. It is what it is. Even though we live in a desert, there is better seafood out there!"}
{"text":"I'll go when I'm craving seafood... But it's really not good seafood. Everything is in some kind of butter sauce or deep fried. It smells fishy as soon as you walk in the door. The crowd is generally elderly folks and it's just a blah place. Shrimp Fest is the only time worth going... All you can eat for a great price!"}
{"text":"Had an amazing experience from start to finish! Went yesterday for Mother's Day dinner with my two kids and fiancée. Of course it's a Sunday holiday so there was a wait. We were told 15-20 minutes and were sat in 5. My only complaint is that it is obvious that if you have kids under 5, you are ONLY sat in the back by the bathrooms. Seriously there were 4 booths in a row with high chairs and none in the rest of the restaurant. Come on now, just because I have kids doesn't mean I want to smell the restrooms while trying to eat. Gross!     Anyways, our server was awesome and took excellent care of us! She checked on us often and was a total sweetheart! I can't remember her name but next time I go there I will definitely look for her to be our server again!     The food was delicious and came out fast even though the restaurant was busy. I wasn't a fan of the calamari because there is more broccoli and peppers than actual calamari. The crab cakes were awesome! Even my kids are them! I got the snow crab legs and they were good and my fiancée got a salmon/lobster tail/ shrimp plate that he really enjoyed! Overall, great food.   I've been to this location before but this was by far the best trip here and a lot of it had to do with our server! :-) I just hope management sees this and changes the whole \"all kids go to the back\" mentality. I'll make sure next time to ask to sit as far from the restrooms as possible!"}
{"text":"I am not a fan of red lobster, but once a long while we still go there if they have something new like the endless shrimp. So we went and its again a disappointment. Too much butter, too much salt. Dishes are way too salty. Service way okay, not great but acceptable.   That's probably going to be my last time ever visited Red Lobster."}
{"text":"the food is alwsys great...no problem there. I wish I knew how to use this yelp app sooner then I learned. last Aug 20014..my husband and I brought our son there for lunch for his birthday. he lovessss the crablegs!  however our server looked like she wanted to basically kill someone. it felt awkward and she made us feel very unwanted, we are not pain in the a** people at all and we always OVER TIP...  she never once smiled..she never made eye contact...she basically was terrible... he wanted dessert it being his birthday and all, and she brought the check before we cld even ask for it. oh but when we did it was like the end of the world.  I will always continue to come there, but I hope by now this girl is gone. she was just not meant to be a server!!"}
{"text":"It was lobster fest. Need I say more?  The commercials and ads on the radio finally drew us in....  I can think of about 4 other restaurants in the valley I rather eat seafood at but RL remains consistent. The waitress did not underwhelm at all and stayed in constant rotation of our table and kept up with cheddar bay biscuits. For appetizers We ordered the broccoli which tasted like a vegan sushi- soy sauce, crumbles and chili flakes, I ate every bite.  A dozen oysters half shell because we love a seafood splurge and it would be like eating peanut butter with no jelly. Lobster and oysters are a team. The oysters were delicious also but I couldn't stop eating the lobster mashed potatoes.  For main course we split the lobster petite rolls which were amazing!! We spent here times the amount at the main lobster lady a while back and regretted it. The petite rolls were simple, buttery and packed with flavor!  I have never drank a cocktail at RL and it's party because there are no prices on the menu, I cannot stand when restaurants don't include prices on the drink menu, so I stuck with the cranberry ice tea.  Great lunch, great price, full bellies."}
{"text":"I had a $10 gift card for Red Lobster through my Discover Card. This place is a bit of a drive from work, but I figured I'd better use it before it expires.  I got there just after 11am. The place was pretty empty, which worked out because the service I received was exceptional. I went with the Crab and Shrimp Linguine. Along with my garden salad came some biscuits. They were extremely salty. Disappointing. Then came the linguine. That was also pretty salty. Fortunately, my palate mellowed out and I enjoyed the dish overall.  What won me over, or more accurately, what saved them from a borderline 2-star rating, was the service. Everything came out extremely quickly and the servers were very attentive. Halfway through the entrée, the waiter just automatically gave me a to-go box in case I didn't finish. I'm guessing it's because I had asked about the difference between the lunch and full portions. Honestly, I was planning to eat it all, but his gesture saved me from an unnecessarily full stomach and gave me a nice mid-afternoon meal. Not only that, as I was boxing up the pasta, he even offered to give me extra biscuits (I declined of course).  So the verdict? Red Lobster is A-OK. The food was somewhat disappointing, but they made up for it with great service. In fact, I think I was in and out of there in about 20 minutes!"}
{"text":"If you like loud blenders while you try and have a conversation and eat your food near the bar then this is your place.  The booth we were shown still needed to be wiped down and dried off from the excess water on the table.  However, the service was very good and the attention to the customers is better than other restaurants."}
{"text":"Very good I loved my shrimp.  I was in the back with members of Division 28 of CAL-NEV-HA .  Kiwanis is broken down into districts around the world.  Your servers did a good job.  Thank you."}
{"text":"Good food and good service. The staff was very accommodating to our party and helped us celebrate a birthday."}
{"text":"We visited this red lobster on Monday. We had to wait about 40mins to get in but it was well worth the wait. The food was so good! We are from Colorado and none of the red lobster restaurants can touch how good this one is. Everything we got was cooked perfectly. Will be going back for sure."}
{"text":"Every thing is cooked in cheap soy oil. Soy in every thing they serve including the butter has soy in it. How can you lie to your customers and tell them it's butter when it's not. Butter comes from a cow not a poisonous soy bean. Cheap ingredients with expensive prices but what else would you expect from a Dardins chain restaurant! I would give no stars if that was a option."}
{"text":"Went to Red Lobster on a Thursday night. When we got there it was not too busy so we got a table right away. The server was very friendly and explained to us the specials and new items on the menu. We ordered and while waiting for our food he brought us biscuits. Weird thing is there was a piece of ice in the basket with the biscuits. ???  It did not take too long for the food to arrive. I had lobster tail and two kinds of shrimp with rice and green beans for the side. The food tasted good but there was not much rice and I found it a bit hard. My wife had the salmon, lobster tail and shrimp. The lobster tail had been buttered while cooking and my wife found it salty. However her salmon was delicious. Her side was a kind of mashed sweet potato with walnuts which was a bit too sweet. In the end, the price was a bit high, but this is lobster. It had been several years since we went there and will probably wait few more years before going again."}
{"text":"Tried their new crab fest plate. Not much crab (skinny), no utensils to get at the crab other than a pair of pliers (no crab fork). Lousy service. Everything on the plate was covered in greasy sauce. Only thing still good there are the biscuits, but we only had one shot at them."}
{"text":"As a rule I generally try to avoid chain restaurants and I generally only frequent Red Lobster during AYCE shrimp. But one night (a Sunday night) my husband and I were out walking just looking for a place close by to eat, and we succumbed to our desire for Red Lobster (it had been a few years). It was Shrimpfest. Not AYCE but we figured this would do.   Looking in from outside (and given the time - 9:00pm) we figured there would be no problem getting a table for two. We waited about 5-10 minutes for a table, not bad for Red Lobster.  The food was as we expected it to be. We had a pleasant time here. Because we were in no rush we didn't let the exuberantly slow service bother us too much. Our waiter was VERY apologetic at the end of our meal explaining that he was given our table even though it was outside his section, which we figured, since he was rarely around for us to catch his attention when need be. He thanked us for our patience and then asked where we were from. He was shocked to learn that we were from Toronto, and then said he has never served such polite Torontonians! Compliment?! I'll take it. What does that say about Torontonians though? Are we rude? Whatever, as I said, I'll take the compliment. I just hope the next time I'm there the service is a bit faster."}
{"text":"Yesterday, September 19th, I decided to go and eat lunch at Red Lobster. I knew I would have a delicious lunch, but I never knew I would meet one of the few \"beautiful\" people I've ever seen.  I was quickly escorted to my seat and was asked what I wanted to drink.  Within a few minutes, my drink was brought to me by the most beautiful young man I have ever seen.  Talk about one way for a restaurant to get more business, just hire guys that look like this.  He was so charming and could have been a model.  He came to my table and took my order with a huge smile on his face.  This guy was tall, dark, handsome and charming.  He had the curliest dark hair a slight beard, gorgeous eyes and a smile for every moment.  He was so kind and considerate.  I finally put my order in and I received it in a proper amount of time.  The food was delicious and before I was finished, my beautiful waiter came by and asked how the cocktail sauce was, since I had not eaten any of it, so I told him I had some health problems and had to watch what I ate.  He was very understanding.  At the end of the meal and after I had paid the bill, he came to my table with that smile and held his hand out to me.  Now, I thought he was just being charming and wanted to shake my hand, so I shook his hand and said it was nice meeting him and he was so charming, BUT, as I sat watching television last night, I realized he was probably going to help me get up.  Since I've been married for 38 years and never have had that kind of treatment, I really feel stupid now.  Anyway,  I highly suggest this Red Lobster.  Not only because of this gorgeous young man, who did not have on a wedding ring for you single ladies and was probably in his late 20s or early 30s, but for the food and restaurant itself."}
{"text":"This place is bad. My prediction is that this chain/company will close down in a year or two.   Firth however what is with the 'Korean' trend? They have added Korean flavour at Red Lobster! Subway is advertising a Korean Sub. The poutine places in town are serving Korean flavour poutine etc etc. I guess Korean cuisine or flavour is the new ramen/izakaya/sushi/$15 hamburger/etc. (the etc. is too old for me to remember or have been alive).  Anyway, back to Red Lobster. They definitely have TV dinner/aeroplane style trays of food that they microwave and serve. The food arrives with the sauce half hot and the other half cold. Speaking of which the trick is to douse the whole thing in as much sauce as possible. The sauce is either full of MSG or salt and should be as unhealthy as listening to Donald Trump's conservative racist rubbish for an hour (OK maybe Trump is worse). This sauce must have as much calorie as I need to eat for a week.  The décor is passe or old-style chic depending on your tastes, the drinks are big and if you like to eat Korean food I can point you to a restaurant (or ten) within a ten-minute walking radius."}
{"text":"I haven't had Red Lobster since my first year in college. I learned there are more awesome restaurants out there than to pay $30+ dollar on entrees in a chain restaurant especially in the city. Perhaps the rest of the America is learning too which explains why Red Lobster is closing its door soon.   After hearing the news that Red Lobster might be no more in the near future, we decided the cheddar by biscuits were enough to worth one last visit. We arrived around 9PM and although the restaurant was half empty, the manager came to the hostess and specifically requested her to make our party wait because the kitchen was backed up. So our party waited by the freezing entrance for a good 15 mins - not quite sure why they couldn't just seat us and perhaps allow us to order drinks. And when it was finally our turn  -  although my soon mother in law was in crutches hopping through the dining room and there were many available same size tables towards the front , they decided to seat us far into the back corner. (On management alone, no wonder they are closing.)   The working environment seemed quite hostile. Our table could hear workers bickering over who should get which table and manager talking down to the servers. Our poor server seemed extremely anxious/nervous. From explaining the specials to pouring our water, he seemed very fidget-y.    4 of the party went with the $18 four course special (soup choices of clam chowder, broccoli + cheese, minestrone, house/Caesar salad, the Habenaro fried shrimp, 2 shrimp + scallop linguine, and chicken in mushroom sauce,  dessert - 2 caramel cheese cake, (traded the last 2 desserts for 1 molten cookie a la mode), and an added side of snow crab legs. I love my share of seafood so I went with the fire grilled seafood entree (lobster tail, garlic shrimp, and scallop).   Our basket of warm, buttery, fluffy biscuits was served soon after. They were much better than I last recalled (more herb, less salt)... And that was basically the highlight of our meal. Soups- the clam chowder and tortilla chicken were overly salted. The cheese and broccoli looked much more like a dip. Salad - thank goodness I asked for my dressing on the side, everyone else was drenched.  Entrees - should come with a warning of hypertension - what? there are other seasonings aside from salt? someone should inform the chef. $30 dollar seafood entree, I was only able to eat the roasted veggie medley, steamed broccoli, and 2 scallops. None of us could even stomach the lobster tail. Desserts -  my fiance and his brother shared the molten cookie but were quickly sweetened out. The cheesecake was your generic store bought cake. Overall a very disappointing meal.   I guess I didn't miss out much the last 7 years; there are many many much better seafood restaurants out there. Also, I recently learned that you can actually buy the cheddar bay biscuit mix from the grocery store! Now I definitely don't see why anyone would want to dine in Red Lobster. Food? service? ambiance? it offers none of the above."}
{"text":"what a fucking joke? my waitor is nice but there is no excuse to not get fries in a kids meal! never coming again! fuck you red lobster And look at this fruit they gave me, who took a shit on my meal! Thomas Spencer you are going DOWN!"}
{"text":"We come here often and I always forget to write a review! I have never been disappointed. The food is delicious and fresh, the servers are so nice and professional and it's always clean.  I always get the center cut strip with mashed potatoes and corn on the cob- it's perfection!  Some of our favorites include: the ultimate feast, clam chowder soup, their Caesar salad - honestly this list can go on!"}
{"text":"Dining in Red Lobster is dining in my comfort zone. Going back to 1977, I have been a Red Lobster fan. In my early forties, I continue to be a Red Lobster fan. In 35 years I never got tired of it. So, it is with little surprise that when we visited Phoenix that we would dine in a Red Lobster.     For whatever reason, the Cactus Road Red Lobster (near Paradise Valley Mall) was dead on a Friday night. It was the first time in a while that when I visited a Red Lobster that a wait to be seated was nonexistent. If there was a wait, I'm sure that the usual lobster tank would have occupied me for a few minutes.  As soon as I saw the \"All You Can Eat Shrimp special\" on the menu, I was decided. The shrimp special is no joke. There is a choice of four shrimps including shrimp scampi, fried shrimp, and shrimp with linguini. I'll be the first to admit that Red Lobster seafood isn't Wolfgang Puck Gang quality at the same time that I'll admit that it is far better than frozen foods seafood or a burger served in a casual restaurant chain. It wasn't just the all you can eat shrimp and bottomless soda that makes this a good deal for approximately $20. It was also the salad with dressing and house bread.    Red Lobster's menu features many entrees that are affordable. I just happened to hit Red Lobster when they featured the \"All You Can Eat Shrimp.\" If it had been another time of the year, I would have ordered shrimp linguini, which comes with a salad and bread.    I had zero complaints about the service. Our Waitress was prompt with the refills at the exact time that she did not rush us.   Dining in Red Lobster is dining in my comfort zone. As long as I am living and have some green in my pocket, I will return to a Red Lobster throughout the year."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to dine at Red Lobster this past week. We were ready for some seafood and thought it would be the place to go. I should have realized we were in trouble when we saw that they were not busy! We both ordered grilled and steamed seafood dishes with salad & vegetables. First the salad was brought to our table and the bowl had about 5-6 pieces of lettuce and two tiny pieces of tomato and cucumber-are you serious? It was less than mediocre! Then our main dishes came and the seafood was horrible. My scallops smelled funny and tasted bad. I bit into my shrimp and they were very mealy and had no real flavor. The grilled Lobster tail was ok-it's hard to ruin. My husband had to send his white fish back-it tasted horrible & they brought him grilled shrimp-same bad taste! Our only positive thing was our server. We asked to speak to the manager and they said they would be right over. After 15 minutes of waiting we got up & left. Don't waste your time or money at this place!!!"}
{"text":"First, let me say that our server, Amanda, was the BEST.  She was pleasant and efficient and gets totally high marks.  The food is \"OK\" - nothing to go crazy over (except the biscuits - isn't that the highlight of every entrée there?).  But I absolutely hate that the restaurant-teaching gurus think it's a good practice for the hostesses to ask their patrons \"how their day's been going\" as they seat them.  Every patron KNOWS that they've been told to do this.  And it's annoying.  How will they respond if someone tells them that their hemorrhoids have been flaring up?  Of course, most people won't be so candid and will say \"fine\", just like when the manager comes around to every table and asks if your meal is tasting wonderful (which he DID).  No, it's just \"OK\".  In fact, my baked potato was super dry, even WITH the extra butter that I requested, but I'm not going to share that information.  I just want to eat undisturbed.  If there's something wrong with my meal, I'll relay to my server.  Isn't that what they're THERE for?  I'm SOOOO not impressed when the managers come around to the tables.  We all know that's just something taught in \"restaurant\" school that has become the trend during the last 10 years or so.  NOT NEEDED.  Let your patrons eat in peace!  And lastly, PLEASE tell your tall, curly-haired female server (not Amanda!) NOT to refer to her female customer as \"darlin'\"!  I almost CRINGED.  And her customer was about 20 years OLDER than her!  Yikes, that was awkward."}
{"text":"7/24/16 - PARTY OF 35+. Came here to eat in honor and memory of my late Grandpa. We had a waiter and a waitress. They did a stellar job. Communicated with us and each other very well. Made sure everyone was satisfied, kept us filled on drinks. The food was top notch and evenly distributed with the appetizers.   Service was just fantastic and there were absolutely no complaints. They definitely earned their tip today. They were literally back and forth for the duration we were there.   I ordered the Salmon New Orleans. Very rarely do I order fish, but I'm glad I did, because it was delicious to the last bite. Thank you Red Lobster Staff and Management for making this a positive and memorable experience for our family and friends. Hats off to you!   * Aside from the food and service, the Restrooms were very clean and kept up. You can tell they take great pride in their Restaurant, it shows on all levels.    [Reader: Please add me as a friend!]"}
{"text":"Cluster ESPECIALLY during AYCE shrimp.  They are slow at times and they are understaffed."}
{"text":"I don't know what is wrong with me! I mean, I gave a five star to a fast food restaurant, and now I am happily giving five solid stars to a chain most roll their eyes at. Well, maybe you all shouldn't. My better 2/3'rds . had a moment, wanted seafood, he suggested Red Lobster, I laughed, then got on their website and said \"I am in!!\" (it has been several years for either of us to patronize one). We walked in, were greeted, and there was a line of people at the hostess desk almost leaking out the front door like a civ (good sign?).  Geez, we didn't care, we sat at the bar, as we do everywhere we go. So off to the bar we went went. We had an amazing bartender, the best warm, fresh biscuits were promptly brought out by him and our drinks were first thing when we sat down, we are off to a great start. I had a shrimps cocktail, it was honestly, just as good as any fine steak house or seafood establishment you can find. Boyfriend got the lobster pizza. This thing was so good he sorta inhaled it but gave me a slice and it was awesome!  Loaded with tons of lobster and langostines and tasty pesto, very thin crust, super good. The drinks were spot on, the service was excellent, the food was great and there was two elderly gentleman at the bar, they each ordered a bloody Mary with an up huge whiskey glass for their back, it was awesome and their conversations were hilarious :) Our bill was only $38.00. Can't beat that any day. We are a $50.00 minimum regardless couple and we left happy, full and still had monies in our pockets. High five and five stars to Red Lobster and the great service, clean establishment and great food."}
{"text":"Tonight, the hostess was very nice and personable. Sydney, our server was awesome! She was really kind and laughed at all of my boyfriends jokes (even when he wasn't funny). She was really on top  everything from re-filling our water, pre-bussing, ordering the next round of endless shrimp, ect.. Although, it was the end of the night she never made us feel rushed. We were extremely pleased with our service tonight on top of a good dinner."}
{"text":": 1304 38568 6297 - Looking forward to dinner, as usually I am very happy and love the food and service.  I decided since I was alone, I would sit at the bar.  The bartender (shown as Madi ono the reciept, was very nice and let me know she'd be right with me.  A short time later, she appeared and I ordered, water and Lobster Lovers Dream, somewhat at her recommendation.  Came with salad and a couple biscuits.  All was going well, eating my salad and then, a cockroach came from behind the bar right towards me.  I stopped eating and attempted to flag the bartender down, it took a little bit.  In that time, I watched the cockroach crawl in my dressing cup and around my food. (I was now standing up to keep a good eye on him)  Well, I told her that he was crawling down the bar now and she instantly said, let me get the manager.  Ok, well her she comes (I did not catch her name) and asked what the problem was.  At this point, I tossed my napkin on the roach, trying to stop him from going anywhere else.  Unsuccsessful.   She asked if they need to replace anything.  I had eaten about 1/2 of my salad and a buscuit and decided I didn't need another salad.  I was pretty calm and tried not to make a big issue about it.  She apologized took my salad and buscuit, wiped down my eating area and filled my water.  A couple minutes later, here comes my food.  While I ate, the manager and bartender asked how everything was, good, and they both filled my water, probably 2 times each.  When Iwas done, i pushed my plate up, bartender asked if I wanted dessert.  No thank you, I'm good.   Here is the problem, I got the check.... FULL PRICE I was charged and the upcharge for the asparagus.  That's $35.99 + $2.49.    I sat for a bit, trying to figure out what, if anything I wanted to say.  I took a picture of my reciept as I was in awe.  I told Madi, I believe this isn't your decision, but I can't believe you want me to pay full price after what happened.   She offered to go get the manager to handle it.  I said she shoudl've already handled it as she was out here 2 times asking how I was and filling my water.  On her 3rd time over to fill my water, I declined and figured she would make things right at that moment, but nothing.  I told Madi I would not be coming back and thanked her.  I may only be 1 person, but probably no longer a Red Lobster customer."}
{"text":"There were four of us for lunch.  Normally we're all big fans of Red Lobster but such wasn't the case this time.  To begin with we were pretty sure our waiter was fairly new.  Not that there is anything wrong with being new because we've all been new on the job at one time or other.  It's just he didn't really know the menu, he kept coming back with questions and the list went on.  After asking for ketchup and then for butter we had to go get those ourselves from other waiters or our food would have been cold.  One person at the table had lunch from the lobsterfest menu.  He wasn't pleased at all and thought it not very tasty.  Coconut shrimp is always to die for and as usual it was delicious.  Sailor's plate was sparse, garlic shrimp was good but flounder fishy.    Overall, we were a little disappointed with our lunch this time and definitely have experienced better from other Red Lobster restaurants."}
{"text":"Fantastic!  Perfect!  That's the way to describe our meal at this Red Lobster.    There were four of us and it was an early dinner.  We were lucky enough to be served by Matthew.  A server can make or break your meal and this one made it great.  The shrimp, cole slaw, green salad and scallops were cooked perfectly. Of course, the cheddar biscuits were also hot and delicious.  Great meal!  Great server!  It doesn't get any better than this."}
{"text":"We stopped for another feast of the \"all you can eat shrimp special\".  We love this time of year when we can pig out on shrimp cooked several different ways.  We weren't disappointed from coconut shrimp to shrimp alfredo to garlic scampi, it was all delicious.  To top it off, we had a fabulous waiter.  Peter was so friendly and so efficient.  He made our whole experience there super.  It was definitely an A+ night."}
{"text":"2.5 stars ...   waitress was brilliantly awesome! i loved her. the best ever. polite, courteous, knew exactly what you wanted and a sweetheart. ( just was gd at keeping us up to date, knew how to make our meal right, and on the house awesomeness)  ordered the 30$ special for two ppl - includes one appetizer or dessert + 2 entrees.  everything was doused in buuuuutter goodness. if that's the way you like it, you won't think this place isn't so bad.  personally didn't like it here (and hence the two and half stars for the amazing service)  seafood linguine pasta - full of butter - was delicious and flavourful, but full of oil? butter???  just lots of it!!    lobster bisque soup - free on the house (due to ordering salmon entree that was on a shortage ) - soup was AWFUL, just FULL of saltiness, taste canned or worse.  cake - on the house - did not enjoy - got the cookie lava cake thing - blech, taste like kinda boxed crap.  scone biscuits were delicious! but not amazing since i knew it was the garlic butter and saltiness just fooling my tastebuds.  appetizer - chicken bites - this was probably the best for me - was extremely tender, deep fried exterior and the dip placed on the side as recommended by waitress - b/c damn that was some hot sauce).   caeser salad (each person gets one) - delicious - though nothing spectacular - bacon bits were mehhh    overall, would not return though was an amazing deal - for two ppl - 30$. and was extremely filling (got takeout)"}
{"text":"I am not a huge Sea Food lover, but from time to time I like to get me some shrimp! I don't get all crazy with Lobster or Crab...... shrimp is where its at for me! The reason I love Red Lobster (because I get the same dish every time I go) is for their delicious Shrimp Linguine! If I am in the mood for sea food alfredo Red Lobster is where im at. The shrimp is always tasty (rarely ever fishy tasting) the linguine is perfectly al dente and the alfredo sauce is del to the ishious! Red Lobster is also known for their Cheddar Bay biscuits! Sweet mama I will eat 12 of these in one sitting, if my stomach permits it. The combination of the biscuits and their delicious fresh salads are a perfect start to your meal!  This particular Red Lobster is always a pleasure to visit. We come here maybe once a month maybe more for the location and the service. Not once have I been disappointed with the food or the service. The wait of course for Friday or Saturday night dinner is pretty long, but that is to be expected. For a chain restaurant I have to say they have their game face on, for I will visit any chain in any state to get me some scrumptious Shrimp Alfredo!   Keep it up Red Lobster and this Shrimp Lover will be back for your annual Shrimp Lover Months!!!"}
{"text":"Our son has this tendency to get things in his head and he will not let them go. I think he gets it from his mother. Regardless, in this case he decided that he had to go to the Red Lobster. So we decided to take him for his birthday.  Thinking ahead, we showed up at 4:30 on a Saturday, just knowing that we would beat the dinner rush. Unfortunately, everyone else appeared to have the same plan. So we were told it would be a 20-minute wait. Unfortunately that turned into something more like 35 minutes. But it wasn't horrible, since it was a nice day, and the staff was generally good about updating us on the status of the table.  Unfortunately, since there were five of us, and a very large party arrived just in front of us, encompassing multiple tables and the setup of this location not conducive to larger parties, it meant the only option even at that time was for us to sit at a booth for four with a chair at the end. It was cramped to say the least, and then that was made worse by the fact that we were placed in the traffic lane between the tables of the aforementioned large party. We asked to move, and were given another table that had just been cleared. Clear sailing ahead. Or not.  Just as we were settling into this new table - now just over an hour after we arrived - a lady approached us, in a relatively nice manner, and asked us to move to yet another table. Please know that it isn't that we had a problem with any particular table, but that we had already been there for an hour, we had been seated and moved once already and initially been told that it would be only 20 minutes.  Then we found out that the lady who asked us to move this last time was actually one of the people in the large party that was taking up all the large booths so that we couldn't be seated, and perhaps most importantly, the staff milling about just allowed her to do so.  So we left. On the way out, the manager-type person apologized, and she was nice about it, but sometimes enough is enough."}
{"text":"I just don't think that Red Lobster is in my wheelhouse. It used to be that they were the go-to place, but that has been in different cities. To their credit, this location is much, much friendlier and more intimate than the one on Independence in Matthews. But it's still the same place.  Though it's a largish restaurant on the inside, there are mostly tables for two and four  - if you take a group in, you're going to have to wait. And probably wait some more. Probably best to go with a smaller party.  The service here is also a step (or several) above that in Matthews. The food could be the same, or several, above - since we were never even served in Matthews, it's tough to say. They did a fine job here, just know what you're getting into and you'll do fine.  Once the place was made over, it came out of the 80s vibe that had haunted them and updated it well enough, and the menu selections aren't bad - but getting seafood in Charlotte is definitely hit-or-miss. You may just want to save that for a trip to the beach."}
{"text":"Family of 4 turned out to $100 bill.  Just not worth it.  Everything was ok.  Average chain food.  Enjoyed Red Lobster years ago but probably won't return.  Lots of better choices to feed a family of 4 for $50."}
{"text":"Darden Restaurants, if you want to know why your chain is slipping put upper management on the next flight to McCarran and pay this location a visit. 2 visits, 1 week apart, 3 people the first visit, 5 on the second. And all of us including my 2 year old think you suck donkey balls. Let's explain why.   It all starts with SERVICE. I don't mind waiting but first come, first serve is the way it works. When the hostess knows someone and gets them seated before you, not cool. My money is just as good as theirs. Next up, no my 2 year old doesn't want the lobster dog and pony show with you reaching into the big tank by the front door to show him one. He doesn't do lobster, he does mac & cheese, and you suck at that which I'll cover in a second. Then I'd like to sit at a different table for once. 5 visits in 90 days, same table 4 out of 5 visits. Then when we're seated come over and give us a menu. Take a drink order. Bring some biscuits. Don't stall for 10 min while you go talk to someone else, or go stare out the window or dream of the bong you're going to hit after work. Get moving!  Furthermore, I know RL is not cheap despite all that crappy cattle call advertising you're doing of late. I want tiny shrimp on my salad, I want that big plate, I don't mind dropping good money on it. Don't try and steer me towards a plate I don't want that costs less, I know what I want. It's why I walked in the door. And then when you finally take my order don't forget about us. Send a tea refill around once in awhile, we're in a desert you know, we're thirsty and willing to pay to quench our thirst.   And then when the food arrives, that is not the time to spring THE SURVEY OF DOOM on me. \"OMG, like we're doing this big survey thingee, and if you do it I get extra bong money, and if you don't I'm gonna get wrote up or fired\"...how about shut the heck up and let me eat and don't spring the SURVEY OF DOOM on me until you bring my check? I don't want to be trying to eat a crab leg or coconut shrimp thinking that if I don't fill out the survey you're going to be out of a job. Not cool, at all.   Then when we get through eating, how about clearing the table, and not bringing up the survey again? And as you pick up my son's plate notice something. He's two. Two year olds like mac & cheese for the most part. My 2 year old will even eat my feeble attempts to make mac & cheese, but he spits out the crap you called mac & cheese and put on his plate. When my 2 year old thinks you suck, you suck. Simple as that.   Last but not least I don't mind you asking about dessert, you got to try and do the upsale and I get that. But don't spring the survey on me again and just give me my check without the dramatics. And finally, one last time no my son doesn't want to see your damn lobsters. Keep your hands off my child and let us walk out the door without feeling like we just had to go through the entire front line of an NFL team just to get to the exit.   2 Stars. Coconut shrimp and crap legs cover for a multitude of sins, emotional distress, and the feeling of being mugged, especially when you get the bill and realize how much you dropped for a mediocre at best experience."}
{"text":"I took my Mother in law and Sister in law to dinner here. And we had a great time. Our server was having her first night there. \"Dienna\" was wonderful and so cheerful -I wish I remembered her trainers name- He was awesome!!  Our drinks were quickly brought to us. And we were told the specials. We had a wonderful meal and our hosts were very attentive. When I got back to NC again I will be sure to stop in. I hope the Manager takes good care of these young folks."}
{"text":"Service can be hit or miss. Sometimes it's great and sometimes it sucks. Overall the food is pretty good. Rice pilaf can sometimes be dry. Clam chowder is good! Alfredo can also be dry depending on how much sauce you get. Overall, it's an ok experience."}
{"text":"Came here one day to celebrate a friend's birthday. We got sat right away. Our server was nice but the service was slowwwwwwwwwwwwww. It took forever to even order drinks. We finally ordered our food. I got the clam chowder soup and it was super greasy. We asked for extra tartar sauce with our food and never got it. Not the best place to celebrate someone's birthday in my opinion."}
{"text":"Im here for lunch and the new bartender sucks! her name is sherry and she was absolutely rude to me! i didnt like my drink she made and she basically told me to eff off... ive worked in the restaurant business for many years and know that shes never worked in a restaurant before! And i seriously just finished my meal  and she asks if im ready for dessert....shes just horrible.... she asks if i want some more biscuits and im thinkinf about it for a min and say no thank you and she says \"oh hahah took you a long time.\""}
{"text":"After my trip to Hawaii I was craving fish.  My mom and I decided to go to Red Lobster, haven't been to one in forever.  It was dinner time and the place was busy.    Yes, they still have the awsome biscuits and their food is good.  But here is the reason for this review.  They are doing something right at the Metro Center location, we had the best service ever.    The waiter was prompt and even indicated that anyone in the area can help if he isn't there right when we need him.  He refilled our drinks, was very attentive and professional.  The manager came over to see how are meal was and actually asked in a way that made it clear she cared (sounds kinda sappy, but usually when managers ask at other places it doesn't ring sincere a lot of time)  She even took some of our plates away with her.    Very impressed with the service.  Good job Metro Center Red Lobster!"}
{"text":"I am so, so disappointed by my most recent experience at Red Lobster. I had a friend come in from out of town, and she wanted to try Red Lobster (not a restaurant they have in her hometown). We went on a Saturday evening, and it was surprisingly empty, but when we asked to be seated in a booth, were rudely told that \"booths are reserved for larger parties of 4 or more\" - lie, because I've definitely sat in their booths before with a party of 2, and even more, there were groups of two sitting in booths around us? If it was a busy time I'd understand, but about 70% of the restaurant was empty, so I'm not too sure what was happening there.   We decided to order the Admiral's Feast and the Seaport Lobster and Shrimp. What a disappointment. The Feast was so greasy almost everything was soggy, and when we moved the food to our side plates there was a large puddle of oil left on the plate. While tasty, we got slightly nauseous after eating only a few clams because it was like biting into solid oil. The Seaport Lobster and Shrimp was extremely underwhelming. Again, very tasty, but the portion was so small it just didn't feel worth it.  I'm upset because I was really hoping to give my friend a great experience by trying out restaurants she's never been before, but I'm afraid after this experience she may never visit a Red Lobster ever again. The only upside to our visit was our friendly waiter, who I believe was new, but worked very hard to make sure we had everything we needed."}
{"text":"Vanessa was our server and she was good, she filled our waters as soon as they were below half full. However I asked for light ice on one of the waters and the 2 that were served had no ice. I didn't mind, but my boyfriend did. Anyways we didn't complain.   The steak I had ordered was ok, there wasn't much flavor. I'm not sure I'll order that again as it is known for seafood and not steak."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been coming to this location since we moved to Paradise Valley in 1988 (30 years).  There a couple of servers that have been working here at least that long.  I was really surprised to read some of the really poor reviews about service and high prices. We enjoy it here because we think the food is great, consistantly, and so is the service...in my opinion if course.  We still love it and are here tonight, again, celebrating the years and we will be back. Thank you for reading."}
{"text":"I never give high scores but our waiter Eric was fantastic request his section. Kept our drinks full, food hot came out in a timely manner. M"}
{"text":"It was okay, nothing fabulous by any means.  I ordered the grilled salmon - pretty good. Definitely not the best I've had, but certainly not bad by any means. Waitress was very attentive and a sweet lady. I've heard several people rave about the biscuits... I actually thought they were horrible. They had a garlic-y taste to them, and it failed miserably for me. No thanks...  Honestly, there's nothing really wrong with this place. I just think the food is way overpriced. It's good, but not $30 per person good. If I'm going to pay that kind of money, it better blow me away. And it did not."}
{"text":"Stopped in today for the lobster roll and I got something better. Not sure, but I think my bartender's name was Mary. She recommended to double the meat and make it a combo. It was awesome. The up change for dbl was under four bucks. Totally recommended that and the bartender."}
{"text":"Excellent food..great service and attention ! We ALWAYS set at the bar to have dinner.. All of your needs are quickly met,and bartenders seem to be more upbeat, and happy !!"}
{"text":"Yummy food , friendly service and good prices. Every time we are treated nicely,  the food tastes really good , very generous portions and their kid menu is phenomenal! Not a restaurant  I would go for date night but definitely a family friendly place to have a tasty affordable meal!"}
{"text":"I'm a little biased in that I've always loved seafood regardless of where it's come from.  But for me some of the best coconut shrimp I've had came from my times going to Red Lobster!  This place really makes you feel comfortable with nice seating areas scattered throughout the restaurant and attentive service.  Even though I've only been a few times, it's one of the best and tastiest selections I've ever had!"}
{"text":"A friend and I were meeting for dinner. She asked if we could meet at Red Lobster. I had not been there in awhile so I agreed to meet there. It was 5pm on a Tuesday night so we were able to get right in with no wait. Most of the time there is a line and a waiting period to get a table.  They were having a Crab Feast as their special for the month. My friend and I got the same thing-crab legs and scallops. We also both got potatoes. I got a baked potato and she got mashed but hers had a crab sauce on top.  When the food arrived it looked really good. The scallops were grilled and cooked perfectly. The crab legs were also done nicely. Sometimes you go to places and the crab legs are soft and too pliable. The crab crackers can't even break them open. These had crisp shells that cracked nicely.  Our server was very kind and she was very attentive. If you haven't been into Red Lobster in awhile you should check them out. You know you can't resist those cheddar biscuits."}
{"text":"You see commercials on tv all of the time for Red Lobster. The commercials make you want to go eat there immediately. In fact when you do go there is almost always a wait. They definitely keep busy. Currently they are running an endless shrimp special. You can choose from fried, Mediterranean, hot (spicy) fried, scampi, popcorn, or Alfredo.  When we went on a week night around 8pm we had to wait for 30 minutes.  We were seated but it took a bit for our server to come and take our drink order. We decided to go ahead and order when our server brought our drinks. We both ordered the Endless Shrimp. I got the Scampi and the fried along with a salad and a baked potato. Both types of the shrimp were barely warm. That was surprising because the food came out very slowly.  The fried shrimp was crunchy but didn't have a lot of flavor. The Scampi has a nice garlic taste but could have used a fresh squeeze of lemon. I also ordered the Mediterranean shrimp. It was on a skewer but the sauce on it was watery and didn't have flavor. My salad was way overdressed and I could only eat about half. My baked potato, on the other hand, has very little sour cream or bacon.  We walked out full but lacking a lot of flavor. Next time we won't be so quick to react to their advertising. We will walk, not run to get there."}
{"text":"I had a decent time at the bar. Service was good, food was on par with any other Red Lobster."}
{"text":"My pasta was full of grease!!! The food came quick but I give them a F in presentation. The best part of my meal was the triple berry sangria... The Manager Brandon was fantastic and our server (Sarah) was great as well"}
{"text":"I liked my usual pasta and the rolls smelled good... even the Caesar salad looked great... but the service was awful. She greeted us after a decently long wait. Which I understanmd if its a busy night but this was a Sunday and it was pretty slow. Not a holiday Sunday just a random Sunday. Then we were rushed through. Literally the salad came right out then the bread right after - we didn't even pick up forks yet which is fine... I am pretty sure the bread is supposed to be first but that doesn't matter much... bread and salad I am a happy camper. I was assuming it was quick because she knew she made us wait so long... but then the pasta in less than 5 minutes. I literally had taken 2 bites of my salad and not even grabbed a biscuit yet! So what should we do let the pasta get cold and eat our salad and bread or eat the pasta while it is warm and chuck the salad up as a loss? Also my water was empty almost the entire time then when she brought the check she asked if I wanted a refill.. would have been nice earlier... overall we had an entire dining experience that should have been a relaxing dinner date in about 20 minutes... and 5 of it was spent waiting to see a server. A well paced dining experience should be 40-45 minutes. I felt like I should hit a buzzer as we walked out and say 'time!!' Which I actually mock did as we walked to the car. We love Red Lobster and this one is pretty close for us... but wow... might drive to another town next time.  I do get it... everyone has off nights.. but holy crap... pacing - it is so important!"}
{"text":"Food was good, but the server disappeared for about 25 minutes and left us hanging waiting for our check."}
{"text":"I had lunch here today with three colleagues.  The hostess (an older woman) needs to be replaced.  She was slow, abrupt, blah and not friendly at all.  Wendy, our server, on the other hand, was great.  We were hungry and she kept us in those yummy cheesy biscuits.  None of us had been to a Red Lobster in years and devoured the biscuits.  Wendy brought us two baskets.  Plus she kept our glasses full of pop.  I'm not a fan of seafood so ordered the Cajun Chicken Linguini Alfredo.  Other than the parm cheese they put on top (I'm not a fan of parm), it was good.  A couple of my colleagues ordered the lobster rolls with chips and said they were good.  I'd go back."}
{"text":"Gord and I had lunch today at Red Lobster.  It was a busy popular spot for lunch.  Virginia, our server, started us off with cheesy biscuits.  Yum!  I'm not a big seafood lover and ordered what I always get at Red Lobster ... Cajun Chicken Linguini Alfredo.  My meal came with a salad, which I gave to Gord.   My meal, as usual, was delicious.  I'm not a big fan of Cajun spice in general but I find it works well in this dish with the Alfredo sauce.  The chicken was really tender.  Gord ordered Shrimp Tacos with rice.  He said they were really good and he'd get them again.  Virginia was pleasant and efficient.  Dave, the Director of Operations, Great Lakes Division, greeted us when we arrived and was a friendly guy.  He came over to chat before we left to find out how everything was.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Food is always really good! Although the service is not all that. First time we went we had a server who was in training and of course we understood if she would make mistakes. Although our second time, the server was slow and did not communicate well. We rarely had refills and was slow to give is our checks and run our cards. Even though it was not very busy. Food is great, service not so much."}
{"text":"Its been about 13 years since I ate @ Red Lobster..but I had to check it out since I saw one to many \"all you can eat shrimp\" commercials. Way back in the day just about my whole social circle worked @ RL in Orlando so I know exactly how things work here. Walking in was exactly like it was years ago. The place has not changed at all. We had a very nice hostess and an even nicer waiter. I ordered a drink and it was heavy on the booze..love that! Then comes the yummy garlic cheese biscuits I remember. My toddler was stuffing them into his mouth they were so good. LOL I of course ordered the all you can eat shrimp. I picked out shrimp linguine and shrimp scampi. And they were both very good. My little one had shrimp for the 1st time & kept saying Yummmm. The hubby of course had a strip steak & baked potato. He was very happy with it. I had a bite of the steak and it was very tender. I had my server bring me out 2 more rounds of scampi and was bursting after the shrimp pig out! I don't know why its taken me so long to come back to RL..you can bet it wont be another 13 years! This was a nice family dinner.  And FYI: the waiter hooked me up with a dozen of those yummy biscuits! Loved that!!"}
{"text":"It was my mom's birthday not long ago, last month, and decided to go back for the 4 course meal for $15. Very well worth it AGAIN! It was my second time at this location and I liked it much better than the Red Lobster on Decatur. This restaurant was cleaner, had nicer decor and staff was more focused on welcoming you than shoving you at whatever table they could find.   My selections for the limited time 4 course meal included, New England Clam Chowder, Caesars Salad, Scallop-Shrimp Alfredo pasta and the Chocolate Brownie a la mode instead of the Apple Frittata this time. This dinner of course came with the famous unlimited cheddar biscuits.   The soup was creamy, not the best I've had, but I really enjoyed it. Now the salad was delish, just enough dressing, crunchy, crispy and fresh. Now let's talk about that pasta. The Alfredo sauce was 3x better than the Olive Garden! The shrimp and scallops were cooked on point. Very well seasoned, super creamy.   I was kinda full and the waitress was super nice, she asked if I wanted my dessert packed to go! Not many places do that, you eat there or you miss out! I wanted my frittata warm so I opted to have it served. The apple frittata was small, in my opinion perfect size for an after dinner dessert.   -This second time around the chocolate browny was not as good, it was chocolate extreme to me. I should of went for the the Apple Frittata again.-  Most places that do the number course meals, as offers, tend to always give you smaller size, salads, smaller main courses, but NOT RED LOBSTER! Hurry up and grab some dinner, this special is limited and ending soon!"}
{"text":"Great Seafood Restaurant....has kept up and maintained its standard over many years. In fact, variety of dishes, and food even better than before...Good value, excellent service, great specials..."}
{"text":"So we ordered food 30 minutes before the people next to us and guess what...they get served way before us. Our waitor really seemed like he did not know what he was doing. Will not be coming back."}
{"text":"My husband and I love coming here again. For awhile we had stopped because of the service,  but ever since we started getting Ryan as our waiter, we come back repeatedly. They revamped the menu and while it is slightly more expensive, I've discoverer some new favorites. We highly recommend this place and, of course, ask for Ryan."}
{"text":"A group of family ( 6 of us) went to the North Olmsted Red Lobster for dinner Saturday evening 12/16/17. Very big disappointment. We first ordered drinks. There was absolutely no liquor in them. We had to order a shot for $7.50 to add to it. They said everything is portioned electronically. No liquor is no liquor no matter how they are made. The six salads came. Talk about controlled portions 3 salads consisted of maybe 4 bites,2 had about 6 bites and one was so full it was falling out of the bowl. No croutons. Dinner came. No tarter sauce with fish, really. Now at this time we still did not get any rolls. Everyone around us did. The portions on the plate was horrible. They could of used salad plates. We did call the manager over, she apologized  and took $10.00 off the bill. Needless to say our bill was $185.00. Not even 10%. We did hear other people complaining also. Now I understand why so many of the Red Lobster chains are closing. I am sure this one will be next. We were there between 4 and 5 on a Saturday evening the weekend before Christmas. There were maybe 5 tables being used. We kind of thought something was wrong then. We should have known. We get more food from the McDonalds $10.99 dinner box. And two shots of liquor costs maybe $5.00. And we spent $185.00. Never again!"}
{"text":"Now I love red lobster but this particular location pissssssed me off!!! It was packed as usual so the food took extra long. the waitress screwed up my bill at the end of the meal, when they seated us it looked like the booth had not been properly cleaned, and the bathroom was just the nastiest bathroom in America. Like i said i understand it was busy but that is no excuse for how gross the bathroom was. i almost threw up from the smell and you could just tell that it probably had not been cleaned all day. I believe when you are an establishment with meals over $10 your bathroom should be spotless. This is something you would expect from burger king or somewhere, not red lobster. I know red lobster is not a 5 star restaurant but come on."}
{"text":"Red lobster is one of my traditional spots to come for special occasions including Christmas Eve. I always go a couple times at the end of the year because my family knows I love it here and gifts me with gift cards.  I always love to recommend the ultimate feast, but it is quite a bit of food. However, I also recommend their Caesar salad and substituting a couple of new England Clam Chowder if you're not a salad person."}
{"text":"Dh & I went late Sat nite @10...they're open til 11 why does everyone go at once earlier? got right in immediately and its quieter too. quickly ordered our drinks and dinners; we both had the Seafood Trio special it was good! I had a lobster pasta, 3 little crab cakes, and the bourbon shrimp on a skewer with rice. Plenty enough for dinner with the salad and their famous cheddar biscuits, even got a doggy bag. quite the deal for $15.99 each. great service... paid the check and we were in and out in less than 45 minutes... boom!"}
{"text":"I have to admit, I have a problem with their scones. I eat wayyyyy too many. We had a group of 7 and we were able to get seated pretty quickly on a Saturday night. Service was pretty quick through the night and tons of scones! Even got a bag of scones to go!   I had the Ultimate Surf and Turf, which had this tasty maple butter on the beans and potatoes. The lobster was cooked well, but the steak was pretty awful. But that's what you get for steak at a fish place. Tasted like there was no seasoning at all.  Dessert portions were big and i was given an ice cream as it was my birthday! (just celebrated a bit late haha)  Again, i'm not really a fan of Red Lobster. I just really love their scones."}
{"text":"Dinner Time Did not have to wait long to be seated. Our server Andrew awesome and on point. Started with their amazing bread and ordered an appetizer Langostino  Lobster Artichoke Seafood dip , oh my world delicious. Next our salads perfect. This young man is attentive and all items are coming out timely. He was literally watching our table when we needed drinks anything. So refreshing! Next came the main course I had the Ultimate Feast and hubby Crab Lovers Dream. And again the entrees came timely let me just stress that. It wasn't like here you go hurry up and eat, no it was more like take your time and enjoy your dinner. Both of our entrees were AMAZING & DELICIOUS the Ultimate Feast says it all gives you a bit of everything Maine Lobster Tail, Snow Crab legs, Garlic Shrimp Scampi, and Walt's Favorite Shrimp and very filling. My husband loved his entree getting 3 types of crab: Snow Crab, King Crab, and Crab Linguini Alfredo wonderful and filling. So hands down food awesome and waiter awesome. If you go ask for Andrew he will take great care of you!"}
{"text":"My server was excellent. Small stature, beautiful smile, and quirky. His name, is simply-- little dave. great shrimp."}
{"text":"We were quickly seated, served and our food came out quickly. My chicken sandwich was nice. So why the 1 star? I love seafood and have eaten at some amazing seafood restaurants in my time. Unfortunately Red Lobster uses MSG in a majority of its seafood. 85% of the time I eat at any Red Lobster I get sick within 30mins -1hr, so much so I need a bathroom very quickly. Two separate managers at different locations and corporate all admitted they use MSG extensively. MSG is banned in many countries as its so bad for you. The only reason its allowed in the US is that the food industry keeps pressure on the FDA. Red Lobster is the only chain I know that uses MSG and a no go for seafood. Feel free to look up MSG...linked to strokes, heart attacks, several organ failures, etc"}
{"text":"The service here was excellent! The waitress was very friendly and attentive, even though she was very busy. The food was very good, can't beat the cheddar biscuits! The seafood was fresh and prepared properly. I had a very good experience."}
{"text":"Great place for seafood. Their biscuits are amazing and free. The lobster was also terrific, it was a nice quiet and civil atmosphere with the exception of a group of middle aged woman getting drunk but this is ronni fault f the establishment. The food was terrific and I would definitely frequent this place again."}
{"text":"I haven't even been seated yet. They told us 30 minutes at 3:40. It's 5:00. They offer no apology or explanation. The girls at the front desk has no clue what's happening. Servers are coming up and trying to seat people because tables are open and no one is getting seated. Steer clear. McDonald's would be a better choice."}
{"text":"Seriously, I'm not sure exactly what happened to Red Lobster over the past twenty years, but they've gone so far downhill that I would honestly rather have the seafood at swiss chalet or Kelsey's... or basically everywhere else.   Twenty years ago Red Lobster was very expensive in comparison to the competitors, so it was always reserved for special nights out. Perhaps because they've made their meals cheaper they've also cheaped out on the quality of their food? Not sure, but if that's the case, I'm sure everyone would rather either pay more, or get a slightly smaller portion, and get fantastic quality instead.   In any case, over the past 5 years, I gave been to Red Lobster over a dozen times, and each time it's been progressively worse. The only thing they seem to make well every single time are the garlic shrimp - their little biscuits, when done right are absolutely to die for- unfortunately they are hit and miss, so either you get a delicious little bundle of garlicky goodness, or you get a bland, salty, or undercooked blob.   My last visit sealed the deal this past Canada Day. I will not be returning to any of their locations unless it's under duress. While the servers are always very nice, service is terribly slow, and it took almost an hour for our waitress to return with our bill, after a series of epic failures that meant after our two hours there I didn't even get a chance to eat my meal there- it only arrived when the check did!  Our mussels came out so scorched and overcooked they were literally textured like paper. There wasn't even any liquid in the bowl- apparently nobody checks on even visible quality control issues in the kitchen. I ordered an eggless meal (due to allergy), and then she sent me the egg option... after making us wait twenty minutes so she could confirm allergy information. My boyfriends lobster tail was actually rock solid- to the point where you literally could not even stick a fork into it- no matter how hard you tried.   When we brought up the toughness of the lobster to our waitress she said \"well that's because it's not regular lobster its rock lobster- not everybody is a fan of its different texture\". Ummmm no. So we handed her the fork and knife and asked her to cut it - she couldn't, of course, and at that point she apologized profusely, because this was the second thing we had received that was so overcooked it was literally inedible.   Oh and that eggy meal that took an hour and a half to finally be replaced? Yeah, when I finally got to eat it after we got home later that night, there was grit, sand, and shell in every bite, the majority of the shrimp still had poop sacks, and the shells of the mussels were still dirty (I had ordered one of the seafood boils).   The only thing we got all night, and actually generally another thing that is consistently made well, is the stuffed mushrooms. For a $100 bill, I expect to eat more than a few baked mushroom caps and soggy biscuits.   Dousing food in salt does not fix the issues it has. Sigh. Get your act together, R.L. the least you could do is make the lobster right... IT'S IN YOUR NAME!!!!  All the good reviews it has gotten really makes me worried for the palates of Canadians.. It really really does."}
{"text":"Payton was the best server we've had in a long time, the male host was great as well so thank you both for that. Experienced a lot of negative jerks called hosts lately so we appreciated him being kind and seating us as quickly as he could. Bar drinks came quicker than we ordered them so kudos to the Bartender- Food really wasn't as spectacular as the quick and efficient service though. The king crab didn't really wow us although it was warm... the shell was a bit on the soft side making life a little more difficult because those suckers spikes were not soft at all- of course I know we're eating at red lobster/chain but you'd hope they would specialize in its seafood selection and amount with the price they hit you with.. I guess you can't go wrong with the biscuits, at least. They never let us down. They should call themselves Best Biscuits and offer seafood as the side options."}
{"text":"I would rather eat a raw fish out of Tempe Town Lake than have to sit through another disgusting meal at Red Lobster. Gggggeeeeerooooossss!"}
{"text":"This location is MEH! Always overcrowded. The waiting room is too small for the number of people who are waiting to be seated.   I ordered takeout - crab legs and shrimp linguini. The linguini was good but the crab legs looked like they were 4 days old, and had almost NO MEAT so it was a total waist of money. If I was dining in I would have sent the crab legs back and got a refund. Not going to this location"}
{"text":"Been there for two times. the amount of food and service is good. I won't say the taste of food is not good. But it's also difficult for me to say it's awesome"}
{"text":"Attractive on the outside with a professional look. Sat at a booth next to a very dirty wall. Ordered shrimp cocktail which was served with 6 shrimp on a very hot plate. Obviously just out of the dish machine. Yuk. Salad was ok. Salad appearance did not pop, could have made it look good with 15 seconds of attention. Dinner was flounder and broccoli. It was good. Service was fine. Could have been a much better meal with attention to detail and pride in their work."}
{"text":"Thank you Dale for the great customer service. Great recommendation on the sweet chili shrimp. Our server David was amazing. Food was fresh and on point ! We will be back !!"}
{"text":"My third time to a Red Lobster. The music and decor haven't been updated a what appears to be a very long time.    Had the ultimate feast, deep fried shrimp (2.5/5), butter bathed shrimp (3/5), lobster (4/5), and crab legs (4/5).   Feeling very stuffed but enjoyed the food.   Service was up and down, quick on the refills but took a long time to bring the bill.  She was sociable but not overly friendly."}
{"text":"After sampling many chain restaurants, I know that not all chains are created equally, even if they operate under the same name.  I've stopped by Red Lobster restaurants in other towns and have been overwhelmed by delightful, positive experiences, so I thought I'd give the local one a try.  When I went on a weekend night packed with other customers, I was concerned about wait time but fortunately my party was seated almost immediately.  With so many patrons vying for the attention of their servers, we were overlooked and felt we got the cold shoulder because of our age (a young college group).    The interior is old and ragged, which conveniently fits the \"shipwreck\" theme.  We were pushed into a dark corner (intended to be \"romantic lighting,\" I think), but I could still make out the wear on our seats and the carpet.  For dinner, I ordered one of their \"daily catches\" and had it cooked on the grill.  The fish was bland, unmemorable, and did not justify the cost; the only flavor came from the lemon that I judiciously squeezed on top.  As for my side dish, I was horrified by my broccoli.  It had been cooked beyond redemption, with each bud shriveled and blackened.  The saving grace of the meal was the biscuits (crunchy outside, hot and buttery inside), which have been consistently good between all of the Red Lobsters I have visited.  At the end of the meal, the bill for my boyfriend and I came out to about $40 (including tip).  Not a happy customer."}
{"text":"I hadn't been to a Red Lobster for ages and decided to come and check it out during lobster fest. And I had a coupon too which was a nice bonus.  I forgot how much I like this place. The free cheese biscuits are sooo addictively yummy. You have to make a conscious effort to push that bread basket away.  I like that you get a salad with your entrees too. I got the pick two and hubs got a lobster dish. Everything was delicious and did not disappoint.   What made this red lobster exceptional was our server. She was really good at what she does and made the whole dining experience wonderful. Bravo!"}
{"text":"Don't quite like the western way of cooking seafood and 20-30 dollars for several bites of shrimp is not that worth it. I guess my hubby likes the biscuits which is why a lot of ppl go there."}
{"text":"A great experience. Mom, Grandma1, Grandma2, the Toddler, and I took the one-year-old out for his birthday dinner.  It was the one-year-old's birthday!  The staff was great and didn't mind The Toddler walking around the restaurant meeting everyone.  Our server (I don't remember his name,sorry) even gave the little spud a sundae and sang Happy Birthday.  It was the OYO's first ice cream and he loved it.  He wants to add his input...so here goes...89bujm8buyjmnujmik,.m,  nmh,ytgcytghkc.  Thanks again Red Lobster."}
{"text":"Red Lobster isn't one of the first places I think of when I am in the mood for sea food.  As evidenced by reviews that are all over the place for this location you never know what to expect.  We had a good meal, and the staff was extremely friendly and attentive.  Our waiter, Martin, \"Marty\" was great.  Constantly checking in with us and suggesting menu items.  It looks to me like they are really trying.  Ask to be seated in Marty's section."}
{"text":"Food ok. Bartender Cody excellent !! Would go back for the crab legs !! Busy area but close to highway if you need a quick business dinner !!"}
{"text":"Husband and I just had dinner here it was fantastic everything was more than delicious our server Brendan was wonderful, Charming knowledgeable and attentive. He talked me into a seasonal blue drink that was very strong and delicious and you get to keep the glass which I like. He kept the biscuit basket full and kept our drinks maintained are Lobster was juicy and succulent and the lobster mash potatoes were mmm mmm yum. Thank you Brendan for a unique pleasing dining experience all around. Also it was my birthday so they gave me free brownie with ice cream so that was nice right?"}
{"text":"The last time I ate at red lobster was at least 15 years ago and now I remember why. I don't eat at these crappy chains but I admit I got sucked in by all the commercials. That salty over cooked fish is lobster? The food for me was completely inedible. I apologized to the server who was very nice and helpful and admitted she doesn't eat there."}
{"text":"I got the 4 course feast for $21.99, which I thought was a food deal. The clam chowder and caesar salad that comes with it are pretty good.   Now when it came to the main I got the cajun chicken linguini. This meal was the biggest joke, it was the most brightest white, rubbery, inedible chicken I ever had.  I actually think it may have been raw. I've been to a lot of foreign countries and ate chicken but have never came across something like that and surprisingly at Red Lobster.  The server saw me picking my chicken out and quickly went and exchanged it for a shrimp pasta which was just ok, but at least edible.  The brownie that you get at the end is ok if you are into really sweet stuff."}
{"text":"I came to Red Lobster tonight as a \"late\" Valentine's Day dinner date. My boyfriend and I both really enjoyed our meals and the service was outstanding, as always. Emmett was out server tonight, and he was very friendly and made sure we were well taken care of. Our food was out not even 10 minutes after ordering.   I had the Lobster Lover's Dream which was delicious.. I mean anything with Lobster is always fantastic in my books. Definitely recommend coming to this location, as everything is always fast, friendly and delicious!!"}
{"text":"For the price you pay here, there are better sea food places around town that you can get a better over all experience for your money. We ordered raw oysters for an appetizer which was pretty good. I ordered a pound and a half of snow crab and my lady ordered a lobster bake with a cream sauce over linguini with mussels shrimp and scallops. Both of us were underwhelmed with the overall quality of the dishes we received for our main course. The corn and mashed potatoes that came as sides with my meal came out ice cold (seriously, cold to the touch) and the corn tasted like it had been boiled for days (absolutely no flavor to it) then soaked in liquified butter until it had the texture of pruning fingers. I have eaten crab A LOT in my life at many a restaurant and I can tell you for absolute certain that the amount of crab I received was not the advertised pound and a half. MAYBE a pound (two pieces of legs), which was disappointing. My lady said that her linguini was very overcooked (and it sure looked that way to me) so she stuck to the meat in the dish and didn't even eat the noodles. Our waitress was very good, and I tipped her very well, but it honestly was hard to enjoy the meal (over 100 bucks after it was all said and done) because the quality of the food was so disappointing. We are huge fans of Joe's Crab Shack and enjoy Pappadeaux as well, and only tried this place to try to save ourselves a drive (we live in Peoria). Next time we'll drive the extra 15 minutes. I am giving this rating a two star because our server was extraordinary, but the service did not make up for the quality of the food."}
{"text":"two simple words:  endless shrimp!!!  oh yeah!!!"}
{"text":"Lunch on a Tuesday at 12:30/12:45. Place is dead inside so you'd think you would have great service and food. Wrong. Appetizer came out and after just one bite our entrees hit the table and they were cold. Server is non existent. All I want is some butter to take the chill off my grilled shrimp. Finally I get some but only after she stops at two tables to take their orders. Doesn't check on us but was quick to pick up the check when I put my card in it. Sad experience."}
{"text":"Food was amazing no complaints there took my mother in law here for her birthday asked the waitress to do the singing for her with the ice cream when they came with it they set down the desert on the table asked whose birthday and left no singing no enthusiasm nothing they acted like it was inconvenience to them ice cream was melted and they walked off horrible service I wish I remember the waitresses name she is just plain horrible"}
{"text":"Food was great. Our waiter Gregory was rude and didn't care about our needs. He yelled at the birthday boy. And just didn't have time and rushed our order. Do not recommend!!!!"}
{"text":"This review is for the location at 9415 Pineville-Matthews Rd, Pineville, NC 28134  It's been about a year or more since I've been to this location, but I have to say not much has changed. The host wrote down our group information wrong when we're came in, and rather than just correcting it and getting us in as soon as possible, they deleted us from the list 30 minutes after we'd arrived and made us start our wait over. It was an hour before we were seated. Then it was another hour before we received our food. All of the plates were scalding hot, meaning they'd been sitting under heat lamps for a while. My broccoli arrived raw, and my lobster tail was so burned and overcooked that it felt like sawing through leather. Several of our sides didn't make it out at all, and they forgot several people's salads. To be fair, I think our server was excellent and did what she could, but it couldn't make up for the rest. I'd bother to complain to the management about it if I thought it would make any difference. Hopefully corporate will be more responsive. We arrived at 5:30pm and couldn't leave until 8:15pm."}
{"text":"Bar Harbor Bake. Literally tasted like \"boil in the bag\" squash. Virtually no distinguishable flavor, just garlic butter through and through."}
{"text":"There were hardly any people when we arrived. We were promptly seated. Our server provided excellent service. From what we ordered I would recommend staying away from rock lobster tail. It's just not good at all -just stick with maine lobster.  This location was friendlier than others we've been at."}
{"text":"Honestly the only downside is how much business they do so it's packed and wait times are rough some times but hey thats the price of having great food and a nice cleanly environment."}
{"text":"Best pina coladas I've ever had, the seafood platter was amazing! Excellent service as well, came here on a busy night and our waitress was very busy but still managed to service us in a professional manner. Can't wait until my next visit :)"}
{"text":"I came here on a Friday night with 2 of my friends. It wasn't busy for a Friday night which meant a shorter wait time (cannot make reservations). We waited for about 10 minutes until a table was ready for us.   The restaurant is quite large and spacious but a little run down. It's got a cabin-like interior once you step inside of the restaurant, and some areas are a darker than others (lack of lightening).   Once we were seated, we were greeted by a kind waitress who walked us through the menu. We ordered our drinks and meal ( I got the ultimate feast).  Upon waiting for our food and drinks to arrive, we noticed that there were a lot fruit flies flying around us. The wooden walls were rotting away and needed to be replaced. My friend also noticed a little cockroach crawling on the wall which is a major indication that this place needs renovations.  I couldn't focus on eating after seeing that cockroach crawl right behind me...  As usual the biscuits tasted buttery and divine. They were quite generous with the amount they gave us. Finally the main attraction came, the ultimate feast. It is quite a platter - deep fried shrimps (mine were cold and no longer crispy upon arriving to the table), broccoli (they undercooked and dry), buttered shrimps (not my favourite, so I won't comment on this), lobster tail and snow crab legs (which were both good- I mean they better be because this is what you're paying for).   Be wary of the utensils, most of the time they're not cleaned well. One of my forks was sticky and the other had a piece of dried up lettuce stuck on it since who knows when.   Red Lobster - what is happening ?!"}
{"text":"Customer service was excellent, food came out fast, the food was good, no complaints here I like this location. We have been to the Atlanta, Connecticut, New Jersey locations and this one might be my favorite so far."}
{"text":"I'm having a blast. My boy is living all the seafood. I wish my waiter was a little more attentive but overall my experience is great."}
{"text":"I should have known better, but after a couple of years of avoiding Red, I tried it again tonight.  Same small, overpriced, tasteless food.  The King Crab legs were a joke.  I think they came off midget crabs and had so little meat in them they were empty!  Their commercials make stuff look so good, but when you get it, you don't believe it.  Gonna be at least two more years before I go again.  BTW, the service was ok."}
{"text":"This place is usually packed and today was no exception. Luckily, the wait was only 5-10 minutes today. They also had a deal today where if you buy a $50 gift card, you receive a $10 coupon or free app in the New Year. Decided to buy a gift card since I knew my foodie partner and I were going to go over that.   Food: 2.5/5 Got the ultimate feast today (lobster tail, garlic shrimp, fried shrimp, king crab, and rice). The lobster and crab were nice and sweet, however, the shrimps were extremely salty and the rice was really dry. The butter on the side did not help with that ($31.99) My foodie partner got the salmon and lobster tail. They said it tasted alright - one plus side is that you can substitute the shrimp for scallops at no additional cost ($29.99)  Service: 3.5/5  The lady that serviced us was polite - she kept refilling our drinks voluntarily which was great. However, she kept forgetting to bring us certain things such as the bill."}
{"text":"Service was great, very attentive and had knowledge about menu and different options! On top of drinks too. Food was good we had no appetizers the bread they bring was fantastic didn't bring butter but was great without!! I had 2 different lobsters with the linguine and I definitely preferred maritime lobster over Atlantic! Linguine was good with asparagus as my side, it was cooked perfectly! Our friends liked their meals, both hubby's had different versions of the surf and turf , my hubby inhaled his! And our friend finished his with no complaints!   Been awhile since we were here at least 4 years, but we will be back, it was good!!"}
{"text":"The wait was 30 min but the service was great! Our waiter was nice and he came by to check our table all the time to see if we needed anything. Thanks Ron :D I think it was Ron. Hopefully it was Ron. Sorry Ron. Lol but anyway spent our 6 year anniversary there today. And it was a great choice. :D will be back again for sure."}
{"text":"I'm sure most have been to red lobster before that being said this location is everything you would expect. Food and service was great not too much of a crowd for dinner on weekdays. Does get busy on weekends at times. Been here dozens of times and have always been happy with my visit."}
{"text":"Best service from Lexi.  The restaurant is large and comfortable, but peaceful and relaxing.  Our food came out perfectly spread out and amazingly well cooked.  I haven't been to Red Lobster in 5 years, but I will absolutely return to this location!"}
{"text":"Family friendly and food is consistently good! With a big family, this place is just right!"}
{"text":"Our server Justin was fantastic, you could tell that he was working hard to try and make it a pleasant experience. Unfortunately the food was terrible.   The clam chowder was good but cold, and the lobster bisque was so salty that we could not eat it. We were still charged for it regardless of sending it back. The coconut shrimp were good as well, but the garlic butter shrimp were more or less just grilled shrimp. No garlic and no butter at all...very dry and disappointing. The side was plain steamed broccoli, no butter or seasoning whatsoever. The only part of the meal that I thoroughly enjoyed were the biscuits...which disappointingly were never refilled after the first basket.  I may give another location a try but we will not be returning to this one."}
{"text":"Went here with my family. As usual, we always have a pleasant time here. Service was excellent and our waitress was very courteous and helpful.   Food wise, it was just about average as you would assume for a chain restaurant. The complementary garlic cheese biscuits has gone downhill since the good old days. They used to be more cheesy and garlicky. Now they are just too bready (if that is even a word). They need to use more butter/garlic on top.  I ordered the create your own combo $21.99  (picking two from a list). I chose the coconut shrimp (there were 8pcs) & the shrimp linguini alfredo. It comes with a salad & choice of side. I've always enjoyed those selections, especially their linguini alfredo. That has always been very tasty. After the 4th or so coconut shrimp, I grew tired of it. Perhaps next time I will try something else!   No hassle with reservations just a few days prior. Lots of parking in the parking lot. Good for large groups."}
{"text":"Yet another place that was dying because of the bridge construction that has jacked up their prices exponentially.  We went in for the 4 course dinner and all of a sudden it's only available Monday-Thursday.......all the other things we'd have gone for on Sunday weren't available except during the week.  Once again a place with zero customer service and another that has permanently lost my business. Surprise is fast running out of decent places to eat.  Extremely disappointed."}
{"text":"This used to be our favorite place.. We drove 62 miles from pahrump  Nevada to eat dinner here. We hadn't even completely set down when the waiter started reading off appetizers, I said we haven't looked at the menu he said no worry here is what you have for appetizers. Then he started suggesting drinks I would've like to set down enjoyed looking to see what was on the appetizer list, enjoyed seeing what I wanted to drink without being shoved down my throat. Everything was came out of so fast. It felt like they wanted to just get us in and get it out and get the next table him for the money. When my food came out so fast my crab legs were cold, and my broccoli was cold! The whole experience was just horrible I felt like I was it at McDonald's standing in a line. Rushes in Russia out! When the waiter took back my crab legs to be heated up again I hired the cooks in the background yelling and cussing.."}
{"text":"The stuffed Maine lobster is great, highly recommend The food size is huge and great for big stomachs"}
{"text":"Disappointing.  Ordered the crab boil.  Way over cooked.  Bland.  No flavor.  Blah."}
{"text":"The place is always busy! Food is good for the price...BUT this restaurant really needs a CLEANING CREW! Place is filthy! Pictures on the walls, moldings, trim, booths, and tables are just filthy! Such a simple thing and so many restaurants seem to fail. This place does a great business, so I'm sure they could afford the clean it!   Even the salt & pepper was too slimy to touch. Wait staff works hard, food good, but dining experience would have been more enjoyable if the place was CLEAN!!!"}
{"text":"Came in and was greeted with a smile. They sat me right away hostess was super chill. Crystal was my server. She did a pretty good job with drinks, food and the check. Her laugh is awesome lol food came and was amazing. Lobster was good, shrimp was real good, baked potato was great (but didn't come with the shabang like bacon bits and all that just butter sour cream and cheese) and the salmon was bomb! And of course the biscuits were amazing. When leaving I was thanked for coming. Overall it was a good experience!"}
{"text":"What can you say about Red Lobster.  It has been around for ages and is just flat out hit or miss.  Some days the food is great, some others, not so much.  What I'm beginning to believe in my old age is that this is just the nature of fish places.  You are only as good as your fish you get off the truck that day.  I mean really...  We live in the desert.  Getting fresh seafood here is a challenge at best. However, this... was a good day. Everything was fresh and tasty, the wait staff was nice and the price was not horrible.  (The drinks kick it up fast tho)   Damn you long island ice tea!  A good experience and we'll go again."}
{"text":"Melanie was absolutely great...the food was good but the service was impeccable...thank you Melanie for making pop's birthday a great one"}
{"text":"Enjoyed my experience here very much on today's Monday lunch run - everything was pleasant, from the food through the ambience through the service. To start off, I loved the biscuits - perfectly crunchy and seasoned on the outside, and delightfully soft and toasty on the inside. And the seafood was absolutely on point, of course. I finished every morsel of my Fire-Grilled Lobster, Shrimp and Salmon dish, and grabbed the Chocolate Wave for dessert (the chocolate cake was quite rich and I couldn't finish all of it - it was good, but I did need the ice cream to help wash it down). All in all it was really satisfying and filling. The booths were comfy, with a nice view of Dundas, and the music playing wasn't too annoying or loud either.  Both the waiter and the hostess were friendly, and food was brought out at a very timely pace which was great when you're a bit tight on time at work. When I asked whether my mashed potatoes could come with gravy, the server said they don't have gravy, but he'd come up with a substitute I could try and ended up bringing us some lobster bisque (no lobster of course) on the side at no extra charge... and to my surprise the mashed potatoes actually tasted pretty good with the bisque! I would come back again if I'm in the area and craving seafood and have a bit of $$$ to splurge."}
{"text":"I'm a little late with this update however about 3 weeks ago I decided to try Red Lobster again after seeing a commercial and really craving it. My experience was completely different. Chrystal was my server and she was great. There were just as many people in there as the last time, except this time I had my food delivered efficiently and Chrystal continued to check back in with me. She knew I was on a lunch break so she made sure to bring the check early so I could get back to work on time. My experience here was completely different and I will probably attend again when Chryst is working ;-)"}
{"text":"I called in an order on Sunday night (slow). I was on hold for more than 10 mins finally placed my order. Got the food and when I came home they forgot our 12$ add on lobster tail, a side, and sauce for the coconut shrimp. Had to drive back waited forever to even the food they forgot. And after all of that the food wasn't even that great especially for the price. I want to pay for quality and that service and food was most definitely not!"}
{"text":"Worst lunch/dinner restaurant. My family & I went there for the unlimited shrimp, it seemed to us like we were trying to rip them off.  First off you can only have 1 reorder at a time, but then you had to reorder; one had to fish out a waiter who then had to get our waiter to then place our order who then brought it to us COLD.   Then when we didn't eat the cold food,  we were told \"we don't give doggie bags for endless shrimp if you don't eat it\".  So, don't take it home to reheat. They toss it and you pay for it.   That's OK,  its America...  Let's waste food while others starve.  The attitude and service of our waiter we could have been friendlier, we could have done without attitude. Not to mention the broccoli my son ordered was molded and  turned upside down in its dish. The kitchen manager tried to convince me it was seasoning. Really? Any veggie lover can spot bad broccoli a mile away."}
{"text":"Came to this location for a family dinner and the food again was excellent! I ordered fried catfish but also sampled other dishes at the table, shrimp scampi, coconut and fried shrimp, all were great. Our server was very friendly & allowed us to order off the lunch menu as well. Old school location and vibe, will be back!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and sat at the bar. The bartender was very genuine and very attentive. Had fried catfish and and beer. It was excellent as I have had catfish at many places in town and this was as good as any. Thanks!"}
{"text":"To sum up my dining experience tonight in one word it would be, AWFUL.  The food was terrible.  To start off with I ordered a calamari appetizer and the largest piece of calamari was smaller in diameter than a nickel.  It appeared that whatever was left in the fryer basket was dumped onto a plate and served to us.  There was very little calamari, it was essentially a serving of deep fried vegetables.  Very unhappy.  The lobster stuffed mushrooms that we ordered were ok.    Both members of my party ordered the lobster and shrimp trio and both of us were highly dissatisfied.  The lobster tail was extremely rubbery and dried out; there could not have been more than 1-2 oz of meat total.  The shrimp were also extremely small and appeared to be slimy and undercooked.  I ate one of them and refused to try another they were so bad.  The lobster mac and cheese was burnt on the top yet also somehow soupy and watery underneath, it was also inedible.    As I write this to you around an hour after leaving red lobster both members of my group feel sick to our stomachs.    This was not an inexpensive meal either.  I would assume that if your restaurant advertised a \"Lobster Fest\"  and charged $25 dollars a plate the customer would get food that did not resemble leftovers from a low end chinese buffet.  Every piece of seafood was so incredibly small and disgusting to be completely honest.  I am extremely dissatisfied with my experience and I want a full refund immediately.  I have been a huge fan of red lobster restaurants for many years and have gone to different locations all over the country and have generally had a good time and great food.  This particular experience was un acceptable.    I would not return.  The staff was friendly yet extremely rushed.  Our meal took over 90 minutes."}
{"text":"So, my neighbor invited me out to dinner at the last minute and suggested we go here. I haven't been to a Red Lobster in ages, and wasn't sure what to expect.  Yes, I've seen the commercials, but the last time I think I actually set foot in one was around the summer of 1997.    Anyways, we came here and I have to say, I actually had a really good time.  The place was pretty busy, with lots of families and couples dining here having a good time.  We started out with the hot spinach, artichoke dip that had some seafood in it. That was pretty good, but was super duper hot!  Dam near burned my mouth! lol.  For dinner I went with a trio plate, that came with a lobster tail, some barbequed shrimp on a stick and some shrimp in a lemon butter sauce.  Surprisingly it was all really tasty!!    the rice was a little under cooked for me, but it was okay and I only took a few bites.  The salad was good and they also had some great biscuits before we had our meal that I liked as well.  I also treated myself to a margarita and I liked it. It didn't seem to have a lot of booze in it, and kind of tasted a bit weak in my opinion.  more booze in the drinks please!!!  What really made my night was the service we got.  I loved our server! She was awesome!  I can't remember her name, but she was so good, that she would make me want to come back because she really paid attention to us.  My neighbor forgot his phone and we were standing outside the truck talking and she even walked it out to us!    Thank you Red Lobster for leaving a good impression on me. I didn't think I would have had such a good time here.  Maybe I should come here more often...."}
{"text":"Red Lobster is not all that. The Shrimp was shrimpy and under par.   The food was was too greasy  and garlicky for me and I love butter and garlic. The Shrimp Linguini Alfredo was delicious on its own and very heavy. The Garlic Shrimp  was not at all succulent and the Hand-Breaded Shrimp was awful.    I doubt these people would know a good shrimp if one hit them in the face. They were so tiny like those cheap shrimp rings you get at No Frills.  The waitress was pleasant enough and the staff was polite. It was clean and well kept. We had to wait almost an hour from the time we were done eating to the time we actually walked out to pay our bill. When we finally got the debit machine we ended up settling up our bill and leaving it sitting on the table and walking out.   I doubt we even had to pay and probably could have walked out with the machine.   It was a spontaneous decision and I would have rathered Jack Astors but on a plus side it was quiet and we didnt have to yell over music to have a conversation."}
{"text":"It's red lobster. Amazingly sub par seafood for a major seafood chain. We only went for the all you can eat shrimp which was decent. Waitress was very friendly and we had good banter all night"}
{"text":"The cheesy bread is my favorite part of the experience. I also ate shrimp Alfredo and it was pretty good. Danay, our waitress, was very kind and efficient. She did not forget or mess up anything. I recommend checking this place out! You'll definitely enjoy it."}
{"text":"I keep trying to give this place second chances but it never works out. I always end up disappointed by the overpriced meals and the terrible service."}
{"text":"I never eat hear, except for special occasions. Always have good service and reasonable food."}
{"text":"On Friday lunch last week I had the best service here that I have probably ever had at a restaurant. She went above and beyond. It was truly a pleasure! My daughter and I each got the 30 shrimp. We had food to take home it was so much! The new shrimp on the special are really flavorful and a great value for how much you get. The meal comes with a side, salad, and the amazing cheese bread. We had giftcards from the holidays left to use and we also had a coupon. I hadn't been to a Red Lobster in a really long time and this was a very pleasant experience that will bring me back here more regularly."}
{"text":"Try not to go on a Saturday afternoon just before a rush. You might not get served at all because the kitchen cannot handle it. My party of three ordered and waited and waited and waited. Then we told the ppl we want it to go. Then we waited and waited and waited. Right when we stood up to leave is when they brought our food. Now we are at home re-heating the food which is pretty low brow. Red Lobster USED to be a nice place to go. It is a bit low end now. I could actually tell that by looking at the clientele. I'm sure I will not be going back. If you read bad reviews, heed them. Save yourself the time and money."}
{"text":"The food here was typical as what you would find at those commercial restaurant. It's was ok. Nevertheless, the 2 stars came from the lack of Military and or law enforcement discounts."}
{"text":"Great dinner for 2. Valentines day special, the wife and I were very pleased with the service and food. Good cheap seafood for 2"}
{"text":"Terrific customer service.  They were out of several items we had asked about, and the manager came to the table and apologized and took care of the bill. Something she didn't have to do but was very much appreciated. Will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"I've always avoided Red Lobster only because I think when it comes to seafood, I'd much rather spend the extra couple minutes on Yelp searching my options and spend that little extra on food that, if not fresh, can make you instantly ill.  Now I never got sick at a Red Lobster and will go back once Discover Card sends me more $10 coupons, but until that happens, sorry Red Plopster, I will be passing.    This location seems dark and gloomy, with out dated decor and slow service at the bar (based on 3 separate trips).  One highlight that is worth mentioning is their Lobster Nachos, I do love those things.  If you get the calamari, expect a huge platter of veggies too, kind of a mess, not very good presentation.  They do have a lobster machine so you know that's fresh.  Anyway, go to Red Lobster if you want seafood on a budget.  Otherwise, take a scenic drive to Pickle Bills or look online for a local restaurant serving similar dishes, you'll be surprised on what you find."}
{"text":"Went to dinner here Friday night. Excellent service and food. Good bar drinks too. Hubby had the shrimp too and I had the crab legs. Very tasty on all accounts. The place was hopping and well run.  If you want a decent seafood dinner and drinks for a reasonable price you won't go wrong with this particular Red Lobster!!  I highly recommend it"}
{"text":"Always an awesome experience at this Red Lobster.  Good food, good service, & good atmosphere.  Prices are a little high, but everything is worth the price. =)"}
{"text":"Someone needs to retrain the guy who answered the phone on 6-29-18 at 2:00 p.m.  I called several times asking to speak to a manager and was repeatedly  put on hold.  At 2:28 I was finally able to speak to a manager. When I arrived there, I stood in the lobby for minutes before I was finally greeted.  Also, after I ate, I had to wait 20 minutes for my waitress so I could pay for my meal.  The food was delicious, BUT the customer service was disappointing/ terrible!!!   PLEASE train the employees to treat customers the way they want to be treated when they spend their hard earned money."}
{"text":"I love me some Red Lobster.  No matter which one you are at, you are bound to have a good meal.  Our waiter was very nice, but he obviously had too many tables because our glasses sat for a good long while before they were being refilled, and if you come for endless shrimp, you have got to have a waiter that comes to the table often or else you are going to be sitting in between orders waiting for more food.  Also, we must have came on kids' night because there were three different parties with young kids that were running around the seating area and screeching at the top of their lungs.  I understand its a family restaurant, but when kids are yelling and running around constantly and bugging other guests, the management staff has to politely intervene."}
{"text":"I cannot say much in particular about the service and dining experience at this Red Lobster, as it is as similar as others. However, a particular items from their menu has left an impression.  My boyfriend and I ordered drinks: a Berry Mango Daiquiri for him and a Blackberry Amaretto Sour for me. these drinks are definitely worth the money! not too strong, and not too sweet. if you enjoy sourness like I do, the amaretto sour was perfect.   Entrees: Lobster fish tacos for him and flounder with lobster mashed potatoes for me. Carb overload, but everything was well-seasoned or very buttery (i  butter).   a tip tho: plates vary in size. fried items, there seem to be more of while there are few boiled fish items (like lobster or crab) that weren't as well portioned."}
{"text":"Ok so 5 stars is do to our server Keith. Food was good and in few bites great! Nothing bad to say about the food! Service someone that cared. Didn't rush us! No pressure . Just all around Great service! Mango Mia Tia was good! Bloody Mary little well plain!"}
{"text":"I meet my mom for a quick lunch here all the time since her work is right across the street. We've never really had a bad experience when dining even when I have my son who is 22 months now and can be a handful. The service is always great and the staff is very friendly. I love their soup and salad special just wish they had a couple more lunchy type options."}
{"text":"This place will always have a special place in my heart. (especially this location)  I was trained from young, as my late sister would bring me here with her son, when I just a little girl.(my sister was a lot older than me). she would bring me here and teach me the lobster eating ways.   I relate a lot of nostalgia to this place but none the less, the restaurant itself I must has not lost its touch. The service was great, just like I remember. The waitress was super nice and super knowledgeable. The dining setting looked a little bit different from what I remember, but still clean and homey.  The food was still so delicious, and the portions are crazy, I had to share with my mom because those platters were huge! the biscuits are to die for and of course our waitress just offered us a second round of biscuits, so I couldn't say no!   My aunt had the steak, which was cooked correctly to her liking, she offered me a nibble of the steak and I have to say \"surf and turf\" the next time I am at red lobster will be a must.  If i could afford to eat here every week, believe me, I would be here every week! lol"}
{"text":"Very bad experience here. Waitress named Kavita was rude to us from the start to the end. While taking our order she showed us a tremendous amount of attitude. Rarely visited the table, never smiled, never said you're welcome, and there was little sign of manners. When we asked for the bill, she didn't split it, so she had to re print the bill. Even after the bad service she had the nerve to tell us to tip. She left with the machine when the last person had to pay and returned by slamming the machine on the table and shaking her head. She then left without thanking us."}
{"text":"It's Red Lobster so it's basically the same no matter which one you go to. I've been to this location roughly 8 times.  So far, We have received what I consider good service once. They other times were mediocre at best. Spotty service, no recomendations, slow to greet, long periods between check ins and refills etc.  Why order a drink from the bar here?? It will be all mix and no liquor. Just get beer they cant water it down if you order a bottle. Beer is overpriced as usual. The happy hour price is what most places charge normally. So happy is nothing exciting.  Food is about 6/10 if you love seafood and have tried other places. Red lobster is essentially starter seafood and the taste is toned down for the Sun city crowd still. I notice most places in Surprise have stopped catering so much to the older crowd of Sun City and realize that surprise is getting younger. It's unfortunate that they cater to the older crowd and sacrifice Taste of food when they could be bringing in more people by catering to all ages.   All n all I come back when my daughter asks for shrimp or Lobster and I don't feel like driving to Hot n juicy or Angry crab etc"}
{"text":"I love this place and the food but the service today here at this location kind of let me down. Took us about 40 mins to get entrees and we are currently waiting to order dessert and are sitting here for about 15 mins now. We ordered the seafood trio shrimp and New Orleans salmon which were good but seems as tho we were in an area where no one cared to check on us."}
{"text":"I'm quite disappointed at my last visit at this Red Lobster. I've been coming to this restaurant for 10+ years, and I've never been disappointed until now. The drinks & most of the food were great like always, but the service was not good.   First of all, our waitress seemed hesitant bringing us more biscuits after we were done with our first round. The second basket of biscuits she brought were cold and half of them didn't have salt or flavour on it. She also gave us a dirty take out bag - which I pointed out and then asked for a new one. She brought the second one, and it was STILL dirty??? It looked like coffee spilled on the bottoms of the bags, but it's still pretty unprofessional. Not really the waitresses fault, but I found it weird she didn't notice that she gave us a coffee stained bag both times.   The main incident which pushed me to write this, was the fact that the staff were gossiping about me. When I first arrived at the restaurant, I had a panic attack and almost fainted. This happened a few minutes after we were seated. This accident was due to my personal health issues, but I tried my best not to make a scene and to be as subtle & quiet as possible. We stayed in our booth (which was actually off to the side) and I had a puke bag but I could barely move. I know it's gross, but common... you think I wanted to throw up and almost faint at your restaurant? It was an emergency circumstance and I thought I was gonna have to call an ambulance. Yet, even with all this happening, the hostesses found the energy to talk sh*t about me. It's funny because I left a complaint about a hostess at this location before. A previous time I came, the hostess blatantly ignored me and did not seat me. I don't believe it was the same girl, but I guess the manager didn't learn his lesson about hiring rude hostesses. Anyway, the two hostesses working that night were CLEARLY talking about me and giggling, especially when I was walking by to go to the washroom. I find that extremely disrespectful and immature, and spoiled my perception of this restaurant. In addition, near the end of my meal, my friend told me that he overheard the waiters (and manager?) talking about us, and staring. This isn't as bad, but stuff like this really makes me feel uncomfortable."}
{"text":"Haven't encountered any problems with the food or service here. On the contrary, service is great (especially when King is your server ) and meals are quite delicious! I usually order shrimp and lobster specials (ultimate feast is super yummy!). Their latest shrimp special was mouthwatering. Between two people, we ordered four varieties; argentine shrimp, coconut shrimp, garlic skewer (came with rice) and shrimp scampi. By far, the two best kinds were the argentine red shrimp and jumbo coconut shrimp!! So good, I'm salivating just thinking about. Portions are huge. Each dish is served with unlimited cheddar bay biscuits and a starter salad (or soup) and a side dish (steamed broccoli, fries, mashed or baked potato, etc). I will definitely return for those shrimp specials before this deal ends!"}
{"text":"I visit this location from time to time. On our last visit, we were celebrating a birthday and our waiter was neither interested nor attentive. We figured he was having a bad day.  Food was good. Had plenty of leftovers for the following day, which was great."}
{"text":"Service year was excellent customer friendly food was great would recommend all friends and family to come here best wishes Toronto"}
{"text":"Wonderful service and excellent seafood ! A great place for a romantic dinner . Happy Valentine !"}
{"text":"Happy the endless shrimp.  Not impressed with the two new flavors this season, but the oldies are still tasty.  The server was spot on with drinks and refills on the shrimp and one reason rating so high.  Best time to go if you like shrimp because you can get your fill and this location is one of the better run in the valley."}
{"text":"So we just finished a quick dinner here. Only came for appetizers because we had to get to a location soon.   Now I must say I never mentioned this to our waiter because I figured we had enough time, however Jimmy was WONDERFUL! Not long after we sat were we greeted and told about the specials. He took our drink order and shortly came back with bread and ready to take the rest of our order. When we told him we were only getting appetizers he assured us that he would put it all in together.   Food came out promptly and tasted delicious. Jimmy also came by to make sure that we were doing great.    Overall I wanted to say - thank you for never disappointing us ( lol so dramatic ) and thank you to Jimmy for the excellent client service."}
{"text":"To go order Tuesday night waited a few minutes on the phone for my order to be placed, waited 6 minutes to get cashed out because the printer jammed, didn't get Any lemon for my soggy popcorn shrimp that I asked to be well cooked for extra crispyness and mashed potatoes were runny. No cutlery. Not happy. But biscuits were Hot!"}
{"text":"Those darn cheesy biscuits are still some of my favorites after all these years, pretty unreal. I could probably just come to Red Lobster for drinks and cheesy biscuits.   Came here for lobster fest, service was great, cocktails were good & our entrees were tasty. The oysters were not so great. Salad was pretty sloppy/over dressed."}
{"text":"I have never had the service like I did today with the Bar Tender Ashley. She is so attentive and the food was delicious ! Will always love this place and appreciate it more now that Ashley is my permanent server !!!"}
{"text":"One of the better locations in vegas. (Red lobster has obviously gone downhill in the past few years). Service 2/5.  Food 3/5.  Price 3/5.  Overall 2.5 Went here for lunch (around 3 pm). Our waiter seemed overly annoyed to be at work and rushed us through lunch. The food  Fried shrimp and fries: fries were hot and fresh and the fried shrimp was well seasoned and cleaned (some red lobster locations do not clean the shrimp).  1lb of snow crab with corn on the cob and mashed potatoes: the snow crab was hot....but not exactly fresh. Tasted as though they mixed some of the old crab with some of the new. Mashed potatoes were very good! Corn on the cob tasted microwaved:/  Water glasses had food stuck to the inside of them .....:( had to ask for new ones. Probably wont be back. Too many other options in the area."}
{"text":"If there's an option for negative stars then that's what it would be. There was 6 of us total that walked in at 8:15 on a Friday night and was told that there was a 25 minute wait which was actually pretty accurate. We sit at the table and 10 minutes goes by and still no server. Finally our server comes by to take our drink orders and appetizer order. 15 minutes goes by and he never got us our drinks and so he starts helping the other table behind us and then this new server (which she was really nice) came by and said she's going to be helping us out tonight. Another 10 minutes goes by and finally we got our drinks except for one of us which ordered a beer. After a few minutes he finally got his beer which had some sort of lipstick on the rim of it and had to send that back. Since we waited so long for our drinks, she was nice enough to give us a free appetizer. After a little over an hour we finally got our food which half of ours was cold and no one had eaten their food. After asking for a manager 4 times, this \"manager\" came over to our table (she wasn't really a manger she was like an acting manager) and was nice about it and told us the kitchen was crashing and they were very understaffed. Overall DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY HERE!! Go to Captain Steve's instead."}
{"text":"Only place to get seafood when you are in the desert.  This is our local business in surprise and as usual excellent service. The early dining shrimp cocktail was ginormous and delicious.  Lobsterfest is going on but expensive."}
{"text":"I haven't been to Red Lobster in years, but I have to be honest - it wasn't great.   I initially ordered shrimp scampi and was told that would only be shrimp in a sauce - without noodles. Until this visit I didn't know shrimp scampi to be without noodles. (Since my visit, some people have told me that it can be without ... I digress)   I ended up ordering popcorn shrimp with fries - not hard to get wrong, right? Well, the food was bland and the shrimp were over-fried.   Our server was very sweet and friendly, but didn't provide great service! It took 5-10 minutes just to refill water after asking and to get extra ketchup.   I don't usually post poor reviews of places, but I honestly don't have a lot to say about this place. Overall, the employees were friendly but the service and the quality of the food was sub-par."}
{"text":"Food was average ( I had fish and chips , but I got much more  breading then fish ) silverware was  dirty - I picked up 3 different sets and I ended up polishing it myself - Prosecco was  not the best one and glass not polished. There was no nice music in the bar - dining area is very dark that's why we decided to sit at the bar - our waitress was nice though.   Overall dining experience was not the greatest and I am not looking forward to go there soon."}
{"text":"My fault.  I thought i had great memory 15 yrs ago at red lobster so that I take my out of town relative there.  Nope.  And i wonder why they are still in business.  The food brought on incorrectly, the food, all of them, are overly salty and inedible.  Service is very questionable.  The place was empty and my waitress who disappeared for 20 mins.  Spent $140 for 3 adults and 2 kids.  Should have gone to golden coral, 1/3 of the cost and 3 times better food.    Will not be back."}
{"text":"We had a great dinner here. Our server, Angel, was very welcoming and our service was timely and responsive. We posed a challenge with a shellfish allergy at the table - but it was all managed very well - and no allergy issues with the chicken tacos - with specially broiled chicken. My stuffed lobster tail was better than the drier grilled lobster tail, yet the flavors were all good."}
{"text":"Being from the East Coast I love my seafood.   I'm disappointed to have to give this rating as I was really looking forward to some good seafood.  However I have to be truthful..it was just not up to standard for the price paid.   Our starters came out with our mains right on their tail.  So while enjoying our salads and lobster bisques our mains where getting cold.  Not to mention it sure cluttered the table.  We had to ask for the cheese biscuits which didn't come until we had pretty much finished our meal...by that time I was unable to enjoy them.   I had the Bar Harbour Lobster Bake.  Great amount of shrimp, lobster tail was tasty and the sea scallops were nice and tender...however my mussels where dry and the shells brittle.  Also way too much pasta and no sauce.  My husbands dinner ( Portofino Seafood Bake) was grossly covered in oil.  Both of us picked out all the seafood and left our starches.  Not worth the $30 per dish.   I do have to say we had a pleasant server, she was funny and joked about with us."}
{"text":"I want to complain about our horrible experience in Las Vegas off Decatur......my waiter was David and the manager was Rhonda Cox, we were seated at 745pm and did not get anything to eat til 857pm. Everyone else around us came in after my party of 6 was seated  and multiple people with bigger parties were served their food, when I had talked to Rhonda about it to let her know she told me I was wrong and that we had only waited 25 minutes. For a manager to tell a customer they are wrong and to blame the waiter instead of taking ownership is completely unprofessional. I have never been so appalled by the attitude and by the service especially for a tourist city as vegas. Never will I go to another red lobster especially for a first timer here."}
{"text":"sat at the bar. witness the lady bartender scooping the ice with a glass.  felt vomiting after eating."}
{"text":"Does Red Lobster even need an introduction? This seafood chain has been serving customers for decades.  Obviously seafood is what Red Lobster does best. Lobster, crab, fish, if it came out of the water they serve it here. And for those of you who absolutely loathe seafood, fear not. There's a good variety of other items as well, so regardless of your tastes I'm sure you'll find something.  The problem here isn't with the food (for the most part), but rather the service. Too many mistakes are made. Once I ordered chicken strips, and the waitress brought me a full-blown grilled chicken breast. How could you possibly screw THAT up? Another time I asked for mayo, and the waitress said they didn't have any. Is it LEGAL to run a restaurant and not have mayo? Yet another time I said I wanted a promotional item they had advertised on the menu with no asparagus - sure enough, it came with the asparagus. However, the staff generally rectify their errors, so I'm not going to insult them or anything.  Point is, the food (which is what you probably care most about) is top-notch. If you can deal with some potential staff errors, you'll have a pleasant dining experience."}
{"text":"Middle of the road is all I can. I want to love Red Lobster, I see their commercials for All you can eat shrimp, or Lobsterfest and start drooling and think to myself, we have to go there that looks GREAT!  Every time I go I am more and more disappointed. The wait times are always long even for a chain food restaurant.  The meals are always sub-par for what I am paying. I don't expect San Francisco melt in your mouth 200.00 a plate goodness, but I do expect something more decent besides chewy lobster tail.  The service is OK, our waiter was really nice this last time, but I just wasn't overly thrilled with everything else.  All in all I believe Red Lobster (this location and the Metro Center Location I can attest to) should revisit their menu and kitchen prep as a whole. With all of the competition out there now putting forth some effort would be worth their while.  I would find somewhere else to eat if I were you."}
{"text":"We were celebrating a birthday at Red Lobster in the Mesa location (Alma School & the 60). My boyfriend paid & we immediately walked out without picking up the receipt... that was important because I wanted to give our server a huge five stars. I hope this makes it's way to her. Her name was Jane & she couldn't have been nicer. She was WONDERFUL!"}
{"text":"service is hit-and-miss.  food is typical red lobster."}
{"text":"We have been here several times. The food is always amazing. We highly recommend the calamari appetizer; everything we've had has been delicious.  Some of the wait staff need to be more congenial....but the food is amazing."}
{"text":"Had an amazing server \"Jesús \" he was very polite and always made sure we were happy throughout our meal , couldn't ask for anyone better :)"}
{"text":"Talk about 2 star food for 5 star prices.   For starters, we ordered the breaded calamari, lobster bisk soup and the shrimp nachos. The calamari was so salty, it was unbearable. It was no longer edible. The soup was, again; salty.  The nachos, consisted of cheese whiz or runny cheese instead of melted cheese and we could not find any shrimp  in the nachos.   For dinner, I ordered garlic jumbo shrimp, which, unsurprisingly, salty. The rice was so bland, no flare. The garden salad was drenched in ranch sauce. Than I had a taste of my friends' dish which was pretty good.   The service was not bad.  I had high expectation for Red Lobster, because its my first time returning from several years, and remember the food not being bad. In conclusion, I am really disappointed."}
{"text":"We love this Red Lobster.  The service and food are always near perfect.  Our favorite anniversary spot.  Whenever Shrimp fest is on--we're there!"}
{"text":"Service was great.  I went in solo for an early dinner.  I was seated at a booth for two in the bar area and the bartender was essentially my server.  My drink was topped off often and my needs were anticipated.  However, the food is nothing like I remember.  The salad was served in a warm bowl so my greens were warm and starting to wilt.  There was also a ton of dressing on the salad and there was at least two tablespoons on the bottom of the bowl when I was finished.  I got the stuffed mushrooms and I got six tiny mushroom caps filled with not much stuffing.  The mushrooms were no bigger than a size of a nickel, and I was used to larger mushrooms, quarter size or larger.  I also got the Admiral's Feast which is fried fish, shrimp, scallops, and clams.  The shrimp are not like they used to be.  There was way too much breading on the shrimp and it wasn't the delicate breading like I remember.  Everything else was good.  I was extremely disappointed in the salad and the shrimp but didn't complain because they were still edible.  My leftovers were reheated in the oven the following day and tasted just fine."}
{"text":"Came here for a weekday lunch.  Wow!  What a difference in service than in the city!  (Charlotte/Pineville)  The server was friendly, fast, and attentive.  The food was very delicious as well.  I'm happy there is a large variety of food available on the lunch menu at lower than dinner prices.  I had the Sailor's Platter which is fried shrimp, shrimp scampi, and broiled flounder.  It came with a side and salad, and I chose mashed potatoes and Caesar salad.  The fried shrimp were \"new\" style crispy shrimp, not the traditional Walt's Favorite Shrimp that I'm used to.  I'm disappointed that the seafood stuffed flounder has been discontinued and I plan on contacting corporate about that.  Overall a great visit with excellent service and great food."}
{"text":"My mom and I went for an early dinner on a Saturday around 5:30. Completely packed with a 30 min wait. We thought it wouldn't have such a wait at this time but oh well.  Our waiter was ok. He started off kind of rude but had an issue with the table beside us so his behavior kind of changed because I think he got in trouble with the manager.  Initially I asked for him to tell me which menu items were gluten free. His response? Nothing. I'm gluten free myself and can't eat anything here.  Huh, really? Then why does it say in the menu to ask your server for an allergy menu? So he goes to get it, while stating, you won't be able to eat anything here anyways.  So he brings the menu, which was essentially a large list of the foods and the allergens in them. It also had a indicator if cross contamination was a possibility (such as with the same grill being used for gluten foods, etc). Lo and behold, there were foods I could eat. Interesting that he didn't know this, seeing as how he works there and apparently eats gluten free.   Anyways, once he actually came to our table the first time- which took a good 10-15 mins after being seated (for initial introductions and drink orders) the service was pretty prompt. We didn't have to wait a particularly long period of time for anything after that.  I ordered a caesar salad (sans croutons) which was okay but a little on the blah side. For my entree I had lobster with potatoes and corn ... I can't recall the name. It was good but very, very salty. I feel dehydrated just thinking about it. My mom also felt that her food was very salty. That kind of took away from the experience since it had such a intense effect on how the food tasted. They need to lighten up on the salt for sure.  Overall the food was just okay for me. I don't know if I'd spend the money to go back unless mom wants to go again (Mother's Day gift ;) ). They definitely need to work on their server knowledge of gfree options as well as their oversalting of food."}
{"text":"Red Lobster!! My first experience with this was so long ago I'm embarrassed to say but let's just say I was 8.  Now I love me some seafood; especially crab legs.  Red lobster always has on there menu 1/2, 1, or 2# of crab legs either alone with a salad or in a steamer with baby red potatoes and a chewy little half cob of corn.  Price is excellent. The best time to go is actually around 2:30 during the week or 4:00 on a weekend.  The service here is very nice.  Always acknowledged at the door and seated as soon as possible.  Drink orders are taken in a few minutes and then a bit later the entree ordering happens. Then.... The cheddar garlic biscuits arrive!  Every time I try so hard not to eat the biscuits because first of all they're loaded with kcals, and secondly they're very filling.   Then salads arrive and I have to remind myself not to talk too much because before you know it the entrees are there.  That's the lack of 5th star.... I always feel incredibly rushed.  The crab legs come out perfectly steamed and along with the proper little utensils to crack if you need and pick the luscious crabmeat out if it's shells.  They also bring out the lemon scented towelettes not just one though about three per person and lots of extra napkins without asking... Bonus points for my servers.  They're also very good at keeping drinks filled and encouraging dessert which I've yet to be able to try.  One day we'll eat backwards with dessert first.  Overall, pretty darn delicious for a chain restaurant."}
{"text":"I would never in a million years rate this place with 5-stars in a city like Toronto with fantastically amazing food just a stones throw away from just about any neighborhood downtown. However, my boyfriend and I enjoy seafood and especially shrimp so we come here to eat as its directly across from work and an easy place to go for dinner.  It gained its two stars for a few reasons: usually we don't wait for a table, at lunch or at dinner time and the food is consistent. Not consistently amazing or anything, just consistent. The biscuits are yummy and I always get second helpings, but the staff isn't always eager to bring me second helpings of biscuits for some reason. I can almost never finish my entire meal (usually the downfall of me eating so many biscuits) but I get to have leftovers for lunch which is pretty good most of the time.  I can't agree that the service is top notch at this location. The staff frequently stand around the computer stations talking instead of getting drink refills or checking up on their customers. And when your section isn't that full, I'd rather see you doing your job than screwing off where you think I can't see you. I've never seen any manager troll the areas to ask people how they're doing either. Which probably would give them some good quality feedback that they could put to good use. I've had some fairly negative staffing experiences at this location: servers trying to tell us that they're 'fighting' over who's table gets biscuits first in the back (give me a break - its lunchtime and you should have plenty of those bad boys); ordering something pretty basic and having them get it wrong, taking away my plate while my friend starts to eat and 5 minutes later bringing back the same wrong plate with the right part on the side (I could have spent that time eating); spouting off random friendly crap that you know is 100% insincere and taking FOREVER to get drinks (seriously, it takes less than 1 minute to pour a pop out of a fountain machine).  Although there are better places to eat in Toronto, when you're craving shrimpies and greasy cheese biscuits, nowhere will satisfy that craving like Red Lobster.   Perhaps I need to start rethinking WHY we eat here so often..."}
{"text":"I went with my in-laws and wife for lunch, and was glad to see that they have a lunch menu that's available every day. Most places only allow the lunch menu on weekdays, so it's nice that theirs is good on weekends too.  The biscuits there are always a favorite, so points for that! Super oily, so I try not to eat too many, but they taste really good.  The meal part was not as great. My wife ordered shrimp tacos, which tasted fine. I ordered broiled flounder in an attempt to eat something healthy, but it was really quite flavorless. My wife couldn't finish her tacos, so I ate one and put the fish in it, which vastly improved the flavor"}
{"text":"They no longer have a happy hour which is a real bummer. Who doesnt have happy hours these days?? The biscuits were amazing as always. We both ordered crab legs. The top part of the crab was practically frozen still but other wise they were good. The lobster artichoke dip was good but they dont have any salsa available to go with it. Also order your salad dressing on the side, they like to drown the lettuce if you dont! If you want a drink order beer or wine. The mixed drinks are almost all ice and arent worth the money."}
{"text":"My son came to see us before he had to leave for a tour of duty over seas. Before he left (tomorrow) we wanted to have a nice meal together. We were hoping to have a great meal to remember. We got there early (before 6) and there were a few people there. Where do they seat us? right by the kitchen. Lots of empty tables. The waitress was very nice and took our orders. The hor's derves come. We ordered the Calamari and an order of Clams. The Clams were very small and were more like bits and pieces. The Calamari was good but not much of it. Then our main course comes. My son and I ordered the NY strip and Lobster. My wife ordered Flounder. My wife received her Flounder with a weird seasoning on it. We tried to scrape it off but could not get enough off, She could not eat it. My son and I also received our steaks without the lobster(we ordered the steaks medium). Both steaks were literally raw. In my whole life I have never sent anything back but I did this time the manager came over and was very nice and said he would comp one of the meals. The steaks and lobster came out a little later. The lobster was ok. I don't know how they did it but half my steak was just right. The other half was over done. Now I try to eat it. What a poor cut of meat. It had so much gristle that I could not eat it. To top it off, once we sent the steaks back the waitress did everything she could to avoid us!   I guess we need to drive the extra mile and go to Pineville if we want to eat at Red Lobster."}
{"text":"Always the skeptic of chain restaurants, I went to Red Lobster with low expectations. However, the lobster rolls were rich and delicious and the potato chips freshly made with great flavor. The decor and service were heads above the last time I was here."}
{"text":"We ordered 2 big combination dishes and let me tell you, TONS OF FOOD, even for 3 people and we couldn't finish it. The dishes had a lot of either butter or oil in them so be prepared to go into cardiac arrest.   Cesar salad was simple -nothing to talk about.  Spring Rolls were ok.   I give it 4 star for the crab !!!! YUM  I will go back and only order crab legs...that's how good it was."}
{"text":"My family lives in Chandler so we get to this area frequently. We had a gift card to offset the purchase, so it made this location ideal, and we are seafood lovers.  The decor and inside of the restaurant was lovely and clean and we were seated immediately (a Sunday around 4:30pm)  It was my wife and I, and our 2 boys, 7yrs and 20mos. We were greeted by a \"seafood specialist\"  Whenever I go to Red Lobster I always order the Ultimate Feast (lobster tail, bredded shrimp, shrimp scampi, crab legs). The meal is so tasty I am beside myself, and this time was no exception. I am not crazy about scampi for some reason, I'm sure it is considered good. I would have rather had a few extra breaded butterly shrimp.  I didn't want the eating to stop, the crab legs were succulent and the lobster melted in my mouth. The melted butter didn't hurt either  The wife shared this dish with me and we added another order of crab legs and a bowl of soup.  The soup was lobster bisque, which is probably my favorite *type* of soup. This soup,howver, was slightly disappointing. It was tomato-based, not cream-based, and I've had better. The bowl was $6.50, which I consider well above average, but the waitress gave us the $5 price because she misquoted.  Terrific cheesy biscuits and average sald consumed as well.  I order the Sunset Passion Colada, worth every penny of the $6.75.  Overall the experience was exceptional, but I have to temper it with the fact that I believe the restaurant is overpriced, even for seafood. Our tab without tip came to $56 for 2 adults and 1 child, and my wife and I even split an entree.  I believe this true for all Darden restaurants as well. I wonder how much longer Red Lobster and Olive Garden will get away with this. Bahama Breeze went out of business in Phoenix because of pricing.  I recently reviewed Olive Garden and gave it 3 stars."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere! Server Tiffani was on point! One of the best servers in the industry! Fun, personable, knowledgeable and overall amazing to have sat in her section. Food is ok, but I will definitely be coming back and on requesting TAFFANI!!!!!!"}
{"text":"We've been craving cheddar bay biscuits for a while now and was excited to have lunch today at Red Lobster. I ordered the shrimp linguini alfredo and my husband had the build your own 3 choice on the menu which he chose a steak as one of his choices. The steak was cooked perfectly, medium rare, and the pasta was cheesy goodness with plenty of tiny shrimps. The side salad was drenched though with the champagne vinaigrette which sounds fancy and wasn't bad, but I miss the raspberry vinaigrette (told it was gone with 9 months ago, bring it baccckkkk). The biscuits were still great and we kept getting refills. The ambiance though is lacking, I'm used to the dark wood, lake house feel, but they need to brighten it up a bit. Again we were having lunch and it felt like 7pm already and it was only a little after 12. The service was friendly, but I could tell everyone was kind of going through the motions. And the food presentation was lacking which wouldn't be a big deal if the marketing and the menu photos did not show such bright and exciting colors. All and all, we will still return when we get those cravings again for the biscuits."}
{"text":"The food here is better than some other RL's I have been to.  Aside from it being cooked well and not burned or dried up.  The portions seem to be bigger too!.  We ordered:  Appitizers: Escargots and Stuffed Mushroom.  Both were good and the cheese was not burned.  The stuffing on the mushrooms were filled and not dried.  Entrees (shared): Shrimp Side Trio; Shrimp Luiguini, Garlic Shrimps and Butterfly Battered Shimps.  All delish! Comes withh a salad so we got Ceasar.  Right portion of dressing, croutons and shaved cheese.  No bacon which is perfect for me and Clam chowder which was not as hot... but was ok.  Our waitress was attentive making sure our food arrived quickly and our drinks is always filled.    The only thing they can improve on is the tea pot they serve their tea in.... way too small and does not even full the mug it comes in."}
{"text":"Food was ok... my snow crab was dry and lobster was a bit over done.  The battered shrimp was mushy... which was odd.  Garlic shrimps were good.  Portions were not as good as I remember.  The waitress was pretty attentive so that was good.  It seemed to be quite busy here.  The booth seating was a bit tight for the other 2 friends of ours... bigger set couple.  The table was small for the plate sizes they brought.  Parking was limited even with the parking in the back.  Perhaps the pub next door had an event going on."}
{"text":"I am not sure where the low reviews come from, but I have always had solid service, tasty food and everything anyone could want from a restaurant experience. Sure there can be a wait during their promos (like Endless Shrimp) but, think, when there are lines out the door even for early dinner almost every time I've been there and waitstaff moving back and forth to quickly serve their tables, you can bet that the food and service there is first rate. Sure it is a \"corporate-like\" chain restaurant, but some people like that and the expectations of having a great experience there each and every time makes Red Lobster a popular place with a good business model. I have never had a problem. Not. Ever."}
{"text":"If I could I would leave negative stars!  Took my wife and in-laws to dinner tonight to have \"Lobsterfest\". Best part of our meal was our server, Jessica, who has worked there for 5 years.  She is a credit to her position and deserves a raise.  The worse part is that during my dinner TWO TINY SPIDERS fell from the ceiling (or lamp) on my head (the first time)-and arm the 2nd.  I told Jessica the first time and she was shocked.  The second time I was able to have her come to the table to witness it. She was horrified and got the manager.  Managers solution? Give me a $25.00 gift card. On a $200 meal!!!! Couldn't even apply it to tonight why would I want to go back to a dirty reataurant?  NOT acceptable. Won't be back, and will find a way to use the gift card someplace else.  Damn!! Dine at your own risk"}
{"text":"Have been going to red lobster for years and years now, and am happy every single time. How can something as simple as grilled shrimp be SO GOOD! Good mixed drinks as well and dessert. Popcorn shrimp is decent for the non seafood lover or steak. LOVE this place and their pasta is good as well. :)"}
{"text":"I have been to their different branches across a lot of cities and I am amazed by the consistency of their food. It's like the food is prepared by the same person, everywhere  Absolutely love their food and service. I have tried their seafood trio that consists of 3 items that you can pick from a list of items on the menu and a bunch of main course dishes having shrimp and the taste is amazing. I can say that is one of my favorites for my seafood cravings."}
{"text":"I have been to Red Lobster in Cleveland and Pittsburgh and I must say that they are one of my favorites for seafood. I am still developing a taste for seafood so I try to eat dishes that are properly coked and spiced and Red Lobster does exactly that. Do try their combos where you get to choose 2 or more dishes from a bunch of items available on their menu.  6/30/2018 I came here for lunch today and to bid adieu to one of my favorite persons.  We ordered a plate of Yukatan tilapia and shrimp, a seaside shrimp trio and taster of yukatan shrimp along with some blue oasis martini. Yukatan tilapia and shrimp has nice and spicy and came with herbed rice and fries as side. Tilapia was properly cooked and shrimps were large in size. The rice was pretty flavorful too.  Seaside shrimp trio had deeep fried shrimp, shrimp in butter and garlic and spaghetti in white sauce with loads of tiny shrimps. It also came with a side of garden salad and baked potato with cream on top. We also tried their Yukatan shrimp taster plate and the sauce was delicious.   If I ever happen to meet that person again, I'll make sure I visit one of the red Lobsters in town."}
{"text":"Horrible service and horrible food. I got the clam chowder with NO (none) clam on it. Our food didn't arrive an hour or so later... our waiter looks rushed and the restaurant is not even full. Disappointing experience. Do not come here."}
{"text":"We haven't eaten here in at least two years, since I try to avoid chains, but this ended up being our best option on a Friday soon after the 11am opening. Service was excellent from door to table to out again. Very attentive and pleasant.   I ordered the shrimp skewer meal from the lunch menu. The price was good and the shrimp were delicious. The broccoli was perfectly done--so many restaurants can't do crisp broccoli--but I really wish there had been more of it. I was trying to eat healthy so I couldn't have much of the rice pilaf, and veggies would have made it a more filling meal.  My husband did the choose-your-own lunch and had a shrimp skewer and shrimp scampi. Both were excellent, and he was likewise pleased that \"they knew how to do broccoli.\" He also had all of the Cheddar Bay biscuits, which he loved as always.  I was pleased that they had a lot of healthier options on their lunch menu. I think I would be more inclined to return here, knowing that--plus we always have great service at the Goodyear location."}
{"text":"You don't get what you pay for.  Fresh frozen is not my ideal seafood but when your birthday boy wants crab legs, and they have it on the kids menu ... Well time to try it.  Note to self, since they don't crack the legs for you or  even offer ( you need to ask them ahead of time) you'll spend all night cracking them for the kids and your meal will get ice cold.  Plus the nice gesture of bringing an ice cream out is nice. But unfortunately halfway through the meal doesn't help the fact that they still have a full plate of food to eat first."}
{"text":"Love the one in Sandusky OH.  Servers are fantastic, especially during the week days!  Food is fast and hot.  Offer a lot of discount coupons in local papers!"}
{"text":"Went for a late birthday dinner last night and it was good, not great, but just good. I had the ultimate feast and the other half got the endless shrimp. The ultimate feast came with shrimp scampi, fried shrimp, lobster tail, and snow crab legs. Everything was just ok, nothing that really stood out or to remember but it took care of my seafood craving. I enjoyed the lobster and shrimp scampi the most. The other half really enjoyed the endless shrimp, it was his first time getting it and he put the term endless to the test. Our server was really nice obliged him. They have a new Korean bbq shrimp which was really good also. All in all a good visit and a good meal. If you can eat a lot of shrimp i suggest to go for the endless shrimp promotion while they have it!"}
{"text":"My husband and I came here 8/14. Our waitress was super friendly. The service was timely and our food was great. I ordered the fresh catch of rainbow trout with blackened seasoning, corn on the cob, and grilled veggies. Although my veggies were a little soft for liking and my trout could have used a tad more salt it was nothing a little lemon juice couldn't fix."}
{"text":"I'm not a big fan of Red Lobster but I tried the Cajun Chicken Linguini Pasta dish and it was really good. I think it's the best thing I've had at Red Lobster so far. The prices are pretty good as well and I think you get a good amount of food for what you pay for so I cant complain."}
{"text":"Service was great, menu looked new , food came out fast and fresh . Very good portions . Was good improvement since I visited years ago ."}
{"text":"My family and I celebrated my cousin's college graduation here and we had a very good time. We had a party of 10 adults and no kids. The food was excellent and did not take long at all. Everyone's orders were perfect all around. The servers were on point with beverages and removing plates. The only reason they 4 out of 5 is we were told 15 minute wait at arrival and it took more like 30. Also no reservations by phone?"}
{"text":"My friends and I always planned a chain restaurant week, but it never happened.  For my birthday dinner, I was excited to get the opportunity to visit the Red Lobster as it's one of my top chain restaurants.    The outside looks like a dock house in Maine.  When you walk in, you'll see a lobster tank which reminds you where you're at.  The place is dark and intimate.  There's huge dark brown wooden beams and the overall lighting is low.  I was hoping the booths were a little bigger, but loved the windows looking outside.  Our server's name was Penny and she was super nice.  Refilled my water as soon as it hit half full which I appreciated.    For dinner, we started off getting the Lobster-Crab-and-Seafood stuffed mushrooms for $8.99.  Fresh mushrooms stuffed with seafood, smothered in Monterey Jack cheese and baked golden brown.  It was served in a baking dish and so delicious!  The dish came with 6 large mushrooms.  The cheese came with a slight crust from the browning and I loved it!!  For my entree, I got the Lobsterfest Rock Island Stuffed Tilapia for $18.99.  This dish was fresh tilapia roasted with crab-and-seafood stuffing and topped with Maine lobster meat in a creamy lobster butter sauce. Served with fresh broccoli and wild rice.  The stuffing was a little mushy and seemed like a lot of filling, however the rest was great!!  Loved the wild rice.  It was flavored so well, yet so simple.  The lobster cream sauce was definitely 75% butter and lovely!  The tilapia was nicely cooked and the Maine lobster claw meat was a nice touch!  Red Lobster is a humble place, but so on point!  I'm so glad that this place has made my top list for chain restaurants.  I will definitely be coming back to this place.  You should too!"}
{"text":"We have been going to this plase for years and the expirience is great. shor waiting time and the food is great. Iloke how the salad and bread come with the meal. Syrongly recomend"}
{"text":"My sister and I ate here on Christmas Eve. We both had the fried bay scallops and we both ended up with food poisoning! The other person in our party had the shrimp with no after effects, so we figured it had to be the scallops.The service was sub par. It took a long time to even get our food. The baked potatoes were not even fully cooked either. We had to ask for drink refills Our waiter brought our checks and we never saw him again, thus we left our paid bills on the table. Needless to say we will never go to a Red Lobster again."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with a friend, figured I'd use the gift card I got my from sister, bro-in-law & cat. I noticed at the front there was a sign stating apologies since they were still under construction. Upon entering it was hard to notice that this was the case. Oddly it seemed less than half full but there was a 5min wait. Ok, no big deal. The restaurant as a whole seemed nice n clean. Upon sitting I did see there was some minor touches unfinished but nothing that would bother anyone, even if anyone did notice it. Our server was the bartender which was a bit of a surprise. First time I've ever seen a bartender given tables on top of serving the bar and filling the drink orders. Jeff was very nice and courteous and even though at times it seemed like he was doing multiple things at once, he didn't let it hamper the service. I had the southwest chicken burger & fries. The center of the bottom bun got stuck to the plate. There was a small opening and the liquid from the toppings & burger were starting to seep through. Guess the skewer opened a hole and there was enough liquid to start leaking. Aside from that the burger & fries were good. When I got the check, I noticed he forgot to include a drink that was ordered($7 difference) and pointed it out to him. He was thankful for the honesty, so he told us to not worry about it, he wouldn't charge for that drink. What a nice guy, left him a little extra for that. Would definitely go again!"}
{"text":"Gave it another try becuz we know that onsite service at this location of Red Lobster is overall good.  Our take out order was missing a few items and a few items weren't up to snuff.  This time I called the Manager Amanda W.  I received wonderful response, great listening skills and errors were corrected.  Guess that shows you can let them know if you are not satisfied.  Again, the overall staff have always been very professional and willing to make your experience great.  This manager went out of her way to resolve and I'm so impressed becuz you hate to complain and this time I wasn't going to hide behind just writing a review!  I recommend that you always give a chance even if you have had a few times where you weren't happy with food, especially Take Out, please let them know.  Give them a chance to resolve.  Thank you Amanda W."}
{"text":"Great food but horrendous service. Went with my grandma, they said it was a half hour wait and they didn't even offer to pull her up a seat (benches were full) I had a random waiter offer help. Tables were open, apparently not enough wait staff but there were FOUR hostesses just standing around gossiping. We were seated an hour later. Terrible service."}
{"text":"Red Lobsters around the country have gone through a recent renovation of both their decor and their menus that you may have missed. The move has made the restaurant into more of an upscale offering, with concordant higher prices. It is the act of offering that is now more upscale, however, and not necessarily what is offered to you.  The change results in an additional menu section where you can choose any of a selection of fresh fish and then choose how you want it cooked (oven, pan or broil). Then you get a couple of their standard sides for $13-20. The rest of the menu, other than the big crustaceans, is cheaper than this. Its not a bad deal if the fish is good and fresh and then cooked skillfully. In my limited recent experience, (one recent trip to this location and two recent trips to other Red Lobsters) their cooking is hit or miss. I was very happy with my broiled salmon in terms of size, flavor and doneness. Others have been less enthusiastic, with classic fish complaints (size/strong smell/consistency). Don't worry, they still have their stupendous cheddar biscuits and the coconut fried shrimp with rum sauce that are even better. These shrimp are so good, I think of them as the crab rangoons of the Red Lobster and get them every time.  The rest is pretty much the same, but with slightly different (less?) stuff on the walls and probably higher prices than you may remember. They have a decent variety of beers and booze and a chain restaurant's expected  bevy of froofy drinks. But is it worth it? If you go for one of the shrimp or lobster fests, or you have a coupon or gift card to soften the blow, its definitely worth it. I am a pretty frugal guy, and even though I love fish, there are many places I would rather spend this kind of money at, like Yellowfin. If somebody spruces up Seaboat into a nice take a date joint though, its over."}
{"text":"Not too bad.   Service was decent, waitress came by frequently and re-fills the biscuit promptly.   The food was decent as well. The lunch specials were pretty standard. We also ordered the lobster tail, salmon and shrimp plate that's apparently new, and it was good but I wasn't sure if it was worth the $30?  Overall a good experience."}
{"text":"First time to red lobster since I was a teenager so I guess you could say it was my first time because I don't remember anything about this place except the biscuits which are actually better from the box if you make your own at home.   I normally don't eat at chain restraints but since I've had my baby I've had to do things more accommodating and convenient with a new baby. Hence why this was an easy choice close to home.   We came in and while my boyfriend was carrying in the car seat naturally they opened the door for us. Very nice of them. We were seated right away and given some menus. Our server came over and started is on drinks. Explained the menu a bit. I like that the restaurant  is dim so it was easy for my son to take a nap. I'm not much of a shellfish person so naturally j went to the land menu. I ordered the same thing as I did years ago which was the Cajun chicken Alfredo. My significant other ordered the shrimp.   I could tell my server hates his job. He seemed to even do a bad job at faking a somewhat friendly attitude. He brought us out some biscuits which like I said aren't that great but they're free and warm which I appreciate. The clam chowder was not that great. I think progreso makes a better one. Our food came out eventually and my pasta was ok. Nothing great or stand outish about it. Could have had more Cajun flavor if you're going to call it Cajun pasta and needed salt as it was kind of bland. The shrimp was served three ways. In a garlic butter sauce, fried and a shrimp with pasta Alfredo. The shrimp was a pretty alright as my boyfriend said which means it was ok. The Brussels sprouts were roasted to perfection and not very pinging like I'm used to. I'd say that was my favorite part of the meal. At least they got something right.   Not sure I'd visit again. Service wasn't that great and I'm not a seafood person anyway. 3 stars for overall experience. Nothing outstanding but it's a chain so what's really to be expected."}
{"text":"I'm definitely not a huge fan of this place even though I LOVE seafood. Their dinner menu is WAY over priced. I prefer coming here for lunch and for their lunch specials.  Their lobster bisque soup is GREAT and it definitely goes well with their cheddar bay biscuits :-)"}
{"text":"When I choose red lobster this is the location I always come to because the customer service is phenomenal with a great food taste thanks Sergio!"}
{"text":"There certainly were elements of my recent meal that were a yummy buttery luxury, such as the biscuits and escargot.  I ordered the stuffed sole and thought it was pretty salty.  The presentation was quite boring, but I suppose we have become spoiled by such things.  It didn't taste or look any different than what I could have served at home, but my effort was saved so it was a treat to have an average main course not cooked by me.    I must say that our server was overly enthusiastic.  She kept saying to my spouse and I that our food would be so great that we'd be back tomorrow.  Really?  I would have been okay with hearing this once but after a few times it was old and annoying.  It was slightly unfortunate.    The only thing I truly feel needs some serious attention here is the restroom, as the stall doors in particular were pretty greebly.    The restaurant was very busy and maybe this is normal for a weeknight.  I just don't go out during the week very often.  I think Red Lobster makes for a respectable family outing or rush choice meal but I'd go elsewhere on a date night."}
{"text":"This Red Lobster used to be very good. It has gone way downhill over the past 5-7yrs. Back in 2005-2006 the food was very good. I usually would get the Seafood platter, Flounder, Shrimp Linguini Alfredo or  Seaside Shrimp Trio. My wife always got the Crab Liguini Alfredo or Salmon. The last time we went was over a year ago. We thought we would give it another chance. Getting a table is never a problem, as this place is never really packed except on Mother's Day or Valentine's Day. Back in 2005 we would have to wait. We always get the cheesy biscuits and water/beer or soda right away. The cheesy biscuits is still the best thing on their menu.The water tastes like filters sink water, which is horrible. I couldn't even drink it. We got the Lobster Pizza and Lobster-Artichoke-and-Seafood Dip for appetizers.  Pizza was a little dry, but not too bad. The artichoke dip was still good. We got our salad after the appetizer. Why are their salads so watery? It's like they rinse off the lettuce and just drop it into the bowl. Then add the chicken and Caesar dressing. Half the lettuce was soggy or was too wet. Blah!! My wife ordered the Crab Linguini and I got the Seaside Shrimp Trio. The portion size of these meals have shrunk considerably. It seemed like I was missing at least 1/3 of my shrimp that I usually get. Some of the shrimp was tough to chew and not succulent like it should be. My wife did not like the Crab Linguini. Said it tasted funny. The crab may have been frozen or something, but she had eaten it many, many times in the past and it wasn't as good this time. It was bad enough we had to wait well over 30 mins to get our food. Then we had to wait awhile to get our drinks refilled. It just wasn't a good experience. The last 2 times we had been there wasn't much better. We decided to not go to Red Lobster anymore. At least not to any in Arizona. Stay away from this Red Lobster. The food quality has dropped over the past 6 years. One more thing. The place is way, way overpriced. $12-$15 for a alcoholic drink? Many meals $20+ and small portions.  Update 4/6/2016 - I wanted to update my review real quick and say that if you look closely on the reviews for this restaurant, you can see several FAKE BOGUS reviews that Red Lobster management or staff members have added. They are the 4-5 star reviews that only have 2-3 sentences and some of them don't even mention the food at all. They are obviously trying to increase the stars for this restaurant.  About 3-4 years ago I believe they had 2-2-1/2 stars. Now it's higher. Because of this tactic, I'm removing 1 star from my review. I suggest anyone else who agrees with me should do the same. How pathetic is this place?"}
{"text":"Lunch today on Sunday. Greeting was courteous and friendly. Seated quickly at nice table away from noise. We haven't been to red Lobster in about a year. Found menu a little confusing. Ordered two different entree's. Flavor was mediocre on both. Quantity for the price was underwhelming. Very nice waitress. Sorry on lack of name. Probably won't be back. For the price there are better choices."}
{"text":"Not bad. Sat at bar, decent mixed drink. Ordered 2 tasting plates. Took awhile but it was dinner time. Food was excellent. Will be back."}
{"text":"The waiter was so sweet so knowledgeable about the menu...the crab was great and so was the Pina colotta sooooo yummy..."}
{"text":"Tilapia Tacos were terrific, just the right amount of food for someone who ate too many delicious bomb.com Cheddar biscuits. The parmesan crusted Tilapia was equally good and filling and came with great sides. Warning do no get the sweet Bourbon mash, it's puree and not good, stay away.  Also had the coconut shrimp starter-so orgasmic good, the dip is to die for(salivates). Caution-no Wi-Fi, apparently you gotta talk to each other(as she yelps-lol!) We'll be back.  P.S.-server James was personable, speedy Gonzales, flexible with side changes, attentive, helpful and very friendly. Great service James#raise!"}
{"text":"I am slightly ashamed to admit that I like the Red Lobster. The cheddar bay biscuits? The salad? The popcorn shrimp? Come on now. It's pretty darn good.  I want someone else to admit that they too, enjoy the occasional lunch at the Lobster.  I will say that the decor isn't the classiest, with their lobsters and nets hanging on the walls...and the majority of the clientele is over 60, but that doesn't deter me.  The Lobster doesn't deserve its bad reputation. While it may not be the finest seafood restaurant in town, it sure ain't no Long John Silver's either."}
{"text":"We went there for valentine's day and couldn't make reservations.  We waited for an hr till we got seated, but boy was it worth the wait. The food was excellent,  great big portions of lobster. Great staff. I would definitely eat there again."}
{"text":"Ok, all done with Red Lobster for a good long while now.   Cheddar Bay biscuits no longer has the pull they once did, after this visit.   The 7 of us walked in on a Monday night and we were seated quickly. Host was friendly, waiter Jeremy was super nice and manager was all smiles.  What wasn't nice was the off-duty employee hanging out at the hostess station, getting employees to sign a card, while texting on her phone - totally oblivious to guests waiting to get to the hostess stand or that she was being loud and inappropriate. She looked like she was dressed for bed and hanging out at home, rather than a restaurant. I am surprised the manager didn't correct the spectacle.    Mr. Jeremy seemed like he was fast, as he raced around the room, but we waited a long time for drinks, food and refills.  It was pretty odd for an almost empty restaurant.  The Mojitos from the bar were really good though.  I used to love the mussels appetizer, but this visit they were awful.  I had the 4-course special. It had all I wanted.... if it was edible.  The shrimp skewer was still a bit raw.  The coconut shrimp was ok.  The rice under the uncooked shrimp wasn't cooked either, so I am glad I asked for a potato and they still gave me the rice.  I told Mr. Jeremy that the rice wasn't cooked and he was on to something else before I could tell him about the uncooked shrimp too.  With the larger party, I didn't want to make a fuss and I couldn't seem to get his attention without on. The caramel cheesecake dessert was tiny and looked like the swirled cheesecake you get from GFS or Sam's club. Eh.  My husband's steak was cooked nicely. Bill was still $80 for the two of us.   I think we'll spend that $80 elsewhere next time, so we can both eat our meals."}
{"text":"Young managers, Tony if that what you are; learn your art first do not Park in convenient parking spaces where your guest in park, Second ask what type of table they would like a booth or a regular table, you set the mood, you set the tone now it makes her bad dinner"}
{"text":"Food and service was great. Hostess was pleasant and very professional. We loved our server Zach, he was excellent and friendly. He went out of his way for us and we had one of the best customer services experiences. As always, food was amazing!   On another note, there were no lobsters in the aquarium which was a first for all the Red Lobsters we've been to. Also, they ran out of large to- go containers. Both were not a huge deal but something to note."}
{"text":"After speaking with Jessica, I appreciated how much she took the effort to ensure my seated reservation for my fiancée's 30th bday was important to me. She made sure I was penciled in and her professionalism definitely made me comfortable. Upon my arrival, I checked in with Nicole and after letting her know my name and my seated reservation, not only did she looked at me with confusion but she sent me to wrong seated reservation area under the impression that my party had already arrived. After I told her that my reservation was for 7 not anything before 7, so I definitely checked in early. She then told me with an attitude that \"we didn't have anything reserved for you\" I was completely upset after that remark! She then checked in her calendar and with her sarcastic remark she responds with \"oh I do see your name now, it's because the calendar was faced the other way, so I didn't know\" of course she didn't know which is why when I checked in, I would've appreciated that she paid attention to when I said my name, who I spoke to and what time my seated reservation was for! My table was not even ready and we were then told to wait until the rest of the party shows to be seated! Had I had known that disclosure, I would've told my entire party to be there at 6:45 when I arrived so we can at least sit down and have an appetizer. Check in was horrible! On the other hand, my waiter Harrison was very professional, respectful and funny. He tended to us with poise and responded to us quickly especially when it came to refilling our drinks, our bread and making sure my fiancées Birthday was special. The food was flipping awesome for my son, my fiancée and I but for my brother, the steak wasn't too pleasant. I would only go back if Harrison was there, other than that, I wouldn't because of the other downfalls I experienced"}
{"text":"Being a seafood lover I would have given this place an extra point if not for the long wait before we got our table . It is almost always crowded especially during the weekends . Anyways the food compensates for the crowd and lack of personal attention . We got ourselves the platter containing crab, shrimp , lobster and fish . Shrimps were absolutely delicious so were the lobsters . I did not like the crab as much . Overall a tasty seafood spot if you are willing to wait too long to taste them ."}
{"text":"We were here for All you can Eat Shrimp it was amazingly good! You get the biscuits which are sooo good..you also get a salad and veggies. The salad was delicious as well as the free appetizer we got which were mozzarella sticks. There were a lot of options for shrimp combinations, and we truly enjoyed ours. The food was nice and hot. Overall we had a good time but only 4 stars because the service coulve been a little better"}
{"text":"I ATTEMPTED to each at Red Lobster today.  And yes, it was a failed attempt.  We can file this under \"Andrea's Most Bizarre Food Adventures.\"  We walked in and approached the hostess stand.  Right away, we noticed that the hostess was preoccupied - she had taken a lobster out of the tank by the door and was letting a couple of little girls pet it.  It was kinda cute.  At first.  One by one, each waiter and waitress walked by the hostess stand to assure us that she would be with us shortly.  I don't know how you define \"shortly,\" but to me, shortly means a minute.  Maybe two.  I'm all for lobster advocacy or whatever you call petting a lobster.  However, I didn't want to PET the lobster.  I wanted to EAT the lobster.  That's kinda the point, ya know?  Otherwise this would be a petting zoo and it would be a whole different review, because they have the petting part down pat.  The eating part is another story.  Anyway, SEVEN MINUTES passed with no signs of the lobster-pawing abating.  Oddly enough, the little girls no longer seemed interested - they weren't petting anymore - they were just sitting there and twisting the hems of their sundresses.  Meanwhile, the hostess constantly readjusted the lobster's angle on the tray so she could pose the darn thing.  It was like crustacean \"Vogue\".  *Cue music*  The waiters and waitresses seemed increasingly concerned that we hadn't been helped yet, probably because the line at this point was out the door (it was at the peak of the lunch rush).  However, no one went out of his or her way to rectify the situation.  Looking at me with panic does not constitute \"fixing it.\"  Even as we turned and walked out the door with the audible huffs of other angry customers as our departing soundtrack, the petting continued with no signs of slowing.    Look, hostess lady... if you want to work with animals, it seems counterintuitive to work in an establishment that serves them on a plate.  The woman had an unnatural lobster fixation - nobody cops a feel on a crustacean for that long!  It was just weird, weird, weird.  If I want seafood, I surely won't be returning to Red Lobster.  As I type, I am sitting on the couch, eating a sloppy joe.  It's delicious, and I didn't have to watch someone caress a cow in the process."}
{"text":"So it's my first time ever going to Red Lobster and I must say that I'm pretty darn impressed. The quality of the food is a notch above a chain restaurant; however, you have to pay $5-$10 more than your average chain restaurant to get this quality. The alcoholic cocktails are amazing and the lobster pizza is a dish that's worth trying."}
{"text":"Second visit this year March 2016.  Eager for a lovely advertised lobster. Prices surprised me due to the high increase...$30 - $39 for a dish.  Settled for lunch of scallops and shrimp with baked potato..paid extra for a salad that was mainly iceberg lettuce and too cold. Shrimps were one skewer of undercooked and tasteless.  Tiny tiny scallops were sitting in water and tasteless.  Very big disappointment."}
{"text":"Came here for a late dinner and was told about the crab feast. I'm a huge fan of crabs, shrimp...seafood. Though this is a chain restaurant, the items specifically the Bairdi Crab Leg dinner was juicy, sweet and tastes just as good as home made."}
{"text":"CHEDDER BAY BISCUITS. I seriously come here mainly for the CBBs. Always delicious, and you can get an unlimited free supply of them. Just for one, it's 150 calories, but hey, 3 grams of protein!   The main entrees are good, too, because they are smothered in butter. If you are super health conscious, this place will make you break any and all your diets. I had their choose your two item dinner and got their new items - something fried shrimp and lobster pot pie with CBB shell. The shrimp was good, but of course, uber oily. The pot pie was tasty, but I was slightly disappointed that the CBB shell was only the top layer. I was hoping the whole pie would be CBB with the filling inside. Instead it was more like a soup with CBB layer on top. I also tried my boyfriends Mahi fish and shrimp dish, which was good. Noteably, the side dish steamed broccoli juiced out butter when you bit into it.  As for the establishment itself, it's how all Red Lobsters look - kinda dim. This location was clean and the staff friendly."}
{"text":"Came here with my wife on a Saturday evening. It was pretty packed and we waited a good 35 minutes before being seated.   The food was good and the server was excellant. The only problem was the food taking forever to delivered. Other then that, we enjoyed our time there and on to the next time we good there."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful lunch today and the service by Jenny C was amazing and even though the lobster tail was a bit chewy she replaced it with a steamed one & the cheddar biscuits were absolutely delicious and very fresh.  I ordered the shrimp linguini pasta and Mom had the trio with lobster,salmon and shrimp and everything was wonderful.  This place is also very clean and inviting too, the atmosphere is comfortable and quiet (it was a Sunday afternoon) can't wait to come back!!"}
{"text":"Our dinner was delicious, the service was wonderful and we were there on a Friday evening.  Three of us had dinner and wine.  The J. Gott Cabernet Sauvignon was delicious.  I had lobster and filet mignon and the meal was cooked to perfection.  We also had breaded shrimp which was also terrific.  Desirees was our server and she was AWESOME.  This was our second visit and both times were five star service and food.  Talapia dinner with butter and lobster sauce. Highly recommend!!!! It was more than enough food.  You got an entree, salad and two sides.. Plus their famous biscuits. Bar Harbor lobster bake was also delicious and recommended."}
{"text":"I friggin' love Red Lobster. The biscuits are delicious and there's something for everyone on the menu.  I've been eating at Red Lobster for years.  I love the Seaside Shrimp Trio and the Ultimate Feast and their chocolate lava cookie and carrot cake is sooo yummy.  I've even hauled my non-seafood eating family members to Red Lobster, as they have an extensive menu with lots of non seafood choices. Not too fancy, not too casual.  Eat here!  You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Other than the delicious cheddar biscuits, I find the service horrible and the food way over-priced. I ordered the 4-course meal. Soup & salad came out pretty quickly. They were OK. Not great/not awful. I wasn't even 1//4 of the way through either when the main course showed up. As a former server, there's no excuse for that. You watch the table and drop the order for the rest of the meal to approximately coincide with the customer finishing soup &/or salad. (And they weren't busy.) The waitress brought the check before bringing the dessert that is included in the 4-course meal. I had to ask for a refill of tea. The scallops in the linguine were the size of mini-marshmallows and poor quality. Sorry, but the cheddar biscuits aren't enough to bring me back. Las Vegas has many excellent choices for seafood and Red Lobster is not one of them."}
{"text":"Red Lobster is a pretty safe bed in terms of food. But for those allergic to dairy (butter, cream, cheese) it can be a nightmare. I don't have a problem however, asking for my dish to be made dairy free.   We were able to make a reservation for a Sunday afternoon. So I'm not sure why others weren't able to do that in years past. We came early at about 11.45am and the restaurant was pretty empty. Our server was Matt and he was good. We got all our drinks promptly and then some of our party needed time to decide on their mains so he left us to that. I ordered the salmon with squash and carrots (no glazing as that's dairy). My dish also came with a garden salad. The salmon was really good. Nicely cooked and tasted fresh. I wish I'd asked for the dinner portion as I still felt a little hungry afterwards.   By the time we were leaving the restaurant it was getting quite packed. Several large groups came in midway through our meal. We were glad we came early. This Red Lobster is smaller than the one on Warden & Sheppard but I don't mind that. They at least take reservations."}
{"text":"We went for lunch, Judy was our server. I decided to try something different .. The shrimp tacos. When they arrived I was overwhelmed! 3 large tacos and a serving of wild rice for $7.99. The tortillas were soft corn,, I believe there was either 3 or 4 perfectly prepared shrimp, pico de gallo. Fine shredded cabbage and a delicious light and ever so spicy sauce.. Thanks Judy for the terrific service!"}
{"text":"Super busy this Sunday for mother's day. We had to wait to get a table but didn't wait longer than 20 minutes. I had the captain's catch lunch size which was decent. The size of the fillets seemed small but I'll allow for that since it was a lunch proportion. The breaded shrimp was delicious the garlic shrimp tasteless without the butter. I can't have dairy so I asked for it done without butter. They just cooked it plain. They could have used oil & added garlic but they didn't. Seems lazy to me. Anyway, hubby & I had the chocolate chip lava cookie for dessert & my parents had the brownie for dessert. The dessert was underwhelming. Service was okay. Our waitress was all right. I'm going to be more lenient because it was super busy so perhaps the quality wasn't as great because of that."}
{"text":"I came to this location a few months ago with my mother. It was a very slow midweek afternoon. We both ordered the Ultimate Feast, which featured lobster tail so chewy I had to cut it with a fork and serrated knife. The breaded shrimp were soggy with grease.  I had a glass of lemon water. No matter how much lemon I squeezed in, I couldn't disguise the dirty taste. It tasted like what dirty bathrooms smell like. I thought maybe the ice machine needed cleaned or something. After a few sips, I ordered a pop instead. The following night,  I showed the first symptoms of what would be a week and a half of salmonella hell. I had to call off work and it was honestly atrocious. I never called to complain but I honestly should have for the sake of other patrons. I know it was the water because my mother had the exact same food and did not get sick.  Every time I've been back to this location over the past five years, it has been worse every time. Overly greasey and overly buttered, rubbery or underdone. One time a manager tried to tell us that scallops that were cold and slimy in the middle were done, yet he refused to touch or inspect them. The only upside is the very friendly staff."}
{"text":"service was excellent"}
{"text":"If you have Lobster in your name you better know how to cook one. Not only can this bunch cook lobster but if my meal was any indication, there is not much seafood they can't cook. My wife and I went to this restaurant knowing full well that it is a chain and not expecting much more than an \"OK\" meal. From the greeting at the door the the delightful waiter to the cheese biscuits all the way through dessert, the entire experience was stellar. We both got the lemon butter trio with lobster, scallops and shrimp, all grilled and each was perfectly cooked, no small feat, and sauced with a spectacular lemon butter concoction that put an already great meal over the top. The langostino baked potato was great too. For dessert we picked the trio of apple crostada, brownie with ice cream and cheesecake. the brownie and apple crostada were hot and the ice cream was cold and the cheese cake was perfect. Lunches don't get much better than this. I knocked off a star because I have a hard time giving any restaurant a perfect score and to be honest, the bill for lunch for 2 was over 90 bucks and we only drank water and didn't have an appetizer. But all in all it was at least a 4 1/2 star experience and we can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Our daughters Birthday, we had \"call ahead\" reservations and were seated quickly. It was our 36 year old daughters birthday and it was called to our staff members attention. Beverages were ordered. Draft beers took 20  min to arrive at the tables (and 3 requests). My wife and Daughter ordered \"lobster feast\" which required FOUR REQUESTS for Crackers. I requested a steak medium rare.... mine arrived WELL DONE. it was a complete train wreck. My food was sent back.... the ladies food became cold while they waited on Crackers. This was an awful experience. I was more disappointed when a manager did not come check on us once food started going back to the kitchen. WHY???? The wait staff blamed the bar, kitchen, anything she could do to keep blame off herself.... her other tables were behind as well... this wait staff member was clearly in the weeds. A manager needed to be involved....and to top it off ...we were not offered desert or a birthday song for our daughter... and the wait staff was very aware of the request. Poor experience.... needs much improvement."}
{"text":"YAHOO! Another $10 gift card from my credit card company...  So I decided to go back to the same Red Lobster and this time was even better than last.  So this was my adventure at Red Lobster again.  So I walked through the entrance of the place and WOW the host was right there expecting me with a menu.  I was shocked a chain restaurant has this kind of good service.  So I got promptly seated and the waiter came up and greeted me with a smile.  I got my usual water with lemon and ordered some peppercorn salmon dish.  The waiter was very professional and was extremely attentive.  I got my plate of food and cut into the salmon.  WOW! The salmon is cooked perfect? Perfect medium rare? I was just mind boggled how perfect the salmon was cooked.  99.9% of chain restaurant over cook the living crap out of everything and plus the quality of the products the restaurants get in aren't all that great.  So I ate my perfectly cooked salmon with some wasabi sauce, wild rice, and asparagus.  Oh by the way the asparagus was cooked perfect to.  I was just in complete shock ha.... So that was my meal and I left with my stomach full and a smile on my face.  Oh by the way the waiter offered me if I wanted more sauce for my salmon and a togo water... Now that's a plus... which means, more tip for him. =)"}
{"text":"\"Red Lobster Service Bad\"  We waited 15 minutes for the drinks and 30 minutes for the biscuits. The biscuits was hard. The salads was the next thing delivered to the table which we had exactly 2 minutes to eat before the main course was delivered. I don't recommend going to eat there ."}
{"text":"Waitress was very pleasant.  Food was mediocre.  Rest of staff was very unprofessional.  Watched a hostess try to seat a party and the waitress whose section it was in told him not to seat them there because she was too busy.  Kitchen staff and wait staff loitered by the register near our booth and Nigga this and Nigga that was all that came out of their mouths."}
{"text":"Our waitress was great. The lobster roll was fishy and the trout as well was fishy and old tasting. I usually like red lobster maybe just this location isn't as busy and has older fish."}
{"text":"Lobsterfest was awesome I loved the food but damn we got a server with no personality that just didn't want to be there. When I spend $115 on dinner for my girl and I, I expect the server to smile and seem happy. But not ours. Nope just dull and dimwitted. But food was excellent."}
{"text":"I can't believe I'm taking the time to write this, I never do, but damn... Red Lobster got it right tonight! I gotta rave about Red Lobster, Crabfest, Our Waiter James Z... everything was delicious and spot on. I haven't been there in years maybe, I remembered the Red Lobster on Flamingo not being so good, and couldn't figure out why they were so popular still. But now I get it. I literally don't even know what was my favorite, had the ultimate crab plate, I substituted the regular fried shrimp for coconut shrimp with that creamy piña colada sauce, and it literally changed my worldview.  We eat out a lot, and I sometimes feel like an amateur food critic, and when a place just nails everything, you want to celebrate them. Good job, Red Lobster, you won me back!"}
{"text":"If you like crap out of a can then this is the place for you! The crab does not taste authentic and taste like it came out of a sardine. The food is ok but not what I expected from Red Lobster. If you want some real Seafood this is not your place."}
{"text":"Worst service I have ever had. The waitress the first time I went was a little short, not personable. The second time about 2-3 months later was just awful. So slow, rude, forgetful and uncaring. I was there on a weeknight, for over 2 hours.  I just don't even know what to say. It made my whole experience disappointing.  I won't go back to this location."}
{"text":"Service was very slow for a Saturday lunch. The prices are outrageous for tiny lunch portions. The biscuits were hard and I had to ask for fresh ones...why do I need to ask for fresh ones??? Shouldn't they just be given?! Frustrating. Food was ok, nothing wrong with it."}
{"text":"Love sea food?  Love variety and getting more than your money's worth?  Then you need to check out Red Lobster.  It always has great service and meals that are filling and delicious. Be careful not to fill up in their garlic bread (they're so tasty) or you won't have to on for the entree.   I love the coconut shrimp and the fettuccine.  Oh and the clam chowder, stuffed mushroom caps and mozzarella sticks.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I imagine that after Joe's Crab Shack that Red Lobster would have stepped up their game but I unfortunately imagined wrong. The biscuits are still memorable, the staff are friendly and efficient but the mediocre seafood doesn't make up for it. I'd save my money unless you're starving as my most recent experience had the greatest wait staff but my plate was hotter than the food allowing me to believe it sat for a while. The scampi was oily, potatoes were cold and I can't fathom how any of this is good food. With so many options in Pittsburgh these guys have to step up their game. Keep the awesome staff but add some flavors to the food."}
{"text":"We have ALMOST always had good luck with this Red Lobster. We've eaten here probably a dozen times with wonderful service and food. Today was a bit of a letdown. Our waiter (Edwardo) gave us no time to pick our choices and then failed to return after we needed a few minutes. The food was only average, which was a disappointment.  Good thing is that i talked to the manager and she made things right, so we will go back and get a different waiter."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Red Lobster to try the endless shrimp promotion they were having. We made a huge mistake...  To be clear- this review has absolutely nothing to do with the staff- they were all very courteous and nice. This review strictly has to do with the \"Endless Shrimp\" experience.  There were only 5 or 6 kinds of shrimp available at this location for the endless shrimp deal. The pineapple habanero, fettuccine linguine shrimp, and coconut shrimp bites were the tiny kinds of shrimp used in shrimp salads- about the size of a quarter each, HUGELY disappointing...the fried shrimp, teriyaki shrimp, and the shrimp scampi were the only items that used shrimp that came close to the size of actual shrimp and not plankton or shrimp larvae, which is what the other items seemed like.  The truly maddening part of this experience is not Red Lobster's attempts to fill you up with biscuits, salad, cole slaw, etc...that's to be expected and that's up to each diner, whether they choose to fill up on other things. Can't blame RL for that. What I did not appreciate was that they do not let you put in more than 2 orders at a time, and they make sure to make you wait about 15 mins or so in between each order of shrimp just for added assurance that you'll fill up sooner, and on less shrimp...again, not our server's fault, I know it's just what they tell her to do. We ended up eating 191 shrimp between the two of us, as we felt compelled to get our money's worth given RL's shamelessly overt attempts to cut corners on this offer. There will not be a second time for endless shrimp for us, for how much they charge and how they limit your orders, it's totally not worth it. Most of the night was spent waiting for the next round of shrimp, as we crushed each order in about 45 seconds, and then spent the next 15 minutes waiting for more food...  The last thing that was irritating was the \"suggested tip\" calculations, where it includes the tax for the tip. Not many people understand the rigors of the job that these servers go through, as my husband and I have both worked in similar capacities. But consumers are the ones paying the tax- we shouldn't have to tip on the taxes well..."}
{"text":"Good Food. We tried their Poke and their Lobster/Shrimp Rolls for a Starter and they were awesome! The only thing was that my wife found a bit of plastic in her Broccoli...they apologized and gave us a discount and the whole thing but it was a bit unsettling"}
{"text":"Service was great. Food was great. Huge portions, except I got ripped off on the amt of fries they gave.   Lots of refills on those tasty buns. Yum!   I would recommed this location!"}
{"text":"Good food, bad service.   Good service in a restaurant chain is really hard to find. Their cookie cutter food recipe is mostly awesome. Tables are not sturdy and hostess was unimpressed when I asked to switch tables.   It doesn't take much to smile when customers are inconvenienced right? Right?   The biscuit? Yum! The pasta? Double yum. Shrimps? Hail to the shrimps! The food compensated for the lousy service. The servers wanted to kick us out after a while. The more people in restaurants the better.   Overall, I felt I was just a number. A customer for that day and maybe not for life."}
{"text":"For me, a 5 star review for a chain restaurant is only given when the service is exceptional. This was absolutely the case this past Friday at Red Lobster. Given it was a Friday, there was a bit of a wait, but very worth it in the end. We were seated in Heather's area. She was incredibly pleasant the entire meal. Very accommodating, never far away. Figuring she was just an anomaly, i tried listening in on the neighbouring tables and the service they were given. Across the board, employees were providing amazing customer service, pleasant conversation and suggesting meals. Red Lobster must have rolled out a very excellent training program in recent years, as I have never encountered such amazing service at a location before.   The food was what I expected from Red Lobster. Delicious, fried and with a side of biscuits. Beyond anything else, the food was PIPING HOT! So fresh. A real stand out meal, that I was not expecting at all."}
{"text":"Took my wife and daughter on the evening of 11/1/16. Although the restaurant was littered with empty tables we had to wait almost 10 minutes to be seated. We had to wait even longer for our drinks. The mashed potatoes were hard obviously not fresh and the grilled shrimp was cold. The first time I've ever had a bad experience at a Red Lobster and the last time we visit this location."}
{"text":"The staff at this location is mistreated and the management needs an overhaul, I saw the manager fire this poor girl and yelled at her in front of the customers because she brought the wrong order to the wrong table. I can understand cutting someone loose because they can't do the job but to yell at them in front of the customers is another thing. I will never return to this location for the rest of my life."}
{"text":"Great job!  The rainbow trout was dynamite, the Cheddar Bay biscuits predictably good, good service, they listened and didn't put cucumbers on my salad, the rice pilaf was tender and not hard, the beans were good, the service was good...  ...Having been a waiter I am brutal when thing aren't right, and here things are right.  Good job."}
{"text":"So disappointing since I truly generally enjoy red lobster. This location though....uggggg.  Food tasteless and dry. Service sporadic.  Dirty and generally on the level of a Denny's."}
{"text":"Had dinner with my daughter.  Our server was Angel.  He was very attentive and professional.  I empty my glass pretty quick and he was always there to refill it.  I had the Bar Harbor Lobster Bake.  It was excellent.  Hot, fresh and tasty.  The lobster was probably the best I've ever had.  It filled me up!  My daughter had the kids Snow Crab, which she loved also.  My only complaint was being seated next to the server computer stations which had extremely high traffic and a bit more noise than I would have liked.  Ask for Angel for your server if you visit!"}
{"text":"My first visit to this location. Like any typical Friday night you have to wait for a table. Once seated we were served fast & received good service. Would re-visit this location."}
{"text":"Ordered Lobster Lovers Dream for 2 but neither of us like broccoli. Why always undercooked broccoli, RL? I exchanged for green beans (not fresh) & daughter asked for asparagus & they charged 2.99 extra! I'm diabetic so now I can't order the sweet cocktails or sugary desserts. How about a fresh fruit offering or sugarless ice cream for dessert, RL? Ordered seafood stuffed mushrooms, but they've changed the recipe. Hardly any seafood, cheese melted in the dish instead of mushroom. A disappointment. The 3 stars are for their always great lobster, crab legs and shrimp. Other things need a little work."}
{"text":"There were employees loitering around the front entrance smoking and there were crumbs on the table we sat at. I definitely don't reccomend this specific Red Lobster."}
{"text":"How long had it been since last I dined at a Red Lobster? 2004, my 30th (gasp!) birthday, at the only Red Lobster I had ever been to; the one in West Mifflin. Throughout childhood, the West Mifflin satellite was a semi-regular destination for the family, but as I got older, visits became less frequent.   Enter: Kay's Aunt. Kay's aunt gets her a $25 gift card as an Easter present. Kay hugs her. I hug her also. This past Sunday, coming back home from Beaver Falls, we decide to unload said gift card as it was boring a hole through her wallet and purse.   I knew I wanted lobster, but how? I wanted to save a bit of cash as well, maximizing the gift card, and it was early afternoon, lunch time.   Man how I've pined for lobster rolls ever since I saw a television special that dedicated a segment to them. Never did I think a chain restaurant would sell them. Once I saw them on the menu, I wanted nothing else.   The lobster inside the somewhat small, buttered, toasted buns (you get 2 to an order) is dressed with a touch of mayo and a small amount of diced celery and onion.   I really hope Subway doesn't start selling these. I mean, they'll figure out a way to make it lame. Or they'll use langostinos.   I do however hope that more local, indy joints will begin have them on their menus. An almost perfect lunch, the chilly lobster yielded to my teeth easily,  the mayo and veggies gave each sandwich a fresh, crisp taste, and the warm rolls provided for that magical cool/hot contrast. Excellent deli fare, I could have eaten a quartet of these, again, never expecting Red Lobster to serve up their namesake in such a manner.   The fries that came with it (subbing for potato chips since I don't want to order potato chips at a Red Lobster) were typical shoestring tater sticks that performed their function satisfactorily.   Kay swore by the Peach-Bourbon BBQ Scallops, so that became our starter.  Each scallop was bundled in a bacon scarf, all of them on a skewer atop a bed of thin onion rings and pico de gallo. 4 to an order, Kay and I fought over the sweetly charred, juicy, plump scallops and scavenged for the dead perfect breaded hoops of allium and refreshing pico de gallo.   What happened to the Fudge Overboard? No matter. In its place is the Warm Chocolate Chip Lava Cookie, a tart/cookie hybrid that bleeds debauched fudge when broken open. Only a lone scoop of vanilla ice cream serves to cut its savage sweetness and soothe its volcanic heat.   Catherine, our personable server, was truly on her game on this day, despite her astonishment at how fast we ate everything. We were starving! Catherine missed not one beat. Refills came before we thought of them, courses were paced flawlessly, specials were explained deftly, all with a smile.   Raise a claw for The Crimson Crustacean!   It's the best microwaved seafood you'll ever nosh on.   P.S. As I went for the complimentary, fattening, and addictive cheddar biscuits, Kay outed herself as a Boondocks fan. A sense of geeky humor she has."}
{"text":"When I was a child, my parents brought my sister and I here every so often for what we thought back then to a be a feast of feasts. Since then Red Lobster has lost her luster with increased independent competition and a sharpening of tastes, but sadly enough, old RL is still as good or better than some non-chains. She even matches nearby seafood restaurant Baltimore House in quality.  Why the hell did we come here? Sentimentality. I hadn't been to this Red Lobster in 10 years.  No, that's not really why we came. Well, partly. I hadn't Yelped it yet!  Kay's grandmother in Texas mailed us a $50 gift card for Darden group franchises. I'd already been to Bahama Breeze and Olive Garden (well, the one out here in West Mifflin, but that was 10 years ago...), AND we have no Seasons 22 in our metro area, so to the Cardinal Claw we came. There's the truth, spilled out onto the floor. Page the janitor.   A decent supper was had, and the service was more than that, our waiter accommodating us comfortably and unhurriedly despite our arrival 75 minutes before closing.   RL's food isn't inedible at all even though I've heard rumors, particularly through a co-worker who claims he used to work for the chain, that 80% of their menu is flash-frozen and merely re-heated. When I heard of this -- and to me it's highly plausible -- I immediately knocked my rating of the Robinson RL down a peg or two.   For $24.50, the Wood-Grilled Lobster, Shrimp and Scallops gets you a mighty hearty helping of oceanic critters to munch on, and while I wasn't in a reverie over any of it, it was all juicy, and when dunked into that clarified butter, hell I couldn't have cared less where it was caught. My hunger probably also allowed me to enjoy this more than I normally would have.   Our server was so honest, when I really wanted to splurge on a live lobster, he just pointed me to the aforementioned entree, saying \"Dude, this is cheaper. Maximize your gift!\"  Combine that with an acceptable side of slaw, a baked potato, those opiate-laced cheddar bay biscuits (don't eat too many), and a solid opener in the Lobster Artichoke dip (complete with freshly fried tortilla chips), and I really feel like I'd be a    cur if I gave them anything less than a 3. RL passes, not with streamers aloft, but she passes.   And if I gave them anything more than a 3, I'd hate myself.  Nostalgia only goes so far.   P.S. We were honestly so stuffed, we didn't even consider dessert."}
{"text":"Gave them another opportunity.  Called first to make sure lobsterfest was still going on. After getting there and waiting 25 minutes to be seated when ordering, some of the Lobsterfest items weren't available.  The server went and got the manager. She came to our table with an attitude and wanted to argue with use. I told her I would contact the corporate office. She just waved her hand at use and walked away.  After she left, we left also. It's obvious why Darden Restaurants sold them off. Given them too many chances. I'm done with Red Lobster."}
{"text":"Muy buen servicio, muy buena atención, la comida muy buena y sierren bastante. Lugar limpio. Y la langosta muy buena, igual que siempre."}
{"text":"Red Lobster?  This choice was made strictly to cap off a day of nostalgia for certain members of our party.  We expected to enjoy the camp factor; what we didn't expect was the hordes of people there.  I had no idea that a Saturday night around 8:15 pm would be so damn busy!  We were told our wait was going to be one hour and ten minutes.  I wanted to go else where, but everyone else wanted to stick it out.  Finally, over an hour later we got our table.  Our server, although very polite, clearly had too much going on and it took forever to get drinks and food.  I ordered the Seaport plate - a lobster tail, two kinds of shrimp, some rice, and broccoli.  I also had a salad and a biscuit.  Everything was extremely salty and bland.  The best thing about this experience was the wine prices - only $7 per glass for a serviceable red.  Otherwise, everything else was overpriced for what it was.  I heard two birthdays being celebrated at nearby tables.  It reminded me that the only other time I've been to the Lobster since childhood was celebrating a relative's birthday too.  Then I had a similar thought.  Why with all the interesting restaurants in Toronto, is this place still so popular?"}
{"text":"What a wonderful atmosphere and our server, Heather, just great. Most of us are from Montana and unfortunately here for our fathers passing. The food was amazing and since we are without a Red Lobster at home we had to stop. Heather you made the trip better without knowing that we were. In town for a tragedy, thank you!"}
{"text":"My husband and I love Red Lobster! If my husband picks the restaurant, Red Lobster is almost always his choice. The artichoke seafood dip is so yummy! Plus we love the biscuits and snow crab legs! They are even nice enough to make me a special virgin version of their triple berry sangria. Yum!"}
{"text":"Carry out service at red lobster is TERRIBLE! Called and was told it would take 20-30 minutes. I showed up 35 minutes later and then waited another 30 minutes before my food was finally ready. To top it all off it was cold when they have it to me."}
{"text":"We visited Friday for lunch. The lunch portion of the Fettuccine Alfredo with Shrimp was fairly good, but left a strange after taste. The sauce was excellent, but the shrimp tasted odd. The acoustics in the restaurant were fairly poor. We could hear full conversations on both sides of us. There were lots of screaming children at lunch, which was unnerving. The biscuits were fantastic, as always. Pricing is very high for lunch and we won't be going back because of this. The server was very distracted and spent the time with another table, where her friend was. This was poor service and coupled with the noise level, a true turn-off."}
{"text":"The Ultimate Feast is my go to entree! It seems to always be in season which I find reliable! Appetizers are good as well. I order the Lobster Artichoke Dip. It's served with colored tortilla chips. Dining with a fun accent, Nice touch y'all! Service has been great my few visits. Clean area with clean restrooms. No wifi available but the chatter in the spot will make you want to chit chat on your own. It's quite pleasant really. I enjoyed my time here and I will be returning. Good job!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Red Lobster in the city!! Mohagane is a great server! She made my experience great and was so enthusiastic! The atmosphere was great and the music wasn't too loud. The lighting was pleasant as well. Food was fresh and the bill was the usual price I pay at other Red Lobster Establishments.  Pros: Clean establishment Good atmosphere Enthusiastic Staff Clean restrooms Fresh food  Cons: None at the moment  Thanks for the great dining experience Mohagane! You're amazing! Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"Very good food and service. We arrived early at 5:30 and were seated after a short wait. I had wild sockeye salmon and my wife had sirloin steak and snow crab legs. All were cooked perfectly. The service was polite and prompt. Will come back again"}
{"text":"Service started out well enough. We asked about a gift card we were going to use here just to be on the safe side. As soon as that was seen our service nearly stopped completely. I even had to walk up to the bar to get helped.  Our waitress Morgan went from a 9 to a 1 with one look at a gift card. I usually tip 30% plus for great service no matter the gift card or not in cash. That way they can choose to claim it on taxes or not. Thankfully the other servers took potty on both of here tables. The second table also had to get help from the bar. Very sad service.   Started with the seaside sampler. Jumbo shrimp cocktail was outstanding.  Fresh crisp shrimp. Coconut Shrimp was fried perfectly. The Shrimp lobster mushrooms were good and tastey.  Wife ordered the Ultimate feast and I the Lobster Lovers plate. 1/2 of our food was very good. The rest mostly lobster was left sitting under a heat lamp way too long. it had hardened on top to a leathery consistency.  My wifes potatoes was delivered dry with a big rotten spot on it. Yummy.   Service a 1 food a 3."}
{"text":"Came for my Birthday! Got the Seafood Trio..very good Shrimp Linguini. I had never tried it before! Had a very good waitress Ambyr. Food was excellent..tho prices have gone up looks like! Got a free dessert"}
{"text":"It's been awhile since I've been to Red Lobster and I'm sad to report that it is still sub par and to be skipped. Of ALL the hundreds of restaurants in Charlotte, a friend chose Red Lobster for her birthday dinner. So there I was at RL. I ordered the lobster tacos with sweet potatoes and a Caesar salad for my side. The Caesar salad was basic. Given that this is a seafood restaurant, where are the anchovies. Some cracked pepper would've helped. That being said, it was an average appetizer caesar.   The real disappointment came in the entree. My lobster tacos were TERRIBLE. I thought that the order wasn't ours because the lobster looked like a few pieces of fried shrimp. Then to bit in and not taste lobster, just overwhelming salty sauce was such a let down. The sauce overpowered the little bit of lobster that was there. I ended up getting a fork and eating the lobster before the other taco filling to hope to taste some lobster. And mind you, there was very little lobster. NOTHING like the fresh chunks you see in the picture. FALSE ADVERTISING! I should write corporate.  The worst part of dinner were the whipped sweet potatoes with honey roasted pecans. It came out drowning in butter and was actually salty. I asked the waitress for the side without butter. It came out, no obvious butter on top. BUT still way too salty. The butter was just mixed not slathered on top. This let me know there are NO whole sweet potatoes in the back. Just a puree that's shipped in and heated up. Gross.  Service was very kind and came out to sing happy birthday to my friend. She enjoyed her meal. She had the wood grilled salmon, shrimp, and lobster. It was fine. And I suppose because it was her birthday that her happiness is what mattered. As for me I will not be returning anytime soon or this lifetime by choice."}
{"text":"So disappointed I brought my girlfriend to dinner and there is a sign on door saying that they are not taking cards or credit cards or gift cards due to there machine down and it won't be fixed all day. How can you run a restaurant like this??? What upsets me more is that I called in to set up reservations and no one told me nothing!!!!We don't live down the street!! I  was so ready to make my date night great, and surprise her with some lobster and shrimp. Thanks red lobster for killing my dinner plans!!"}
{"text":"It really seems like this location has really stepped up their customer service. Everyone was really friendly and very attentive. The food was great like always definatly live this location the restaurant is always clean def one of the best in town!"}
{"text":"Good for a night out.  The lobster lovers dream was great, but it was a lot of food.  The biscuits, salad, and drinks were delicious as well.  The best thing about this location was the service...we lucked out and got a really good server.  The service made the entire experience nice."}
{"text":"The food here is just awful, when my plate arrived from the \"seafood experts\" my lobster was so dry and it looked super old, tasted like it had been in the freezer for 6 months and then cooked in the microwave, ugh. and my shrimp was soggy like oatmeal, the biscuits were super good. The service was way to much, there were about 6 customers and about 8-10 servers in the restaurant and the servers didn't  have stations so every minute you'd have a server coming by asking you the same question 4 other people just asked us...sooo annoying, our waiter chris was a nice guy and a good server but he messed with customers heads alittle to much, saying jokes that made us feel rude that we didnt laugh because we didnt understand what he was talking about, but when he asked how my food was and i said \"gross\" he was like \"ohhh you should of told me i'd get the manager for you right now if you want\" i said \"no i'll go to arbys down the street but thank you\" he was saying that i should just talk to the manager and take care of it but at that point i just wanted to get out of that place.In walkes a single mom with 5 little kids with her and they sat them right next to us, the mother of the kids actually said to the server \"my kids are loud maybe we should sit somewhere else\" then looked and me, i just smiled because it was true and i really appreciated her being thoughtful of others, so the server says \"ohh no this is fine\" luckly the kids were not that bad at all, phew.  The host was just a freak, he was staring at us the entire time we were in the restaurant and wouldnt even look away when we stared back at him like \"whaaaaaat\" ???? then some other server or hostess came by with our bill and said \"for your convenience\" which i wanted to say \"it's not \"convenient\" to pay 100 bucks for the worst seafood ever\"!!!  (but i didnt i just wanted to escape and fast) so she fails to give me a pen, so i see the host walking by and i say to him \"do you have a pen\"? and he says \"not on me\" and pats his pockets, then a server came by and said \"ohhh i have one\"..I looked at my partner and said \"NOT ON ME ? ARE YOU KIDDING?  so walking out the door two girls held the doors for us with smiles and have a good day blah blah blah, so as we are leaving right outside the door is a huge pile of trash so we actually had to step over and into trash \" well we thought it was over, then (yes there's more) we were stuck in our car for 5 minutes while two other cars sat behind us arguing about something, it was just so amazing how bad it was. We finally escaped shaking our heads and laughing about how we fly all the way to vegas and one of our dinner plans was going to be red lobster, what a joke! we will never eat there again....grossss! p.s. we tipped chris big because it wasnt his fault....."}
{"text":"The parking lot was packed, but we didn't have to wait to be seated. The waitress was friendly and very helpful. The food was pretty good, a little overpriced maybe. Overall a good experience."}
{"text":"Hostess were horrible. The place is really run down and kinda dirty. Server was ok. Food was good. They definitely need to step up their game."}
{"text":"Waited over an hour for a bowl of clam chowder... not crowed in here at all.  sad service."}
{"text":"Great service    It was fast and friendly.   The finished plates were removed fast.  The food was prompt and hot.  The only thing was the broccoli was .... mushy.  We prefer a slight crunch or firmness but it was the consistency of mashed potatoes.   Other than that perfect lunch, Lobster Lovers & key lime pie."}
{"text":"I like the dank lighting but always feel yuk afterwards. Hard to rate a chain place but as RLs go it is ok."}
{"text":"Red Lobster has always had a special place in my heart when it comes to commercialized restaurants. Maybe it's the nostalgia of going there with my late Grandma, or the unending biscuits, but no matter what the reason, Red Lobster does a fine job of carrying everything from healthy, protein based dishes to fried, fun meals. Whether I've ordered a steak in the past, or ate endless shrimp recently, the food has never disappointed. I've gone to Red Lobster when I'm on a diet and when I'm not on a diet and every time staff was very helpful, friendly and catered to my dietary needs! Most recently, I went to enjoy the endless shrimp and was amazed at how you can change you selection of shrimp as often as you want and get truly unlimited food... all for $17. My family and I switched off different shrimp. We tried the tempura, garlic shrimp, grilled/plain shrimp, popcorn shrimp, hand breaded shrimp, and shrimp alfredo. The tempura was not very flavorful. It came with a ginger dressing, which added flavor, but my go to was the popcorn shrimp. Red Lobster seasons the breading with a similar seasoning that they use on the biscuits. I did try the grilled shrimp, which was also very good- fresh and light. The garlic shrimp and hand breaded (tail on) I wasn't crazy about. Endless shrimp is by far worth the money you spend. You have not lived until you have tried endless shrimp at least once! You start off with a big plate of shrimp and 2 sides, you can continue to order sides with your shrimp orders! As for the restaurant and service as a whole- definitely an A grade. The ambiance is great- dimly lit, spacious in between booths and a subtle hint of nautical flare! The bathrooms are always clean and staff is always helpful and friendly. I have been and continue to be a Red Lobster fan, I am always satisfied with all aspects of the restaurant!"}
{"text":"The service is consistently good the lunch portions and prices are reasonable the food quality is tasty and good unfortunately they do not offer a happy hour and the adult drink prices are to Expensive Especially a bottle of wine"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying every time I come to this location I have amazing customer service. Secondly, the food is well priced for the portion size. I love their complementary biscuits (don't taste as yummy the following day). I always get the same thing (build your own combo): garlic shrimp, coconut shrimp with piña colada dipping sauce (amazing heavenly goodness) and shrimp Alfredo with a side of mash potatoes and a Caesar to start. My meal usually comes up to 30 bucks, like who is complaining!? Ill admit they don't have the best Alfredo I've ever tried but I still like it."}
{"text":"Great food.  Always consistent.  Very tasty.  We pick up the orders.   Pickup has been at the bar.  Sometimes one does not know if the bartender is busy or the food is not ready.  The bartenders need to let the customer know the status of the order.  If it is still being cooked, that is fine.  If the bartender is not managing to at least connect with the kitchen, then management needs to review the the communication process between the bartender and the kitchen.  Perhaps the bartenders need to be aware that they have two priorities, serving drinks and taking care of takeouts.  Both are of equal importance and communication to both guest needs deserve the same treatment.  May I commend the reception attention as one walks in.  The guest is rapidly greeted and ready to direct them to what their express needs are.  A few times we paid in the reception area.  Recently we were redirected to the bar.  Perhaps this is a seasonal change since  the summer months are very busy and the lobby can get congested.  I am not really sure of the change.  If the bar is very busy, then there is more competition to get even the waitress's attention.  However, the food is worth this small, needed refinement.  Go Yelp!"}
{"text":"We ordered Togo and the food was very greasey and they did not include one of our sides for both dishes. The waitress also had an attitude throughout the service with us. I could've understood if they were busy but only 5-8 of the tables were filled."}
{"text":"First time at red lobster... Waitress was Linda and she was absolutely amazing! She went above and beyond and made amazing conversation with my boyfriend and I! The food was good but linda will definitely be the reason I go back!"}
{"text":"The Scottsdale location is one of the better Red Lobster's out there...  Had dinner here last night. Ordered a platter with three different kinds of shrimp, and all of them were good - but nothing to get overly excited about. A solid meal with good service for $25.  No waiting either, the place was slow at dinner time."}
{"text":"OMG. Another chain-restaurant review? Yep.  I don't always feel like driving 50+ miles for a meal...so when the GF showed up 30 minutes late from work due to traffic...I thought a little treat would be nice...so off to \"The Metrocenter\" for some seafood!  First off, I gotta give 'em kudos for a few things:  They have a clean lobster tanks separated into 3 size categories. Pick yer lobster, if you like. (Kids love this) The place is clean and inviting. The staff is efficient. Waiting areas are abundant and comfortable - should be no problem unless they are getting hammered with walk-ins that day.  Yeah, it's a chain. A chain that offers seafood and LIVE MAINE LOBSTER FROM THE TANK in the MIDDLE OF THE DESERT. Whatcha want? 1-1/4pounder or a 3 pounder? They have it. Go look at it cruising around the tank before you order it!  Anyway - we went for Lobsterfest - we covered the bases. Calimari, fried shrimp, sauteed shrimp, scampi, crab legs (Snow - not King), shrimp stuffing, crab stuffing, and 3 Maine tails plus cocktails and beer between us - all for less than a hundred bucks. Try to do that anywhere else in the Valley.  Service was fast, polite and effective. The ambiance was nice, and the air temp was very comfy; since the days are 85 and nights are 55 right now - they did a good job picking an inside temp.  NONE of the food (including the calamari) was overcooked, or rubbery. That's saying a lot when you look at what we ordered.   Couldn't think of a better way to spend a Thursday dinner without driving a zillion miles. We'll be back."}
{"text":"It was my first time here and I had a great time! Staff was so friendly and attentive, and the food was amazing. I had the shrimp combo and some iced tea, it was awesome. Also gave us many bread rolls to take home. I will be returning!"}
{"text":"I don't usually rate chain restaurants because they are usually pretty consistent with their food. Red lobster is red lobster. You can always expect it to taste the same.   I am rating because our server Stephanie was excellent. She was very attentive, always had our drinks filled and even brought a water for our 10 month old baby. Our baby unfortunately made a mess but she reassured us that it happens quite often. She is so pleasant.   Great job in recruiting Stephanie."}
{"text":"Long, long wait time every time we come here, but well worth the wait.  Delicious FOOD! love the free cheese bread.  Always satisfied everytime we eat here. Only 4 stars because of slow wait time and no reservations."}
{"text":"All food are way too salty, Chowder taste like can food, lobster super salty, biscuit too salty. Really bad service. As when we order a chowder and it wasn't been place in and when we ask Server that bring up food, he gave me a really bad attitude and ask if we want cup or bowl. Totally not worth of second try. Shrimp for linguine was so tiny, way smaller than other red lobster store. When my friend placed a order and want to change the something add in within 5 minutes she refused to change the order for my friends and said \"I already place the order I can't make any change for you\". I won't ever come back again. If I can rate yelp with 0 I will."}
{"text":"Visited this location for the first time on New Year's Day and was not disappointed. Starter biscuits are amazing - fluffy and salty. Fiancee enjoyed her cod and veggies and I enjoyed my shrimp tacos. Waitress was friendly and quick!"}
{"text":"The endless shrimp promotion is amazing!!!   This was my first time ever visiting a red lobster. I grew up on the coast, so when we wanted seafood red lobster was never a place that came to mind. That is until they announced their endless shrimp promotion! I love shrimp, so I figured if there was ever a good time to give red lobster a try this would be it. The service was pretty standard and comparable to any big chain restaurant, not outstanding but good. Now I can't comment on some of the other food they offer at red lobster but that endless shrimp promotion was amazing! They start you off with biscuits and a side salad. Then the entrée is any two types of shrimp and two sides. Now, at this point I was pretty full but being the shrimp lover that I am I had to keep muscling down more. Every few minutes our server would come over and ask what we wanted to try next and as advertised, the shrimp were endless they just kept bringing out more.  At the end of the meal, we had three boxes of leftover food to bring home! If stuffing your face like this wasn't such a health hazard, I would be there every night."}
{"text":"This location on yonge street was good. Fast service and good food. The only thing Saskatchewan a delay in getting the bill, but it was late and we were a distant corner seat. Didn't bother us to much.   Bread was to die for. Had the fish and chips, couldn't go wrong."}
{"text":"I always like red lobster, and I had a craving.  The location was clean when I entered and the staff was attentive as soon as they saw me come in. They sat me quickly, but it was mid-day and they weren't busy.  Within a few minutes, the server came and brought me bread right away (YES, LOVE THAT STUFF) and we had a chuckle about it. She told a story that if it were up to her, it would be her regular diet, but she actively has to avoid it cause it would be a slippery slope to become a bread monster.   I got a beer and fish and chips which were pretty standard, filled me up nicely.  Its a standard RL, however, I have seen some bad ones. This one is not one of them."}
{"text":"You know how I basically feel about the national chains....I have no use for them whatsoever.  And RL, you are a bottom dweller.   I reluctantly gave this one a go (Strongsville, OH) and won't be back. The lobster bisque is something I try whenever available...it is a bellweather selection for my interests. You have to know what you are doing to get this right..theirs was mediocre and no sherry available to add.. Nuff said.   The entrees (a variety of shrimp selections) were overcooked...DOA.  Embarrassing really. The salads were just icebug lettuce (c'mon, really? In this day and age?) The one ceasar selection was also comprised of...Iceburg lettuce!!  Sad.  My group was so disappointed that we swore a blood oath to never venture here again. I really don't want to waste any more time here so simply put..DON'T GO."}
{"text":"It was a tough week so we decided to eat somewhere out of the ordinary. It was my 3rd visit ever to a Red Lobster. I don't eat seafood, so the biggest draw for me is the cheddar bay biscuits (although we can make them at home with the box mix). Normally I would order a chicken or pasta dish in this situation, but I thought I'd try something different and went with the Peppercorn Sirloin, well done, with garlic mashed potatoes and green beans. My dinner was good, but not amazing. If I had planned on ordering steak I guess I'd have gone somewhere like Longhorn Steakhouse. Not an inexpensive meal, but very filling. The staff was friendly here. We also got carrot cake and cheesecake to go. They were yummy."}
{"text":"We had a group of 16 and were given great service for my Mom's birthday dinner. We had 2 waitresses and they didn't miss anything. Good food and great service."}
{"text":"I have to give this place 5 stars not necessarily because of the amazing tasting food, but because of the service of this place. People's opinion of Red Lobster is usually hit or miss; either people love the food or they don't. Personally I love the food. Being a franchise this place will have food that tastes like any other Red Lobster, so service is what separates the restaurants.  Our baseball team goes every year to pig out on AYCE shrimp. With 9 people going, most of them eating all the shrimp they can, it can be pretty demanding on the waiters. Although we had to wait for about 30 mins to get a table because they don't take reservations, I'm willing to overlook that.  With such a large party, there were 2 waiters assigned to our table, and they kept the shrimp and refill drinks coming to the very end.  It even got to the point where they were bringing out shrimp dishes even if we didn't order them because they knew they would have to at some point. There were no unusually long waits in between shrimp deliveries and the food coming out was hot and fresh.  Approximately 825 shrimp later the feast was finished and a grand time was had by all.  Word of warning; Every time I've been to this place there is always a lineup. It seems to start between 6 and 7 so be ready to wait if you go."}
{"text":"Went in today for my birthday lunch at an early 1pm, it was not very crowded & was sat down quickly. Filth encrusted menus we were both given! Then the wait....waited 20 min for glasses of water to be dropped off. (She says, \"fresh biscuits coming out so I will bring you some in a sec!\". Never got any). Then another 15 min later the waitress comes back to ask for our food order...then after she asks if we want any kind of beverage besides the water we got in dirty glasses! People & people were filtering in and placing orders for their meals & our order was still not even taken! A while later I reluctantly ordered at my friends insistence it would be good food. We were told biscuits were about to come out bc they were out & we never got those either. Yes twice told we'd get biscuits we never received, and we were starving!  She then took the order of a family  that just sat down behind us less than 2 min before us (35 min after we were seated), and was taking so long that 10 min after our order was given to her....she still had the slip in her hand bc she was concerned with the big family ordering behind us. Not a beverage other than water, no cheddar bay biscuits. 45 min after we were seated & waitress STILL all consumed with larger order behind. So on the way out the door, I said \"you can cancel our order\". Snotty & callous I get the response \" are you serious?\". Mind you....nothing had been even sent back as far as any kind pf order STILL!!   Never going back! Place was filthy & employees uncaring about much of anything!"}
{"text":"Gosh darn it last nights meal sucked!!!  My sis came in from out of town to celebrate Mother's day with me.  She brought my little niece who we were also celebrating her birthday.  We told server upon getting our drinks that it was my nieces birthday and would like dessert for her after dinner.  My sis had actually been to a Red Lobster the night before across town with some other family.  It was so enjoyable, she decided to order the same thing.  The mussel appetizer as an entree and shrimp cocktail.  She found the night before that she enjoyed dipping the bread in the delish broth of the mussels, as well as the mussels.  There was no broth.  She asked if she could get some more broth and instead the server brought her a bowl of garlic butter...My sis doctored it up by ordering extra lemon wedges, salt and pepper...it was edible then. When the orders came, my nieces and my sisters came.  I waited patiently for mine and after about 10 minutes and their food was getting cold waiting on me, I chose to call the server, who, btw was very sweet.  I didn't even have to say anything and she saw I had no meal.  She said that she would go and find my lost meal.  About another 10 minutes and she brought it.  Let me mention that this was a Saturday night about 7pm...and it was not very busy (maybe shoulda been a sign)  All of my food (I ordered the $26 Ultimate Feast) was cold.  Ugh...My ceasar salad was disgusting... They brought bill but forgot her bday dessert...we mentioned it (we were trying to be sneaky so it would be a surprise)  anyway, I'm rambling...we were forgotten often, and food was cold by the time we ate...Really wished it had been better"}
{"text":"After work yesterday, I stopped in for a small bite and a glass of wine.  My server was very sweet.  Amanda was her name. I ordered out of their small lunch menu.  Shrimp scampi with a ceasar salad. Of course I began with the salad which was perfect...until, I found an enormously long blonde hair wrapped around my lettuce... Now, I get it..I'm not trying to be a jerk..these things happen...for sure.  Hair doesn't freak me out..I'm a hairstylist...In my food?  Whole other sitch. I'm not gonna lie, that there was no way, I was about to finish that salad.  I placed the long long hair on my biscuit plate, and when my server came by, I explained she could take the salad away and showed her the hair...She was sweet and offered another salad...(i just wasn't into it) I declined, and she said \"thank you for telling me about this, we like to know when their is hair in the food.\"  hmmmm.... Two groups of people were seated after me and served waaay before me with much larger meals...maybe that's why. Scampi was acceptable, and rice was good..When I got the bill, I was surprised that nothing was reduced...I only had two bites of the salad.. I have honestly never had this happen, however, as a business owner, I would have offered a dessert, had the manager come over...something...but it was just shrugged off... Oh well, thought I would let y'all know my experience."}
{"text":"If you like zero customer service and an untrained staff then hurry on in. This is the place for you!"}
{"text":"Been coming here annually (around mid January) for my aunt's birthday for the past 10 years.  It's a nice tradition that we have.  No major complaints but our most recent visit didn't have the same feeling as prior visits.    For starters, half of my group had been seated before I got to the restaurant, so when I arrived I described the members of my group to the seating hostess.  She appeared to be typing some details into the computer but then replied by saying that she didn't know where they were and that I should go look around for them.  A man who appeared to be the manager must have overheard me because he located my table and waved me down.  I hope he also overheard the dismissiveness of his seating hostess.    During all of my other visits they always had a great special where you would get an appetizer, main, and dessert as a bundle (on any day).  This special was now only available on Monday-Thursday but we visited on a Sunday, like all of my past visits - big disappointment.  It also seemed like everything that used to be inclusive had an extra charge, like a cesar salad.  Dessert on the kids menu also has an extra charge.  I don't know about you, but anywhere I've ever eaten, the kids get a free dessert with their meal.    Overall I was let down by this experience, I feel that prices have gone up but the food has remained the same."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing staff. Linda and Paul are the best, very personable, speedy and truly care about creating a great guest experience at \"another chain\" restaurant. They don't have to put this much effort into their customer service but you can tell they truly care. The food was fresh, cane out quick and everything up to temp. The salad was cold (unlike other restaurants that are room temp), the coconut shrimp out the fryer and fresh. The  the salmon New Orleans was a huge portion! Linda and Paul are the best and if you visit this place you must request them!"}
{"text":"Love this Red Lobster. I have gone here maybe 10 times or so and have been delighted each time. It's great food and great service. I usually get the Lobster and never get the various fish. Ultimate feast is a winner."}
{"text":"Stopped by Red Lobster w/ my family once again.  A relative gave me a gift card for my birthday recently, so we indulged.    I'm going to keep this review short.  Our server was very good.  Our food tasted good, but I was hoping for a nice piece of fish.  I ordered the Tilapia.  I received a sliver of fish.  I would estimate it's weight to be about 3 ounces.  I was kind of laughing inside, a little.  Not really.  I don't know why everyone goes here.  I mean, it's packed on Friday and Saturday.  And for what?  Slivers of fish?  Really?  Three stars for the food taste and quality.  And an overriding two stars for the pathetic portion."}
{"text":"Last couple of times there their food just tastes nasty and the place looks dirty.....never going back"}
{"text":"I can't recall when I was last at a Red Lobster. I don't choose chain restaurants often. We came here on a mid-week night because an out-of-town guest insisted. Reading the previous reviews was pretty bleak so I didn't expect much. Yet to me it is unfair to go to a chain restaurant then rate it only 1-star because it wasn't a Michelin gourmet dining experience, geez what do some people expect?  More of a concern were the negatives about the terrible service. That's a deal-breaker for me no matter how fancy (or not) a restaurant is.  On this particular evening the place was decidedly uncrowded. Fine for us, bad for the restaurant. We were greeted by Jaron who has probably greeted a thousand customers and could be expected to be tired and bored on such a slow night. Yet he greeted and seated us like were honored guests, and it was evident that his cheerful smile and positive demeanor were not fake.  Our server, Mike, was prompt and attentive and generally not bad. His only issue is that throughout our meal he seemed rushed and not really into it. He didn't make any mistakes, brought us non-alcoholic drink refills before we asked and was familiar with most of the menu, a feat because their menus go on and on for many pages. At no time did we experience a longer than expected wait for any service.  Our guest had one of the ultimate platters which had a nice variety and was cooked properly. The other person had the featured salmon plate which had larger pieces that one would expect. And I had a surf 'n turf with red shrimp and sirloin steak (a dicey cut of meat under the best of circumstances). The steak was more tender than I expected and was passable. The shrimp tasted a lot like lobster and the pieces were huge. The wild rice was average and the Brussels sprouts were tough and chewy. But to be fair all of our meals were what we expected from a large chain restaurant.   Here are my two negatives ... one is that I realize most restaurants serve the salad course before the entrée, but I have never seen any restaurant bring a bowl of Cole slaw and set it down as the salad course before a fish entrée is served. That's just weird.  The other problem is that all of our meals were overpriced. I get that for some reason seafood restaurants think they can get away with being pricey but I won't lie to you, I've paid less at many non-chain fish restaurants where everything is fresh-caught and prepared by a gourmet chef. Their pricing is what would keep me from coming back. There is absolutely nothing at Red Lobster to warrant 3 people paying almost $100 with no cocktails or wine.  Going in I knew this is an average chain and my expectations were met. If priced 25-30% lower I could give them 4-stars but that's the thorn that drops them down a point. But I want to be clear that the quality of service was not an issue. It ranged from pretty good to very good."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this Red Lobster more stars...  Our server was great-- super friendly, attentive, & flexible with our dishes.  The food was to be expected from RL, mediocre seafood at a low-er price then what you pay for at the high end places. I got 1/2 dozen oysters & blackened swordfish fillet & my husband got the platter with scampi, lobster tail, & fried shrimp.  However, I can't overlook the fact that I got a violent case of food poisoning from coming here. Probably won't be back."}
{"text":"I've tried this place once, and the taste of the lobster reminded me very much of the smell you get when you change the dirty water in the aquarium for your pet fish.  Yum..."}
{"text":"I will give this place 2 stars & that's because I feel bad for the server. She did a pretty good job and was friendly. From there everything was horrible, the food was spilt by another server trying to help. And each dinner was brought every 3-5 min apart and our family didn't even get to eat together. One of the steaks were so bloody... Pretty much inedible. The manager walked by us several times and did not even offer an apology. Save your money!"}
{"text":"I will never go to Red lobster again. It took over 1 hour to get our food and when we told the manager he laughed at us and said it was because of a shift change. Wrote to customer service and got no response. This review is my revenge."}
{"text":"We came here for Endless Shrimp and the service was painfully slow compared to other locations. I'd take my business elsewhere."}
{"text":"Nigel was our server and he was great! I can't wait to come back. The food was delicious also. Didn't wait long for anything. He was very sweet. I'll ask for Nigel when I return!"}
{"text":"Apologies to Willie and Julio...  To all the Red Lobsters I lovvvvved before, Where I rejoiced coming thru the doooors.... Your food I oh so longed... I try and rhyme this sonnnng... To all the Red Lobsters I loooooved before...  For awesome cheddar garlic (bis)cuits... Clam chowder soups I loved to bits... The clams so fried so good... The fish on planks of woooood... To all the Red Lobsters I loooooved before...  It was just another visit... I came to savour more... But you then had ruined my order... And made good service seeeem.... to be a chore...  So I did come but once again... I marched on forth into the den... And ended up in hell... The food really did do smell... This was not the place I lovvvved before..."}
{"text":"We came here on a Monday afternoon to order off their lunch special. We got  1. Grilled chicken sandwich 2. Shrimp tacos 3. Strawberry lemonade for $23  - Lunch Specials: M-F 11-3pm. $7.99. Great deal! - Fresh bread - After 3pm, they have their 'Take 5' Deal. 5 for $5 from 3-6pm - If you come at 230, you can receive the best of both worlds! - Great chicken sandwich. Tasty - 4-5 pieces of either fried or grilled shrimp. Flavorful. Tortilla and rice were a bit hard.  - Flavorful drink. No refills. - Great service. Bryan was friendly and attentive.  - Better alternative for an American lunch compared to Red Robin during 11-3. Otherwise, I prefer RR simply bc bottomless fries and flavored drinks."}
{"text":"Hostess-Idiot. Server-Cunt!. Food-Disgusting. This locstion is way too ghetto. Avoid it!"}
{"text":"Ate here on Friday September 9th looking forward to the Endless shrimp.  We arrived early - about 4pm which was a nice quiet time and we were seated immediately.  I ordered a Sunset Colada and my wife got a Bahama Mama, both were excellent.  We ordered the Endless Shrimp meals, which we anticipate every September.  I enjoy the fact that they add different types of shrimp offerings, however I wish they wouldn't remove previous selections.  They're offering 5 selections this year:  Garlic Sriracha-Grilled Shrimp, Parmesan Peppercorn Shrimp, Shrimp Scampi, Hand-Breaded Shrimp, and Shrimp Linguini Alfredo.  You can order 2 selections for your first plate, and you get salad, choice of potato, and their cheddar bay biscuits.  We stuck with the linguini, scampi, and the Parmesan peppercorn shrimp.  Very good!  Our server was very attentive, we never had an empty plate, since she was always keeping up on our refill orders.  Everyone was very friendly and we had a great meal.  Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Been to this location so many times. Never been disappointed. I've had the rock lobster meal with steak, ultimate feast, live lobster. My only complaint is the the meal portion is was too small.  The price would be amazing if the portion could be a little bit more however the biscuits help full you up.  Service has always been great!"}
{"text":"Worst dinning experience ever. We had and extremely pushy waiter trying to upsell our bill very uncomfortable I've been coming red lobster fo 10 Plus years and always had a good experience the management needs to teach there waiters how to properly upscale without making the customer feel uncomfortable I had a Spanish male waiter I believe his name was angel he should be fired"}
{"text":"Called at 6:15 to see if there was a wait and was told no, arrived at 6:17 and was told to wait 15 minutes (mind you, I am with a 2 and 4 year old). Sat by 6:40, iced tea by 7pm, food by 7:30...fish and chips had bones in it...I won't be coming back here anytime soon."}
{"text":"Came in to order takeout, prolly should of used their app and just picked it up, but the experience of sitting at the bar having some water and biscuits while waiting for our food. The service from the bartender was awesome, she was busy but paid attention to all of her customers with exceptional service. This is my first experience on a carry out, I usually sit down and enjoy the meal here, but with increment weather approaching I thought it would be better to just get takeout for convenience. Quiet atmosphere, never was asked if we wanted to watch another channel or something, but overall it was a great experience overall!"}
{"text":"Nice bar service but just, OK nothing bad, just a Red Lobster."}
{"text":"Seafood McDonalds is that a thing? Apparently. I use to love coming to Red Lobster as a kid but things have changed. I came here with family recently and will not be returning to this red lobster or any ever again. I was just underwhelmed by the food as was my family. We had a gift card that paid for half the meal even then it still wasn't worth it.  This specific location was outdated and had a very small bathroom with only two stalls for a place that seems to see a high volume of people. I would not recommend coming here."}
{"text":"Came here on a Wednesday night and it was not too busy. We started off with the lobster pizza and the stuffed mushrooms. The service was very quick as our biscuits, appetizers, and salad all came out at the same time. Their cheddar biscuits are my favorite! I could eat a whole basket of them.   For dinner, my friend had the endless shrimp deal and started off with the Nashville fried shrimp and the Mediterranean shrimp. I had the Maine lobster with mashed potatoes and broccoli. The sides were pretty average, but I enjoyed the lobster. The endless shrimp deal was great, as he was able to try the shrimp scampi and shrimp linguini as well. Our waitress, Amanda, was excellent and made sure to constantly check if he wanted more shrimp. Overall, one of my go to chain restaurants."}
{"text":"Great foid and drinks. Waiter was attentive. Wilk recommend to family and friends. Will be returning for some great food!."}
{"text":"Love this place for all you can eat shrimp but came to get a table and they won't seat us because our whole party is not here. Now normally I understand that when a restaurant is busy they don't usually seat because of demand. But the restaurant is half empty! Customer service isn't what it used to be! I know you have corporate rules and all but you should be able to deal with all situations. Oh well guess I won't come back!"}
{"text":"I use to go here liked it but then they remolded and the new lighting hurts my eyes very badly. One time I walked out and my pupils were as small as pinheads for about a half hour. I don't have light sensitivity except for the average blue eyed person.   Food - good Wait staff - great."}
{"text":"Was invited to this place to celebrate my birthday, very nice place and friendly staff.  The reason why I gave three stars to this place is, first they don't give free birthday cake, my friends told the staff that it is my birthday if they can bring me a cake and they told then that they have to order, which is only a piece of cake especially that we did order a lot of food.  The second reason is they don't explain that if you select the trio option for apetizers you don't get the same size as when you order the apetizers individually. But the overall experience was good."}
{"text":"Not gonna waste my time. Didn't like it. Not for me. Food was average at best . Not a big seafood fan but went for birthday celebration. Won't be back. If I want seafood I'll wait for our annual family trip to Mexico"}
{"text":"I have been eating at Red Lobster for decades. I have witnessed the roller coaster through the decades. Red Lobster started failing big time a few years ago. I notified the corporate office when our baked potato was the size of a tater tot. I complained to corporate when my kid's meal wouldn't fill up a two year old, much less a six year old. They were surveying all diners when I was there a few months ago apparently in an effort to turn things around. They obviously LISTENED to their diners!!!  WOW!!! Red Lobster has turned things around!! They have increased the size of their shrimp by I believe 33%. The potato was so big yesterday that I brought half of it home. My kid's plate was FULL! It was a HUGE portion of large sized popcorn shrimp and so much broccoli that I brought some of that home too despite the fact that my kid loves broccoli. He simply couldn't eat it all!  We love the atmosphere and the service was great. We like the lunch Sailor's platter that includes fresh fish (we ask for it blackened but you can request fried or the standard broiled), fried shrimp, shrimp scampi and a side. Also included for the $11.00 price tag is a nice salad and all you can eat cheesy muffins.   We are pleased to see the positive changes, and we will be back soon!! Great job recently turning things around for the better Red Lobster!!"}
{"text":"We have been eating at Red Lobster for decades!!! It is a very affordable seafood restaurant that is consistently good!! My husband and I always order the Sailor's Platter. It is shrimp scampi, fried shrimp, steamed fish fillet (we request blackened or fried) and a baked potato. It comes with a salad or soup and unlimited cheesy biscuits for $11.49 at lunch. Don't forget to pour the extra butter from your shrimp scampi into your baked potato!! YUMMMM!!!  Our kid loves the kid's popcorn shrimp lunch and orders broccoli instead of fries. Their broccoli is fresh and cooked perfectly!! He gobbles it all up!! It is a good sized portion and it includes a drink for $5.99!!  We go to Red Lobster on a regular basis. I'm surprised I haven't written a review prior to now as they deserve five stars in my opinion!! We always leave happy and then discuss when we are returning as we leave!!"}
{"text":"Food was good.  Shrimp Salad with cup of clam chowder and great biscuits.  Service was not great.  Restaurant was almost empty but we couldn't get a glass of water.  $10 with tip not bad"}
{"text":"I'm rounding up on the star's, only because I'm feeling generous. Am a regular at this restaurant. It's close & reasonably priced given what's offered and I don't want to deal with strip restaurants. I've become a fan of their seasonal specials. I've found them well thought out and tasty. You need to me mindful, very few items are actually cooked/prepared from scratch. It's basically fried, broiled, grilled or microwaved from a bag. Most items are all ready pre-seasoned. This is a chain, the food servers hired are trained to give the same mantra and very often provide service based on your response to the manta. The secret to a \"positive\" experience is develop a relationship with one or two servers, Ask for them each time you visit, tip them accordingly. Otherwise you will end up with a food server who will treat you based on what he/she thinks they are going receive. With chain restaurants like these food servers are rated (shift wise) on many tables they can turn in a given time. The service is timed from the minute your order is turned, salad arrives,entree, etc. You have very little control, unless you speak up. Also keep in mind if the order presented is not to your liking or is lacking, don't' send it back only to be re-heated, order something new. It may take a bit of time, it will surely enhance your experience."}
{"text":"To bd I can't give NO STARS.....Do not use wait list. IT IS A JOKE. Do not go to this place on the WEEKEND. Got on WAITING LIST@ 1:30 pm for seating at 6:30. Got to restaurant STILL HAD TO STAND AND WAIT 30 min. When you take the time to Register for a seating. With a 83 year old person with mobility problems. Waiting is Difficult. WILL NEVER RETURN.Why ask if there is no way you can achieve the task. . RED LOBSTER : GOOD FOOD: OVER PRICED : POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE.The Person I think is the person who seats you had the guts to tell me that there were people in front of me . DO YOU THINK THEY  Got ON TGE WAIT LIST BEFORE 1:30 like i did. No I don't STUPID. To top off a evening of POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE. I had made a PARTY  PLATTER order @ 5:00pm so I could take it with me after our dinner. Asked our server to get it for us. Wanted it for the Super Bowl Sunday.The MANAGER TOLD ME THEY HADNOT  COOK IT YET. Again RED LOBSTER HAS NOT FIGURED OUT HOW TO USE A COMPUTER. Why make on line so hard. Wait list, order platters.. DON'T. Poor Manager. Lack of customer skills.Nothing but EXCUSES. And not very good at them. If you like to get sea food and Excuses  and what you hoped for and planned for not going to happen atRed Lobster . Go during the week . Not busy and the customer gets respect."}
{"text":"Yucky salad.. no bread untill my meal.. told server about BAD salad.. she said she would let the manager know... And then ten minutes later she brought me my full bill... Well no discount for a bad salad ...here."}
{"text":"To high-priced for all that it is the only thing they have going for them is it's the only seafood restaurant in town if you don't at least get a salad and another good side dish like a baked potato  you will go away hungry"}
{"text":"Do I need to say something for this place? It is AWESOME. It always makes me SOooo satisfied every time I go. You won't go wrong with anything - I particularly liked the split lobster - I thought the wood grilled lobster is a little bland compare to the other style. The garlic shrimp is also a must try. Crabs are less mind blowing but still really good.  The nicest thing about this place is their biscuits - I would always finish one batch and ask for another batch and pack them home and munch on them for the next day. It is super soft. I also love their lava cake - awesome dessert choice, but you gotta have some space in your stomach to finish that big baby. I usually split it between at least 3 people..   Keep in mind that their drink menu is also very exciting. They also come with giant portions. Don't eat too much of the salad before the entree if you have a marble stomach, otherwise, just sit tight and enjoy the ride!"}
{"text":"THIS PLACE IS AWESOME!  Before I went there, I heard people saying that service at red lobster is generally bad so I was a little scared when I decided to take my boyfriend there for his birthday. Well, I decided to go for the first time because I had a gift card from my cousin from 4 years ago and I really wanted to use it.  and the experience there was just awesome. The waitresses were very nice and friendly. They helped me with my birthday surprise plan and brought up the dessert that I secretly ordered with a lit candle. Other staffs also joined us to sing the birthday song. awww.  The lobsters were very delicious. I particularly like the wood grilled lobster. I also like the garlic shrimp a lot. OH BTW, RED LOBSTER BISCUITS ARE THE BEST OF THE BEST! we finished them so fast that we just kept asking them to give us more! Then why yes we went back there again a few weeks ago for more lobster - that time was without any gift card so that was a genuine choice!"}
{"text":"this is a good place to enjoy a drink and some shrimp if you are waiting for the bus or not waiting for the bus. you can eat biscuits and read yesterday's toronto sun newspaper."}
{"text":"So the food was good. The biscuits were warm and seasoned just enough. The soups (lobster bisque, clam chowder and potato bacon) were all good. The food arrived: so each order (3 total) was a bit altered... (1) my shrimp scampi came late... forgotten. (2) medium rare steak came well done. (3) well done steak came raw and baked potato arrived after most of the food was consumed... the excuse \"it's just not ready yet\" (?) who does that.   The service was pleasant, just everything was a bit discombobulated..."}
{"text":"This place isn't bad, I've always enjoyed myself.  But ordering the crablegs is a complete rip off for what you get.  For larger people, you would not be full off 3 orders of the crab legs let alone 1.    The interior is dark, but some people like it like that.  Service is hit or miss.  I liked the treasure chest prizes at the end of the night when I was a kid, it brings back great memories of bubble hockey stickers.  Derek"}
{"text":"For some reason my dad has been pushing for Red Lobster for the past 6 months. \"David, you just came home after two years, let's go to Red Lobster\". \"David, it's your birthday, let's go celebrate at Red Lobster\". \"You know Red Lobster has a four course meal for $15\". Finally the day has come where dad gets to be the king. Father's Day was the chance to take him to the place where he has been wanting to go to and get it out of his system. Sadly, on the way home, the conversation was centered around how cheap they were with the quality of seafood and how this place used to be the it place to go.  The four course meal is a deal at $15. You get a choice of bacon potato soup or New England clam chowder to begin. It is followed by a garden or Caesar salad. The starters are accompanied by their cheddar cheese biscuits. At this point I was full and there were still two courses to go. My parents and I ordered the butter herb chicken and shrimp while my sister got the mango habenero coconut shrimp. I found my dish to be extremely salty. I had a few bites, but the rest was taken home to be eaten with white rice or something bland. The two chicken breast and eight small shrimp was more than I was expecting at this price. My sister's shrimp platter came with two skewers of grilled shrimp as well as a nest of golden fried morsels. This was the better of the two dishes as I was not gulping down cups of water after each bite. With most of it packed away, I was not feeling dessert, but it came with the meal. Three slices of key lime pie and an order of the cinnamon donuts came out. The key lime was not as tart as I am used to, but the balance of sweet to sour was good. The donuts were a little on the dry side, but was not sickeningly sweet.  After this experience, maybe my dad will stop insisting on Red Lobster and we can go back to Chinatown for less. Anyways, it was a nice Father's Day."}
{"text":"What do you say when a restaurant is empty and we're being told that there is a 15 minute wait. When ask why I was told they were under staffed and the manger said they didn't want to over work the staff. There goes $200 spot that could have belong to you. Now it's at Hooters."}
{"text":"The hostess was nice and seated us in ten - fourteen minutes of us arriving.  Once we met our waitress she was gone as fast as we were introduced.  The food was great, this place couldn't disappoint except the waitress.  She was never attending her tables, everyone was looking for her and we were out of everything throughout most of our meal (to incl. our drinks, napkins, biscuits, utensils and ketchup).  So this is why they got two stars, for the service but the food was great."}
{"text":"The Ultimate feast is what I feasted on!  Crab legs, one lobster tail, a plate of sautéed shrimp and a garlic shrimp screwer.  For $29  It was a bit expensive for my plate, but the seafood was fresh! The crab was not dried out, it was moist and juicy.  The peach tea was refreshing and delicious.  Peter was our server, he was very friendly and attentive!  I was so hungry, I forgot to take a photo of my food!"}
{"text":"So I had the roasted lobster with corn in yellow potatoes,  it was marginal at best The lobsters were like rock lobster and they say they give you four lobster tails cut in half however I really only got five haves (21/2 tails) so it's not what they say they're going to give you.  I will tell you the staff are very good, the food came out on time, and the overall experience was pretty good.  For a national chain restaurant red lobster is really consistent the only thing I didn't like was the portion size for the amount of money you pay for the dish. Take away the price, the food seemed fresh and tasted ok, however it just doesn't look like the pictures on the menu. I would  recommend red lobster to anyone who enjoys eating per made seafood and doesn't mind dealing with a national chain.  Here in Las Vegas there is just way too many great restaurants to goof around going to a chain restaurant like red lobster."}
{"text":"The endless shrimp advertisement brought us to here. It looked great and made us to have some seafood!  Calamari appetizer.. was little disappointed, not crispy fried. Endless shrimp was nothing special, we didn't feel having more orders for endless.. The saddest part was the lobster was too hard and dry..  rib-eye steak was OK but not great as we expected.  Oh on where is our tasty seafood???  ..I guess I had high expectation cuz we haven't here long time.  Now I feel we won't go back for a while again."}
{"text":"When you go to a Red Lobster, you know what you are going to get.  But there has been some changes that need addressing.  Salads are  premade and holding in the cooler.  This means sometimes the veggies are not as crisp as they could be and the bowl is very cold.  The onions are cut into big hunks so you need your knife for the salad.   I have gotten unclean silverware on more than one occasion.  The server is alway quick to find another roll.  I just wish someone would check the utensils prior to being wrapped in the napkin.  The Ice tea is a strong brew so I need to remember to order a water on the side or go with a soft drink.  Lunch is a more affordable option.  But coupons are frequently in the paper.  I ordered the make your own lunch.  Everything was cooked well.  My parents share a platter as it is a lot of different seafood items.  Red Lobster is not fine dining.  But for a chain restaurant,  it is a nice place for seafood if you don't want to cook it yourself.  It is a nice place to take the parents."}
{"text":"We came here today for a Fathers Day lunch, i wasnt surprised that the place was packed.  But the wait wasnt that long, what did take long was our order.  The service was good, our server was very friendly and thoughtful.  Portion size for each entree was pretty big, enough to fill you up.  They always give you complementry butter biscuits which are so yummy, you can actually get full just eating them.  Overall the food was decent, nothing much to rave about.  Eventhough red lobster has been in the business for a long time, the quality of their food is still good.  Which on its own is already an accomplishment.  Red Lobster is still a good go to place for seafood."}
{"text":"I don't know why this location got very low rate of reviews. Surely it's one of my favorite locations. The food is good and the service is super even when they are sooo busy."}
{"text":"I came here with my husband and his family and decided to have lunch after a wedding ceremony. We all were excited to come here as there is no Red Lobster in Vancouver. Our table got lobster scones which was a nice incentive. However, it was covered in butter and quite salty. I ordered the lobster Bisque and Caesar salad with breaded shrimp. Unfortunately, the soup was extremely salty and I could only finish a quarter of it. The salad was covered heavily in ranch dressing and I couldn't finish that either. My brother in law ordered the lobster and waffles which I tried a bit of, and that was delicious. My husband ordered a medley of seafood- he couldn't finish his meal either due to the feeling of heaviness from the deep fry and heavy breading. The shrimp, scallops and clams were apparently dry. I think we all agreed we would not come again for the food. The service we received was excellent though and our server was very friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Yeah I got suckered by the family into going for shrimpfest. It really disturbs me to wait such a long time for such mediocre food. The shrimp dishes were good, but I just don't see the reason to wait 45 minutes for them.   The service is slow at best, albeit friendly. The shrimp dishes that were re-ordered took upwards of 15-20 minutes to be brought out. The shrimp scampi and the teriyaki shrimp were my first choice and they were actually quite good. The teriyaki shrimp had a sweet flavor from the glaze yet remained crisp and savory. The shrimp scampi was simple with butter and garlic. The surprise dish was the new parmesan shrimp that was like shrimp sampi plus breadcrumbs and parmesan cheese. It was delicious but took forever to be prepared. We even got 2 orders delivered to the table after we had already paid our check.    Bottom line: If you're strong-armed by your family into coming it isn't horrible, but if you have other options consider them!"}
{"text":"The last time I had been to Red Lobster was at the NW Motel Village location just before they closed it up. I had been waiting for years to get back motivated by previous good experiences. Today we visited the 36th St NE location after specifically planning to be in that area in the late afternoon. For a start the location is terrible what with the LRT etc close by.   Ordered lobster tail with sides of broccoli and stuffed potato, mentioned to waiter I like lots of garlic as that's how I remembered it and why I had come across the city to try it again. What a disappointment, lobster was blah, the broccoli was bland, it was steamed or cooked in water with no seasoning or sauce and tasteless and rubbery. I used the garlic butter sauce that's supposed to be for the lobster on the broccoli but it didn't help at all, then had none for the lobster. My girlfriends assorted seafood platter was equally disappointing, basically tasteless and dry. One drink each, bill $76. This was a perfect place where I shouldn't have left a tip, but who likes to do that nowadays. A big disappointment, will never go back."}
{"text":"It was not bad... It was ok to be a  franchise.... The biscuits were good and I liked the stuffed mushroom ... In general the food was heavier than I prefer... But not terrible, it just could be better... The drinks were really good, the cocktails were delicious, and the service was friendly..."}
{"text":"From worst to best:  The food, (solid 2 stars, if even - pretty disappointing for the Red Lobster chain) Food presentation, (1 star) The service, (3.5 stars) The biscuits (I don't think it's possible for them to mess these up, which I am thankful for).  I was instantly disappointed from the first bite I took of the Chef's Signature Shrimp and Lobster Pasta.    I wouldn't go here again and pay Red Lobster prices for sub-Red Lobster quality food."}
{"text":"The 6 of us (family) went to Red Lobster on Marks in Henderson. There was plenty of parking right up front. We were seated promptly as I made reservations a couple days before, and our waitress gave us great service. I was craving lobster and everyone at our table got a lobster tail among other things (salad, soup, steak, etc). I was very disappointed as the lobster appeared slightly tough and their cheese biscuits were stale and tasteless. No one complained but I didn't feel good about everyone paying such a high price ($62 each including tip) for a non fine dining experience.  Next year on my birthday we'll find a better place to go."}
{"text":"I'm really not a big chain restaurant guy.  In fact, I'll typically go out of my way to avoid them.  Red lobster surprised me tonight as I wasn't going into this with high expectations.  I think if the service wasn't as wonderful as it was, I wouldn't have enjoyed the experience as much as I did.  However, Georgia out waitress was just wonderful.  She continued to go out of the way to keep my son happy.  She even brought a lobster out of the tank for him to pet.  He was so excited to watch it do \"tricks\" like hold crayons.     The food actually wasn't bad either.  I went with the lobsterfest dueling lobster tails.  One had a seafood stuffing and was just okay.  The other was topped with grilled shrimp and a tasty sauce that I enjoyed.  The drinks were good as well, the featured lobster punch goes down almost too easy and the after dinner adult coffee was the right balance of smooth sweet alcohol and bitter coffee.    All in all id actually be back, and coming from me for a chain restaurant that's about the biggest compliment I could give."}
{"text":"I don't know why, perhaps it was the lure of fuel perks for getting the gift card to eat here, but we decided to give this place another shot. It was Saturday evening and it was busy, but not overly crowded. We used call ahead seating, but really didn't need to. There were plenty seats available. The place was messy inside, but they were working on cleaning soon after we were seated. It was about 7:30 in the evening but there were still a lot of families with kids so kind of noisy.  We ordered the artichoke, crab, lobster dip for an appetizer and it was flavorful. I ordered coconut shrimp for dinner and my fiancée got the broiled trio with tilapia, crab stuffed shrimp and garlic shrimp. We both ordered the lobster mashed potatoes. Everything was delicious.  No room for dessert. As a nice touch, our server Jenna gave us a couple iced teas for the road. She is a terrific server, very nice, friendly and provided good service."}
{"text":"The service here was exceptional! Ryan, my server, was funny, attentive, almost as if he could read my mind and cute! The other server in the section helped out too and both were really good at their job.  The endless shrimp is awesome, and the newer shrimp options are some of my new favorites!"}
{"text":"Lobster feast, who doesn't love lobster! Got our coupon two for one from the paper and here we are.  Had lobster tail, snow crab legs, garlic shrimp, fried shrimp a nice salad and their cheese rolls!  Very busy, a little wait, new decor and added space helped! Good service."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar and the bartender was very friendly. Was a good day so I ordered the Steamed King Crab Legs with a red wine. The biscuits were good as always and I enjoyed the wine. When I got my meal, I noticed the crabs were a bit over steamed. When I tried to crack the shell, it would bend like rubber. The meat was a bit salty for my liking.   I like Red Lobster, but I wouldn't be ordering the crab legs again. If they over steam, probably won't order the whole lobster neither. Would probably come back for fish and chips or shrimp pasta."}
{"text":"It is pretty pricey here. Service was mediocre. The food is average. One positive thing is that the meal is pretty big that it lasted a couple meals. By the way, if you're a Red Lobster bread roll fan, you can go to any local grocery store and buy the frozen Red Lobster roll and back them yourself for much cheaper and they are good too!"}
{"text":"Lobster Pot Pie Was Good But Cheddar Bay Biscuits Always Rule..."}
{"text":"Let's begin to say this was not my choice (and it never will be). It was a combined annual birthday dinner for my BF and his friend. I've been here before with the same group (8-10 of us). They obviously like it, unfortunately for me.  If you're into proper seafood, this place is a big thumbs down. 'Dead Lobster' (as it is apparently affectionately known as) is only for those that like deep-fried, pre-made crap from the freezer. That, I can do at home with the help of say M&M's.   I thouight I'd be 'safe' this time and order steak and sides of 'Maine lobster tail' and 'grilled scallops'. I made it very clear to the server not to over cook the steak: under med-rare, closer to rare, chared on the outside. It was NY strip, rather than sirlon. It was over done - just pink in the middle rather than red, no char it was like medium in my book.   The lobster was meagre in size and delightfully came with intestinal track... yum.. not!  The scallops had no grill marks whatsoever and were rubbery & tasteless.  The famous biscuits I remember from years ago have changed. I recall them with nuggets of cheese and chive. The one thing that used to salvage a meal there are now just a dissapointment.  Everyone else at the table appeared to enjoy their food. I am not ususally shy about sending food back, but, personally, I think it's in poor taste if you are someone's guest.  The only reason they don't get one star is because  the server was friendly and attentive.  I am at a loss why this chain is always busy and the prices do not match food quality and/or preparation.  For the same money, I could enjoy the Keg.  If you are a real seafood lover - AVOID."}
{"text":"Went here last night for dinner at around 5:30. Place is nice and pretty updated, it is cold inside so I recommend bringing a light sweater of some sort. I got a Chicken meal with mashed potatoes and it was pretty good. The chicken could have been cooked a little bit more though. Service is nice and the waitress we had was super nice."}
{"text":"I love red lobster. The free biscuits are probably one of the main reasons I would go (They are so tasty, and you can always ask for more!). It's nice that the main entrees include your choice of salad. To my opinion of the Caesar salad, quite tasty and sort of satisfying as a snack. Eat it slowly so you don't get too full before the main dish.   The portion of the main entree, specifically the shrimp linguine was pretty big. I usually finish my food at restaurants but this time I had to pack some to go with a decent amount to have for lunch the next day. Other than that, the pasta was great and would most likely get it again.   Overall service was speedy, our waiter was nice and offered advice on what drinks to have. A bit pricey but worth it if you're willing to go out and have a nice dinner."}
{"text":"Came here with my daughter on a Saturday night and ended up waiting for a short while for seating.   The staff was friendly and my waitress was very attentive and quick with the drinks and food.   I had salmon New Orleans and my daughter had Mac n cheese and orange slices. My salmon was delicious too."}
{"text":"Server was a jerk...food was horrible! Chowder was super gritty in every bite! We won't be back. Don't know what I always fall for it and go here.....last time - done!"}
{"text":"Our service was very good, but the food was the opposite. Stay away from the crab linguini, it's just an oily mess... also my boyfriend ordered a medium rare steak & it was well done. We won't be returning."}
{"text":"This was one of the saddest visits to a seafood restaurant in a very long time. My wife and I were hoping to pop in, grab two quick salads, and pop out at 11AM on a Sunday morning.   Our experience did not even come close to expectations. The salads took over 40-45 minutes to come out from the kitchen, despite the restaurant being 10% occupied. Our waitress, Bianca A, was horrible. She had a terrible attitude and did everything she could to avoid eye contact with us.   See the picture of the receipt that I upload. For $10 per salad, I expect the salad to at least be hearty enough to fill me up. Should have gone to Olive Garden.  Overall, I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone. Although it is proximal to Concord Mills (which was our destination), there are a lot of better choices.  Avoid this Red Lobster."}
{"text":"I made reservations through Open Table for Fathers Day per my dads request. We arrived on time, the host checked us in and we were quickly seated at our table.  The table was a quaint two person table situated near the back, it was perfect for the two of us.  Our server greeted us and asked us for our drink order. My dad asked for a Bloody Mary, which he is typically very picky about but he really seemed to enjoy it. We were off to a great start.  The fresh baked cheddar biscuit were brought to the table and they were even better than I had remembered.   For lunch, I ordered a Shrimp Caesar Salad and a bowl of Lobster Bisque and my dad ordered the Shrimp Tacos.   When our food arrived, I was brought chowder by mistake but when I mentioned I had ordered the Lobster Bisque, the bowl was quickly taken away, the manager came and apologized and my Bisque was brought out quickly. I appreciated the quick response for sure.  The food was delicious. We didn't have one bad thing to say. My dad said his tacos were really good as well as the side of rice that came with them. I had no complaints about either of my items, the Bisque is sooo good, the only thing that could have made it better was more Lobster. :)  Once we finished out meal and paid we sat on the porch out front for fifteen minutes or so just hanging out. One of the hosts came outside and wished my dad a Happy Fathers Day, it was very sweet and genuine.  I appreciated the excellent service that we received from the staff as well as the quality of the food.   I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The occasion was my brother's birthday dinner and this was his choice. If I could have reached through the phone and given him a back handed slap across the face, I would've since his choices were unlimited. Everyone else's food was ok, but I wasn't happy because of the poor execution of my simple dish.  Utilizing call ahead seating, our party of 8 was seated immediately. I have no complaints about our server, Dom, who flew solo handling our party without any issue. The appetizers, salads, and entrees were brought out in a smooth, timely manner without significant waits.  I thought I'd stick with something that was pretty safe and ordered the grilled rainbow trout ($20.49). Somehow they managed to mess this one up. The fish was served skin side down, and after I sliced a piece from the filet, the fish was not warm and sitting in a pool of liquid. It seemed that my fish filet was frozen and wasn't thawed properly resulting in the liquid to leach out after resting drenching the skin leaving it soggy. Rainbow trout can definitely use some assistance with seasoning. I had to provide the assistance by squeezing lemon and cracking salt and pepper over the filet which one should never have to do. I made the mistake of trusting the cooks and not ordering a sauce or ordering it blackened. And the pre-portioned and reheated sides offered no assistance to the dish either.  My wife did enjoy her shrimp tacos. The cheddar biscuits were refilled multiple times, but other than that, nothing significantly positive was mentioned about the rest of the basically fried or pre-prepped and heated entrees. I had low expectations going in, and they did not meet them. You'll be better off getting your seafood dishes at one of the many oyster bars or crab places because the food is more flavorful and executed much better."}
{"text":"We had been purposely avoiding Red Lobster after a really bad experience at another location, but we had a $75 gift card and since this restaurant chain has no longer been run by Darden for a couple years now, we had no other options but to visit this spot on Marks. Overall, everything was A-OK, our server was good when he was present, the food wasn't amazing, but it wasn't inedible either.  We were seated immediately on Tuesday night in a booth in the bar area. The look of this restaurant is the same as all the others with a New England maritime theme. The menu has a standard format with fresh catches prepared to your liking, traditional entrees, and the well-advertised seasonal promotions which they do a great job of selling and often have me craving some seafood. As far as drinks, everything is pretty middle of the road liquor, beer, and wine, as expected, with not too many bottles from the top shelf.  After a cheddar biscuit or two, you actually get a fair amount of food for just under $30 with the Ultimate Feast. The lobster tail is the main attraction of the dish. The shrimp scampi is good if you're in a buttery-garlic mode, and I think it's safe to say most everyone is. The crab legs and fried shrimp were not overcooked, but both were on the salty side having me grab for my Fat Tire. My wife really liked the shrimp tacos and my daughter finished her chicken caesar salad. The warm apple crostada was reheated sufficiently and wasn't a bad sweet finish.  The server was absent for an extended period of time on multiple occasions, but otherwise, there were no issues. The bill for three was $5 before tip and after the $75 gift card was redeemed. The fresh catch selections are you usually your safest bets for fish. Otherwise, expect recipes with some variation of shrimp, snow crab legs, or lobster tail with an occasional fish filet thrown in there and maybe in a combination. Save for the few grilled items, the flavors are fitting for those that prefer their food on the fried, salty side of the spectrum."}
{"text":"Tried to have lunch here AT NOON - they were practically empty but told us it would be a 15 minute wait because they just got a party of 22 and didn't have enough servers. First of all, it's LUNCH TIME why don't you have enough servers for 22 guests? They gave us the option of sitting at the bar for faster service. We were THE ONLY people at the bar. There were THREE servers standing around at the bar watching ONE person make A SINGLE DRINK for over 8 minutes. NONE OF THE THREE even so much as said \"hello\" - no one said they'd be with us in a minute. Nothing. We were literally ignored the entire time. Needless to say we left and will not be back. We understand busy. We understand lunch time. This place was like a ghost town and no one could even acknowledge us."}
{"text":"The food taste is fine but the service is horrible. The waiters tools forever between order and order. I get the endless shrimp and took fifteen minutes to refill my plate. I order a beer. Took almost ten minutes to bring it. Never more!"}
{"text":"Nice location, wasn't busy when me and my daughters got there.... We love the cheddar biscuits and I love the Bahama mama drink! The hubby isn't a fan so he didn't eat but, he's driving so I get to drink lol. Waitress was pleasant always checking on us, the kids enjoyed looking at the fresh lobster. Didn't wait too long for the food, and when we left we were very satisfied! Will come back to this location!   Parking was easy too, and it's right Across the street from the mall for walking off your meal!:-)"}
{"text":"I'll start with the good. The food tasted delicious and was still warm when I got home. I ordered take out. The price was perfect for a 3 course meal. The bad is the to go ordering. I sat down and informed the woman I needed to place a to go order. She said okay; brought a menu and said I'll be right back. Roughly 15 mins later she came back and took my order. I then waited another 25 mins for my meal. By the time I got to my car I was thinking it might have been quicker to just eat there. Other than the length it took to place and receive my order, everything was fine."}
{"text":"Terribly ran! We will never be back to this location. Food takes forever and it doesn't come out right. The wait staff is slow and management has no clue."}
{"text":"Excellent,  excellent service. Alex our waiter, did an exceptional job. We are here on vacation and we wanted to have a dinner. I must say I am surprised. Good job Alex, food was good, service was good, evening was perfect. Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"If you want to get food poisoning then this is your restaurant! I went to the Brampton location in Queen Street in the summer with my brother.  I ordered the pick three and had the shrimp linguini, chicken and garlic shrimp. When I was served I stared to eat and then found a long human hair in my linguini. I called the waitress and she was not very receptive - really couldn't have cared and offered me a new meal. I said no but I'm not paying for this. They took the meal off my bill but still had the nerve to charge me for my coke and salad. I then went home and later felt ill. Before I knew it I was throwing up and having bad diarrhea. My brother also was quite sick. The food is not fresh and I can imagine the kitchen is disgusting based on my meal which was close to $30.00 for garbage. Don't go here unless you wanna take your chances. If I could give zero stars I would to this Red Lobster."}
{"text":"We have been this Red Lobster many times over the years with reasonable results.  But our last 3 visits have not been very good.  The wait on non weekend days is excessive.  The tables are not full but we still wait which suggests that there are not enough waiters or the cooks can't keep up.  Once seated the wait continues with extended wait for the appetizer. We finally got the appetizer with the meal - sort of defeats the purpose. Same for the signature biscuits they came way late with the meals. The menu has changed for the worse and the portion sizes have been down sized and up priced. The food is good but not exceptional for an establishment that focuses on sea food. We will give Red Lobster one more chance but will not go to this Red Lobster again we try another location."}
{"text":"Wait for 40 mins maybe because of the special deal $17.99 all i can eat shrimp. The waiter keep rushing us with attitude.. really... finally getting the drink and he drop the cup with attitude again. Food is sucks... bad service.. first time and my last time here. Red lobster Suck...the person who giving service to me not only harming this location, but all the red lobster location."}
{"text":"Finally decided to give this place another try! I literally just came back from this restaurant.. it was good today, compared to last time. I had the sunset Pina colada and lobster tacos. The lobster tacos was Okay, I would not order it again. My sister ordered the Caribbean pineapple salmon with mash and shrimp and her food tasted AMAZING. That's the only reason I'm giving it 4 stars or else it would of been 3. I told myself I have to come here either next week or the other and get the same thing she ordered! Yes, that's how good it was. I love the biscuits.. Nothing new, always did. I'll be back for that, she said it's only for a limited time so I definitely will be here sometime next week or the other for that tasty salmon!"}
{"text":"I've read a lot of reviews on here about how the place is dirty and the service is terrible, but that doesn't seem to be the case the handful of times that I've come in.  If anything, the service has always been nice, the food and drinks have been excellent, and there's plenty of food to take home.  To me, a good server is courteous, helpful, stays on top of things, and has a good personality.  I normally have gotten a \"seafood expert\" with a good sense of humor, and is good at answering questions about what dishes consist of.  My last meal, I tried their $15 deal, and for what you get, it's worth the price, and easily the best deal.  A soup, a salad, the main entree with a side, and dessert.  The portions are respectable, and as anyone else notes, the cheddar biscuits are seriously good.  I also tried some beverage that has raspberry, blueberry and blackberry in it, and it well made for that \"comfortable zone\" during my meal.  Their booze has always been consistently tasty.  It's kind of crazy to think that they have as robust a bar as they do.  The last time I went in there it was fairly quiet, and we were seated almost instantly.  By the time we left, however, people were lined up outside and leaving because the place was full.  The parking lot always seems full, so I think it's a matter of picking the best time to go over there.  All in all not bad.  For seafood chain fare, they are quite decent, and I hope that $15 menu remains a mainstay (but I hope they diversify some options over time).  Not bad.  I came out full and content.  Always a plus for me.  And I brought the extra cheddar biscuits home, so I lived the dream for another day or so."}
{"text":"Our server was excellent and the food was great, the long island ice tea was perfect. can not wait to go back again.   Tip: make sure you go during the hours of 3-4 on the weekend it was dead, so it was excellent"}
{"text":"The food was delicious! But the prices was fairly high for a not-too-big-plate of sea food. A lot of butter was used to make the food tastier and probably to fill our stomach faster."}
{"text":"The three star consensus seems about right, but there are some positives to note.  The petting zoo! At least that's what we'll call it. Don't be shy. Ask the receptionist if your little ones can touch one of the lobsters in the tank in the waiting area. On our way in, a bold young woman pulled out the largest lobster in the tank and held it for us. On our way out, a less bold young woman placed the smallest lobster in the tank on a tray. Fun either way. We decided to leave a discussion of the fate of these lobsters for another day.  The kids menu. Most items are about six bucks, including a drink and your choice of broccoli or orange slices. Drop ten bucks on snow crab for your little tyke if you must.  Birthday songs. Servers will sing for your birthday. Not the most inspired happy birthday renditions ever heard, but there were three birthdays being celebrated this night, so it must be enough to keep people coming back. Note, however, there are no free birthday treats. You must buy a dessert to hold the candle. We opted to share a Chocolate Lava Cookie (about seven bucks), but you can go with a $1.99 kids sundae if the celebration is for a young one.  The bread. The warm cheesy bread is awesome. And replenished without apparent limit.  The rest of the food? Everything we ordered was fine, from $20 samplers to the $6 kids meals. The adult entrees were not all that expensive, but seemed kind of pricey for what they were. Mostly a lot of bland fried food. Perhaps just mistakes ordering. Service was friendly, but very slow this night. Felt we could have gone to Pete's Fish & Chips and seen a movie with the time and the money saved. The atmosphere, however, would not have been nearly as nice as Red Lobster for the six year old birthday girl who was craving shrimp (and who loves the petting zoo)."}
{"text":"Yesterday my husband and I walked into Red Lobster on Eastern to be greeted by a surly female at the front desk. We asked for a table by the window (3 were available) and she growled that it would be a while. She picked up the phone, engaged in a long conversation, and proceeded to ignore us until we walked out. She must be a racist, as there was no other reason to be so rude to us. She needs to be fired!"}
{"text":"Husband had the fish and chips. His fish had a big piece of bone/cartridge and the batter was so thick he was scraped half of it off.  I ordered the crab linguine alfredo, got the chicken instead.  I should have kept it, when I finally got the crab, the meat was cold and their Alfredo sauce was way to salty.  Best part of my meal was the mojito."}
{"text":"I have always enjoyed coming here. We came here this Saturday and I really loved it! The service is better than any eatery I have ever been to. Each time I come here, the waiters are so friendly and caring. Our waitress kept checking on us every 10 minutes to make sure we were satisfied. She brought our drinks in under a minute and our food came in 20. Which was very little time considering it was a Saturday evening and was crowded. The food was delicious. The lobster mashed potatoes are so great! Would eat here any day."}
{"text":"According to Yelp, I'm a regular here.. So this review is going to be based off tonight's experience compared to my last visits. 1. the biscuits tonight where WAY smaller than last. Normally they'd be the width of a glass cup, tonight they were half that. 2. I ordered the \"Crab Lovers Dream\". The crab linguine Alfredo was over salted. The snow crab was over cooked and the meat stuck to the shells but overall had a good flavor. The king crab was absolutely horrible. It had no flavor whatsoever; no salt, pepper or buttery flavor - just boiled pot water. After cracking the crab and taking two bites from the pasta, I ended up mixing the crab meat with the pasta and giving up on my meal.  3. The lighting in there is way too dim. I couldn't tell the crab meat from the crab shell.   Don't know that I'll return to red lobster from a craving.. I'll probably end up at the boiling crab instead."}
{"text":"Stepping off the greyhound bus, my eyes scanned the street for my favourite sushi spot. I uttered a cry when I realized it had been replaced by Beijing dumpling something or other. But I absolutely had to eat right away. Red lobster caught my eyes.  The meal started strong. The infamous biscuits curbed my appetite. The mojito was surprisingly sweet and refreshing.  The coconut shrimp was a total miss (too dry, dipping sauce too sweet). I ordered the blue sirloin steak and was given the wrong order, but they quickly remedied the situation and threw in a skewer of garlic shrimp. Unfortunately they also threw in broccoli instead of my side salad.   My friend had the crab linguini and it was pretty fab and a huge portion. Calorie galore but really tasty. And great for a doggie bag.   I RECOMMEND- the mojito. It's really hard to find a good one in this city.   EXTRA TIP- as far as chains go, this one is a bit steep. $60 for two main courses, one shared appy and one cocktail? Blimey."}
{"text":"This place is terrible. Im here with 6 other ppl. We arrived at 352pm and its currently 708 and i havent gotten my food still. Its my little sisters birthday today and 4 hours have gone to waist. They are not busy and the staff sucks. Our server John was awesome but theres only so much he can do. I do not reccommend coming here with any more than 4 ppl and even still... this place sucks!!! The worst red lobster in ohio by far !!!"}
{"text":"I normally HATE chain places and is never eat at Red Lobster but a friend went and got married at the court house and had his wedding dinner there so I had no choice.  I studied the menu and just hit the coconut shrimp with the seafood Alfredo!  It was so good I've been back three times this month.  Very fresh.  Free cheddar biscuits and a great salad with chunky blue cheese not all just ice burg lettuce!  Very fresh and hot!  Service was good too!  Servers seemed happy not just like they were tolerating being there!  GREAT parking lot!  And it's right off highway!"}
{"text":"Extremely Slow today cause of Labor Day!  I live in Vegas and came to the location today cause my friend wanted endless shrimp...when we were greeted at door by a female named Claudia she knew my friend who I find out goes on the regular here!  I work in the industry in Las Vegas Nevada and I've had the privilege to eat at some of the best restaurants in the world!!!'  I have never ever had better customer service in my life!   Please if ur a patron reading this ask for her....if ur a boss reading this please pat this women on the back, give her a raise or gift cards or something!  And the food was piping hot and fresh!  So yumma!  Thank you Claudia!"}
{"text":"I always get the Cajun chicken Alfredo the size is horrible I had to get a manager it was extremely small.  Chicken was dry and the sauce was overly oily.  They wanted to charge us for the pineapple coconut sauce that we always get with our biscuits.  My husband always gets the ultimate feast and substitutes fried shrimp for count shrimp today we are charged what???  Never coming back to this location."}
{"text":"Thx u John for making my experience so much more pleasurable than the other day... Excellent service"}
{"text":"We just arrived in Mesa for the winter and had to have the all you can eat shrimp. We were seated immediately and the waitress arrived a minute later. The drinks were served in good time. The ordering was easy and efficient with her answering our questions without a second thought. The meals arrived shortly after we finished our salads. Both were excellent. Our waitress look our shrimp refill order with the original order so my refill arrived just as I finished my first serving. I will admit that it was too much to eat but it was so good.  Our bill was presented after she was sure we were finished. Excellent food and excellent service - what more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"Service was great but as always the quality not the best. The pizza was soggy, crab cakes pretty bad would not try again. Fries were soggy. Atleast the quality of the biscuit and lobster is consistent. Average but consistent."}
{"text":"Yippee - 2 locations in Mesa. This one = YES The location on Southern = NO!  Oops. I mistakenly posted my review of the location on Southern here. Oh what a mistake. Went to the \"other\" one about a while back (and took a long time to ponder the review before I posted it). It was not a typical Red Lobster experience in any way.  Realized my mistake when we went to the Alma School location Friday night.  Very pleased here. Got the full - expected - Red Lobster experience. Greeted/seated politely and immediately. Server was prompt, polite and attentive. From the biscuits to the shrimp entrees to the endlessly refilled iced teas to the brownie dessert, everything was prepared and presented perfectly! The place was clean. The staff busied themselves cleaning up all over the dining floor when not serving customers. What an incredibly different experience.  We contacted RL corp about the experience on Southern. I was \"invited\" to speak with them by phone. No interest. Either apologize and make right right away or just move on. I'll never make the mistake of going in to the restaurant on Southern ever again.  Very pleased that the Alma School location was fully up to par. Faith in the chain restored. Time to ditch the GM from the other location."}
{"text":"Consistently friendly and clean.  Tried the new menu: dragon shrimp is  winner though a bit heavy on the sauce and not as attractively plated as their menu photo.  Skip the new lobster roll. This is a garden variety dinner roll with small bits of rubbery, over-cooked, saltwater tasting lobster.  Stick with their shrimp items. Not sure why Red \"Lobster\" can't cook a good lobster but they do a fine job with all the varieties of shrimp."}
{"text":"Red Lobster = Yes! This location = No!  Do NOT mistake this location for the one on Alma School. As different as day is from night.  Saturday night, prime time. Seated instantly. Nice people. Server pretty prompt to greet but slightly slow with the waters and teas. Dining area clean enough but far from ideal.  We are RL regulars so we get spiffs after spending so many $. And, there is a nice deal on their mobile app. The app. says that deals may be combined.  Orders placed for lobster/shrimp pizza appetizer, clam chowder, parmesan crusted tilapia and coconut shrimp. The appetizer was one of the best efforts from any RL location. Good sign. Soup and biscuits served instantly on top of the appetizer = not so cool. Biscuits first. Then appetizer, then soup then entrees. Don't know why this is so hard to get. Not like the place was packin' 'em in. And, the wait for the entrees was uncomfortably long after all the other items had been served all at one time. Not the best plan.  Soup is not as good as canned Campbell's. Bummer. FYI: previous tries of their lobster bisque at other locations are worthy of the same \"Campbell's\" comment. Broth too thick and very lacking in bits of lobster just as the chowder was very light on bits of clam.  I think the entrees sat under a heat lamp too long. Coconut crust on the shrimp was almost blackened. Mashed potatoes had a bit of a crust to them. Broccoli looked as if it had died a few days earlier. Not really happy. But, OK. The tilapia was OK. The shrimp themselves were good.  Eager to try their chocolate chip lava cookie for dessert for the first time. RU kidding me? the chocolate inside the cookie (edge burnt and hard) was solid. How does one manage to burn a cookie and not melt the chocolate? The ice cream is only so-so but that is expected.  Time to get the bill and a box for leftovers (tilapia, not the burnt shrimp). Oh no! The bill folio came inside the box intended for the leftovers. No. Just no. Not ever. Eww! Then came the refusal to allow the \"frequent diner\" points and the deal on their app. to be combined even though the language specifically says this is OK. Floor manager told server, \"no.\" Server comp'ed the app but the $ didn't line up. Nice try. Weak move on the part of the floor manager to stay away.  Oh, and just in case anyone from RL reads their Yelp reviews, let me add: There was a large family group seated for a birthday. The servers came, asked who the birthday person was and proceeded to do one of the most lifeless renditions of \"Happy Birthday!\" I've ever heard. And, they got the birthday person's name wrong! Ouch. (take the staff to a Texas Roadhouse and see what \"inspired\" staff look like.) We were seated near the kitchen: someone in there would let out a loud \"woo-hoo\" every now and again. No idea why. A fair number of dishes falling to the floor and breaking and not timed with the verbal exclamation. The plating of our entrees was so uninspired I can picture Gordon Ramsey taking the plates, smashing them on the floor and going on an F-bomb tirade. The kitchen crew isn't into their jobs. The post high-school aged servers were definitely interested in flirting with each other though.  Will definitely return to RL - after commenting to their corporate office about this visit not being up to what I expect of RL. But, not this location. Never again.  2 stars because the server was nice, pretty attentive and she did try to make things somewhat right on the bill. If not for that, then this would have been a 1 star for sure!"}
{"text":"One of the better, more consistent locations in the valley.  4 course weekday offer is a great value.   My favorite is the coconut shrimp. The full size dinner, not the tiny shrimp version. Somehow the seasoning is weird on the smaller shrimp.  Also good is Walt's favorite.  I don't understand why but the lobster offerings are always a miss as are the crab offerings.   The place is clean. The service is always good."}
{"text":"Yup. Happy with this location. Shrimp, lobster and crab all prepared well. Fair pricing. Friendly service."}
{"text":"Endless shrimp is a great invite in!  This location is pretty average for Red Lobster. Not a stand out. But, also well above some of the lesser of their locations around the valley. Friendly staff. Clean enough.  There is a not-so-secret \"secret menu\" for the endless shrimp. Look it up online. Sadly, it seems that the locations aren't all that keen on offering up these little insider treats. More often than not, valley-wide, during this current run of endless shrimp, the offerings have been slim leaving some of the best tasting options as \"sold out.\" I don't really get that since the part that matters is seasoning. And, often times, dry seasoning at that. Read: dry seasoning probably lasts a really long time!  Their \"four course\" weekday offering is also a reasonable deal. I don't know why they serve salad and soup together rather than one first, followed by the other. But, this is not fine dining so they are forgiven. Decent clam chowder always lacking in clams.   Definitely reasonable for the price."}
{"text":"Why the hell do I keep coming back to Red Lobsters?    My wife loves their chicken alfredo cajun pasta dish and she was craving it tonight.  We drove down and decided to check out the Surprise Red Lobster. We arrived around 4:15 and we were seated pretty quick.  That was one of the few good things I can say about this place.    Once we were seated, it took awhile for anyone to come over to greet us.  Our waitress stopped by about 5 minute later with a serving of their biscuits.  She did apologize for the delay and let us know that she would be back with us shortly.  Another 5 minutes pass and a different server comes over to get our drink orders.  A few minutes after that, a totally different dude drops off our waters but doesn't have my wifes iced tea.  Our original server eventually bought it over, but it still took like 15 minutes in the place before we had drinks in front of us.  Lame!  We had our son with us too and he started to get cranky.  It's damn near impossible to entertain an 18 month old if they are tired, cranky and hungry.  All this while, I could see servers, bus boys etc just chilling over by the drink station.  If you are going to work as a team, work as a damn team!  Don't have the waitress busting her ass with multiple tables while you guys chill and crack jokes in plain sight of everyone.  Anyways...........  We placed our orders right away and tried to keep our son busy.  Food came out in a decent amount of time (at least compared to the drinks) but it was still longer than usual.  I ordered their garlic butter mussels and my wife went with her usual of the chicken alfredo cajun pasta.  The food was alright.  We scarfed it down and took a lot of it to go because of our son getting cranky.    Doubt I would come back just because of the really slow service.  It wasn't even busy in there and service still lagged big time.  I couldn't imagine a Fri/Sat night after 6pm. Their prices have steadily gone up over the last few years, too.  Our bill was almost $40 bucks after tip for one meal, one appetizer and an iced tea.  Not worth it!"}
{"text":"First and probably last time I dine at this Red Lobster location.   Restaurant half empty and food took 45 minutes.  When food was brought out our less than spectacular server warned us that the plates were \"scorching hot\".   Translation:  \"I left your food in the window under the lights for 20 minutes while I did my closing duties\".   Oh yeah, and even with 45 minutes to properly prepare and plate our meal.... Forgot the grilled chicken for my son.   Then I had to wait for our server to reappear to pay the bill.    Caribbean shrimp/salmon was bland."}
{"text":"I had a bad experience at the Matthews NC location last week, so I decided to try this location and I must say it was about the same. Food was okay, I didn't really care for it but it was no fault of the restaurant because I tried something new. The service was slow............... Place wasn't clean but at the same time not dirty if that makes sense LoL. One thing that I was wowed about and that was the manager! I think her name was Cindy, however don't quote me. I do have a picture of her so look for her there. She was very pleasant, talkative, doing what she code to speed things up and keep them running smoothly. She was out front talking to guest as they wait and trying to make the wait not so bad. I saw her bouncing around doing some of everything which is different form the other locations I have visited. I will revisit and she is the only reason why."}
{"text":"Jeff Putney is the store manager, he is very genuine and if you have any problems he will definitely take care of you! I have had my share of problems at this location and Jeff has always taking care of me! I am changing my review from 1 star to 3 only because of Jeff. At the end of the day it's not about trying to get something for free but for me it's more about providing valuable feedback not only for the establishment but also for future guests. So before you strike Red Lobster off the list completely give Jeff a try!"}
{"text":"I have been to this location several time. This time it was Mother's Day and to be expected the place to as packed. Was told the wait would be 2 hours and it was only around 30 minutes or less! Kudos, to the staff for doing a good job and getting it done! The waiter we had was not rude but sort of weird. (See her in the pictures) She was very slow and almost seem like her mind was some place else. In fact while talking to her you would think it was was going in one ear and out the other. However everything we asked for she did, it was weird. As far as the food it's always pretty good for the most part. As I sat, I noticed a team member, smiling, cleaning, talking/interacting with the guest, just getting it done! I later found out her name is Christine and she's one of the managers! (See her in the photos) I called her over to my table and told her she is awesome, because she is! You can tell she is the manager by the way she moves, talks, works and everything else! She truly deserves a raise! I have visited several different Red Lobsters in the last few months and it's been a long time since I seen a team member perform the way she did. Kudos to Christine, keep up the good work. In fact I noticed several team members, being friendly to guest, smiling, talking etc. Team, keep doing what you do, because yes people do notice even if they don't say anything."}
{"text":"My family and I came here the other day and was VERY VERY happy about their service that they provided. We came in and got seated right away. Our waitress Linda was amazing. She kept that endless shrimp coming, and was sure that anything we needed, we got. She was happy and definitely seemed to love her job. I would recommend this red Lobster to anyone. and will be returning."}
{"text":"It is what it is. Looking for a quiet place for lunch with a friend. It wasn't horrible, but it wasn't amazing. It's a chain. It gets the job done.   Service was good. It was quiet for lunch. Prices were pretty high for dinner. You could go to better places for that cost. Lunch was ok on price.   I had lobster bisque, shrimp scampi, and broccoli. It was all ok. Nothing amazing. I would probably not go back, but if nothing else is appealing, it's an option."}
{"text":"Hmmm, I cannot say the food is bad but...the service is really unsatisfying. They arrange the seat closest to the restroom for us. I don't know if this is because we are Asian. Maybe I'm too sensitive...Anyway, I'm not a fan of either shrimp or lobster. So I won't come here again unless I have to."}
{"text":"Just kind of your standard Red Lobster/chain restaurant. Didn't have to wait too long for a table at like 9 PM on a Saturday night. Our waiter was super keen and friendly and accomodating, and made our dining experience very pleasant. Unfortunately, the food was just mediocre though. Two of us ordered off the Lobster Fest menu (i.e. lots of lobster tails) and one person got a set dinner with seafood spaghetti. This wasn't my first time at a Red Lobster (but my first time at this particular one), but everyone in my family noted that our food was EXTREMELY salty, I don't know what the cooks in the kitchen were doing, but they were super heavy handed with the salt/seasoning. Quite honestly I would say the best part of our meal was probably the biscuits we got at the beginning (they were amazing and unlimited), which is kind of sad."}
{"text":"The chain seafood is not very good and the service at this particular location is always slow even if the place is practically empty also this location always has a not so nice smell I don't recommend it but there aren't that many choices in Gastonia."}
{"text":"We had a gift card, which was the main motivation in going.  My son LOVES shrimp, so we went for his birthday.  I think the problem was that we were seated in the \"bar\" area.  Our server was the bartender.  The food was good for Red Lobster.  It took a while to get food, while to get drinking refills, and TOO long for check.  I still tipped my normal 15%, but not impressed."}
{"text":"We are regulars here and the consistent food quality stands out. The servers are always very friendly and helpful.  Eric always remembers what we like to eat and is very attentive. There is really nothing to complain about."}
{"text":"Ate crabfest crab linguine yesterday and got food poisoning ...my mom and sister had to send their  food back to get it fresh and it was still hard. Wont be back !"}
{"text":"I always passed by the restaurant and decided to give it ago.   - Food: It was lobsterfest so we had lobster lover's dream and lobster seafood pasta. For appetizer, we had seafood stuffed mushroom. lobster lover's dream's lobsters were good but the pasta was too bland. The lobster seafood pasta was also too bland so we had to add salt and pepper. Stuffed mushrooms were too salty. Overall for all the dishes, it needed some improvements in the pasta sauce, but there were generous amounts of seafood.   - Service: the waiter was extremely nice.   - Ambience: I would say the overall atmosphere's quite dark. It reminded me of old canadian family restaurant - well, it is.   I would not go back again but the service was nice."}
{"text":"We don't frequent chain restaurants as much any more due to the plethora of options here in Las Vegas. The commercials for crab fest, however, have owned my soul for a couple weeks now. Hunny decided that we'd visit this restaurant for our date night. SO glad we did! We were seated right away. Our server, Sydney, was amazing! She had awesome recommendations! Definitely try the signature drink and the appetizer! Everything was super yum! We will be back before the end of Crabfest!"}
{"text":"I got a table very quickly.  I had to send my fish back to be baked a bit longer, but I would rather it be that than over cooked."}
{"text":"We went on a typical Saturday night, so there was a wait. Once we were seated though, service was pretty slow and inconsistent. I had to ask multiple times for water, we asked for biscuits and every time a batch was made we saw other tables getting baskets but our server said \"we just ran out again!\" I ordered the platter with three kinds of shrimp which were mediocre. It wasn't bad, just not fantastic. Then I found that my shrimp linguine had little bits of lobster in it (which I'm allergic to.) The server pretty much didn't believe me. Said the manager would be over (he/she never did make it to our table!)"}
{"text":"I stop in now and then for their lobster bisque and the chedder biscuits. Apparently I became a regular and the bar tender starting sending my order to the kitchen before I got a chance to ask for it. That made me feel special. Saved the hassle of catching a waitress and placing an order. The only downfall with this restaurant is that it's always packed on Friday, Saturday and Sunday and I have to go extra early if I don't want to wait forever for a seat. Even the bar area is full."}
{"text":"Good service. Decent price. Good biscuits. - Make sure to ask where the best place for a 'quiet' dinner - the hostess (all three times) sat us next to a crying child and thrice did we ask to move. - No one likes that, no one."}
{"text":"Nothing says great seafood like Red Lobster!!! Ummm...just kidding. If you've been to one, you've been to 'em all. The service here is usually a bit better than average though."}
{"text":"its red lobster.. its butter.. what do you expect. Taste is good, but way over priced and we had a bitchy waitress. She wasn't even trying to be nice, it was brutal. I get it, anyone can have a bad day, but dont take it out on your customers. Come to think of it, she was probably my worst server in my entire life. I'm not exaggerating"}
{"text":"Variety of dishes we had mussels, seafood stuffed mushroom, artichoke dip, and sea side shrimp trio and lastly delicious desert vanilla bean cheesecake. Our server Sharif what a guy just down to earth he was so pleasant from food to service our visit was was awesome. I have been coming to this location more then 10 years"}
{"text":"Excellent Customer Service.  Good Food.   The waiter was very nice and professional, the only thing. We was greeting when we came in,  wasn't when we left.  But that's ok, The Manager and waitress made up for that.  Food was on point.     I must say I've was very Impressed."}
{"text":"Went to this Red Lobster with my family and had great food and great service. Definitely a fan of this location."}
{"text":"Yum yum yum.... Lobsterfest is back!!!   Yummy!  Til March 5!   The lobster surf and turf is awesome....especially with the NY strip!   So is the lobster lovers dream!!! Awesome!"}
{"text":"Awesome food, terrific servers, many are long-term!  Richard, the manager is fantastic and goes out of his way to be helpful.  Red lobster management, don't you DARE take Richard away from us.....I know how you looove to move your managers around!  Not this one!  Okay?  Can't wait for lobsterfest......coming Feb 1.  Haven't even seen any ads to show what's coming.  That's disappointing!  Great store.  Keep up the great work.  Also, LOVE the new booths, very comfy."}
{"text":"Family and I go to the Surprise location every so often and always have a great time. We always seem to get the same server, which is completely fine with me. I think her name is Karen. She's very friendly and always goes the extra mile to make are that we're having a great night. The food is almost always amazing, as well. We had one hiccup with the temperature of some of or seafood, but the manage took care of it once we brought to up to Karen. Overall great experiences!"}
{"text":"Came back to Red Lobster after being away for about five years. Because I have celiac disease I have to eat gluten free. Craig and I had eaten there many times in that past and had wonderful meals. They've changed the way they do their gluten free options. Very bland and tasteless. The staff tried to be more than accommodating. The fish came out looking like it had been boiled in water.  No salt, no pepper, no lemon, no oil - it's wasn't palatable.  It's such a shame.  GF can be made to taste amazing. I would call my family and I \"Foodies\",  so this type of food just doesn't cut it.  Just because I  have a gluten intolerance does not mean I don't like flavor!!"}
{"text":"Every time I go to Red Lobster, I usually leave wishing there were more choices for seafood in the valley.  The quality of the food is not close to the price.  It's as  simple as that."}
{"text":"We visited this location today for an early supper. We arrived around 3 pm. The restaurant was about half full. We were seated immediately. The restaurant was clean, all the tables were set-up, and there were no dirty tables in site.  Shortly after being seated we were very politely greeted by our server, Taj. He was very friendly and professional. He introduced himself and asked what we would like to drink and if we needed any help with our selections on the menu.  Our drinks arrived quickly, and our orders were taken accurately.  The butter biscuits were brought out quickly and replaced when empty, they were warm and moist and lovely - cause lets be honest. That's why anyone goes to Red Lobster, is for those buttery cheesy garlicky biscuits.  Our salads were brought out right away, which we were very thankful for because we were all starving.  Our entrees were brought out, and everything was flawless.  My friend and I ordered the \"Seaport Lobster and Shrimp\" which came with a maritime lobster tail, and a shrimp skewer, and an order of garlic shrimp. Everything was cooked perfectly, and tasted fantastic.  My boyfriend ordered a grilled chicken sandwich, I know I know, but he doesn't like seafood.  He ate it all up and said everything was perfectly cooked and yummy.  Taj checked in with us often, and was so polite, even excusing himself for having to interrupt our conversation, which we really appreciated. We were very impressed with his service.  We didn't order dessert as we were all so full, but the menu looked fantastic.  All in all, we had a great experience and left full and happy. Our server was fantastic.  Between three people, we spent about $100 including tips, but we were very happy with everything. We will defiantly be back!"}
{"text":"Funny, I love nice restaurants and great food and everyone makes fun of me for liking Red Lobster. This place reminds me of a late family member and the staff are friendly as can be. The food is good for what you pay for it. We will be back."}
{"text":"Red Lobster.  Aargh. For whatever reason, Red Lobster and I have just never gotten along. When Grandma C says she wants to go to Red Lobster I usually ask to stay home. My son C drags me along probably for some comic relief. Comic Relief, seriously! They didn't need me for comic relief, the laugh was the sign on the front door indicating that their credit card system was down and that it could possibly take 20 minutes for the staff to process each card used to pay. Hmmm. Why would any manager put that kind of sign on the door? No, no, no. Yes, you should let the public know but don't tell them it could take 20 minutes. The only reason you do that is to turn people away. And the only reason you turn people away is because you're lazy. Calling a processing center and telling the agent your system is down is easy. Keeping the agent on the line while you process the cards is also easy. Regardless, I just thought the sign was funny. We of course continued in. The place was not very busy. Shocking, after seeing the sign on the door.  I guess a lot of people got scared at the thought of waiting 20 minutes for their bill to get processed. Our server was Christel. She did a great job keeping our drinks filled, checking on us and pacing the meal properly. Nicely done. Grandma C and C both ordered Fried Shrimp under the Endless Shrimp promotion ($16.99). They both got fries with their meals and ate up most of the shrimp. Was the shrimp perfect? No. Some of the shrimp was overcooked but overall, they did a decent job. Plus, they could reorder as much as they wanted. Both G.C. and C got Raspberry Lemonades ($2.89) as well. Pricey. K ordered the Habanero Coconut Bites and Coconut Shrimp bites under the endless Shrimp promotion. ($16.99). Again, all the shrimp was prepared ok. Some was overly breaded but most were not. There were plenty of each so portion size is not an issue. K also got a baked potato with toppings on the side.  K enjoyed them. I ordered the Coconut Shrimp Bites and Grilled Teriyaki Shrimp under the promo, ($16.99). I felt my coconut shrimp was just ok. There were a few pieces that were heavily covered in the coconut breading. The grilled Teriyaki Shrimp was fine, nothing special although it is served with rice pilaf. The rice however was a bit undercooked. I ordered the baked potato as my side with the topping on the side. Nothing wrong with the potato.  Again, there was plenty of shrimp included plus as much as I wanted to reorder. Not bad. K and I both got Iced Tea ($2.59). Why is it 30 cents less than the lemonade, must be the cost for the Raspberry flavoring. Seems like a McDonalds thing to do, charging for flavorings or sauce packets. I will say that my favorite thing at Red Lobster is the Cheddar Biscuit. Yum. When these bad boys are warm and the butter melts over the steamy hot biscuit, heaven.  Another plus is each meal comes with a choice of salad and two sides. Not bad.  Good service, good food, fair prices. 3 Stars."}
{"text":"Not much of a fan of chain restaurants, but when it's Friday and you don't want to cook and seafood is on your brain, why not?  I've been to this location a handful of times and we've always been treated very well here. Again - not a chain restaurant fan, but when you have a 6 year old in tow, sometimes it's the best option.  The cocktails were spot-on. I rarely, if ever, buy cocktails out but for whatever reason, I felt like a Mojito. My husband had some fruity concoction that was also very tasty,  Cheddar Bay Biscuits - nothing needs to be said about these things - they are in a class of their own.   I ordered the New Orleans Salmon (blackened salmon with shrimp sauce and a pico de gallo, served with mashed potatoes and roasted Brussels Sprouts). I got the half order and it was MORE than enough for this big girl. Very nicely done - I will definitely order this again.  My husband ordered a steam pot which he enjoyed, although he did admit he liked my plate better (he always does).   The waitress was very accommodating and treated our kid like a kid and bantered back and forth with her and made her feel like it was HER special night out. A gentleman came by towards the end of our meal and thanked us for coming - he was super nice."}
{"text":"Red Lobster was once a wonderful place to have a nice seafood dinner. Gone are the tanks that held live lobsters in therm. The famous chalkboard listing the fresh catches are now given to you as a menu addition.  To avoid lines we arrived in the middle of the day. I had a $4.00 coupon for my friend and I to share with our meals. My girlfriend noted to me that the prices recently increased. Also there is no WiFi there.  They were running a dinner special for $16.99 which included soup, salad, certain seafood entrees, and a dessert. My girlfriend ordered that. I opted for the flounder stuffed with crab meat. You are still served those buttery biscuits to start. My friend had clam chowder, Caesar salad, garlic shrimp, and caramel cheesecake for dessert.  i was served two pieces of the flounder with broccoli which was filling and not to bad.Our waiter was friendly but when he gave us the check we saw he didn't honor the coupon we had. We called him back and said to deduct the $4.00 off the total. We corrected him by saying the $4.00 comes off before tax so he estimated the reduction for us.  I also noted as I'm beginning to see in other Darden establishments that the check leaves the suggested amount of tipping down to a penny science.  I will only dine here when asked. It is not a place that I would normally pick out for my self  Please note that if is difficult to park sometimes because there are other restaurants in this off street area that are very popular."}
{"text":"Generally the food is always great. Usually get a pound of snow crab and it's cooked perfectly. Many months ago, it was dry and overcooked. Aside from one bad serving, I'm generally pleased with the food quality. (Prices do seem a bit high, but it's a chain and red lobster has never been a \"cheap\" restaurant).  My suggestion is to have consistent service. Rarely do we have wait staff that seem enthused or happy to be there. Even when getting a waiter that is decent at keeping drinks filled, knowing the menu, etc, they seem like they'd rather be elsewhere.  If Red Lobster wants my return business, the wait staff needs to act like they enjoy their job. The good food and location are the only reasons I've returned multiple times. Will be happy to choose another seafood restaurant if the wait staff is, at best, mediocre"}
{"text":"Oh Red Lobster, while I may not see you much, everytime I do its just like I remember it...mostly.   The price went up a little bit but you get a lot of food so it's pretty decent. The cheddar biscuits are a staple as well as my damn shirley temple.  The food came out hot & perfectly cooked and filled me up which is a must and didn't fail. The admirals feast or the ultimate feast you can't go wrong with as they both have a great variety.   The lady who served us though never came around to refill our drinks so that sucked, the food was great, just don't come for the service. When I'm back in town I'll def be back....."}
{"text":"We had a perfect dining experience on Friday, August 4, 2017 at this Red Lobster location.  Our server was Randy B and he was very accommodating, totally familiar with the entire menu, and was back often to check on us,  Our meals were excellent, and because Randy discovered we were celebrating my birthday, brought us a complimentary big scoop of ice cream for us to share with raspberry garnish written the words Happy Birthday.  Thank you Randy!"}
{"text":"Do not eat here! I had an allergic reaction from what I assume is their new to go boxes and the GM Danielle only wanted to interrogate me and treated me like I was lying about my visit and reaction. I had zero issues the night we dined however when I ate my left overs bam! Instant swelling. I would question their sanitation and cleanliness if I were you!"}
{"text":"You know....I haven't been to a Red Lobster in a number of years. And my memory escapes me as to why that was. We had a gift card to use so we had dinner at Red Lobster last night.  I'm not sure what I ate but I got pretty sick. It lasted me all the way til the next day. I ordered a dish that came with lobster tail, salmon, brocoli, and shrimp that came in the wood fire style, and ordered a side of scallops as well. Everything tasted fine. It wasn't spectacular, just okay. What I enjoyed was our server, who was super attentive and friendly, and that makes me want to rate the place 4.5 stars. But I can't place my finger on what it was I had that made me so sick. The place was clean, the entrees did come a little sooner than we liked because we were still trying to enjoy our apps. The only thing that really wowed me and won me over were the cheddar bay biscuits. Lol. They were so tasty. I'm not sure I'd come back, though, without having a gift card needing to be used."}
{"text":"No one likes waiting 30 minutes to be greeted, and then 18 more minutes to get a drink, never getting biscuits, and having your appetizer and entrees placed in front of you at the same time.  Also, really don't appreciate the general manager accusing us of trying to skip out on the bill just because his server misplaced a credit card.  It's ok to make mistakes, but it's not ok to not accept that the mistake was your own and blame it on those who make your paychecks possible.  There are plenty of other fabulous places to dine in Concord...this may not be the place for you if you enjoy being treated like a valued guest."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good, but service was bad.    We waited 15 minutes to be seated, which isn't bad for any sit down place in this area. We got our drinks and shared appetizer pretty quickly.  And then we had time to kill.  A lot of it.  As we were sitting there with an under one year old baby, a lot of waiting time seems even longer.  Salads came with our meals, and by the time our salads came out, I had actually forgotten we had them coming. It had been a long time since our appetizer was finished, and I was expecting the meals by then.  But no such luck.  We ate our salads and waited some more.  We eventually decided that since it had been an hour since ordering, we would ask for boxes to take our shrimp home.  I had actually stood up with the baby to go wait in the car when our food FINALLY arrived. We still asked for boxes since by this time baby was getting tired (and frankly so were we), and this seemed to startle and be inconvenient for our server.  I took a few bites before boxing up my food, and while it wasn't cold, it wasn't really hot either.  I have to wonder if our order was put in late and then forgotten when it was done.  The taste was fine, but wow did we wait forever.  My husband was never even able to get a refill on his drink.  You'd think one refill in over an hour wouldn't be too much to ask.  Our server was friendly enough on the rare occasion she sped by (saying a few words as she passed), but we were pretty well neglected. So if you don't mind sitting forever with an empty glass, go for it!  I don't think we'll be going back to this location."}
{"text":"Not the best food and over priced glad we weren't spending our money,we had a gift card , service was great."}
{"text":"It's been over 10 years since either my hubby or I have stepped foot inside a Red Lobster. On this day, I was craving their cheesy bread and the hubby wanted Maine Lobster. We bellied up at the bar and our waitress Sherry was AMAZING!! She gave us her recommendations for dinner and I am so happy we took it. The Maine Lobster was cooked perfectly and my hubby was good. I had the ceasar salad and the Bar Harbor Bake. The food was great and we where very surprised on why we haven't come to Red Lobster a long time ago. We will definitely come back, but definitely request Sherry to be our server. She goes above and beyond to give you an amazing dining experience with a smile.  Thank you Red Lobster and a big thank you to Sherry."}
{"text":"Red lobster has never let me down. The baked potato soup was very delicious, the service was great, very friendly server who was checking up on us constantly and making sure we had everything we needed. I will be back"}
{"text":"Did take out because we had gift cards from Xmas. Otherwise, we'd never eat here. 7 fries???!!! My son had chicken fingers and they gave him 7 fries! Our honey maple chicken was like leather, and the clam chowder was CRUNCHY! No thank you, especially since there is NO Togo parking!!!!!"}
{"text":"I saw the mixed reviews and I was wary up in going. I'm glad we did! The wait staff, (Destiny H., being our server), was very attentive. Big A+ for Destiny. She did not disappoint! Our food, when it arrived , was hot, flavorful, with nice proportions, cooked and seasoned well. We were very satisfied and will definitely return again and will also recommend this to all of our friends and family."}
{"text":"Ok,been going to this Restaurant for years,And haven't been dating for the last two years,started talking to this man on the internet a couple months ago.We met there Friday the 20th of February,he brought me a dozen red roses,since we was having such at great time at our first meeting,I forgot the flowers there after dinner we went somewhere esle ok Monte Carlo to be exact,I drove so after leaving Monte carlo he asked where is the red roses I brought you for our first date,I said oh my gosh I must have left them at Red Lobster,tried to call them but they where closed,so the very next morning I called at 11am,Here's my thought any establishment that you leave something at you should have at least 24 hours to claim whatever it may be,well talked to a lady employee there the next day which was Saturday and have called the manager twice no one has returned my calls,I also spoke to the manager tonight March 3 2015,he informed me he has to speak with Julie says it's his boss, and by the way the night in question I ordered a 3lb Lobster just boiled or steamed and they brought me a over cooked stuffed lobster that was horrible ,but didn't want to complain because after all it was my first date after speaking to this gentelmen for two months getting to know him,there will be no second date.Want to ask you guys out here on the internet do you agree you should have at 24 hours to claim anything you leave at any Restaurant or Bar any estalblishment no matter what the item is please response on my Facebook if you agree at Vickie lynn martinez Thank You Looking forward to responses"}
{"text":"The service was terrible. People including us waiting over an hour to just get a table. Multiple tables open. Short staffed maybe? Average time at a table 1hr 45 min.

My boyfriend got the cheeseburger said he was impressed it tasted good and was fully cooked lol. for me I got the sailors plate my fish was over cooked a little bit but the shrimp scampi and fried shrimp was good but don't get the rice, was chewing and not cooked right. Needless to say are server was really nice and helpful. Also don't get sick from anything is a plus"}

{"text":"UPDATE: had the most disappointing experience here tonight. Decided to go to this Red Lobster after a long evening. I was starved, it was my birthday, and the 3 of us agreed in this place. We arrived by about 8:00 so there was no waiting for a table. We were seated immediately and had our orders taken promptly by our friendly waiter. So far so good. We chose not to order an appetizer since it was already late, figuring a salad and dinner would be plenty so late into the evening. Here's where it starts to go down hill. Strike 1-Our salads arrived, but we didn't have any silverware.  Had to request silverware. Then noticed that my salad had wilting, dark, aging leaves. More than one was found. Yuck.  After we were finished with our salads, he asked if we'd like anymore biscuits but we declined, trying to save room for our meal.  Strike 2-we wait, AND WAIT for our food. 30 minutes go by and still nothing. Out waiter finally comes over to apologize for the mess up. He forgot to put our orders in, but he just did, so it shouldn't be too long before they're ready.  During this time we see 3 other sets of guests who are seated, ordered and received their food.... as we wait, and wait.  Strike 3-Our waiter never checked in with us to offer any more biscuits or ANYTHING, as an \"I'm sorry for the mistake, what can I do to satisfy you in the meantime\" during our long wait. Nothing.  Strike 4- Our food finally arrives. It's been about a 45 minute wait from the time our salad plates had been cleared til our entrees were brought out.  Strike 5- waiter forgets a cup of soup that was ordered.  By now, we're just eager to eat and get out and go home.  Strike 6- offered one of us a lemonade refill, but forgot to bring it. Never checked on the rest of our drinks  or offered to refill them. Our glasses were empty before our meal was finished, and they stayed that way.  Food was basically as I rated previously. Overly salted, nearly swimming in oil and on top of that, it was super late.  Our waiter apologized and said he was going to take the soup off our bill and give us a free dessert if we'd like to make up for the mistake.  I'm sorry, but in a situation like this I would expect the wait person to speak with the manager and offer a free meal or something.... not a free cup of soup.  I'm not one to normally criticize waitstaff, because I know they work hard and customers can be rude and impatient, but I really felt like we were not taken care of during this visit. I don't know if our waiter was new, tired, or just unaware, but I don't think we'll be back to this restaurant anytime soon.  Not a memorable birthday dinner by any means."}
{"text":"Went for Lobster fest. The waitress was excellent and the good was very good. Overall a good experience."}
{"text":"Went for Crab Fest and after reading the menu I selected crab cakes topped with shrimp. I LOVE crab cakes! These had absolutely NO crab in them! They were a soggy pile of cereal filler! I was so very disappointed! Thanks Red Lobster for ruining my Birthday Dinner  :( !"}
{"text":"Pretty good over priced food and expected its seafood but I'd only give this place three stars because it's your typical franchise you get service as if you were going through a McDonalds drive thru window your just missing the fast part. Server had no idea what kinda fish he bright out he was asked by a member of our party what kind of trout he was being served and our waiter replied with \"uhmmmm yah I think it's rainbow but I don't know that's a good question!\" and I'm thinking yeah go ask someone? But no he just continued to linger at our table as if he was going to take his lunch break with us. There was more annoying little things that occurred but you get my point maybe?"}
{"text":"I gave 5 stars just for SERDAR's service. Food was good, usual Red Lobster quality but the service put our experience over the top. The restaurant was busy you could tell that the staff was stretched thin. Serdar took the time to make sure my friends and I had everything we needed. He was very attentive and friendly. Thanks man!"}
{"text":"Love going here. Great food and service is always top notch. Q was out waiter today and was nice and friendly."}
{"text":"Our server Justin M. Is the one you want. Attentive, great smile and personality. Food was hot and delicious. We ordered the coconut shrimp for an app. An shrimp salad wraps for main course. I had a Virgin Mojito and Mom had Sutter Home Chardonnay. Delish with great service."}
{"text":"We went to the Red Lobster at Carolina Place this past weekend. The quantity of the food was great; quality was adequate. Service was abysmal. Just as an example, our server brought our ticket to the table. 15 minutes later, she ambled by to pick up the ticket with our credit card. 10 minutes later, she finally brought it back for me to sign. This was after an hour-and-a-half dining experience which should have taken half the time but due to our waitress' slowness and lack of attention, was stretched into painful wait times. Never received a refill on my soda. This was not during prime time, either - we arrived around 4:30PM on Saturday.  As far as the food went, it was good - I had the Admiral's Feast, which I took half of home because it was so much. My wife had the Crab Feast, which she did enjoy. The Cheddar Bay biscuits made up for much, but if I get in the mood for those again, I may just phone in an order and pick it up.  I just hope our server never goes to a zoo; I would hate for her to get dizzy watching the speed of the tortoises there.  As far me, I'm going to give this location a miss moving forward."}
{"text":"Food was just not good. Red lobster has definitely fallen off. Higher prices with smaller portions and average tasting food. We definitely will not be going. The two stars was for our server."}
{"text":"Why why why do I do this to myself?. Here is a chain with a uniqie formula for nationals - seafood, but they constantly miss the mark.    I dare the executives of this chain to eat there, not just this one, but any R-L.  The service is OK, the decore, cleanleness, --all fine.  But the menu and quality of the food is just not worth the calories...so much potental, so little fulfillment."}
{"text":"I had the delightful pleasure of trying out the new Lobsterfest menu at the kick-off party. It was a night I'll never forget. Red Lobster put the show on! Plate after plate after plate of meals came out. I missed the part on the invitation that said, \"Come ready to eat enough meals for the rest of your life.\"    In the end the cheesy biscuits did me in. Gosh darn it!  Complete Amateur Hour. If you've been to Red Lobster you are familiar with this breaded heavenly temptation. Unfolding napkins to the scent of bread is one thing. Slowly savoring the rich gooey cheese is...well...a moment you have to experience.   I should have known better!   The Short Review: + Good Food served in generous portions! + Funny welcoming staff + Kick butt drinks  STARTERS Out came a plate of stuffed mushrooms (6 pieces), decadently overfilled with lobster, crab and seafood topped with Monterey Jack cheese and baked. If you can, take a peek at my photos. (This advice applies to all of the food I'm going to cover. Words will not suffice here. Seriously!)   If you're looking for something with a kick the Sweet Chili Shrimp is for you! (12 pieces) It was for me. I absolutely loved the combination of light crunch and spice. It's not a hard crunch battered shrimp which is what I would have assumed if I was reading from the menu.  Out came the Lobster Pizza. Perfectly thin crust and topped with generous amounts of lobster meat, mozzarella, fresh tomatoes and basil. The crust was perfectly balanced and not overwhelmed by the ingredients. (No sogginess!) I could readily see this being a meal for someone. You're still getting the \"Lobster\" experience and plenty of food.   DRINKS We must pause at this juncture to discuss drinks. As my +1 and I had arrived prior to the start of the event we cozied up to the bar. (He also drove. Blessedly. I was able to sample many wonderful things.) With high recommendations I dived into the Bahama Mama. Tall, fruity, Captain Morgan Spiced Rum. They leave a reserve of Captain at the top of the drink. So when you think you're done drinking, no. There's a special kick just waiting for you. Delicious!  Moving into the special guest dining room armed with TWO drink tickets I was beside myself. \"Really? We can pick *anything* in the drink book menu? ANYTHING?\" Jeanne, our bomb diggity server, offered advice and answered many questions. Ultimately I wanted to compare a drink with my growing up roots. That's right. I went with a Top-Shelf Long Island Ice Tea. A premium blend of Absolut, Tanqueray, Bacardi and Patrón Citrónge.   The bartenders know what they're doing.  Later. (Much later.) I was tempted into ordering the largest looking margarita in history. Grand Patrón Margarita served with a cute sidecar of Grand Marnier. As we were attempting to photograph the ginormous nature of this treasure I was photobombed by a South African. All of the staff on hand, front to back, were super cool. We had a rip roaring time.  THE BAR Sitting at the bar, however brief our time was there, was neat. It's a big u-shape and central to the restaurant. If you have time to kill before your reservation there's ample seating. + TV!  BACK TO THE FOOD Remember, we ate tons! I was tired. But I channelled my inner gym monologue often, \"Suck it up Irene! Keep eating!\" (Also, the staff sent us home with shopping bags of doggie bags of food. My +1 scored big time as he took my goodies home!)  Dueling Lobster Tails. \"Where do I start? Traditional roasted with creamy shrimp and garlic sauce? Or stuffed with crab and seafood? Which one will I like better? There's mash potatoes!\"   After pausing for a nano-sec.  \"- And string beans. Not going to waste any space on those!\" Well, I did try the string beans because I felt guilty. Everything was wonderful. This meal is perfect for someone who isn't quite sure what they want. I had no idea there was still so much food to come.  Bar Harbor Lobster Bake. A roasted split Maine lobster tail, tender shrimp, sea scallops, mussels and linguini in a garlic and white wine broth. My Martha Stewart wanna be instantly thought, \"Hey. You could totally pick this up and pass it off as a creation of your own. Toss it in a nice bowl and maybe a fella will be sufficiently impressed by your \"cooking\" Irene.\"  Hey. If I stock the right beer fridge men believe anything. The mussels were my favorite part in this. Of course everything was delicious. I adored the mussels. They were perfectly prepared and not overly done. If I time the pickup perfectly a future date will think I'm an excellent cook. (Shhh!)  Lobster Lovers Dream. Butter makes the world go round. Two very different styles of lobster + alfredo pasta.  Ultimate Surf & Turf Must do this again. A Maine lobster tail baked with crab and seafood stuffing. Peppercorn seasoned grilled sirloin topped with Maine lobster meat in a citrus hollandaise sauce.   Dessert came. I put my head down. Try the key lime pie."}
{"text":"We have not been to Red Lobster in a while, but based on memory I expected better.  We both ordered the sailors platter for lunch with shrimp and broiled flounder.  The flounder was tasteless and inedible - possibly under-cooked.  The breaded shrimp was better, broiled shrimp seemed to be under-cooked also.  The best part of the meal was the biscuits which no longer arrive in advance, but with the meal.  Frankly - if the quality of this entree is not up to par with their more lucrative offerings, it should be taken off the menu.  While the manager and server briefly asked how the meal was, we merely smiled till they passed, preferring to vote with our feet.  Had they been even slightly observant they would have noticed the uneaten portions.  Complaining for some people is uncomfortable, and I'm sure cooks are not please to have their skills critiqued.  This may have been a rare event, but conversations with others rendered the same opinion.  c'est la vie"}
{"text":"Service here is excellent but the food is so-so. But that's expected of Red Lobster. Expect overpriced seafood along with delicious biscuits. If you like Red Lobster, this is definitely a good place to go."}
{"text":"Got sat in a booth with a very dirty floor. We didn't get silverware until minutes after we got our food. I was asked if I wanted my soup out at the same time as my friends food to which I said yes but ended up getting my soup way after. Got brought out the wrong dish at first however. Also had to ask for the complimentary biscuits which should have just been brought out. However the food was delicious, and so was my Bloody Mary."}
{"text":"I have always enjoyed meals at Red Lobster, this visit was even sweeter. The waiters were prompt, very nice and the food was really delicious. The biscuits are always mouth watering and warm. I had a caesar salad with shrimp linguini. I will definitely return to try more delectable items."}
{"text":"It's always nice when you order a meal at $28 dollars and when you get it home you find out they sent the wrong order. Incompetent staff. Get your act together."}
{"text":"Listen: I'm not going to mention the biscuits because we've all heard quite enough about the biscuits. \"You're going to Red Lobster? I luuuurve their cheesy biscuits.\" Yeah, I know. Everyone likes the biscuits. Enough about the biscuits.  And it's of course redundant to discuss the quality of the seafood here. But what I can say about this Bay and Dundas location is that the service is superb. A friend and I showed up on a rainy weeknight with a bus to catch and a short window of time in which to eat. They accommodated us wonderfully. If you must eat Red Lobster, try this one!  Obligatory Title Pun: Maybe they should call it: \"I love the BREAD\" lobster.  Menu Readability: Like Swiss Chalet's but with seafood.  Need to mention: It's located right across from the bus terminal.  What this place teaches me about myself: If there is a seafood lover in me, he is forever being jostled by the biscuit lover in me."}
{"text":"We went in for dinner and endless shrimp. This is only our 2nd visit to this location but its is nicely decorated, clean and comfortable. Jana was out waitress on this visit and she did an excellent job taking care of us. Don't you just love it when your server can anticipate your needs?  The food was good. Hubby had the endless shrimp and loved them all. I had steak and snow crab. The crab was delish but the steak was a little tough. May have been the cut because it was cooked and seasoned well. Overall good food, great service and that made it a wonderful night."}
{"text":"Considering that I've been going to Red Lobster since I was in grade school, I would have to say that I think that this was the best Red Lobster I have ever had.  The Lobster Nachos were scrumptious!  The salad was crisp and fresh, and the entrees came out swiftly with the presentation being grand!  My husband and I ate off of each others plates, and nothing I tasted was less than great!  The palate was satisfied and stomach full when I left!"}
{"text":"Visited this location on my birthday, May 8th. Which was also Mother's day too... Came in at around 6pm and the wait was an hour and a half. I guess that was expected given the date. So, I just waited in my car until the buzzer thingy they gave me went off.  Once inside I was seated at a booth and ordered the \" Ultimate Feast\" with a caesar salad, and an iced tea. The cheesy bread was so freaking good! I ate a whole tray prior to my actual meal arriving. I saved the 2nd batch for my plate. The wait was sort of long, but again it was mothers day. My plate came in around 20-25 minutes. I tore it to shreads since I love seafood. The rock lobster was a bit overcooked by a minute or two. But nonetheless I enjoyed eating it ever sooooo slowly. Once finished 3 employees, including my waitress brung me a huge scoop of vanilla ice cream with a lit candle inside and sang me happy birthday. AWESOME."}
{"text":"Came here Monday night for an early Valentine's Day dinner and it was super packed! The wait time was about 20-25 minutes (which wasn't bad) but my boyfriend and I decided to have drinks at the bar until we were called.   To start off, the service was excellent. Our waitress was so kind, and gave us recommendations based on what we told her. She also came often to ask how we are and if we needed anything.   The food was amazing!! For an appetizer, we got the jumbo coconut shrimp, this was okay, but probably won't get it on my next visit. For my main dish, I got the rock lobster tail w/ Caesar salad, broccoli and mashed potatoes. Wow, the lobster was so good that I was even craving it the day after. Also, the biscuits are amazing!"}
{"text":"Once upon a time last year, I read a Buzzfeed article ranking free restaurant bread: http://www.buzzfeed.com/laraparker/the-definitive-ranking-of-free-restaurant-bread#.qmD34J1xDR  Number 1 on that entertaining list were the Cheddar Bay Biscuits at Red Lobster; hmmmm, really?  I couldn't remember ever having those biscuits much less even remember the last time I ate at a Red Lobster.  So, I resolved to add that to my list of places to try just to see for myself because YOLO and all that. Fast forward almost a year and I finally got to try the biscuits courtesy of the b/f's gift card; we just never made RL a priority eating destination until then and probably won't be again for a long time.   First of all, we dined here on a Thursday night.  B/f arrived first and put our names in  at 7:00pm and was quoted a wait time of 20-30 minutes.  I arrived around 7:50pm from an appointment with a bloodmobile, famished.  B/f was still sitting in the waiting area.  We didn't get seated until a little after 8:00pm and probably only because the b/f went back to the hostess to see what the heck was taking so long.  I've heard that the wait times are horrible at RL, but really?   We think they forgot us because we were then seated immediately.  Cheddar Bay Biscuits:  The time had come and....they ARE good.  My first impression of the biscuit was that it was salty, probably from the cheese.  But, then you get the flakiness of the biscuit and its flavor is very tasty.  However, I wouldn't rank them #1 of the restaurant bread that I've had.  Yes, Buzzfeed lists are not scientific, I know.  I'm just sayin'--I love bread and I think I need butter with mine.  Maybe I should have asked for some!  I ate more than one biscuit and they are definitely a plus for RL.  4-Course Feast $17.99:  this seemed like the obvious choice for me because for the price, I got soup (Clam chowder), salad (Caesar), entree choice (Jumbo Coconut and Spicy Pineapple-Grilled Shrimp), and dessert (Triple-Chocolate Brownie a la mode).   The chowder is good with the biscuits, just like the b/f said.   I must note that our server, Andy, did a fine job throughout the evening and brought the b/f a complimentary bowl of chowder because I had to wait for a fresh batch to be made.  Caesar salad is okay, nothing special.  I liked the Coconut shrimp more than the Pineapple-Grilled shrimp since the latter were tiny and not grilled enough.   I was too full from biscuits to eat the dessert, but Andy had it boxed up, including the vanilla ice cream and some chocolate sauce.  Overall, I don't think the unlimited Cheddar Bay biscuits or the food are worth the notorious long wait times at this place.  Maybe it was just a fluke that night, but the food is not all that for over an hour of waiting.  P.S.   If you ask me, the best unlimited free restaurant bread (with butter!) can be had at our local pizza chain, M#$%o Pizza, but that's just me."}
{"text":"Delicious food and awesome customer service, can't get any better !! Best location so far"}
{"text":"To be honest, I am thinking this Red Lobster needs a facelift and some new staff.   The booth we sat in was busted in the seat - really need to do a modern update to the decor.   Service was just OK, but I have had a lot better at other places. Nice but not going out of their way to please anyone.  Food was good, I had the rainbow trout, blackened, very good. My son got 1 pound of Snow Crabs - I think for a child the portion size is huge along with the price of $18.99!   My son had the all you can eat shrimp which ended last night, that might be a good thing. Price didn't pay for the quality of the shrimp.  We will go back, but no time soon if I can help it."}
{"text":"Our server Rachael helped make our dining experience great! Cold crunchy salad, & a piping hot seafood entry made my day!  Awesome food coupled with an excellent server equals a fabulous evening!  Thanks Red Lobster!"}
{"text":"We usually find the food at Red Lobster decent.  This was the first time at this location and the food just did not taste good at all.  The service was friendly but could be a little more attentive in my opinion as it did not seem too busy that night either.  I had the Boston Bake and everything just tasted bland.  A little disappointed that night In general as we don't have a Red Lobster close to home so had to drive a little distance to get here.  I would not come back for the food here."}
{"text":"First and for most SIT IN LINDA'S SECTION!  She was amazing! Great recommendations on top of her service being outstanding! When we were unsure she brought a second server, Stanley to confirm that her meal choice was number 1. The atmosphere was great and food better than expected. We were seated quickly and Linda made sure to make us feel like her main focus."}
{"text":"They need to clean the carpets or just wash down the entire place, smelled bad as soon as you walked in the door. The food was greasy and the fish not that great. The service was good but that's about it"}
{"text":"We came here a few times by ourselves and with other guests. We usually only visit Red Lobster if there is a deal going on, like endless shrimp or the 4-course meal. It gets extremely busy at night and they don't take reservations, so expect waits of 20-30 minutes (this is the same at any other location).  For the 4-course meal, I had: New England clam chowder (yum!) Caesar salad Shrimp alfredo linguine (very yummy because the alfredo sauce was very rich) Key lime pie (yum)  I was stuffed halfway through the linguine, but needed to make room for dessert. Needless to say I was uncomfortably full.  For endless shrimp, I tried 4 options: garlic, garlic and cheese, teriyaki, and breaded. The best was the teriyaki. On reordering, we asked to skip the rice that comes with the teriyaki. Although you probably can consume more by only ordering the garlic, I thought it was too garlicky. The breaded shrimp was also tasty. Skip the shrimp linguine, since the carbs will make you full. I have heard of people consuming 100+ shrimps, so I kept a count. I was defeated at a paltry 53.  Service was okay for a Red Lobster, given that they're very busy. We had to ask for some basic things like utensils and water."}
{"text":"Again I am disappointed. I go here about once a year because I forget how much it has slidden down the quality path. Today was my yearly visit because I was craving seafood and I live in Pittsburgh. I had the Admiral's feast. First the salad, it was drowning in dressing.What I found underneath was spoiled, slimey greens. Unfortunately, this was after I took a bite. I showed the waiter and he was very appaligenic   and replaced my salad.Next, the platter, the bay scallops were no bigger than the tips of my little finger, but tasted good. The fried clams were also good, but no better than from the frozen food section of the supermarket. The fish use to be a white fish, cod or haddock, but now it's tilapia and very small filets. The shrimp was decent sized and all seafood was cooked perfectly. The baked potato was the smallest potato that I have ever had in a restaurant. If they are going to be stingy on the food then they should use smaller plates. The biscuits are the best. I should save myself the bother and just stop and get a dozen of the bisquits. All in all, I wish I had better choices for seafood in Pgh."}
{"text":"shrimp was a bit fishy tasting-alfredo was tasteless---Normally one of my favorite places to eat--service was great--cheddar bay biscuits were great, just disappointed in food."}
{"text":"Great service once we entered all the way until we left. Biscuits were fantastic my salad was just the way I like it. My husbands steak and lobster was the best he had he said he actually had no complaints at all everything was cooked perfectly and taste great."}
{"text":"Host took 5 minutes to get to the desk, there were about 25 people waiting when we arrived. In 10 minutes we waited out of the quoted 35 not one table was sat while we watched tons of people leave. Unacceptable."}
{"text":"We had lunch at this place on X'max Eve, it was such a disappointing lunch given the food was not served 30 minutes after we finished ordering. After calling the manager the food was finally on the table but apparently there is something within this restaurant. The manger was friendly but the waiter at our table was showing us some attitude after manager was called up. So, service-wise, it was such a failure. Food is okay, just like any other red lobster place, but please keep in mind that waiting for 30 minutes is never acceptable."}
{"text":"All Red Lobsters are filthy. Anywho... onto the review.  I've been to Red Lobster a grand total of 4 times in my entire life. Why? Because half of my family has a shellfish allergy so of course my family never came here because we didn't want only half the family to walk out, the other half being wheeled out by paramedics.   I went here tonight for my friend Gracie's husband's birthday dinner. We didn't have to wait long for a table and our waitress was decent. Waters were a little slow on the refills, but I've had waiters literally leave a pitcher of water at the table because I drink a lot of water, fast.   The three of us all got the endless shrimp for $15.99. I ordered mine with absolutely no sides, except a house salad. Skip the biscuits, skip the potatoes, pasta and rice. I think I ordered like... 6 or 7 skewers of the grilled shrimp, 1 parmesan shrimp and 1 coconut shrimp.  More protein, less filler carbs! I'm sure all of that shrimp added up to like 5 oz of meat but whatever - our waitress was still giving us crazy looks when we kept ordering shrimp.   Coconut shrimp was extremely bomb. It was like dessert...but meat...but still dessert. Genius!   I might go back if I'm dying for shrimp because it's a pretty good deal."}
{"text":"I love sitting at the bar I always meet fabulous people. the wait staff is just the bomb. I love the attention and the conversation. this is my I cant decide what eat spot or at least one of them. its always very clean in here and the staff is always very polite."}
{"text":"We ate the ultimate seafood feast last night. The service by Brian was awesome.  Could not have been more attentive but not too much. We had the dish with shrimp, lobster and  crab and it was perfect. Can't believe we ate it all. Even the side dish of mashed sweet potatoes were really good too."}
{"text":"First the restaurant was nice and clean and there was a very long wait.  They pretty much gave us enough time to look at the lobster tank.  It's a bit weird to review a seafood dining place considering how super picky of an eater I am and how much I loathe the taste of fish food, but I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised at the new menu.  First look I couldn't believe that they had boneless buffalo wings.  You better believe I ordered those right away!  With a side of mozzarella sticks and ranch.  The server that served us was actually the manager.  She was super nice and answered any questions the other family members at my table had asked.    Drinks and the delicious bread rolls were brought In a timely manner which is always a plus.  We received our food without incident and we all devoured the food like thanksgiving wasn't the day before.    Thanks to the servers and Riannon the manager for making an experience I was dreading for actually making it a very tasty meal."}
{"text":"Warm salad, out of items, raw food, mushy shrimp and slow service.  not worth it."}
{"text":"This was my very first time at red lobster and I must say I wont be coming back! Our order was wrong our server did not refill our bread or drinks actually never even checked on us! The brocolli was awful...no butter offered for the brocolli or the potatoes or even lemon for the brocolli would have been nice! We are actually still sitting in our booth waiting for our dishes to be cleared and for our dessert! Will never be back here again horrible experience and this was my mothers day dinner! Smdh"}
{"text":"We had lunch here on a Saturday. We were seated immediately. We were greeted by our waitress, Kaylee shortly afterward. The décor was nothing fancy, but had a maritime theme.   After browsing the menu, I decided to get the chef's special blackened New Orleans salmon. It came with a choice of 2 sides. I chose French fries and green beans. The meal also came with your basic house salad. They brought out 3 biscuits to munch on until our orders were up.   The food was out in a reasonable amount of time. The blackened salmon was baked to perfection, drizzled in a butter sauce, and topped with pico de gallo and sautéed shrimp. My order was for a half order which was about 6 ounces. The salmon was warm and flaky and the pico de gallo was cold and crisp. I thought the pico had too much cilantro which overpowered the salmon. There were about 8 nice sized shrimp on top of the salmon. The French fries were the frozen kind.The green beans were steamed until just cooked and coated with butter.  This meal was a mixed bag of good and not so much. The salmon and green beans were prepared well, the garnish and French fries not so much. The salad could have been the tipping point for another star, but it was seriously average. My review for this restaurant is as well seriously average."}
{"text":"Had dinner here this evening and the food was delish as usual. The lobster bisque was smooth and yummy and the shrimp alfredo was cooked perfectly. What I really want to point out though is the service that we recieved here...it was EXCELLENT. Our server, Jasmine, was absolutely fantastic! Not only was she very pleasant and friendly, but she was so on the ball that I asked to speak to her manager before we left so I could tell him about the superior service that she gave us. Jasmine's timing on bringing everything out was great and I should probably mention here that we got the 4 course special, so timing WAS important. When my husband mentioned that he loved the dip that came with his coconut shrimp, Jasmine brought him out extra. We never once had to ask for refills on our drinks because she had a fresh one waiting for us on our table. After our meal, Jasmine brought out containers appropriate for our leftovers and she also brought a bag, which typically at other places we would have to ask for. It was like she was a mind reader and was so on top of taking care of  everything for us! Oh, and she also had to-go sweet teas for us! This young lady was awesome and made our experience here quite nice!"}
{"text":"I thought I had already written a review for this place? No? Ok, here we go....  I worked at Red Lobster in college.  Surprisingly enough, I still don't mind the food.  I very rarely go there, but every once in awhile I get a craving and have to go.  However, as much as everyone loves them, I CAN NOT eat the Cheddar Bay bisquits.  Not because there are anything wrong with them....I just consumed too many of them while running around the restaurant and on my breaks while I worked there.  I will always love the Ultimate Feast. So. Much. Food. Seafood gluttony at it's best.  The crab alfredo is delicious.  I always enjoy when they have the all you can eat shrimp or crab specials as well.  What can I say, I am a fat ass.  I like the set-up of this location.  And it seems to keep pretty busy.  I don't like the parking here.  Although it is located in a Walmart center, the restaurant itself is on the corner of Marks and Sunset and parking is only on 1 side.  Maybe it is just me, but it's not always the most convenient, and getting in and out of the lot can get tricky sometimes.  The staff is always friendly.  I mean, I give it a solid 3 stars.  It's nothing spectacular, but I've also not had the horrible experiences other people seem to talk about. Apparently some people go to typical chain restaurants expecting 5 star service.  I, on the other hand, seem to be easier to please.  :)"}
{"text":"The food is delicious and the service friendly. Kids menu is good but a bit small. Lobster is awesome!"}
{"text":"Service is pathetic.  What's the point of taking a drink order if you never fill it.  Had to ask for my drink three times before I got it.  It arrived after my salad, which was wilted.  Still waiting on dinner.  Got my dinner..Still waiting on my biscuits.  Dinner was good... Service did improve at the end."}
{"text":"They got the order right. Whoever wrote the post about the waiter bringing to your booth asking how your day was it's absolutely correct. And I wish they'd stop. They don't really care about your life, so why fake it? I need to respond to them enough Bakeway. I hate that. And I reposted that the managers going to drop by and ask if your meal is OK, is absolutely right. And I agree, it is equally as annoying. If there were a problem, I would tell the waiter, and if the waiter didn't resolve it, I would ask for the manager. I had earphones in and was minding my own business, and of course when the manager comes to your table they look at you until you take your air Fontana respond to them. That is just so invasive. I told him so. He apologized and was very nice but I wish they would just stop this nonsense. Let me eat in peace ."}
{"text":"About 4 years ago, (has it really been that long?) Kridz and I started going to Red Lobster on Xmas eve. I'm not exactly sure why we started this, but we've done it ever since. Part of the reason has to be that... after about 5pm, it's practically the only restaurant open on N. Prospect.  We pulled up around 630 or so on xmas eve, the parking lot was pretty packed, but we found a spot. Walked in and noticed many people sitting there waiting (again, everyone else was closed). I'm not sure why they were waiting, One was like a party of 6 (sadly, no reservations, not that they appeared to be reservation making people), the other was a party of 2. We go to the host stand and ask if we can just sit at the bar, she asked if we were going to wait for a table, and we are like... nah, we are bar folk. So we sit at the bar.  The draft beer selection is not great. There are so many different versions of the same thing. Budlight, ... other things. I went with a Sam Adams. After finishing, I noticed they have Lagunitas IPA in bottles, so way to sell that Clint! Red Lobster isn't really a place for craft beer drinkers. It's a fancy place... for people who don't know how to be fancy. It's a place for some people to splurge (monthly, semi-annually, annually???).  I ordered the stuffed mushrooms appetizer. I believe they have recently changed/adjusted their menus, as there was really large pieces of (lobster or crab?) (apparently lobster AND crab) in the caps. There was a healthy (or was it unhealthy) amount of butter in the bottom of the dish as well, which is excellent for being sopped up by their biscuits.  Seriously, the biscuits is probably a good enough reason to go to Red Lobster, but you already knew that.  Around here, everyone always raves about Beef House Rolls. Oh, you went to Beef House... how many rolls did you eat? And how was your salad bar? And finally, how was the steak? If you are a restaurant and you are known for something other than the words in the name of your restaurant, you are doing something wrong. Most people who go into Red Lobster will never eat a full lobster. They may do scrimps.. but not the lobster.  When the exwife and I drove back from Alaska, there was no Red Lobster in Alaska, heck, there really was no live lobster in Alaska, so when we were driving back, and finally saw a sign on the side of the road for a Red Lobster, we pulled over to go eat lobster! (she's from Maine). They had a special then, that you could get a lobster tail, to go with your meal (probably still have that) So we each got a lobster... with a second lobster tail. They looked at us funny. We didn't care.  For dinner this time, I went with the Bar Harbor Lobster Bake (or should I say Bah Hahbah Lobstah Bake). (Actually I did say Bah Hahbah Lobstah Bake). Kridz went with scrimps 2 ways, popcorn and like a popcorn coconut.  The Bah Hahbah Lobstah Bake is really good. Extremely large scallops, 3 lobstah tail halves, loads of scrimps, and plenty of mussels. While I'm ok with mussels, I'd prefer clams. Clams seem to have disappeared. Everywhere has mussels. No one has clams. While I appreciate the aesthetics of mussels and their black shells providing a contrast on the plating, I prefer the taste (and memories) of clams.  For sides, Kridz got the Brussels sprouts, I went with the asparagus. The Brussels sprouts were apparently cooked in a browned butter, then sautéed, They were even better with extra butter drizzled on it. The asparagus was very good.  After eating my (and Kridz) veggies, and eating all of the seafood in my Bah Hahbah Lobstah Bake, (and a biscuit, and the stuffed mushrooms) there was really no room for the pasta in garlic and white wine sauce. It was tasty, I just couldn't eat any more.  Everytime I go anywhere, I always run into someone I know. These instances can be expected (of course I will know someone in Champaign), or extremely odd. Like the time I went to a hockey game in Charlotte NC, and ran into the girl who lived in the room next door to mine, from the barracks in Alaska. At basic training, I ran into the guy who was in my brothers grade in school, from Green Bay, who in 5th grade jumped up onto the table and yelled G-FORCE, and said \"I PUT A CURSE ON YOU MRS. PELLETIER!!!\" That's just the way life goes for me. I always place a line on an over/under bet, whenever I leave the house. Red Lobstah was no exception. It was only 1 person though. Robert (I believe it's Robert) from Black Dog. The guy with the really really big afro. He was out with his grandmother and his kids.  Our total for the app, beer, 2 entrees was only 66. We were expecting it to be more, but were pleasantly surprised."}
{"text":"I have been to red lobster many times. Sometimes the food is great but sometimes it's subpar. Currently, the crabfest is going on at re lobster. My husband and I decided to visit and enjoy some crab. We ordered Alaska bairdi crab, stuffed mushroom with seafood and crab cake dinner. Now, I hate sides available at red lobster. They should include an option to add soup as a side or have some better tasting side options. Now, coming back to the food, stuffed mushrooms tasted really nice. They had good stuffing of seafood. Alaska bairdi crab tasted sweet and fresh. Crab cakes tasted really great and I was happy that they had crab lump meat not shredded. We were so happy with our meal that we went again next week. I again ordered crab cake dinner for myself, my husband ordered fresh whole lobster from fresh fish list and sweet chilly shrimp. Sweet chilly shrimps had too much oil in them. I felt as if I'm drinking oil. They did not taste nice. Crab cake was ok as this time crab meat was shredded and was a little bit dry. Lobster was overcooked and was so rubbery that my husband couldn't even cut it with knife. We told our server about the lobster and she immediately called her manager. She offered us to replace it. But our food already had come so late and we were getting late for the movie so we declined the offer. She informed us that she will adjust the bill accordingly. My husband had just taken two bites of pretty expensive lobster. When the bill came, we realized that they took off 50% off from the lobster dish. We still felt bad, as we did not have eaten even 20% of that dish. Anyways, first experience was good but second was a disaster."}
{"text":"We dined here on Mothers Day. I understand it is busy so the 50 min wait was ok. It took the waiter at least 20 mins to even say anything to us. He walked by our table at least 7 times and didn't say anything.  His table server skills was good once he starting serving though. Then the food runner came with our food and placed the food right on the flatware rolled. Not just the tip of it but the entire flat ware. The plate came out hot so my wife had to move the hot plate to obtain her napkin and flatware. The server was right there servicing another table. He noticed it and said he was sorry. The food was average tasting at best but ok.  Lastly, we asked for a box and that never came."}
{"text":"OK restaurant was decent the wait time really sucked they lost our reservation they did however fix it almost immediately. This probably was not the best restaurant but it was decent and a little expensive."}
{"text":"I purposely went to Red Lobster for the first time in my life just to try the Lobster & Waffle! It did not disappoint! I was pleasantly surprised how flavorful the lobster tail meat was with the garlicky sauce drenched in maple syrup over the seasoned waffle which had a wonderful crisp... as if the whole thing was deep-fried. Holy smokes, it was so GOOD!  Something about the blend of flavors reminded me of Chinese style garlic lobster (the best!) Totally worth the twenty bucks! I will definitely be back to Red Lobster for this!"}
{"text":"It was so good I ordered the salmon and the crab legs! Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Good seafood if you avoid the deep fryer portion of the menu.  They have fresh fish specials daily.  The hot buns are irresistible and appetizers are tasty.  Nice bar menu.  I like RL's rock lobster, stuffed tilapia, Chile shrimp, mushrooms, ultimate feasts, crab and Cajun fish dishes.  Salads and soups could be better.  Service is well executed and ambience is fun."}
{"text":"Tasteless in every sense of the word.    Briefly, I thought about leaving it at that but I figured an explanation for the above statement is warranted.    We had a party of 4 plus two toddlers.  Seated immediately on a Saturday around prime time lunch but that's because the place was practically empty and also because of the \"no one\", our food arrived in a reasonable amount of time.    The waitress was cordial at best.  Not friendly.  Also, she hands me my plate and tells me it's \"warm\".  Yeah, not at all warm.  It was uncomfortably hot and I almost dropped it.  But it was only super hot on one side.  Too long under the heat lamp, uh, but just the one side. Not too quick on the drink refills either and we had to be her only table because of the aforementioned \"no one\".   I ordered broiled flounder.  It tasted like a soggy rice cake and it was barely warm.  No taste.  No texture.  The vegetable medley was just ok.  My salad tasted as if it came from one of those pre-mixed salad bags you get at the store.  Granted, it was fresh but it was mainly a bowl of iceburg lettuce, diced unripen tomatoes, one very small slice of purple onion, and diced cucumber.  Uneventful.  All in all, I left feeling hungry and unsatisfied.  Will not be returning to the ol' Red Lobster anytime soon."}
{"text":"I haven't been to a Red Lobster for about ten years so finally made it back with my family who took me out for my birthday dinner.  Was surprised that a chain restaurant like this had so few choices on a huge menu that seemed to repeat the same items as appetizers, lunch, dinner and add ons.  There were tons of upgrades too - you could upgrade just about anything for a few bucks more!  Seems like a place desperate to make money.  Had the coconut shrimp.  The coconut pieces were very hard - not as good as coconut shrimp I've enjoyed in other other places.  My baked potato side was very small and salad was typical iceberg and a few shreds of carrot and purple cabbage.  Never asked if we would like more biscuits.  Our male waiter was pretty snooty - made some sarcastic comments throughout the evening.  Seemed out of line.  If this guy doesn't like people he shouldn't be in a service industry.  We don't typically order drinks and desserts so he didn't look too happy when we didn't order anything but a meal.  My daughter mentioned it was my birthday and he didn't offer a birthday dessert.  Just said to call him when we wanted our check.  Probably skip this place for almost any other restaurant."}
{"text":"The last two times we have been to this location the food and service have been great. I think since the new owners took over the food got better. The shrimp is larger and the lobster I had Saturday was bigger and cooked perfectly."}
{"text":"Setting here very disappointed in my ultimate feast the manager has nickeled and dimed this for everything at this location subpar food okay service we won't be back"}
{"text":"I was very satisfied with this visit to Red Lobster.  Typically, the place is crowded, loud, with slow service and orders that are incorrect.  Today, a Sunday, however, was a great day.  Our part of six were seated promptly and our waitress was on the ball.  Our order arrived correct and hot.  Everything was to our satisfaction.  I suppose any Red Lobster location is a hit or miss.  When it's a hit, all is well."}
{"text":"When we first arrived it was a little busy but we were seated within 5 minutes of arrival  When we were seated our waiter Edwin took our drink orders and after about 10 minutes brought our biscuits and drinks  I ordered Cajun chicken linguini and it was brought out 20 minutes later Chicken was a little salty but not overwhelming linguini was creamy, portions were kinda small.   My favourite thing was that our waiter would refill our biscuits as soon as they were finished, thank god for that because let's be real, more than 80% of the reason we go to Red Lobster is to eat their biscuits!   Overall good experience, and I would recommend the Cajun chicken linguini"}
{"text":"The ultimate feast is the only way to fly I must say that I do love RL. This one in particular is my favorite. We all had our usual on this outing and I ate a variety of sea creatures, same as always. It was great. We did receive particularly excellent service from Ryan. This is not our first experience with him and he was just as willing to make our visit a great one like the ones past. Very cordial and an all around nice guy. We would have had a great dinner either way but Ryan knocked it out of the park so I had to mention him."}
{"text":"I dont know why the reviews are so low at this place, but i love this RED LOBSTER! the only bad thing about it is its too busy all the time. LoL the food always tastes great, staff are friendly and great most of the time."}
{"text":"DO NOT EAT THE SEAFOOD HERE Its not good I ordered some seafood and it was not good I can home sick I laid in bed for a whole day and a half I felt paradises because I ate not good food here"}
{"text":"The food was delicious! All you can eat shrimp really hits the spot! Worth the price for each and every shrimp in my belly. Might i add the biscuits are delicious!!"}
{"text":"The Red Lobster at this location has horrible service. We actually ate at the bar. The bartender Kim had a horrible attitude from the start. We started by ordering some drinks, I had a Hendricks gin with tonic. Which was served in a beer glass, because she claimed there were no more regular glasses to put it in.  We also ordered one of Red Lobster's specialty drinks, which was put in a champagne glass, because she claimed she ran out of glasses for that also. Behind the bar the the glasses were piled to the ceiling, instead of bothering to clean them. But some how she had the right glasses for certain customers, if you can read between the lines. We ordered appetizers that never came out. If I could give the service here  negative stars I would."}
{"text":"So it's been almost 4 years since I've eaten at this restaurant because of my last experiences being so horrible. I swore I would never eat at this restaurant again, but I thought I would give it another chance and I went out with a group of friends and we were having a small party or three-year-old's birthday.  It took him more than 20 minutes to seat us and then another 15 to 20 before they even came to take our drink water. It wasn't just me that had a horrible experience, but everyone's Order at our table was messed up. My own personal nightmare began with a waiter who only had our table and could not get anything right. Some of the items that are on the menu that are very special he kept saying they were out of, only for us to find out a little bit later they have never been out of them. My salad and my supra brought out at exactly the same time, and when I requested them bring my suit back later, they brought me back A bowl of very cold soup. When my entrée arrived, it was not what I ordered. I requested that they bring me back what I ordered, and I was given \"That look\". I finally got my order and it was edible. My sweet potato fluff was freezing cold inside. I almost thought that we were on one of those comity hidden camera shows because my experience was the same with every other person at the table and there were six adults. As I said earlier, we were there for three-year-old's birthday, and they never brought her her dessert or saying happy birthday to her. All in all, I don't care who's birthday it is or how special someone else, I will NEVER step foot in this particular location EVER again!!!"}
{"text":"We don't have a Red Lobster where we live so I always look forward to eating at one. I thought it was really good and the service was great."}
{"text":"I came here with my family for my mom's birthday dinner despite the not so good reviews.   We created our own appetizer, the any three combination one. We chose the crispy calamari and vegetables, mozarella cheesesticks andstuffed mushrooms. The crispy calamari was so delicious and fresh tasting. The stuffed mushrooms were really good too and the melted cheese was good to dip the cheesy bread with! The mozzarella cheesesticks weren't good they tasted like something out of a package.   We also ordered the red lobster signature pizza as an apetizer, it had a crispy tortilla kke crust which was delicious! I just wish they had more lobster on it but the lobster wasn't too fresh tasting.   For main we shared the Fire grilled lobster, shrimp and salmon along with garlic shrimp and rice for a side. The lobster and salmon were delicious and fresh i just wish it had more flavour. The shrimp and rice that came with the main was really good. But i wouldnt order the additional garlic shrimp with rice because the shrimp in the main tasted better and they only gave a teaspoon of rice for it which was disappointing.   Finally for dessert we ordered Brownie a la mode. It was my mom's birthday so i dound it sweet that they brought it with a candle and sang us happy birthday! The dessert was so good, the brownie was warm and the caramel and pecans made it more yummy as the ice cream melted over it! Gabrielle was our server she was really amazing and fast!  We will definetly be coming back!"}
{"text":"This was the first time I had been to a Red Lobster in my life, and from what I have heard, they were like a seafood-centric version of Sizzler. Not in the least.. I must say I had a nice time here from the beginning to end. The server was courteous and prompt, the appetizer bread was surprisingly good, and the entrees were very tasty. I had the Surf and Turf, expecting the steak to be sub-par. I love steak, and this was excellent steak. Perfectly cooked and coupled with Lobster tails (2). I don't really dig on seafood, so this is a place I won't be frequenting, but I highly recommend and would gladly come back. I actually \"sent my regards to the chef\", like a dork..."}
{"text":"To my surprise.  This place was line up out the door at 8pm.  Host told us table for two would be 50-55 minute wait.  We figured we would wait instead of going to another location. The wait ended up being only 30 minutes.   I ordered the seafood feast with lobster. Crab legs. And two types of shrimp. For 33 dollars. And a fish taco with fries.  They give very little fries. But I guess it was just enough.  After eating all the food. It just hit the spot.   It was what you would expect. Boiled seafood dipped in butter.  Maybe it's just me. But I much prefer the Asian way of making lobster."}
{"text":"We had a combo dish and a trout dish. The trout dish was adequately cooked and lightly flavored, it was ok though not particularly memorable. In the combo, there were breaded shrimp and unbreaded shrimp with a pesto-based sauce. These were pretty good. The lobster was cooked well enough, but not expertly, and was pretty much a standard lobster. And the crab was again ok, cooked well enough, not remarkable. So, 3 out of 5 stars. It's adequate for a safe, unremarkable seafood dinner."}
{"text":"Great late lunch service & food from Maria at the Decatur location. As we always enjoy the seafood here we still want to try something different . Great suggestion from our patient waitress to try the mussels with garlic sauce over Alfredo .  Would love to come again and ask for Maria. *****"}
{"text":"1.5 stars   I don't think I will come back to this Red Lobster location after my latest experience here. We came in on a Wednesday night to take advanage of the endless shirmp deal which ended on November 8th. We had called in to be placed on the waitlist, a 20 minute wait, not bad. By the time we drove there, our 20 minutes but the hostess told us it would take another 10-15 minutes for a table to be ready...this is why we called in, I don't want to wait.   We were finally seated 10 minutes after walking in. Unfortunately, this didn't matter as not one server acknowledged my presence for almost 20 minutes. I was pretty upset but I didn't want to get up and leave since we drove all the way from Uptown for this. Finally, our server arrived to take our drink order. I asked her if they still offered the endless shrimp deal which sent her off into this huge schpeel about how endless shrimp festival is the worst time of the year for the servers, how much they hate it, and how they're boss was throwing a party for them when its over. Everyone has their right to an opinion on any matter including this but I think it's common sense not to share these opinions with your customers. I felt extremely uncomfortable after this conversation and hesitated to say that my bf and I specifically came here for the endless shrimp deal.   It took another 30 minutes for our orders to come out, in that time, she checked up with the table behind us about 4 times but did not come to our table once and my water was completely out. My boyfriend was furious as he felt we were unable to fully take advantage of the endless shrimp deal due to the degree of neglect from our server. I was very disappointed when the food actually came out. My garlic shirmp scampi was dry as a desert in hell and my pinapple coconut shrimp was clearly thrown together. As the restaurant got less crowded, the quality of the food improved. I was just over it at this point.   Save your money, patience, and time, go to another Red Lobster location. The one in Pineville is much better and the High Point location is outstanding, go there for sure. Ask for Amy if you are dining in High Point, she's rad."}
{"text":"The best part of the restaurant is that they are not so busy. Good for family with little kids. It's big enough that kids can walk around because it is so empty at prime dinner time in the weekend. The biscuits are great. The food were below average. Do not order the mash potatoes on the site, they are more saltier than the seafood."}
{"text":"We generally sit at the bar for lunch or dinner. Bartender Nate always gives great service! Love the lobsterita it comes with a side car, yummy! Who doesn't like the chedder bay biscuits!!! Great place near the mall!"}
{"text":"Update: On our last visit  we met a bartender called Derek.   Service was much better than the first couple go rounds and everything truly came out on time.  He mixes one hell of a great Lobsterita!  What a difference one good person can make eh?"}
{"text":"Delicious food. Great service. Went for a work birthday (mine) and the server and service was excellent. The shrimp linguine Alfredo was amazing, the biscuits are ALWAYS great. The best part was the surprise birthday ice cream complete with birthday candle. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to pop in red lobster and I was glad we did. Our server Mike M was amazing. We sat in the bar area, which was nice and quiet and romantic. I never had to ask Mike once for anything. He was on top of it. It's hard to find great customer service nowadays. We definitely will be back. Food was amazing also"}
{"text":"I had a craving for crab so we came here.  First,  the service was excellent.  It felt like I was at an upscale restaurant.   Those cheddar biscuits were served warm and were to die for.  The Alaskan king crab legs were delicious,  and I wanted to order more!  Also had the tomato caprese side and it was really good.  The hubs ordered the seafood trio and it was so much food!  He really liked the fried shrimp.     I've always been hesitant about going here, but I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"I didn't eat here, but when I called to make a reservation they told me they didn't take reservations - which is fine, I didn't know - and proceeded to hang up on me. They couldn't wait for me to ask how crowded it was or anything like that. Unacceptable service and I immediately changed my plans."}
{"text":"I came to Red Lobster for their Four Course Seafood Feast! For $18, you get a soup, salad, entrée, dessert, and best of all- unlimited cheddar bay biscuits! Yum! There was so much variety and food for such a good price. I personally don't love red lobster's quality of food, but those buttery biscuits really tug at my heartstrings. I just can't stop eating them!  You can choose between New England clam chowder and their soup of the day. We went with the chowder, and it was pretty hearty. There were a lot of potato chunks and vegetable, so I didn't feel like I was just eating cream. I wouldn't expect a really refined clam chowder from red lobster, so this more than met my expectations.   Then, you get your choice of fresh Caesar or Garden salad. My boyfriend got the Caesar, and I got a garden salad. Again, nothing too special, but it's nice to have some veggies with the meal. I also liked the large variety of salad dressings available to go with my garden salad (I went with Thousand Island, my favourite).  There are 7 choices for the entrée, unfortunately none of them involve lobster. Our choice was the hand-breaded shrimps, which came out a little too greasy for my liking. I also did not enjoy the pairing with the cocktail sauce at all.   My boyfriend went with the \"create your own feast\" option, and chose peppercorn-grilled sirloin and island jumbo coconut shrimp: hand-dipped in coconut batter, then fried to a golden brown. The coconut shrimp was served with a piña colada sauce. The steak was pretty mediocre to me, but my boyfriend was satisfied. To my surprise, I really enjoyed the coconut shrimp! I could actually taste the coconut bits in the batter, and its subtle sweetness was wonderful with the crunchy texture. It wasn't any less greasy than the hand-breaded shrimp, but in this case, I didn't mind it at all. The piña colada dipping sauce was also a great complement to the coconut flavours.   Our dessert from the four course feast was triple-chocolate brownie à la mode. It was unbearably sweet for me. I had one bite and that was more than enough. Luckily, the portion was quite small, so my boyfriend had no difficulty finishing it by himself.  We had a lot of leftovers to pack home. I barely touched the hand-breaded shrimp and packed most of it to go. I would certainly come back for the jumbo coconut shrimp, since that is one of the 7 options for the entrée. Even though not everything was fantastic, this $18 four course seafood feast undoubtedly has great value!"}
{"text":"The cheddar bisquits are always good, and our waitress was also very good.   This was a family outing that included our adult daughter and her boyfriend.   I had ordered a \"do it yourself\" lunch, which means you could pick a couple of entrees for your lunch plate.   I chose fried shrimp and fried fish.   The shrimp were prepared well, if a bit small, but the fish--which was pollock--had a dark and unappetizing colour beneath the breading, which suggested that the fish wasn't as fresh as it should have been.   The baked potato was good, but was also rather dwarfish.   You can get some good meals at Red Lobster, but I wouldn't ever order the pollock again."}
{"text":"We got there at 730 on a Thursday night.  We waited 45 minutes. We ordered the calamari and whoever thought it was a good idea to include fried broccoli and peppers was wrong, too many flavors that mask the very delicate flavor of the calamari, in short ruined it. We ordered fish and chips and a chicken dish. The fish was greasy and breading had no seasoning. The fries were warm..ish.. crispy and could tell they were not fresh. The chicken dish was actually cooked nicely, the wild rice was probably the best thing on the plate. Considering the prices they charge I expected so much more especially in such a foodie city. They were busy so obviously people come here but sorely disappointed is an understatement. I will say the staff was attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"This Red Lobster is amazing! The restaurant was very clean and we I had exceptional service. Stuart takes the cake on servers. He definitely sets a high standard and is  huge asset to this restaurant. The food was very hot very fresh and was delivered quickly. I will go back here every time I am in town. Not just for the food but the OUTSTANDING service!"}
{"text":"Don`t....just don't.  Eat at one of the many other chain or unique restaurants locate near by. I would describe the flavor of the crab linguine and flounder my wife and I endured as being similar to the lean cuisine microwave dinners I had as a latchkey kid.  1 star for the cheeder bay buscuit because I not a monster."}
{"text":"Based on customer service alone. Our server Jordan was awesome. She was super sweet and has a very nice personality. This was the first time our Red Lobster server suggested we upgrade our drinks to Mega for a dollar more. Who knew? Lol   We're new to Henderson and most of the restaurants and general stores that we've been to don't have that out of the box customer service we are use to, so thanks for your great service."}
{"text":"coconut shrimp is the best here for me.  With the delicious pina colada dipping. Comes with a side and salad. delicious baked biscuits"}
{"text":"I have been to decent red lobster restaurants in the country. But seriously what a joke I was recently hospitalized and when they told me I could have normal food I thought you know what let's get some takeout seafood pasta. OK spaghetti with salad shrimp. Salad shrimp. Are you kidding me cuppa noodles is better than this crap $40 wasted."}
{"text":"Have no complaints about our lunch. Arrived at 12:45. Hostess was nice. Waitress came right away and was very attentive. We shared orders of talapia and shrimp tacos. Very good. Our water glasses were kept full. Clean."}
{"text":"Food is good, as always, Red Lobster is one of my favorite restaurants (it has always been). The two stars go to the service: we were a party of five on Friday night (not really busy night) and we hardly got checked on. Our waitress was nice, but we had to repeat our requests twice, like more silverware for everyone, drinks, etc. (thumb down). When she brought biscuits (after 20 minutes we were seated) there were only 4 of them instead of 5. When we asked her if she could bring more, she answered she's only allowed to bring 4 per basket. Now I don't want to mess with Red Lobster policy (again, it's one of my favorite places), but this answer sounds very silly to me! If you know your party has 5 people, at least bring 2 baskets!!! Right? Everyone got a lobster entrée, which includes a salad, so everyone got a Caesar salad first. What I didn't like was that our entrées came before we were all done with the salads. I personally felt rushed. I'm in the same industry and I know it's up to the waiter/waitress to properly manage the timing between salads and main courses. Whatever. Maybe the lady was new and it was just a one bad case. But for a quiet Friday night, I would have expected more attention. Will I go back? Of course, I love Red Lobster! But please, for the very well trained team you have, more attention must be paid!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend's favorite restaurant is Red Lobster.    (Can I get some sympathy?)  Since this location is near my mom, and near where we used to live, I've been there a lot.  Yea, I like their biscuits.  And the food isn't particularly bad or anything.  But DANG it's gotten expensive for what you're getting.  And the lines at this particular location can be insane!  We've had an hour's wait before.  An HOUR wait.  For Red Lobster!  Sigh....   I will say that we had a good experience not too long ago.  We went to the bar, as the wait was long.  We found out that we could order directly at the bar.  The bartender was our best server in a long time at that location.  And of course, we never had to wait long for a drink refill.  If you're thinking about going I suggest you sit in the bar.    This will never be a place I suggest between the long waits and value for what you are and aren't getting.  But... she loves the Ultimate Feast and nothing will ever change that.  So I'm sure we'll end up going again...."}
{"text":"I've been to this location multiple times and the service has always been wonderful! My previous visit about two weeks ago was AMAZING! Our waiter greeted us with the happiest attitude and brought out our appetizers and drinks in a quick and timely manner. I went with my boyfriend to celebrate our 2 year anniversary together since he has never been to Red Lobster before (which he now loves) and we ordered the Endless Shrimp which tasted delicious (we absolutely love shrimp) and it came with a side salad to start as well which we also enjoyed. We went during dinner time around 6:30pm so it was a tad busy but the service was still great!   Overall the food was good, the choices for the Endless Shrimp kept us satisfied with a different choice for each round and our waiter made sure we enjoyed everything while maintaining every other table he had as well. We will definitely be going back! Can Endless Shrimp be an all year thing?"}
{"text":"Took my wife for a special dinner. I was very disappointed. The baked potatoes were not at all fresh and skins were tough as a boot. I had asparagus that was so tough I could hardly cut it with a serrated knife let alone chew it. Samon should be firm and flakey but instead it was mushy. For a place that specializes in sea food, they do a poor job of preparation for the prices they charge. Will not eat there again."}
{"text":"Been here a few times over the years. I came here with a friend not too long ago. The food is not too bad here for being a seafood chain restaurant it is always pretty consistent and the quality is usually the same. When walking in the door till you leave everyone is always friendly and makes your visit enjoyable. The cheddar bay biscuits are always good when they first come out hot. Its hard not to eat them they are so good! I think when someone says something about Red Lobster this is the first thing you think about. Unless they have a special I think their prices can be a bit high, I love seafood and I think your limited to what seafood they offer here, Example full belly fried Oysters, or full belly clams fried. That would be awesome to find here, and some things are seasonal. I really like when they have the all you can eat shrimp special.  Over all Its not a bad place to go if you like prepared seafood dishes at a chain restaurant..   We had a great dinner , no problems. Would def come back sometime!"}
{"text":"The food was great, but the service was horrible.   This was our second time there and compared to our firs visit, this was completely opposite. The waitress seemed as if we were a hassle and at one point I felt like i should apologize for coming to eat there. Is it really that big of an issue to get me some ketchup or some extra napkins.   The menu was amazing for all seafood lovers, but I would definitely think twice before recommending it to a friend."}
{"text":"Eating here was one of the worst experiences I have ever had at a restaurant.  The initial wait for a table was about 45 minutes when we were told 15 to 20, and things only got worse.  While being seated my coworker sat down into a pile of ice, to have the hostess respond, \"That's free of charge\" and walk off.  The sad thing is that was the best service we got all night.  The waitress failed to get us drinks in the first 20 minutes.  After ordering we were bought biscuits but they failed to be warm, as was the case with all of the food.  The when the food arrived my dish was cold, and my coworkers dish was wrong.  What they brought him wasn't even on the menu.  When he asked the waitress responded that it was what he ordered, rudely.  My other coworker asked how we had ordered something that wasn't even on the menu.  She then agreed to fix it.  At the end of the meal, she brought three separate checks as requested but she charged me for the dish to fix my coworkers problem.  Then to get this fixed took an additional 20 minutes.  To say the least, not only will I never eat at this restaurant again I may never go back to any Red Lobster again."}
{"text":"Red Lobster's one of my favorite seafood places believe it or not some general franchise company. I went to eat last night with a couple of Associates from work. The food was the portions I don't know what happened over the last few months but the horses have gotten smaller . I ordered the shrimp scampi with a side of lobster tail in the lobster tails look like they came off a quarter pound Lobster laughing out loud. I gave it 3 stars because I'll come back again I just think it was a fluke. I love their cheese breads of course."}
{"text":"Three words: Chedder Bay Biscuits.   \"You can put a color with any noun and make a restaurant,\" my youngest brother commented on the ride over. He sat in the very back of the Envoy. I was behind the driver, my father. It was a family affair - the first dinner together since my other brother had gotten in from leave.   \"Green French fry,\" the oldest of the two sons said. Ew.   I understand that Red Lobster is a direct insult to anyone living on the coast - whether you're from Seattle or Boston. Trust me, I'm well aware how offensive this restaurant can be. Yet, consider the demographic of the diners - all of us from Kansas. Sure, I've been to the coast, eaten fresh fish in Boston and San Francisco. Red Lobster is not what I would consider \"upscale dining.\" Yet, considering the alternatives, I was okay with the selection. After all, they had to have a decent beer, right? They did. I ordered a Blue Moon while my brothers chose mixed drinks.   Our waiter, one gregarious Erock, was the life of the party... and he wasn't even family. I ordered his recommendation - the Cajun Salmon - and found myself barely picking at it. I had a few bites of broccoli, but mainly I was content munching on the biscuits and drinking my beer. My brother picked at his steak. I tried a bite. \"Chew, chew, chew,\" he said as my teeth tried to tear the beef apart. \"Bite 15 and you've lost all flavor.\" I nodded sympathetically. Most of my family enjoyed their meal, though I could tell there were a couple disappointed in parts of their entrees, like the rice. I boxed mine up to go, for my Dad had ordered the exact same thing and loved it. No reason in wasting food, you know? Besides, I like making sure mi padre is well fed.   We all left full. I think my meal consisted of 75% beer, 15% biscuits and 10% \"real\" food."}
{"text":"Red lobster is a place you go to once in a while it's nice that they have the endless shrimp the atmosphere is clean and they're always busy at this location the only downside about red lobster is it being in Phoenix and since we're not close to the ocean the portions are smaller than what could really be I can only imagine how I'm Maine lobster looks compared to a lobster here overall this is a great place good family food we enjoy it"}
{"text":"About what you'd expect from this chain. A nice lunch date affordable and never busy except during lent."}
{"text":"Haven't been to Red Lobster in ages, so i thought i would give it a try again, especially with the lobster - steak combo that's on the menu.  There are so many entrees to choose from, which is awesome.  But i knew what i wanted. The service was lovely with the waiter being attentive.  And also there was no line up to get seated, which was amazing for a down town restaurant on a Friday night. The food came in a decent time.  The portion was nice.  I was really excited.  The steak was not bad.  I asked for a medium, and it was slightly to the medium-well side.  The lobster was a biy salty.  The asparagus was also a bit over cooked.  So i was a bit disappointed overall with the quality of cooking.  Maybe they were just having a bit of an off night.  I can see it being a great tasty dish.  Maybe next time."}
{"text":"I don't where to start with this. I wish there was more of these in L.A. The Ultimate Feast, is the best. I love the cheesy biscuits. The food was always on point and it just was the best seafood I've had in awhile. Not to mention it was always so fresh! - I was never able to get a picture of my food before devouring it but it was good, and for the amount of food you get the Ultimate Feast's price was well worth it!"}
{"text":"Whatever you do DON'T I repeat DON'T eat the lobster linguini disgusting taste like salt butter unless you like that flavor. They always over cook the lobster the shell becomes more like a sponge rather then the nice hard crackable shell. We went with a party of 10 only one of us liked their food. I gave 2 stars because the hot yummy biscuits they give for free is actually good. If you end up there you're better off eating free bread and ordering drinks recommend the mud slide!"}
{"text":"This is the spot I always hit up for Holidays and or special occasions. I get my craving for RL, satisfy it then I am good for awhile. I am a shrimp slut, I just can't get enough. This last visit was during the AYCE shrimp promotion. I got my fill of shrimp scampi, traditional fried. sweet chili shrimp, teriyaki shrimp skewer and shrimp linguini.   As I write this review, I reminisce on that shrimp feast and feel that I need to get satisfied again!    Service is always good, the RL staff Rocks!"}
{"text":"OK so Red Lobster is classic as I have been eating at this establishment since I was a kid since the 80's. This is the spot for celebrations of birthdays and such for us, maybe two or three times a year.  This last visit was a treat for my birthday and my first time at this location. I usually visit the location on Decatur as it is closer to home.  Anyhow, I am boring, I always order the same dinner, the seaside trio which is shrimp linguini, fried shrimp and shrimp scampi.  I am a shrimp eater, what can I say? Mmmmm all of that buttery scampi juice going wild in my mouth, it was truly welcome and delectable.   The service was great, the food was delicious as always and pretty much what we always expect. Although I had to work off the calorie intake from this meal with three sessions, it was well worth the splurge.  If you have eaten at RL before than you know what it is all about, if not than check it out."}
{"text":"First time ever being their, it wasn't busy at all maybe 5 tables with people. I got seated very fast, took waitress 15 minutes before finally asking what we wanted to drink, then another 10 minutes to get us or drinks. After ordering we waited about 15 minutes to get our food and it was cold! And I had to ask her 3 times for napkins before she finally gave us some. I'm not one to complain about service but his was the worst!!! Don't think I'll be going back"}
{"text":"The crab is delicious.  I had bought some gift certificates from another chain that was among a conglomerate of restaurants and Red Lobster was one of the valid restaurants so I used the certificates here.  I got a crab combination meal and an additional 1 lb of crab legs. Yum.  Crab Crab Crab!"}
{"text":"Food was great. Service at a table was fine in a previous visit. But in the bar, it didn't seem like a priority for wait staff to take orders and tend to customers dining in the bar area. Ended up taking longer than it took for many others to get seated and waited on in the restaurant dining area. So the deduction in stars is sure to that lack of service level in the bar area."}
{"text":"I should have trusted my gut. I mean, he's the one who has to suffer for my poor choices, so really, I should have trusted him.  He knew better. My gut told me, \"Dan, remember that time we went to Red Lobster when we lived in California?\" \"Yeah.\" \"And how bad it was?\" \"Yeah.\"  \"And how you vowed you would never set foot in another Red Lobster again?\" \"Yeah but this is different now, gut. We live in Canada! That's a whole other ballgame!\" \"Sigh.\"  No, my gut was right. Red Lobster is crap. Not crap altogether ... they have SOME redeeming qualities! First of all, the \"shipwrecked\" decor is charming. Something very homey and comfortable about it. And the biscuits (as I remembered correctly) are great. Soft, salty, flaky ... they are really, really good.  Aaaaaaand the compliments stop about there. All the food is low-quality, poorly prepared and all around ... just pretty gross. I won't go into too many details except to say do NOT get the crab cakes. They are disgustingly tepid, flaccid little lumps of crappy crab meat. I thought I was actually going to be sick from these things.  I also don't understand how people talk about how \"cheap\" or \"affordable\" Red Lobster is. I could easily find a MUCH better meal in this city for a similar or lower price. I would take Joey's over Red Lobster any day.  And even if it is on the \"cheaper\" side of most seafood places, I would much rather pay a little more and get something that is actually good quality.  Sorry Red Lobster, I'm sticking with my gut from now on. The only way I'll be back is if I somehow fall into an alternate universe."}
{"text":"Hey, Red Lobster Marketing Staff:  I've got an idea.  I'd like to propose trying a popular---okay, maybe trendy, but a proven successful concept---that will likely increase your sales ten-fold, maybe more.  Wait...wait !   Don't be so smug and prideful.  You \"sea food differently\", right?  So see diners differently, too.  Step out of the confines of that corporate take-out box for ideas---you're not the only ones with them.  Before scrolling to the next review, read me out.  Thanks.  You can start by testing just a few cities, say, like---Chi Town, the Big Easy, the Big Apple, San Francisco, and---of course---last but not least---Cleveland.   The city I'd like to call the Big Friendly---a city and its burbs, who have a number of restaurants serving up maybe some of the greatest food in the nation.  Heck, just use US.  With our mostly discriminating palates, you'll quickly learn if this idea is a go.  Still with me, execs?   Ready for minimal investment, with maximium return?                                    FOOD TRUCKS  No!  Wait!  Hold on!---don't stop reading!  Before thinking crazy thoughts about tooling up and down city streets with splashing tanks of sloshing, water-immersed live lobsters, hear me out.  It's simple.  Offer just one item.      Those scrumptious 5 Star CHEDDAR BISCUITS  YUM--EEE.  Winners, Winners, forget serving dinners.  ~ ~ ~   Okay...back to reality.  Too extreme.  Likelihood of it happening?  Zero.  When we want those golden pods of goodness (they DO look like little spiny oysters, aptly fitting for a seafood restie), crispy on the outside, slightly oily-salty, moist & cheesy on the inside---we'll just have to drive to one of their establishments to pick up these legendary treasures for take-out.  Done.  Until maybe10 years ago, this was our place for CAESAR SALADS, CHEDDAR BISCUITS, and LOBSTER.  And I couldn't visit without re-acquainting myself each time with their irresistible Golden Cadillac.  (An old-fashioned ice-creamy alcoholic libation/dessert combo that was a bit risky to drink while perched on a bar stool rather than sitting safely in a booth.)   Those were the days.  Don't know what happened.  After a visit about 5 years ago---then again, yesterday---Red Lobster is just not the same anymore.  Not even remotely close---EXCEPT for the fresh, cool, seasoned-and-dressed-just-right Caesar Salad, and those beckoning, can't-eat-just-one, biscuits.  (Tried the cole slaw for the first time.  Actually, pretty decent.)  Didn't order a drink this visit---wanted to focus solely on the food.  Other than those three menu items---and our friendly, likeable, efficient, well-tipped server, Pam---nothing was particularly good.  From an okay 3 stars---\"Lobster-Topped Maine Lobster\"---served with mediocre, not creamy-rich, but chicken-brothy-tasting mashed potatoes and no-flavor-at-all green beans (never had absolutely tasteless veggies until these), w/cole slaw for 25.99, to a 1/2 Star ---\"Create your own\"---Lightly Breaded Clam Strips and Crunch-Fried Fish, w/fries & salad for 10.29.  Nearly flavorless clams had reached the firm, snappy, industrial-strength rubber-band stage, and the two pieces of disguised-with-thick-breading, bland and almost no-taste fish were insulting.  Minus coating, only 1/4\" thick !---yes, I measured the one I took home for poochy... even McD's is 10X tastier and heftier.  In fish total, probably smaller than a deck of cards.  Copious breading on the fish?---possibly close to two decks.     With almost everything being so...uhh...blah and skimpy, how does one approach a manager?  And who wants MORE of something not that good?  Instinctively, too, I knew that whatever would be replaced would be exactly the same.  It's not like anything was especially bad-tasting, or spoiled, or that necessary ingredients had been forgotten.  Based on our disappointing visit 5 years ago---and now this one---I believe the seafood results are what's being typically served.  Customers must like it, though.  Every time I happen to drive by, their parking lot is full or close to it.   Jumping ship and heading to another restaurant  ...aulgh... was not on my agenda.  After nearly 4 hours of yardwork and gardening, then a refreshing zesty lemon-scented shower, I arrived hungry and ready to relax.  I didn't feel like moving anything but my arms, hands, and mouth, so I resolutely relished every single bite of my salad and biscuits, but ate very little else.     Excluding tip and a glass of 8.99 Chardonnay, the total for two luncheon meals was about $36.  When I think of what I could have purchased raw for even $25 at 7 Seas Seafood---okay, not that much...maybe a small bag's worth---I can't help feeling a bit miffed.            ~   If we ever return it would be only for the 5 Star Caesar Salad and their 5 Star Cheddar Biscuits.  We've taken our last SEAFOOD cruise on the S.S. Red Lobster---it was neither a Bon Voyage nor a Bon Value.     ."}
{"text":"It was just ok. We haven't been to a Red Lobster since we moved here from back east.  Hubby wanted the cheedar biscuits and we were in the area which is why we decided to drop in.... again it wasn't bad but I don't think we'll be back"}
{"text":"I visited here for multiple times and tried different combinations. White wine and roasted garlic mussels  langoustine and lobster pizza  Endless shrimps option  Four courses option  Ultimate feast  Wood-grilled lobster, shrimp and salmon  Surf and turf combination  Bar harbor lobster bake  Endless cheddar biscuits and different options of sides  The food is good and service is good. Almost love every seafood option here. One thing could improve is that sometimes the lobster is a little small comparing to the price! Haha. Or maybe could consider to lower down the price a little!    If the price could be a little cheaper it is better. Haha"}
{"text":"I really liked my server, he's been nice. The French fries are pretty good but they need more salt. The ketchup tastes kind of weird. The sunset strawberry smoothie is awesome. The chicken fingers are good. You don't even need any sauce. I like how the place looks. The flags are pretty, but it is really dark. But it's a nice place for your family dinner."}
{"text":"Ahhh red lobster. I have been coming to this location since I was a kid.   I always try to get here as early as I can when I know we will be having an event here. The parking lot fills up QUICK and who likes waiting inside for a table?   The food here, I will admit, is hit and miss, but for me personally, it has never been horrible or non-edible. Again, easily been coming here for 10+ years. Sometimes it's great, hot and fresh. Sometimes it's a little greasy, Luke warm and just \"okay\". One thing that's always perfect though are their biscuits. My god, I could eat them everyday.   Service is just like any other chain restaurant. Sometimes you get someone great, sometimes you get someone just okay. I've never had a problem with any of the staff, even when I've had the odd problem, it was always remedied quickly and effectively. Great customer service, always.   All in all, this restaurant has its roots. Been in the area a long, long time. Several other locations have closed over the years, but this specific location has stood the test of time. That should say something!"}
{"text":"2 star only because their food is a miss for me. the only thing i liked in their menu is their lobster tacos. other than that, their clam chowder is a disappointment."}
{"text":"if you like buttery seafood and want to seal the deal this place does trick. If the girl loves the Mandingo take her here. She will be impressed by the 70-100 for two dinner they will serve you. Large, diabetes inducing frozen drinks paired with artery clogging fried Seafood will set the mood. Ordered some tilapia, a few vegetables, along with a glass of Red Wine(gotta make sure the cox works afterward) meanwhile my date ordered a daiquiri the size of a japanese fighting fish bowl along with some fried slop. Waiter here was extra friendly, food came out on time and i had this animal naked in my hotel room(literally across the street, why else would I come here) playing the meat flute minutes after paying the bill here.  Did the job for me, hope it does for you."}
{"text":"Since Beyonce reminded me about Red Lobster last year, I've often considered coming here again. It was another meh experience, but man, I love those biscuits and the size of their drinks.   What do they do to their seafood and/or butter to make you feel so awful afterwards. MSG? It's gotta be the G."}
{"text":"Came here with my wife and her grandmother!!! That I been fortunate  to know for over 20 years dinner was great!!!!"}
{"text":"Came here for a work lunch with our crew. We had ordered our food in advance as we are on the clock and on a deadline. Upon arriving the host told us that ordering in advance is impossible. And left us to seat ourselves. He never went to check with the kitchen to see if our order had in fact been received. The manager came over and was surly with our colleague who had placed the order. When people are saying they have an out the box or unorthodox order perhaps take the time to listen to them and to help instead of simply repeating \"We've never done this before\".  My lobster rolls were dry. But, the waitstaff was amazing. In short - management needs some interpersonal classes or one of the fab waitstaff can step up to the plate!"}
{"text":"This place is my go to for family dining! The servers are all so pleasant and accommodating. My three children are very picky eaters and the servers are always very patient. The food has never disappointed and we leave very satisfied every time without fail!"}
{"text":"So inconsistent! Tonight, Sunday, king crab legs arrived over cooked, mushy. They replaced, 2 nd batch a little better. Server was average, at end of meal, brought me a fresh drink to replace my club soda, I'm on a no sugar diet, took a big drink of Sprite. For $75 plus tip, we expect better."}
{"text":"Crabfest goin on.  Been sittin on a gift card.  Ordered the Jumbo Lump Crab Cakes (2) and Salmon for $24.95.  NASTY.  Server was ok, but wanted to do all the talking and not listen.  He talked so fast you thought the place was packed.  It was lunch on Tuesday and the place was dead.    The so-called Jumbo Lump Crab Cakes were the size of a silver dollar and one inch thick.  They were super mushy, no \"lumps\" of crab anywhere, frozen crap like you by in the freezer section at your local Walmart.  The texture of the crab cakes were just the my mashed potatoes.  STAY AWAY FROM THE JUMBO LUMP CRAB CAKES"}
{"text":"Food was great, but the staff was awful. It was a very cold atmosphere. I went in for take out and I won't go back to that one."}
{"text":"Yesterday my friend held his birthday dinner at Red Lobster. We were all excited to celebrate his birthday here by eating yummy seafood...BUT! Red Lobster messed up his reservations. Initially he booked for 7 pm and got a call back saying that they don't take reservations past a certain time on Saturdays. When we got to the restaurant we found out that they had triple booked three parties for the exact same time, which was 5:30 pm. We had to wait over an hour for a table and by this point we were getting quite frustrated.  Dinner went smoothly and everyone was happy with their meals. The only thing that I didn't like too much about the lobster was that it was quite salty and petite. We pretty much got anorexic lobsters lol."}
{"text":"I used to LOVE Red Lobster but I'm not impressed by the food or service anymore. What Red Lobster does Beyonce take her man to? I've given this restaurant several chances (in numerous locations) to change my feelings about it but nope. I'll always love the crabs, the biscuits, and lil lobsters in the tank when you walk in but the food is blah these days. The night I went here, my broccoli was over-cooked & my waiter seemed pretty clueless when I asked if my food was supposed to be cooked differently. (it was, according to the menu) After eating here, my bf & I made the decision to eat at chain restaurants a lot less frequently."}
{"text":"food was great but the service i received was not so great. which made me just lose my appetite all together!! our server was really really rude. had an attitude and got orders wrong. slammed our plates on the table. almost spilled one of the drinks because of this stinky ass attitude he had!!!! i was really irate. i would like to go to my favorite restaurant (which might not be my fave anymore because of this experience) and enjoy myself! because of this man's attitude i gave him a $3 tip (should have gave him nothing at all) the server got mad about the $3 tip and came up to us as we left with an attitude again being sarcastic saying \"i hope that didnt break your pocketttssss\" waving his hand as he said \"pockettttsss\" ..............ungrateful ass!!!!!!!!!!!!  im done with this red lobster i rather drive an extra 10 miles to another location"}
{"text":"I come here alot and i love the food and service here.  They have great lobster, fish and other seafood.  I like the prices a service."}
{"text":"Best experience I've had a RL in a longtime. Service was on point and our meals we satisfying and tasty. For the first time in a LONG time I have no complaints from big RED. good work guys, I'll give ya another try sometime. Cheers to lobsterfest and knowing the difference between Maine and Rock lobster, really a step up in my experience."}
{"text":"Dined at red lobster today Everything went great the food was delicious good job keep up the good work"}
{"text":"It took over 45 minutes for them to to seat us. We ordered the calamari As our appetizer and when it arrived it was substandard and did not taste very good. When our entrées arrived they were cooked however the seasoning was lacking and the food itself tasted like something I could make it home. The staff was relatively attentive however for the price and the wait time was far below my expectations. I was reminded why I had not been to a red lobster in three years and won't be returning anytime soon."}
{"text":"I've been here many times and have always enjoyed it. Went yesterday to celebrate a birthday and I will say they did great with accommodating our party, our waiter and waitress were both awesome but the food was horrible! It came soggy and cold with hot plates.. Idk if it had been sitting or what. Because it was such a large group none of us wanted to make waves because we really did have great service but seriously my husband and my kid both were sick all night. Majority of our party left their food behind. It was so disappointing! I gave a couple stars because they did try hard to keep our drinks filled and had to add tables to our large party.. Staff was nice but the food  I doubt I'll ever go back."}
{"text":"Went here to celebrate my big 3-0. Our server I think was named Michelle.  She was excellent. I went big.  I got the Bahama mama (my fav! ) as always it tasted delicious.  No other restaurant makes them as tasty. For dinner I ordered the ultimate feast. The food was beyond delicious.  The timing of the orders was perfect.  All in all it was one of the best meals I've had in the last year."}
{"text":"This past Friday my family decided to throw a surprise dinner for my moms 70th bday. we got their at 5pm to reserve our table for 20. In which we were told why did not make a reservation in a rude way. We let them know that we called a head and were told no we do not make reservations on the weekends and to arrive a hour early.  it took 2 hours before they could even seat us. so we got seated and then my mom walk in through the front doors and the hostess told yeah their all over ready to surprise you.  REALLY its surprise birthday and you tell her that we are all hiding over their.  thanks hostess for ruining the surprise birthday.  This is a very poorly ran business with no communication. ZERO Customer service. I wish we chose a different place to go eat, one wear the employees actual make you feel like they want you in their establishment."}
{"text":"Top notch service, well prepared food, and great, clean atmosphere Our server, who we'll just refer to as \"t\" did a fantastic job."}
{"text":"Well, its hard for me to admit but I was wrong about this one. I was in the mood for Seafood Saturday night and just wasn't happy with Kings fish house last visit. Someone mentioned Red Lobster and my first thought was that it was a mediocre chain restaurant.   We called to see how busy it was and they said less than 10 minutes. When we arrived there was plenty of parking and it looked pretty nice on the inside, only a few people ahead of us. Sure enough we were seated in about 10 minutes.   Our waiter arrived and took our drink orders. At first glance the prices do seem pretty high but if you keep looking there are plenty of reasonably priced options. I went with the jumbo lump crab topped salmon. We were of course served the cheddar biscuits and a nice salad (all included) before the dinner came.  The dinner arrived piping hot and was a generous portion. It was served with rice and green beans. The fish was really good, cooked perfectly and had a wonderful lobster sauce with plenty of crab on top. We got out of there for under $50 for two dinners and drinks which I thought was a pretty good deal.   My only negative comment would be that the cheddar biscuits were quite salty and some menu items were pretty high priced ($25-30). Other than that I was pleasantly surprised and would definitely return."}
{"text":"Service is typically great.  But this time I sat at the bar and that bartenders/servers in the bar area seemed distracted. Like hella distracted. Like we had to ask for things twice and try to get their attention. When I am sitting at a table, that almost never happens. I'll probably go back to sitting at the table and leave the bar alone.   Otherwise, this is the only place I trust to eat seafood (judge me! IDGAF!) around here. I also get the crab legs and it never fails me. NEVER.  Although this time my corn was burnt (took one bite and left it alone).   If you are looking for good seafood, go here. Seriously."}
{"text":"Consistently a good experience.  Not a fancy place by any means but a great neighborhood restaurant with friendly staff and good food."}
{"text":"I like this restaurant but not this visit. I ordered my family and I meals online and it told me to pick up the food at a certain time. I got there a few mins before the arrival time but I still had some time to wait. But that wasn't the issue, once I got the food home it was cold like the food had been sitting. I ordered the waffle and lobster special it was such a disappointment my waffle was over cooked burnt and hard and my lobster tails was chewy. I also ordered 2 orders of the the 1.5 lbs of crab legs with sides which was missing the baked potato's. That I didn't realize until I got home and a kids meal lobster with fries. The entire meal was a complete disappointment and I feel like I wasted a 100 bucks. If I had time to take the food back I would because it was trash."}
{"text":"this is not a happy story... came here with a bunch of friends for a birthday party recently. parking was an absolute nightmare for this place(Saturday evening) to the point where I had to illegally park my car, turn off the car, and hang out for about 20 minutes until a legit spot was available, still early for the reservation thankfully. the party arrives and we enter the restaurant only to find that we had to wait for our table/seating, 30 minutes later, we end up finally sitting down, with the offer that some of the apps would be free for the whole table. ended up having two servers for the evening, which was ok, between the both of them they made minimal mistakes, which was fine. ordered some seafood and we were on the way. the apps came and everything was good, hot and tasted ok. we got our main courses, but we only got the main courses in sections, two people got their food first, two minutes later, six people got their food, two minutes later a couple more got it, at this point leaving one person behind for an additional five minutes(11 minutes from the first plate arriving for those keeping tabs) we all started to eat our food when all of a sudden one of our friends discovered that a shard of glass was mixed in with the rice. we called the manager over who kept very calm and professional over the whole situation. comped the meal for the gentleman, and gave a gift card. I was impressed with how he handled the situation, but not impressed with the situation all together. our friend who experienced this was bleeding from the mouth, and couldn't finish the rest of his meal, resulting in him not eating for a couple days afterwords. the food was delicious, hot and flavorful. but because of this incident I will never be coming back.  we shouldn't be paying a premium for seafood and sides only to have this company not thoroughly go through the food that they serve, doesn't show respect for the people keeping the business open.  the waiters were the only redeeming factor of the whole situation.   never coming back."}
{"text":"We decided to give this place another try over a month later..wasn't too impressed the second time around, the staff was somewhat friendly but everything and everyone just felt dead. There were 3 waiters looking after 7-8 tables in the main dining area, it took them 50 minutes (Yes I timed it) from the time we sat down to get our entrees. We didn't hold up the process and were ready when the waiter came around, there was just no hustle on their part. We were also only a table of 2 and a party of 4 who sat down probably 10min after us got their entrees first. The timing here is just horribly off. On top of that this was the first time I've tried lobster, you'd think with Lobster in their name that it would be good or at least decent. The lobster was heavily seasoned that you tasted more of that than anything, when you did get to some clean lobster it peeled off with a bounce like rubber and it curled and tasted like rubber as well. I was shocked at how expensive it was for the quality that came out and the time it took. No thanks and our stomachs weren't feeling too great afterwards. Save your time, money and appetite for somewhere else. Bleh!"}
{"text":"For a while, my husband and I kept seeing the endless shrimp commercials on TV every night. We have never been to a Red Lobster before, so we decided to come here for dinner on a Friday night. What a mistake that was because it was ridiculously crowded! I think we waited about an hour for a table.   We both ordered the endless shrimp and it was surprisingly good! You get to choose 2 dishes at a time, and it comes with a salad. The choices are Teriyaki, Parmesan, Garlic, Hand Breaded, and the Linguini Alfredo. My mistake was ordering the Alfredo during the first round. It made me full and I didn't order more after that. :( But it was so darn good! The pasta sauce was very tasty. I also ordered the garlic shrimp, which came out hot and full of garlic buttery goodness! The Cheddar Bay Biscuits were also addicting. We had to stop ourselves from eating more than one to make sure we had room for our dinner. I also love their Sunset Passion Colada (virgin because I don't drink alcohol)! We ordered the Warm Chocolate Chip Lava Cookie for dessert, but it was disappointing because the cookie was kind of cold.   Service started off good. Our server was friendly and attentive in the beginning. Later on, he stopped refilling our drinks and it took him forever to bring us our bill. I think it was a very busy night and the servers were overworked. I thought it was nice that we were able to take our leftovers home. Normally restaurants that offer an all you can eat deal will tell you to eat it or leave it.   The second time we came here, it was much better. I believe it was a Thursday night and it was pretty empty. We sat in the bar area, but service was kind of the same thing we experienced the first time. Attentive at first, nonexistent towards the end. The food was still great, and I was able to try the Teriyaki and Parmesan shrimp that time.   This place is not close to my home, but I would definitely come back. Just not on the weekends."}
{"text":"I've only eaten here 3 times. It's always a good and fun experience. They serve delightful meals, I'm a seafood lover so this place fits me. Everything that I've tried in here are fantastic! Some people may have unhappy  comments about this restaurant, but well,you have to go there and see for yourself..I mean every experience are different, not because somebody was disappointed and was not satisfied doesn't mean were gonna have similar experience.  Their store is clean. i like the idea that they have live seafoods, amazingly fresh ready to be cooked the way you want it! Fresh seafoods taste a lot better! Yum!!! Their food service is great. The waiter is very cheerful and attentive to our needs., which is very essential in your restaurant experience. It's like one of the keys to make a customer either happy or not other than the food."}
{"text":"I haven't been to a Red Lobster in years I went with a party of 4 the service was great and the prices were very reasonable but the menu was lacking big time. They don't offer as many choices as in the past and the meal was mediocre at best. I remember the menu having many more choices years ago."}
{"text":"This was my very first visit to Red Lobster. My waiter Devin V, was very informative and attentive. Thanks to Devin's suggestions, I ordered: 1 Seaside Shrimp Trio, with a side order of Carrot+Butternut Squash. This combo of seafood was soooo good and very filling. I topped off the meal with a Boston IceTea Mango flavored that Devin suggested. The restaurant's interior was very attractive and was in a great location, not far from Metro Center Mall. I look forward to returning and trying something else."}
{"text":"I had the worst meal of my life here. It was way over salted, horrible quality food badly cooked. What were we thinking? A seafood restaurant serving seafood well ? The shrimp was rubber, the lobster over cooked and old with absolutely no taste. The salad was cheap iceberg with fake shreds of cheese and little else other than bad dressing. The pasta with shrimp was over cooked and tasted like wall paste. THERE WAS NOT ONE GOOD BITE! Oh oops...I lied. The cheddar biscuits saturated in cheap cooking oil had decent greasy taste. To ad insult to injury, the manager was nasty and argued with our complaint, ridiculing our opinions. All this for almost $100.00 for two people( only one drink). Horrible. Don't throw your money down the toilet. I will never ever...."}
{"text":"I used to live in a corporate condo right across the street and visit Red Lobster at least twice a month. Not because it's that great a place, but it was exactly for the three stars: \"A-OK\".  Seafood is precisely ok. Sometimes a bit better than that, frequently a bit worse than expected. Portions are huge, really huge. Crabs are so-so, lobsters are good, rest is somewhere in the middle. Sauces are cheap, kraft-style. And yes, obviously there are those biscuits - sickeningly unhealthy, and of widely variable quality. May I suggest not to try their cocktails - those are really bad. Like zuko with alcohol and some sugar on top.  Service is professional and reasonably fast, they all smile and sort of engage in a friendly conversation, but that's fake - try to talk to the same server just a week later, he won't even remember you. Surprise! :-)  Overall I would categorize Red Lobster as a place where I don't hesitate to go, but won't suggest it myself. Nothing personal (pun intended)."}
{"text":"I'd only really been to Red Lobster as a kid when celebrating something. For Christmas, I received a gift certificate so felt they had to be used.  I otherwise would never go as an adult.   It just has this cheezy, busy, family vibe that I'm not interested in for a dinner out.  We finally went so we could use up the gift cards.   The place was teeming with small children but we got a pretty private booth.    Service was spectacular, that is one thing this place has going for it, our server was thoughtful, attentive, and although the place was super busy, she never made us seem like it.   When our appetizers were taking too long she brought our salads before hand.  Food was alright, our crab legs were IMO overcooked and dry which made them difficult to eat.  The sides were delicious though.   Overall, we had a nice night out.  Would we ever go back?  No.   But with a gift card we had to use up it was a decent dinner."}
{"text":"Yeah...so for some reason, I'm writing about Red Lobster.  I mean I guess I did eat there yesterday but it really almost seems like a waste of effort.  A while ago (like 20 years) I liked Red Lobster a lot.  Use to go to the one in Torrance Cali by Del Amo mall pretty regularly and it was halfway decent.  But somewhere along the way it kind of went off the rails.  Prior to last night the last 2 times I ate at a Red Lobster was in Bismarck and Grand Forks ND...at that's about 7 years ago.  After those experiences I swore the place off.  So back to last night.  It was Lobsterfest time so we ordered two lobster based meals.  Not bad.  The melted \"butter\" stuff was waaayyyy salty.  But other than that things weren't bad.  The service...nice guy but waaaaaaayyyyyyy tooooooooo slooooooooowwwwww.  Asking for tabsco sauce after the meal came took waaaaaaaaaayyyyyyyyyy tooooooooo loooooooonnnnnnnggggggg.  Getting a refill on a soda took waaaaaaayyyyyyy tooooooo loooooooonnnnnnngggggg.  With a bottle of wine, a $10 off coupon and tip, bill came to $100 for two.  Whaaaaaatttttttt!!!!!?????  For not much more money I can get a far better seafood meal, at a far nicer restaurant (a few places in the Scottsdale Quarter come to mind).  It might be another 7 years before I return."}
{"text":"I used to go to Red Lobster in Florida all the time and decided to give it a try here in Las Vegas! It was so good! I got a shrimp Caesar salad as an appetizer. My shrimp was so crunchy!!! And the size was huge. Then as a main dish I got a big sampler of fried shrimp, shrimp Alfredo and baked shrimp. It was excellent and so big that you can share it with your partner. And of course the famous Red Lobster bread! It's a legend. The service was very fast and friendly. And the prices are fair. Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"The food here at this Red Lobster was pretty delicious. For starter we had the ceaser salad, clam chowder soup and the mushroom meatballs. Entree was the New York Strip,  Red Lobster Tail, baked potato . And the second entree was the Lobster Tail, Salmon, shrimp with pilaf rice. Finish it off with a strawberry cheesecake . The strawberry cheesecake was superb! Its warm and moist with the right sweetness.   It also comes with unlimited soft butter biscuits. The texture and crispness was on point .  Food was very delicious. 5/5 for every dish from start to finish .   Service was fantastic. Didn't have to ask once for refill. Came by numerous times asking how the food was.   All said and done. Would definitely come again ."}
{"text":"Service was pretty good. Biscuits are my favorite! Crab legs are amazing."}
{"text":"I certainly made a mistake by going to this resturant the other night. Shame on me! Should've known better. First let me say our service was absolutely fine . The waitress was very nice. Now the food. Bring your own. I ordered 6 oysters on the half shell as an appetizer and a lobster/shrimp combo. What I got was no oysters and tge lobster and shrimp were served chilled as a cocktail on shaved ice. It should have been served as a hot dish with rice and vegetables. How on earth they came chilled I have no idea. Maybe the waitress wrote it up incorrectly. The lobster tail must have come from a juvenile lobster because it was skinny and no more 2 inches long. The shrimp, only 4 were under sized although the menu said jumbo. This \"dish\" cost $17. What a rip.   My son had the admiral platter which was fried, clams, scallops, shrimp and flounder. The shrimp was passable as we're the tiny bay scallops and clams. The flounder was over cooked and like rubber and still frozen inside. My wife had a salad and clam chowder, likely canned or frozen in a bag. Mediocre at best.   I've been to a Red Lobster in Provo, Utah because my son wanted to go. We took a chance this place would be passable. We were very wrong."}
{"text":"Erik was the greatest server we ever had! The whole staff here is very friendly and the food is amazing! Wish we had the money to come here more often though."}
{"text":"Best service ever the food is amazing the drinks are amazing this is a really great restaurant about to feast on crab feast trio of snow crab king crab and crab fettuccine a seafood fans dream."}
{"text":"I'm still giving it 3 stars for the following reasons: 1) when drinks were served my friends ordered coffee....no spoons 2.) When I asked for refill....didn't come 3.) The food I ordered, lobster pasta...very greasy 4.) 4 people 160 + bucks no alcohol...I think it's a bit much 5.) Due to being very busy the service wasn't as great.  Will only go there for special occasions. It's really greasy and small portion."}
{"text":"Biscuits are fabulous. The new caprese salad is amazing, so fresh and flavorful. Loved it. The food is always great. I always struggle with the service here, typically wait staff isn't that friendly and things are often slow. Food makes it worthwhile but I always hope this will be the time service is better. Dessert is always good and they make a fabulous Caesar. I keep coming back and you should come if you love good seafood. Just prepare for a wait and prepare for staff that often seem like they want to be anywhere but here"}
{"text":"As we all know good, fresh seafood is hard to get in the desert. We decided to give Lobster Fest a try.  Only had to wait about 5 minutes on a early Saturday night. Jayson was our waiter and he was fantastic. We split a appetizer and an entree.  Langostino, artichoke seafood dip and the special crispy fried lobster with cheddar bay biscuit waffle. The dip was good with large pieces of shrimp and lobster, chips fresh. The waffle was interesting, didn't taste like their signature biscuits and the jury is still out on the waffle. The star was the fried lobster. Excellent tasting batter covering the flash fried sweet lobster tail. Dipped in that syrup...pure heaven.  For our meal, plus a kids mac and cheese and 3 non-alcoholic drinks our bill was $47 and change."}
{"text":"unfortunately we went in on a tuesday evening an it was endless shrimp but our waitress sydney made everything great!!! thank you !!!"}
{"text":"Where we live there are no Red Lobster restaurants so we gave it a try. Went at one of the busiest times on a Friday night when a lot of the mature and kids go to dine.   Wait was decent, about 20 minutes, and were seated quickly. The service was okay and could have been better. She didn't introduce herself and didn't bring water. Didn't know or see anything that said water served on request.   My friend spilled the clarified butter and asked for napkins to wipe it up and our server never even offered to bring more. The little bowl the butter was in was on the edge of the plate and if you moved any of the food, the chances were high that it would fall off.   The food was pretty good for being frozen lobster and all. They had the live ones and next time I will probably go that route for better tasting lobster."}
{"text":"This seafood restaurant was really crowded when we tried to come with our family on a Saturday night. The food is expensive, and depending on what you order, is usually fresh. Although I find the platter that my husband ordered with more fried items was definitely not as fresh. My pasta with basa fillet had a very flavourful sauce, although the fish was a bit on the dry side. The highlight for me remains the biscuits that are always incredibly buttery and tasty with the herbs. Those are my most favorite items on the menu and they do give you quite an unlimited supply of them. The lobster that my relative had was very fresh though, but a bit on the smaller side, if I compare that with ones I've had at other restaurants."}
{"text":"It was my first time here and I ordered the salmon with shrimp scampi and it was delish! The salmon cooked just right not too juicy as I likes it and the shrimp in that sauce was soooo good! I'm looking forward to more visits so I can update this further."}
{"text":"Well, I hate to give this place 2 stars because I haven't been to Red Lobster in a while and like to give businesses the benefit of doubt... in most cases. However, the ball was just dropped two many times for me ignore (honest Yelper here).   I tried the Concord location but there was an hour wait, since it was Saturday my friend and I were up for the mini journey to enjoy our dinner at the Carolina Mall location (our hearts were set on Red Lobster, can you tell? Lol). We arrived and were told it was about a 40 minute wait but could be shorter since it was just two of us. We were seated in about 30 minutes, so all was good there. Once we were seated... that's where things went sour...  Charles (our waiter and the sole reason this place received two stars from me instead of one) arrived at our table after about 10 minutes and was ready to take our orders and my drink order. (Disclaimer: Charles was under a lot of pressure and did his best to handle the issues, so kudos to him!) For starters, I was unable to eat my Caesar Salad due to it being drenched in dressing, after we got our waters... my drink didn't get made by the bar until 25 minutes after the order was put in... only to arrive without ANY alcohol (no, seriously) so it was a straight smoothie...oh, but it didn't end there.   After receiving my order of peppercorn sirloin, I cut into the steak only to have blood pour out over the plate and onto my mashed potatoes. Yuck! No way, I'm eating that... I understand Medium-rare but this was just rare. My waiter gladly took the plate back to them remake my steak. I cut the entire steak in half, which in any other restaurant would lead them to remake my order completely.... Nope! I got my exact two crispy pieces back without any thought on presentation (see the pic). Charles clearly saw that I wasn't pleased so I got a free dessert... but that went my friend, because at that point I was just ready to go.   Needless to say, I will not revisit this location again. Thanks but no thanks. I will just take my loss on Red Lobster and eat elsewhere if the Concord location has a long wait."}
{"text":"I love red lobster and I always go there on special occasions. I am obsessed with seafood and they have an amazing variety."}
{"text":"Holy crap, man, this place is horrible. We went back after like 20 years of not going here, and we were sure disappointed.   First, and this may have been my fault, but the calimari had all these weird, pungent vegetables with it that ruined it.  The service would have made Hertz proud -- it sucked.  And the rest of the meal was just, small, mushy, salty seafood.  Gross!"}
{"text":"Service: excellent customer service. Our waitress was very attention.   Food: I ordered an appetizer with 2 items of my choice (Mozarilla sticks and something else). The sticks were too burnt up. I tried two of them and didn't end up finishing the rest. For main entree, I ordered 1 1/2 lbs of Queen crab legs. It was very meaty and juicy. I also ordered a Oreo cookie milk shake and if was just OK. It was a bit water down. I probably will not order that again.   Rating: I still give it a 3 stars. The crab legs were tasty and the service was good. However, the appetizer does need a lot of work."}
{"text":"As I am not usually a a fan of seafood however I do have a love for fish but I came here for two reasons: To celebrate Father's Day (my father is a die hard seafood lover) and to try Four Course Seafood Feast Special ($17.99).  We seated in a large comfy booth in the dining room across from a large window that viewed onto the street out front. The place looks likes its been renovated as everything looks fresher and brighter and more roomier from the last time i've been here. Our waiter, Joseph was really pleasant and gave us recommendations on what appetizers to choose.  For appetizers we ordered  Red Lobster Signature Pizza - A crisp thin-crust pizza topped with Maritime lobster meat, melted cheese, fresh tomatoes and sweet basil.  This crust is really thin, sort has the texture of a crispy tortilla but it held up well against the ample toppings. We all really enjoyed this pizza especially the ample chunks of the sweet lobster.  Next onto the 4 course special which comes with a soup, salad, a choice of one of seven mains, and a dessert plus of course there unlimited Signature Biscuits.  I have to say one of the highlights of Red Lobster is there signature Cheddar Bay Biscuits. They never disappoint! Crunchy garlic butter brushed exterior with fluffy warm interior its highly addictive and can been deadly as they are unlimited! I appreciate that our waiter Joseph always kept our basket full bringing them straight from the oven.  Next came the soup course. I went with there new Spicy Chicken Tortilla Soup. Subtle heat but very flavourful, similar in taste to chili, with white beans, chunks of chicken, diced tomatoes, topped with crispy tortilla strips and shredded cheddar cheese it was very enjoyable.  3rd Course was the salad. I opted for the Garden salad with Balsamic Vinaigrette. The salad was pretty lack luster just topped with a slice of cucumber, tomato and red onion and some croutons beneath chopped romaine. I didn't care to finish it.  For my main I chose the Fresh Grilled Tilapia. Very lightly seasoned cooked perfectly with a spritz of lemon, it definitely was fresh. It came with a simple serving of steamed broccoli and rice which were both average nothing fancy.  Finally for Dessert I went with the Triple-Chocolate Brownie á la Mode. Came out warm dotted with chocolate chips and fudgey centre with a scoop of french vanilla ice cream drizzled chocolate and caramel sauce. I enjoyed every last bite of it!  Overall a decent meal, great and attentive service and everyone left stuffed and satisfied. Those unlimited Cheddar Bay Biscuits are enough to keep me coming! back!"}
{"text":"Fruit Fly Hell My family and I have gone here for years and never really a problem with anything but our last visit was kind of a mess across the board.  Me and a couple in our party sat at the bar before we got our table and ordered drinks.  The bartender had us wait longer than we should have even after acknowledging us and asking if we were waiting for a table, she even served another customer that sat a few mins after we did before us.  When she finally took our order she forgot it, came back and asked what we ordered again and proceeded to bring a wrong drink out of the three we ordered.  While sitting at the bar we noticed a little fly and didn't think much of it, they happen. As we chatted there more flies appeared and became a nuisance.    We then were moved to our table a good distance away from the bar and were still bothered by the little flies.  They ended up in a water, a salad, and just constantly in our faces. The only saving grace was our server, he was great! Please take care of the fruit flies!"}
{"text":"My family and I always come to Red Lobster if we don't feel like picking anything else. It's not too far from our house plus we receive great service at this location.  We always get a bag of the biscuits to take home with us and the food is pretty good. I always get the shrimp or lobster Alfredo when I go there. I really should go outside the box, but every time I do I just switch right back to my comfort zone.   The workers are very polite and friendly. The place is clean, and the drinks are good (expensive but good). We will continue to come here for many more visits ;-)"}
{"text":"My husband and I went to this location for dinner on Saturday nice. We were seated in the back near the bar. Our servers was awesome we had 2 gentlemen who were also working at the bar. My husband ordered the steak with shrimp skewer, and I ordered endless shrimp(pasta & Nashville hot shrimp)Our food came out in a timely manner and we began to eat. I liked the shrimp linguine, but the Nashville hot shrimp were not good at all. The seasoning wasn't distributed evenly and there was barely any honey on them I tried one and decided I wasn't going to eat them. My husband was very disappointed in his food as well. He ordered his steak medium and it was super tough on one side(well done) and medium well on the other side. And the shrimp on the skewers he said tasted like chemicals. We let our server know and he was super cool about it and ended up taking it off the bill. Red lobster use to be one of our favorite places, but the quality of there food has gone down for sure. This was our first time at the Gilbert location, and we would go back only because the service we received."}
{"text":"Food was good but the service was horrible. Our waitress was too distracted with other customers that she forgot our order. We didn't feel welcome at this restaurant so we won't return again."}
{"text":"My mother and I went to enjoy dinner at 5:30 on Wednesday night. We were seated quickly. The dining room is entirely too dark to read the menu and the table was extremely small. We had, a brisket basket, a glass of wine, a glass of sweet tea, two salads, a cup of soup, a appetizer of mussels, an Ultimate Feast, and a pick three entrée. These all barely fit on the table and we had to keep moving things around. Our server, Emily, was fantastic! She took the time to help my mom read the menu without her feeling like an idiot for not being able to see it. She knew the menu very well, was able make recommendations for my mother and helped create a fantastic meal for her. Emily kept my tea filled, the biskets filled, and checked on us regularly. The food was typical Dardin fare, corporate recipes made in corporate ways but the price was decent for the food received."}
{"text":"Thought I would try again... walked into an extremely cold (a/c blasting on a cold rainy day) environment. Went to the bar, was not acknowledged. Went to the hostess, asked for a table for one. She got on the microphone. Report to me was, \"we are turning tables\", it would be about 5 minutes. She handed me a flashy thing. I looked around and saw many open tables in both the bar and the restaurant. I walked out. Lack of attention to detail."}
{"text":"Red Lobster, to me, is just a glorified fast food restaurant that serves seafood. That doesn't mean it's bad, it's just not my first pick for seafood, considering their prices....That said, why did I come here? The usual reason you go anywhere low on your \"worth my time\" list, everyone else in your group wants to go.    We came in because our friends wanted to do the 4 course meal deal for 15 bucks. That is a good deal, I have to say, but if you are someone like me who has dairy allergies and can't choose anything off the deal menu (everything is laden with cream or butter....), then it's not worth your time.....  For me, I ordered the salmon and shrimp with a maple-something glaze.....the positive: my salmon was not overdone. The negative: since I have to specify no butter or cream on anything, they were real good about making sure the fish was dairy free (yes, that is a positve too) the funny thing is, they served the maple glaze on the side \"just in case\"....huh? so, I asked, does the glaze have butter in it or something? \"no, but we put it on the side, just in case\" yeah. I still don't get it.......   Another annoying thing was the fact that my plate came with mashed potatos (note to my dairy-free peeps: restaurants like this DO NOT have dairy free mashed potatos....everything is pre-made, we're not special enough for the cook to go make our very own mashed potatos....) AND with the rice pilaf.....which, having visited here before, I'm pretty sure is not dairy free. (I asked about the rice....usally they give me a different option, like steamed veggies or something, but our server just seemed a little frazzled, and didn't quite understand what I was asking.......)  Not to mention..... my food came out a good 15 minutes later then the rest of the people at my table. :/ not cool. It was a busy night...but, come on....I KNOW fish doesn't Take THAT long to cook......."}
{"text":"Got there before others and they went before us.  When it came time 10 minutes later only booth available.  Then told we had to wait 15 more minutes!!  Place was empty !  Won't be coming back !!"}
{"text":"I will never return. I placed a phone order a few minutes after 8pm before driving out of the Douglas airport parking lot. I headed straight for Concord, and when I got there decided to run into Walmart for a few items. By the time I arrived at the restaurant, it was almost 8:40pm. I sat at the bar and was told to wait a few minutes. I did not get my food until after 9:30pm. The bartender kept apologizing and offered me a drink for my wait. I declined, I was just so miffed about waiting all that time. Ridiculous!   I have a feeling they did not make my order until I got to the restaurant to pick it up! If I was told this I would've left after telling them forget it. I will never return to this Red a Lobster again. After getting my full of those delicious biscuits (which is what lured me there in the first place) I won't be back to any of them ever again!  Okay, I will, but just to get some cheddar biscuits."}
{"text":"Went here for a family dinner with my in-laws. It's been around ever since I was in high school from what I remember. The place is actually pretty big and has a casual ambience.   We were seated right away and it didn't take much longer for our waitress to come by and ask what we were having to drink. I actually went with the watermelon lemonade per suggestion of the waitress. It came in a tall glass and it was actually pretty good.   For dinner I chose the shrimp linguine Alfredo. I also choose to get it in a half order. I didn't know you could get half orders so it worked out perfect for me. The linguine was a bit too salty for me. Also, my mother in law complained of her food also being way too salty. She was not even able to finish half of her meal. I love their biscuits and our waitress even gave us a bag to go."}
