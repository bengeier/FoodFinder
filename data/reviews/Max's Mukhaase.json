{"text":"I've had the fried fish and just had a chicken dish, and they were both great. Its wonderful food that's very approachable. Definitely recommended."}
{"text":"Max ' s is a real authentic African restaurant. The food is mouth watering delicious. I had one of the Chef's favorite Tuo zaafi. The food was well garnish with excellent taste. Be prepared to use your hands and will probably be licking them when done. Customer for life."}
{"text":"Never felt as at home as I did at this place. Max was an absolute joy who took his time to explain everything and was more than willing to customize everything to our liking. Very flavorful I had the fried tilapia with red sauce and veges and my friend had the jollof rice with plantain and curry goat. Absolutely loved the food and the vibe - Max you just made a customer for life!"}
{"text":"This place is definitely a spot to hit if you're looking for something different! We've been wanting to try it out for a while and it didn't disappoint. I got Palm wine which was very tasty and refreshing (note it serves more than one.) Then for dinner I had the Tilapia with Banku and was surprised at the huge serving I received. The tilapia was very well seasoned and though the banku was filling it was very tasty. I can't wait to go back and try the Fufu next! Max was a great host and talked to everyone who was there. He always had a big smile on his face and you could tell this was his passion. Loved the music too!"}
{"text":"Good and Fresh African food. Place very clean and Employees are very nice and friendly. This restaurant has such rich, marvelous culture. This place have done a great job at cooking the goat meat to its perfection. He made it vegetarian for me, too. It's fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"\"Medaase\" !  The most friendly, hospitable, and delectable African restaurant in the Phoenix area. MAX's MUKHAASE (Kitchen) was the best experience of authentic African cuisine I have experienced in the Valley.  You won't be disappointed (nor sick). Located off Alma School Rd and Guadalupe Rd, in Mesa. SouthWest Corner of Intersection.  My favorite dish is Zucchini stuffed with Max's Rice, Carrots, Cauliflower in an unforgettable, yet smooth peanut sauce. Everyone else in my party enjoyed the Tender Beef, Chicken and rice dishes.  Each dish has a different style of rice! The portions are generous and establishment is clean. Not a single crumb in the seats or table.  Max and his restaurant family place love into their presentation of food.   Max is very professional and answered all questions I had with professionalism and kindness. I learned alot about my Ghanaian family and culture in my conversations with Max, as well as the through the food and art.   There are 2 flat screen tv's for your enjoyment as you wait for your fresh cooked food.  One tv hosted American channels, while the other Ghanaian channels.    PLEASE NOTE:  Food is made to order. Very Fresh. Therefore, If you only have a 30 minute lunch break, do not expect the food to be made in 5 minutes.  Just a Heads up! Possibly call ahead of time?  \"Medaase\" (thank you) for a wonderful experience,  one of which your whole family would enjoy."}
{"text":"I had the peanut soup with the rice balls and goat meat. Everything was so fresh and delicious (unlike most American food), the soup was exceptionally seasoned, the goat was nice and juicy and tender. When I arrived, DJ Moe was playing some good ol classic music that reminded me of home and many times I was tempted to get up and start dancing! The suya was soft and juicy as well. The food was amazing, the service was amazing, and the atmosphere was amazing. Overall 10/10 experience, would definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"I am not accustom to African cuisine. This food really opened my eyes to new flavors. The staff was very friendly. Thank you"}
{"text":"Fufu Goat Soup for me!  I've never had any local food from African countries and it was delicious.  Mom-food if your Mom is from Ghana, I would say.  Max was friendly and helpful, and didn't make me feel like an under-educated white diner. Soup was a bit spicy but not killer, broth was incredibly good.  Down the street from me so I'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"My spouse and I always like to try someplace new on our anniversary (22 years today) so we picked Max's Mukaase. And, boy, are we glad we did! Fantastic food and wonderful conversation with the owner, Max. It's traditional Ghana cuisine. I had the peanut soup with lamb and rice balls, my spouse had the goat soup. We kept eating each other's meals because both were so tasty! They have a catfish pepper soup that'll be on my radar when I go back."}
{"text":"If you are in the mood for different, try it! We brought a group of 5 and shared 1)peanut butter soup with rice balls (awesome) 2)tilapia with banku (it's supposed to be smelly, but soooo tasty when mixed!) 3)goat soup with fufu (amazing!) 4) jollof rice (this was the biggest hit with everyone). Each dish was unique and portions were big.  We started with the meat pies: they were just ok, next time we'll pass. The staff is very friendly and attentive. For the beginning of our meal the tv was a little loud but eventually got turned down."}
{"text":"If you want to move beyond normal ethnic food this is s great move. Local place where the owner obviously cares. Serving west African food mostly from Ghana I think.  I had goat stew with black eyed peas and rice and a very flavorful sauce. Very tasty. I will be back to try another dish. Love supporting local place working hard to make a go if it"}
{"text":"Eating at Max's tonight was a delight.  The moment we walked in we got a warm, genuine greeting from Maybel.   We were not too familiar with African cuisines, so we took her recommendation to order the peanut butter soup with rice balls and the beef jollof.     Both were delicious, especially the soup.  It was rich and creamy in the way one might find in a nut based curry.  The beef jollof was crispy with a spiced tomato sauce, and even better with the house made chili sauce drizzled on top. The prices were quite low, especially when one considers the very large portions.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"My fianc√© ordered to go banku and okro stew. Very delicious but the meat portion and the stew was not enough. Will definitely come back but please increase the stew amount. Thank!!"}
{"text":"The peanut butter soup is my favorite. He made it vegetarian for me, too. It's fresh and delicious. Reminds me of my grandmother's cooking - minus all the meat and hooves she puts in hers"}
{"text":"I was on a business trip in Mesa, AZ and decided to give this place a shot. Absolutely the best decision I made during my 4 night stay. The food was very well seasoned and cooked, I ordered from there twice during my stay.   First night I ordered Fufu and goat light soup plus another order of kenkey and fried fish. I love African food so much that I had to order two entrees the first night. The second night I went back and ordered Fufu and goat light soup. I loved the food and went back for more during my short stay in Mesa. I will return again in August ^_^"}
{"text":"I've never been to an African restaurant before and this was a wonderful introduction for me!  I ordered the Fufu and Goat Light Soup and a meat pie on the side.  The soup was amazing!  So full of flavor with just the right amount of spice!  And while most of the goat I've had was served in the form of a curry, I've never had goat this good.  It was so tender and flavorful.  It worked so well with the flavors of the soup broth.    Now, just an FYI: my enjoyment of food is based almost more on textures than flavors.  And fufu has a texture unlike anything I've ever eaten and it was difficult for my brain to say \"yeah, that's food!\".  Nonetheless, it is a wonder vehicle for the soup and once I was able to tell my brain to just shut up and enjoy the food, I was in heaven!  The meat pie was basically a fried pastry with a filling of meat and onions.  It was delicious and very large for the price!  I probably could have had a scoop of rice (or a mug of that broth!) and it would have made a wonderful meal on its own!  All in all it was a wonderful experience.  I will order from here again for sure!"}
{"text":"This restaurant was on my bookmark list and I finally had the chance to try it today while I was waiting for my car to be repaired. I ordered the beef Ala maxo based on Max's recommendation (I don't eat fish). I wasn't sure what to expect as I have never had cuisine from Ghana. The strips of beef green pepper, and carrots were in a hearty, savory gravy with white rice on the side and it was delicious. Everyone there was extremely friendly, chatting with me occasionally while I ate. I overheard the staff talking to a customer about ginger beer, which I love (and had no idea it was an African specialty). When I asked about it they brought me a complimentary glass - so much better than the canned stuff! I'll be back on a weekend to try the okra stew."}
{"text":"So I'm Ghana tell you a story about the last time I got together with co-workers for a lunch outing. I was the one stuck with driving everyone and when that happens it's no longer a democracy- I'm Stalin - or for the sake of this review and to be continentally accurate I was instead Mobutu Sese Seko and anyone that didn't wanna go where I wanted to could just GTFO out of the already moving vehicle Hollywood action movie style. Of course I had to deal with the predictable protests about getting ebola/AIDS/Ghanaria/Sleeping Sickness/Malaria/Tuberculosis/etc - just from going to the restaurant which made me realize I'm dragging these fools way out of their freaking comfort zone. The place is called Max's Mukhaase Restaurant and Catering Service. Mukaase means 'kitchen' in Akan, a language spoken over much of the southern half of Ghana. Got that? There's gonna be a quiz. Anyway, we got seated and a Max introduced himself and gave us all menus. I decided to go for the Fufu/Goat Light Soup as it's called on the menu. The menu could use a little more in the descriptions and actually labelling the pictures. Now the one negative or \"con\" here is that although the food is made to order the dishes all came out very slowly until a few of my co-workers - one of them a contract worker figured that by the time we're done and get back and his manager calculates the amount of time he was out on lunch - he'd definitely be a Ghana. (rimshot). Thank you, try the Fufu and Goat soup! That's the last Ghana joke - I promise. So we all decided if we're coming back it's for dinner - on the weekends because they're not open for dinner on the regular weekdays so we won't be in a hurry to get back.    So when I got my Fufu and Goat Light Soup a woman also brought a bowl of water for me to wash my hands in because you usually eat the fufu with your hands and break off little pieces. I quickly told them I would eat it with fork and spoon. Yeah. Diehard Western ingrained ideas of how to eat a soup suddenly took over for a moment. Even so I ended up eating the last pieces of goat with my hand anyway. Soup was tomato based and rather spicy. Goat was good - a little chewy which is why I finally ate the rest of the pieces by hand. Fufu - a mixture of cassava and plantains - consistency - close as I can think of in comparison is Japanese mochi or specifically ozoni that is served for New Year's. Not really having any flavor - rather playing the straight man to the spicy soup and the goat meat. One of my co-workers had the hot pepper sauce - I tried a bit of it and according to everyone on my table my face turned red all of a sudden - even though I didn't feel it was that hot. They have a few items for folks for whom just walking through the door to a Ghanaian restaurant was already too much of an adventure to handle - club sandwich, burger, sausage roll, and a hot dog. Vegetarians can get the stuffed zucchini with peanut butter sauce or the catering pasta. There's also a bunch of dishes that are only available on the weekend. Lotsa parking cause it's in a mall. Below is a cheat sheet for help with the menu:  JOLLOF (\"one pot\") rice - usually made with rice, tomatoes and tomato paste, onions, salt, and hot red pepper. Beyond that, nearly any kind of meat, vegetable, or spice can be added.  WAAKYE - a Ghanaian dish of cooked rice and black-eyed peas coloured with an indigenous leaf to make it purple-brown. It is prepared by boiling the beans and rice together. GARI - cassava tubers peeled, washed and grated or crushed to produce a mash after being drained for a few days then fried in a clay frying pot. Comes in either white (fried without palm oil) or yellow (fried with palm oil). FUFU - boiled starchy food made from cassava and plantains pounded into a dough-like consistency with a pestle and mortar. RED RED - a Ghanaian black-eyed peas and meat stew served with fried ripe plantain that earns its name from the red pepper and red palm oil that tints the black-eyed peas stew and the bright orange color of the fried ripe plantain. BANKU - is a Ghanaian dish which is cooked by a proportionate mixture of fermented corn and cassava dough in hot water into a smooth, whitish consistent paste and then wrapped in plastic KENKEY - similar to a sourdough dumpling - usually made from ground corn mixed with water and fermented for a few days - then half of it is cooked and then mixed with the other uncooked half throughly and wrapped in banana leaves or corn husks.  EGUSI - Sauce usually made from roasted finely ground or pureed egusi (a melon resembling a watermelon found in West Africa) seeds that give it a smoky, nutty character. Pumpkin seeds are sometimes used instead.  TUO ZAAFI - dish originating in Northern Ghana consisting primarily of maize dough with salt and water to taste SPHE BOLG (Spaghetti Bolognese) - Boiled spaghetti with Oil, fresh tomatoes, minced beef, white pepper, mixed herb, salt, gravy, cheese."}
{"text":"Love, Love, Love the joloff rice at this restaurant! Coming from NYC, where joloff is aplenty as well as my Own Mother's Nigerian homemade cooking, this restaurant has made my new home base in Arizona much more pleasing! It's a 30 minute drive from Queen Creek to Mesa for this food, so you know it's worth it!"}
{"text":"My go to Ghanaian restaurant! I am a Ghanaian and this place has delicious, authentic Ghanaian food at a reasonable price! New location vibe is great. If your not Ghanaian I recommend starting with jollof rice...or step out of your comfort zone and picking something randomly, you will not be disappointed either way!"}
{"text":"Favorite African food. Have to stop by at least once a week. Very friendly staff and wiener. Good quality with good pricing"}
{"text":"This place is kind of a hole in the wall. We visited here looking through the Yelp and Google reviews, and felt it was ok for the money. We tried the goat stew and grilled chicken, and both were above average. The goat curry could've used a little more meat, although the curry tasted good. The chicken dish was nothing spectacular, but had a interestingly different taste to it. I would recommend this place for everyone to try at least once, as this can be an acquired taste. Prices were decent, but with the restaurant certificates it's totally worth the money."}
{"text":"I had the fried red snapper with jollof rice. Red snapper was raw! Crispy outside but the inside was raw and room temperature. Instead of frying a new fish, they took the bottom half of the fish to fry again. Since the fish had sauce, the fish didn't have a good flavor after it was refr√≠ed. I also tried the goat stew with black beans and rice. Rice was super dry, lacked seasoning and flavor. Goat stew was tough, it could have been cooked longer to reach tenderness. Beef patty was basic, I was expecting something similar to a Jamaican patty, dominican empanada, filipino empanada. It was a simple mushy meat patty. The dough was flaky , but the filling lacked flavor. The best thing was the hot sauce paste that came with the goat and rice dish.  Plantains were oily and not drained on a paper towel. It was quite disappointing. At the end of our meal, a roach popped up on the wall.  I have had African food and all types of food,  not impressed with this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Max is a charming man to start with. So humble and welcoming. I had a fantastic time with my sister.   On to the food!!!  My goodness is it AMAZING!  We had the lightsoup with fufu aka aponchi kakraa and it was so delicious and filling!! It was an ample serving of protein and carbs alike. I made sure to finish every ounce of it. Beware guys food coma alert. This is no joke- chale! it takes me back to chop bar days and you'd be hard pressed to find Ghanaian cuisine as authentic as this.   Our fufu was served in a traditional bowl the apotoyiwa (hurray!!)- a blackened fired clay bowl with a grooved pattern in it. Max even followed up with a bowl of water to wash our hands which was extremely humbling to us.  It's a must visit every time we're in town!!"}
{"text":"Oohhhhhhhhhh yes. The deliciousness. At this moment I have completed my meal of goat meat, rice, and eggs with some gari sprinkled on top. After leaving the gym this meal definitely hit the spot. My stomach is thanking me multiple times over for treating it to this glorious good.  An additional pro is that the allow you to customize your meal quite a bit. I requested more meat and less of everything else, and it came just the way I wanted it.  P.s. try the Star beer, it's actually pretty good."}
{"text":"This place has moved from its previous location on Guadalupe.  When we visited they were still getting settled, installing TVs and doing something with ceiling tiles.  The owner (I assume he was the owner) was a very friendly and eager person.  I found out through conversation that this cuisine is actually Ghanan.  The menu isn't too long, but there are a variety of choices.  I ordered the beef stew jollof rice, my wife ordered goat stew with waakye and gari.    I got a beef in red sauce (no potatoes or carrots or anything else, so I hesitate to call it 'stew'), a hard-boiled egg, a large portion of rice (jollof), and some plaintains.    It turned out the goat wasn't ready, so they substituted beef on my wife's meal.  She got the same beef I had, plus a rice/beans mixture (I believe that was the waakye), a small amount of pasta, and a hard-boiled egg.  Plus she got a cup of grated cassava and another of chili sauce.  Working backwards here, beware the chili sauce.  It could probably dissolve metal.  Wow.  If we understood the woman (I assume owner's wife) it was made with ghost chilies. Yowza.  I like spicy food, but too much of this and you will be suffering.  It and the cassava were meant to be used on the rice/beans.  The hard-boiled egg was just a hard-boiled egg, except they didn't really do it right.  The green layer was present on the outside of the yolk indicating it had not been cooked properly (too long and too hot, I believe).  The rice/beans was pretty bland, but adding the cassava and a tiny bit of the chili sauce really helped.  My wife really liked the plantains.  My jollof was very nice without adding anything to it.  And the beef was a sort of tangy slightly sour sauce.  All in all, very good.  Another patron also gave us a sample of the corn meal/bread.  It is very doughy, but not raw.  The flavor was VERY sour.  I pretty much couldn't eat it by itself.  It reminded me of the thin tortilla-like bread of an Ethiopian place we tried. There you tore off pieces of the bread and used it to grab the entree items.  Very similar flavor to this doughy bread at Max's.  If you dip it in the beef stew sauce it works.  I can see coming back to try some other things.  Some different flavors from a cuisine that is not very common in the USA."}
{"text":"I'm surprised this place is still standing. I like their food but I don't like their price. My brother ordered food here and we never went again because it is way to pricey for food that doesn't look too appetizing. I will give it a shot again maybe when I grace some Native African cooking."}
{"text":"Warning, this review is from a white person who has never had authentic African food.  The reviews for this restaurant are all very good so you can obviously take mine with a grain of salt. I am just going to be honest. When we arrived there was only 1 other customer there who was getting food to go. While we were there no other customers arrived until we were almost ready to go & I think they were getting take out too. If you like ESPN2 you'll be happy as there were 2 TVs with it & you can hear the audio as there is no Muzak or anything to distract from it...other than the buzzing / beeping sound that came from the front door area, about every 30 seconds. I read reviews beforehand to get an idea of what to expect so when the food took a long time I was not that surprised.  I was surprised that there was a bone in the teriyaki chicken & rice we ordered and my husband was not very happy that the soda he ordered was just served in an aluminum can with no offer of a glass of ice.  I found it strange that there was a bottle of Softsoap hand soap on many of the tables like they were included in the centerpiece. I was not impressed by the fact that the back of the chairs had dirty handprints on them (they are light wood) & there were 2 sticky sesame seeds on the tablecloth in front of me when I sat down.  When we were done eating my husband went up front to get the check & pay. He was told the person who knows how to use the register was not there. We had to decide whether to use the ATM & leave a big tip or wait longer to be able to use our card. We decided to use our card.  As we were waiting, an elderly woman came over to our table & used a paper napkin (from the napkin dispenser on the table) to wipe the rice of the tablecloth. It might just be me but I thought that would be better done AFTER we had left & using a warm soapy washcloth or some kind of disinfectant might be a good idea. Overall we were not impressed & don't plan on going back again but the man who waited on us was friendly. Just not our cup of tea."}
{"text":"Sat down they had a large party with over 20 people and only 1 waiter. Some came out of the kitchen and sat at the bar stools and put his leg up on one and he was in his bear feat. That's all we had to see so we walked out"}
{"text":"I am truly perplexed by the fact that there are some less than 5 star reviews lol. I have nothing but amazing things to say about this place. 1) this enterprise is very well managed. Very clean, owners and those who attended to us were very nice and welcoming. I must say, an accurate representation of the warmness and joy of welcoming people by Africans. 2) the food is DELICIOUS! As a frequenter of African cuisine around the US, I make it a mission to find African restaurants during my frequent trips, the quality of food at Max's is among the top 3. 3) Prices are reasonable. Service is top notch. If you are not sure what to order, ask. I like my food spicy, and I know Ghanaians are not all about that life, but I asked and it was made to my preference. There was a delicious habanero on my fufu. Just how I like it I am coming back and bringing my posse. They say when you find something good, share with good people. Yes, you heard it from me."}
{"text":"So it's been over 25 mins and my food has yet to arrive. In terms of service and cleanliness this restaurant is much less desired. There are stains towards the back of the register counter and though I didn't dine-in appears they give you a bowl of water to wash your hands w/ soap- definitely unsanitary.   Now after finally receiving my food after 25 plus minutes of waiting it was not as I expected. The goat meat was on the tougher end and sauce that was provided was less desired. Also for $12.50 for an entree, I figured they serve quality type of ingredients. The sauce did not taste fresh at all. Nevertheless if your willing to wait, eat tough meat, and pay more than what it's worth give this place a try!"}
{"text":"The food is pretty authentic and generous portions are served. Staff is friendly and accommodating to all. Just bring lots of patience as it takes 45 mins to an hour on average to get your food. Granted the first bite of your meal will make the wait worthwhile."}
{"text":"DINING EXPERIENCE: 1/5 We came on a Sunday with a party of four after purchasing a $15 for $24 worth of food Groupon. They open at 1 and the doors opened at 1:10. There was one other party there, but they were waiting for takeout. They are either friends of the owner or frequent diners, so they were hanging out at the counter the entire time. We sat down and it was about 10min until we were given menus. They took our order and 15min later we received water bottles. Then 15min later we received our utensils. We got our food around 2:10pm. When we were settling the tab around 2:30pm, they were just writing down the Sunday specials on a board and turned on the music. That would have been nice to know beforehand! It seemed like only then was the restaurant fully-opened. The whole experience was just odd and very slow for being the ONLY dine-in party.   Friends came in and out of the store...perhaps that is why we had such an oddball service? Maybe they were distracted? It seems like this may be a common scenario though. Another observation, the restaurant received quite a few calls for take out orders during the course of the meal.  Perhaps that is the way to go. I definitely won't be back for the dine-in experience.   FOOD: 4/5 I enjoyed my meal. I ordered the goat stew, waakye and gari plate. It came with pasta and blackbean/rice. The black bean/rice was a bit dry, but the sauce from the goat stew was phenomenal, and coupled with the hot sauce that was included on the plate in the plastic container was to die for! The goat stew sauce had a strong tomato base so that paired well with the pasta as well. That hot sauce...they should bottle it up and sell it!! Amazing flavor and perfect amount of heat.  Rounded up my rating to 3 mainly for that hot sauce. Wish I didn't have to be so critical on the dine-in experience but it's just been one of the weirdest I've had in a while."}
{"text":"Wonderful restaurant! I had been craving some goat and decided to check out Max's. The customer service was awesome. Max explained all the options on the menu enthusiastically and the food came out pretty fast. I had the goat platter with garri and rice and blackeye peas on the side. The sauce was pleasantly spicy and the portions were large enough for leftovers. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Max's Mukhaase African Restaurant 1245 W. Guadalupe Road Mesa, AZ  85202  A group of eight of us arrived for dinner at 6:00. The place, while small is comfortable and friendly. We were delighted that Max personally came out to wait on our table.  Most of us started off with soft drinks. I had a homemade ginger beer (non-alcoholic) with mango juice. For those not familiar, ginger beer is like a hyped up ginger ale, made with lots of real ginger and very spicy. This was a terrific drink that was made for sipping and not drinking. Powerful but delicious.  I ordered a plate of fried plantains with peanuts for the table. When my bill arrived later, it was not on the bill, and I told Max that he made a mistake. He informed me that it was on the house.  Main courses were varied and were, for the most part enjoyed by all. I ordered goat soup with fufu (pounded starch in the shape of a large dumpling). It was totally delicious. Companion ordered peanut butter soup with chicken, which was not enjoyed as much because of the oil that was released from the peanuts that floated to the top.  Another companion ordered a goat stew, which was accompanied by a mixture of beans and rice and was pronounced very good. Yet another companion ordered tilapia which was nicely fried and plated. Also ordered was fried rice and chicken which was quickly devoured.  I also ordered a homemade ginger beer with pineapple that was a wonderful accompaniment to my goat soup.  By the end of the meal we were all so stuffed that we could hardly move. The place is clean, and service is on the slower side due to each dish being made to order. I must add that Max is a terrific host. He seems to always have a smile on his face, and will do whatever is necessary to make his guests happy.  4 stars for excellent food, good service, and the big smile on Max's face."}
{"text":"Love the food, love the atmosphere,  I'll recommend the waakye and goat stew or if you're feeling brave, the tuo zaafi. The chef and staff are really friendly."}
{"text":"Review 1/10 for the 10 bookmarked businesses to review before the end of 2016! From Meagan B.'s thread: https://www.yelp.com/topic/phoenix-yelp-phoenixs-10-firsts-of-2016  I had Max's on my bookmark list for some time. We decided to try them out for lunch on Sunday. We got there right at 1 when they opened and there were already a few orders placed for to-go meals.   It took some time for someone to actually come to our table and hand us menus. When we got our orders in, we had more of a wait until another person came by to ask us what we wanted to drink. I ended up getting the MM09, listed as \"Yam, plantain, palaver sauce\" ($14.99). You have your choice of sweet/ripe plantain or more starchy/green plantain.   Our dishes came out and they were a very generous portion. I was surprised to see a grilled fish on my plate since it wasn't listed on the ingredients for the platter but hey if they are throwing in a fish for my meal why not? The fish itself was tender and flaky on the outer portions with crisp skin but the center of the fish was still raw. The plantain and yam were very basic, whole chunks with no other seasoning. I did enjoy the palaver sauce, which was a chunky spinach based mixture. I also tried a bite of the goat stew which was rich and flavorful. The goat meat had a clean taste to it, not gamey at all. I also tried some fried rice which was decent, but the real star of the show was the amazing sauce it was served with. It had a spicy punch to it that I thoroughly enjoyed.   I probably wouldn't eat here again to dine in due to the slow service. I might get a meal to go though. While everyone was very friendly, it took a long time to actually eat here due to all the waiting. If you prefer more of a laid back leisurely meal though this might be your place.  2.5/5."}
{"text":"So far I've only tried the Beef Jollof, and it was delicious. Friendly staff and amazing flavors. Everyone should give this place a try."}
{"text":"Excellent is how I describe the peanut butter soup I had. The broth, rice and meat were cooked to absolute perfection. I wish I would have know about this place long ago...I can't wait to go back to explore more things on the menu."}
{"text":"Very unique! Ask for the root drink. It is a strong gin based drink that is really flavorful for the type of person that can enjoy hard sprits straight. The food was really good we will be back. The flavors and effort brought to the food were spot on. If you want to try something new and delicious stop here."}
{"text":"It felt like we came to someone's not so clean house and had a dinner prepared by an old woman who had never married and never learned to cook.  We had meat pie, fufu soup, and beef jollof with burnt beef. Burnt! I had never eaten burnt meat at the restaurants. Tomato sauce was made with weird, non-attractive, spices. Rice pilaf was overly dry and old. Meat pie was okay, not too memorable. Fufu was a big dough ball in the spicy tomato-based soup, boring and bland.  Water was in the form of water bottles.  Lady who waited on us was dressed in track suit, didn't smile at all, and didn't hear our order correctly. She brought only one meat pie when we ordered two.   Place looked run down and very old."}
{"text":"I order the peanut butter soup, vegetarian style and he makes it fresh each time. It's my favorite dish and it's absolutely delicious. I also love going in and chatting with him! Such a friendly place. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I was in the mood for something that tasted home cooked and filling and got it right here. My brother and I each ordered something different and both meals were amazing! The owner served us and was very personable and helped us pick out our order since we had no idea what we wanted. The peanut butter soup was so amazing! We'll be coming back. I wanna try out the rest of the menu!"}
{"text":"Delicious food, hearty portion sizes, friendly and fun atmosphere...couldn't have asked for more!! The chef is pretty good here. I've tried a lot of the meals and they are all absolutely delicious! The restaurant is spacious and bright and the menu also comes with pictures so you know exactly what you are ordering. This is now my go to African restaurant!"}
{"text":"I was a bit disappointed. The service was okay. Great conversation, but after a long day I don't want to chit chat or make small talk. Thought it was super unprofessional to have your baby behind the counter while you are servicing a restaurant. I get it. It was late and business was slow, but still your baby is your top priority. My groupon was not honored because it was only credited of it were two people dining in. My friend recommended it also I got food to go. Needless to say I wasn't a fan and probably won't go back not because it was horrible, food was okay. But that's it. It was just okay. Noting impressive enough to make me want to return."}
{"text":"Again my Jamaican wife came thru with African for dinner. This is authentic and delicious. Nice and busy with culture in the air.  Eat here."}
{"text":"This is a particularly difficult review for me to write.  I have my concerns.   I am American, but come from a family of immigrants (from India).  My wife is an immigrant from Vietnam.   On 07/07/2016 my wife and I went to Max's Mukhaase for dinner.  We arrived at around 6:15 PM.  The following are my observations:  1) The place needs climate control.  It is so hot.  Please either fix the air conditioner, or please use it.  Please close the doors, and let the air conditioner do its function and manage the heat.   2) Please seriously look into how the front and the back are managed.  It appears as though you have a lot of wait staff just sitting around, not knowing what to do.  There needs to be a set routine regarding cleaning, tending to customers, and managing the front.  Please set some ground rules.  It appears as though there is absolutely no management on the front of the business.   3) My wife and I were seated at 6:15 PM on 07/07/2016.  We received our food at 8:00 PM.  The average person would have walked off, and not waited.  Was it worth the wait?  4) The manner in which the food is served makes all of the difference.  Try to serve all parties at a table at the same time.  We were lucky this happened, but we saw many customers where there was a gap of time of nearly 45 minutes.  In the West, this is inexcusable.    5) The noise level was actually very excessive.  I know it is a party atmosphere, and it is crowded, but turning down the music appropriately helps.    6) Also the management of food preparation needs to be looked at.  This perhaps goes back to the business model you have.  You need to find ways to be more efficient in the kitchen, the back end.  You need to find ways to make the food with appropriate quality, relative to the cost, in a timely manner. Seriously look at how you can increase capacity (maybe a kitchen manager is needed?  Maybe a skilled helper?).  What can be pre-made?  What is fast moving?  What is slow moving?    This may mean paring down the menu to a few things.  This may mean restructuring to having a buffet only.  This may mean going from a full restaurant to going to a walkup kiosk at a food court.  This may mean scaling back and only doing catering.  You may only want to do a take-out and nothing else.    7) As you can see, I have not even mentioned directly on the food yet.  The food quality was okay, but there are a few things that concern me.  My wife and I ordered: * Goat Stew, Waakye, Gari and Salad * Banku, Kenkey and Talapia * Stuffed Zucchini with Peanut Butter Sauce  This goat was very chewy (barely edible).  We took it home as leftovers, and it ended up in the rubbish bin because of this.  The sauce was good, but it was just too chewy.   For the talapia [sic] it was smelly, though cooked."}
