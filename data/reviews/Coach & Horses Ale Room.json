{"text":"I will preface this with, I spent 11 years as a bartender and server...I get it, I really get it, how hard the job can be!

So this review is more aimed at the management who allows such understaffing to happen, that patrons walk out. 

We came in for Sunday breakfast around 10:15-10:20 AM.  Instead of established sections, the servers seemed to be alternating tables as they came in, from one side of the bar to the other.  

Two tables (right beside us) came in about 10 minutes after us and were promptly served and orders taken by the other server. Our order was taken at 10:45....two simple breakfast bowls. 

At 11:15, the two other tables had finished their breakfasts, we were still waiting. I had tracked down my own coffee and even offered the carafe to other tables. 

At this point, we hadn't seen our server and the other server was even looking at our table in askance. We got up, went to the bar, offered to pay for our coffee and juice (which the bartender declined) and we left. 

To the management of The Coach & Horses...if don't staff your floor appropriately, I suspect we won't be your only walk-out...management is more than welcome to contact me for further details."}
{"text":"If you want pub grub in the deep south, this is the place to go. I have never seen a menu so extensive. Pizza (the best), burgers, appies, fish & chips, stir fry, yorkshires, yummy fries.........the list goes on and on. They are great for groups as there's lots of room to sit. Only down side is the temp. I always have to wear my coat cause its so friggin cold in there."}
{"text":"Coach & Horses is probably one of the best places for wing (night) Wednesday. Located in the heart of Millrise with easy access from Macleod Trail and minutes away from Shawnessy station, Coach & Horses offered a diverse alternative from your typical neighbourhood pub.

While looking at the menu and around the pub, C&H has a wide varieties of food and beverages, 16 HD TVs, 3 pool tables, a south facing patio, and it looks like 27 beers on tap - maybe more or less I wasn't accurate on my count since I was seated from a far.

One of Coach & Horses' weekly evening specials includes wing (night) Wednesday which starts at 4pm until close. With 0.25 cent per wing (minimum of 10) and a minimum beverage purchase required (water does not count) you get to choose from 16 different sauces. Also a pint of Rickard's Red or White and a bottle of Heineken are on special too.)

Depending on what time you go you may be greeted right away when you first enter through their doors or just a simple smile since the servers are busy waiting tables. Like all pubs there are no seating arrangements it's basically a first come first serve / free for all, if you find a spot take it or else the next person will.

Let's talk about the wings. To me I found that the Coach & Horses' wings are plumped, well fried, seasoned to perfection and sauced properly. Unfortunately they don't do half and half sauce so if you're debating between the two you can always order the sauce on the side or order again for another round. Secretly you can do what I do, have them mixed together. My girlfriend ordered the standard wings with hot mixed with Phoenix and I ordered the standard 10 wings and asked for sweet Chili sauce on top of that I asked for the sauce to be mixed with Thai sesame and have a pinch of salt and pepper to taste plus a basket of yam fries with chipotle sauce. The wait time wasn't that long, the order came in a timely manner. I've already talked about the wings earlier but the yam fries on the other hand, man when they said \"basket of fries\" they really mean it. The \"basket\" was the same plating size as the wings, loaded, and perfect fried and salted. The chipotle sauce on the other was okay I'm not a big fan of their chipotle since I'm use to a more orange texture with more heat but hey chipotle sauce is chipotle sauce.

Overall Coach & Horses is a +1 for me and a recommended place for wing (night) Wednesday. I'll probably be back for another wing night or another day to try out their other weekly evening specials."}
{"text":"For a pub, you really can't do much better.  Good service, great food, fair prices, clean place.  Sometimes it gets a little cold in the restaurant, so maybe bring a hoodie."}
{"text":"Classic pub decor and atmosphere. A pub can be rated on either its service, or its food, since drinks are pretty standard across the board. While our service was pretty good, my rating is dragged down by the food.  While the patio was nice, the menu selection wide-ranging, and the COLLOSAL appetizer sampler at the table next to us looked tempting, our mains missed the mark somewhat. 

The wienerschnitzel did not have anything even resembling a crispy breading.  Improved communication between the kitchen and wait staff would have been nice, as I discussed ordering a Caesar salad as the side choice instead of mashed potatoes, based on the dish coming standard with roasted squash anyway.  Unbeknownst to the server, the kitchen was out of squash, and so I ended up with no starch at all.  My wife had the strip loin, which was cooked rare as ordered (it's amazing how often kitchens can't get this right), but nothing to write home about in terms of flavor or accompaniments. While none of this ruins an evening, surely 4 and 5 star ratings should be reserved for superelative performance, no?

In short, go here for drinks and appys (and maybe standards like burgers, as other reviewers have noted), but there are much better pubs in town for real food."}
{"text":"Typical worn pub. Not sure how often they clean the keg lines as the beer tastes a bit \"off\" service has rarely been acceptable and always slow. The food is a crapshoot sometimes good and other times not so good."}
{"text":"Pretty standard as pubs go, food could be better, nacho cheese mix does not go on French onion soup. South end is tough for finding good spots"}
{"text":"Came in to watch the UFC fight with a friend on Friday. Friend ordered the Irish Stew and I ordered the chicken wings and a bowl of Seafood Chowder. My friend ended up sending the Irish Stew back to the kitchen after one bite, claiming it tasted \"sour\". The wings I had were average at best, and the Seafood Chowder was luke warm, and practically nothing but potato and vegetables, with no actual seafood that I could find. We decided it was the first and last time we would be ordering food at the Coach and Horse pub. Beers were ok, but they were bottled beers, so it would be pretty difficult for them to ruin that."}
{"text":"How much can you really say about a pub? It's a pretty standard pub, offering the same selection beers as every other standard pub in the south. What sets this place apart is the crowd and the space.

The Coach has been my go-to pub in the south for a long time now. It attracts an older crowd; sports fans, metal heads, and mostly men. You won't find many hipsters, kids that think they are too cool for school, or any loud obnoxious types. It's just a great casual sausage fest every night. The large venue is always busy, but somehow I always end up finding a table (Unlike Hudson's... ugh). And let's not forget, their potato nachos are my favourite! You can't be too picky with pub fare, but this place does it better than most.

I've been to every pub south of Fish Creek Provincial Park, and the Coach is definitely my favourite. 

Hmm... I should make a list."}
{"text":"Only take credit card and cash!!!!  I stopped in for a quick bite and it happened to be wing night....it was a Sunday I believe...i got a couole orders of wings and they were fine.  Had a couple pints...asked for the bill and was informed at that time that they only take cash or credit.  I only had my debit card and $30 cash on me.  The bartender got about a 50 cent tip. Not his fault because that's all I had. Won't be back.  Who doesn't take debit???  Seriously.  No wonder Dixon's (a couple blocks away) is always busy and this place isn't."}
{"text":"Excellent option for Wednesday nights and Sundays, when it is a chicken wings night. On Sunday they have chicken wings promotions starting in lunch time. 
One of the top chicken wings of the city."}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere, there is always a fantastic special everyday of the week. The staff is really friendly, food and drinks come out promptly."}
{"text":"Good food and usually good service but tonight's service was awful. No one in the place and yet waitress could not be bothered with us."}
{"text":"This is a great enviroment to grab a drink or some food with friends, coworkers, family, etc.

It's a good, clean pub; never dirty or sketchy, I've never witnessed a rowdy situation or encountered someone being beligerently drunk.  
The food is great, the menu has a wide variety and it is all good quality pub food. I absolutely looove nachoes, and the Coach & Horses' nachoes definetly do not disapoint.  Plus the service is great! Some of the nicest bartenders and servers in Calgary.

This is hands-down my favorite place to grab a drink. I come here quite often and always have a great time!"}
{"text":"Look up the word \"Pub\" in the dictionary and you'll find this in it. Nothing much special in it.. I would say ordinary and merely you'd find anything special in there.

I had the same feeling of it being a Jaimeson's pub. ofcourse except this place has its pool table if you have a dollar and a quarter. 

It would be a great place to just hang out and chill but the longer you stay the more you'd expect to pay. Nothing out of the ordinary on their dishes either and I have to say a little bit much on the pricy side. I have the general feeling that I'd be spending atleast $20 for every visit here. Ofcourse that depends on your order and how long you'd be staying there.

Regards their service I would say nothing out of the ordinary. Can't even entirely say if the smiles are purely genuine or just a mask made to lighten up your pocket.

Either way I'm not complaining. I had fun with friends don't have much else to comment on the place."}
{"text":"been here a few times and really should be a 5. the food and specials are great.  today the waitress at the table beside me was very good.  on the patio in the hot sun. she straight up offers her guests WATER and brings it.  I've asked my waitress twice for water and never got it, ive now eaten. after seeing people with the other waitress get water and im dying for a glass. I finally went in to the bar and got it myself.  my waitress sees me order  the water. throws in a straw and lemon wedge and comes over with it all smiley..   thanks...."}
{"text":"The location offers good parking and is handy to many areas in South Calgary.   The interior is nice - modern and clean.  I was surprised at how large it was inside.  

I dropped in for a quick bite.   It was New Year's Day so it was fairly quiet.  The service was ok.

I had shepherd's pie and Mac and cheese as a side.   It was uninspired. The shepherd's pie was from a refrigerator or freezer and heated.  The Mac and cheese seemed to be the same.  Try something else.

With such a large menu this is expected.  A smaller fresh made menu would be better but it is a pub.  

Overall it seems like a good pub.   I would try it again."}
{"text":"Came here on a Thursday evening, It was quite busy but the service was still pretty good. I came here for the soul reason that they had Purple Gas from Big Rock Breweries on tap. I called around to the other pubs in the Shawnessy area and got a NO WE DON\"T from all of them. 
On this particular night they had deep fried shrimp on special. .38 cents ea. with a minimum of 10 to an order. They also had mussels in a white wine and garlic sauce. I don't remember the price on the mussels, but you ordered that by the lb.
The food and drinks came out in a relatively timely fashion. Overall my experience was good. The only negative was when the shrimp came out, it didn't come with any seafood sauce. We had to ask for that ?    
Anyhow. I'll be back again to see what else they have on the menu. All the food that was coming out around us, looked tasty."}
{"text":"Sunday felt like a pub night so since C&H is just down the way from us we decided to check it out!

It is fully decorated in wood tables/chairs but we found a nice little booth to settle into. 

I thought the menu wasn't bad, they had some good sounding burgers/sandwiches and most items were defiantly pub food - so not many healthy choices. I found the beer selection to be pretty good. 

The service was average; I ordered a bottle of Kronenbourg Blanc and got a pint of Kronenbourg 1664 instead which was a letdown but i didn't mind much.

I ordered the Phoenix chicken burger, it was pretty big and had a nice kick to it. I wasn't a fan of the side of fries since they tasted like they were double fried and resembled KFC fries. If you like those then you'll like these. 

I would like to go back and try lunch or maybe the brunch one time."}
{"text":"A great neighborhood pub. Be warned: if you order their platter (amazing by the way), it can feed an army!!! The value for it is amazing!!!
We love their pizza as well. The only item I'm not a fan of, is their wings (soggy, not crispy). 
Great food, drinks, atmosphere, and service!"}
{"text":"The food is excellent, but occasionally on busy nights it can be slow.  It's best to come when there isn't a game on, and early enough in the evening to miss the rush.  The specials are great, and staff is usually there when you need them.  Service can be slow, though, even when things aren't too busy.  They don't take debit either, which can sometimes put me in a bit of a lurch, but there is an ATM should you need it.  I'd give the food 5 stars overall, as it's excellent, but the service and high prices are what make me give it 4 stars overall.  This might make me sound crotchety too, but the servers all wear super short skirts, which, if by choice, is all well and good.  But I can't help but wonder if it's a management thing.  They all often seem pretty run down as well, but that might be me reading into it.  I think, as a whole, more staff would help these problems out significantly.  I have no intention of not coming here again, since it is an excellent pub and the food is great.  If you have time or are looking for a place to eat at an earlier hour than 7 or so, I'd say definitely try the Coach."}
{"text":"Like this place but for one complaint...it's always unnecessarily noisy for two reasons, music is too loud and folks have to yell at each other, and the acoustics are horribly, turn the tunes off or down during busier crowds and the place would be more comfortable,  I have to drag folks back because they don't care for the noise, make my job easier and cut the tunes during happy hour or at least until later in the evening so folks can socialize...without the noisy background music, folks will not need to be louder and thus the over sound level will drop...don't believe me? Ask your customers....if they can hear you!!"}
{"text":"If you enjoy waiting and having to go find your server then this is the pub for you.
15 minutes to get a beer. We were not sure if our server worked there or was a patron. She seemed confused. Then another 30 minutes to get served our food. Im not sure which butcher shop they went to purchase the meet at.
The only reason for a star was the burger was not bad."}
{"text":"Another convenient local pub down south Calgary. Coach and Horses Ale has a great open space that allows me to converse with my friends, as well as the ability to view the room and \"people watch\". It's one of the few pubs me and my friends can ever agree on visiting.

For approximately 15 dollars, depending on what extra items you get, their plate of Nachos can be a righteous pub snack that can be shared with a table of at least three grown men. Careful not to hog all the chips with the Jalepenos, your derriere will hate you in the morning :S  

Their beer and drink menu is great with prices that are about the same as the other local pubs around (Dixons, Bull & Finch).

The service is great, the waitresses are friendly and efficient, and don't bat their eyelashes at you in order to squeeze tips. I mean come on, trying to have a manversation here."}
{"text":"went to Coach for dinner...awesome food and great service!  Lauren went above and beyond to make our experience amazing!  Will definitely be going back!!!"}
{"text":"The service on wing night is usually really good . Every time I order Any other food on Wing night it takes about 20 mins or more. Oh and THEY DONT TAKE DEBIT !! The owner put a ATM there so he makes money off the service fee YOU pay. Other than that, pretty good place."}
{"text":"Went here with a group of friends and it is great that they have pool tables and a big open local bar in the burbs! 
As for the food, I had smoked salmon taquitos that were just alright they were the best. They hardly had any smoky taste but rather were really sour because of too much lime juice on them but they also had cream cheese in the tortilla which made them good. 
The inside of the pub is also darker than the average pub especially during the day. They keep the blinds down and close don the windows and the light very dim which I did not like. 
I had two delicious drinks- one was a strawberry cider and the other was a strawberry float which I highly recommend."}
{"text":"slow service but great beer. Had Rickers brown ale and some amazing greek flavor plus parmesan hot wings. Its been a while I had such an amazing experience over wings. 

Advise to the manager- please
Review your google posting. It says you are open till 2am. But you guys actually closes at mid night. That was a bummer. 1 star less for that."}
{"text":"Amazing! Simply the best experience I've have ever had in a pub! Josh was took customer service to a new level, it was my best friends birthday and our first time here and we will be back with many of our friends !!! FYI they have the most loyal friendly awesome patrons !"}
{"text":"As you have read in other reviews, Coach & Horses is one of the better pubs you'll find in south Calgary. The food has been excellent every time I've been as has the service. This place could easily be a 5 star if not for two things, and even as I write this I admit they are petty and possibly more testaments to the quality of the establishment rather than weaknesses. 

Firstly, I have considered myself very fortunate to find seating whenever I've come here. This is not necessarly a bad thing, just more of a warning to people. And secondly, although I can attest the food is top notch, the menu is too deep. I'm always leery of pubs with menu's so large that I need to rest halfway through reading. I find that smaller menu's are usually full of items that they can consistently knock out of the park."}
{"text":"Good competition for the new Hudsons that just opened up near by.  Good sized crowd and the right atmosphere to have an after work drink."}
{"text":"Haven't reviewed this favourite spot in a while. Some great summer appies on the menu for $8. I especially enjoyed the jalapeño poppers. Also, wine is on special on Thursdays. Great value!"}
{"text":"Coach and horses is definitely one of the stand out pubs/eateries in the S.E. I have been here about 5 times and every one of those times have been consistent and quite solid in service, food and drinks. With a big selection of brew and a menu that has some standout items, the appeal of coach and horses always flashes in my head when looking for a decent pub. 

This place is BIG, a lot of seating and like 4 different \"zones\" to choose from. Even when I have come hear at peak hours and it seems  crowded, I have never had any trouble finding seats.  

For the food I have not been very adventurous here. I tried the coach burger the first time I was their and out fear of getting something that is not good (always risky at places with big menus!) I stick with the coach burger. It is quite hefty in size and fills me up well! Every time I have ordered the burger it has been very good. Maybe next time I go its time to branch out, I will have to see how I feel....

So if one is in the southeast and looking for a Nice pubby place, coach and horses should fit the bill! The crowd that seems to frequent here is a little bit rowdy and the music they play is radio drool but its a pub so.. so be it! Come check it !"}
{"text":"Was here for wing night (Wednesday $.25). 
Pub was packed, but the servers were very good and felt looked after. Kitchen was fast, even faster than the servers expected."}
{"text":"A perfect burger! So delish!  And the mash potatoes! And gravy! Mmm.  And the service? Jessica is great,  does a great job, and helps that she's gorgeous.   I think I may have found my next haunt.   Great atmosphere,  people laughing from the belly. 
Surprisingly fret for a Monday night.  Great spot."}
{"text":"Pretty basic unpretentious pub. Good place to hang out, shoot some pool and have a few drinks. Decent selection of beers with a different special every night on food and drink. Sometimes the food can be a bit salty- watch out for the seafood chowder- but usually it's fine.

Wing night (Wednesday) is a good night to visit. The wings are inexpensive at 25c each, available in a selection of flavours and are cooked properly- not undercooked and not burnt. My favourite would probably be the Jamaican Jerk, honey garlic or BBQ flavours; wasn't too impressed by the tandoori (smelt great but the taste didn't deliver much) or Greek (too dry for my liking) flavours.

I'm probably a little biased because it's my local pub and I go there quite frequently, but that's what it is- a good pub with a pub atmosphere and decent pub food. The clientèle tends to be a little older than many other pubs in the area which suits me fine. I couldn't imagine travelling across the city to come here, but of the pubs in this area it's the one I usually tend to go to."}
