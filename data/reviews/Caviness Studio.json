{"text":"I recently had the pleasure of working with Good Dae Studio, (Sandee) on a T-shirt I wanted done. She helped me through the project and made me feel comfortable, although I had no idea what I was doing or what I really wanted on the shirt! She is extremely polite, helpful and overall she seemed like a good and caring person! I would do business with her again in a heartbeat! The quality of work was great, the price was fair and I received my items within a timely manner!"}
{"text":"I had a custom t-shirt order designed and silk screen printed by the Good Dae team and the end result was awesome. Great communication during the design phase, great attention to detail even when I requested a few last minute changes. When I got the final t-shirts, the shirt quality was first rate, the imprinting was sharp and clean, and all on time and on budget. In short, Good Dae performed way above what I expected and the shirts for my family re-union were a giant hit. Could not be happier! Thanks Good Dae!"}
{"text":"I found these tees at a street fair--what incredible prices for such fun, unique art! The shirts are great quality--comfy and cute, I liked them so much I bought a couple for gifts. We also needed some tees for work, so placed a custom order and got the same great quality, quick turn-around and a very fair price. Will definitely use them again!"}
{"text":"I have to say that Genna and Sandee are a dynamic design duo!  Their talents compliment each other nicely.  I went to Good Dae to have some t-shirts designed for my friends 50th birthday.  I told Sandee a little about my friend what she likes, what she's into and what she says.  I was totally blown away with the design she came back with.  It was my friend to a \"T\" (pun intended).  It's like Sandee has known my friend for years!!    The t-shirts are super soft, great quality and fit true to size.  If you want a custom designed shirt, Good Dae is your place!  I HIGHLY recommend Genna and Sandee!"}
