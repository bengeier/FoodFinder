{"text":"I thought this is the best Thai noodle place in Pittsburgh.
You have to try once in your life. Wowwwww."}
{"text":"Nice place. Would have given more stars but it was steamy hot inside when outside was pleasant. Food was fresh, well prepared. I had pad peanut vegetables, which were flavorful with the peanut sauce and a \"1\" spice level. 
Good attentive service."}
{"text":"We had the curries which tasted powdery   .The glass noodle salad was good and the mango sticky rice dessert was delicious. We found it quite noisy"}
{"text":"Went last evening with a friend.  Food was okay but not at the level of other Thai places in Squirrel Hill.  And their fan over the cooking area is inadequate so sharp and spicy fumes from the kitchen caused me to cough and my throat and eyes to burn.  Smell was strong enough to permeate my clothing, which I had to air when I got home.  

Also, it is small and, when full, quite noisy, and I was with a soft-spoken friend, so communication was difficult.  In future,I will try it for take-out only."}
{"text":"I have to admit, we didn't come sooner because we thought the Yelp reviews were fake. But no, I think they are real. This is, hands down, the best Thai in Pittsburgh.

The restaurant really does smell like Thailand with pungent fish sauce and hot pepper aromas. I fell in love immediately.

Usually, I test a new Thai restaurant with their pad thai. After all, if a restaurant can't manage an adequate rendition of their country's most popular street food, I'm pretty sure their curries will be creamed into oblivion and their tired veggies will be poured from cans.

Based on smell alone, I did something a little different. I ordered a basic red curry (still a good barometer) and their spaghetti variation on drunken noodles, because I was curious what they were thinking.

The dishes came out beautifully prepared. The spaghetti with reds and greens of fresh peppers, little bunches of green peppercorns and still-green kafir lime leaves.  

You could taste that the ingredients weren't pre-cooked together. Each flavor represented a separate layer on the tongue. I particularly loved the lime in the spaghetti. While I wouldn't order the spaghetti dish again, it certainly wasn't execution that was the issue - I just prefer a more traditional noodle.

I ordered a 10/10 spice level and it was exactly right and the spiciest I've managed to get in Pittsburgh (I usually try for a 15/10 and get served something that's closer to a 3). 

To answer the question that's on everyone's minds: this is NOT just a rebranding of the previous restaurant. I just hope they can keep up this level of quality over time."}
{"text":"Disappointed!! Too sweet to be authentic Thai noodles.
Don't waste your time, just go to the Thai restaurant on S. Highland Ave."}
{"text":"The waitress was extremely unfriendly and refused to serve at 2:40pm. It was an awful experience."}
{"text":"Hi Darlings!

Went with \"The Thai Vegan\" and I gotta admit I was super skeptical, signage looked so oddly generic and the name is so odd. I gave it a whirl and it wasn't bad! I had a tofu and vegetable dish and it was great. However, I felt like their was so much chili in the air - I couldn't stop coughing!

Bonus points to our cool Iranian Jewish waiter who was really sweet and funny.

I'd go back and try more things! 

Love you!
Muah!"}
{"text":"Definitely a must try in my book. I had the Yentafo (Pink noodle) that was on their menu cover. Best Thai noodle soup I've had in Pittsburgh. Soup was spot on to what I'm used to this did tasting like in California. I ate half of it and was way to full to keep going. If you're a meat lover this dish came packed with giant chunks of pork, amazing calamari and shrimp (and fish balls which I opted not to add). 

The Thai tea was one of the best I've tried. Sweet but not to sweet with a lot of flavor. 

My date ordered the Minced pork with Basil. At first he really liked it, but midway through he thought it was too salty. I personally thought it was great. But I only took one bite.

Food came out pretty quickly but I definitely think for a Saturday they should have two waiters. 

I deducted 1/2 a star because they still hadn't fixed the hood, so with the door closed it did get pretty smoky in there, but not sure why they didn't open the back door instead of the front door. And with the door open it was freezing cold. 

Also lost 1/2 a star because we ordered an appetizer that he forgot to put in the computer. We weren't upset b/c he seemed very busy being the only waiter on a weekend. Also, price point was a little high. One noodle, one rice, and one drink set us at $33.17 with tip we spent $40. I hope they can survive with so many other restaurants on the street. It would be a shame to lose this gem."}
{"text":"Sadly, this restaurant has closed.  Grubhub is reporting that it is gone.  Also, when I drove by today, the restaurant was locked up and the windows had paper on them.  I'm sad.  This was a very good restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is pretty awful.  Where to begin?

Ventilation.  We were first seated at a table that felt like it was in a wind tunnel.  I mentioned it to the \"maitre d' \" (which is far too elevated a term for this establishment) who responded that he needed to get the temperature way down or he'd have to open the door.  We asked to be reseated and fortunately the place was mostly empty so we were.  The new table was an improvement -- until the kitchen revved up.  Then the place became far smokier (and oilier) than any restaurant ought to be.

Food.  Mediocre at best.  The maitre d' (who doubled as a waiter) warned us that the food was very spicy-- 1 to 10 \"and that's Thai 1 to 10, not American.\"  So I ordered a 1.  Completely tasteless.  

Service.  The maitre d' was a clown and a compulsive talker.  If the atmosphere and the food hadn't already spoiled the dinner, he most certainly would have.

Considering how many Thai restaurants there are (some of which are within a stone's throw of this place) and some of which are pretty good or even excellent, this place is so low on the list that it's not worth patronizing.   I suspect it won't last very long -- and it shouldn't."}
{"text":"Second time here! I really like this place. There are so many options and each one has been really good.  It was raining out so they let us keep my dog inside the restaurant under our table.  Best thai iced tea in Pittsburgh for sure!!"}
{"text":"Pros: Great service, excellent Thai food

Cons: The air is so think with spice and smoke that indoor dining is difficult.

I see they are temporarily closed, hopefully to improve the ventilation.

I hope they will also consider changing the name, as \"outlet\" indirectly implies this is not top quality (even though the food quality is very good)."}
{"text":"I've been to Thailand and outside of that, this restaurant has been the most authentic, amazing Thai food I've come across.

We had chicken satay for appetizer which was ridiculous. I followed that with the peanut pad Thai which was analogous to a religious experience - surreal. The gf had cashew chicken which was incredible. 

To cap the gluttony, we ended with mango sticky rice. Authentic and spot on. 

It's a shame this place opened a month ago and we're moving in a month. Amazing place."}
{"text":"I ordered a ton yum soup which was extremely sweet and salty, not as I expected what Tom yum soup would be..... the fried rice was alright though..."}
{"text":"Was here a couple of times for take out.  So far everything has been great.  Highly recommend their Som Tum and Yen Ta Fo.  The Som Tum really did taste like I was having it out of a street outlet in a Thai night market.  Yen Ta Fo was fragrant and brimmed with many different types of proteins and veggies.  There were some exotic ingredients too like cow liver and tripe, as far as I can tell, which IMO added to the flavor and texture but if you are not into those I guess you can ask them to be taken out.  More common selections like Pad Thai and Pad See-Ew are also very good, although the Pad Thai is a little bit on the sweeter side.  Personally liked the Pad See-Ew better.  Perfect balance and flat rice noodles were springy (not mushy) like they should be.  Some day I'll sit down here.  There is an interesting gentleman from the UK manning the tables who has promised to tell me a story once I do."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite Thai place in Squirrel Hill!  Service is fast, friendly, and very informative. The older gentlemen who helped us gave us recommendations, and seemed to really love the food they serve there. 

Food quality was very good!  The sever warned us about their authentic spiciness levels from 1-10, so whatever I get at a Thai place that does American spice levels, I should order two down. Well, I heeded his warning and where I normally get a 5 other places, at this place I choose 3. I can take my food pretty spicy, so if you don't like your mouth consistently burning, heed his warning!  They're not joking!
My friend thought he'd ignore the warning and got a dish of the chefs special pink noodle shrimp, and asked for it a spiciness of 6, which was toooo hot for him. 

The pork pad see ew is a winner and a go to of mine. This one had the biggest chunks of pork I'd ever seen come in this dish!  I saw a girl order the pad Thai, and it was HUGE! Good portions here. My partner got green curry with chicken, which was pretty good but needed more veggies in it to go along with the lots of chicken. Very tasty. 
Their Thai iced tea was good but very sweet. Only $2, which is the cheapest anywhere in Pittsburgh. 
Their Thai iced coffee was too sweet, couldn't taste any coffee and is served just like the iced Thai teas are.  Again, $2, good price. 

A lot of dishes are $11-12, chef specials are $14-17, and there are up-charges depending if you get a more expensive meat / protein option. 

Parking on Murray is street parking you have to pay for, and it can sometimes be hard to find a spot right out front, but it's an easy walk from any direction, once you do."}
{"text":"Look I've only been here once but do not sleep on this spot!!! Easily the best wonton soup I've ever had... it puts almost every place to shame. The Pad Thai with chicken was easily the best in PGH area. I can't wait to try the rest of this delicious menu. 

Place is a bit tight but decent ambience. No corridor so it is directly exposed to people coming in and going out... so can be a little drafty. Wait Service was both friendly and attractive. I will likely be a regular."}
{"text":"This place is pretty awful.  Where to begin?

{"text":"Popped in one day after Hot Yoga with a few friends. Great neat and simple setting with a variety of options on the menu.

I had a pork dish with just the right amount of spice and freshness. Took half home so the portions are fair. The prices are right here!

Excellent service! 

Worth the stop in or takeout.  Will be back!"}
{"text":"Stopped by and wasn't sure if this was simply a remake of the prior restaurant or not. The  inside looks similar but menu was different. Anyway the owner? Came by and chatted with me, very nice guy. Food was fantastic. Best Thai I've had in squirrel hill. Quick courteous service. Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"I was soooo excited to find out they have the same owners as my other favorite Thai restaurant in mount Lebanon! The food here is amazing!! My go to is always the crab Rangoon appetizer, chicken cashew nut noodles and Thai ice coffee . Just a tip the spice levels are very authentic, even a 4 is very spicy for me and I can tolerate the heat. The only downside to having this place open up so close to me is I will have to visit it on a weekly basis!"}
{"text":"Definitely different than the restaurant that was there before. The menu choices were more limiting. The wait staff was very good. Flavors were good. But, that's it. Just good, not wow, not hmm, just good. With all the Thai choices, a new place needs to knock my socks off. They were very accommodating when the spice was to much on a friend's dish. Feel free to try it and offer your opinions. I was underwhelmed."}
{"text":"This is honestly the best Thai I've had in Pittsburgh. Apparently, the owner of this place also owns Thai Cottage over in Regent Square.

The food. For both dishes we got a spice level of 7. Compared to other restaurants where I've ordered a 7, this is definitely spicier... so stray on the side of caution if you can't handle spice. 

We got the minced pork basil on the chef special list. For reference, I'm pretty sure this is called pad ka prao in Thai. The pork had a perfect balance of 3/4 lean pork and 1/4 fatty pork. I looked up a recipe for it to make at home because it was that good. It is kind of expensive for the ingredients they use in the dish though ($15 for minced pork, basil and an egg). 

We also got the thai pho soup with beef. This was also great. The noodles aren't your typical pho noodles. They were thin rice/vermicelli like noodles and absorbed the flavor of the broth really well. The broth was spicy, sweet and sour. The meatballs tasted like those beef tendon meatballs you put in hot pot (mmm) and the beef was tender.

We went on a packed Friday night around 7:30, and there was only one server, one expo and no hostess. I understand that the place is rather small, but they seemed a little overwhelmed. The service was still quick, and their staff was amicable. 

**When we were there, it seems as though their ventilation wasn't top notch. Anytime anyone got a really spicy dish, the whole dining area would fill with deathly spice fumes causing everyone to cough. Maybe more than a curtain between the kitchen and dining room would be a good idea.**"}
{"text":"I am a thai American and have been to Thailand and hundreds of thai restaurants in my life. I eat at thai restaurants almost everyday. Food was OK. Told us how it's soo spicy and it's like Thailand spicy levels but it was not spicy at all. They make up their own dishes that aren't thai. The service was awful the waiter peeked at our tips and though my friend tipped 18% got angry and said we didn't tip him enough and raised his voice at us. It was very in comfortable. I would not go here again."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, I was very disappointed by this dining experience. I am a big believer that dining is only partly about the food you are eating and is also highly influenced by your environment; and the environment here ruined our meal. A couple minutes into our dining experience all of the customers started coughing because something was severely wrong with their exhaust system. Every time you breathed it felt like a mixture of smoke and horrible spices were filling your lungs. I honestly felt like I was choking for most of the time there. At one point it was pretty comical because all of the women just kept looking at each other in the dining room while everyone was choking. 

All of that being said I really hope this was a fluke experience. The waitstaff there were really nice and in theory the environment could be nice minus the air problems. 

Now to discuss the food. We started with spring rolls which were really fresh; except there should have been more sauce on the side. I had the Pad Thai which was really scrumptious and a generous portion. They claim to be very authentic Thai food. So essentially that means that a 1 level spice there is actually a 3 or 4 somewhere else. 

To sum this all up, I don't plan to dine in here again, but I will definitely order take out."}
{"text":"Affordable, delicious, and large portions! Yum!
I've been working my way through the chef specials every time I come back. Everything is so good. This restaurant rises above the monotony of all the other Thai joints in Pittsburgh. It's refreshing to have a new place that puts a spin on the usual dishes while also adding something new to the mix."}
{"text":"Ordered take-out tonight - spring rolls, fresh rolls, beef with broccoli, and green curry with broccoli. The rolls were good, nothing extraordinary, just what you'd expect. The entrees however were outstanding. The green curry was delicious (my favorite green curry is pusadee's garden) and this was a little better. Definitely far better than Bangkok balcony's. The vegetables were nice and crispy and the biggest surprise was the beef, really tasty and good quality. Same to be said for beef with broccoli. Can't wait to try all the other dishes here, this will be my go-to Thai place to pick up."}
{"text":"Finally, a decent Pad Thai in Squirrel Hill!  This place replaces a different Thai place that I gave poor reviews to, so I am glad to see that it is much improved over the new ownership.  The food was delicious and plentiful.   A tad more pricey that I would have expected with the protein charge; but it was two meals for me, so it evens out a bit.  We were warned by the server that the spice levels are authentic and he said he puts in one level lower as a rule.  I thought mine was good as served, but probably could have gone to the level I asked for.   The mango sticky rice is a favorite for me, so I was glad to see it on the menu.   

Four stars instead of five because the space could still use some work.  Gone is the smelly carpet and old feel; however, it was so HOT in there that I was sweating before I even sat down.  It was also really loud, which made conversation difficult.  They need some ventilation and AC in there for sure - I'll stick to takeout in the meantime."}
{"text":"We came here on a Wednesday night for dinner and it wasn't really crowded so we were seated right away. The waiter was really friendly and attentive which is the reason why I gave it more stars. The food on the other hand wasn't as great. We had ordered spring rolls, duck soup and pad see ew. The spring rolls arrived first - it was good that the noodles inside were still warm but I didn't like it much as it didn't have any meat (we knew this when ordering). The duck soup was dry and barely had any broth, I also was not a big fan of the flavor. My pad see ew was ok but the chicken was really dry which made it hard to eat. Overall, I've been to better thai places. The price that they charge you for the quality of food is not really worth it."}
{"text":"Best thai in sq hill and one of the best in the city. We had the kao soy, dumplings, bbq pork and spicy fried rice. Everything tasted super fresh and delicious. Service was friendly and attentive. This is our new thai joint in the neighborhood! Cant wait to try some other dishes."}
{"text":"Really nice owner but not impressed with the food, which we waited a long time for, despite a nearly empty restaurant. The tom ka gai soup lacked depth of flavor - couldn't taste any lemongrass and the coconut was bland. The kids liked the deep fried dumplings but the pad Thai and pad see ew were unimpressive. Everyone who used the restroom downstairs referred to it as \"the dungeon\" and I found out why when it was my turn. The walk-ins and food storage were also located in the basement. It was a little weird having the cook walk through the dining room to the basement to get food items. I'd like to see this place do well, but they need to amp up the flavor and use fresher ingredients."}
{"text":"One of the best cashew nut chicken dinners, ever.  Great sauce, ample chicken.
The pad Thai was good, not great.
Staff was very friendly, laughing and positive."}
{"text":"Oh my!!  I get to eat Pink Noodle at this small but pack of flavor restaurant.  It's like back at home in Thailand.  Amazing food, clean and fast."}
{"text":"This is an improvement over the old Sukhothai (and certainly the other Thai places in Squirrel Hill) for several reasons. First we appreciate that the tables have their own mini sauce / condiment bar of various vinegars and chili pastes, which allow customers to customize dishes to their liking. Second, their focus on noodles allows them to serve a number of items that are not always found in the typical Thai restaurant, but at the same time they also have enough non-noodle dishes to satisfy any craving. 

So far we've sampled a few dry and soup noodle dishes. The dry dishes are quite good--in terms of taste, preparation, and ingredients they compare to what you can get at some of the better Thai restaurants in the city. The sukiyaki noodles were interesting since I'm not sure that it's available elsewhere. Good mix of glass noodles, vegetables, and meat, all with a very tasty sauce. But the noodle soups seemed to be where they excelled. While we have only tried the boat and sukhothai noodles, we found both to be very savory and satisfying. The broths had lots of flavor, the noodles were done perfectly, and there ample amounts of tender meat and vegetables. Definitely go for the soups for something different from what you'd normally get at other places.

I do wish that they have the noodle soups for lunch portions, and you might want to be wary of the ventilation there--the smells of the different dishes can be quite strong and often waft all the way to the door! Waiter service was very friendly."}
{"text":"Best Thai in town:). Reminds me of when I was in a small eatery in Rayong- the smells of chili oil permeates the air, but not overbearing.  Clearly, the owner knew how to make use of each ingredient. The kee mao was extraordinary, making ample use of fresh green peppers, and hints of basil throughout.  The dumplings were tender but not mushy,  with a flavor that was easy on the palate.

I don't know what happened with the previous place, but I can assure everyone that this place will easily overcome the restaurant across the street as squirrel hill's best authentic Thai food :)"}
{"text":"Lunch is about $10, whereas dinner can be $15-$20.

Red curry was good. Chicken was cheaper and beef/shrimp was like +$4. Boat noodle was also good too. So is the pink noodle shrimp, lots of shrimp in that one. 

The only disappointment was firecreaker chicken.  It was dry and not as good as the others we tried. 

The place is rather small and true that the air is thick with spice (and hot).  Perhaps winter time will make it easier."}
{"text":"Had a really tasty meal over the weekend here along with some great service. We went with the green curry with tofu and red curry noodle dish. Both were piping hot, delicious and fresh. The servings are good sized too. Would definitely go back. Bathroom was down a narrow stairway so not sure how accessible it is to folks with disabilities."}
{"text":"The generic name should have been the giveaway.  Food just isn't that great here.  Maybe it's just me being tired of Thai in general, but all four dishes were dry and lacked distinctive enough flavors.  Pad Thai especially was dry as a bone.  Pad see you was not as dry but needed more veggies.  Portions big.  Veg spring rolls were decent.  I wouldn't order again from here when there are other Thai options close by."}
{"text":"In my quest for the best pad thai in Squirrel Hill, I finally got around to trying it here. 

It was a larger portion that at least two of the other places nearby. And it was a fair price at $12 including the chicken. 

I also got the sweet sticky rice. But, I wouldn't actually recommend either dishes here. The pad thai was good but at least two of the other nearby locations were better. The sticky rice was microwaved with sticky sauce ladled on afterward. 

If this were the only option I would probably come again, but with the number of options in the area it's at the bottom of the list. 

The staff was extremely friendly however, which goes such a long way to making a place fun to go to. So I want to leave this review on a positive note because of that!"}
{"text":"I stopped by here earlier today with my wife for lunch.  Even though Thai & Noodle Outlet wasn't supposed to be open until noon we saw an open sign on the sidewalk and snuck in a few minutes beforehand.  The inside of the restaurant feels nice and clean with hardwood floors and pink and brown walls.  There is seating for 32 (6 - 4 tops and 4 - 2 tops) and some paintings decorate the walls.  Our hostess/server was bubbly and very nice which made us feel very welcomed.

For lunch on this day I decided to go with the Sukthothai soup, spice level 9.  The menu described the dish as Sukhothai broth with minced pork, roasted pork, peanuts, bean sprouts, scallions, cilantro, fried garlic, and crispy wontons.  Just in case I needed it spicier, they had a tray of three different spices on the table, salt, dried red pepper and a liquid one which I didn't recognize as well as some fish sauce. Whenever the dish came to the table I was pretty excited about it.  I first tried some of the roasted pork and my eyes started to water due to the spice.  However once I mixed it up the spice level of the dish became perfect as it was spicy enough to make me feel/taste it but not overwhelmingly so.  The broth here was fantastic too as it's depth of flavor brought some sweetness, sourness and spiciness which paired nicely with the peanuts.  Actually everything in the dish was quite flavorful and I was impressed with the amount of food as there was an almost ridiculous amount of noodles.  This meant that I actually had trouble finishing it and was absolutely stuffed by the end of my meal.  

The bottom line for me is that I would head back here again in the future.  Both my wife and I absolutely loved our food and thought \"it hit the spot\" and our hostess/server was really nice too!"}
{"text":"Listen, I know, there are plenty of Thai and Asian fusion restaurants to choose from in Squirrel Hill and they seem to come and go.  But Thai & Noodle Outlet needs to stay and you need to eat there!
Located on Forbes Avenue next to the Carnegie Library this small, pleasant space seats probably about 25 people and is BYOB.  Service is fast and very friendly and I have a feeling you could have a nice date here or enjoy an evening with friends.
My group of three started out sharing the appetizer Tofu Paradise.  And, you know what, as far as tofu goes, it was its own little paradise!  This is a great app to share and the tofu was fried lightly with no grease or oil to be seen and topped with a tasty peanut sauce.  Personally, I think it could have used a little more sauce, but it was likely the perfect amount. 
For my entree I had the pad cashew nuts noodles.  It had a great heat to it and the noodles were a perfect flatness seasoned well and accompanied by fresh vegetables.  I ate every last bite.
My friends also enjoyed their meals - we all agreed that it was spicy but not in a  \"HELP my mouth is on fire!\" way.  The price was reasonable and seriously, the service could not have been better.  I can't wait to return."}
{"text":"While the main server has proclaimed to us that this is the best Thai restaurant in Pittsburgh, it definitely lives up to the largely bold claim. I've tried the Pineapple Fried Rice, along with Pad Thai and a fusion dish with Spaghetti noodles. Please be careful about the spice; they're right about it far surpassing any assumptions. However, the dishes are extremely well seasoned and incredibly balanced - the spice adds an intense amount of flavor. Will definitely be back here more than once"}
{"text":"** Small restaurant in Squirrel Hill with a large menu, but seemingly mediocre dishes. Service definitely on the slower end even though its not super busy.

I came here with a group of friends after originally wanting to go to Everyday Noodles, but the Friday night crowd was just too hard to beat so we ended up being diverted to this spot. A lot of times I have walked by this place, I haven't seen too many people inside and personally don't know anyone who has been here but I decided to give it a shot because i was craving noodles and the menu seemed reasonably cheap.

I ordered the Nam Sai noodle soup with Chicken, and I have to say that this was one of the plainest noodle soups I have ever had. The portion was decent for its price ($11) so I'll give them that. However, this dish also took a long time to come out, and I was definitely getting a bit hangry. Another one of my friends ordered the Pad See Yew, which he just said was OK."}
{"text":"3.5 stars.

There's a lot of Thai food in squirrel hill, and Thai & Noodle fits straight in.

The place is pretty small, but it's not a bad vibe. The food options are pretty much standard, except they also have soup noodles, which I didn't get to try yet.

I started with the chicken satay, and enjoyed that a lot. The peanut sauce is an excellent compliment to the juicy chicken they cook.

Their pad Thai was alright. I thought the noodles were stuck too much together, which was more like goo than noodles. The tangy citrus of good pad Thai wasn't there either, and it also wasn't that spicy. The chicken was really well done though, so I was glad with that.

I do want to try some of their other menu options, but not a bad first impression of a small Thai shop."}
{"text":"I stopped by here for takeout and had a fantastic experience. The person working there who took my order was extremely friendly and courteous and my food came out in about 10 minutes just as he indicated. I ordered the steamed pork dumplings as an appetizer which came out warm and fresh and were delicious (see photo). I also ordered the sukiyaki which I was excited to see on the menu since I haven't seen it elsewhere in Pittsburgh. I was able to select my spiciness level 1-10 and the portions were generous. Although the name suggests a Thai restaurant it is really a fusion place with a focus on noodle and soup dishes. There are a nice variety of options and the inking area looks bright, clean and comfortable. I'll definitely come back here again."}
{"text":"From the sign outside, this place doesn't seem too high quality at first glance. However the food itself is decently priced and fairly large in portion. I ordered the pork see ew 0 spice level and my friend got the chicken pad Thai 3 spice level. We also had the chicken satay and some Thai iced tea and Thai iced coffee. I'd say the most outstanding part of the meal were the drinks. They were sweet and satisfactory and only $2! 

We ordered takeout and the satay looked a bit suspicious since it seemed small being concealed in an aluminum foil wrap. Unwrapping it revealed a few chicken skewers to pair with the two sauces in the box. The pad Thai actually had a lingering spice at spice level 3. So if you're someone who can't take spice, my advice is to stick to a 0. I do wish there were more veggies and meat in the noodle dishes. They seemed to be mostly comprised of just noodles and grease.

Overall, I wasn't impressed but I wasn't disappointed or put off in any way. Just an average Thai joint."}
{"text":"Without a doubt the best and most authentic Thai food in Pittsburgh. Hands down the best I've had outside of Thailand. 

Don't let the name or signage throw you off, this place is a Gem in plain sight with a title that almost turns you away- Don't let it, you'd be missing out. The spice smacks you in the face as soon as you walk in, you'll cough or sneeze but you'll acclimate just fine and after your meal, you'll feel that you should open the door to the 80+ degree Thai weather outside. 

I recently visited Thailand and since have yearned for a less westernized version of Thai food here at home. This place has it. The key indications of authenticity were presented moment by moment from the second I stepped in the door. The spice in the air, the picture of the King, the essential condiments at every table, the strong smell of Kapi(fermented shrimp paste) as soon as your dish hits the table, the proper sticky level of the rice,  the higher spice levels- This place is a piece of Thailand in Pittsburgh. 

Albeit, it is a wee pricey(dinner prices + Protein) for Pittsburgh standards, the portions are almost certain to leave you with leftovers and a smile on your face- Plus they use all the right ingredients, no BS here.The presentation is lackluster, but who cares if it tastes good. Service is friendly, fast and informative. I recommend the mango curry. It is cooked with the under-ripe mangos so it isn't over sweet; AKA it is done right and mouthwateringly delicious.  

I will be back so many more times."}
{"text":"We had high expectations for this restaurant since there are many excellent Thai restaurants in Pittsburgh. The atmosphere overall was small but bright and family-friendly: 4/5. The service was pretty good 4/5, constant water refills. 
Finally, the food. We ordered a see-yew (spice level 3), pad thai (spice level 0), and pad peanut sauce (spice level 5). The spice level is out of 10 and is very spicy; the pad peanut sauce at 5 was overwhelming but still edible. Everything was also too sweet to be authentic. The pad thai we ordered was too sweet that it became inedible after a couple of bites. 
The food here wasn't very special taste-wise, just too sweet to our standards. They do, however, have a large variety of food entrees ranging from rice, curry, and noodles.

atmosphere 4/5
service 4/5

{"text":"We went on Sunday for late lunch.  Wonderful service....we had the Pink noodle shrimp, Kao Soi and Dumplings.  The server warned us that the spice level is higher than most restaurants.  I usually get an 8...  a 6 was perfect.  My hubby went down a level as well and it was perfect.  Our server was very friendly and paced our orders with  the kitchen so our food came out hot and fresh.  Would give 5 stars except that there is a ventilation issue.  It is a small place so when the kitchen is hopping, the smoke filters into the dining area.  Fans and an open door helped.  We will definitely go back and hope for some outside seating or takeout and head to Shelley Park to eat outside."}
{"text":"The service here is always fast and pleasant and the food is mostly consistent. If I had to air one complaint, it'd be that I can't consistently get them to make it spicy enough. I don't believe a 10 is really a 10."}
{"text":"Pretty pumped about the whole thing. Had pad Thai  and a Thai iced tea delivered. Deliver took an appropriate amount of time. Thai tea was on point.  Pad Thai was not the best I've ever had, but for the competitive price I was pleased with it.  I would have like the option on the delivery to increase the spicy ness level but it's all good.  I really liked the miso type soup that came with it.  Very yummy.  Over all I'd order it again!"}
{"text":"Ordered lunch Pad Thai for take-out. Not horrible, and actually an improvement over the previous restaurant, but really not good. I did like that they used the thinner ricer noodles, and they weren't too dry.  It was a bit sweet for my taste and had an aftertaste of ketchup.  Also the chicken was mostly dry and some pieces were so chewy that I spit them out.  It came with a soup that tasted of chicken powder.  Also, when I went in, it was as if the kitchen fans were blowing hot smoky air around the restaurant and nobody turned on the ventilation hoods. May consider giving them another try, but was mostly unimpressed."}
{"text":"I saw this place opened recently so I wanted to give it a try. 

We got take out of the Panang curry. It comes with rice but I was splitting it with someone so we ordered an extra. This was for dinner so the total price came out to be $16--I thought this was a lot for the amount of curry given.

We came in at an off hour, so there wasn't anyone there, but the place was very clean, had sauces on each table, and the staff was very friendly! Service was quick as well 

We got the curry at a level 6/10 spicy. I was nervous at first because I wasn't sure if their level 6 was actually spicy but they delivered! It was a nice change because a lot of places don't deliver on the spice, but this was great! I would only recommend getting above a 5 if you are more used to eating spicy food because they actually do a very good job of making it spicy. The only thing about the panang was for an entree, I wish it had more meat and vegetables and tasted more nut-ier like panang usually does. 

I would still come back to try their different foods, since we only got one thing on the menu but definitely come try this place out."}
{"text":"Ordered takeout.  Food was okay.  Plenty of other thai options in Squirrel Hill, so probably not my first choice in the future."}
{"text":"Just opened recently. Looks nice from the outside. A new good place to try Thai food, especially Thai curry."}
{"text":"Lunch today, I had green curry, spice level 7. It wasn't as spicy as I wanted but it was ok. The curry was somewhat thin, the green beans were crunchy and good, but there were no other veggies. Lunch price was $9.00."}
{"text":"The best Thai restaurant in squirrel hill in my opinion. I was skeptical at first but this place did not disappoint! The menu has good options but I would recommend the kao soy. It was really tasty and very filling. They ask you what spice level you want from 1-10 and I chose a 6 because I like spicy and can handle a good amount, I can't handle a high amount. But spiciness is subjective. This place is definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"I ordered the pad thai from here and it was OK. It was a large portion for the price I paid, but I have had better. It was kind of dry and not extremely flavorful but I still enjoyed it."}
{"text":"I ate here for the first time yesterday. I have to say it was fantastic. I ordered the Green Curry Noodles and I highly recommend. The service was also great, very friendly and fast."}
{"text":"I am Thai and this is one of my fav Thai restaurants in town! Try the Yen Ta Pho, if you like noodles."}
