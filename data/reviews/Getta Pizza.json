{"text":"Well we have been ordering from here for the past 3 years although the pizza is good there service sure lacks. I was very disappointed tonight as we usually order thru them 2 or 3 times a month. Tonight I decided to try there pasta special however I still ordered the 2 large pizzas as usual. Normally I have it delivered to us and I tip from 8 to 10 dollars. Tonight the guy told me sorry you will have to pay regular price for the pasta if I did not pick it up. Now I can see this if I was not paying the regular 40 something for the pizza on top of that.  I will have it delivered from now on and save my tip of 8 to 10 dollars each time.  Customer loyalty means nothing to them yes it was only a couple of dollars but the point is I was still ordering regular priced pizza. Well tip money saved a month means an extra pizza to me."}
{"text":"Nice and convenient to grab a slice to go. 
Service is great, the young guys who are always working are friendly and fast.  
Not very big if you want to stay and have a bite with friends or family best to order in. 

Overall great little pizza place!"}

{"text":"A hidden gem! We have ordered pizza here a few times now and it has not let us down. It has the right amount of toppings and cheese and not greasy! 
The only thing we did not like were the wings as they were not crispy, but don't let that stop you from ordering here. 
The price is great for what you get! Again, great place to order from in the SW."}
{"text":"The on the go slices have to be the best I've had ever.  Absolutely ordering pizza here for my bachellorette party because they also do gluten-free!"}
{"text":"Fantastic pizza!!!!  Hadn't had their pizza before tonight and will definitely be back.  The meat lovers was the best of the two choices!!!!  Thank you!!!"}
