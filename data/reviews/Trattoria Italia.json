{"text":"Excellent food. Congenial owners. Pasta fagioli to die for. Definitely will come back soon."}
{"text":"The food so far has been delish. Good friends good food. As far as service it's fine, food is awesome. But the company is better."}
{"text":"Excellent family-run Italian restaurant. Off-strip and totally worth the short drive. Salads were fresh, tasty, and big enough to share. Pasta dishes, sandwiches, and chicken parm were all very good, and fed a hungry family after some long hikes in Zion National Park.   We're glad to have found Trattoria Italia, and we'll certainly be back. Recommended!"}
{"text":"Dinner was great again and our service was terrific.  Shared a bottle of wine and too many rolls (soooo good).  I had Pasta E Fagioli soup and linguini pesto and BH had Vodka sauce over gluten free pasta and a lovely serving of broccoli.  Our go to Italian restaurant.  :)"}
{"text":"Enjoyed this place very much. My family is from Sicily and it is hard to find the really stuff. Well this place has the really stuff. Food was good they have Italian cookies, pastries, and the best cannoli you could have. You need to try this place. I will be back again. Loved the Italian music also"}
{"text":"Great traditional pasta. Best spot I have been to since eating pasta in Italy. Would go there again and again. This is a family owned restaurant and service is always great."}
{"text":"Came for dinner while staying nearby.....   great!!    Bread knots, insalata salad, meatballs, lasagna & bolognese --- all 5 stars  The pastries were fantastic as well.  Anytime we are anywhere close we will be coming back."}
{"text":"You must get the cannoli's, best I've ever had! Everything was delicious!!! It'll be our go to Italian spot in town!"}
{"text":"Much love to Pasquale and Dion, not only was the food amazing!!  but its so nice to have that extra personal touch where your treated like family.  Salute!!! To my now new favorite place! All I can say is...DELIZIOSO!!! Mangia! GRAZIE :))) Danielle~"}
{"text":"This is a long-awaited welcome addition to SE Las Vegas for authentic Italian food made by real Italians. They've included a few dishes for the American sensibility of Italian food but the pasta is perfect and made in house. The wines on offer show informed, simple and deft but yet confident selections all while still accessible to the novice.  Return patron again and again."}
{"text":"Love this place. I was in town visiting family and I asked them to recommend something local, unique (no chain restaurants, off the strip).  This place fit the bill.  We were seated right away and the service was outstanding throughout the meal. Atmosphere is very comfortable (except I agree with the other Yelp review about the poor choice of \"background\" music).   Arancini, caprese, pappardelle gamberi, spaghetti & meatballs were all excellent, but a bit overpriced so I can't give it 5 stars.  I can't wait to come back and try some of my other favorites (lobster ravioli, chicken marsala) so please don't take those off the menu!"}
{"text":"Reasonably priced for great food. Great atmosphere, besides soccer playing on tv in background."}
{"text":"Beautiful Food Beautiful Wine and Beautiful Experience. I love this place 5 stars all the way"}
{"text":"Amazing authentic Italian food!! Excellent service! The sauce is amazing. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"We came in quite late on a Saturday after a day in the hot Las Vegas sun - 30 minutes before closing.  The staff made us feel right at home, regardless, even delivering an amazing desert and singing happy birthday to our teenage daughter.  The waitress was kind and understanding of our picky eater, vegan, and mom with seafood, nut, and dairy allergies.  We felt safe and understood.  The even have gluten-free options!!! We highly recommend."}
{"text":"MAMMA MIA CHE BUONA  !         Stopped here for the first time tonight to pick up a \"To Go Order\" of Eggplant Parmigiana.I'm Italian and I know what good Eggplant Parmigiana  tastes like. This is the real deal. Eggplant assembled just right with a generous topping of mozzarella highlighted with what could be my grandmother's sauce. The order also came with several very tasty garlic knots.         In addition, the owner and his wife were extremely friendly and efficient.         I will be back with the family next time for a sit down dinner."}
{"text":"Love this place!!! They have the best authentic Italian food. Very nice, clean, fast service, and great prices. MILENA was very attentive and helpful and even made a special dish for me."}
{"text":"Fantastic restaurant; family owned, all home cooked from scratch, reasonably priced, wonderful atmosphere, great wines and fantastic service Great for a romantic dinner or large party. Private party rooms opening soon. Stop in and have a great conversation with the owners or enjoy your privacy. Try the pizza or a meal it all is delicious. You will not be let down. Give the owners feedback if you are not thrilled with your meal and they will make you happy. Great place to go if you want something off strip with excellent food."}
{"text":"My husband and I went there on a Saturday for our anniversary.  We were seated quite promptly even though a large party of 20 or so had just come in for a birthday.  In the past we have ordered from here from delivery services and the food is always good.   This was the first time for us to sit down and eat at the place.  Service was great from the hostess, to our waitress Jill.  We were always checked on by all of the staff.  Our water and pops never went empty.  We were very impressed by the staff especially being former food and beverage people.   Hubby had fettuccine Bolognese and I had the canneloni.  We brought home fettuccine Alfredo for our son.  We also had the mozzarella balls for appetizer.  Everything was really good and the portions are huge! Their regular marinara sauce is delicious,  not over nor under seasoned.  The olive oil dip they bring with bread is super delicious, I think with herbs in it.  It's a nice casual family friendly place.  I will definitely bring my friends and family when they come to visit.  You can go dressed up or in jeans and a t-shirt.   To top it all off, it is very affordable.  Especially when you consider the portion sizes.  We had an appetizer, 3 entrees, 2 pops, a nice glass of pinot noir for under 80 bucks.  I knew I loved their food, now I know I love the place itself!"}
{"text":"I work at a upscale Italian restaurant at the Venetian and have been looking for closer Italian food, hopefully for cheaper, with similar taste and quality. Not anything like Olive Garden or Carrabas- ew. I just saw this place on my drive home, stopped and ordered a spaghetti amatriciana Togo. Still as hot as if it just left the kitchen, I'm eating this now at my house (10 mins after picking it up) and it is JUST what I was looking for. This is a fantastic dish. Delicious, hot, fresh, worth the price. I dare say it equals the $30 spaghetti amatriciana at my work. The garlic knots weren't anything spectacular but it's a free addition so who cares. I'm so happy I found this and can't wait to try everything else on the menu!"}
{"text":"Stopped in while my phone was being worked on at Sprint. The pastry case is amazing, the insalata italia was so delicious and the minestrone was home made and one of the best I have tasted.    Visiting was a complete accident, but the return will not be."}
{"text":"The food is great!  Traditional Italian cooking.  Eggplant parmigiana is delicious.  Meatballs are like my nonna used to make.  The owners are from Palermo, Sicily and add that friendly, Italian touch to the excellent service.  They were so patient with me as I practiced my long-forgotten Italian  language with them!  It's a comfortable, very clean, relaxed atmosphere.  This was our first visit, but it has now become our go-to place for Italian cooking."}
{"text":"Ordered online through Grubhub for delivery.  Ordered eggplant parmigiana with sauce on side.  Received order with no sauce at all.  Also ordered linguine with clam sauce .  All the clam shells were broken and I was picking out sharp pieces while trying to chew. Called owner and he was rude.  Said you want sauce you come get.  This place is recently opened and we won't be ordering again."}
{"text":"We got a pepperoni pizza about two months ago. It was doughy in the middle. I understand that the pepperoni tends to be greasy but it wasn't that, it was doughy. So, a few weeks ago we decided to try it again because the taste was very good. When I called to order I let the guy know the last one was doughy, and he said \"so you would like your pizza\"......paused...so I said \"cooked\". Got there to pick it up and was told it was still in the oven because I wanted it well done. Got home and looked more cooked around the edges but the dough in the middle was a soggy mess and disintegrated. It was a mess but again, the flavor was good. Really wish they would figure out the dough issue."}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  Food & Service top class.   Must go place .... reasonable priced, big quantities & good friendly staff  Will have to come back  to try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Awesome service. Fantastic bottle of wine. The bread they bring was warm and delicious. We will be back"}
{"text":"Went for a late lunch and had Eggplant parm is good, I also had a side salad. The server was very kind."}
{"text":"Great find... one of my good friends took me here... food was outstanding with reasonable prices and portions.  Chianti was excellent and fairly priced.  Definitely going to be one of my go to places from now on!"}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed. I ordered pizza here today at 11:30am and it was incredible. I told my wife about the experience and she wanted to try it! I ended up coming back here at 9pm excited to have it again, but as soon as I opened the box up I knew something was off. The fact that it was over cooked wasn't even my biggest issue. It's almost as if it was a completely different pizza. The cheese had that cheap pizza cheese taste to it. I don't know if it was that I came in an hour before closing and  they just threw something together but this definitely wasn't the same pizza I had here earlier in the day"}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of dining here for a luncheon through Chicagoans In The Desert.  I was very impressed!  As an Italian, I can be rather critical of any Italian food I am presented with, but I can say I enjoyed my meal very much.  I enjoyed their tortellini soup, shared some of my friends salad which was beyond generous in portion and had all the good stuff in it - fresh mozzarella balls, olives, artichokes, etc., and I opted to have the spaghetti and meatballs for my entree.  Let me just say....their meatballs are FANTASTIC!  I thought the gravy (yes I said GRAVY) could have had a little more \"oomph\", but oh em gee those meatballs!  They they provided us with platters of cookies on the table...not a single one disappointed!  The staff worked very hard to please all us women, and the place is clean and comfortable.  My biggest disappointment about my visit was I forgot my leftovers!  I wouldn't hesitate to come back to this restaurant!"}
{"text":"I wish 10 stars was an option to leave for this little gem.  This is one of the best Italian meals that my husband and I have had in a long time.  We have been searching the city for a good Italian restaurant that has eat-in and take-out service and we just hit the jackpot.  The food is spectacular.  We wanted take-out this evening so this was a perfect test to see how good the food was and how well it would hold up for a short drive home.  We started off with the arancini.  One order included 4 enormous, freshly made arancini.  These were the best I ever had.  The order came with a side of sauce.  This was a zesty, home-made sauce, not the sweet stuff that passes for sauce in most Vegas restaurants.  Next, we split a Caesar salad.  The salad was large enough for two.  It was cold, crisp and fresh as a salad should be served.  We both opted for the chicken parmesan this evening.  The chicken parmesan comes with a side of angel hair pasta.  The chicken breast was enormous and so was the portion of pasta.  The chicken was cooked perfectly.  It was juicy and tender, while the breading was crisp.  The pasta was perfectly al dente.  Again, the chicken parm and the pasta was served with a homemade zesty (not sweet) sauce that we have been craving.  This main course also comes with a side of homemade knots.  They were tender and perfectly chewy.  I assume that these are made from their pizza dough as I also make my knots from my homemade pizza dough.  We finished off this perfect dinner with their homemade cheese cake and chocolate cheese cake.  Again, true perfection.  The cakes were not overly sweet but still rich and decadent.  Also of note, when they packed our meals to go they made sure to pack all the hot food in one bag and all the cold food in another.  I cannot tell you how many times we have gotten take-out and other restaurants have put a hot entrée on top of a cold salad or on top of a cold desert.  We have found our new go to for perfect Italian!"}
{"text":"I had been to this place last year and loved it. Went back recently to find they had expanded. Service was fantastic and food was magnificent. True authentic Italian food that took me back to holidays in Italy as a kid. Can't recommend it highly enough."}
{"text":"My husband and I really wanted to like this place. We were previously pretty dedicated to Montesano's as our regular pizza place and, like apparently a lot of people, desperate to find a suitable replacement -- that it would be located in the exact same space would just be a convenient bonus.   Unfortunately, the search continues. :-/  We did a large half cheese/half pepperoni, it was just over $16 (there's a $1 charge for take out, apparently, which is...fine ¯\_(?)_/¯) and it was incredibly mediocre. I think the photo kind of speaks for itself, but it was basically the taste/look of a pizza they'd serve in a high school cafeteria. It definitely is pizza, but it's not really what you wanted.   (It's about the same level of fulfillment as Blaze, just down the street, in my opinion. Definitely not the  new regular spot I was so ardently hoping for.)  The guy that answered the phone was super nice and the staff inside was nice, and it's possible that their actual entrees are where they excel and the pizza is just an afterthought, but for our experience, and what we were looking for them to do, it comes up pretty short."}
{"text":"This place is super cute, hugged in between a hair salon and what used to be a chee chee burger on Eastern + 215.  We went mid-day for lunch on a Monday and loved our experience. The food was lovely and our server was nice enough to comp our desserts and affogato for us.  I strongly recommend my dish the lobster ravioli over my friend's tricolore gnocchi (and I rarely say that about potato dishes ever) simply because the pink vodka ravioli sauce is to die for! Spongebob and Plankton knew what they were talking about when they said that ravioli secrets were worth fighting for.  Cautionary tale that their desserts are no joke in size, with cream puffs the size of saucers and truffles richer than Donald Trump. Honestly, it's like these desserts got their degrees and went back for grad school. Then to top off our visit, their affogatos were a great balance of creamy and bitter deliciousness.  There was simply no downside to our visit, I would definitely like to come back soon to try their carvery entrees."}
{"text":"This is the new Italian restaurant that moved into the old montessano's space on eastern Ave in Henderson.  We had spaghetti and meatballs and chicken parm.  Everything was excellent. It's a family owned business and the owner came over to welcome us. Everyone was very nice and welcoming. They are still getting settled in and with every new place there's a a learning curve, (just a few days since they opened) but first and foremost there spaghetti sauce is excellent !  We're looking forward to trying all their dishes.  Almost forgot...Their cannoli was very good as well !"}
{"text":"Wow. Great little restaurant run by, of all people, Italians! We went for my wife's birthday. My wife and son had the arinchini. There were two big ones in a very mild and delicious marinara sauce. I had the tortellini soup. I was stunned when they brought it out because it looked more like an entree. It was huge and again, very good. She had the veal parm and the boys had the chicken parm. Again, just outstanding. We haven't had good southern Italian comfort food like this since we left Boston 17 years ago. This is now our go to Italian restaurant. Oh, and the service if warm, friendly, and Italian. Buon gusto!"}
{"text":"Been here few times never had pizza ...we ordered pizza this time and MAN! was it good ~      Nice lite crust, not tomato paste for sauce, great cheese just really really good pie......     We like the food here so shouldn't be surprised the pizza was soooo delicious. I also like that the servers are Italian, just seems more inviting to me.    Also the Italian pastries in front are classic Italian and tasty too ~"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. I grew up in Boston and had some of the best Italian you could imagine from Mom and Pop restaurants. This place reminds me of those delight places. Their Alfredo is fantastic. There egg plant parm and tortellini soup is to die for. My 8 yr old son loves the Alfredo, spaghetti and meatballs, and their pizza. They have great service, and reasonable prices. They make most of their pastas in house! Do yourself a favor and and give this place a try."}
{"text":"I  don't know why they have such high reviews on here, the food is bland and the prices are way too high for what is essentially a fast food joint. I can go to a high end place and spend the same amount and get much better service and food. We will never be back, that's for sure."}
{"text":"This place is authentic... to a point where some staff only speak Italian.  Everything is made in house, it's a family business.  So everyone takes part, even the father of the owner makes the pastries, and let me just say... best cannoli!  And those cookies? Absolutely fabulous.  It's a bit pricy but personally you're paying for quality Italian food, with a sweet bistro ambiance.  I loved it, and honestly haven't experience authentic Italian in a long time.  I'm so happy to know this place exists in the world!"}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant with my girlfriend. We ordered the Italian salad to start and it was very good.  Bread was super doughy with no flavor. Put some garlic on that shit.  She ordered the gnocchi which was okay. When I ordered the Mediterranean linguine which is supposed to be scallops and shrimp in a light cream red sauce, I had asked the waited if the seafood was fresh or frozen.   His response was \"yes they are fresh...as fresh as they can be, cause we are in vegas\". To which I replied, \"what?\"  He replied \"yes, they are fresh\"  Later he came back and said they were out of scallops. Suspect sir.  He offered some alternatives to which I proceeded to order mussels in place of the scallops.   When I tasted both the shrimp and mussels they were both obviously from frozen. If not they were cooked suspiciously. The sauce was like hot red milk with no flavor.   Overall, suspect. For $24, that seafood pasta should be fresh or cooked better.  The waiter also mentioned that the Mediterranean linguine was one of their most popular items.   You're suspect trattoria italia."}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE this gem!!!   We sat in the cutest Italian setting restaurant.   The menu has a great varieties of EXCELLENT pasta dishes and seafood ,meatballs or chicken to add. Simply AMAZING food and very good prices.   Our sever Jill she was very attentive , came over poured out water and gave us suggestions for desserts!!! Thank you Jill!!!    We will be back and we will bring our family and friends that will appreciate good ITALIAN food!"}
{"text":"Still love the food at the restaurant however I do have one complaint. The music. I'm sorry but I don't think rap music is appropriate as ambiance for a wonderful Italian restaurant. Nothing against rap music as I love all music but not for the Italian experience and not loud as it was.   Maybe re-think music choice?  Thanks"}
{"text":"Finally a good real Italian restaurant in Las Vegas! I was born and raised in Italy so I'm very picky when it comes to Italian food, and I can honestly say that Trattoria Italiana is my favorite Italian restaurant. It's family owned and that gives that personal touch that you can't find in the chain restaurants; I met Milena, her husband Ninni, her brother Pasquale, her son Giovanni, Laura the waitress, and they were all so nice to me and my family! I like the atmosphere because it feels like being in a real Italian trattoria, I like the table clothes on the tables (typical in Italian restaurants but not here in the states), the bread is phenomenal, they make it with pizza dough and it's still warm when they bring it to the table, and the list goes on. I and my family will definitely go back to Trattoria Italiana!    We went there again for my husband's birthday the other day and we both had pizza: it was really good and I'm going to post pictures so you can see what I'm talking about!"}
{"text":"This was our first time back since the new owners and i'm very happy we came. The food was very good everything tasted so fresh. The sauces where all very creamy and flavorful. We will definitely be back to try more."}
{"text":"WOW. Not just great and authentic Italian, some of the best food we've eaten out in a long long time.   We eat out a lot, and obviously don't leave Yelp! Reviews very often.  This place demanded my review.  Sausage and peppers & antipasti were amazing!!! House chianti, delicious. Atmosphere, service fabulous!  Spaghetti aglio olio OMGSH and the chicken parm  was huge and so yummy. Tiramisu is best I've ever had... very authentic!! Obviously family owned.   At least half of the customers that entered while we were there were greeted with a hug.  We are considering going back tomorrow.  Lol. We also own a small family business, and only pray our clients are as pleased."}
{"text":"My Italian dining curse has broken!  Trattoria Italia is located in the location formerly Montesano's.  Its easily spotted from Eastern with plenty of parking.  Going with a fellow Yelper Stefany means I'll be trying more than one thing.  I always say yes to that!  We decided to start with the Eggplant Ripieni.  Great decision on Stefany's part.  It's a bubbling baked dish resting in sauce and covered in cheese.  The sauce is flavorful and goes well with the complimentary garlic knot basket.  This appetizer is fantastic!   For the main attractions we split the special of the day Mushroom risotto and the Orecchiette. The mushroom risotto is incredible.  The huge dish of risotto was creamy and delectable.  I didn't want to stop eating.   But since we had another entree so I had to.    The Orecchiette is served with broccoli rabe and sausage.  The buttery pasta was combined with plenty of sausage and broccoli.  Again this was a giant dish of food.  We had plenty to take home for a second meal.    Dessert? They have a case at the entrance filled with plenty of tasty treats.  I was feeling quite full but couldn't say no to a cannoli.  But instead of the large I went with a mini cannoli.  The cannoli is fresh and indulgent.  The shell was crisp with no sogginess.  Yum!   To top off the amazing food, we had wonderfully attentive service.  She was good about keeping up with our water intake.  It was a great experience and I hope to be back soon for more!"}
{"text":"If I were to be in a relationship with carbs, our online status would say \"it's complicated.\" Carbs are great and all, but I tend to make poor choices as to the quantity and frequency in which I indulge. In short, I need to be supervised. Cue Bethany E. She joined me for lunch here at Trattoria Italia to keep my carb intake in check. Long story short: we failed.  EGGPLANT RIPIENI: This baked eggplant dish is similar to eggplant parmesan but without the breading of most versions. Vegetable, sauce, and cheese, served bubbling. Goes great with the garlic knots, and the portion is large enough to serve as an entree. MUSHROOM RISOTTO: Special dish of the day but delicious enough to deserve a spot on the menu. Giant portion, saucy and packed with a variety of mushrooms. I couldn't get enough of this. Awesome vegetarian entree, may be even better with chicken.  ORECCHIETTE: Little ears pasta, my fave. Chewy, tender, tiny pasta pieces. This version is tossed with a light oil, broccoli rabe, and a rave-worthy sausage. This portion was the largest of them all and could easily be split and shared.   Our giant lunch was so filling and delicious that only a small late dinner was needed. The hefty portion of leftovers was helpfully escorted to Bethany's home rather than my own. Service was attentive without being intrusive, and location is cozy for a quiet date or ample catch-up conversation with friends. Looking forward to coming back for more!"}
{"text":"Nice little Italian place.  The homemade pastas are delicious along with the sauces.  Not the best water so we usually get pellegrino.  The canolli's are ok.  The filling is good but the shell not so much.  It would be better if they filled them at time of order.  Service isn't the best since they have a small staff so be prepared to wait and reservations a must in the evenings, as there is limited seating.  Overall the place is nice and the meatballs are good too.  We would return because of the good pasta and sauces and authentic feel.  Side note, would love to see fresh grated cheese served instead of the Parmesan."}
{"text":"Me and the girlfriend decided to stop by, I got the spaghetti and meatballs, she got the gnocchi with pesto / four cheese. Our server was super friendly and the food tasted amazing. Will definitely be coming back"}
{"text":"Today was National Meatball Day and we thought we would try the neighborhood family owned Italian restaurant! Absolutely fantastic food and service. The Insalada Italiania was more than enough for two and was very fresh. Spaghetti and meatballs were prepared to perfection.  Again, the portions were most generous! Our server, Jill, was most attentive and helpful. One of the owners, Pasquale, visited our table to make certain we were pleased with our meal! We were definitely pleased and assured him we will be returning and telling others about this wonderful treasure. Prices were moderate for the high quality of food and service.  You will be missing out if you don't try this gem.  Reservations recommended Friday and Saturday."}
{"text":"Here last week to celebrate a birthday, going back tomorrow with  my extended family. Unbelievable service, tremendous selection of delicious food..from appetizers to desserts this is as good as it gets !!! When you are here IT IS FAMILY without a doubt !!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for authentic cuisine paired with friendly, welcoming, and courteous staff, then Trattoria Italia is where you belong!   Born and raised in Italy, I am extremely picky when it comes to Italian cuisine and in all honestly, it's been quite a challenge to try and find a true authentic Italian restaurant in town.   My husband and I actually stumbled across this gem and absolutely fell in love! The staff is on point, they all speak Italian, which I love, they are super courteous and go above and beyond with their hospitality.   The food is truly outstanding! They also have an in-house pastry chef who makes superb Italian deserts. Their cappuccino is fabulous paired with a couple of their pastries, a perfect way of ending your dinner! Everytime my husband and I visit Trattoria Italia we are full for days.   I would highly recommend Trattoria Italia if you are looking to dine somewhere authentic with a cozy and  friendly atmosphere!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this restaurant more. We came with friends who had eaten here many times and raved about it. That set the bar very high - maybe that was the problem. Our server was Santini, the owner. Very personable and very welcoming. Another reason for wanting to like it more. And they honored our reservation when they were very busy on a Saturday night. Still another significant plus. So why only 3 stars. They brought the bread knots to the table right away. A hold over from Montesano's (the prior Italian restaurant in this location)?? The knots they served were a bit stale as if they had been on the counter in the kitchen way too long. Didn't stop me from eating them, but they really weren't great. We started with a salad. The $9 salad was more than enough for 4 of us to share and still have some left over. A suggestion to Santini - offer a half size salad for $5 so that when I come with just 2 people, I can still order the salad without having to throw out half. For my entree, I ordered the chicken Marsala. It came with a side of pasta. The portion was large - no leaving here hungry. It was good, not great. My wife shared the chicken parmigiana with her friend. They split it in the kitchen for them - a nice touch. And the portion was huge. More than enough for 2 to share. Again, good but not great. My friend ordered the orecchiette with broccoli rabe and sausage. Now that was a good dish. So overall, it is a solid local Italian restaurant where you can go to eat, but not a place to go to dine. I will try it again. I really do want to like it more."}
{"text":"Everyone at the table liked their meals. Reasonable prices, good food, quick and friendly service. The temperature in the restaurant was a bit warm."}
{"text":"Waited about an hour for the food..It is not an ideal place to go back for Italian food..$60 worth of food that we did not get to enjoy just because of the wait and as we walked out we notice the table that used to be empty have their food serve already.."}
{"text":"Awesome food and service! Blows Prosecco away. Large portions and very tasty. Eggplant and chicken parm delicious. Great insalata too."}
{"text":"This Italion restaurant is outstanding. Lasagne was brought to our table and the sauce was still boiling. The owners used to have a restaurant in southern highlands and when they moved the food was not as good. Once we found them, we have started going back and have not been disappointed. My friend had questions on the wine- no problem. He was allowed to sample each and then made his order. They go out of their way to make eating there a good experience"}
{"text":"Amazing food and very cute atmosphere. My son who is very picky son loved his kids Mac n cheese. My dish was so good and absolutely gorgeous! Will def be back. A perfect valentines date night  for me and my little monster"}
{"text":"The best eggplant parmigiana I have ever had. Bar none. Ever. Try the tiramisu for dessert. Absolute heaven. The pesto is to die for. Everything here is first rate including the personal service. We're hooked!"}
{"text":"Very yummy! Nice authentic atmosphere. My pregnant self was craving pasta and I wanted to try this place. We came on a Saturday night; it was a little busy but they accommodated us right away. My husband ordered a Caesar salad and the farfalle al salmone. I had the fettuccini Alfredo with chicken. Both dishes were delicious! The owner came by after our dinner to ask us if everything went well. He was very nice and courteous."}
{"text":"Vastly overrated.....  1. The food was marginal - soups lacked flavor and any sort of presentation. The entrees were acceptable, but nothing to rave about.   2. Lighting is 2X  brighter than it should be.   3. Music was a mix of Christmas songs and hip-hop.....are you kidding me?   4. Our server would rate somewhere between \"bland\" and \"cold\".   5. The owner stood literally 1 foot to my left talking to the other table for at least 10 to 15 minutes. This was highly annoying - and not to mention, intrusive.    ** The place is \"new\" - I guess.... That is really all it has going for it. Location probably does not hurt either, so people might \"fall\" for it.   Will likely never return -   Overall score:  3.5/10"}
{"text":"They have a friendly staff. We werent sure what to order the waiter gave us some recommendations and the food was delicious. The resturant is clean its not very big but nice for a date with the hubby!! Definatly a place we will come back to!!!"}
{"text":"I was so pleasantly surprised to find these jewel . I was so happy with our salad and pizza. I felt like we were in Rome. The authentic food and personnel added a touch of genuine Italian dinning to our neighborhood."}
{"text":"I've been on the hunt for a traditional Italian spot in the Henderson area for quite some time. What I have mostly found is disappointed and terrible food, until today when I found Trattoria Italia.  When you pull up it looks like a extremely small store in a strip mall. I was expecting 5 tables and a counter. When entering you're presented with two dining rooms which could easily seat 70 people. The place looks rustic and very much what you find in Italy. There are quite a few family size tables and the decor makes you feel at home. Sinatra was on the radio and the staff treats you like family. There were wine racks in the dining room as well as a wooden shelf with various items like olives, olive oil, canned tomatoes, pasta, etc. The lighting was dark but it fit the mood.   I found through speaking to the owner that it is family owned and they are from Sicily. Both him and the chef had a very thick accent and they were very humble. As guests entered I noticed that they were conversing in Italian with the owner. This place really seems like the local Italian spot in Henderson.  As for the food: I have finally found an Italian restaurant that doesn't over cooked pasta and freeze meatballs. The food is obviously fresh and the chefs puts his heart into the food.  I would definitely recommend this place to friends."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!  Food is authentic Italian, the staff all speak in Italian!  Service and food were great!  This was my first time there and I will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Took my family here on Valentine's Day. They did not fail once again! Food was delicious as usual and the customer service was exceptional! I highly recommend this place if you are looking for a nice Italian spot. The menu is simple and not crowded with a bunch of stuff. I recommend the cheese ravioli, the marinara sauce was super yummy! I won't stop going here."}
{"text":"The food is great here it's my first time here and it was amazing. I got the fettuccine Alfredo and it's was extremely good nice intimate place to for a nice little date night."}
{"text":"Amazing food amazing atmosphere great service gorgeous place...you feel like you're in Italy..."}
{"text":"Felt like real italian food when I was in Vegas last week. Yelp reviews were incouraging but they didn't communicate the nice reception I recieved so close to closing time. The unhurried attention (even though I was last customer), and the quality of the food, made me feel like I was in a neighborhood \"joint\" in Queens, northern NJ or south philly. Homemade pasta and seafood specials were enticing, but still ordered the Veal Parm that I was craving and was not disappointed. House chianti was quite reasonably priced and complimentary."}
{"text":"We loved it here! We are staying in Henderson for the weekend and didn't want to drive and/or Uber into the Strip for dinner last night. I'm glad we stumbled upon this spot! The service was phenomenal and the food was incredible. We asked for recommendations on the wine (none of us are very familiar with Italian wines) and the server was SPOT ON with his recommendations! At the end of the meal the server asked if we wanted dessert- we were too full and had to decline. However, after a few minutes he comes around the corner with a giant slice of Italian wedding cake! It was amazing!!!  We would absolutely go back to this spot if we are ever back in Henderson."}
{"text":"If you haven't tried Trattoria Italia yet, gooooo! We've been here a handful of times and each time, the food was excellent. They can get pretty busy, but service is still great and they have a tempting dessert display at the front counter - definitely worth grabbing a few things on the way out.  I love a good calamari and theirs doesn't disappoint. The insalata is delish and so filling - greens, roasted peppers, artichoke hearts, tomatoes and mozzarella. I'm getting hungry just writing this review! The fettuccini bolognese tastes like the sauce has been simmering on the stove all day and the lasagna is flavorful without being too rich or cheesy.  They take reservations so be sure to call ahead!"}
{"text":"Attention my Italian friends!! This is the relationship deal of Tattorias. This quaint and softly decorated restaurant reminds you of Italy...equipped with a Chef who was born and raised there!  Tasteful and polite service!  The bowl of minestrone soup is spot on and comes with small sized garlic knots. Caparese salad had large sized slices covered with balsamic vinegar.  All deserts are baked fresh daily. I recommend you try the cuchidati cookies...OMG...real real real Italian Cookies."}
{"text":"They have turned this place around! Quality food. Welcoming and hospitable hosts and servers. Had pizza and salad and were treated like we were spending a zillion dollars; they treat everyone nicely.  Baked goods are outstanding. All freshly made. Cookies, pastries to eat there or take away. Split a freshly made connolli that was excellent. This place is on our list for frequent return visits."}
{"text":"First time we tried today everything is fantastic!!! Fried calamari! Chicken piccata !!! Antipasto!! Cannelloni all delicious !! We will be going back for more !!! Nice people too !!"}
{"text":"On our way home we found this place on yelp. So glad we stopped in. Great food, reasonable, cozy atmosphere, very friendly staff. We will definitely be back here soon!"}
{"text":"Loved the small garlic bread balls!  The pasta sauce was very fresh.  The eggplant parmesan was great.  The service was excellent!  The Chianti could have been less biting."}
{"text":"Great food and great people. Gelato was amazing!!!! Also the cheese balls are to die for."}
{"text":"Me and my family. Especially the star Lori Mazza, we are at this restaurant. It was good and excellent. Changed my life. Service and quality of the food is unmatched. Thank you for this life change. I recommend everybody to come in."}
{"text":"We came here on a recommendation from my husbands co-worker. It is simply fantastic. The food and service is excellent. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Wonderful service, great food, reasonable prices... You're missing out of you don't try it."}
{"text":"Update to this Yelp*** Noone came. Noone called. I had to do all the calling. So I go after work with the FULL plate to get my refund and the owner MILIANA tells me \"NO REFUND. I DONT BELIEVE YOU.\" SHe wants to give me pasta. No thank you. I told her why would  I skip lunch, come here after work only to get refunded for what I paid and take more time out of my day to gain NOTHING. She was absolutely ridiculous. And she was issued about the Yelp as she brought it up. Too bad. Stupid. Why was she fighting with  me.?? I got my refund and waves  bye. THEY DONT DESERVE MY BUSINESS. OR YOURS.   So I've been here before once and the food was really good. Today I ordered for lunch and picked up and brought back to the office. I found a long hair in the food as soon as I mixed it up. I called over to the restaurant and a male named Guisepee answers and tells me there is no one that worked there with long hair. I tell him I would like someone to bring me a replacement he said to me that I could just come back. I told him that I'm not going to clock out for a second lunch to fix thier mistake. He said 'I don't know what to tell you\". What kind of bullshit restaurant is this? He tells me to give him my number and he will Call me right back. 10 mins later and still no call. What a bunch of crap. Is this the way you treat people that are patrons of your establishment Family restaurant or not Someone needs some better training  And I need my money back. I WILL Never RECOMMEND YOUR ESTABLISHMENT  AND I WILL LET EVERYONE I KNOW About THIS."}
{"text":"I would give this 6 stars too, if I could! What an incredible lunch for my dad's 72nd birthday.   Calamari Lasagna  Fettuccini Alfredo with Shrimp Linguini Seafood pasta Broccoli Rabe Asparagus  Will definitely be coming back on every trip to Vegas!"}
{"text":"Great service, great food. Came with my family on Saturday night and was delighted at how attentive the servers were - you could tell they value their customers and try to get to know every one of them on a more personal level AND plus the food was delicious.   We started off with the meatballs Nepoli for our appetizers- absolutely heavenly- the sauce was perfect for dipping the free garlic knots into too! I ate so many of those garlic knots - they came out freshly baked and piping hot. As soon as we ran out of the basket, we were immediately given another basket.    In terms of entrees, I had the lasagna, my brother had the fettuccine Bolognese and my dad had the orecchiette with sausage. All three were great, highly recommend them, especially the orecchiette if you want something a bit different :)   Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The food is fresh and so good. Our family loves coming here. We went to the owner's previous restaurant for years and gladly followed them over here. The food is better than ever and they have great desserts.  We love the family feel every time we walk in the door and the friendly staff. Highly recommend coming here when you can. Some of our favorites are the misto appetizer, chicken parm sandwich, gnocchi with pesto, and cannoli along side out cappuccino."}
{"text":"Excellent place for real Italian food!!! If you are looking for a REAL Italian family style restaurant, this is THE PLACE!!! The setting is like being in Italy. You will love the atmosphere. Great experience.    This is the best place we have been in Las Vegas. The service was perfect!! We made a reservation and had to queue only for 3 minutes, when the restaurant was flooded by customers arriving from everywhere. We had the pasta which is unique, a sublime pizza, an amazing tiramisù and cannoli (The list of pastries is delicious) and as we were really happy with the table we got, we decide to get an Italian red wine Chianti.  Excellent service, food and atmosphere. Thank you Ninni, Pasquale and Milena. I wish you al the best!!"}
{"text":"First off, the store itself is slightly hard to find. But it was truly a fantastic meal. Milena was able to welcome us and make us feel at home.  She offered great suggestions. The appetizers were great. Get the Arancini, for they were the biggest surprise.  Fantastic texture and taste. Her brother, Pasquale, kept our table and our food moving. Will be back sopn."}
{"text":"We loved Montessanos.  First time here since the change.  We loved it and will be back.  Service was great, food was great."}
{"text":"My food was amazing!!!! I had a gathering with 10 friends in the new expansion. it's great for private parties. The customer service was also great!  It's a family style restaurant,  I ordered the antipasto misto and pasta carbonara. So good!!!  Everything was seasoned well and cooked to perfection.I'll be back!!!"}
{"text":"I wish I could give more stars, but just cannot. We went to this restaurant, thinking that it was the previous restaurant there, but it was a new eatery. We decided to try it anyway. They seated us immediately, which was amazing considering how many larger parties were waiting to be seated. We were a party of 2. We were seated at a very small table in the very back, and literally squeezed in. It's as if they found out the max seating they could get by with and stuffed tables in. I'd recommend they take out 2 small tables for 2 in that back area, along with a table for 4 in the other, larger, seating area. They've crammed too many tables in the eatery...and if you aren't comfortable sitting there, then why even go eat there? Let's put it this way: They had to ask the other small table of 2 to get up so they could serve us our food. We were that packed in. The food was okay. What we both had was bland. It just needed more seasoning. The service was really great. And I mean that. I think the staff really work very hard. I wish I could give them 3 stars based on that, but the experience was not that good. They even gave us a free dessert to go, which was fantastic.  This is a new location for this restaurant, so maybe they'll refine the number of tables and add a bit more seasoning to their food. They certainly had a great number of people waiting to eat there, so they have a good following. I wish them the very best."}
{"text":"Best place to eat Italian food. My husband loves it and he says it feels juts like in NY Italian restaurant. We're coming back again."}
{"text":"This Italian tavern has excellent Italian food. The people that run the place are welcoming and joyful, they are a real Italian family. Trattoria Italia is a must in Vegas!"}
{"text":"This was a wonderful find on our first night in Vegas.  We were on our way to another place and happened upon it in a shopping center.  We were in a mood for pizza and saw the reviews so we decided to try it out.  It was delicious!  Everything from the starter knots and salad to the wonderful pizza and we finished with some yummy cookies.    The dough of the knots and pizza crust were so perfectly crunchy yet chewy.  The cheese was so delicious I could have just ordered a cheese pizza.  The mushrooms were sauteed before and delicious.  I hope we will have another meal while in town to try some other menu items!"}
{"text":"My Family brought me here for my birthday last night and we are ALL Italian and must say the Food was Amazing! I COUKDNT decide between  lobster r aviloi and Chicken pucatta so the Awesome waitress said since it's your birthday I will give you some lobster ravioli  instead of Angel hair pasta! How Sweet. The little bread knots are Awesome.. The service is impeccable and then out of Nowhere come these 2 AMAZING snowballs for dessert.. 1 coffee and 1 strawberry.. and they had trick candles! OMG THE BEST BIRTHDAY DINNER I HAVE  HAD IN MABY YEARS!! THANK YOU DIO MUCH TRATTORIA FOR MAKING MY NIGHT DIO AMAZING AND SPECIAL EITH MY FAMILY!! YOU ROCK!"}
{"text":"Had an fantastic meal here today and an even more amazing experience!  I've lived in Las Vegas for 20 years and seen many \"Italian\" places come and go. Most are New York Italian but this is the first (off-strip) since (old) Roma Deli that is actually run by Italians!   This is no deli though. It's a Trattoria which is a type of restaurant in Italy where you can enjoy home cooked Italian food for a reasonable price, and this is exactly that type of establishment.  The dad comes in the morning to cook the sauces, dolci etc. and then the rest of the family come in throughout the day to operate the restaurant. You can tell as soon as you step through the door that the place has a buzz. The decor is cosy and warm but I think it's the personalities that really make the atmosphere what it is.   I love good food & wine, hearing the chattering of people, the clinking of glasses and the waiters talking back and fourth in Italian because it reminds me of Italy. Some lady on the table next to me wasn't a fan of the guys speaking in Italian or something and complained; I was relieved when I heard the owner tell her politely that if she doesn't like people speaking in Italian then maybe this wasn't the place for her.  Can't wait to come back! This is my new favorite spot and I will be happy to refer them any business i can to help compensate for people who can't stand authentic restaurants....I hope those people choke on their never ending salad bar!  Great food & wine at a reasonable price, warm & friendly service and a fantastic location...what else do you need?"}
{"text":"While this may look like any of the standard little Italian restaurants in strip malls, it's probably one of the best in the area! Most of the staff and owners are Sicilian, and over 80% of them speak with heavy Italian accents. The food and sauces are all extremely well prepared, with a number of surprises. And the desert counter, which are all freshly made here on premises, look and taste like an old world Italian pastry shop. All the appetizers and entrées have surprising flavors and composition. The one not to miss is the calamari appetizer, which also has Italian tempura vegetables and shrimp in it. This is an entrée and itself. Also under the appetizer menu are the clams and mussels marinara. The sauce is spicy, but you can ask for the regular tomato sauce which is delicious."}
{"text":"Local spot close to home.  Love the lobster ravioli.  The little garlic knots are tasty to."}
{"text":"Went there Sat. eve for dinner.  I had the Lasagna, my wife had a dish:  pasta stuffed with angel hair and eggplant.  Our son had the Alfredo Fetticini (Sp.?).  Everyone Loved everything.  Wife's dish was out of sight.  Mine was probably the third best lasagna I have ever had.  Pizzas looked good too.  Service was great.  Everyone there is out to help you, make you feel at home, and do whatever needs to be done.  This is a VERY warm and friendly place.  We will definitely go back. Hudson & Filiz H."}
{"text":"The BEST Italian food with amazing service! I LOVE the new wine list! Ordered bottle of Brunello - the best wine i have ever tried!!! Evening in Trattoria with my family was perfect!"}
{"text":"This is possibly the most authentic Italian dining experience I have had in the US. Most of the staff is directly from Italy (I could tell that Italian was their first language), and both the ambiance and food are amazing. The owner, Pasquale, even came to greet us during the meal.  I had the eggplant parmesan as my entree and fried mozzarella balls as an appetizer. The cheese tasted so fresh; it reminded me of my trip to Naples. There was so much delicious dessert to choose from. I wanted to try the tiramisu- and it was delicious.   While I was there, I noticed that the restaurant was expanded with a new private dining/banquet room. I was so impressed with my experience that I decided to schedule our next company dinner there, as the new expansion can comfortably hold 80+ people and the price was extremely affordable.  I would definitely recommend this place as a \"must visit\" for tourists, and a great place for locals to make as their \"usual\"- especially if you want an amazing experience at less than half the cost of eating at the strip."}
{"text":"This is the BEST Italian restaurant I have ever been to . The food is authentic and the service is fantastic."}
{"text":"Food was good but not great.  I would give them another chance.  Interior decor was nice and homey."}
{"text":"I don't know how anyone could give this locally own gem anything other then five stars. The staff is friendly, and the owner is amazing;she makes you feel at home. Not only is the service on point, the food speaks for itself: my favorite is the the lobster linguine which is literally served with a whole lobster, and the tiramisu is out of this world!!"}
{"text":"This place is SO delicious! Great service, cozy setting and they have the best bread rolls and oil sauce. My fiancé and I ordered the Penne Alla Vodka an Orichetti and oh my goodness it was mouthwatering and delicious! A must try!"}
{"text":"Family owned and operated restaurant with a very homelike feel. Food was amazing and service was even better! We will be back many more times!"}
{"text":"Hands down this is Las Vegas best mom and pop style Italian cuisine off the strip. I usually don't order a meatball anywhere else because the meatball marinara from this place is the gold standard that most other establishments can't mimic.   There is just so much flavor in this and in every other item I've ordered here. You have to be hungry if you order the chicken Parmesan because it is a large piece of battered chicken! The garden salads with their oil and vinegar dressings have many ingredients. The spaghetti and meatballs are always good as the sauce is soaked well into the noodles."}
{"text":"Good solid food I love that they have a nice gluten free options. The service was great and fast.  The pastas are all made in house. The gnocchi was disappointing and was very mushy. The other pastas were very good. I enjoyed their meatballs they were very flavorful. You cannot leave hungry here the portions are large."}
{"text":"Went in for the first time tonight and within the first bite of garlic bread we knew we would be regulars! Yes even the garlic bread is THAT good, better than we have had anywhere else. Everything is authentic, the atmosphere is incredibly warm and inviting, and the staff is unmatched by any restaurant around . Do yourself a favor if you are on this side of town... stop in for a relaxing dinner, enjoy a glass of wine, and finish off your meal with a delicious cannoli or piece of tiramisu. I promise you the only thing you may regret is not being able to finish off the entire meal since there portions are very generous! The staff makes you feel welcome and like family, who wouldn't want to revisit such an inviting place with yummy food?!?   They are going to be an amazing success here! Welcome to the neighborhood  we cannot wait to come back and visit Trattoria Italia where Italian food is done right!! Thank you for an amazing experience, see you next week... or maybe in a day or two"}
{"text":"Milena was a great server and the food was great. She suggested a sicillian wine that was great... will come again for sure!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic True Italian Restaurant. This place is in the same spot where Montasantos use to be. My daughter and I walked in and had dinner, she ordered the Spaghetti Aglio' Oglio and I have the Eggplant Parmigiano and both dishes were full of taste and quality. The sauce was perfect and not NY Italian style but real Italian. The Aglio' Oglio was exactly like my mother made it. I am highly recommending Trattoria Italia! The desserts are made fresh on the premises and the service was stellar! They will be expanding soon, blowing out the walls and taking over next door making it a banquet room for catered events. Run don't walk there, you will be so happy."}
{"text":"I can't figure out how this place could ever get anything less than 5 stars! The owners and servers are wonderful! The servers are attentive and we never had to wait for drinks or our next course. The food is unbelievable so delicious. Our new favorite Italian restaurant! Even as it became busy and crowded the service remained consistent."}
{"text":"I've lived and searched Las Vegas for 9 years looking for great Italian food.....the search is over.....forget the overpriced Strip.....best Italian west of New York City!!!!"}
{"text":"What a great place to eat amazing Itailian food. I had the lobster ravioli in a vodka sauce that was the most amazing vodka sauce I ever had and the extra pieces of lobster was great. My boyfriend had the spaghetti with clams in the garlic spicy red sauce that was just to die for. The best part was the house made tiramisu. It was decadent and creamy. A must place to go."}
{"text":"The spaghetti could've been better, but as far as the meatballs, they could not have been any better, some of the best I've ever had. Nice, casual, authentic Italian cuisine."}
{"text":"Definitely not a replacement for Montesanos. Average food at best and terrible service. We were one of four tables being served during lunch and the server spent more time behind the front counter than helping guests."}
{"text":"We went here looking for some homemade Italian food like someone's Italian grandma would make.Like some amazing sauce and flavorful food.Based on the reviews our expectations were big! Disappointing to say the least.My wife ordered the Chicken Marsala which consisted of 2 thin and flavorless pieces of chicken with mushrooms that she thought might be canned.Sent that back and got the Eggplant parm which was a little better after she requested more sauce for it.I had the Lasagna and it was terrible.With several other authentic Italian restaurants in the area,we won't be back.Our waitress was attentive and helpful though.Comfy atmosphere in a small strip mall on Eastern."}
{"text":"Amazing food and great people.  A family owned and operated place with owners and family from Italy. It's hard to get more authentic than that. All of the sauces are made fresh daily from authentic Italian recipes. The desserts are made every morning by an Italian pastry chef. The cannoli was the best I've ever had. The lobster ravioli was amazing, with huge pieces of lobster. We drove clear across town to eat here and it was totally worth it."}
{"text":"I wanted a Caprese salad and Yelp this Italian place. close to Siena Campus if you have a Love One hospitalized (it was my case). this italian place is 5mns drive from the hospital. I called and placed my order, 10mns later it was ready! caprese salad :) with pearl mozzarella on a bed of greens, and they gave me some mini homemade bread YUM When i walked in i couldn't resist to try the pastries of course! i bought A puff with Chantilly and almond, 2 chocolate cookies filled with pistachio. I sneaked in the restaurant room and it was very cute! Decent price, good food and pastries. I am glad i found this place"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch on a Friday afternoon after reading yelp reviews. We were the only table but the server said they are much busier for dinner. We ordered the soup and the chicken parmigiana. The soup was very watery and had very little flavor. The chicken parmigiana was good. They were nice enough to split it on two plates for us. Overall it was ok but not sure we'd go back."}
{"text":"I was actually starting to like this place. But this is what happened, so I go in and I order the baked cannelloni. The gentleman I gave my order to I think is either the manager or the owner he's the bald headed guy. So I get my food and then after I'm about a third into my food he brings over my bread which I thought was a little late I mentioned it to him and he did not respond. I think maybe if he wasn't on his stupid computer I would have got better service. The food here is very good but that was very disappointing. And the little bread knots that he gave me were stale. One time before I did order dessert to go and I was going to let it slide but that too was stale I think it's been sitting in the glass case for way too long. Too many Italian restaurants in this town not going to go back."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. I'm almost don't want to review it because I want it to stay somewhat of a hidden gem but it deserves praise.  It is my go-to restaurant when I have friends visiting from out of town because I am always confident they will enjoy their food.  I love their garlic knots, fried mozzarella, and their antipasto appetizer is amazing, I highly recommend it. I usually always get a pasta dish or gnocchi and they're always so accommodating if I want a different sauce than what's listed on the menu or if I'd like to add in a different protein. Their pizzas are also really delicious. The TIRAMISU is out of control good. The cannolis are authentic as it gets too. I personally love that it is an family run Italian restaurant, and I love way they absolutely stick to authentic Italian cooking. They don't over salt everything like Maggiano's or other chain restaurants, the pasta is ALWAYS cooked perfectly, and they still know American taste because the portions are huge, and you can honestly be as big of a fat kid as you want at this place.  I personally also love that Trattoria Italia is informal because it feels so welcoming, like you're walking into a friend's place. Is that cheesy? It's true though. You can come here for a date, just after work, on a Sunday evening when you look like a bum, it doesn't matter. I've even come here once with my fiancee right after the gym.  In my experience, I've never had to wait longer than what seemed normal for my food or check to come to the table, and I've been there on busy nights. Yes, there are places that have gotten my food out faster, but again, it's never been so long that we all start asking \"ok where's our food?\" The price point of this place is also great. I don't think it's expensive at all. It's not cheap, and it's not cheap food, but it's still way cheaper than many Italian places, if not most. I definitely recommend, and will continue to be a regular as long as it is here!"}
{"text":"Casual atmosphere and dining. Great customer service. Food was delicious and portions sizes were perfect. Not too spendy for a family of 5. Excellent first impression! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Amazing dinner and ambiance! It feels like visiting family here, and we are treated as such! Grazie mille !!!"}
{"text":"The carbonara brought me to tears. It is that good. The bread knots with the olive oil garlic were perfection. Sister had chocolate gelato and I brought home mini cannoli and marzipan cookies. The desert case is to die for. Will he back."}
{"text":"Came in from Los Angeles for a couple on days. We wanted good Authentic Southern Italian food. My brother & I are super picky & always eat Veal Parm. We both got that & so did my hubby. OMG it was just like what you get in NY or NJ. The veal was so soft & the portions were very large. The decor was warming & homey. We will be back on our next trip in a couple of weeks. Excellent food, fast Service & efficient waiters. If you like southern Italian then you must try this Restaurant."}
{"text":"First time trying this place. I have to say, the food here was one of the best Italian I have had in Las Vegas. I've always thought Italian is heavy food, but I have to say it was light and rich. We had lasagna, eggplant parmigiana, and the special mushroom raviolis. All was delish. Can't wait to go back and try something else.   This service was as authentic as you can get with Italians serving you. Great service by the way. You can tell there are a lot of regulars coming to eat here.  Overall, one of the best Italian restaurants in Vegas."}
{"text":"This restaurant has fantastic, authentic Italian food, great vibe, and wonderful service at a very fair price. My husband is Italian and was very glad to find Trattoria Italia as he is often craving the food and ambiance from home and after several years living here in the states he has finally found just that!! We have had their pizza, aranchini, Canoli, and cassata Siciliana...all were fantastic! If you're looking for a great Italian place to eat here in Vegas, I highly recommend Trattoria Italia!!"}
{"text":"Hostest was super rude! Started asking if we have a reservation meanwhile the whole restaurant is empty.. the bold headed waiters cologne was horrible! Every time he walked by we all covered our noses.. the food  was amazing and Jill gave great service!"}
{"text":"This is a great new family run business on Eastern Avenue in Henderson NV.   All food and deserts are made in house   So far, we have tried: Caesar Salad Fettuccine Alfredo Fettuccine Bolognese Gnocchi  Lasagne  Tiramisu  Cannoli Gelato with Mixed Berries  Everyone of them was delicious."}
{"text":"I came here last week for the first time, its very near to my hose. The food was mind blowing, I had their frutti di mare dish and it was super fresh and tasty, the dessert was also very good, if you are a tiramisu lover you should definitely come to this place. Ask for Danny if you love good service."}
{"text":"Great little Italian restaurant located off of Eastern. We started out with the arinchini which was devine! Most places you get 2 large ones, but here you get five nestled in a plate of marinara sauce. Delish. Next I had the gnocchi with the Ninni sauce and the little lady had chicken parm. Both dishes came out perfect with the chicken parm having a great crust and the cook modifying the dish to meet the request we had. Service was top notch and the prices was appripriate. No down sides at this little gem."}
{"text":"Great first impression of this place. Lobster ravioli with the vodka sauce was amazing, the lasagna was awesome, and the chicken piccata with penne noodles was great. We came with friends who have eaten here before a few times and they said they've never been disappointed with any dish. Service is friendly. We will definitely come back when we're craving authentic Italian food!"}
{"text":"Ordered for pick up. Pizza, spicy penne, penne in pink sauce. All amazing. Taste fresh and all still hot after 15 min drive home. Will definitely be back to eat at restaurant!"}
{"text":"Finally found a true Italian restaurant. The lasagna is amazing! The deserts are just as delicious as the main course!!"}
{"text":"Great food I had the Veil Parmesan very tasty. I enjoyed the sauce and tenderness of the veil. Also the cheese balls are very good. The minestrone soup very good. I highly recommend this place. Nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"I went there for dinner a week after they opened...what can I say?! I am Italian born and raised and It was just like being back in my beautiful country!!! Just in one of those little trattoria that are so common in Italy! The food is to die for! ( you have to try also the sfogliatella!! Wow!!!) great pizza too and the owners from Sicily add a really Italian style atmosphere and style to the whole package!! A++++++ you have to try, I will go back for sure."}
{"text":"Truly a wonderful dining experience. The atmosphere is warm, quaint and inviting. The owners, Santino and Carmela Corso, and the entire crew go out of their way to make dining in their restaurant as though you're family in their home. The flavors and dishes are truly Sicilian as the Corso's are from Palermo! I've dined at Trattoria Italia many times and I've never been disappointed. The display case filled with authentic Italian sweets should not be overlooked. Don't miss this gem on Eastern Ave in Henderson. Your palate will thank you! Buon appetito!"}
{"text":"Wow! Our new favorite place. Amazing food, friendly service. The lasagne and profiteroles were amazing. We were looking for a great quality Italian restaurant without the Strip prices and found it. I was particularly impressed with the desserts. I'm kind of hard to please, since I usually like the desserts I make better than what most restaurants serve, even when they make it themselves (they're typically too sugary), but these were so good (my husband got the cannoli. Best in town!)  Can't wait until they have outside seating next week."}
{"text":"Lovey place and staff very attentive. Foods are delicious!!! They have Italian night every Tuesday. Sharing Italian culture, language and  music. I'll definitely come back here :)"}
{"text":"Amazing authentic Italian food...great service! Save room for dessert! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I'm not too much of an Italian food person, but once in a while I do get a craving. Their Antipasto appetizer was yummy. I just wish there was more cheese offered.   Their chicken marsala is pretty delicious as well. Got a side of mushrooms and mixed some in, since I'm a big mushroom fan, although the side of mushrooms could have been a great side by itself. Great flavor. The meat sauce that came with the baked penne was yummy as well. There really wasn't a lack of flavor on anything.   For dessert, had the cannolis. Great way to end a nice meal. Yes, their meals are by all means not cheap, but you really get a great serving. Plenty of food for leftovers that were equally good the next day. If ever I get the craving for Italian again, I'll visit this place for sure."}
{"text":"Best Italian in Henderson!!! Five star  - authentic and perfectly cooked dishes here.  Quality par to NYC Italian restaurants.  At last good Italian in the Vegas area (not counting the Strip 5-Star Hotels).  This place has nice ambiance, a nice dessert & pastry glass showcase in the entrance - they also have delicious desserts here! Take them to go if you are too full after your meal.  We'll be back for more!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite go to casual Italian spots in Henderson. Always quality service very friendly staff and top notch Italian cuisine. Highly recommend checking this spot of if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"5 stars +++++! Their food was amazing! Home made flavor! We got mozzarella balls w/ sauce, rolls w/ dipping oil, salad, eggplant parm, spagetti, & ravioli. Everything was delicious! The waiters were very friendly & they have some cookies & desserts too. Looking forward to going back here for dinner soon!"}
{"text":"Totally amazing. We split a flavorful Italian salad that was dressed perfectly, loaded with olives, marinated roasted red peppers, mozzarella and artichokes. The entrees we chose were gnocchi ninni, chicken piccata, chicken Parmesan sandwich and orecchiette in a garlic oil with sausage and broccoli rabe.  My gnocchi came from heaven right into my plate. The sauce was a marscapone base with roasted red peppers, garlic and spinach. Creamy, dreamy, plenty to take home.   Most remarkable is the service, a family that made us feel like family. And the prices make this one of the TOP VALUES around. Grazie, Trattoria Italia, until the next time!"}
{"text":"We eat from this restaurant a lot but usually we take out or have it delivered. We decided to dine in the restaurant today with family. The food was amazing, as expected. The service was top notch and everyone was so friendly. The downside of my experience today was I had to do an emergency diaper change for my 8 month old and there was no changing station. It was awful. The funny part to me was there was a mat for your feet at the toilet...not sure what purpose that serves. A family friendly place, but expect to change diapers in your car, at your table, or on the bathroom floor."}
{"text":"This is one of those hidden gems in town.  Everything about this place was amazing.  The service was great and the server was really nice. He helped us ordered by telling us what was his favorite.  I had the gnocchi with their vodka sauce. It was amazing.  My friend and I also shared their meatballs. Do not skip out on the meatballs they are really really tasty.  Overall this place is amazing and I will be bringing alot of my friends back.  A truly hidden gem."}
{"text":"Went there tonight for the first time for my little girl's birthday (she loves Italian food). The staff, food, and atmosphere were all fantastic. They even brought out the cake (I brought in) sang to her. It was a great night! I have one happy 5 year old. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Noticed we have a new little family owned Italian restaurant, and was quick to check them out.    We were immediately welcomed and seated by the staff. Our server took our drink orders, and within minutes we had water, a warm bread basket and olive oil. That bread was amazing!   We ordered Cheese Ravioli, and Baked Ziti. Both were delicious! The flavors were on point, enough Cheese, and good portions-especially the Ziti-that was huge!   The service was phenomenal. But then again, they opened only 3 days ago, so its expected.   Welcome to the neighborhood, Trattoria! We plan on visiting often. Please keep your prices reasonable, your service great, continue making delicious food, and you will be a success!"}
{"text":"Really wish I could like this place more, but the couple of times I've gone the food really wasn't great. I come from an Italian family, I lived in Italy. I know what great Italian food should be and this place does not live up to those standards. I guess for an Italian place out in the middle of Henderson, NV this place is considered \"good\" that's why they have almost 5 stars, but my experiences have been different. The last time we went in the service was bad (our waitress didn't know the specials to start off), the food was average (just like always), and the bill came out to $75 for two entrees and one appetizer, which I don't mind paying if the food is great, but it wasn't. This spot should be 3.5 stars at best."}
{"text":"Went back again. Really want this place to make it. Thought it would be more together by now.  The good:  Spaghetti cooked well. Sauce was good. Meatballs good.   I had Pizza with hot Italian Sausage and mushrooms. Very good crust, sauce, spicy sausage and mushrooms.   Orecchiette was OK, but kind of boring.   The bad:  Table bread was hard, cold, old and burnt.  Pizza crust was burned badly...not in a good way. Love a well done crust, but this one just tasted burnt.   Orecchiette was sitting in a bowl of water. Not sure if it wasn't drained properly or maybe just from the veggies?  Diet Coke was expired. Diet drinks don't age well and the dates need to be closely monitored. Mine was beyond the date.   I will probably go back again, but it will not be on our regular rotation list."}
{"text":"Don't walk in at 9:30 because they'll shoo you away and say they're \"closed\" when they actually are supposed to close at 10. I grew up in the restaurant industry and that's not how you run a business."}
{"text":"I love Love LOVE this place. It's authentic and so tasty. I can't say enough good things about this restaurant. I would give them more stars if I could.   I am a creature of habit, always ordering the same few things but I have tried something new each time we've been and loved it all. The pizza is great, the penne vodka is delicious, obsessed with the risotto and the meatballs :). Honestly, you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"soooo.. we really liked this place (as u can see from our previous review) until today.  called in ahead and ordered two salads for pick up for lunch,  1 caesar salad        $9.00 1 antipasto misto  $13.00  we got home and immediately started eating. upon tasting the caesar dressing, i noticed it had no flavor whatsoever. it tasted like flour mixed w/water... it was weird.  we called and very politely let the woman on the phone know that they may want to taste the dressing as it was completely flavorless.  we have caesar dressing here at home so this wouldnt have been a big deal, if her response wouldve been appropriate... she acted like we were bothering her by calling!!! like we got it for free or something!!! she could not care less .. no apology, no \"hey, thx for lettn us kno!\", nothing. just \"ok\", \"ok\", \"ok\", bye!!?    bleh... its pretty hard to screw up salads.. but they did.  $28 worth of wilted, old lettuce and flavorless white gravy!!! lol  never again. theres way too many places in this city to choose from."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place on Black Friday (I know, of all days!!!!?!!! lol) and just needed a place to rest after all the madness.  We ordered the fried mozzarella balls and lasagna, based on the recommendation of our waiter, and was very pleased.  Mozzarella balls were HUGE, and although, just 4 pieces in an order, they were perfect for 2 people. It was breaded nicely, not oily at all, and oooeeey gooey in the middle.  Lasagna has to be my favorite lasagna for the meer fact that it wasn't heavy. Don't get me wrong, I love me some baked lasagna that's cheesy and thick but, this was quite refreshing with the great amount of red sauce.   Don't forget to ask for the bread knots because (when hot and fresh) they go great with the aforementioned sauce of the lasagna.  Other than the food, we thoroughly enjoyed talking with the owners' son - I wish we got his name - as he talked about his family's business and when he first came here from Italy. It was a great conversation!  I will definitely be back =)"}
{"text":"The BEST & REAL ITALIAN Food in Las Vegas! So many wannabes  Italian Restaurants in Vegas. This is the real deal! SIMPLY THE BEST!"}
{"text":"While overnighting in Vegas, my wife said, \"Let's find a good Italian eatery.\"  We did.  Trattoria Italia was excellent!  We started with Caprese.  My wife had Penne Arrabbiata -- \"perfectly spicy\" is how she described this dish.  I had Linguine Pesto w/chicken.   We finished the meal off with 2 Cannoli -- we were told \"dad\" made them ... whoever did, yum!  In past visits to Vegas, we would frequent a chain restaurant.  No more!"}
{"text":"Man o man. This place is on fire  best Italian food in Nevada. Must come and try. Friendly staff great food."}
{"text":"Came here because of good reviews, stood up for a good 5 minutes while 3 servers saw me and is waiting for a seat. I don't know what the deal was but they treated me as a ghost. Just left the place and will never come back. Will be telling my friends and family about it."}
{"text":"Fantastic food.   Impeccable service.   Authenticity on point.   If you are craving the best Italian food in the city - and off the strip prices! - look no further than this hidden gem right off the St Rose Pkwy exit from the I-15.   Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Trattoria Italia is a refreshing authentic italian restaurant. Excellent service and healthy portions.  Perfect for families looking for an affordable night out. Best Value and Quality in Henderson."}
{"text":"We decided to have Trattoria cater a small, family party.  Everyone was so impressed by the great food.  The quality was outstanding and we had more than enough leftovers for everyone to take home.  We would use Trattoria again in a heartbeat.  It is our new favorite place to recommend."}
{"text":"The best Italian restaurant we have tried. Authentic food that suits any taste buds. Quantities are ample and a dish will easily service two. Tiramisu we had there is the best ever. Will go to Vegas just to visit the restaurant again!.  Ample parking, family friendly and wonderful wait staff.  Also, they have a big selection of desserts at the counter and seemed to be doing brisk business."}
{"text":"Fantastic Italian atmosphere great food and delicious pastries great service friendly faces will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Nothing but good things about this place! Super cute restaurant perfect for date night or a family get together. Came during the week and got seated right away. Received some fresh bread & olive oil dipping sauce not long after we got seated.   First off... portions are huge! We started with the Caesar salad which was very fresh & creamy. Would definitely order that again.   Entrees we got the basil pesto pasta with vegetables and lasagna. The basil pasta was perfect, not too much oil or cream for the sauce and there was just as much vegetables as there was pasta. The lasagna was also a big heaping portion and could definitely tell was homemade! I was looking forward to my leftovers the next day :)  Their menu was pretty large but I'm excited to go back and try something different... or maybe even try one of their delicious desserts."}
{"text":"Let me put it this way: if Trattoria Italia's Lobster Ravoli wasn't soooo incredibly good, this place would be a one star joint.   To begin with, most food comes out way under salted and under seasoned. Very bland. If you send it back it comes out just fine the second time around, but when sending food back just to achieve flavor becomes their M.O., something isn't right.   Positives: pizza is good, cioppino is good, and lobster ravioli is great.   Negatives: food is very under flavored, service at the front is very pushy. Prices are too high for what you're getting. Oh, and their caprese salad has microscopic amounts of basil, and a copious amount of spinach and lettuce. Seriously?! I didn't order a house salad with tomato and mozzarella.   As for the staff, I've just come across much more accommodating staff elsewhere. Customer service and family atmosphere is definitely lost in this dive.  Putting aside all biases from my former love of Montesano's, it really is not the best restaurant around. So many other places I will go to in the future besides trattoria.  Would I recommend this place to others? Absolutely not.  Would I come back here myself? Only for the lobster ravioli."}
{"text":"2nd visit and will be back! The food was fantastic and the service phenomenal! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Nice place and the two folks who were working were nice as well.  We got 3 cokes, a 16 inch pizza, meatball sandwich and a kids spaghetti, with tax we spent $43.30.  Not cheap but authentic and very good.  Kids liked it and so did mom and dad.  I would go back for sure and next time get dessert, they had a ton of choices."}
{"text":"My in-laws took us to this place last night, saying it was one of the best Italian places they'd ever been too! After last night... I'll never doubt their epicurean recommendations! This place was AMAZING!!   Two of us had the spaghetti and meatballs... three meatballs with this entree proved too much for us to eat while there!! (See picture)  One has the spaghetti with hot peppers (can't remember the name) and she loved it!!  The other had the meatball appetizer with a bed of angel hair pasta  (he is not crazy about having a lot of marinara sauce!! At the end of the night, we were all VERY happy with our choices!! Be sure to save room for dessert!"}
{"text":"My first time at this great little spot in the Henderson burbs. Loved the calamari, clams, pasta and fhe little garlic bread squares were baked to perfection with the perfect touch of garlic. Great Italian wines and the service extremely good. Can't wait to hurry back!"}
{"text":"I ordered the Fettuccine Alfredo & the Calamari Taormina.  The fettuccine was cooked perfectly, but the alfredo sauce was lacking in flavor.  I even tried to dress it up w/ Parmesan cheese & additional spices, but that didn't help.  The shrimp & calamari in the Calamari Taormina were overcooked & the zucchini was so scarce that it shouldn't even be mentioned in the description.  The garlic knots were the best part of the meal.  I ordered the items for delivery through Grubhub.  Not sure if that made an impact on the quality."}
{"text":"Welcoming/accommodating from the minute you enter! Delicious knots to start with olive oil provided, great soups, pastas and pizza. Especially their meat sauce! Perfect for families or a date night. Will come back when in the area again!"}
{"text":"Visiting from California and looking for something off the strip. The food was amazing! Came with a group of 6 and everyone loved their meals. You can't go wrong try this place!"}
{"text":"Excellent!!!!  The bread knots with the olive oil are addictive!   My Wife had the Chicken Picatta.  The sauce was perfect and definitely made from scratch...not over powering and/or thick like most places we have been.   I had the baked penne...again, perfect!  The sauce was a great bolognese and the pasta was perfect al dente!   The service was absolute tops and were treated like family.  We would highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"What a great place. So happy to see the owners of a previous restaurant in Southern Highlands here. The food is amazing and matches the service and quality of food. You get that family feel and atmosphere along with authentic Italian specialties. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I am not not an Italian food fan, but I wanted to try Trattoria Italiana due to the good review on Yelp. I arrived with a bottle of wine in my hand and had a reservation at 7pm. The ristorante was full and around 10 to 15 people were waiting at the entrance. The owner look at my reservation and  I got a warm welcome. No problem with the wine ($15 corkage fee). After a minutes we have been seated in the back room at a very nice table. Waiter came immediately serving some filtered water and drop some bread with olive oil at the table. Open the wine with a smile  and telling us the specials. The room was full and all table were taking. We Ordered some Calamari  (sauted) and Insulate Italiana for appetizer. 3 plates of pasta . My friend was happy to get the gluten free option. The owner touch the table during main course. My spaghetti were perfectly al dente. Dessert was tiramissu and the waiter was very nice to get out of his way to bring a little bit of raspberry and blackberry to my friend who is glutten free and dairy free. The food was serve in large portions . The service was exceptional. The prices very reasonable. The welcome from the owner was magnificent. A special thank you to DANNY R, our server who take is time, to explain the menu, give recommendation, open our wine, always smiling , spoke quietly with no rush to a difficult table of 3 who had 1 gluten-free dairy free, 1 vegan, an 1 normal menu. The entire experience deserve 5 stars! Because we spend a relaxing time with good food at a low price."}
{"text":"My wife is from upper New York with a strong Italian family. It is hard to find Italian food that will bring her back to what her family would cook. This place did just that with the food but also the wine. This is now one her favorite restaurants."}
{"text":"With so many good Italian places in and around Henderson, this place leaves you feeling very unfulfilled at best, a little ripped off at worst. Seems like they cut corners to Save money on some items. I have given them multiple chances but it's over."}
{"text":"I took my friend on a date and we enjoyed some great Italian food. Thanks again Trattoria for the great experience. Very well recommended."}
{"text":"Amazing Food!  We all turned to each other and said NEW FAVORITE ITALIAN PLACE!  Can't wait to go again and we didn't even try the cookies and pastries.  We all ordered different items and we all said the same thing - Yum!!"}
{"text":"You rarely find an Italian restaurants in Las Vegas ran by Italians.  The experience at Trattoria Italia is always a great one and the hospitality provided by Pasquale and his family is next to none. Though I can't say this is the best option for a pool bod, it's one of my favorite. The scallops and shrimp pasta, and chicken parmigiana are two of my favorites, not to mention the homemade tiramisu which is my favorite in town!"}
{"text":"We love this place, I would definitely recommend it. Chicken parmigiana, veil parm, spaghetti and meatballs, and the desserts are all fantastic and homemade. The service can be a little slow at times though because it's all homemade I think. The atmosphere is unique too, very \"old school/local neighborhood\" restaurant."}
{"text":"I tried the sea food pasta from this place and it was really good. The other pasta, the one with the mushroom sauce was not too good though. Overall it was good. I really enjoy their olive oil mixture for the bread."}
{"text":"Very authentic Italian Trattoria.  My father is law is Italian and knows his food.  He was speaking to the entire waitstaff in Italian and was laughing the whole time.  He was very impressed with everything except the Osso Bucco which he rates as average.  Family owned and run.  A great neighborhood find.  We will ba back many times I am sure."}
{"text":"This is my new spot! I'm Sicilian and very picky. The food is fabulous! The four of us all tried something different and we were all delighted with our selections! The service was warm and friendly. Such a great experience I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"I need to preface this review by stating that I have lived 2 minutes away from this gold mine since it opened over 10 years ago. I am incredibly disappointed that I hadn't tried this place prior to my first trip here about a month ago.   This is our second time eating here and it was as good this time around as it was the first time. The garlic knots (which are complimentary) were warm, fresh, and delicious.  We got the mozzarella balls as an appetizer. Amazing  The balls are gigantic and the cheese is fresh. It's served on a bed of marinara which is super flavorful (if you can make the garlic knots last, the marinara sauce would go great with it).   For the main course I ordered fettuccine alfredo with chicken. It's my go to Italian dish and I am heavily judgemental of places based off of how well this dish fairs. I have to give it an A+. The fettuccine noodles were cooked al dente and there was just the right amount of sauce.   Overall, I definitely recommend this place. The serves is good, the atmosphere is nice, and you really can't go wrong with the food. If you're ever in the area, be sure to stop by, you definitely won't be disapppinted."}
{"text":"Ambiance is just right. Service is just perfect. They genuinely want you to have a great dining experience. But the food....wow. So very good. From the breadsticks to the penne alla vodka, perfection. Glad to have authentic Italian in the neighborhood. The New Yorker in my house is quite picky. And he was very pleased."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite place! I had a last minute birthday dinner with my friends and family here, I called around 5 Pm to make a reservation for 10 at 7 PM and they were super friendly and set it up right away. When we walked in at 7 PM, our spot was ready for us, we didn't have to wait at all. The food here is amazing! Every single dish we ordered was delicious! I've been back at least 3 times after my birthday and the service and food is always on point!"}
{"text":"I was here for the first time late yesterday afternoon. The restaurant is warm and inviting, the staff is very friendly and the menu is extensive for such a small spot. Since I was hungry but not for a full meal, I ordered the sausage and pepper sandwich which ended up being a meal in itself. I spoke with one of the owners who advised that everything is made fresh daily and that the meats and cheeses are imported. This place is well worth any amount of driving and I will be back!"}
{"text":"I can't recommend this place enough! Don't be deterred by it's strip mall location, this place is worth it. My family and I just finished dinner at this lovely, authentic Italian restaurant. All of us were supremely satisfied with our meals. The lasagne was the best I've had since I visited Florence. I can never finish a whole meal, but this time I cleaned my plate. Two of our party highly recommend the flavorful and filling gnocchi ninni. Before our meal, we shared the Caesar salad. It was enough to share between four of us and the dressing was fresh and delicious. After dinner, our friendly and attentive server, Danny, surprised us with two profiteroles-chocolate and coffee. Both were devoured within a couple minutes, even though we were stuffed. Seriously, make time to eat here."}
{"text":"Stopped in after reading the other Yelp reviews. Nice easy location with lots of parking. It was around 8:30 on a Friday night. They let us pick a seat and got our drink order right away. We ordered the pesto pasta and baked eggplant parmigiana. They brought us out some rolls that were ok, and when our food arrived and I asked for Parmesan I was shocked that he turned around to the table behind us and grabbed a bottle of Parmesan, like you would see at a pizza joint, I would have expected an Italian restaurant owned by Italians they would have fresh grated Parmesan . The portions were nice, the food was hot. My eggplant was extremely soggy and mushy with way to much mozzarella cheese so I did not eat much. The side of pasta was good and my husbands pesto pasta was good. The service was good, but could have been better."}
{"text":"My food was amazing!!!! I had a gathering with 10 friends in the new expansion. it's great for private parties. The customer service was also great!  It's a family style restaurant,  I ordered the antipasto misto and carbonara. So good!!!  Everything was seasoned well and cooked to perfection.I'll be back!!!"}
{"text":"It's fine.  I wished it was much better.  Dry chicken Parm, sauce is WAY too sweet.  Service is good, and the other dishes we had were just ok."}
{"text":"Perfect little Italian place.  Authentic staff.  Friendly great food.  Can't go wrong here.  Been there twice."}
{"text":"Arguably the best Italian food I have ever had. The gnocchi was perfectly cooked and the sauces weren't overbearing. The staff was friendly, knowledgeable, and timely. The atmosphere is perfect for a first date or a family outing. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Fantastic find in our neighborhood.   Great service and the food is absolutely over the top.  Love the staff and we highly recommend.   Please support this local restaurant.   Will be back next week"}
{"text":"Oh my goodness, more than a treat! First off, if you're looking for a very chic & upscale Americanized pasta place, this isn't it. Thankfully, it's the exact opposite. I think we were the only table in the restaurant not speaking fluent Italian to the waiters & owners. Amazing! The bread was great, the meatballs Napoli appetizer was outstanding. I think the best meatballs I have ever been served. Main courses were superb...skipped dessert because we were too full, but their case of cannolis and other Italian specialties looked to die for. You can feel the family roots and the love the second you step in until the moment you leave. Can't wait to go back! This place is the real deal."}
{"text":"I had mixed feelings about this new Italian spot. I came in wanting to like this place and the experience started out well. Pros are that there is plenty of parking, menu prices are reasonable, and I enjoyed my meal. Cons are that they are new so there are service kinks to work out and the sweets were not good.  On a Sunday evening my husband and I were looking for a casual Italian spot to grab dinner. Service started out great with a prompt seating even though they were busy. Our waitress greeted us quickly, drink orders were taken, and rolls were served.   The rolls to start were okay. I enjoyed them, but it wasn't like bread at other restaurants that draws me back in. I also had a glass of the house Muscato. Nice flavor, but it had a carbonated texture that turned me off a bit.  Chicken Marsala with a side of pasta was calling my name. It was a large serving that included two pieces of chicken. The portion was perfect since I wanted to save half for my lunch the next day. I really enjoyed the Chicken Marsala and would order this dish again. My side of Sautéed Spinach was loaded with garlic and delicious as well. My husband had Ravioli and said it compared to the canned version kids love. He said he would never return here based on his dish.   The waitress that had been friendly and attentive went MIA around the time the check should have arrived. By the time the check finally showed up I was armed with credit card to speed up the process, but she dropped and ran. Thus began the long wait for her to return to get the card and close us out.   While that wait began I went to the dessert counter to get goodies to go. It took an unreasonable amount of time to even get the owner to acknowledge my presence. Since they were busy I started out patient, but it ended up being excessive. He finally acknowledged me, but then the phone rang and he asked if he could grab it. I run into the same situation at my job so I was understanding and said it was fine, but then he didn't come back to me after the call. He wandered away and the process began again. I should have taken this as a sign, but I waited and ordered four desserts.   The desserts looked great in the case, but three of the four ended up in the trash. I'm a huge sweets person, but these were just a waste of calories. Texture and taste were all wrong on three of the four. The fourth I ate just out of confusion that it could really be so flavorless.   Overall, my meal was pretty good and the pricing was low compared to other Italian options in the area. I also like that the restaurant is casual making it a good option for families or nights where dressing up just isn't enticing. The bad service and bad sweets ruled this out for future dining out experiences, but I would consider them for take-out in the future."}
{"text":"This is a good Italian restaurant with a relatively large selection on the menu. The place is actually very big and has a lunch kind of place feel to it. The food was nothing extraordinary but the staff made the experience special. Overall they deserve the 5 star rating based on the price to quality ratio and friendliness of everyone that works there. The counter at the entrance of the place has all kinds of desserts and of course it is very tempting on the way in and especially on the way out."}
{"text":"Unplanned visit and so glad we did! Service is great. A casual place yet food quality is excellent. I'd highly recommend this to friends that work or live in this area. I'm coming back for sure."}
{"text":"Love the casual-ness of the staff. Great service, our server was the chefs wife. Very authentic, amazing food. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Traditional yet not pretentious. The chef/owner from Spagetty Western newest Italian creation does not disappoint. Order the Arancini. Delightful people and food. My heart (and stomach) are full today."}
{"text":"Got sick from their special Valentines menu. Not bad food but okay.  Thought the meat trio chicken too dry and hard."}
{"text":"Wow Kenny at cvs said try Trattoria for dinner.  Nice local spot off the strip. He was so right. Great food, service & atmosphere. Jill & everyone else was fantastic. Thank you for the best dinner of or stay in Vegas."}
{"text":"i've been here a couple of times with my family and have always enjoyed it. the bread knots you get served before your meal comes are SO good i literally can't stop eating them. however the other day i ordered a chicken piccata and one of my chicken breasts wasn't even cooked, was pink and squishy. had my boyfriend inspect it and it was indeed not cooked and we both had a bite of it to really make sure (i didn't want to make them go through the hassle of remaking it) ended up just having them make me one more chicken breast and it came out perfect. i just wish the chicken was cooked more but this place is wonderful."}
{"text":"Amazing place! We had the Margarita Pizza, the Caesars Salad and the Fresh Pappardelle Con Asparagi e Pillo! AMAZING!!! Very nice employees and owners. We will be back and suggest to others. Thank you!"}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant two other times and thoroughly enjoyed it. I've written reviews and called it a \"hidden gem.\" So, with great anticipation we invited our in-laws to share this great dining experience, except it wasn't so great. The bread knots were very good and the Caesar salad was good and large enough to serve 3-4. No complaints there. The rest of the family ordered pasta dishes that included sausage. They liked the hot spicy sausage but overall there wasn't much flavor and they said they would give their dishes a \"four.\" That's not what I had hoped for. Then it came to my dish. I started with the veal cutlet with a Marsala sauce. The cutlet was an almost wafer thin veal slice that was breaded with something that reminded me of breading on something you would find in the freezer section. It was like a fine bread crumble, I'm not sure how to describe it. It just wasn't very good. The flavor was just awful. It tasted like it was cooked in rancid oil. I had my sister-in-law taste it because she once worked in a food research lab. \"What is that flavor?\" She didn't know but she would not eat it. A Marsala sauce, in most places has a very rich flavor but this was was extremely mild and flavorless. Usually when faced with a poor meal like this one I will just suck it up and enjoy the sauce and pasta, but the sauce was not very good. So, on this occasion I did something I have done only a couple times in my life (I'm retired, so that is a lot of years), I sent it back! I ordered Chicken Saltimbocca. My expectations were up, this would be great! Wrong! It too lacked flavor, very bland. The chicken was cooked well and had dollops of cheese on top but there was no other flavor. Usually the sauce and the pasta are the best part, but not on this night. There were no add in flavors like artichoke hearts, prosciutto, mushrooms  sauted onions  or olives. These will give flavor, but when you do not add these types of things and it is just the sauce, you really have to nail the sauce. The Marsala did have mushrooms but it wasn't enough to cover the weakness in the sauce. I have written a glowing review of this place before, but this was like I went to a totally different place. Was there a different cook? Did they change their sauce recipes? Because everyone else gave it a four, I will give it three stars. Based solely on my meals, I would give it a one. The people there are very friendly and I know they take pride in their restaurant, but it is unlikely I will return."}
{"text":"Opening day and can't wait to get back! Great owners and staff and most importantly the food was outstanding. We hate being rushed through our meal and hustled out the door and this was just the opposite. A relaxing dinner with fresh authentic food that was prepared when ordered not 3 days ago. We were very disappointed when Montesanos closed but we've found our new favorite place!!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing!!!! The Italian restaurant in the Golden Nugget has been my favorite for a long time and usually I think no place compares.  I have now found a new favorite!  Don't let this place fool you.  It may be small but the food is so amazing!  You won't be disappointed.  The service was also great.  The staff was very attentive and friendly.  We will be going back regularly."}
{"text":"Very much enjoyed the food. Huge portions too.  The service was pleasant as well. The decor is cute and certainly an upgrade from the pay Italian restaurant that was in their location. Definitely will be trying it again"}
{"text":"Went here today after a friend recommended it. I was not disappointed! What a great experience!   Walked in and was immediately greeted and our group was seated. My mom is on crutches so they were very sweet about making sure our table was comfortable and she could easily access it.   The bread was very good along with the dipping oil. I had the gnocchi which was in this roasted red pepper sauce. It was wonderful! My daughter had the kids macaroni and my mom had the eggplant Parmesan. They even switched out the pasta for fresh veggies with the eggplant.   The food was great and the service was wonderful. They brought my daughter a cookie for dessert and she was so happy. Their pastry case is beyond tempting. We got a Nutella cookie and it was probably one of the best cookies I've ever had!   I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"First time trying this new establishment. Was a frequent guest at Montesanos and was sad to see them go. As some of the previous reviewers have said, I also didn't think anything could replace them, but my expectations have been exceeded. From the complementary bread to the pasta and home made desserts, everything was overall excellent. My group tried the spaghetti and meatballs, eggplant parm and the pizza. The pasta, sauce and cheeses were all very fresh. I wouldn't say the pizza was quite as good as I had hoped, but still very solid. The staff was friendly and accommodating. I will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"I'm really disappointed in this place. I'm all for local businesses, but this one really dropped the ball.  I had ordered their gluten-free pasta a few times in the past, always let them know I had an allergy and all was fine. Last weekend my husband picks up our order, we eat it and about 25 minutes later I get a phone call from them. Someone else had placed the same order with regular pasta around the same time we did, and they gave me their order. WOW! When someone informs you they have a food ALLERGY, you take serious precautions to ensure those allergens are avoided. You don't accidentally give them the wrong order! That aside, I was willing to accept their apology for ruining my Saturday night (which was then spent mostly in the bathroom thanks to their screw up) and refund of my order. Nearly 7 days later I realize the refund still had not been issued. I contacted GrubHub who informed me a refund was not even being processed! GrubHub called them and they said they needed to speak to the owner before issuing my refund, who then said he was going to call me.  I never received a call from him, but I did receive one from Yelp relaying the owner's message that he wanted to see how severe my reaction was before issuing the refund!!!!!! Are you freakin kidding me!? I explained it to the Yelp employee and was then finally issued a refund. I can't believe I had to even explain to someone the level of my allergy to justify a refund of an INCORRECT ORDER! I understand mistakes happen but when it comes to food allergies in the restaurant business, mistakes  CANNOT happen! On top of that, the way this restaurant went about their own mistake was all kinds of awful. It's just not worth it in my opinion."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch.  No one was at the front counter to greet us so we ended up seating ourselves. After seating ourselves, still no one acknowledge us. 2 guys seating at a table and 1 guy standing, talking in italian, guy standing saw us and still continue to conversate. Still waiting and nothing..got up and left amd took our business here at ventano"}
{"text":"This was our first visit, it will not be our last. My wife had Lasagne and it was really good. The sauce was mild and the noodles had a perfect consistency. Even though I'm not usually a lasagne fan I would order this in the future. We split a large Caesar salad which would have served four people. There was a slight hint of anchovies but it was so mild it might just be my imagination. Basically, it was a very good dressing. They also served little knots of bread. Ours came out of the oven pipping hot. The olive oil had a hint of garlic which was too strong for my wife, I loved it.  Had the chicken Cacciatore which came with a side of angel hair pasta. The flavor was very good but there were too many red and green peppers. They needed to add a few mushrooms. Despite my seeming criticism, I'd order it again without hesitation. This place is a definite find and will be our number 1 Italian Restaurant. The only criticism is the service. Our server was observed working 9 tables so we had to wait a while for our check. Another server took pity on us and brought our bill. But, one of the cooks ran all the entrees out of the kitchen to the tables so our food arrived fresh and hot. I've never seen this but I loved it. Don't hesitate to give this place a try."}
{"text":"Not a day goes by that I don't thoroughly appreciate some of the authentic, Italian owned gems we have in Henderson. This wonderful place most certainly qualifies (despite having spaghetti with meatballs and fettuccine Alfredo on the menu.) From the generous antipasti to the perfectly cooked home made pasta and dolci, this jewel is one of my favorites. They even have arancini! (a true Sicilian specialty)."}
{"text":"Went today after seeing good reviews from lots of Sun City Anthem neighbors.  I had the best chicken cattiatore ever!  The bread and olive oil with herbs were also delicious!  Portions are large, just finished the second half of my meal at home.  I told my husband that I will be dreaming of this dish and can't wait to go back!!!"}
{"text":"Finally a local Italian place you can actually enjoy, without driving to the Strip! The pizza is outstanding here, in addition to many of their dishes. My preference is the eggplant and the lasagna; yes, I'm a traditionalist when it come to Italian food, but what can I tell you after coming from NY! No pineapple on my food here!!   My kids love their cannoli's and this is the excuse to come here. Their baked desserts remind me of the ones my next door neighbor used to baked on the weekends, back in NY. So, that should tell you a lot to why I come to Trattoria Italia. Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"In a word, EXCELLENT!  Great food, service, ambiance, portion sizes and price.  Can't ask for more!"}
{"text":"I ordered the salmon my server Jill suggested and it was absolutely amazing!! Extremely impressed with food and service. Will be back soon"}
{"text":"We went for dinner with friend's on NYE. The food was good, except for the my husband's order was wrong. The service from beginning to end was horrible.   We had to reach out to our server to get our drinks. We never got bread when every table around us did. When the meal came I realized I was not getting my soup :(  The food was good but it was not very hot. We then ordered coffee and that was not hot. We did receive a comped desert of cookies and mini cannoli's. The table agreed that was the best part of this experience.   When my husband received the check the server told us that she said she was sorry once already. She then took $9.00 off the check.   All my husband's customers had good things to say. We had high hopes. We were good customer's of Montesanto's. I hope they get their act together.  I grew up in the restaurant business in South Florida and they need to make some changes."}
{"text":"Always excellent service from Jill and all the staff. Outstanding food. Love the eggplant parm and the veal parm. Huge and delicious meatballs. Oversize portions make perfect lunch the next day. Make reservations!"}
{"text":"The food and service were both excellent - exceeded expectations.  I had the Insalata Italia and it was big, fresh and the dressing was light yet tasty. After that the spaghetti with meatballs were delicious. No room for desert this time, but they looked amazing."}
{"text":"I was out with friends who have recently moved to town and wanted to get Italian. So I let them to my favorite Italian restaurant. I did a triple take when my beloved Montesanos was not there.  So naturally we wanted Italian food so what a perfect time to try the new local Italian restaurant.  And I'm very happy that we did. We were greeted and seated by one of the owners named Pascal?  We were served by his sister whose Name Escapes Me but who had a lovely personality and attentive service. There were four in our party and we all ordered different dishes. The chicken alfredo , sausage and peppers sandwich , lasagna, followed by hand filled cannoli.  Everyone agreed their food was excellent. I'm so happy that the family-owned restaurant I lost has been replaced by a family-owned restaurant I am certain I will come to love.  It truly feels to me like a newer version of one of my old favorites.  Thank you for a wonderful dining experience, excellent service, and relaxed atmosphere.  Not only will I be back, but I will bring more friends and family!  Please forgive any grammatical errors as I did this review on my voice app. :-)"}
{"text":"Amazing! Amazing! Amazing! Bravo! The vodka sauce is EXTREMELY hard to put down when you have them with garlic knots. The lobsta ravioli is one of if not THE best ravioli dishes in Las Vegas. The service was great and they keep the place looking authentic but not run down. The fried rice balls with marinara was an awesome appetizer. Total bill for 2 with glass of wine each and app was $60. Such a great place, will definitely return!"}
{"text":"I took my family to dinner there to celebrate a birthday. I want to start by saying our server Jill was outstanding from start to finish . Its hard to say what left a better impression , the food or JiIl !! We started with some calamari, meatballs, and Clams and Mussels Vongole , all delicious . We ordered Ckn parm , eggplant Parm , Lobster ravioli, and the kids Mac n Cheese . Everything was delicious and large portions . The restaurant is very affordable and a great family environment"}
{"text":"Family owned. Excellent service. Excellent food. Excellent prices. I've had the meatball sub, lasagna, and several desserts; everything has been great. By far the best Italian restaurant in the area."}
{"text":"Always on a lookout for good Italian and I am so happy that Trattoria Italia has opened up where Montesano's used to be, and glad that it is creating some great dishes.  After about 4 months, we have been waiting to come here.  I like the menu and their flexibility as well.  1. Pasta - The wife ordered the Gnocchi with meat sauce and she really liked it.  I liked it as well, as the Gnocchi was both firm and tender and the meat sauce was very tasty.  They serve a very nice full serving and she brought some home for leftovers, there was so muhc.  I tried the Fettuccini aglio e olio with vegetables and asked for Vegan style, since my daughter is vegan and I was gonna give her some leftovers.  This was a fantastic dish. The fettuccini is home made, al dente, and the mix of garlic and oil was just right.  I really enjoyed the simple taste.  The veggies were cooked perfectly and very tasty as well.  I did not leave as much for her as leftovers as I intended...  2.  The pizza - ordered a large Pizza Capricchiosa, mozzerella, tomato sauce, artichokes, olives, ham and mushroom.  This was an excellent pizza, the mix of ingredients were just right.  The pizza crust was fairly firm and i was able to grasp it with one hand, fold it and bite into it the way i like to eat pizza.    3.  Caprese and Garlic Knots - We ordered the Insalata Caprese to start and the mozzarella and tomatoes were fresh, and mixed with oil and balsamic just the right way.  We enjoyed this very much.  The garlic knots were so fresh and so easy to eat.  I am afraid that if you don't control yourself, you will end up eating way too much.  We brought a lot of the food home, as we were really sampling what they had.  We also enjoyed their Pinot Grigio and Chardonnay.  The espresso coffee was also great.   All in all, a good place, good price and great service from everyone there.  I will be back."}
{"text":"Heaven!! What a great new find!! neighborhood type place (even though it's on stupid crazy busy Eastern) with fabulous food! Our waiter, Daniel was super nice and just attentive \"enough\".. didn't hover but did seem to know when to check-in. We each had a special, Shrimp in pesto w/ pappardelle was INSANELY DELICIOUS! Osso bucco was also VERY yummy! Tiramisu was SPOT ON!!  Generous portions of excellent food. Can't wait to go back and try their other dishes. This is the real deal for casual Italian dining!! Everyone's treated like family! Just what you want in an Italian restaurant. We were in shorts & t-shirts as were many others, but there were also people dressed in dressier date night attire, so I imagine anything goes.  Ohh. We also had meatball appetizer and they were done to perfection - served In a nice sweet \"gravy\". Very tender, perfectly put together... just firm enough to not fall apart/not \"overworked\". Cesar salad was simple and tasty, with just the right amount of dressing. Croutons were crispy and delicate. Garlic knots that accompanied meal were tasty too (not dripping in oil like some places). That said, their olive oil dipping sauce was YUMMY too. Yeah. We will be BACK!!"}
{"text":"Trattoria Italia was an absolutely wonderful first time experience. The service and the food were excellent. It's so nice to have an authentic Italian restaurant in the neighborhood with such warm welcoming owners. We will be making this our favorite eating place! Thank you to the owners!"}
{"text":"I was in town with my daughters soccer team for a tournament. I called them last min and asked if they could seat out team of 20. They said sure so we headed over. We arrived right about closing time and they had everything ready for us. We choose family style and it was AMAZING. The food was so good! And it was fast to our table.. which the starving soccer team was so thankful for! We had a very long day and this was the perfect ending!"}
{"text":"Almost done right, true Italian style. The bread could be more of a baguette rather than rolls. We ordered the Spaghetti Amatriciana and Lasanga. Both were very freshly cooked but, the recipe lacked true Italian authenticity. (We lived in Italy for 3 years). Our advice, stick with true Italian recipes without adding the American spices and flairs."}
{"text":"Stopped by tonight after the wait for BJ's was almost an hour. Saw that this was a new place, so decided to try it out!  First, was served cold tap water. Bleh. Vegas water is gross lol We were greeted by a very nice server (I wish I had taken down her name!) After hearing the specials, I ordered the eggplant parm, my husband ordered the chicken parm, and my little one got spaghetti.   My little one wanted my angel hair pasta that came with mine instead of her own spaghetti, so I got to eat her meatballs. Yum! The eggplant parm was really yummy! My husband said his chicken parm was really good too.   For desert, I had an almond cookie, my husband had a canolli, and the baby had an almond desert with a cherry on top. All were really good!   Only complaint I have is that the kids meals are way overpriced. $8 for spaghetti is crazy."}
{"text":"Really nice place and great food. Definitely comfort food! My mom had one of the salads and it looked absolutely stunning! Such FRESH vegetables. My dad and I had some pasta. Excellent! I would definitely recommend this to anyone who needs some comfort food or a great Italian meal. Well done!"}
{"text":"This place is a must check out if you haven't already! My grandma had taken my mom here for dinner recently and they both were talking about how great it was. It's super close to my house so one night my mom decided she wanted to take my husband and I here for dinner and chose this place. It was terrific! The staff was very friendly and the place is put together very well. We all enjoyed our delicious dinner and even had a ton of food leftover to take home. My mom ordered a huge house salad and their house wine, my husband ordered the pesto gnocchi , and I ordered a penne pasta with marinara for my daughter and I. Everything was extraordinary! I'm craving their food now as I type this! A must check out if you haven't already! Can't wait to go back again soon!!"}
{"text":"Substantially poorer quality as compared to the restaurant that was previously in the same location - Montesano's."}
{"text":"This place is legit. I am not really into Italian food but this place made me love Italian food. The place is located sort of strip mall and from outside, it looks nothing extraordinary but taste they offer is whole different league.  Everything tastes homemade and I think they actually make everything from scratch.    We had Carbonara with Chicken and Bolognese with meat sauce and both dishes were best Italian food I've had in my life.  Carbonara was really on point especially for me, because that Pancetta fat was like heaven on earth.  We also grabbed some Cannolis on our way out and we regret so much we didn't grab a dozen of them.  I can't wait to go back to Vegas and visit here again.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Love this place! The food is delicious and the service is fast I always make a phone order and it's usually ready in 10 min... which is very convenient when you are at work and you want to grab something fast and delicious not just a fast food. Totally recommend this place one of the best Italian restaurants in vegas"}
{"text":"My new favorite place for reasonably priced Italian food. Their pasta a la vodka and their ravioli are excellent. I've also enjoyed the garlic knots before. Generous portions and friendly service as well."}
{"text":"We were heartbroken when our favorite small Italian spot closed but now it has been replaced by Trattoria Italia and oh my it is fabulous.  I have now eaten there 3 times and it has been wonderful every time.  The antipasto misto is delicious and freshly prepared.  Their lasagna is great with meat sauce.  Their salads are nice and crisp.  Spaghetti and meatballs was a traditional Italian plate and was delicious.  It's small and adorable with baked goodies galore ."}
{"text":"Love the place, the ambience, food, everything! My favorite place to go to when I'm craving for some authentic italian food"}
{"text":"I live in NYC and visit my parents in Henderson often always disappointed with the food out here. It's far from what I'm used to in NYC. We tried Trattoria Italia and it is AMAZING! Friendly, delicious, and reminded me of home. If you want nyc style Italian food in a casual environment... eat here! Love it! Will return often."}
{"text":"Lobster Ravioli w/Vodka sauce. First time here, had appetizer plate with Fried Calamari, fried zucchini and shrimp. Pasta fagioli. Food is very tasty and Took some cannoli home for desert, meal portions are good size. Will be back to try more items on the menu, recommend it for sure."}
{"text":"Recently visited Trattoriia Italia on a vacation to Vegas, and we will definitely be back. For an appetizer we order the fried mozzarella balls, how can you go wrong with fried cheese! The tomato sauce for dipping was so delicious. Our entrees were gnocchi and fettuccine alfredo. The gnocchi was soft and delicious, it came with a trio of sauces, the pesto was by far my favorite. My son had the fettuccine and all but licked the bowl, and this boy's a pasta expert! The best part of the meal was the incredible tiramisu. Our server told us that the owner's dad makes it fresh every morning, and you could tell. It was creamy and so very rich and delicious. Save room for dessert!!! The servers were kind, knowledgeable and made us feel welcome. Can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"Super excited to try this new Italian restaurant since it is so close to home. Excellent service and the food did not disappoint. For how large the portions are, the food is very reasonably priced. My husband and I both had enough for 2 full servings of leftovers. Pasquale, the owner, was so nice and accommodating. Sent us a special dish and also their tiramisu and cannolis to finish off our delicious meal.  Our server was sweet and super attentive. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Our new favorite Italian restaurant. Great family restaurant, the staff is friendly and the food is great. They just opened a few weeks ago and they are busy already. I guess word travels fast when there is a new favorite restaurant in your neighborhood."}
{"text":"The food was ok. Not great. Service was awful!! Our server did not offer us drinks. Came up asked if we wanted to order. We did and he walked away before we could ask for drinks. I tried to continually flag him for a drink order. I finally got his attention. There was a gnat or something in my drink. Never got it replaced. My husband and daughter never got a refill. The server ignored us. Then a family of 7 came in and he gave them water. Took drink orders and told them specials. We didn't know there were specials. And during this time we were one of two tables until the daily of 7 came in. Service was just plain bad"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious and great service! The canoli was the best I have ever had! We love going to can't owned restaurants and this one did not disappoint! I wish we had more like this around!"}
{"text":"I would find it hard to believe anyone eating at this amazing restaurant would give it anything less then 5 stars. Tonight our group enjoyed a fabulous dinner. We all had something different with dishes from lasagna to lobster ravioli and all in between. No need to go anywhere else to have great italian food."}
{"text":"Tonight I decided to order our dinner and have it delivered. I used the GrubHub app for delivery. Lasagna , Meatballs and a Fettuccine pasta with cherry tomatoes and olive oil. Very easy process to order thru the app. Food arrived as promised on time. The problems as I see them are this. Carry out package is simple foil tins with paper tops. Really not designed to keep food warm and leak free. The Grubhub folks use the standard insulated bags for transport. The time to get to my house from the restaurant is literally 15 minutes tops. Well the food had to be reheated and the lasagna leaked thru the top lid. So many new modern to- go type containers are available that are microwave friendly. I recommend that they use this type. Sure they cost a bit more but add on the price for carry out. They already do. The food my guess wasnt that hot when the delivery guy showed up to get the order. Quality was average. I prefer Buon Gusto or Bootlegger. Just saying"}
{"text":"I know everyone gave 5 Stars and I am glad you had a great experience with greta food, but we did not nor the table next to us. We want to like this place as the previous Resteraunt was one of our all time favorites. The owners are very nice and helpful I will give them that. They work the dining room well checking on things. We sat at a middle table looking into the wait station. We sat for 10 minutes before we were told who our server would be but I guess they forgot to tell her. Lots of staff in the dining room running around but no one stopped to check on us for the 10 minutes. When we were approached we ordered an appetizer and a glass of wine and for another 10 minutes no wine to the table as everyone kept working the POS computer for orders. We stopped one of the openers who handled the wine delivery. Mozzarella balls were very good and I had the Seafood Pasta which was very good and hot. Wife had the Eggplant park which the outer layer was hot but the interior was ice cold. Not a good fist experience but I hope they will get better and we will try again. They did deduct the eggplant from the final bill which is admirable. What I noticed is that there is an over abundance of staff on the floor but all doing different things at the same tables. The Server who delivered the food kept getting the tables wrong or brining the wrong meal to a table. Again I hope that in time they fall into a rhythm. The table next to us had the same issues with service and order delivery so it was not just us this evening. We did how ever receive a free dessert which was also very good. We will be back and hopefully my next review will be in the 5 star range"}
{"text":"Ate here the other night with family and it was great. Everything we had was delicious. We started with some appetizers. Calamari was one of the best calamari dishes I have had. Caprese Salad, the addition of salad to this is a perfect touch. The best appetizer we had was the eggplant. Mouth watering! Our entrees did not disappoint either. We ordered the chicken parmigiana, cannelloni, linguine pesto and a pepperoni pizza. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Good food, good atmpsphere.  Was in henderson so asked my co worker for recomendation and he didnt steer me wrong.  Will be back if im out this way again."}
{"text":"I cannot even wait till finish the meal and I must give a 5 star review!   Their calamari is sooo good with big shrimps in them!! A very nice gentleman told me that in Italy they eat their calamari with lemon only, the tomato sauce is just a big demand from the state :) , anyways, they are delicious!   For my main course I ordered Gnocchi, this is my first time. I love it! The pasta itself is soooo tasty! I can't really describe it, very rich and tatsty.   The only \"downside\" (not really) is that their portion is HUGE! Neither me nor my husband finished our entry. And my leftover is literally a regular Togo order portion lol!   Too bad this place is not anywhere close to my home."}
{"text":"Third time eating here. Food is consistently good. Tried the penne bolognese...very good. My wife had a chicken dish ....also very good will try the meatballs next time Very much like you might find in little italy in new york if you get past the strip mall location."}
{"text":"I've been craving for alfredo since NY and I was near the place so might as well go. FOOD DID NOT DISAPPOINT. However I did see my fork wasn't washed very well and had some food on the back of it plus when I opened the napkin there were bread crumbs. I'll be back though, hopefully with a clean fork next time."}
{"text":"Deliciousness.............  we enjoyed all that we ordered.  The bread knots are yummmmmm yummmmm .  We definataly will be back we found out Italian food fix"}
{"text":"Delicious!!! The energy from the staff was loving and warm, the food was immaculate and it was busy! A very good sign. We had reservations on a Saturday night, they do a great business at being attentive. The seafood I had was very fresh, along with the tasty antipasti! DEFINITELY make your way into here. Oh! And they're very clean hehe! Caio! Gratzi!"}
{"text":"This place was absolutely delicious and the way that this restaurant was decorated is so cute! How can you put your fork down with a pasta this good? I'm glad we came here today because we're definitely going to come more often. Thank goodness it's just down the street! If I can rate 5 or more stars, then I would."}
{"text":"Really enjoy the atmosphere, food and service! They make a wonderful tiramisu and lots of other desserts. Every dish from appetizers to entrees were great. Ate here several times. Try the special seafood pasta, calamari and salads. All great, they never dissapoint. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Not a bad place for some Italian food.  The atmosphere and decor are not very Italian.   The chairs, tables, floors are very low end for the prices of entrees.    The food was not bad but nothing really stood out as outstanding.  The cost of the meal warranted either better food or a stellar atmosphere.    There are better Italian places to go to for the money.  But, this place isn't terrible.  If you are in the area and hanker for Italian, you could do worse."}
{"text":"After finding this restaurant on yelp with great reviews, my husband and I decide to stop in for lunch. Let me start off by saying, the food is great. We ordered the baked pasta and a Cesar salad. Now the downfall. This is the first Italian restaurant, that didn't order bread when first sitting down. Originally our order included the bowl of the minestrone. We let the guy who took our order that we would like our salad and soup before the pasta. At least 15 minutes go by and here comes our baked pasta which was great cause it came out so fast, but we never got our salad and soup. The lady who brought out the pasta said she would check on it. She took our pasta away and then the guy who had taken our order came out and apologized for the mix up and then told me that they didn't have any minestrone soup. 20 minutes now after we put in our original order, you just now tell us you don't have something we had order. Long story short, the food was great. The service was horrible!! Definitely will not be going back here just because the service was so bad!! It's really to bad cause we really enjoyed the food!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best little Italian restaurants that I have been to in Vegas. Quickly becoming a favorite spot for my friends and I. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. They have really good authentic Italian food. I've always went to a different Italian place that is a little farther but they have went downhill so I decided to give it a try one night with my family. Everything was delicious and everyone loved what they ordered.  They have complimentary garlic knots which are so good! The service is really nice and everyone is super friendly.  I ordered the chicken Marsala and I was not disappointed. It tasted authentic and amazing; there isn't anything bad I can say! We also tried chicken Alfredo, seafood risotto, and a pizza. They have a lot of pastry's and desserts that I didn't get to try but they looked very good. Definitely give this place a try and see what you think!"}
{"text":"Super authentic Italian food. Service was great. All of my kids said it was the best pizza they've ever had in their entire lives. A little bit on the pricey side for the portion size but definitely high up in quality."}
{"text":"First time here, wont be my last!! Thank you to the owner who catered to our party of 20.  He personally made sure every course was great, drinks were filled, table was cleaned often, and delivered a personal experience."}
{"text":"Loved the authentic Italian food and staff -- this place is legit!  We started with fried mozzarella balls and caprese insalata.  Both were just perfect!  I had the lasagna and my husband had the fettuccine Alfredo and we nearly had to roll ourselves out of the place -- we were so stuffed!  But our bellies were very happy and we will definitely be back again.  In fact we came back a couple hours after dinner to grab a few pastries to take home for dessert."}
{"text":"Great food amazing staff our food came out so fresh it was still smoking hot it was a great environment loved every thing about it. Doesn't look like much from the location but never judge a book by its cover the food and desserts are amazing"}
{"text":"My family and I have been here twice just this month! It's excellent food with great portions. From the appetizers to pizza to pasta, it has all been great! So glad to have a new and delicious Italian restaurant close by that won't break the bank."}
{"text":"Has to be the best Italian spot in vegas. I've been to Italy multiple times and I could swear this food is straight from Italy! :)"}
{"text":"Wow wow wow. Amazing food, adorable ambiance, great staff. Definitely a new favorite!"}
{"text":"This place is a great hole in the wall in henderson area. There food is authentic and there service is even better. There bread is so yummy! We will be back for more!!!"}
{"text":"Good all the way around. Used Yelp to find something in the area we found ourselves in, and wow! We would have settle for a disappointment just to quickly find something to eat, but we really scored! I had the baked penne with marinara bolognese sauce, which is one of the best I have eating in a resturant.   Even if you are just kinda feeling like Italian, don't think, just head over."}
{"text":"like any other small family own Italian restaurant  Friend service of course that they own business of course they're going to get a lot of 5 starts because have a personalized service than other places organization they need a little bit more yeah not too many people got that welcome on the tables are too close together is half of the server not to be taking an order putting your butt in other people's faces pasta dishes are quite large we had a pizza like any other Pizza any other place except for Domino's of course LOL the next door is empty space that might be a good idea if the rental place to to have enough room and the place looks like a regular restaurant"}
{"text":"Changing my review from 5 star to 2.  Looks like there may have been an owner change. Servers are RUDE.  Guy at the register is equally rude.  Bread was served burnt.  My 9 year old order spaghetti and meatballs off the kids menu. They brought her the adult order.   $80 for 3. Food is good if you can get past the rude"}

{"text":"I absolutely LOVE this place! I was hesitant on writing a review for here because I love the feeling of it being a small hidden gem but that's just selfish so here is my review:   The party I was with ordered the Chicken Alfredo, Spaghetti with meatballs, chicken caprese and garlic knots. Everything we ordered was delicious, you could tell the sauces were home made because of how good and flavorful it was. The bread was so good I could only imagine it was made from scratch. The environment was also very enjoyable, the waiters were all very friendly and helpful. Such a great place I will definitely be going back for either date nights or with the whole family."}
{"text":"If you woke up here you would swear you were in Italy! A nice family run trattoria where everyone speaks Italian and makes you feel at home, very authentic.   We were greeted by the owners daughter, and served by her husband and brother. Bread rolls and water were brought while we looked at the menu. They also have several wines from Italy and Sicily by the glass which is nice.   We started with the pasta e fagioli soup which was delicious. A large bowl filled with cannellini beans, pasta and chunks of pancetta. A 5 star soup!   For our entrees we ordered the eggplant parmesan and the gnocchi with pesto and gorgonzola which is made in house. The waiter asked if we wanted a salad and I asked if they had a SMALL side salad. He said yes. A few minutes later a HUGE salad was brought out that could have easily fed 4 people. It was loaded with roasted red peppers, artichoke hearts, buffalo mozzarella, olives, tomato and red onion. Although it was very good, I was a little upset I was brought a $9 dinner salad when I asked for a small side salad. A misunderstanding? I hope so.   The entrees came out and both were very large portions. You definitely get your moneys worth here, as well as leftovers for lunch the next day :)  The eggplant parm was big and covered in cheese. Served with a  side of spaghetti there was plenty to take home. The gnocchi were also very good, melted in my mouth. The sauce was very heavy and very rich, I could barely finish half of it.   The atmosphere here is genuine Italian Trattoria and with all of the friendly staff speaking Italian it is really an authentic experience."}
{"text":"Such a wonderful wonderful meal and experience.It was my family's first time coming here. It's so much bigger on the inside than appears outside. Such a cute and warm establishment. I shared a chicken parmigiana and it was more than enough. My mom had minestrone and it was some of the best I've ever had. I can tell this is such an authentic Italian meal. The owner was present and interacts with guests. Great customer service. They accidentally brought the wrong order out to our table and ended comping our dessert. Can't wait to come back! Great place for an intimate or family dinner."}
{"text":"This is usually our go-to Italian restaurant. Normally I would give it four and a half stars but I've had to change that because the latest meal there the chicken parm was tough as leather. And the arugula salad was mediocre.  The Chianti was very nice though!"}
{"text":"Staff are friendly and helpful. Casual ambience and easy parking. Food was nothing special."}
{"text":"Just had dinner at this spot. Our server Danny was awesome at recommending dinner options. The antipasto and the Mediterranean Linguini is what we got and it was amazing. The place is nice and cozy, great ambiance. We will be back!"}
