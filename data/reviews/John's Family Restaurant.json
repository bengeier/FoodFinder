{"text":"Saw a post on FB has anybody been to John's wondering why is parking lot full which usually means something good is happening inside. Then my hair stylist said she highly recommended eating there. So my daughter her boyfriend and myself went for lunch.The decor is simple nothing fancy very casual dining.  Our server was friendly and appeared happy at work.  My daughter and I ordered chicken souvlaki which was served with rice and potatoes the chicken was tender and tasty the potatoes and rice was good can I just mention a very generous plate. Her boyfriend a football player chose chicken fingers and fries he said he enjoyed alot the chicken fingers were huge and must have been 6 or more on top of heeping pile of freshly cut perfectly cooked fries.
I have been back 2 times since and enjoyed breakfast and lunch also
It's the type of restaurant where they have regulars walk in and they know them by name kinda cool in this way too busy world we live in."}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant. Ate here over 30 times. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"The hubby and I tried this place out a few days ago after driving by often and seeing the parking lot full. I typically try and stay away from anything with the word 'diner' in it but was pleasantly surprised. The service was impeccable, our waitress was so lovely and the the food came out quickly and hot. The portions are HUGE! My hubby had the strawberry waffle and I had eggs, bacon, home fries and pancakes and only finished half of it at best but it was delicious! Would definitely go back and recommend it to others just make sure you go hungry!"}
{"text":"Took my little sister out for brunch here for the first time amazing food and very friendly staff. Definitely worth the money we spent, it's a perfect place for Sunday family brunch."}
{"text":"My wife and I visited John's Family Restaurant for dinner tonight.  We both ordered something different for our entrees but our sides were the same.  I ordered the sirloin and she had the roast beef.  We both had mash potatoes and broccoli.  We both agreed that the mash potatoes needed work, too watery.  The broccoli was ok for the most part.  The steak was ok but had too much fat on it.  My wife said that the roast was good, didn't have to use a knive to cut it, it was that tender.

We ordered dessert.  I got the coconut cream pie and she got the pumpkin pie.  We both enjoyed the cream pie, good amount of coconut to cream filling.  The pumpkin pie was a little salty but good.

Overall, we will probably go back but will try other things.  The service was good and the table was clean when we were seated."}
{"text":"So happy to finally have a great breakfast place in Brampton  .... i have been there quite a few times to eat breakfast and as a server / bartender being in the business i have to say service is great atmosphere is great very welcoming place to be  thumbs up 5 stars . I recommend John's to all my friends"}
{"text":"If I was rating this restaurant on service alone it would easily be 5 stars. So genuinely friendly and welcoming! I can't remember the last time we were treated so well in a restaurant. 
The food was well prepared and tasted good. Basic breakfast. But the coffee was great and so piping hot! That made me very happy. 
It did feel like a longer than average wait for our food but that may also have been because we were in a rush."}
{"text":"Food is fantastic! I have never had an issue with this place before. Service is always great and food is always very tasty. This is a super busy breakfast place so make sure you show up early if you don't want to wait for a table. Food portions are huge for the price you pay, very good value. 

Egg's Benedict are fantastic
Chicken Slovakia is really good to.  

I will continue to come back here."}
{"text":"One of my fave places for breakfast in Brampton. I usually get the salmon Benedict which is always good. Comes with potatoes and side fruit. The fruit selection is always good. I've had the Pemeal bacon Benedict but not a fan of the bacon. Friends have tried the asparagus and Swiss Benedict and said it was really good. If you get the deluxe breakfast the sausage is good too. Haven't had lunch there yet."}
{"text":"Good southern country cooking , great prices nice sized portions I had grilled salmon , collard greens, coconut pie delicious .
."}
{"text":"Another outstanding dinner at John's! Kitchen was a little backed up Sunday night, but our waitress kept us up to date and the food was well worth the wait! We've never had anything but great meals at John's!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Great place to spot for a quick, good lunch. I love to come in here because they are quick, friendly and the amount of food for the price is perfect! Sweet tea is good but my favorite lunch item is their Roast Turkey & Dressing $7.50. I don't know why but it is always perfect!!!"}
{"text":"We came in minutes before closing and they gladly took us in when they didn't have to.  The service was second to none and the food was excellent.   We will be going back for sure."}
{"text":"Bland, boring food slopped on a plate with lackluster service cannot be made up for with huge portions.  Give me less, make it tasty and treat me better!"}
{"text":"Meh. I'm not from Charlotte and the whole Greek family restaurant thing in every nook and cranny mystified me so u thought I'd try a few. Weirdly not Greek. More kinda southern comfort food than anything else. Chicken tips were my order with double pickled beets. Not bad but not amazing either. I'd love it if it was more Greek but I'm assuming it's not a big moneymaker based on the clientele. Lots of workmen from this industrial side of town filling their tummies for 10 bucks. The waitress was very sweet and got me a to go diet coke...they put a \"cup\" charge on the bill of 25 cents which gave me the giggles. Lots of plants (most real), worn carpet and typical vinyl booths. Seemed clean, just old."}
{"text":"I was not impressed with the food. I ordered a salad , steak , and mashed potatoes. I received my salad which had about 1/4 cup of water on the bottom of the plate. The mashed potatoes were grossly runny. And I wish restaurants would quit serving ice tea in plastic as the tea picks up the plastic taste. The only thing I found alittle enjoyable is the steak had some good flavor."}
{"text":"Came here for a Saturday Breakfast/Brunch with a girlfriend around 10:30am.

we were greeted and our name was placed on a list to be seated.

After waiting about 20 minutes we got seated at what looked like a nice clean booth, but when I left I realized there was ample food stuck to the bottom of my boots.

we had asked the server for mimosas - they don't sell them!!!!!!

going on, we placed our order. I got my go too - eggs benny and my friend got the scrambled eggs with bread and order the bacon on the side for me. (she doesn't eat bacon & told the waitress this) the food came out with the bacon on the same plate as the eggs and the bread. we had to send it back, and what we assumed happened is they took the bacon off the plate and put it on another one just to bring it back out minutes later. that's not right - when we asked she said it was fresh, which I'm sorry to say I highly doubt and for that reason I have to give this place a one star. that's like saying im allergic to something and the waitress not listening.. not impressed."}
{"text":"We visited this restaurant for breakfast while reuniting with family in Brampton. We had a party of 11 and they took great care of us. We waited a little longer for the food than we expected but that was probably our fault because our party arrived at different times. The staff here is super friendly and the food was great! The value for the price is great as well. I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Stopped by for breakfast for the first time and enjoyed my choice which was the western omelette with home fries, toast and fruit. Portions are decent and it was done well, home fries could have been more well done/browned to my liking but it was ok. My dining companion had the corned beef hash with poached eggs, toast, home fries and fruit. They were pleased with their choice , eggs were perfectly poached and corned beef hash was on point. Service was efficient and friendly. Would I come back? Yes, it warrants another visit, but I'd try something different as there were a lot of options vying for my attention."}
{"text":"One of the best family restaurants in Brampton very clean with friendly service I had the penne a la vodka it was amazing it has bacon spinach and mushrooms with whole cloves of yummy roasted garlic that melts in your mouth I also added shrimp and they were massive my mom had fettuccine Alfredo she said it's the best she has ever had topped with grilled chicken every one needs to try this place"}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast with my dad today. It was very delicious. Menu is great and the food came out fresh. I had the eggs Benedict and it was so fresh. Most of their menu comes with a side of homefries and fresh fruit. My father had the half and half (comes with 3 eggs, bacon and sausage with toast plus the aforementioned sides). Everything was great and our server was very friendly and attentive. Would come back."}
{"text":"I've been eating at John's all of my life and it is still as good as it was 20 years ago. I work right around the corner so I eat at John's about 3 to 4 times a way because you can always get something different. 

Beef Tips are spot on as well as Fried Squash. it is a must try in Southwest Charlotte

Bubba"}
{"text":"Great portions , reasonably priced, friendly staff.
The John's famous pasta is out of this world, the liver and onions is a close 2nd . 
Recommend for breakfast, lunch or dinner!"}
{"text":"Been by John's twice this last week and was throughly delighted with both visits!  They are about the only place around to get real home cooking.  
     They give you a small serving of real, homemade potato soup.  They have a main course with two sides, and the \"sides\" list includes such items as banana pudding, so you can have a small desert if you don't want one of the big pie slices you see as you come in the door.  
     Prices are reasonable; my roasted chicken with dressing, with sweet potato casserole and cooked apples tonight were less than $9.00.
     They're my favorite place around!"}
{"text":"I have gone to John's a number of times.  Let me be very clear that the food here is excellent.  However during the past six months I have noticed a significant decline in service. If there is a concern raised, there is always a snippy response.  Case in point on my last visit we waiting for 47 minutes for our food.  The reason I know this is because the waitress who took our order told us this when we said that we have had to wait for about an hour.  We were also told this was because I ordered a chicken skewer with my Greek salad.  I really do not think it is appropriate to respond to someone that they have waited almost an hour to say that it has not been an hour it has only been forty seven minutes and I know this because I have the time the order was taken on my ipad.  Someone interested in my patronage would be more likely to respond with I'm sorry it has taken so long we are backed up in the kitchen.

I have tried more than once to ignore the bad service here.  However I cannot do so.

The food is excellent - consider getting it to go or through ubereats ."}
{"text":"Love this place. It is my go to for homecooked good. The food is always amazing and service is fantastic!!! My favorite so far are thr beef tips and rice."}
{"text":"I've been going to John's with my family since I was a kid, and it hasn't failed me yet.

Southern comfort food as it should be. A variety of tasty entrees with a list of delicious sides to choose from. Always served with a biscuit or cornbread. If you go for dinner, they'll also give you a complimentary (yep, a free) bowl of the soup of the day with your meal. A rarity this day and age, for sure.

John's is not going to be your fancy place, or a spot with a crazy fly atmosphere, but it's not trying to be. It's good, affordable food served by nice folks."}
{"text":"A lot can change in two years and it did, regrettably. Two years ago $15 got you a large portion of meat, a Greek salad, roast potatoes and rice. Today, it's $14 for half the meat on stale pita with nondescript fries.
 Move along...nothing to see [or eat] here."}
{"text":"After yelping for nearby breakfast spots we found johns.   We were greeted nicely and given our choice of seats right away.  The menu is big but not too big to make it a hard choice.  My husband ordered chicken breast with breakfast and french toast on the side and I had the traditional eggs and bacon brekky.  Well my husband had a feast.  Two large chicken breasts with home fries toast 3 eggs cooked perfectly as well as french toast!  It was funny watching him try to eat it all for principals. I thought my meal was great and well worth the $11 price.  We were stuffed and the bill was very reasonable.  The waitstaff were very friendly and attentive.  Unlike the sunrise chain where it's always a line up, crowded and chaotic, and you are grossly overcharged for basic extras, this place was quiet and calm on a Sunday morning.  My only beef with the place is the itty bitty mugs they give you for your tea.  Boo!!"}
{"text":"If flavor is important to you- this may not be the place.  The fried mushroom and squash appetizer needed salt, hot sauce, and prayer . The staff is very friendly. I will come back but I will have to order differently."}
{"text":"It was our first time at John's. great service and amazing food. Best egg florentine I have had in a long time. Will surely come again."}
{"text":"I have been here a couple times my wife wanted to try it out. The food is cheap and you get large portions but is pretty mediocre and bland. It is just not a place I want to go spend my money at with all the great resturants in the Charlotte area."}
{"text":"We frequent John's for the chicken parmesan. They also have amazing collard greens and beans. They have AMAZING coconut cream pie. Don't  miss it.

My only complaint about John's is that they won't let me order from the kids menu. I don't eat much so a full serving is always too much food for me."}
{"text":"We moved into the area recently and thanks to yelp we ended up at this place. We are so happy to have found this place. The food and the service is amazing! The staff is wonderful. We have been here for breakfast and lunch and the food was great and the portions are always huge."}
{"text":"This place is excellent when it comes to taste. The atmosphere is very home style diner. They also have some creative breakfast dishes on the menu such as their scrambled skillets which makes this joint unique compared to other breakfast diners. Wait time is a little slow but everything is really fresh tasting. We ordered the veggie skillet, coffee and fresh cold-pressed apple juice. The flavour was outstanding. The only reason I'm giving a 4 star review is because we asked for the veggie skillet and I found a piece of ham in the skillet so if you're a vegetarian, maybe let the server know so they can be a bit more mindful of this. I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Was looking for a one off place to eat.  Mom and Pop type shop and not your big box type of place.  I have passed by John's many time and told myself that one day I have to try this.  After speaking to many people I was getting the same vibe.  They have heard of it or seen it but haven't yet tried it.  I finally got around to stopping by.  I expected your typical diner style place but to my surprise the inside of John's was quite nice and trendy.  It was fairly busy but was seated right away.  The service started off well then got a little slow through out my visit.  My wife ordered breakfast which was HUGE.  Loaded with your typical breakfast food along with French toast on the side.  She gives her meal 5 stars.  I ordered the peameal club sandwich. Portion was huge, fries were amazing crispy and well cooked.  My sandwich was ok.  The size of the sandwich made it very hard to eat but the biggest let down was that the tomato made the sandwich very soggy.  There is nothing more that I hate than soggy bread.  None the less this can be fixed very easy.  Just minus the tomato.  I give 4 stars for the soggy bread and the slow service on the second half of my stay.  I will 100% be back to John's again but this time no tomatoes on the sandwich.  I will not hold back rom visiting just for something small like that.  If I could give 4.5 start I would as I don't feel 1 whole star needs to be taken away for my experience."}
{"text":"We visited during the first week this place was open. Highly dubious as restaurants in this location tend to fail... But wow. We've been searching for a good local breakfast place for ages (the pancake factory in Georgetown usually has long waits and Stacy lees is in desperate need of a Reno)... And here it is!

The portions were enormous, the food was delicious, the staff were incredibly friendly, and the decor is beautiful. You can get some diner classics without heading to your local dive now that these guys are in the neighborhood. Our two breakfasts were great value. 

I had the morning glory and honestly I got enough food for myself and my husband.

We will be back ...."}
{"text":"I hate to give any place one star, but the food was not good....at all. None of the people's food around me looked good. I was in a group so I heard a lot about the food. A few people who sat around me had frozen salads, still with ice on them. Obviously not a good start. People were complaining about when they would get their apps. 

Anyways, about my food. I order the chicken parm with baked zucchini and red potatoes. The potatoes were bland, the zucchini was not baked but instead marinated in bits of tomatoes and lots and lots of canola oil. Insanely oily. My chicken parm did not look like even a whole piece of chicken, more like a thin slab not even 1/8 of an inch thick, very thin. 

The rest of the audience in the restaurant were really old people which seems to be keeping this place alive and running.
If I happen to return I will order differently, otherwise this was a waste and a bad trip to the bathroom three hours later."}
{"text":"Great food wife had flounder stuffed with crab . With 2 side and I had stuffing turkey and dressing with collards and pinto and cornbread. Nice dinner."}
{"text":"Yep.  Huge portions. Really fresh.  Amazing back bacon.   Nice place seems like it will be super popular place for wasting time."}
{"text":"Great food and great service. The atmosphere is nice, new furniture, very clean. Good menu options. Would recommend for breakfast and lunch options. Prices are very fair. Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"I used to visit Johns when they were in Caledon and have also visited since they've moved to their new location. 

As always, the food is good and prices are reasonable.  Service is ok.  I will visit again."}
{"text":"Ok but definitely does not live up to the glowing reviews on here.  Very slow service at off peak time and the food was nothing special.  Not the best by far.  Won't be back.  Sunset grill is better and faster."}
{"text":"My parents have brought me here since I was a kid. I love the grilled salmon, collards, and fried squash."}
{"text":"Went to John's for the first time Great food, great staff. Will definitely be back. Gets quite busy on a Sunday."}
{"text":"This place is not good. The potatoes are cooked the night before and taste horrible. Stale and refrigerated. You need to prep in the morning people. Everything else is just bla plain and boring. Coffee is burnt. Not very good. The kitchen is not kept up. This place is a bunch of armatures trying to make a go of it. Give it up"}
{"text":"i ate there one time. i was not impressed.  and because i livr behind it i am ticked off that it is so noisy. they need to oil the crap on thier roof. noiay."}
{"text":"Came here twice during my stay in Brampton. Forgot what the pancake drenched in nutella and whip cream was called, but it was AMAZING. The salmon benedict was also a nice switch up from a regular breakfast. The meatlovers skillet was also delicious and they give you a generous amount of meat. Big portions, highly recommend this place for breakfast."}
{"text":"Relocated from the original location in Caledon on September 2015.

Nice clean place with lots of parking. We came for breakfast one Saturday morning and we waited about 10 minutes which was not bad as it was very busy.

Lots of options on the menu for breakfast and lunch and the staff are very nice. I have never seen so many Eggs Benedict options.

I had the Asparagus and Swiss Eggs Benedict which was great but we waited a while for our food. In the end it was worth the wait as the food was amazing."}
{"text":"Went in for a Saturday brunch with family/friends. Was a small restaurant and completely packed when we got there for noon. The OJ was freshly squeezed, which is always a plus! The breakfast plates were priced really well - between $6-12 each and the portion sizes were huge too. Food was regular breakfast items such as eggs of all kinds, pancakes, waffles etc. Also had a slim selection of lunch entrees. Service was really good and we would definitely go back. The only downside is I wish their menu had more variety for breakfast items.. and they offered avocados!"}
{"text":"Being new to the area I will try any place, at least once.
Today, my coworkers took me out to lunch once again. I've learned to take everything they say with a grain of salt.... \"Let's go to John's today...they got excellent food\". Well, to each his own. 

Upon arrival, we were seated quickly. Our waitress took our beverage order and came back with them immediately. She was as good as they come.

\"Great food at reasonable Prices\" is what they claim....personally, I think its reasonable/ok food at great prices. It's not awful but it's not great. I ordered the chicken cutlets with, mashed potatoes and collards. You can tell the cutlets had been frozen for a while, Mash potatoes were out of the box and way to runny, and the collards were actually pretty good.  My colleagues ordered the fried cod fish, collards, rice, cole slaw & squash. Everything looked OK, just ok.

You get what you pay for. Our meals were around $7 each and that's exactly what we got: $7 meals. I wont willingly come back to this place, but if you're in the area I would say try it out over a fast food chain."}
{"text":"First asked foremost, for there customer services, if I could give a 6 outta 5 I would. The team works like a team. Was a refreshing change.

There ambiance is another great feature. Clean modern dark. Was quite busy for a Thurs at 11am. But after I tried the food, I wasn't surprised at all. 

I had the Hercules Breakfast with sausages, eggs, real thick cut bacon, peameal bacon, hash, fruit and toast. Everything was done perfectly. For the first time the toast was actually toasty. With a minimal out of butter. The smoked salmon eggs Benedict was delicious. I'd been craving smoked salmon for a couple days. This was a nice way to curb that. Also I gotta mention. The coffee. Dark and toasty. So so nice. Def a place to visit!"}
{"text":"After living in Brampton for some time now, I think I have scouted out most of the breakfast places in the area.  After using my trusty Yelp app I happened upon John's Family Restaurant.  

I remember a place called John's Family Restaurant up in the Caledon area.  This happens to be the same place.  Located in a strip mall in its own stand alone building, from what I remember used to be a fast food restaurant.  The decor is upscale and casual, tables and booths with banquets fill the restaurant along with a small bar with seating as well.  We sat ourselves and were quickly attended to.  The service from first impressions is quite good, our server was friendly and approachable.  The menu here varies from breakfast/lunch to dinner and it is quite different between both.  On the breakfast menu there is the usual fare of breakfast items (french toast, eggs, bacon etc) and even some light lunch items.  I did get to take a look at the dinner menu which varied from NY strip-loin to varied pastas and some excellent Greek/Mediterranean items.

Going off book and ordering something different for breakfast is not my wife's thing.  Its always a BLT with fries, but the description for the meatball sandwich was too good to resist for my wife.  Homemade meatballs and sauce with melted pizza mozzarella on a toasted bun sounded awesome.  I ordered something called the \"The French Connection\" a very unassuming item...bacon eggs sausage and french toast.  

The service here is quite good, just like at the beginning.  Every time I needed something our server was in easy reach. Our food arrived in a timely manner, considering how busy the restaurant got while we were there.  My wife's food came first and it looked amazing, our friend ordered a Greek burger which also looked delicious.  My order came out next....Yikes!! Two full plates of food!! It looked like a full order of French toast and my order of eggs, bacon, homefries and sausage with a bowl of fruit to top it all off!!  The food was excellent and the portion sizes are quite good.  If your in the north part of Brampton and your looking for a great spot for breakfast, lunch or dinner..check out John's Family Restaurant...you won't be disappointed...5 stars"}
{"text":"I've driven by this place many times but never thought of visiting it. I always thought it was just some small run down mom and pop cafe (since the location was formally owned by Country Style and because the exterior is very cheap looking). After seeing all the great reviews of this place, I decided to visit for breakfast and was shocked at how beautiful it was on the inside and how many customers were inside lol.  The staff were super friendly, and the food was delicious.  I like how the food was not overly greasy like other breakfast places.  I'll definitely visit again.  But if I had one comment to the owners - it's please update the exterior of the restaurant to match the inside! You guys deserve a much better logo and signage, and it'll definitely attract more customers and look less empty. :)"}
{"text":"Came for breakfast! I had French Toast and side sausage, and my boyfriend had the morning glory breakfast.
Food, pricing and restaurant appearance was fantastic. 
Staff are friendly, but could do more smiling. 
Will come back for sure!"}
{"text":"So, upon seeing where this place is located, Lee and I got in an argument for most of the length of our wait (It was very busy on a Sunday!) as to what the original building this place is located was.

... it was a Wendy's. But other than a few little hints of paint on the doors and the ghost of a drive-through, you can't really tell. It's been redone to be very nice, with a clean and simple look.

Once we were seated, it was time to look over the menu. Lee, ever being the sucker for French Toast, decided to go with The French Connection, which ended up being a truckload of food. Too much food, Lee complained a little. For only $12 he got 3 eggs, a pile of bacon, a few sausages, a pile of potatoes, AND French toast. I think he would have been happy paying the same price for half the food, but he did still finish it.

I made sort of a similar mistake. Their benny comes in a small and a large, and I really should have gotten the small. The large was three bennys, with great peameal, nicely cooked eggs, and delicious hollandaise, with fruit as well.

Service was friendly, coffee was delicious, and overall it was a great place. I would definitely return!"}
{"text":"This is another occasional lunch spot my coworkers and I visit.  

For lunch they serve various homestyle meals.  Think meat and 2 veggies.  And banana pudding counts as a veggie!   The lunch menu changes daily as well as some of the side items but you always get your choice of biscuit or cornbread.

If you're looking for a gourmet lunch, this is not your place.  But if you want some simple home cooking where almost everything is made fresh daily, this is a good place.

Things to stay away from are the Cheese Steak when they have it.  It was like roast beef smothered in cheese and a gravy.  Not something someone from PA would consider a cheesesteak.  Also the tuna came out overcooked the last time I had it.  In some cases, they use a lot of salt which affects the entire meal.

Things you can't go wrong with here include the turkey and stuffing, chicken tips, meatloaf, baked fish.  The collard greens are usually good and I love the banana pudding as a veggie!!!

Oh and I hear most of the desserts are homemade!"}
{"text":"This is a clean little location in North Brampton. Foods decent & so was the service. It's just basic diner food that doesn't stick out that much. I'd go again."}
{"text":"I've eaten here many times over the years.  It's the usual Greek family owned restaurant much like the countless others in Charlotte... except they have an abundance of overgrown plants, worn carpet, old upholstery, really old kids' pictures and drawings and dusty trophies used as decor.  You can tell that they (along with every other American) are struggling during these hard times.  You can see it in the lady's eyes at the register.  You can tell that they've had some health issues and that things aren't rolling as smoothly as perhaps they once did.  

The daily special menu is an over copied, jumbled mix of typed and hand written items; some with corresponding numbers and some without.  Their food used to be a lot like the old Gus' Sir Beef on Monroe Road, some of the menu numbers were even the same, but now it's just so so.  Nothing is great anymore like it used to be, not even the fried squash  :-(  I stay away from the plastic menu and always order from the daily specials.  Some items are usually acceptable, but I find that even those items are dwindling as time passes.  

Times are indeed difficult for everyone and my money is tight, I just can't justify spending my money here much anymore."}
{"text":"Enjoyable place to eat with great entrees. Tucked away from the main street, John's has a large parking lot and gets a whole variety of customers. The restaurant seems to be run quite well, the washrooms are clean and the service was attentive and friendly.

I enjoyed the mashed potatoes which were made from scratch. The presentation reminded me of the \"mashed potato gravy volcano\"' that I used to dream about as a kid. The souvlaki was also tasty, though I wish there was more souvlaki!

Wifi password is johns2016."}
{"text":"I discovered this place a few months ago and I love it. The feeling of a family diner runs deep. At first when I came I felt out of place because there were alot if seniors and I am in my 20s but food there is good and cheap too! Also the staff is very nice and more than willing to answer questions. A tip though is to order more of the southern cooking than things such as pasta though the family who owns it is Greek the pasta related food such as baked ziti was not as good, thats why I am giving 4 stars but other food & staff is really good."}
{"text":"Was looking for a Gyro place and John's came up. I went in to order take out which was not easy, no one wanted to take my order and kept pointing to some lady on the phone. From going inside I realized this is more of a breakfast place, I did not see anyone eating any other meal except for eggs. The Gyro did not have as much meat as expected and not enough Taziki sauce. Probably won't be coming back here it's nothing I would crave."}
{"text":"Very happy to have found Johns restaurant, food is made fresh so there is a bit of waiting time but in my opinion totally worth it, one of my faves is their souvlaki platter and their seafood chowder!  Burgers and fries not to be missed either.
The service is friendly and attentive.  Always enjoy dining at John's Resto!"}
{"text":"This place sure gets busy!!!  I was here in a Monday and by 9pm its was pretty much full.
Came here as a friend suggested for breakfast.  Raved about the portions.
The price is a bit on the higher side... with that comes larger eggs, 4 pieces of sausages (what i got... so I am assuming other sides would be extra than normal) instead of normally 3.
I also like the side of fruits that comes with it.
Coffee was ok... no flavor kinds though... I do love my Vanilla Hazelnut.
Service was friendly and I like the booth seating.

I came here for breakfast... but will try 1 day during lunch/ dinner.
I hear their burgers are amazing!"}
{"text":"tasty food for sure. it's a fairly new restaurant. I like that it offers brunch as well not only breakfast. the restaurant has lots of seating tables and a sitting bar. a few reasons why I gave this restaurant a 4 star; the temperature inside is awfully warm. no music playing only a TV set on news.. (was quite distracting when the news is playing a siren) service was pleasant but slow. accent wall with random pictures and two chalk boards.. I didn't understand what that was about. 

I'll be honest though I will come back! definitely a family restaurant. menu has a wide variety of items and pricing is reasonable. 
lots of parking available as well. 
method of payment accepted, plastic and good old cash."}
{"text":"I'm one of those people for second chances, because sometimes restaurants have off days. This was that day. It was a friendly atmosphere, the waitress was nice. I came with a friend, I had the feta and spinach eggs Benedict, she had the California Benedict. I tried both, and preferred the Feta and Spinach, the ham was perhaps to big for the Benedict. I want to try a few other things on the menu, so I'll be going back."}
{"text":"I was expecting something more \"diner\" with burgers and fried eggs. But that's not what John's is. John's is an entree restaurant. Steak tips and chicken parmesan and broiled flounder and liver & onions. I opted for one of the specials, a plate of baked ziti. It arrived freshly prepared after I'd enjoyed a house salad. A decent portion and very hot from the oven. The pasta inside was a bit overdone and mushy, but the sauce was great and there was a ton of cheese over the top.

Clearly, there's a crowd of seniors that love this place. It's definitely comfort food with a Southern accent. And that's okay!"}
{"text":"I had the greek salad with chicken  (standard extra cost ) and let me tell you, they sure pour on the chicken. The salad tasted great and with all that chicken meat it fills you up. I've eaten at other places where you get 25% or less of chicken and the dish cost more!"}
{"text":"After reading the amazing Yelp reviews, we decided to come for brunch today. We are regular breakfast goers and were really looking forward to this place. Upon arriving it wasn't too busy and we got seated at a booth. The waitress was nice and took our orders promptly. 

After that it was downhill. We were waiting close to 20 mins when the waitress came out and said there was an error and the chef did not get our orders so they were just starting to make it. No problem, so we waited. The food came about 10 mins later. Then we realized that they had given the wrong omelette so we had to send it back and wait again. The food was okay, but not substantially better than other places and the home fries were pretty hard/burnt. 

Overall the waitress and atmosphere were nice, but I don't think we will be returning."}
{"text":"We were really looking forward to John's re-opening closer to our house and with a larger location. 
The renovations are great the place looks super. 
Unfortunately the service has been very slow the times we've visited. A two hour wait for eggs really puts a dent in your day. 
Hoping they sort out the staffing shortage. 
Will wait a few months before trying again."}
