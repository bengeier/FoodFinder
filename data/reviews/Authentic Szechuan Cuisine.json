{"text":"I love spicy Szechuan food, however the favors here are off. We had spicy stir fried chicken but it was so oily. It should be drier but instead it's soaked in oil, which mess up the texture. For the fish pan, the flavors are off too. It just doesn't taste good enough, lacking flavors. All you can taste is the hot spices but no other flavors. 

The service was okay, it did take us two tries to get our bowl of rice and our drinks. It is kind of pricy too. It's almost $30 dollars per person when we only ordered one dish of veggie, one dish of chicken, and a fish pan. The fish pan basically taste like the malatang in pmall but way expensive. 

I'm giving a low rating only because of how food tasted, which was pretty bad."}
{"text":"We ordred the Tilapia fish with spicy sauce. 2.7 lbs of fish hardly yielded any fish meat at all. The meat of the fish on both sides were sliced off then covered with tons of garnish to cover up the missing meat. We only had a piece of small fish and were looking for the rest of the meat. I summoned the server to ask how come the fish had very little meat. She explained that it shrunk while cooking and that there is meat on the other side of the fish. She vanished before I could check the other side of the fish. This resto is a must avoid ! The head of the fish was quite large so it had to containlots of meat but none was found. There were very small broken pieces near the head. Restaurants like this should not be allowed to operate and fool people ! No wonder the server insisted we try the fish when we first declined. She already had a plan. Second dish we ordered was the string beans with minced pork. There was no minced pork at all. It seemed that the beans were just slid over the minced meat and presented for consumption. Third item was Kung Po chicken with peanuts. Wrong again ! It should have called \"peanuts with chicken\" because there were more peanuts than chicken. ! Sly move on the part of the restaurant they sliced the chicken into so small pieces as small as the peanuts so as to make it look like there were lots of chicken. We had to look for the chicken ! \""}

What do rabbits, turtles, and frogs all have in common? Is it:
They are all considered good household pets for children
They comprise the menu for Jen K's fear factor UYE or
All of the above
If you guessed all of the above than you are correct! 

I came here this past Saturday as part of a fear factor UYE, this place serves some spooky but quite delicious Chinese delicacies. Our menu for the night consisted of 5 dishes, some of which were more adventurous than others. The first dish to come out was a large soup consisting of a whole chicken and a whole turtle (shell and everything!). This was a very home-style kind of dish, the broth was quite excellent (not salty at all), the chicken was quite tender and the turtle to my surprise was pretty delicious, it had a very mild flavour. I loved that that had every part of the animals in the soup (even the head), this would be a great dish to enjoy and a cold winters day. 

The next dish to come out was stir fried rabbit head. This was my least favourite dish of the night, the rabbit head had so little meat on it and was very difficult to eat, however this dish did have a nice kick to it thanks to all the Szechuan peppercorns it was cooked with. The last adventurous dish was frogs legs which were served in an oil and chilli pepper broth. These bad boys were hopingly good, very skinny and boney frog's legs had such beautifully tender meat that has quite a mild flavour. Again this was a spicy dish cooked with red chillies and some of those numbing Szechuan peppercorns. 

Our other 2 dishes were not that adventurous but still tasty. One dish was chilli chicken which consisted of small crispy fried pieces of chicken cooked with about a pound of red chillies and peppercorns. The chicken was cooked really well, so crispy on the outside but still tender and moist, this dish packed quite the spicy punch. Lastly we had a dish of boiled Chinese cucumber which gave us a nice palate cleanse from all the red chilli and numbing peppercorns we were ingesting, definitely much needed relief. 

Most of the dishes we had on this night had to be ordered in advance to ensure the restaurant has these weird meats in stock. On a Saturday night this restaurant was quite busy and full of younger people. I was basically the only non-Asian person in the restaurant which is always a sure sign that you are in for an authentic meal (no chicken balls here!). The servers did not speak English very well so be sure to bring a friend who can speak the language. My only beef with this place was that they had no Chinese beer! How is that even possible? Anyways the food made up for the lack of Chinese beer and I would love to return to this place for a more normal meal."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend to try some of they specials.. The food is really good and tasty.. Menu is also very organized and with amazing pictures that can guide you..

Overall, The food Is good and fresh but is not a place that i'll come back right on the next day, the service is great too btw, even though we got a new waitress serving us but she did a pretty good job recommending and helping us decide..

If you like chinese food, this is a place you should stop by to try something different.."}
{"text":"?????????????????????????????????????? ??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????? :)"}
{"text":"This place is waiting to close down.

Wanted to try this place because a friend recommended saying the food was really really good.

Came here earlier this week around 8pm and they were closing soon, so we ended going next door to the BBQ full (which was really good and full of customers).

Came back today at 7pm, the place was completely empty, not a single customer.

Checked Yelp and saw some horrible reviews, looked at the pictures, there was nothing we wanted to eat.  

So the 5 of us ordered 2 main stream dishes to try.

The \"water cooked fish\" (fish fillet cooked in chilli oil) was horrible!!! The worst we have bee had.  The 5 of us didn't even finish the dish, with more then half of it left.

The Bacon dish we ordered was ok. We killed the protein But left all the veggies.

Got the bill and then left right away.  We have hem face by not walking directly over to the next door restaurant and drove down the street to a different restaurant instead."}
{"text":"What a horrible place. I don't normally give out a lot of one stars, but this place definitely deserves one.

We walked in a little after six and ordered four dishes, which took over an hour to come. They served the first dish after 30 minutes, then another dish after another 5 minutes, then we waited for another 20 minutes before the next two dishes came. Needless to say, we polished off the first dish, ate of of the second dish hoping to wait for the next two, and the dishes all fell cold.

The WORST part is that it costed us $60. Expensive. Slow and horrible service. 
0 customer satisfactory.

Don't go.

horrible horrible horrible."}
{"text":"Rabbit, Frog, Chicken, Turtle.. You read about them all in fairy tales and children's storybooks.

But this evening at our Scary Fear Factor UYE, they are all on our dinner table.

#209 Szechuan Rabbit Head $15.99
- Compare to the photos I saw on google, this is not at all scary
- Hardly has enough meat or interesting thing to munch on
- The veggies on the side though spicy and interesting: Rabbit in the forest...
- Where is my Beer?

#207 Spicy Frog $15.99
- Frog swimming in a red spicy broth..
- The meat is quite tender and lean... taste like chicken? 
- Where is the head?

#208 Special Deep Fried Diced Chicken with Dried Chili $13.99 
- little pieces of diced chicken hidden in a mountain of chili pepper... 
- just like a treasure hunt that we have to look for those chicken pieces.. 
- peppercorns tingly and numbing spicy
- Where is my Beer!

River Turtle and Tender Hen with Soup ($58.99)  
- What a presentation!
- Accordingly to folklore (Ba Wang Bie Ji - Farewell My Concubine), this is a special dish connected with a moving story in Chinese history. This moving story is widely known among the Chinese and this dish is created by Xuzhou people to commemorate them. The dish is made by steaming turtle and chicken in a pottery pot with fresh soup, wine, shallots, hams, mushrooms and other ingredients. It is famous for the crisp meat, mellow and fresh soup as well as its novel appearance *
- A soup with a story, a presentation and suppose to be good for your health too!

Thanks for everyone that comes out  for the UYE with an open mind and great attitude! The food might be scary for some, but they are traditional Szechuan area dishes that serves in China. 

Authentic Szechuan Cuisine is definitely authentic, a taste of Szechuan in Scarborough!

But really they don't have any Chinese Imported beers at all? All sold out? How's disappointing!
