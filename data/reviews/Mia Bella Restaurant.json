{"text":"Hands down the best Italian food in the city ! There is nothing fancy about the place, very approachable for anyone and the value for the price point is great ! Wine list and wine knowledge for the serves needs work but the ambiance and service aptitude makes up for it by leaps and bounds ! highly recommend this place any day of the year !"}
{"text":"Lovely restaurant in Little Italy, friendly staff, great food, 5/5 would recommend to a friend."}
{"text":"We went during a March blizzard and the place was still packed with great people and fun energy! We sat at the bar and our bartender was phenomenal -- so friendly and passionate about the restaurant, and very knowledgable about the menu which was wonderful since my boyfriend and I are vegan. We decided on vino and split the gnocchi. I'm not usually one to crave Italian dishes but the gnocchi I will crave from here on out! We'll definitely be back soon -- for each the ambiance, service, and food!"}
{"text":"One of our favorite places in Little Italy, if not Cleveland. My husband and I lived in the Little Italy neighborhood when this place opened its doors, and it quickly became one of our favorite places to frequent. We explored most, if not all, of the menu and loved everything we tried, from the Pasta Verde and Veal Braciole to the Spicy Couscous and Kebobs. The Albanian Salad is so simple, but simply delicious! It's reasonably priced; the people are incredibly friendly, and the food is consistently excellent. A must try."}
{"text":"A sweet restaurant located in the little Italia. A little bit pricey but the food is really good. Our waiter was nice, too. One problem is parking. I followed Yelp to this restaurant and it was so hard to find a parking spot in that area, it almost drove me crazy and I was thinking about eating somewhere else. Good thing the food worth it."}
{"text":"Love this place. We come here at least once a month. The food is authentic Italian food.  We have tried just about everything on the menu and have never been disappointed. The wait staff is so friendly and attentive. As soon as you walk in they act as if your the only person in the establishment. If you want real Italian food with a relaxing experience this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"I agree with Neil V.  Two stars.  We also had the same poor service.  After he took our order, we NEVER saw our waiter again.  I had to track down a lady w/blonde curly hair who was wiping down tables & filling water pitchers to get refills for our beverages.  Never checked to see how our food was.  Had to track down someone else to get cheese for our pasta dish which was also delivered by someone other than our waiter.  He did magically appear though at check time.  

Also agree with Stanley W.  Had a long wait for a bowl of pasta.  So, for food that you can get better quality just across the street, poor service and long wait...I would go elsewhere in little Italy."}
{"text":"Walked over from the Courtyard Marriott while on a business trip in Cleveland. Mia Bella is a wonderful little place in the heart of Little Italy. I had the Frutti de Mare Piccante, which was excellent. Not to be missed when staying near or visiting the University Circle area."}
{"text":"I went to Bella Mia after reading the high reviews on here.  I was not impressed.  I know how good italian food should taste and this wasn't it.  Not a bad place, but in little italy I would expect a lot better.  The menu looks the part with good options, but the actual dishes dont do the menu justice.  I would not go back here."}
{"text":"I never make a public review of a restaurant but the owner of Mia Bella behaved so disrespectfully that I feel compelled to share my experience. When his mother in law was hosting the front of the house she made the patrons feel very welcome. I loved the eggplant appetizer and commented that I wished that they had it on the menu as a meal. Done. From that point on, Lisa made sure that I had a delicious and nice portion of eggplant parmigiana with a small side of pasta. So Friday we went to celebrate my birthday with my favorite dish. I ordered as I had often done in the past. This time I got a large portion of pasta with a very small side of eggplant. I spoke to the waiter about my expectation and disappointment. He was so nice and went to speak with the chef/owner. The response from the kitchen was basically \"too bad, that's the way we do it\". I said I really didn't want pasta I mainly wanted eggplant & Lisa had done it differently in the past. The waiter felt bad and offered to go back to the kitchen to see if he could get me another piece of eggplant. He said he was sorry but the chef would not do that. The best he could do is pack up all that unwanted pasta for me. I nicely said That I couldn't believe that the chef wouldn't make it right nor would he come speak to me. The waiter felt so bad that he offered to buy me another eggplant app out of his own pocket. Of course I did not let him do that but the offer was so sweet. I couldn't believe that the owner did not care about his customers and let the girls at the front desk know that as I was leaving. My husband (while we were still in the restaurant told the waiter he was giving a once beloved restaurant a bad review) yelped it. The owners response was so appalling. Part stated \"I'm sorry that Lisa was not there to kiss your ass and give you free eggplant...\" (read the review by Howard Z for the full response). This is not a way to gain customers. Not only will we never return but I felt compelled to warn others that this restaurant is no longer a warm welcoming place to come."}
{"text":"Out first time in Little Italy. Visiting Cleveland. We just stopped in looking for Dinner somewhere. Wow. What a find. Outstanding. Can't wait to go back next week when I am back in town."}
{"text":"Had to return a week after my first visit, that's how impressed I was with my fish (that I proceeded to order again!) 

Grilled Scallops with butternut squash, tomatoes, mushroom and spinach - the vegetables never tasted this good! I'm serious, you gotta try this if you are like me and don't have the best relationship with vegetables - it's going to blow your mind:) 

If you can, try to seat outside - making a reservation would help. I found the inside to be a little...blah, especially on a nice sunny day! That, however, did not affect the quality  of the food:)"}
{"text":"Amazing Calamari Appetizer! Enough for an entire meal. Thank you Ryan for the incredible recommendation and perfect service! Mia Bella is lucky to have you on their team Ryan!!"}
{"text":"Showed up at 7:00 for a 7:00 reservation and were seated promptly. Service was good, but not overly attentive, and the restaurant was very loud. I went with my wife and ordered the calamari appetizer. The sauce was good, with a wine lemon tomato based sauce. Sounds weird but it was unusual and tasty. Unfortunately, The calamari was over cooked and chewy.  
I ordered the ziti with prosciutto, calamari olives and other veggies and wanted to substitute fettuccine, but was told there would be a 3-4 dollar up charge. I asked why and the server told me it was a specialty pasta. I asked about linguini and he said no up charge for that. Does this make any sense to you? Anyhow, the sauce was tasty, kind of like putanesca but a bit different. However, there was no prosciutto, only ham cut up. Big difference to me... Pasta was not al dente, a bit over cooked. The meal was served very hot however. My wife got the bolognese and said it was pretty good. Her pasta was also what she felt was over cooked. 
Overall, I would say 3 out of 5.  Being in Murray hill, there are several other restaurants I feel have better food. 
I would not repeat."}
{"text":"I had an excellent experience here. Arrived for dinner with two colleagues, and we shared the eggplant appetizer. Eggplant was not unique, but the ricotta on top was out of this world. I had the gnocchi and added sausage - amazing. I wish I could have taken the leftovers with me, but I was still in a hotel. A colleague had the lamb chops and loved them, and the other had the scallops and said they were also excellent. Service was very good and we got right in on a Wednesday night at 6:30."}
{"text":"This was our first time to Little Italy and we used Yelp to find Mia Bella.  The reviews were good and they were correct!  This place is awesome!  Our waiter, Drew, was prompt, friendly, helpful and offered good drink and menu selections. We sat outside on a balmy November evening in northeast Ohio and enjoyed everything that was going on in Little Italy.  Drew also recommended a bakery a few doors up and again, he was right, the cannoli was amazing. We will be back for more Mia Bella!!!!"}
{"text":"I am newer to Cleveland and live downtown. I was told to check out \"little  Italy\" on my explorations sometime. When arriving to little Italy, I noticed this restaurant right away. The atmosphere is inviting and the room was filled with delicious smells. I got a table by the windows, which was nice because it was one of the freakishly warm days In March and there were plenty of people walking around. My waiter was pleasant and quick. I ordered spaghetti with sausage, which was amazing and the serving size was bordering on too much. The presentation of my food was beyond my expectations for the moderately priced dish I ordered. After cleaning my plate and paying my bill I ran into the Maitre d', she was very nice, and easy to talk to. She seemed genuinely interested in me and how my experience was at her restaurant. We got to talking about my situation and she was and was a wealth of knowledge on things I should do and explore being new to the area. I will eat here again, and hope to run into her again!"}
{"text":"Went there on a Friday with a group of 6.  We arrived late for our reservations but they let us in right away.  Food was great!  I highly recommend the eggplant parmigiana appetizer and my entree of penne with prosciutto was good too.  Service wasn't amazing, but not bad enough to go to 4 stars."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere! Food was amazing. Must try the soup, it's made to order. James was a great waiter"}
{"text":"Went for late lunch around 3:30. Great food and atmosphere! Bread is served (which tastes amazing) so no need for appetizer. Reasonable price; 1 appetizer, 2 main course= around $40."}
{"text":"Best gluten free pizza in Cleveland, look no further.  Well worth the drive/wait if you don't have the reservation.  My fave is the Chef's Special."}
{"text":"The food here is world class! We had the cheese tortellini the linguini carbonara, it had to have been two of the best pasta dishes outside of Rome. The service was absolutely top notch. It was a busy Saturday in little Italy, and being 65 in December meant the crowds were larger than normal. Gary (the manager) was kind and thoughtful, he treated us to a great meal. With much owed to him, the service was excellent. Would come back 10/10 times. This is the place that keeps little Italy alive!"}

{"text":"My spectacular boyfriend made reservations for a late dinner.  Upon arrival, our table wasn't ready so we were directed to the bar.  The bartender was awesome - let us sample 3 different wines before we decided on a bottle.  When our table was ready, we were seated and the waiter brought us some delish warm bread.  The bf really enjoyed the bread... it was good, definitely tasted fresh, would have been better with olive oil, but whatev, its bread.  I ordered the pasta verde and it was amazing.  The only thing that sucked was the fact that I was staying in a hotel and didn't have a fridge for my leftovers.  Marcus had the Mia Bella pasta with chicken.  The chicken tasted really fresh and was cooked perfectly, grilled not breaded.  We were seated near the entrance to the kitchen so we kept seeing desserts pass us all evening so there was no passing on dessert... everything sounded amazing but we went with a 9 layer chocolate concoction.  So good!  Service was awesome and the food was to die for #pastacoma"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place in little Italy. The food is great, they have outdoor seating, the wait staff is very nice and always considerate, and importantly the food is fresh and delicious with some modern twists on Italian classics."}
{"text":"Really nice atmosphere, great service and not at least good food. I'll recommend the saganaki shrimps!"}
{"text":"Loved our evening and the food was not disappointing! My only complaint was the sauces all tasted very similar. We ordered 2 pasta dishes and the seafood of the day and hmmmm all the same sauce! Lots happening outside so don't go inside, much better atmosphere out!"}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised. Calamari, sautéed and tossed with super-fresh grape tomatoes, zucchini and creamy tomato sauce, makes a perfect summer appetizer.  Madison, stellar server that she was, recommended the tortellini special (smoky cheese-filled in a prosciutto, peas and grape-tomato sauce with a little kick) to much satisfaction. We also tried the Chef's Special pizza: chorizo, peppers and onions over pesto. Thumbs up. Very good portions: we'll be eating some concoction of these leftovers for at least two days. And while we didn't get dessert (Corbo's is a couple doors down), they had a good-looking selection. Price was agreeable too: two non-alcoholic drinks, big appetizer, specialty entry and pizza, with tip, was $60."}
{"text":"This just might be my favorite restaurant in Little Italy. I have never had a bad meal here, the staff is incredibly friendly, and their portions are well worth the price. Definitely check this place out!"}
{"text":"Love Mia Bella!

If you're looking for a change from standard red-sauce Italian in Little Italy, Mia Bella is your place. Delicious variety and good prices. Take it from this full-blooded Italian: try Mia Bella!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing food and even better service. Our waitress, Allison, was hands down the best waitress we've ever had. She was so polite and helpful. She checked on us often and made sure we were completely taken care of. We couldn't have been happier! She gave us the perfect service!  Everything we ordered was made fresh and very delicious. We had the mussels, veal, polenta, bread, and more. All of it was wonderful! We can't wait to go back. My husband and I HIGHLY recommend this restaurant. The owners are so sweet and helpful, as well. Go dine here! You will be so glad you did!"}
{"text":"We had really good time in Mia Bella. Waitress was really professional and took care about everything. Wine was nice and food was delicious. We gave 4 stars because one dish was little late but the rest was perfect. Thank you for a nice night."}
{"text":"I have been here several times. I like the Zuppa de casa, but sometimes it didn't present standard level. Most of deserts are outstanding but I wouldn't recommend tiramisu. Since I have been visited Italy more than ten times I know how is authentic italiano dishes. I think this restaurant presents slightly higher standard comparing with other italiana restaurant. Seafood was recommended."}
{"text":"A beautiful summer night to have dinner at Mia Bella. The first thing I noticed is HOW COMFORTABLE THE CHAIRS ARE FOR OUTDOOR SEATING! Seriously. 

The second thing was the food. I had the shrimp Saganaki and the cheese tortellini. Both are bomb de la bomb. There is a reason why they got awarded because it was delicious. 

The service was good for outdoor seating, no long waits for water to be refilled, and food came out quickly despite the large amount of people for a Wednesday night. Wine was good for the price as well. This is a must try spot in Little Italy and I was very satisfied.

Oh yeah, they play music outside too! I smiled joy when I heard the Godfather theme song and \"Time to say goodbye\" by the one and only Andrea Bocelli."}
{"text":"Thank you Yelp community! I was in Cleveland on business and looking for a dinner restaurant. Mia Bella was reasonably close to my hotel and highly ranked by Yelpers. The hotel had a shuttle that would take us there and both the front desk and shuttle driver said this place was great. My friend and I both started with the Zuppa di Casa - which was fantastic. I ordered the farfalle bolognese and my friend had the eggplant parm. Both were great. For dessert I had a caramel soufflé topped with vanilla gelato and my friend had spumoni (because it reminded her of her childhood). Big thumbs up for the caramel vanilla treat. 

I also need to mention the great service we received. Our waitress knew the entire menu and was well prepared to answer our numerous questions. All of the other staff were attentive as well, but our waitress was like having an Italian mother to help us. After dinner while we were waiting for the shuttle, we had a nice conversation with Sonny (I'm pretty sure that's his name) about the restaurant and the neighborhood. I love supporting family owned businesses, especially ones like Mia Bella. Next time I'm in Cleveland I will go out of my way to come back here."}
{"text":"on a recommendation from hotel, meade the trek over.   not usually an italian good fan, but very glad i made the journey.   cheese tortilenni and added spicy italian sausage... had to order more bread to clean the bowel like the windows in the vatican... momma mia!"}
{"text":"Went for dinner on Wednesday night and it was great. The food and service was spectacular. Great selection of Italian wines. we had the Chianti which was affordable and delicious. We ordered the veal and tortellini and everything was perfect. Had to take some home because portions are pretty big. We will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"Love this place, aside from the pasta, it has the most amazing appetizer ever eggplant Parmesan with marinara sauce and homemade ricotta cheese  Heaven"}
{"text":"This place is a gem. We decided to try this restaurant because of the reviews on yelp. It was delicious! The waitress was fantastic and very receptive to our needs. She made the experience very relaxing by not rushing our order. We ordered four or five different appetizers and shared them. Everything was fantastic and this is one place you should try!"}
{"text":"My dish tasted like margarine and day old, microwaved pasta. There isn't any justification for that. The tomato cream sauce tasted cheap, like velveeta.
Sample tasting of the house sauce is not allowed.
I cannot understand how this place received such high ratings. I would give zero stars but that is also not allowed."}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants in Cleveland! Been here multiple times and have never been disappointed. Food and service are always on point. Lobster ravioli is a must have!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, excellent service, 5 star experience-

Started off the meal with a Golden Arugula Salad which was fantastic.  Fresh cut apples wrapped in prosciutto with the perfect amount of goat cheese and arugula.

Sipped on a tasty old fashioned while I waited for my main course to arrive.  While waiting, the complimentary bread was warm, fresh, and delicious.

The lobster stuffed ravioli came out hot and timely.  A healthy amount of lobster meat was stuffed into well prepared noodles with a creamy sauce (vodka?), topped with fresh Parmesan cheese.

All in all, for a Monday night, the atmosphere was lively and friendly.  Superb experience all around."}
{"text":"Had the best pasta ever!!! Pasta Verde with Chicken...although it wasn't green because this pesto also has marinara, garlic and lemon juice.

Sorry no pic...I was too hungry as the wait was quite long for a family of four. Definitely will make reservations next time."}
{"text":"Replying to Mohammed A comment

Are you sure you are a New York native? LOL! And your spelling is \"defiantly\" impeccable! And yes that restaurant was great."}
{"text":"The Chicken Parm and Calamari are very good. Our kids got the Pizza and Cesar Salads. Everything was great, especially the service.  The place is well kept and welcoming.  Perfect for a family.  I would easily recommend Mia Bella. Plan on dessert."}
{"text":"YUM!  
This was the highlight of a 10 day stay at the Clinic - while my husband had surgery.

My Grandparents took me out for a treat. Very small and quaint.  Sat at the bar and waited for an outside table.  Wine list was fantastic and our bartender was nice enough to let me try a couple samples.  Enjoyed Prosecco for as starter.  With dinner I enjoyed the Zenato Ripassa- a hard to find, YUMMY Italian Red :)
The best dish was a special - Gram had Lobster Ravioli.  This should be on the menu it was that good.  Perfect smaller portion as it was very rich and creamy.

I can't wait to go back and take my husband.  I wish I could remember our server's name.  She was very sweet and helpful."}
{"text":"Not only was the food fantastic but so was the service. Our server was the best I have ever experienced at any restaurant. He was courteous of our timing as we had tickets to the symphony that evening. He was attentive but not over-bearing.   Highly recommend this place and can't wait to come back!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were visiting Cleveland for the weekend and heard about Mia Bella through word of month. And yes, it lived up to our expectation!  I got the scampi pappardelle and my boyfriend got the lobster ravioli. Both were phenomenal. The scampi was light, but filling. The lobster ravioli was rich and decadent. Exactly what you would want from both dishes!  And THE BREAD. Soft, crusty, warm and delicious. True comfort meal. Aside from the meal, the wait staff was equally as phenomenal. Our waitress truly cared to please us. You could tell she really cared about the quality of the food. She even went as far as telling us the best places for dessert in Cleveland, rather than pushing us to get desserts there.  I have confidence that their desserts were just as good as the main show, however, we needed an intermission after the feast we just ate.  Thank you, Mia Bella! Next time we are in Cleveland, we will be sure to pay another visit. Worth the trip!"}
{"text":"Wonderful restaurant. The quality of the food is amazing. I got to try four of their pasta dishes and each one was equally amazing! The only reason why I am giving it a four out of five was because I thought that it was a little over priced for what you got; however, do not let that deter you from visiting this wonderful restaurant in Little Italy!"}
{"text":"LOVE this place.  It's a little pricey but the food is the best in Little Italy! The staff are attentive and friendly.  Doesn't get much better!"}
{"text":"I'm updating my review to give this place 5 stars. We came on a very busy evening, our waiter was very new and there were a few things about our meal and experience that were less than satisfactory BUT the owner more than made up for it. Our waiter had said he'd package up my leftovers and never brought them back and we left without them. We returned about 10 minutes later because we realized we forgot and they had already been thrown away. The owner personally greeted us, apologized and offered to remake my meal for free for me to take home and have us drinks while we waited. Please patronize this wonderful restaurant! They truly know how to make a customer happy."}
{"text":"We arrived on time for our reservation but were not seated for 35 minutes. They made us stand around for 35 minutes outside, always telling us it would be another few minutes, and not a single effort was made to get us a table other than the one they had originally planned for us. Other than a brief and barely audible apology from our server to only one person in the party, we received nothing from the restaurant in the way of hospitality. Either the management was not aware of the situation or they didn't care enough to come to our table even once. 

Our server was very good and the food was ok, but the quality has dropped significantly in recent years. It used to be the best in the neighborhood (in my opinion), and this time our meal was very mediocre. Normally I would suggest giving it a chance to see if our experience was just an anomaly, but given other similar reports I've heard along with the lack of any hospitality standards, I'd recommend looking elsewhere in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"cute little place with pedestrian Italian food. The good: very taste meatballs and delicious warm bread. The mediocre: bolognese sauce was dry (how this happens I'm not sure) and lacked the richness and depth you want from a bolognese. the bad: the pasta was overcooked and seems like it comes from a box we could all buy at the super market. a true disappointment on the pasta front. that's just too big of a miss; we won't be back."}
{"text":"Everything that's been posted here is on the mark.  Calamai is superb - not fried, and served in a great sauce with just the right kick.  Perfect to sop up with their excellent fresh baked bread.  The four cheese ravioli was definitely worthy of the awards it has won.  I really enjoyed the sea scallops with squash and spinach.  The Cesar salad was the only slight disappointment -nothing special about it and we were surprised to find out that they charged a dollar to split it. We'll definitely return and given the fact that they were the most crowded spot on the hill -we're not alone!"}
{"text":"My fiancé and I were in the area and stopped by Mia Bella for dinner.  This was our first visit to this restaurant so we asked the waiter for some suggestions.  The waiter went into great detail about each section of the menu and suggested a plate from each section.

We took his advice and started with the eggplant parmesan and enjoyed every bite!  The portion was a bit small, but the perfect size for two people.  We followed that with an Albanian Salad which had romaine lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers, red onion, kalamata olives, and feta cheese.  It was dressed with a nice oil and vinegar based dressing.  We both enjoyed this as well.  Our main course was a Margarita pizza that might have been the best Margarita pizza I've ever had.  The pizza was about a 7\"-9\" pizza that was seasoned well with what appeared to be only fresh ingredients.  This certainly added to the fresh taste of the dish.

Finally, the waiter asked us if we would like anything for dessert, and being my fiancé's birthday I asked if they had any birthday candles.  He said \"that's all you need to say.\"  He returned with the entire wait staff singing happy birthday and providing my fiancé with a wonderful tiramisu.  The dessert was excellent, served in a single sized portion bowl with a very thick cream on top and moist cake on the bottom.  I could only get one bite before it was all gone.

We will certainly be back and plan on bringing friends and/or family with us to help promote this wonderful restaurant."}
{"text":"The food was so fresh; it amazed us. The sauces were a little too salty. Overall, from the eggplant appetizers to gnocchi to pizza, everything had a distinct, delightful taste."}
{"text":"Service: 10/10
Food: 9/10
Boyfriend and I went to Mia Bella for an early Sunday dinner. We called at 5 PM for a reservation at 6 PM. Arrived at 5:30, was greeted by a friendly hostess and seated right away. Water was filled immediately and waitress came over to take drink order. After ordering, she brought warm and crunchy bread with butter and olive oil. Bread was yummy!

We ordered arancini siciliani (Italian Rice & Veal Meatball) as an appetizer. Two big meatballs with DELICIOUS marinara sauce. Waitress brought more bread purposely for us to dip in the sauce and boy we cleaned that plate! We give it a 9/10
Boyfriend ordered house salad. Pretty good. 


I ordered the frutti di mare piccanti (fresh seafood over linguini, zucchini, grape tomatoes, and light marinara sauce). Of course I added extra fresh Parmesan on top! It's spicy but I love super spicy food so this was just perfect. Very fresh seafood, delicious taste of pasta cooked with seafood, just om nom nom! I was pretty much dancing after every bite. I give it a 9/10

The boyfriend had veal braciole (stuffed with chef secret ingredient over cavatell served with asparagus). Delicious. The two times we've been here, he's been getting this dish. 
Boyfriend gave 8/10. 

Had to box our leftover food, they box it for you! So delicious but we ate too much to be able to finish. 

Waitress was so friendly! Great service. And just delicious food! Our favorite place in little Italy! We even recommended the people walking behind us looking for a restaurant to eat to try this place, we hope they enjoyed it as much as we did ( I bet they loved it!). 
Will definitely keep coming back! :)"}
{"text":"Best restaurant we have tried in Little Italy. We are here every 6 months for Dr appt. The very best tomato sauce ever, the bread is to die for and the staff are friendly  and service wonderful. Don't waste $5 on house salad though--- bland needs some kick. Looking forward to returning in 6 months!  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"My wife and I have eaten here twice and both times we really loved the food.  The eggplant parm is unbelievable and I would definitely order the scallops again.  The staff is very helpful and friendly and we love the atmosphere.  We are looking forward to our next visit soon!"}
{"text":"Dined here for Valentine's Day and we had an excellent experience. Due to the crowd, we were seated late for our reservation. For this, Mia Bella offered us an appetizer in the house for our wait. That's great customer service. The meals were fantastic. The Mia Bella pasta with meatballs was perfect. I've had their desserts too and they're delicious as well. I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"We sat outside on a beautiful Friday afternoon/evening and watched the world go by. The food was very good - all the sauces seemed freshly made, the fish fresh, the portions good-sized, the tiramisu was especially yummy. The service was fine, maybe a little too attentive if you know what I mean, but that's better than being ignored. All around, just a good experience."}
{"text":"3.5 stars.

A reservation is highly recommended. My friend and I came without one and were lucky to be seated at the bar. The hostess and bartender were friendly and jovial. And overall, the restaurant is lively since the bar spans the entire depth of the dining room.

The gnocchi was perfectly cooked, but that was where the goodness ends. The sauce of any pasta dish is its life and soul. In this case, the gnocchi was a bit soulless. It was over-sauced with an all too sweet marinara. In addition, the chicken that I added to it was overcooked, dry, and flavorless. I know restaurants are afraid of salmonella, but that's no excuse for overcooked proteins."}
{"text":"Took out of town friends here. Fantastic!  They have been to Italy several times. They said it compares right up there."}
{"text":"I don't think I'm qualified to review the food at Mia Bella as we have only eaten here one time.  I will say that it seems like a good spot and we would try it again BUT
I have an issue with the lighting. When you are spending well north of $100 for dinner for two, you expect some semblance of ambiance along with that check.  I can get over how loud it is in Mia Bella on a Saturday night, but that-coupled with the intensely bright lighting, made me feel like I was at a local diner, or worse..Denny's. 

I urge you, Mia Bella, to lower the lighting.  It's a key component to a fine dining experience (which you are trying to be) but you are not giving it the attention it deserves.

If you lower it, we will be back, if not-not."}
{"text":"Not a great restaurant.  Décor is fine, food not so good.  We went for Sunday lunch.  Bruschetta was good.  Eggplant Parmesan too much sauce.  In general the cook is too liberal with salt.  Mia Bella Pizza - horrible, the crust is not chewy rather crispy.  Taste like premade, machine made.  Shrimp scampi - the shrimp was big  - sauce was not that good.  My son did like the veal.  However, his comparison is Bon Appetit caterer at the Case Western University!  Well for the price you pay, the kitchen can definitely do better.  Service was good."}
{"text":"Most amazing cheese tortellini dish I've ever had. Going back ASAP. My boyfriend got the Mia Bella pasta too and the marinara is out of this world. 

Great authentic Italian food."}
{"text":"Once again, Mia Bella did not disappoint!  From the service, to the appetizers, meals and wine, everything was wonderful!  Starting with the eggplant appetizer and the 4 cheese tortellini, the food was excellent.  The staff is super friendly and willing to give advice when asked.  I can't recommend this restaurant enough.  The food, atmosphere and service just don't get any better! Klaudio, our waiter, as always did a great job!"}
{"text":"What a fabulous little restaurant!  We were in Cleveland for my open heart surgery and I picked Mia Bella for my night-before-surgery meal with my wife, parents and best friend.  We had a reservation, which I recommend because this place is hopping. We were greeted warmly and seated promptly.  All of the food was excellent, but the hit of the night was the spicy cheese tortellini with added sausage.  Two of also had the lobster ravioli, which was very good, and the meatballs are fantastic as well!  All of left fat and happy and my surgery went great the next day.  So good, in fact, that I was released from the hospital on my 4th day post-op.  Well, I probably shouldn't have, but Mia Bella was so good that the first day I felt able to, 2 days after my release, my wife and I went back.  This time we were both thrilled with the marinara and meatball combination, me on the pasta Mia Bella and her on the cheese ravioli.  We ended with the most delicious and cute little cannolis for dessert.  Now tonight, our last night in Cleveland, we decided to give another place a chance, big mistake.  After being ignored for an hour at the place down the road, guess what?  Yep, back to Mia Bella for round 3!  Once again, she did not disappoint us.  We were welcomed warmly and tonight discovered one of the best bolognese sauces we've ever had, absolutely divine I say!  So if you want great food in little Italy, make a reservation at Mia Bella, it's fantastic!"}
{"text":"Our second visit here.  A.B. loved the eggplant app so much she ordered another double portion for dinner.  My Frutti de Mare Piccanti was excellent - almost as much seafood (mussels, shrimp and calamari) as pasta, in an extremely tasty spicy red sauce.  Prices were in line with rest of Little Italy.  The place was really hopping on the Sunday night of Labor Day weekend, which was great to see.  Only not completely positive aspect of our evening was the service - he was quite harried for most of the meal and mistakenly pitched our leftovers.  Notwithstanding, we'll definitely return."}
{"text":"Dishes are pricey for pasta (can be upwards of $25 per dish) but delicious and portions are generous!!

We went on a Sunday afternoon as soon as it opened and there was no line to be seated. The bread and butter were so good we asked for a second serving. The four of us tried three pasta dishes and a pizza and were impressed! If you love seafood, definitely recommend the Frutti di Picante? (the seafood one which was definitely more seafood than pasta :) ). Even the plain Mia Bella pasta with meatballs were amazing as well. The margherita pizza was good, not the best I've had though. The Mia Especiale with chicken was also pretty good. 

Definitely will come back when I feel like splurging!"}
{"text":"Best place to eat in Little Italy! It's a cozy Italian restaurant with seats indoors and outdoors. 
I only tried a couple things on their menu but now I always just order the cheese tortellini. Trust me- you won't be disappointed! Also, the portion is huge so you can always get it boxed up after."}
{"text":"Great amazing pasta! The food was authentic and tasty! 
Our server was a little pushy on upserving more expensive items and pushing getting more things, which was uneasy. My glass of wine wasn't the same the second time it came out as the first. Otherwise I would give 5 stars."}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite places in Little Italy. The food is great and the wait staff was amazing. Will be back :-)"}
{"text":"This was my first experience in little Italy and I must say it was an overall great one! Thank you yelpers for the great recommendation. Our service, food, and drinks were all fantastic. We ordered the baked veggies with chorizo sausage. Non traditional, but spicy and tasty! I personally ordered the cheese tortellini and it changed my life. Ok maybe I'm being dramatic, but seriously there's some kind of food drug in that sucker. Flipping delicious. I was happy to take the leftovers home to enjoy that savory, succulent delight once again. Our waiter was honestly one of the best waiters I've had in a long time. He made great recommendations and was very assertive and friendly. Our meal took a long time, this is the one downer of the meal, but he was very apologetic and gave us a free round of drinks and dessert to go, which was totally awesome but not necessary. He was very professional and we appreciated his excellent service. The restaurant itself was packed on this Friday night at 8:30pm. It has a quaint, cozy, and family oriented feel to it. When we first walked in we were greeted and seated by an older italian woman. She was so sweet and impressionable, which was a nice start to the meal and night. Overall, Mia Bella was absolutely delicious. It is a bit pricy, but you get what you pay for here with the great service and yummy eats. I forgot to mention the decadent flour less chocolate cake we took to go. It was every girls dream, well at least every reasonable girl with high standards :)"}
{"text":"Thank You Mia Bella for a wonderful Christmas Eve dinner. Service was fantastic and the food was delicious. The eggplant app and pizza app were perfect as well as the bread!  Our group of four had ravioli, basic pasta and meatballs, and the carbonara special...huge portions!  Just a great experience and we will be back on a regular basis!"}
{"text":"Food are so good. I went there for one time and ordered the homemade pasta and Lamb kaba and didn't have much expectations on them, because I was hungry, and didn't have a reservation, so I have to finish my dinner quick so that I can leave before the guys who had the reservation arrived. However, the food is surprisingly good, and my wife and I are very happy about the experience. The only thing need to pay attention is it may need to have a reservation before going. I was able to have dinner there only because the servant were so kind that she let us on as long as we can promise to finish the dinner quick."}
{"text":"My husband and I dropped in on a busy Saturday evening with no reservation (reservations HIGHLY recommended) anyway, luckily we got there at the perfect time since a table they were holding a reservation for were no shows so we luckily got a table. Staff was very friendly and accommodating. The calamari was so good!! I was nervous since it's not breaded but was fantastic. My husband got the steak and I got the cheese tortellini both were excellent dishes. Topped it all off with gelato yum! We will definitely be back! Yes it's a bit pricier than most places but good portion size and well worth it!"}
{"text":"A gem in the restaurant haven that is Little Italy. Mia Bella has nice portion sizes and great service. The menu has a nice mix of standard Italian offerings and a fantastic boneless ribeye with grilled asparagus and peppers. The gravy for the pasta dishes is excellent and the pasta itself was perfectly al dente. The bartender's give an excellent pour to customers. 

My first stop the next time I'm back in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Everything was fine. The food was good, the staff was prompt, the outside patio (could use some work) was fine. Having said that there are a bunch of other places to eat at with price points of $10~$20 that offers more value than Bella's $20~$30."}
{"text":"I always love coming here when I'm in Little Italy. I ordered the fried eggplant appetizer and a cup of the seafood soup as a meal, and it was plenty of food. There was a lot more cheese than eggplant in the first dish, not that it made it any less good as a result! 
The \"cup\" of soup was really a giant bowl (no complaints there!). Can't imagine what the bowl size looks like! The tomato-based broth was very tangy and tasty and had lots of mussels, squids, and a shrimp in it. I will definitely order the soup again the next time I go here!"}
{"text":"The Italian food took me right back to Italy!
The homemade marinara sauce is so delicious. I can say the eggplant parm and the cheese ravioli with fried avocado are fabulous! Finished with the flourless chocolate cake and a glass of cab for a perfect dinner. We ate at the bar and Sonny gave us excellent service! Will definitely be going back when craving an authentic Italian experience and missing Italy."}
{"text":"What a great place in Little Italy! Love the food and quaint atmosphere! The Lobster Ravioli or Grilled Scallops are a must have!"}
{"text":"Came to Case Western University for the college tour and we were recommended to go to little Italy and this place was recommended on yelp and by our guide tour.
Service excellent. Food was fair. My shrimp on my pesto pasta was very salty. Prices are little high for the portions. Just average. The bathroom needs major cleaning and TLC. For real Italian food go to NYC."}
{"text":"Excellent Italian food with great ambience in a beautiful, Italian neighborhood. I highly recommend the cheese tortellini with prosciutto. The sauce was very tasty with a little kick, but not too much of one. I would have given 5 stars, but the seating was a little cramped. Definitely not a reason to miss out on such great food though."}
{"text":"All I can say is wow.
This food was BRILLIANT.
Just when I thought Im not going to have a lot of fun in Cleveland I saw this little Italy corner when I was talking a walk with my man, and we stopped and tried a few different spots, and this one DELIVERED.

We had a pizza and a pasta, and they were smashing. I believe that this restaurant can't make mistakes when it comes to Italian food, if I am ever in Cleveland again I am definitely going to go back to this place, it's gorgeous, the staff is kind, the food is great and on top of all of this, THEY PLAY JAZZ! 

Sorry about geeking out, I am after all a jazz vocalist :)"}
{"text":"If I could give more than 5 stars I would. Best Italian around. The calamari, shrimp saganaki, veal stuffed peppers are unbelievable appetizers. Bolognese, Fruitte de marre and tortellini are drool worthy. 

The service is impeccable. I request my fruitte de marre without pasta and they have accommodated every time. The servers and bartenders make an effort to remember your name and face. It's like walking into your family's home. 

My only complaint is that I'm always so full and satisfied when I leave. I can't get enough!"}
{"text":"Make sure you get the bread. Its to die for! I had the lobster ravioli and it was amazing too! My husband had the chicken risotto and loved it."}
{"text":"Oh all the deities in the universe. Fantastic! I keep a list of best things I've ever eaten, their Scampi Pappardelle is definitely going on the list. Shrimp, tomatoes, zucchini, spinach, fresh roasted garlic, scallions. Cooked to perfection. Deliciously spicy. Of my entire trip to Cleveland this was definitely the highlight. Even their Caesar salad, which is just a regular old salad was delicious."}
{"text":"Ate at the bar. Food was great. We split the Mia Bella salad and the Mia Bella pasts. Had some wine and visited with bar tender. Great afternoon lunch."}
{"text":"amazing, my favorite in little italy. the clarity of the food matches the taste. well worth the prices."}
{"text":"We had a really nice al fresco meal here last Friday night.  The service was excellent, the food quality was very high, the salad was fresh, the bread was warm, and the tortellini was fabulous!  The loss of a star comes from the terrible, borderline non-existent parking options.  I know there is little that can be done to alleviate that but be prepared to park blocks away and walk."}
{"text":"I have been here many times, and it's always great. When we bring the whole family, we have a large group with a wide range of tastes, from vegan to heavy meat eaters; and several people whose ordering is complicated due to special diets and allergies. Service has always been EXCELLENT! Servers are knowledgable about ingredients and willing to check with the chef if they are uncertain about anything. The chef is willing to alter recipes or suggest alternatives for people with allergies. And the food is always fresh and delicious, whether straight off the menu or something invented for particular needs."}
{"text":"Amazing and quick service, delicious food, beautiful environment. The waitress serving us was spectacular. The food was amazing and fresh yet didn't take long to come. I definitely recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Really tasty food. I ordered the four cheese tortellini, with spinach and tomatoes for dinner and the raspberry cheesecake gelato for dessert. The dinner was delicious, the dessert was amazing. Excellent wine as well. I sat at the bar, so my service was from the bartenders. They were friendly, quick and helpful. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Wow- loved the award-winning shrimp appetizer and the eggplant appetizer. For those who eat Gluten Free, enjoy the perfectly cooked Pasta Bolognese!"}
{"text":"I highly recommend eating at Mia Bella in the quaint area of Little Italy in CLE. The service is so so quick, you will have tasty bowls of pasta in front of you before you know it. 

I have had the pasta with a tomato cream sauce, I forget what it was called, but I add mushrooms because I don't eat meat! They are totally accommodating and the portions are huge. I've always taken it home and it's perfectly delicious the next day. On another note, the bread is delicious and the butter has oregano in it, which is so cool and tasty. 

Definitely check out Mia Bella! Make a reservation, just to be safe!"}
{"text":"The girlfriend and I were in Cleveland from out of town and the bartender at our hotel suggested this location as the best Italian restaurant around and she was right! We got there around 8 on a Friday night and it was insanely busy buuuuut the owner, bartenders and servers were super friendly even those they were all super busy. I went with the pasta verde and I definitely made the right decision. Now some of the Clevelander's were below par but I can't count that against the restaurant."}
{"text":"Excellent food and great service.  We bounced in here shortly before they closed the kitchen and they stayed open for us.  I only tasted the Caesar salad and it was very good.  Friends ordered the Frutti di Mari and said it was outstanding.  I walked past the place last night on the way to Mama Santa's and it was packed.  I definitely want to go back when I am really hungry!"}
{"text":"Wonderful experience. My family sat indoors due to construction but it was a great experience and the food was delicious. Parking is tough even though we went at noon on a Saturday."}
{"text":"We had such a great dinner here.
Started with a Blue crab crostini. The blue crab mix was so delicious , we ordered 2 plates. Kids loved them too!
Also eggplant appetizer. Another kids' favorite.
The tomato sauce was just right.
For main we had seafood pasta, cheese tortellini ( award winner), pizza , and ravioli. 
They were not too salty, and delicious!
We are so much, and had no space left for dessert..,,
Highly recommended for small to big group."}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to visiting Little Italy and decided to try a new place. I got a parking spot right on the side of Mia Bella and sat down at one of the outdoor tables on the sidewalk. They bring me water and the menu. I am ready to order when the stuffy Hostess comes over and says \"did someone seat you\" I said \"no I sat myself\" shw said \"I'm sorry we only have opening at the bar\" I said \"I wanted to sit outdoors\" she says \"we don't have enough wait staff\" yet there were customers sitting 2 tables away. So I walk across the street and sit at their outdoor tables. 10 minutes later Miss Stuffy Hostess sits a couple at the table I was just at. I had a great pizza across the street and the owner came out twice to check on me.I won't be back to Mia Bella anyyime soon. But La Dolce Vita has earned my business."}
{"text":"Came here for an early dinner one Saturday and OH IT WAS HOPPING. The restaurant opens at 4:30 for dinner, and by 4:25 there was already a queue of people out the door. And my friend and I thought we were the only crazies who wanted to eat that early. By 4:40 the entire restaurant was packed and stayed that way our entire meal. Moral of the story: unless you're willing to get there early, make a reservation. 

FOOD: We split the calamari appetizer and the baked veggies pasta. Both were decent but neither blew my mind. The calamari is very different from traditional calamari dishes. This isn't breaded and fried, but rather sautéed in a slightly spicy tomato sauce with zucchini. Pretty good and not too heavy. The portions were extremely generous and we had plenty left over. Oh and the bread is excellent. Just saying. 

SERVICE: Can I just say how ON TOP of everyone's game this place was? Once we were seated we were immediately served water and greeted by our server (Ryan I think). Our food came quickly and our waters were constantly refilled. As in, I don't think my water was allowed to drop to less than halfway full before being topped off. I can appreciate that.

I did notice how quickly this place turns over tables. The family next to us was served and finished their meal before we even got our entrees. 

In summary, this is a great, affordable place for a casual meal."}
{"text":"From the service to the food, MBR has it all. We went here for my birthday meal prior to catching the orchestra at severance hall and it did not disappoint. Located at the corner of Mayfield and Murray hill, the second we walked in we were greeted by the host and sat at our seats. I highly recommend a reservation.

The seating is cozy but not crowded. I didn't feel cramped for space like many restaurants in little Italy. The wine list has great choices and our waiter gave us a great bottle of silver oak. It was national pizza day so we went with a pepperoni pizza that is enough to be an appetizer for two or a meal for one.

For main courses, we went with the award winning spicy tortellini and the pasta Verde. They lived up to the reviews. I loved the tortellini and added some red pepper flakes for even more kick. My wife loves the pasta Verde which was a delicious pestso pasta with veggies. Solid portions and plenty of sauce for bread dipping.  

Out the door with a 20%+ tip for less than 100$. Walked down to severance hall in less than 20 mins. The only down side is parking, which is the obstacle for any restaurant near university circle/little Italy. You can circle for off street parking, but we just paid up for a lot closer to euclid avenue which came to 15$ for 5 or 6 hours."}
{"text":"We went here a little after lunchtime on a Friday.  The decor and service was good.  I got the Cheese Tortellini and it was delicious."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the cheese ravioli.  The roasted beet salad with walnuts and feta was wonderful.  Would highly recommend trying this place in Little Italy."}
{"text":"I travel a lot for work and am always checking yelp for good places to eat and this was AMAZING!  Had the shrimp saganaki, mussels and the ravioli.  Service was fantastic too!  You must try!"}
{"text":"This is seriously amazing Italian food, possibly the best in Little Italy. I discovered it when I was working in the library at school, and suddenly this waft of garlicky, wine-y, seafood amazingness drifted towards me. Instead of telling the patron to please take their food outside, as I'm supposed to, I asked where it came from, and left the patron right there so I could enjoy the smell some more! Needless to say, it was Mia Bella's seafood pasta, and I knew I had to go immediately. 
The restaurant is elegant inside, and our waitress was friendly, albeit a little clumsy. We ordered the shrimp saganaki and upon delivery, she spilled my drink into it! But she quickly rushed away to fix the problem and the order was ready again soon. The shrimp is a must-order dish. They are fresh and juicy, and the sauce is the creamiest marinara/alfredo concoction with a hint of spice. Also, the tortellini, although it sounds pretty plain, is so flavorful and the pasta dough is so fresh! I have to go back here asap!"}
{"text":"Be sure to make a reservation - even for early evening hours they can be full. The service has always been good here - in the dining room, bar, or patio. The food is very good - they've won numerous awards. Don't miss the shrimp saganaki appetizer - it's the best!"}
{"text":"Went here a year ago, really awesome food for very low prices. We both at full meals plus a drink for $30-35, with great service!"}
{"text":"I can't rate this place high enough. I was in the area for the weekend and Mia Bella came highly recommended by a few friends. I called on a Saturday night around 8 pm asking if a table for 3 was available. I was literally a block away at the time calling while parking. The waitress took my name and said she would hold the table. We walked in and sure enough the table was ready for us. We received very prompt and friendly service right off the bat. I ordered the Mia Bella martini (vodka and lemonade with a couple blueberries and a raspberry) and it was FANTASTIC. We started off with the shrimp saganaki as an app, HOLY HELL is this dish fantastic. The shrimp were large and the sauce it was in was to die for. I ordered the fettuccine carbonara and couldn't have been happier. My brother ordered the Frutti di Mare Piccanti, i tried a few bites and it was also wonderful. I think my mom might have had the best flavored dish, she ordered the pesto. All of our dishes were extremely full of flavor and delicious. I would recommend this place to everyone in the little Italy area of Cleveland. I can't wait to go back. The service was top of the line as well."}
{"text":"Excellent dinner! Service was top notch. Food was incredible from appetizer to dessert all eight if us thoroughly enjoyed all of our food and experience."}
{"text":"Came here to celebrate end of school year.  Restaurant ambiance is nice, on Monday night, half empty.  Waitress was very attentive and pleasant. Food is okay.  

As you can see from pic from previous reviewer, everything is drenched w. sauce.  I had grilled sea scallops, which was smothered and overpowered w. tomato sauce. Couldn't even tell it was grilled.   We wanted calamari, but they only served it steamed not fried...hmm what Italian restaurant doesn't have fried calamari?  Also, no baked clams..... The best dish was the steam mussels in wine.  We also had the Cheese Ravioli, which was average.  I would not yearn to come back here.  We ordered one dessert and we shared w. 4 people and did not finish because it wasn't that good.  Very sweet, can't even remember what it was called, some caramel hard shell topping thingy.  

We were seated near the back and I could smell the bathroom... I turned around and noticed that the Men's room door was ajar.  I asked the waitress very nicely to close it and she was very accommodating and apologized, but it kinda turned me off.  The servers walked passed the bathroom to the kitchen constantly, so you woulda thought they would of noticed the smell.  Nothing turns me off like seeing a toilet in my view in a restaurant, let alone smelling it."}
{"text":"High ratings brought us out to Mia Bella for late lunch today.  I got the scampi risotto, my husband got the ribeye with roasted vegetables.   The portions were HUGE.  Seasoning (salt) was a bit lacking.  The scampi were huge and lovely. The ribeye was reported to be scrumptious, and the potatoes and roasted veggies had great flavor as well.  Will we go back? Most likely.  Prices were high, but offset by massive portions.  We don't drink, but the bar was well stocked and the wine list extensive."}
{"text":"My Son and I stopped by last week for dinner last week.... We really enjoyed sitting outside... The Calamari was the best i have had since I was in Italy in 2006. Great meal and service... Thank you for the great dining experience, Marco M."}
{"text":"Stopped here during my first visit to Little Italy and it was fantastic. My friend and I were sat rather quickly outside on the patio without reservations. Our waitress, however, was in quite a rush and would look everywhere but you when talking. Even though she was unpleasant, our food was amazing. We ordered the linguine bianco and cheese tortellini; both of us were at a loss for words. The two pasta dishes were delicious and very authentic. One of my favorite new restaurants in the area, despite the server."}
{"text":"I came here with a group of co workers and had an amazing dining experience. We ordered some appetizers to split and had the calamari and mussels. Both were delicious. The bread and butter came with the meal and were replaced as necessary. The butter came in a bed of olive oil so you could choose to dip your bread in either. 

Tip: The \"calamari\" here is probably not what you think. It's not a pile of fried squid. Rather, it's squid in a tomato/lemon broth with garlic and onions. It was very yummy and a refreshing new way to have calamari at an Italian restaurant. 

I ordered the paste e prosciutto, which was delicious. The pasta was fresh tasting and was in a robust tomato sauce with olives and prosciutto. I loved the flavor combination. The portion size was more than enough for me. 

We had tiramisu for dessert, which was yummy but not the best I've had. One portion size is enough for two people to split. If they are open, I would suggest going to one of the nearby bakeries for dessert (Prestis or Corbos) instead. 

Overall, I had a great dining experience here. I felt that the food here was more \"Mediterranean\" than some of the other Italian joints. Loved it!"}
{"text":"Never disappoints. Been there several times. Best bread anywhere. Make sure you try the garlic butter that comes with it. Make sure you ask for it. Pasta very good. Waiter excellant. Great value."}
{"text":"Good solid food great service.  We enjoyed our meal and wouldn't hesitate to come back.

We had the mussels and were surprised that the portion was larger than we expected.  Also had the antipasto and that was great.

I had the tortellini which was good.  My son n got the eggplant parm.  There were three small pieces of parm and he wasn't all that thrilled.  My wife got the bolognse and loved it.  My younger son got the pepperoni pizza and enjoyed it as well.

Nice Location.  We walked over from university circle and it was only a mile.

We didn't do desert as we wanted to check out some of the bakeries in the area.

The only reason I didn't rate it higher is my father in law is from Italy and his food is amazing."}
{"text":"Had the cheese ravioli with chicken yesterday. The chicken was so salty I almost couldn't eat it. Don't intend to every go back."}
{"text":"I love the food at Mia Bella. I have always had an excellent experience there. However I just went there tonight for my birthday and the service was horrible. Our waitress was very nice but we spent almost 2 hours there total because of the wait for food and drinks. We received not compensation for this wait either, which the waitress apologized for so she knew it was bad. I have never waited so long for food and drinks before. The least they could have done was offer a free birthday dessert but they didn't even acknowledge it was birthday after we told the waitress in the beginning. Again, I love the food here but being ignored for over a half hour at a time and spending two hours total at a restaurant was not my ideal of a fun birthday dinner."}
{"text":"So this meal was (for me) the biggest \"dud\" of Cleveland.

The appetizers were promising, be sure and get the eggplant parm, I wish I had just gotten that and a side of meatballs for dinner (rather than an entrée).

The portions of pasta could feed a small nation, and I got the feeling the waiters upsell everyone to get a protein with their pasta, I got the  \"spicy\" cheese tortellini with (upgrade of) sausage - the sausage was very dry and sliced (I prefer my sausage in pasta to be de-cased and in crumbles).  The pasta was pretty flavorless and one-note. (not spicy at all).

My husband got the pasta Bolognese with (another suggested upgrade) of meatballs. The meatballs were far better than the sausage, but I didn't really understand why anyone would even suggest meatballs as an upgrade for a meaty pasta - just seemed like they are running an \"upgrade protein scam\" (not really, but...)

The other gripe I have is the \"valet\" - and I saw this exact situation in another review. we pulled up to the valet station and they just left our car there for $7...

Apparently they just expanded the space and we were seated in the expanded part which has a huge TV with close-captioned dramas on TV (I suppose I could understand if it was a big important sports game - but this was a low light room in a pretty pricey restaurant - I don't want to stare at a huge plasma screen while I eat- I can do that at home)"}
{"text":"I tried this place because of the yelp reviews and like everyone else I totally agree! The food is favorable, service is great (20 min wait), and the ambiance was perfect. The weather was just warming up and we were able to sit outside. 

I highly recommend the Chef's Favorite pizza. The pizza surprised me and I will have to go back and try other selections. I also got the Mia Bella Pasta with Chicken, the pasta tasted great but I do have to say the chicken was a bit dry. This is a pricier restaurant but I do think you get your money's worth."}
{"text":"I went to this place with my boyfriend for a Sunday night dinner, and I absolutely loved loved it!! I cannot say enough good things about this restaurant, the decor was absolutely beautiful, food was delicious, drinks were great and the waiter was excellent! This was the first restaurant I had ever been to in Cleveland, it's a spot in little Italy and it's so cute! We got a cozy table right beside the window, and it was just us. The whole night we could see outside and look through the window to the pretty street outside, it was super romantic. I highly recommend this spot to couples for Valentine's day or even a first date!

This is was hands down the best Italian food (pasta) I've ever had! I cannot rave about it enough. We had complimentary bread and butter, Cesar salad as a starter and for dinner - we ordered the veggie penne with grilled chicken and the pasta with homemade marinara sauce and grilled chicken. Seriously, best pasta and sauces I've ever had! I highly recommend this place to anyone and everyone who is a pasta and Italian food lover like me! The drinks weren't on the menu, they were specials cocktails that were equally delicious, and they have an extensive wine collection too. I cannot wait to go back and try everything else on the menu!! Keep up the good work guys, see you soon. :)"}
{"text":"I ordered the pizza with the artichokes and smoked provolone, had to be the best pizza I've every had,  cute place too !  you gotta check it out"}
{"text":"Delicious meal of roasted beet, goat cheese and walnut salad with cheese tortellini and their spicy sauce... Book a table or you will wait!"}
{"text":"Average at best. Not authentic Italian in any conceivable way. It's OK. That's all."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing. The place was pretty packed for a Monday night. The bartenders were helpful about the menu and pointed me to the award winning cheese tortellini. Do it. Don't ask questions, just do it. Roasted tomatoes, garlic in a cream sauce with little pockets of cheese goodness. Phenomenal. Definitely give it a try. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"We have been planning a trip to little Italy since moving to Cleveland last May.  Mia Bella is by far the restaurant everyone recommends!  The Service, ambiance, salads sauces and pasta were fantastic.  
We showed up on Easter at 4:00 without a reservation and they accommodated us even with a full reservation list starting at 5pm.  My husband had linguini marinara with meatballs on the side and  I had the Mediterranean salad loaded with veggies, calabata olives and feta.  Fresh, crisp and flavorful.  The MIA Bella Cheese tortellini was heavenly, good amount of procciuto, fresh peas and just the right kick of spice.  The only reason we are giving 4 stars is the meatballs were quite small for the price/serving also they were a bit over worked and mealy."}
{"text":"Fantastic food!  Cute setting.  Would love to go back.  Polenta is amazing!  Totally recommend!"}
{"text":"This was my first time in little Italy and I am quite impressed with this restaurant. 

Great atmosphere with inside or outside dining and mood setting music. The staff was very prompt, polite, and courteous. Being a first timer, the waitress answered our questions and made some excellent recommendations. 

Food was fresh and very well prepared. Tomato avocado bruschetta was a simple and delicious appetizer. I had the \"Award Winning\" Cheese Tortellini which is their best seller. Very good, I can see why it has won awards."}
{"text":"AMAZING Italian food! This restaurant is a gem in Cleveland and a must go to for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Went out with my girlfriends for a lovely night out. We went to Cleveland's Little Italy for some real, delicious Italian food! It was such a nice evening, in the middle of October too, that we were able to sit outside and eat. We started off with a couple of appetizers: eggplant parmesan, a seasonal balsamic and mozzarella combo, and seasonal clams. So yummy! The eggplant parmesan was the best appetizer we had; you could not even tell it was eggplant! The seasonal balsamic and mozzarella combo was quite tasty too. While they gave a heaping plate of clams, my main complaint with that dish was that it was way too salty. I ordered a nice little mini bottle of Moscato with my food that was quite delicious. I ordered the Cheese Tortellini as my main entree and you HAVE TO GET THIS! The sauce is a delicious blend of the traditional white and red sauces. It was hard to not lick the plate clean! I also got an order of meatballs too as my protein for the dish. It was a little bit odd that they put the meatballs in a marinara sauce, which is a different sauce that my tortellini came in. And throughout our whole dinner, classic Italian music was being played. It was such a romantic atmosphere I wish the fiancee was with me!


Pros:
- delicious pasta/pizza dishes
- reasonably priced
- outside seating available if the weather permits

Cons:
- my clam appetizer was way too salty, but they did give a huge portion of clam4


Why I gave it a 4...
I wish I lived closer to Cleveland so I could come back again ASAP! This is a true gem of a restaurant in Little Italy! Delicious food with a great atmosphere of sitting outside while listening to romantic Italian music. Would love to come back here with fiancee or for another girl's night out!"}
{"text":"A great place large gatherings. The servers were friendly and helpful with the menu. The prices are pretty fair for being in little Italy. Ordered the Mia Bella pasta with meatballs. The meatballs were homemade and quite flavorful. Well worth the extra add on price. Call ahead for reservations as it can fill up quickly."}
{"text":"Wow! What a fabulous spot in the heart of little Italy! 
The food service atmosphere were outstanding. Dan was out waiter and spectacular! Bravo! 
p.s. DAN great hands are fabulous! 
The Bergdoll's loved evening and meal. 
Top shelf."}
{"text":"Great food, great service(a bit slow), and ambiance.  We were visiting schools in the area and stopped by for lunch.  Weather was perfect so we ate outside.  I really felt like I was in Italy even though we were in the Midwest!"}
{"text":"Excellent taste, portions, service. We arrived at 5pm to a mostly empty dining room but our server was extremely focused on us. She provided recommendations on wine and food, and we followed her lead. Loved the Chianti (stick with the $6 glass) and the award-winning shrimp sagnaki appetizer. The meatball (not as it's listed on the menu, but I can't remember what it was called) was flavorful and excellent sauce. We split the cheese tortellini and loved it as well, the sauce was similar to what was on the shrimp appetizer. Yelp directed me correctly on this one. I would definitely return!"}
{"text":"First and favorite Italian restaurant in Cleveland. The hype is really on point. The warm bread that comes out is so good, I could eat a whole loaf if they let me."}
{"text":"A total disappointment. Definitely NOT what you would expect from a restaurant in Little Italy. Wanted to try a new place instead of going to our favorite place (Angelo's Nido Italia), BIG MISTAKE. The service was poor and the meal was awful. Had a 5:30 reservation on a Friday evening, we were seated and waited 20 mins for a waitress to approach our table. The place was nearly empty, only two other tables with customers, so no excuse. We waited another 20 mins for our drinks (2 Peroni Beers $12) and appetizer. The appetizer (Shrimp Saganaki $13.95) was the ONLY good part of the meal (very tasty). We had to ask the waitress for bread (doubt we would have gotten it if we didn't ask), and didn't get it until we were done with our appetizer. Never asked if we wanted more bread with our dinner. We ordered two entrées Linguini Bolognese ($15.49) & Veal Braciole ($28.49). The LINGUINI Bolognese was served with very thin cheap grocery store boxed spaghetti and a sauce that tasted like something from a jar. When asked about why the dish was served with spaghetti we were told it wasn't spaghetti it was a \"thinner linguini noodle\". Seriously??? Both the waitress and server insisted until we became angry that they were lying to us. At which point the waitress confessed that they didn't have any linguini and made the substitution. Would have liked to have been told this when placing the order. The Veal Braciole was tough and dry, lacking in flavor (the chefs special stuffing was not all that). The sauce was typical \"jar\" tasting sauce, definitely NOT homemade. The side of gluten free pasta was a horrible cheap boxed grocery store brand, which they charged an additional $2 for (I guess it took a lot of effort to open the box). There was no mention on the menu or by the waitress about the up charge. The total dining experience was awful. It cost $87.68 (with $10 tip, not sure why my husband was so kind). Will NEVER go back to Mia Bella and would not recommend it to others. As a REAL ITALIAN (first generation), I know real authentic Italian food and this place does not serve it. I can honestly say the food at Mia Bella is an embarrassment to Cleveland's awesome Little Italy."}
{"text":"We had a lovely dinner here this week! The ambience is quite nice and reminded us of Italy. Our waiter was solicitous but not overbearing and everything we ordered was bellisimo!! We would return!"}
{"text":"Came for a friends birthday lunch- cheese tortellini was indeed an award winner, pizza was fine, fish of the day salmon with veggies good, grilled veggies and pasta were okay... The birthday platter with chocolate mousse bomb and four cannolis were decorated with candles and servers sang to wish the birthday lady- so the experience had a good finale. Cannolis were horrible as there was this \"synthetic\" after taste which was disgusting. The Chico dessert was okay, nothing great. Overall, it was not too busy on a Friday afternoon... Ambience was okay too... Found parking couple of blocks away easily. The lunch menu was totally confusing as all dishes/varieties were mixed up and for first timers we were all baffled."}
{"text":"More hip new restaurants are being added to the suddenly trendy University Circle neighborhood but  this weekend I had my sights set on one of Cleveland's original foodie destinations -- Little Italy.
We knew we'd be eating on the early side since the Museum of Art closed at 5 so we'd figured we could find a place without reservations. And sure enough, Mia Bella welcomed us with open arms.
Many restaurants in the area are quite small or dark and closed up to generate a cozy (or possibly claustrophobic) feeling. But Mia Bella generates a breathable, open dining room with high ceilings, large windows and non-clunky furniture. The airy ambiance is even more impressive considering they have packed in quite a few tables (and a bar) in the rectangular space.
One of the things I look forward to at a Little Italy restaurant are the wait staffs. They have the perfect blend of politeness and attentiveness yet with a slight, almost unprofessionalism, which makes you feel like your sitting down as a guest at a family dinner table instead of a stuffy, snobbish restaurant.
And Mia Bella's waiters and waitresses did not disappoint. They were checking in on us at just the exact moment one of us would feel like we might need something, like more wine, more bread, etc. And our waitress was happy to chat with us and seemed to really care how we enjoyed the food.
The wine list was decent with numerous options from across the globe (though I wonder who would sit down in Little Italy and feel the need for an Australian red). We went with a basic Chianti and thought it pared well with our meal.
As an appetizer, we got the Arancini Siciliani ($9) and it was quite different than what we're used to. The Arborio rice, the cheese and the fried outer coating were all there but mixed in with it was quite a bit of veal and some mushrooms so it tasted more like a meatball. And here's a warning: The marinara sauce was quite spicy and it had us reaching for our water and wine with almost every bite. In fact it had even quite a bit more heat than my main course which was advertised as spicy on the menu.
As for the main course, I ordered the Frutti di Mare Piccanti ($23) and got exactly what I expected - a heaping pile of seafood and pasta with a light tomato sauce serving as an accent to the dish instead of smothering it to death.
The shrimp, calamari and mussels were perfectly cooked, offering just enough  chewiness to balance the softness of the pasta.
As for the light marinara sauce, when my wife tried a spoonful she tasted acid and thought there might have been a touch of lemon in it but I think it was that the sauce was so fresh it was the tomatoes' acidity shining through.
I was left wishing there was more pasta to go with all the shellfish (Yea, I know, Rich People problems).
My wife had the Pasta Verdi with shrimp ($21) and it also tasted delicious. The server cautioned their verde sauce is creamier than what one normally expects so I was expecting more of an alfredo sauce but no, it was still quite light.
We passed on dessert to grab something from Corbo's to eat later (but that's a review for another day).
Overall, I can easily recommend Mia Bella's to anyone looking for a place to check out in Little Italy."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! And the staff was super friendly. The waiter recommended a shrimp appetizer, eggplant parmasian and an entree which included fried calamari, shrimp and mussels in a spicy sauce. Everything was delicious and perfectly cooked. I recommend dipping the bread in the sauce that comes with the spicy shrimp! It's to die for! This restaurant has a great atmosphere. A must try if you are in Little Italy. Parking may be a bit hard on a weekend, but it's worth it for sure! I would definitely recommend reservations also, just to make sure you don't have to wait. Although keep in mind they don't always answer their phone on the first try because they don't have a hostess."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is nice, but as a real Italian (born and grown up in Italy for 28 years) there is nothing actually Italian in the menu. Too much garlic and heavy cream in each dish."}
{"text":"Ended up here on a thursday night.  One of, if not the best, meal I have ever had.  Had Calimari  and a muscle appetizer, both were out of this world.  Had the stuffed veal dinner, fantastic.  Definitely would recommend to anyone looking for a good Italian meal!!!"}
{"text":"So good! Visiting Case Western Reserve University and got recommendation for this restaurant in Little Italy.  Nice ambience.  Bread comes on request and you definitely need to do that.  It had great crust and came with soft butter drizzled with olive oil.  Hadn't seen that before but I liked the combo.  
      My house salad was just right and had pieces of mozzarella cheese and a large slice of a flavorful tomato that I have to guess was vine-ripened.  
      It was my pizza that pushed me into rating this restaurant a 5. It was a 9 inch \"Four Seasons\" single serve.  Toppings were Mushrooms, Kalamata Olives, Artichoke and Fresh Tomatoes.  It was excellent!  A nice cabernet completed my meal at $6 a glass.  Overall, a thoroughly wonderful meal right down to the good service.  I looked at the dessert menu and lots of yummy things that will have to wait for next time."}
{"text":"Hearty dishes, authentic Italian, great for out of towers!  We visited Cleveland last week and ate there early in the week.  The food and service were so fantastic that we returned on Friday on our last full day there.  Not only was the food amazing, but our server (Samantha) was extremely pleasant, knowledgeable and responsive.   A great place for an Italian meal, and Little Italy is a fun, walkable, Main Street environment!"}
{"text":"Went here on a recommendation and was not disappointed. I had the veal ravioli and it was so tasty! The parking is a bit of a pain and my husband and i had to drive around for quite awhile before we could find a spot, but once inside we were in love!"}
{"text":"how is this place featured in every yelp search I do ? it's mediocre. 
It was not terrible but not very good- just meh.

From the best italian restaurant at the heart of \"little Italy\" I guess i was expecting more. Most of the food felt like it is warmed and pasta sauces were uneventful.

it's ok. nothing more"}
{"text":"Hot peppers. Calamari. Wine. A little crowded and tables a little close but the food is very good."}
{"text":"The food and service were exceptional. We enjoyed the cheese ravioli and the scallops. Their bread was delicious! I highly recommend Mia Bella. Great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Back again.  This time Cesar salad was perfect.
Wife and I both had eggplant parm which here is delicate and delicious.
Side of linguine with garlic and oil prepared to perfection.
Service was friendly and reasonably quick.
Can't beat this place for sophisticated preparation of the basics at good price.
Have yet to find another place in \"Little Italy\" that can measure up."}
{"text":"Recommended by hotel staff.  Seated fairly quickly.  Waitress friendly when taking order.  Then the wheels fell off.  Waited 1 hour and 10 minutes for order to come out.  Waitress ignored us. When I finally flagged her down after nearly an hour, she said food would be right out. Tried to flag down maitre'd, made eye contact, but she walked by pretending she did not see or hear me.   Twenty minutes later, finally flagged waitress down again, and asked for check so we could leave.  She said food would be right out, and it was, finally, about 5 minutes later.  Food was mediocre for price, and chicken was so dry it was nearly inedible.  No explanation, apology, or attempt to make things right.  Wished I had gone to a fast food restaurant."}
{"text":"I was impressed when they served very delicious warm bread before the meal. Most places do not even serve warm bread! The garlic spread they provided was very good. Also, they provided very attentive service (my glass was never empty) and Carl, our waiter was very nice. He recommended the four seasons pizza and chefs favorite. I like the chefs favorite - pesto based with chorizo spicy sausage. The four seasons was more of a vegetarian pizza. You can also walk around Little Italy afterwards."}
{"text":"Great service and food!  Michael the bartender was courteous, prompt, and continually checked in even when the restaurant was very busy"}
{"text":"One forgets some times that Cleveland is only a half-day's drive from coastal hubs such as New York and Washington DC.  When you're in certain parts of the city, the East Coast feels even closer.  Little Italy exemplifies Cleveland's unique location in the convergence zone of Midwest and Atlantic values, architecture and aesthetics; it's a dandy little place to stroll around on a casual afternoon, with abundant opportunities for culinary indulgences.   

The nicely-positioned Mia Bella, one of the many mildly kitschy Italo-American restaurants on the main strip, invites you to saunter in and grab a window table for a slow, lazy lunch.  With an ice cold Peroni or Pinot Grigio in hand, check out the view of the neighborhood's narrow, tall, tightly packed turn-of-the-century houses.  Peruse the menu of Italian-slash-Italian American classics, and try to come up with a game plan; easier said than done with Mia Bella's long list of appetizing-looking choices.  

Mia Bella's solid cuisine certainly doesn't attempt to reinvent the wheel or revolutionize the palate.  It's all been done before: bright blended marinara sauces, creamy alfredos, pounded veal cutlets, crispy calamari - all falling concretely in the happy and tasty realm of tradition and comfort. If you are a Food Network buff searching for handmade pastas or Cleveland's answer to Mario Batali, however, divert your quest elsewhere.   

I will vouch for the carbonara, which is served with a creamy and delicious egg yolk-based white sauce and crispy pancetta in a portion that is absolutely shareable.  The caesar salad, meanwhile, is light, lemony and pleasant, although beware of possibly boxed croutons.  The special antipasti plate was an unfortunate disappointment, as it is so often in US restaurants (...why do I keep ordering it, for Pete's sake?). For twelve dollars, a few meager slices of CD-sized salami, one type of soft cheese, and a handful of grapes...Silly me for having visions of spicy capicola, thin slices of folded, stacked, proscuitto, sopresatta, olives, figs and pickled delights."}
{"text":"Had a great meal at Mia Bella! We've been wanting to try this place for awhile but something always came up and we never got there.  It was worth the wait!  We started with the margarita pizza and anti pasta as an appetizer.  The pizza was great!  And while we enjoyed the taste of the anti pasta, it was a fairly small portion for the price.  Warm Italian bread was served with a tasty herb-filled butter.  For an entree, I had the baked veggie pasta.  It was delicious!  Lots of veggies and a great flavor!  Another person had the spicy tortellini.  It was spicy but not too spicy.  We had the gelato and cheesecake for dessert.  Both were worth the calories!  The server was very friendly and attentive.  We are looking forward to our next visit!"}
{"text":"I was visiting my granddaughter who's attending Case Western and she had made the reservation for dinner at Mia Bella. I'm glad that she did that as I had one of the best Italian dinners I've ever had. My standard order for comparing Italian food is the veal picatta, and Mia Bella's was the best I've had in many years. Our waiter provided excellent and courteous service. The restaurant is not large, so advance reservations are recommended. The decor with painted scenery of Italy is well done, a very pleasant establishment. If I had stayed another night in Cleveland I probably would have returned for another great Italian dinner."}
{"text":"Wow. Fantastic pasta verde.  Quite possibly the best pesto I've ever had."}
{"text":"I was here on a date. It is a good place for dates and a must try if you are in Cleveland or Little Italy. I had the Shrimp Saganaki, it was amazing. Definitely going back again and highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"This is a quaint restaurant in the center of Little Italy. It's definitely a great place for dates or just hanging out with friends. The food is all right, but a bit on the pricey side. If you're looking to order pasta, you pick a type of pasta first  ($13-19) and then add on the meats ($4-8). So you end up with a pasta that's around ~$20. However, the portion is somewhat generous.

I ordered the Mia Bella pasta ($13) with sausages (extra $4). It just tasted like your average pasta with marinara sauce, so I was not impressed at all. Don't know if I'll be coming back any time soon!"}
{"text":"Have only eaten here once but the meal was delightful. Nice mood and relaxing atmosphere , well prepared drinks and would certainly recommend for a classy Italian dinner out."}
{"text":"Menza menza, typical Italian restaurant run by non-Italians so you'll see some untraditional variations of classic dishes i.e. Raw uncooked peppers on a bed of spinach. Respectfully, Italian peppers should be fried and served with bread..Braciole should be served on a bed of pasta not roasted vegetables. This restaurant is a classy place in a charming part of town but the food falls short of expectations."}
{"text":"Had Valentines Day dinner here. The service was great. Had the Calarmari as an appetizer, it was a little on the chewy side but the taste of the sauce made up for it. We ordered the Scampi Risotto and the Chefs Favorite Pizza(basil pesto with chorizo sausage and mozzarella). It was probably the best pizza I have ever had. And the shrimp scampi's that came with the Risotto were HUGE, soo good! Love this place!!"}
{"text":"Excellent fresh Italian food. Pasta is made in-house and is to die for. Make sure you get the shrimp saganaki and mop up all the left over sauce with their bread."}
{"text":"The best Italian in Cleveland. Great service, very cozy. The food though is what really sets it apart. So so good."}
{"text":"Amazing! Service is great and so is the manager Lisa! She lent me an umbrella when it was pouring. Doesn't get any better than this place if you want great food!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went here to change it up a little bit. We usually go to another place a little closer to home but have heard good things about it. First off, my wife is second generation Italian so we have a pretty high bar. Don't let the 3 stars fool you, Mia Bella's was good.

We both had the ravioli which is our favorite Italian food. The give you a nice generous portion that will leave you feeling full when you leave. The waitress was very friendly and took her time with us, we like to go through the menu before we order and usually ask a few questions. At some places the waiter or waitress will get inpatient if you don't blurt out your order within 10 seconds of them arriving but here there was no rush. Overall, we enjoyed the atmosphere, people, and food."}
{"text":"We liked our food, and liked the outdoor seating, but we were never served bread and butter like everyone around us, and I have to think it is because we placed a small order of an entree to share. Knowing we wanted to save room for an Italian pastry next door we just split the Bolognese. Could have used more fresh herbs and some fresh grated parm on top. Friendly wait staff."}
{"text":"The BEST in Little Italy! Best food and service.  Sonny is our waiter of choice, if you go, request him.  I recommend the mussels or their version of pesto, Pasta Verde, I think.  Reasonably priced, wonderful food!  The outside seating looks like fun, but we've always been inside. Nice selection of wines, too.  You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I have always sampled Mia Bella's dish from Little Italy's festival events for two years now... So, for Mother's Day Weekend we were willing to fight the crowd and taste the food. I ordered a bottle of Champagne, but the gal that took our order did not know the difference between each bottle option. She looked young so I excused it! I am not a fan of cheesey pasta's because it seems like that dish would be for kids, but the award winning cheese tortellini really stood out to me. The review described the dish to be a little spicy!! I added chicken and was given a good size portion that was cooked perfectly and not dry at all. The pasta sauce was beyond mouthwatering and usually pasta dishes do not do that for me. I will definitely look forward to that dish again!! Last thing about the ambiance was that the bar did not match the Italian rustic them overall and the tables were crammed all together and was smaller than the photos online. It gets very very loud where you really have a hard time enjoying your conversation. I will be back on a weekday for sure when it is maybe more relaxing and less busy!!"}
{"text":"From NYC, not expecting to find good Italian food in Cleveland. I was pleasantly surprised! 

Excellent service, great portions, good wine selection. The mussels were delicious; bolognese was decent; peach prosecco gelato was stellar."}
{"text":"Service, food, and pricing make this place a fantastic value.  Best eggplant in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Unfortunately not the same now that Lisa has retired .. Her kids are clueless .. The prices are ridiculous now .. Clams $17 dollars??? The eggplant meal used to have 4 large pieces .. Now two scrawny ones ... The kids have upped the pasta and downsized the main dishes ... We won't be back and we will tell everyone it's not the same .. Second and third generations cannot run the business ... Pitiful .. Ruined a great place .. Stay away!!!


Yes my review was rough ... So here is the owners response ... Do you want to recommend this place ?   

Gery M: Thanks for your great comment !!!
A couple things u should know ..
Lisa was never an owner of my establishment, she was simply my mother-in-law and my hostess ,had absolutely nothing to do with running or operating the business for the past five and half years, which you if you were a regular you would have known this already, also thank you for telling the hostess that you're never coming back because the owner is an asshole I appreciate it very much, you and your wife never asked to speak to owner or the manager simply made a comment to the server about the eggplant Parm,there video and audio surveillance in the premisses 24/seven ..
Lisa did not cook or made the menu even when she was there so it's very clear that you ready don't have a smalls clue or what your talking about ...
I'm sorry that Lisa was not there to kiss your ass and give you free eggplant,, as far as my food and my prices go I don't need to make any comment on it facts speak for themselves..
thank you for your business in the past and I hope that you find the restaurant of your dreams in the future, that can serve you better food for better prices..

{"text":"Best Italian in Cleveland by far. My family has been going here for years. I love it. Parking is a pain and they get crowded so definitely make reservations ahead of time!"}
{"text":"This place has some of the best Italian food in the United States. The pasta is award winning for a reason."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite restaurant in little Italy. I last came with my parents for dinner. Even though it was packed when we were here, our server was very attentive! Definitely ask for the free bread and try the herb butter- I could completely fill up on this stuff without even needing to order food- it's so good! We ended up ordering some oysters and the calamari as an appetizer. The oysters were so-so, and they had some sand in them, but to be fair this isn't a seafood restaurant. The calamari, on the other hand, was awesome! It's not fried. It's cooked in a broth with a little bit of a kick to it! For our entrees, we got the spaghetti bolognese, the chicken kabobs, the tortellini, and the veal ravioli. Everything was fantastic as usual! My favorites on the menu are the tortellini and there baked veggies. Overall, I love this place and there's a reason I keep on coming back!"}
{"text":"BEST ITALIAN JOINT!

We had a wonderful dinner in this legendary restaurant in Cleveland's Little Italy. We started with the evening's special appetizer of Crab Crostini and they were delicious. For the entree I had the Frutti di Mare Piccanti (excellent) and my wife had the special Middle Neck Clams with Linguini (also excellent).

No room for dessert!

Five stars all around."}
{"text":"I came here based on the high number of positive reviews and it was everything I had hoped for and more. The staff was extremely friendly, the food came out very promptly and the menu offered a very good number of healthy options for an Italian place. I ordered the Caesar salad and lamb chops. Although I wasn't asked how I would like them cooked, they came out exactly as I would have liked them. They were tender, flavorful, and juicy. Not fatty at all. The accompanying sauce was perfect and there was an abundance of very nicely grilled veggies. If I lived in town I would be a regular."}
{"text":"I came here with my Mom while we were visiting Case Western's campus since it had been recommended to us by the hotel staff. The place was full of people so we immediately felt like we were in good hands! We both ordered the Cheese Tortellini since the menu said it was a \"Taste of Little Italy Award Winner.\" I really did enjoy it because the sauce had a zing to it. My Mom however, cannot handle any spicy foods and wished it would have said it was slightly spicy on the menu. (Although nothing went to waste since I finished up her leftovers!) 

I also immediately enjoy a Caesar Salad much more if it comes with anchovies, which this one did! 

It is a good thing we walked to the restaurant though since we would not have been able to park anywhere within a mile radius if we hadn't. But parking seems to be an issue with most places in Little Italy."}
{"text":"Great little spot in the heart of Little Italy. The atmosphere is nice , the service is good and the menu looks amazing. To start we ordered their house salad. It was unetable because the lettuce was brown in spots, limp and wilted. Next was their  clams special. It was outstanding! The clams were cooked perfectly and we loved the pairing with the zucchini and tomatos. We also ordered the Lobster Ravioli. Perfection! The pasta was perfectly done and eldente and it was jam packed with lobster. To finish we tried the chefs favorite pizza (pesto, chorizo, onions, peppers and smoked mozz). The pizza was great, loved the spicy chorizo and pesto, my only complaint was the peppers were cut way to large for me when I took a bite the pepper dragged all the toppings with it. Over all great experience and great food."}
{"text":"If I could give this place more than 5 stars I would. Had one of the best waitresses in my entire life. Started off with the Shrimp Saganaki. I would come back JUST for that appetizer alone. The cheese on it is like nothin I've ever tasted. The fettuccine carbonara is absolutely insane. Super creamy, bold flavors, the chicken was cooked to perfection. Then to top It off we finished with the Cannolis (Filled to order) and the Salted Carmel Soufflé (TO DIE FOR.) This is a Little Italy MUST."}
{"text":"Came here on a rainy Friday evening based on the Yelp reviews. 

Wonderful service. Great list of well prepared, aps, entrees and deserts to choose from. Several tasty specials offered. 

Make a reservation. I called about 4:00 pm for a reservation that evening and they could only squeeze us in at 9:00. There is valet for cars (shared with all local place on Mayfield Rd.) that can be used. There is little or no other parking to be found. 

We spent some time next door in the wine bar while we waited for our table to be ready. There isn't a large bar here to hang out while you wait. They seat diners at their bar. 

When our very professional waiter asked if we wanted to see desert menus, my dining companion said, \"No, we are full.\" I said bring it, \"looking is free.\"

He then proceeded to describe the specials. \"Warm molten chocolate brownie topped with ice cream and salted Carmel\" got an involuntary groan of pleasure from my companion and so was ordered. Wonderful!  Save room. It was worth it."}
{"text":"Our go to place every time we visit Cleveland.  Haven't had a bad meal yet.  They are accommodating with gluten issues, the service is great and the dishes are always served quickly yet the meal never seems rushed.  Have been there also with a large parties.  I love this place in little Italy."}
{"text":"By far the best Italian restaurant my husband and I have ever been to in Cleveland!

1. Drinks - Awesome!
2. Food - Beyond amazing! 
3. Desserts -  To die for!

Its a classy fun place!"}
{"text":"This is hands down my favorite Italian restaurant!  The food is completely authentic, right out of Italy.  The atmosphere is busy but quaint and they make you feel like family.  The waiter was well versed in the menu and made excellent recommendations.  The wine menu will not disappoint.  The portions are not for the faint of heart so go with a full appetite. The tortellini is outstanding and thoroughly delicious.  You cannot go wrong with this Italian eatery so just go  and take in the experience.  I will be back!"}
{"text":"Amazing!!!! So delicious .. you have to try the tortellini. Atmosphere was great and our waiter was great! We even got to try the new dessert at no cost since we waited a bit for our meal (and possibly because it was my husband's birthday ) Definitely will be returning!"}
{"text":"My wife, adult daughter, her two children and I had a wonderful dinner at Mia Bella over the recent holiday season. The restaurant is on the small size and we were glad we had an early (5pm) reservation as it filled quickly. The service was attentive and friendly. Our server Amanda impressed me by offering to discuss with the bartender the details of a specific wine which she was not familiar with. What you get at Mia Bella is a refined version of an American Italian Trattoria. The portions are large and have great flavors. My wife and I shared the Buffalo Mozzarella salad. It was delicious. For main course, I had the Frutti di Mare. It was a very large portion loaded with clams, mussels, shrimp and squid. The sauce was a light, flavorful not too spicy tomato sauce, just right to accompany the linguine and sea food. 
My wife had the Pasta Bolognese. It was a generous portion with a rich, meaty, moderately spicy buttery sauce  which was richly satisfying. 
My daughter had the shrimp saganaki pasta  which she raved about as delicious, flavorful and again very large appetizer portion. My teen age grandson had the lobster ravioli. He devoured it very quickly along with 6 pieces of warm Italian bread.
My college age vegetarian grand daughter had the meatless Mia Bella pasta. Good to know vegetarians can get a good meal there.
Our meals were topped off by sharing two servings of a very rich and delicious Tiramisu. If you want a delicious, filling Italian meal in Cleveland I highly recommend Mi Bella."}
{"text":"For a high end Italian restaurant, I expected more. The pizza was a little undercooked, and the cheese never stayed on. It would always slip off which made it difficult to eat. I also tried the pasta verde and expected a nice creamy pasta, but was instead given a chunky one. The steak was standard, but the roast vegetables were the best part. Overall, the food was decent, but definitely not worth the price. The service however was quite good with staff that were very accommodating. A good place for an expensive family reunion or celebration, but not a standard dinner."}
{"text":"This place fills up fast, but boy, do they have delicious meals!! Their pan seared calamari is a must, and their fettuccini carbonara is great. My boyfriend got a spicy cheese pasta which was also wonderful. Our lunch was almost $80, but totally worth every dollar. Service was friendly and knowledgeable and just can't beat their fresh pastas."}
{"text":"I come to this place at least a couple times every time that I'm home and am never disappointed. Last night I was there with two friends for a friend date. When we arrived at 8PM we got a table outside which I must add is part of the reason this place doesn't get a 5 star from me--the \"patio\" is practically non existent and there is very little space to move. I may love al fresco dining in the summer months, but it kind of kills the mood if you are constantly being shoved by the person behind you when they move their chair. 

Other than the space issue the ambiance is great. There is always ample people watching. Our waiter, who's name I unfortunately don't remember was great, very attentive and patient without constant gabbing and indecisiveness. He was also ready with recommendations when we needed them. 

I got the Frutti di Mare Piccanti, one of my friends got the Risotto with Scampi, and the other got the mussels.

I decided to get this because usually when I come here I end up getting a ton of appetizers and never actually get to the entrees. This was what I chose, at the suggestion of the waiter, and I was now disappointed. There was a generous amount of FRESH seafood, yummy mussels, calamari, and shrimp over a heap of perfectly cooked linguine. The sauce was delicious, it wasn't quite as spicy as I was hoping, but it was delicious none the less. I had a dish similar to this when I was in Italy and it was almost as good, hence the 4 stars. Regardless it was delicious and tasted just as good when I ate the left overs the next day.

Both of my friends loved their dishes and we went home full and happy.

The only downside was that there were people setting off fireworks near by the restaurant, certainly nothing they could have done but it definitely tainted the experience. All in all it was a great dining experience and I will certainly be back."}
{"text":"Of the restaurants clustered at this busy Little Italy intersection, Mia Bella is on the smaller side with only one dining room. To be sure though, it's charming and feels a touch more elegant. The crisp red cloth napkins and tall wine glasses are more appropriate for anniversaries, birthdays, and parents-in-town. But it's not so stiff-necked that you wouldn't feel comfortable in jeans (which pretty much everyone in our group was wearing). 

We brought a group of about 9 to celebrate a birthday. For starters, we had some slices of warm, rustic bread and herb butter (complimentary) and a seasonal Crab Bruschetta. Both gobbled up immediately, since that butter has flavor and isn't shy about it. The crab was mixed in with a whole lot of mayo and other creamy indistinguishable stuff - good, but I could always do with more actual seafood in my meal. 

Our paths diverged afterwards, and having eaten a light dinner already, I got the Prince Edward Mussels on the appetizer menu. It seemed a little pricey at first, but when the bowl arrived, it was a pretty hefty little hill of shellfish bathing in a tomato and herb broth, some steamed greens scattered here and there. Definitely a good choice - ask for some more bread to dip into the broth and you'll leave sated. The pizza is another economical choice (at only $9.95 for a personal pizza), but the other plates my friends ordered showed that Mia Bella doesn't skimp on portion size. The birthday boy was provided a Tiramisu Mousse with a candle in a champagne flute, which he happily devoured alone. 

The wait staff reflected the elegant casualness of the rest of the restaurant. They were dressed in uniform, but conversed naturally and made sure to check in on us every so often, refilling water glasses and the like. There's a fair libation menu to match the solid foods, and our waitress came back at just the right times to ask if people wanted second rounds (alcohol refills not free, of course). 

I'm glad I finally got to check out Mia Bella after having passed by so many times! While I still haven't found a Little Italy restaurant that seizes my heart, this place is a solid and reliable choice for a nice but low-key dinner with family, friends, or dates."}
{"text":"This place continues to amaze me! Everything I've tried has been prepared beautifully. I haven't tried everything on the menu yet, but I am willing to come back and continue to discover. 

Service has been great as well! Even though they weren't able to accommodate us for a seating request we made when we made the reservation, but hey, life goes on. I'm willing to look pass it.

What was also impressive to me was that every server seems to have a genuine passion for the food they serve, and I think they have very good reasons to. 

I love the fact that they can serve family style. It brings so much warmth to this place. We sure will come back!"}
{"text":"The best gluten-free Italian food in the Cleveland area!"}
{"text":"Out of the handful of Little Italy spots I have tried, this is now my favorite. The reviews about the award winning 3 Cheese Tortellini are no joke-- that is what I ordered and it is no surprise why it is Mia Bella's most beloved dish. I can't wait to order it again. Our table had a hard time not filling up on the bread, as it was the best bread at a restaurant we had ever tasted. James was our server and he was also one of the bests ever. He was on it like flies on you know what and even noticed that I had slopped on my shirt (I couldn't help but to shovel the tortellini in my mouth like a barbarian) and came over to ask if I would like some soda water and a fresh linen. I mean talk about A+++ service. All around just an amazing dining experience."}
{"text":"Friendly and attentive Service. Pasta dishes and fish excellent. Extensive wines by the glass. Very fresh Local ingredients. Entree presentation exceptional."}
{"text":"\"There are several, genuinely-great Italian restaurants in Cleveland's Little Italy,\" my host explained, \"but Mia Bella is my favorite.\"  Lead on!

After the shrimp saganaki was delivered to our table and I took my first bite of the perfectly cooked shellfish, dripping with a creamy, but slightly spicy tomato sauce, I found myself believing him.  Do yourself a favor, get the saganaki, skip the butter and use the crispy-on-the-outside-but-soft-on-the-inside bread to sop up some of that amazing sauce.  Absolutely delicious!  Wash it down with a nice Chianti and you'll thank me.  You probably won't remember me, but I'll feel a little warmness in my heart as you smile, nod your head and go \"mmm hmm\".  

My entrée was good, but not mind-blowing.  The grilled sea scallops over butternut squash with other veggies satisfied, but I won't be talking about it after this.  

Service was impeccable!  Excellent suggestions, prompt and polite service.  

I don't have any experiences with Little Italy's other spots, but Mia Bella is definitely worth a visit!"}
{"text":"In Cleveland quite simply an amazing place. This restaurant is in Little Italy and has plenty of competition, but I can't believe there is anything better in the area. My server Lily really made my visit special. She recommended a veal dish that was like no other it was rolled in proccutto with ricotta cheese and topped with delicious marinara sauce. What a great choice! Bottom line the Yelpers are spot on. I travel a lot and this will be on my favorite Italian place when in Cleveland. Don't miss this place. Enjoy"}
{"text":"Why can't this be located in Baltimore???
I seriously want to come visit my aunt out here more often just because of this place- don't tell my aunt!
Located in Little Italy, this small restaurant really takes me back to Italy. It has a Mediterranean essence, even down to the mandolin playing on the soundtrack.
Our waitress was so friendly and was comfortable enough to start cracking jokes with us by the end of lunch. She and the kitchen were also speedy in bringing out our food. Oh the food.
Appetizers: Real Buffalo Mozzarella, Roasted Peppers, Tomatoes, and Prosciutto. I really shouldn't need to elaborate.
Also, Fantastic Eggplant Parm.
Entree: Cheese Tortellini in a tomato cream sauce with Peas and Prosciutto. Excellent.
Dessert: The best Tiramisu I've had since Italy. Also, Chocolate Covered Chocolate Gelato. And Chocolate Caramel Souffle topped with French Vanilla Gelato.
(No, I did not eat all of these myself!)
Seriously, if you're ever in Cleveland, go here."}
{"text":"I can't even say enough nice things about this place. Quaint outdoor seating in comfortable chairs. Super friendly staff that is very knowledgeable. Shrimp appetizer my friends ordered, they kept all meal to lick the sauce. I had the Margherita pizza w pepperoni added.   Delicious. Perfect fresh cheese. Wine was perfect. Pasta rated \"the best\" from my friends. You have to try this!"}
{"text":"Their sea shrimps and scallops were good and also seasoned well. Also the server was kind too. But the sauce on the scallops was just alright."}
{"text":"My father and I got into Cleveland a day early for the Browns game and found a great place to eat at called Mia Bella. The service was excellent. We always had food being brought to us, our drinks were never empty, and the menu incite from our server was very helpful. I tried the Veal Braciole and thought it was pretty good. My father ordered the Mia Bella Especiale and he absolutely loved it. For desert, we had the Salted Caramel desert and the Raspberry desert. Both were excellent. The venue was charming and we thoroughly enjoyed our experience."}
{"text":"I was excited to take my mom for a nice dinner after reading and hearing excellent reviews. Food was excellent--we ordered the shrimp saganaki appetizer which reminded me of a tasty italian take on chicken tikka masala but with shrimp. I had the daily special: grilled swordfish and mushroom and spinach risotto with grilled asparagus and a mango crudo on the side. My mom had the scallops with an assortment of vegetables. Presentation and taste of food was great. Our server was welcoming, polite, and attentive.

Despite the delicious food I was left with a slightly bitter taste in my mouth with the host on 10/8/2017. He was a 30-40 year old, heavier set, bald, and slightly disheveled. After waiting patiently 45 mins to be seated at an outside table. We were being led back to a table by his assistant and had just taken our seats when he hollered to his assistant to seat us at a different table. We went back to the front of the restaurant while a different table was being prepared. We were then taken by the assistant to a much further table--the only one without a canopy over the top that was on two different levels of cement making the table very wobbly and with the setting 5:30pm sun blaring directly into my face for the whole meal--(only two tables of the many outdoor tables have this setting sun exposure, and clearly this was the worst table they have at the restaurant).

I felt that we were treated rudely and disrespectfully and I wondered at the time whether it was because we were dressed more casually as we had a very nice long walk planned or worse whether it had anything to do with race. Though we both enjoyed the meal it is unfortunate that the experience was tainted by the unprofessional host."}
{"text":"Hotel recommend I try this place, so I took a shuttle over. Despite advertising they are open til 9 they stop seating at 8 and I was rudely turned away, like I should have somehow known better as a tourist. No I am stuck here waiting for the shuttle and hungry."}
{"text":"Absolutely phenomenal food.  Tried Mia Bella out for the 1st time this Valentine's Day.  By far the best Italian food we've ever had.  And that is saying something, since my husband and his whole mom's side of the family are Italian.  It becomes instantly apparent from the first bite that all of their ingredients are fresh.  The food is very flavorful without being heavy.  We had the calamari for an appetizer and we both had a pasta dish for our entree.  We definitely want to come back to try some of the other dishes.  The interior is very pretty, clean, and cozy.  The service was excellent and attentive.  The only thing somewhat critical I will say (but won't take any stars away from b/c I know it's super nit picky) is that based on how the door is situated, with just 1 door leading to the outside beside the dining room (and without a foyer area or 2nd outside doorway), whenever someone opens the door during the winter time the cold air whips right through the dining room where you're eating.  We were originally placed next to the door, and my husband had to ask them if we could move.  That was the first time we've ever had to do that.  Again, it's nit-picky, but just something to be aware of in the winter.  Just try to avoid sitting right by the entrance.  But otherwise, incredible, authentic Italian foot at a relatively reasonable price."}
{"text":"Awesome dinner.  Waiter was very helpful when it came to food and wine suggestions.  Try the calamari!"}
{"text":"Went tonight for my birthday. Excellent food and service. Veal picatta and beet salad and bread fantastic. Very crowded but we weren't rushed. A real gem in Little Italy."}
{"text":"Great decor and outdoor seating! Excellent margherita pizza. Everything I saw come out of the kitchen reminded me of Tuscany. Authenticity that you would expect in Little Italy. 5 stars!!"}
{"text":"Food was really good and the service was as well, however, this establishment tried to charge us $15 for bringing in our OWN cake for my friends birthday. I have NEVER had this problem before. I work at a restaurant and customers bring in their own birthday cakes all the time (it's not a big deal if they all have dinner, right?). We all had dinner and some of us had drinks. You'd think that they would have been nicer because of all the money we spent here. We spent over $150 all together, and that was without the tip. I just couldn't believe that they were trying to charge us $15 for bringing in a birthday cake.. they ruined all the fun that comes from celebrating birthdays.
P.s. Is this establishment aware that they play Spanish music? Or do they think Spanish and Italian are both the same language?"}
{"text":"The location of Mia Bella is great. It's in the heart of Little Italy, on a corner street, you get wonderful lighting at dinner time in the spring. The food was alright. It's not even the most expensive place in Little Italy but I just didn't think it was all that. I'm glad I came once, I wouldn't go again."}
{"text":"Went on recommendation and everything was absolutely phenomenal. The calamari was delicious though I honestly would have liked it a little more spicy. I got the tortellini with sausage and it was mouth watering. My boyfriend thoroughly enjoyed his Mia bella pasta with meatballs and chicken. I would have eaten 15 of the salted caramel chocolate soufflé. The environment was busy but everyone was very attentive and friendly. I wish I remembered our servers name because he took great care of us. I would definitely come again."}
{"text":"Great restaurant in Little Italy. Service was good, the valet parking was annoying, but that's everywhere in LI. My girlfriend and I got the same food, the crab meat on ciabatta bread as an appetizer, it was great. We also both ordered the Lobster Ravioli, which was also amazing. I got a Mia Bella salad which was okay, but nothing special. I also got the Great Gatsby drink which was also just okay, but the crab appetizer and the lobster ravioli alone make this a 5 Star. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"An excellent restaurant with premier service. Their red sauce is worthy of comment. Meatballs from veal-pork-beef -great addition to a meal. 
Wines are reasonable as are the drinks. In Cleveland a great choice."}
{"text":"Ok food...very overpriced for what it is. They won't bring you bread and butter unless you ask for it."}
{"text":"Mia Bella is a very cute, intimate dining establishment. The employees are very friendly. Today my review is just about their pizza. We ordered one of their 9\" pizzas and were totally let down.
We ordered it to-go, at lunch -- and we work right across the street so the pizza was picked up right away and was still hot. Sadly, they placed it in a styrofoam container. All the condensation formed and dripped onto the pizza and made it soggy. Mia Bella needs to invest in some nice, small cardboard pizza boxes. I had to revive our pizza by reheating it in a 350º oven for a few minutes
The toppings were very tasty!
The crust... well, the crust was reminiscent of the Pizza Hut Personal Pan Pizza of the mid-1980s. My husband said it reminded him of toast crusts.  It also reminded me of Pillsbury's refrigerated pizza dough crust -- or their crescent rolls.
Kind of a letdown for the price.  
We'll return to Mia Bella another time and try something other than pizza.
It's still Mama Santa's for the best pizza in Little Italy!"}
{"text":"Mia Bella is by far the best Italian food I've ever had, AND THEY ARE GLUTEN FREE!!! You can get pasta, pizza, and bread that are gluten free. Amazing calamari appetizer sautéed in marinara with zucchini and onions, delicious pizza choices, the salads are on point, and the pasta will make you want to dance!! It can be very crowded and you definitely need a reservation as there are always lines to get in, but it is more than worth it!! Use the valet parking, you won't find parking any other way."}
{"text":"We called in for reservations the same day on a Saturday, promptly arrived and got seated immediately. Our server was very polite, attentive and knowledgeable of the items on the menu. The food came out quick and was served hot.

My highlight of the night was the Mia Bella Martini. With the inclusion of raspberries and blueberries it was nicely sweet, mellow and chilled almost at a temp right before freezing. Oh. My. God. After the first sip, my mood seemed to elevate, who needs Prozac?

Shrimp Saganaki was another wonderful treat. It had plump, juicy shrimp swimming in this creamy sauce that afterward, we all dipped the bread in, couldn't help it sorry. I almost wanted to lick it off the plate.

The group walked around the block to end the almost beautiful (ruined by the plate-licking) evening on a high note. Little Italy looked beautiful, alive and festive on that cool crisp fall night."}
{"text":"I've heard so many good things about Mia Bella, I had to try to myself and it was a fantastic decision! I ordered their famous spicy tortellini as my main meal. The dish was just the perfect amount of spice and I can see why they are well known for it! It's nothing like I ever had before. For dessert, I got the pistachio gelato and that was a great choice as well! There's nothing more refreshing than gelato on a nice Cleveland day! It reminded me so much of the countless pistachio gelato I had when I traveled abroad in Italy. I would say Mia Bella's gelato is pretty authentic! Good atmosphere, great food, and how can I forget about the service? Our server was very accommodating and knew when to check on us. Great dinner spot! 

Tip: If it's nice out, request to sit outside to enjoy your meal and the hustle and bustle of Little Italy!"}
{"text":"Went with my family, including my one year old, and our server, Megan, was very accommodating. We had a nice table by the window where my daughter could occupy herself looking outside. Had the arugula and prosciutto wrapped pear salad with goat cheese (delicious), shrimp saganaki with linguini and a nice Chianti. The food was so so good! Slightly spicy with a delicious cheese and fresh tasting shrimp (and I'm picky about shrimp). Their bread and herbed butter was very good, also, and my sister and her husband really enjoyed their seafood pasta dishes. Finished off with tiramisu (wasn't a big fan of this- a bit watery- but then I'm not a big tiramisu fan in general) and salted caramel gelato, which was delicious. Would definitely return!"}
{"text":"Took my wife here for her birthday dinner. Even though it was a Tuesday night it was busy. Service started off very slow because our server was busy and didn't have enough time for us. He took our drink order and we didn't get it for at least 20 minutes another server had to retake our order. He did come over and apologize and recommended some great pastas off the menu and even how we should order them. When we finally got our food Wow it was amazing. The shrimp saginaki was outstanding as was the eggplant. Highly recommend the shrimp saginaki. I got the pasta with tomato cream sauce and added chorizo. It was very delicious. My wife ordered the fruiiti di marre she couldn't stop raving about it. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in Little Italy! Italian fare with a Mediterranean twist. I bring most of my family and out of town guests here and they all leave happy. As noted by other reviewers, the Cheesy Tortellini is a star. Try it with sausage if you want protein. If you're a fan of pork belly, their appetizer is a tasty generous portion and is paired nicely with fruit and greens. The unbreaded Calamari, Egg Plant, and Shrimp Saganaki appetizer are also winners. Service is first-rate and timely."}
{"text":"This is my absolute FAVORITE restaurant. My husband and I eat here for every Valentine's Day, birthdays, etc. I always worry when we go that it won't be as fantastic as the last time, but it ALWAYS IS! The service is good, and the food is delicious. The soda is always tasty and and sweet. We always start with the Margarita pizza as an appetizer, and it is delicious! We also love the warm break they bring to the table. For an entree, I generally get the tortellini, and it's always right on. The only thing is sometimes the seats are too close together, and it can be uncomfortable, but we go anyway! We recommend this place to anyone who asks where he or she should go in Cleveland!"}
{"text":"Friday night and friends wanted to eat dinner in Little Italy.  Thought it would be a perfect time to try Mia Bella as I hadn't since they opened.  
First impressions are good.  It's a cute place with fake fresco's on the wall.  Very clean, and busy (which would have been a deal breaker if it wasn't on Friday night)  
The staff was very friendly though not very open to giving the daily specials without being asked for them.  
I settled on the Albanian salad and lamb chop entree.  My wife had the Ma hi Fish (not so) special and the same salad.
The salad was good.  Cool, crisp, fresh greens , cucumber and tomato in a nice vinaigrette though the aged Feta cheese was the star of the salad.
The entrees on the other hand...
Wife's Ma hi came out grossly over cooked on a bed of equally overcooked and under-seasoned spinach.  She hardly touched it, and when the waiter cleared the plates there were no questions toward her untouched plate. 
My lamb came out like a sloppy mess.  The chops were good, cooked rare to my liking and seasoned well.  Though they sit on what must have been 3 pounds of Polenta and were covered with tomato sauce.  The polenta had broken already and the sauce was good, spiced well and fresh. There was much too much going on on this plate.  I didn't notice if it took more that one waiter to bring it out.
Dinner came to $117 with drinks and gratuity.  For the money there are much better options in Little Italy.  This may be a place to stop for a light meal (I saw pizza's on the menu) and a glass of wine."}
{"text":"Mmmmm carbs. Our \"lets eat someplace in Little Italy\" turn into us going to Mia Bella based on its great reviews. Parking in Little Italy sucks, but they do have valet. I would definitely suggest making a reservation. We made one for our larger group and were seated right away and the restaurant was about half full at 630 on a weekday. By 7 it was totally full. Good service (they even fill your water glass as you're about to take a sip). Our waitress was knowledgeable about the daily specials and convinced us on the special appetizer and wine. 

The food did take probably a little over 30min to come out, but it was piping hot and delicious! I got the cheese tortellini. I added sausage, but that was totally not necessary since it already came with porchetta (poor ordering on my part). Portion sizes are large enough to have some leftovers, but I definitely could have eaten it all. 

Overall, I would definitely come back for my pasta fix. But maybe for lunch next time because dinner got a little pricy."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. Mia Bella sticks out from other little Italy restaurants because it offers more than just pizza and pasta. Their spicy couscous is amazing! Don't forget to ask for bread- it's free, but they don't put it out unless you ask"}
{"text":"I still really love this place. What I love mostly is the consistency! My boyfriend and I went in yesterday with a reservation and were seating around 20 minutes after our reservation. We got seated by the door with lots of foot traffic which isn't fun when it's cold out. 

The food: 
My boyfriend got the tortellini with sausage as he always gets and it's just as delicious, creamy, and flavorful as the first time! 

I got the Albanian salad and special salmon & risotto dish. The salad was delicious, awesome fresh flavors. The salmon was cooked perfectly but the risotto and the mango relish and the sauce around the dish were all sweet. There were also whole large veggies such as whole carrots and large asparagus. There was a lot going on in the dish and I would say it could've been better if there were less ingredients. 

Can't go wrong with getting anything on the menu here... the consistency is awesome!"}
{"text":"First timer! had dinner with friends 
Smelled awesome as you walked through the doors but... No host stand ? Waited 10min at the Bar? of all places till somebody asked us what we were doing there??? Really? Lol 
So reservations were at 6:30pm for 4 people and the table wasn't even ready for us wow! 
Finally we were seated @6:45 fifteen minutes after our original reservation unacceptable ! But sat down got our drink orders in appetizers ordered . Only saving grace was our server Candy! Wonderful server accommodated us was warm very knowledgeable.
Got our drinks! The mussels were delicious! The cheese and meat assortment was delicious as well. 
Main entrees looked great but was a little under seasoned and the pasta was over cooked. My grilled chicken was dry and looked like it was pressed grilled not char grilled. So overall ok place not so much the hype people make Mia Bella to be."}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants in Little Italy - the best part is the fact that they are at a street corner, and if you're there during the summer, there's no other place you'd want to dine at. Everything is fantastic, especially their eggplant parmesan. The staff are amazingly friendly, and go out of their way to make sure everything is fine and above their high standards."}
{"text":"I was visiting Cleveland for business meetings and had a few free hours in the afternoon.  I went to the Rock and Roll hall of fame and a friend recommended checking out Little Italy.  I did, and chose Mia Bella for dinner.  

I started with an arugula salad with prosciutto and persimmons.  That was an interesting enough combination to get my attention and it was tasty.  One of the signature dishes at Mia Bella is the tortellini in spicy cream sauce.  I figured, \"when in Rome\" and wasn't disappointed.  The sauce wasn't too spicy and I can see why this is a crowd pleaser.  They have lots of wines by the glass, and a good selection overall.  I sat at the bar and had friendly, attentive service the whole time.

Mia Bella and Little Italy are worth a visit."}
{"text":"Mia Bella is more than meets the eye. When we first arrived, we immediately took a liking to the ambiance. It reminded me of some restaurants in the Italian neighborhood in Boston, but less pretentious. 

We ordered the House Smoked Pork Belly and a Black Truffle Burrata. Wow. The pork belly, was especially divine. Next we shared the Sausage Pappardelle. Again, finger licking good flavors. All this was accompanied by a bottle of Knucklehead Zin. 

Service was friendly and efficient.

Cuisine: 5 stars
Ambiance: 4 stars
Service: 4 stars"}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here for our anniversary when we were staying at Washington Place Inn.  Wow!  We love the food and the service.  The spicy cheese tortellini was amazing!  Not surprised it won the Taste of Little Italy award!  I have craved it since!  My husband had a shrimp scampi dish and loved that as well.  We were given a great wine recommendation and the service at the bar was fantastic!  We will definitely eat here again and have recommended it to friends and family!"}
{"text":"The restaurant interior is small and gets loud on a busy night. There is outdoor seating, however. The food took a while to come out, but service was friendly. Penne with prosciutto was good, and the calamari excellent. Not sure if it's worth the price, but overall this place is not bad. If I could, I'd give it 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"I've had their lobster ravioli and frutti di mare piccanti and definitely liked the frutti di mare piccanti more. For $26, it's not the cheapest but it is a big serving and comes with a lot of seafood. Would recommend this place if you're in Little Italy or Cleveland Heights!"}
{"text":"Salad was good. Calamari & veal piccata could have been better. Nice size portions though. Service wasn't that good. She had to walk past us every time she went to other tables. We were kind of ignored. Waited like 20 min for our entrees & she just let us sit there. They offer some good fresh bread, but she didn't.  I asked her for some right before our entrees. Decor is simple but nice."}
{"text":"We LOVED our dinner here. We came at 4:50PM and the outside was already full, so be warned - this place gets busy! We didn't have a reservation and the server told us it was good that we came when we did - so good warning for any other folks looking for a quick delicious bite in Little Italy. 4:30-5 may be your golden hour...We had the buffalo mozzarella appetizer, and shared two dishes - the cheese tortellini and the scallops with grilled veggies (including butternut squash - yum!). We also had a bottle of the house Pinot Grigio and the salted caramel lava cake for dessert. Everything was superb. Our server Mary was WONDERFUL. She had good recommendations and checked on us every 10 minutes or so. We felt really well taken care of. The place was busy but not overly loud. Beautiful interior with tall ceilings. I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a date night or a nice dinner out with family. Based on how busy they were, I would say if you have a larger group make sure to make a reservation. I loved it. Will be coming back with other family members."}
{"text":"From a service and atmosphere perspective, this restaurant provides a great experience in Little Italy; however, the food didn't match the accompanying expectations."}
{"text":"This restaurant was ok and the bread was good. However, it was not the best Italian food I have found and seems overrated. Furthermore, the menu options are slim, they do not even offer salads as an entree."}
{"text":"This is going to be my favorite Italian restaurant now...I am a vegetarian and they have many vegetarian options, they are ready to customize the dishes to make them vegetarian. 
Food-- very tasty appetizers, lot of options including vegetarians. Desert we tried was raspberry gelato cheese cake and I never have such a beautiful and tasty it was out of the world if you like ice cream cake.
Ambience -- nice and cozy ambience. A typical restaurant in the corner style.
Services- very nice and pleasant people in the restaurant.
Drink- best martini ever.
I would love to go there again to taste more from their menu."}
{"text":"This is such a cute little restaurant in Little Italy, Cleveland. Love the outdoor seating-- great for people watching and conversations.  We ordered their award winning Cheese Tortellini and Mia Bella pasta with a side of meatballs. Cheese tortellini was delicious with the kick of spiciness that's perfect to taste, not overwhelming. Mia bella was good but would've loved it with spinach and more basil."}
{"text":"Mia Bella is seriously one of my absolute favorite places to go to. I ended up finding this place two years ago, after searching on yelp for a good Italian place went and checked it out and fell in love, fast forward two years later, and my family was looking for a place to go to for lunch that was somewhat close to the Cleveland Clinic. Mia Bella instantly came to my mind. We went on a sunday, around 3, without a reservation and were seated upon arrival. My parents loved the decor, ambiance, and the acoustics are just great. It's a great place to go to enjoy each others company, and indulge in some amazing food.

Speaking of food. Dang this place just does everything right. My brother started off with the Zuppa Di Pesce, and we were amazed at all the seafood that was in it. We started off with the Eggplant Parmesan, and wow! It was like none I have ever had before. Eggplant Parmesan is one of my family's favorite Italian dishes, and we all agreed that this was the best we've ever had. The Eggplant was done just right, nice and crisp. And the cheese they added that extra oooomph to it. 

I could go into great detail about all the food, and how much we enjoyed it. But honestly I'll just spare you. To sum it up though, we loved literally everything. The pasta dishes are just delicious. And just seem like actual genuine Italian dishes like you would get in Italy. 

Tip for you though: Don't skip dessert! Especially if you are a Tiramisu lover. We had the Tiramisu, Sea Salt Carmel Gelato, and Pistachio Gelato. Could not pick a favorite, everything in this place, exceeds expectations and has so much flavor."}
{"text":"Their appetizers should be called teasers. Went there because of their Gluten Free menu. Couldn't tell their pasta was. Absolutely delicious."}
{"text":"We came here on a Sunday afternoon in the spring, looking for a place to eat lunch before we took my mom the art museum for her birthday. Funny enough, it's not always easy to find a place open for lunch on a Sunday around here.

I was pleasantly surprised when I searched the Yelp app for businesses open for lunch and found Mia Bella first on that list. I had heard so many positive things about the restaurant from Yelpers and it seemed to have become the new favorite in Little Italy. 

We were sat outside and served some warm bread immediately. When the waitress came out, she told us they were actually slammed inside and short-staffed for the afternoon. She told us she was going to do her best to make sure we didn't notice this, but wanted to warn us just in case. I appreciated the info! She set realistic expectations right off the bat, and did a great job of serving our party of 6 in a timely manner. 

The food was delicious. The must-have on the menu seemed to be their tortellini dish with a blush sauce and I was in no position to say \"no\" to that kind of dish. I also ordered a side salad, which was light, simple and featured fresh mozzarella cheese. The tortellini dish was quite delicious and served up a little kick on the side, which I loved. It wasn't the best version of this dish that I've ever had, but it is definitely the best rendition I've had in Cleveland. 

I didn't pay the bill, but the lunch prices and portions seemed just fine to me. The service and food was great--I'd say Mia Bella sets a great standard in Little Italy for Italian fare."}
{"text":"Food is usually pretty good (nothing special) with fresh and healthier choices offered. We have often come here over the years whenever traveling to Cleveland Clinic.  They had always been kind attentive and good service.   Parking is always a nightmare with luck and circling the block several times often necessary.  After coping with the parking, the past several times we came we were very disappointed.  From cold soup to poor service (forgetting items, serving my husband's entree while mine was served 15 mins later or bringing soup, salad and entree all at the same time) things are not the same.  Twice now we were turned away by indifferent hostesses (which stood there and ignored us) saying there were no tables available and offered us a 2 hour wait.  Both of these time there were at least 1/2 of the tables in the restaurant vacant and no customers waiting.  Apparently they do not need the business or simply don't care.  Leave the restaurant and walk 20 feet in any direction and find similar food with more accommodating and friendlier staff.  Dined across the street tonight and when we came back for the car (at the two hour wait time originally offered to get a table) and the restaurant was still 1/2 empty.  Such a shame."}
{"text":"Pasta was perfect al dente. I had the frutti di mare and it was well prepared. My wife had the verde pasta this was really good. I recommend asking for al dente when ordering your pasta plates. My boys had the ribeye and it was cook very well. The owner was very friendly and open to conversation. We ended the meal with espressos and cannoli. It was a good intro to Cleveland's little Italy for my family."}
{"text":"Review from Labor Day weekend visit: Had the well-spiced and flavorful 
Cheese Tortellini with tangy tomato cream sauce. My Man-Companion had the Linguini Bianco with cream sauce. What (he would let me!) try of it was rich and balanced with white pepper. The servers were generous with the nutty parmesan-reggiano. Adding a side of homemade meatballs for the table allowed us to sample their popular marinara, it was thick with hints of basil and garlic, everything Italian red gravy should be. Did I mention the bread? So good! Missing Mia Bella now - planning to hit this place every time we head to the Cleve. 

People were queued up at the bakery next door, must be popular too!"}
{"text":"A great first experience here.  Klaudio went out of his way to make us feel welcome.  We had a great bottle of wine thanks to the bartender's suggestion and an incredible meal.  The lamb kafteds were excellent with a light mint sauce.  Bread was nice and warm and fresh.  My Mia Bella pasta was outstanding with lots of flavor.  Everyone enjoyed their meals and my daughter said her tortellini special was the best she'd ever had.

The only thing I can gripe about is the lack of A/C.  It was hot inside but not unbearable.  But hey, it's summer in Cleveland!

We'll be back!!

{"text":"Just finished up at Mia Bella!! It was very good!! I ordered the Aracini to start... I was a little disappointed it wasn't a deep fried rice/mozzarella/ marinera sauce like I used to have in Sicily!! It was still A very delicious Veal meatball!! We also ordered the cheese tortellini and pasta alla Bolognese.
Both were very tasty!! I especially like the tortellini's because it had amazing flavor and peas and prosciutto in it!! It was a little bit more Americanized than I was expecting but the food was nevertheless delicious and the service was fantastic!!"}
{"text":"I brought my parents here for dinner when they were visiting from out-of-state. They (and I) loved it! The food was fantastic (its not fancy-shmantsy and tiny so you feel jipped, it's a real meal) and the employees were very kind. I had never had veal ravioli before and my waiter suggested I get half cheese/half ravioli so I can try. I am so glad I did! So yummy and buttery and delicious. The other dishes we had were the linguine blanco and the farfalle. We were all very satisfied with our meals and left stuffed (and with leftovers). 

When I see patio seating, I am not sure if it's casual or formal inside and I get nervous, but we all wore jeans and felt perfectly comfortable inside! For a sit-down restaurant, I would say this is my favorite in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"I always love this restaurant. It's warm inviting and always busy. Their food is delicious and the wine pairings work so well. Try the shrimp saganaki with pasta you will not regret it!"}
{"text":"So first off, I view Mia Bella kind of as the jewel of Cleveland's little Italy, the standard barer of its restaurant scene. I came here last year for Valentines and everything from the service to the food to the ambiance was superb.

I came in again with a large group of family and friends. We started with a couple bottles of wine and two plates of the calamari appetizer. They do their calamari a bit differently than what's considered traditional. They sautéed the calamari in a zesty red and cream based sauce. In it they accompanied the calamari pieces with various vegetables. We couldn't get enough!

I ordered the Gnocchi alla Romana, and had it done a bit spicy: kalamata olives, tomatoes, green peppers, shallots, roasted garlic. The gnocchi was so fresh and the dish all around was perfectly done.

To top it off the service was very attentive. They even went back and brought us some pita breads in lieu of bread they'd run short of. We had to have something to sop up all the delicious sauces.

Well done!"}
{"text":"We stopped by for lunch on a quick overnighter in Cleveland.  The arugula salad with burratta cheese was yummy.  Hot bread fresh from the oven with herbed butter - need I say more?  Husband said the red sauce was very flavorful and nicely spiced - a classic. I had the lobster ravioli in a vodka cream sauce which was especially delicious! Our sever, Mary, was so attentive and pleasant. She really made our lunch special. Great spot in Cleveland's Little Italy ! Loved the Italian music,  too!"}
{"text":"PLEASE BRING BACK THE LINGUINI BIANCO!!!!!!!! 

This place is as good as it gets in little italy and/or cleveland but they took the best dish off the menu! The linguini bianco is by far the best pasta dish and their seasonal pear/prosciutto salad is wonderful. I was so disappointed when I last visited and they had removed my favorite dish from the menu! The waitress told me they couldn't make it because they were busy and I had come all the way from Chicago just for Mia Bella and the Linguini Bianco! :("}
{"text":"Listen, I've only been here once, but it was effing delicious! We were at the art museum checking out Monet when one of my friends was getting super hangry (so hungry they turned cranky), so we finished up at the art museum and headed to Little Italy to give them the food coma they deserved. 

It was late Saturday afternoon so we were lucky to snag a parking spot on the street right outside the restaurant. Once inside we were greeted by warm and friendly staff and seated right away. We started off with some warm bread with herb butter then worked on appetizers of  pork belly ($11) and sauteed calamari. Both were presented beautifully and were full of flavor. For a main dish I got the special of fettuccine carbonara ($19) with cheese sprinkled on top - oh my lord so creamy and fresh my mouth was in heaven! A huge portion as well! I only ate half before I asked for a to-go container and you better believe I boxed that meal up myself so I could use the bread to soak up any remaining sauce on the plate. 

My dining companions enjoyed mimosas, espressos, and tiramisu which they all said they enjoyed. I had a bite (really like 4 bites) of the homemade tiramisu which was super tasty which I thought was surprising since I don't like coffee, but I would definitely order this next time!

I really have no complaints, just sad that when I reheated the pasta the sauce separated into this pool of oil, but that's what you get for using the microwave I guess. Overall it was a cozy, tasty, enjoyable time with friends at Mia Bella and I look forward to my next visit here!"}
{"text":"Randomly decided to pop in here on a Monday night since they are one of the very few Italian restaurants open late on a weekday and we were definitely not disappointed. The shrimp saganaki was so delicious. It's drenched in an amazing sauce that has a hint of spice to it. For entrees we had the lobster ravioli which our waiter swore by. Absolutely delicious but a tad bit salty. The ambiance is gorgeous and service is awesome. I would definitely recommend if you are in the mood for good Italian food."}
{"text":"My wife and I ate here as a recommendation from a vendor sponsored event. After reading several review as well and thought we give it a try. We are glad we did. That place was packed and we were fortunate to get a table. 
  
We started with avocado bruschetta and it was delicious. My wife had the cheese tortellini with meatball. She enjoyed it. I had the pesto penne with chorizo sausage. Very good. 

The service was good. Everyone was helping one another. The only issue I had had nothing to due with the restaurant. Parking can be a nightmare. Don't let that keep you from experiencing Mia Bella"}
{"text":"Ordered: White Sangria, Veal Ravioli

Ambiance: Clean bistro feel with a simple black and white/pastel palate. Service was friendly and prompt although we were one out of two couples at the time.

Food: The worst part of the meal was the sangria which was disappointingly bland, lacking any white wine or fruity flavor. My friend's red sangria, however, was much better. The food is where this place redeems itself, they have a very fresh and clean taste. The bread was my favorite being slighty crusty and filled with a light and airy center. The ravioli were perfectly cooked and generously sized. It was served in a tomato sauce which was the only misgiving. I felt the sauce itself needed to be rounded out somehow, it's tartness fills your mouth initially and doesn't taste balanced till you're halfway through the bite when the savory veal starts to really come through.

Overall this place was enjoyable, things tasted fresh, the menu was appealing, and dishes were presented well but it was not without it's flaws. I'm glad I tried this place and may come back but I think there's better places for the price out there."}
{"text":"The food was outstanding but the service was lacking. The cheese ravioli melted in your mouth and the sauce was incredibly flavorful.  Unfortunately we had to ask for bread (which was amazing) and refills on our water and coffee several times. The hostess was chomping on gum at the hostess stand and the servers did not work together. The bus boy however gets a thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Make your reservations early.  There's a reason that you have to wait, but it's well worth it.  The atmosphere is delightful, the service is excellent, and the food is scrumptious.  I had a glass of cab to go with my simple Mia Bella salad.  The portions are more than generous.  My linguini with marinara and two meatballs was delicious, and there was enough to take home for a second meal.  Others in our party were very pleased with their Albanian salad and lightly spiced mussels.  All in all, a very pleasant dining experience."}
{"text":"This is the real deal! This is quality food. The owner actually cooked are food today. The tomato sauce is very fresh flavor, I do enjoy. The award winning tortellini' were tender not heavy and the sauce was very tasty. I will come back."}
{"text":"My favorite Italian restaurant in Little Italy. The vibe, the service and the delicious food all add to the experience. We had Mike as our server, and he was great! There's nothing I love more than some pasta with red sauce. Simple, yet classic. And Mia Bella's tastes exactly like how my family makes it in Italy."}
{"text":"Nice setting, especially the second inside room. The staff were very accommodating with our minor changes, and they all seemed happy to be working here.

The restaurant generally has a youthful and hopping vibe, and may have even been a little too loud for me. That could also have been a function of the five young woman at the table next to us having downed more alcohol than their table manners would normally justify.

The appetizers were delicious, especially the sauces. The entree portions too were fairly large."}
{"text":"Went to Mia Bella's last night for dinner. We got there around 430 and were seated right away with no reservation. Ordered the arancini for an appetizer. It was basically 2 oversized meatballs that were not breaded like I was thinking it would be. The sauce was so spicey that my nose started running throughout the entire meal until we were done. It was so overwhelming that you could not enjoy any of the other flavors. Also disappointing was the risotto in the arancini was crunchy and grainy. After that we waited too long for our meals only to see 2 other tables that came in after us receive their meals while we waited. Nothing irritates me more than this. There's just no excuse as they also ordered pasta dishes like ourselves. I ordered the spaghetti with meatballs ($17 no salad included)  and my husband got the cheese ravioli ($14). The noodles were flat and wide like fettuccine which I don't care for with my spaghetti. It was just ok. My husbands ravioli was really good so we both ate his meal getting mine boxed. It now sits in the fridge. You have to ask for bread and make sure you do because it was by far the best part of our meal. Probably won't be going back."}
{"text":"Food was excellent.  Service was lacking. Had to ask for water and bread more than once."}
{"text":"My first time visiting Little Italy and I was so happy that we stopped here to get dinner! First, I'm not sure if you need reservations, but we were lucky enough to get a table for 4 around 6-7pm outside with no wait. Our server, Drew was hilarious and made great suggestions.

I feel like bread you're served before your mean is a great indicator for how your meal will be. The bread here.... WAS DELICIOUS! Crusty/ crispy on the outside & doughy in the middle. Perfect for me!

I ordered the cheese tortellini w/ sausage added (recommended by Drew), my boyfriend order the shrimp saganaki (originally an appetizer) with linguini pasta for an entree, and our 2 friends both ordered the Mia Bella pasta.

Although I enjoyed my cheese tortellini, I LOVED the shrimp saganaki with the linguini pasta! The Mia Bella were also good if you're looking for a red sauce.

Overall, I enjoyed my experience here & def recommend coming here!"}
{"text":"Great experience - just stumbled into this place for lunch and sat at the bar. Jessica, our bartender, was amazingly personable and offered delicious recommendations. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Tried to dine once but the wait was far too long. They offered to call me when a spot opened up by my tummy had already been filled. That's okay.

Second time I went we got right in and got a table up front. Our waitress was incredibly nice. We got some waters, some entrees, and some appetizers. Oh, and bread with butter! Can't forget the bread and butter...

I will come back here again when we have a taste for italian.

Note: I think they take reservations here. I am used to places not taking them so I never check anymore."}
{"text":"The cheese tortellini definitely lived up to the expectations. Super rich, delicious sauce covered in pancetta and some of the best tortellini I've ever eaten. I wish there was something to cut the heaviness of it all, though, like some citrus. Definitely not an everyday meal, but delicious nonetheless. 4.5 for sure."}
{"text":"This is the best Italian food I've ever had hands down.

Don't ever play yourself. Eat here."}
{"text":"Great restaurant in Little Italy. I heard that the line gets long so I decided to come at 4:30PM, when they open for dinner. It was a cute, quaint restaurant with outdoor seating. We started off with the complimentary bread which came to us piping hot. The bread had a crispy crust surrounding a soft, warm bread. It also came with seasoned garlic butter which was creamy and tasty, but I personally love bread more on its own. We ordered the calamari which I had originally expected it to be fried but it was in a tomato-y, lightly spiced sauce. The calamari wasn't chewy, and overall, the dish just worked well. I had their \"award winning\" tortellini and it was filling and delicious. The cheese filling wasn't overpowering the rest of the dish at all. The pasta was made well too. I love pasta, if you can't already tell..."}
{"text":"Really nice staff (the waitresses remembered me and my friends when we went back a second time), very accommodating (we bought lemons from them once, late at night), and good food (portions on the larger side, in general). I definitely want to be a regular. Happy hour from 4 to 6!"}
{"text":"First time back in mia Bella since the addition was completed and let me tell you the new space is amazing.  The room is just as lively as the original side but it has a different vibe. Additions of a new oyster bar and counter area facing directly into a new open kitchen where pizza, salads are prepared.  The food remains great as does the service.  Mia bella remains the power house of little Italy"}
{"text":"Tried this restaurant tonight... We were seated outside by a hostess wearing at shirt and yoga pants. There was music blaring, however, it was Spanish music, not Italian. Weird. We didn't even get acknowledged for 10 minutes upon being seated. 

Soup was cold. You had to ask for bread. What Italian restaurant makes you ask for bread? 

My dinner, veal braciole, was a huge disappointment. First, there was soooo much sauce on the pasta that I couldn't even find it. I literally scooped off an entire bread plate full of sauce before I uncovered the pasta. And the sauce was ice cold. The braciole was stuffed with ham, egg and some kind of cheese (which WAS NOT) mentioned on the menu. I don't eat eggs. However, I couldn't send it back or make adjustments because my waiter NEVER came back to the table after taking our order. We ate our meal without any beverages because we needed refills. No one came and checked on us during our entire meal. We stopped a busboy to get us water and our waiter. Our waiter still didn't come. He finally showed up with the check after I asked whether he had left for the evening! Took my uneaten dinner away without even asking how anything was. At that point, I just wanted to leave. 

We ended up going across the street for dessert, as I wouldn't spend another dime in this restaurant."}
{"text":"Food is outstanding as usual however the service is extremely slow. They put as many tables outside to increase the business however the kitchen can not handle the overflow. I will only come back in the colder months when the tables outside go away. I don't blame the owner for increasing his volume but to hurt your patronage from good customers is just not worth it."}
{"text":"Visited Mia Bella last Saturday to celebrate my wife's 40th birthday.  Arrived a little early at 5:00 p.m. and our reservation wasn't until 5:30.  We were still accommodated immediately even though the restaurant was packed at this early hour.

Mia Bella is a restaurant that I have wanted to visit for years, so I was very excited to finally make it here.  One thing thing that really surprised me immediately was the volume in the restaurant - very loud.  For some reason I had it in my head that it would be quiet, relaxing, and intimate, and this definitely wasn't the case.  Nevertheless, the atmosphere was still very good, just not what I expected.  

My wife opts for a pepperoni and mushroom pizza on gluten-free crust.  I order the award winning cheese tortellini.  For drinks I try the water (I'm quite the party animal) and my wife orders a Mojito which she thought was solid.  About 10 minutes after ordering, our waiter brings three slices of some of the best bread I have ever had to our table - the herb butter really pushed it over the edge.  The bread was so good that I felt a bit guilty devouring it in the company of my poor gluten-free wife.

The food comes around the 30 minute mark and is damn good.  The cheese tortellini is spicy and everything about the dish is just right (the portion size was crazy too).  Typically I am turned off by extra-sized portions, but in this case I was happy to be taking leftovers home.  My wife RAVED about her gluten-free pizza declaring it even better than Borgata's Pizza Cafe in Columbus, which had been the previous standard to measure other GF pizzas against.  We didn't care for the flavor of the meatballs. I think these may have been a veal / beef mixture.  Texture was wonderful, flavor just wasn't our thing.

I can't remember what kind of financial damage I did here, but whatever it was I know it was well worth it.  Our waiter was very professional, but a little dry.  I honestly have nothing bad to say about Mia Bella's.  It lived up to the hype and unfortunately I probably will be unable to talk my wife into trying any of the other restaurants in the area.  ***One final note: parking is nearly impossible in Little Italy unless you use M.V.P. Valet Parking - look for the signs on Mayfield road very close to Mia Bella's.  You will see guys all over the place with M.V.P shirts / vests on.  We arrived at the early hour of 5:00 p.m. and still couldn't find a spot anywhere.  After driving around for fifteen minutes we parked at another restaurant and the lot attendant took pity on us, and when I say \"us\" I mean my wife, and let us park there for $5."}
{"text":"I visited every restaurant in little Italy, and keep returning to Mia Bella.  The staff is friendly, and the food is divine!
I'm not a huge fan of eggplant, but the appetizer just melts in your mouth, with ricotta cheese and lots of mozzarella, yum!!

I've heard that the veal piccata is the best dish in the house, but I can't steer away from the pasta verde or prosciutto pasta.

Great for family events, great for dates, great to just sit at the bar and order a gin gimlet - everything here is perfect.  Don't bother with the rest!

Parking in all of little italy sucks, so take the first curb spot you find along the way!"}
{"text":"Five stars if you like good non-corporate Italian food.  6 Stars if you're seriously Gluten Free and actually want to enjoy pasta again.  


The ambiance is great, especially outside, inside isnt too bad but its a little crowded.  The drink prices are typical of Little Italy, so neutral there.  


Where they really shine is the variety and quality of Italian cuisine, and Customer Service.  I've had a handful of the items on the menu - and we always have enough for a healthy leftover portion, which tastes great the next day.  My wife is GF and we go here exclusively now, as they are the only place in Little Italy that tries to make GOOD GF Pasta and they actually do a great job at it. 


Last time we were here we had a new waiter, who accidentally didn't bring us our leftovers (and we left without them)  and gave her a dish with bread'stuff in it... Not a big deal, but we asked the owner (I think) about it - and he was like  'Sorry that guys new' - 'How about I Cook you a bran new GF Meal and give you a beer? Would that make things right?'  Me:  \"Yeah a $4 Peroni and a $15 Meal for the $5 worth of foods we lost would be MORE than Enough!\"  


Contrary to what others may have said here, the Owner/Manager is hyper-attentive, and customer-service driven.  I love this place, thanks guys!"}
{"text":"Another yummy nook in Little Italy. I tried the margherite pizza. Although, to be fair, their four seasons pizza blends all the toppings so it looks much yummier than globs of mozz, tom, and basil. Eat it fast because the topping soaks right down to the bottom and makes for a soggy crust.

Watch out for their happy hour specials. That's minus $2 off apps - not $2 apps!"}
{"text":"Awesome Italian food is such in another league then the Americanized stuff thats so readily available.  Sat on the patio and enjoyed the shrimp saganaki and the cheese tortellini.  Yelp was helpful for dinner selection.  The flavors were awesome though both dishes were pretty creamy.  I am already look forward to future meals here.  The pastas enough for two people.  We just shared those dishes and we still had some tortellini to take home.  Pricing her is on point with the large portion size.  Its about 20$ per person to dine here but you get a 40$ per person type of experience.  Loved my meals here but presentation at Nora close by brings this place to a 4 instead of 5."}
{"text":"I am so happy to have gotten a chance to eat at Mia Bella, the gem of Little Italy, before I moved from the Cle. A group of 12 of us went to celebrate after graduation, and we had a great time. We had a whole bunch of food restrictions amongst the group and I have to say that in a meat and lard lovin' town that the Cle prides itself in (oh man I miss you already), Mia Bella has a diverse menu with options to satisfy anyone. The restaurant is small and I recommend making reservations. Our server was friendly and attentive. Everything I tried that night was delicious, but definitely rich. The eggplant parmesan was sooo good. My carbonara was decadent and just like how a carbonara should be. I tried bits of the ribeye steak (huge portion), risotto (very light and fresh, surprisingly), and pasta verde. My favorite was my mom's cheese tortellini. I usually am not a fan of tortellini but this was so GD delicious. The sauce was slightly spicy and very flavorful. All of the portions were large and made for hearty leftovers the next day. Overall, Mia Bella has great food and is perfect for family gatherings."}
{"text":"Loved this place! Was in town on business and looking for a place to eat with someone who had a lot of food allergies. The staff was very accommodating and took good care of us.  

The only downside is the parking is limited to street parking.  

Would come here again!"}
{"text":"Very, very good! Exceeded my expectations, for sure. The bread and butter were delicious!  Bread was warm and soft and the butter was creamy and had pepper (?) that added flavor. The cheesy tortellini is amazing. If you can't decide what to get, get this. You'll be happy. A chicken kabob salad was also ordered and that turned out good too."}
{"text":"Came here with a group of 8, and the service and food we all had couldn't have been better. 

Having most of my recent italian dining experiences in the North End of Boston, I was skeptical of what the Little Italy of Cleveland could deliver. This place knew what they were doing, and was actually much better than some of my Boston experiences! 

The atmosphere is modern and cozy, it is a small place but our group was comfortable. 

We shared a few appetizers, the calamari wasn't breaded so I was expecting something different. I wouldn't order it again, but it wasn't bad. 

I had a glass of wine and the salmon dish and I shared a side of the risotto, the portion was perfect. 

The prices were awesome too. Most people had a drink, we had appetizers, and then the dinners. With a 20% tip we got out of there paying around $350. Authentic Italian at a reasonable price! I'll be back next time I am in the area for sure."}
{"text":"Drove 4 hours into town, checked into the hotel at the Cleveland clinic. Was excited to see Mia Bella was open until 10:30. Tired and hungry we sat down at the bar to order food at 9:35. Looked at the menu, decided what we wanted and then was told the kitchen was closed! They said they closed early because they were slow, however the restaurant had at least 20 people in it. 
What a terrible way to treat customers- they could have at least offered us bread and a salad. To top it off they were rude and a matter of fact, like we were expecting something that was unreasonable!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and vibe. The food is fantastic and probably some of the best Italian food that I've ever had. Unfortunately I have to take one star off due to the wait staff obviously struggling to keep up with the high volume that the restaurant can get. Our waiter was very apologetic for this though."}
{"text":"Great food, consistently excellent in the small, family owned restaurant in Little Italy.  Several returns here show how good food can be served, made to order in fair sized portions at reasonable prices.  Service is professional and friendly. Owners treat guests as family.

Bravo!  I can't wait to return."}
{"text":"Mia Bella is our go-to date night spot. The atmosphere is classy, but not snobby. The wait staff is friendly and helpful. The menu has variety, but isn't so broad that you have to question if the chefs know what their doing. In the summer you'll have all of these amenities on top of beautiful outdoor seating. Oh - and the bread and butter is exceptional.

Get the spicy cheese tortellini. And, the Mia Bella pasta with meatballs will not disappoint.

Oh, and tiramisu for dessert!!"}
{"text":"The Linguini Bianco with shrimp was absolutely wonderful. Sweet little restaurant with good service and great food. Street parking only but definitely worth the difficulty parking."}
{"text":"The reviews and word of mouth are all great regarding this restaurants food.  I 100% am in agreeable that the Italian food is both authentic and delicious! Went here for dinner with friends and sat out on the patio..nice weather and great sceneries people watching in Clevelands \"little italy\" now parking in this area does sorta suck so I suggest just being patient in finding a someone leaving and grabbing their parking spot.  The bread at Mia Bellas was meh..the entrees: cheese tortellini with chicken amazing and a must try! If you are not wanting spicy then I suggest the spaghetti with meatballs or the shrimp appetizer dish (forgot the name) over linguine is yummy! Another great dish a friend ordered was the lobster ravioli.  You can't go wrong with any of these!"}
{"text":"Ok.  I know.  Little Italy great food everywhere because Italian food is great food.   When made made by Albanians?  Served by a mix of Serbian and Greeks.   He'll yes.     This place is awesome.   Slow start.  Tight quarters.   Salads nothing over the top.  But. But.  
The entrees are ridiculous.  Great flavor.  You must have the house special.  Not on the menu.  Saginaw kind over pasta.  It's an appetizer over pasta.  It's crazy.  Ask for Mike. He is a funny but knowledgeable waiter.   Dessert there is better than Corbos and prestis. Yes I said it."}
{"text":"I wish Mia Bella was close to home. If it was, I would be a regular. The food is outstanding. I highly recommend trying a variety of sides and appetizers.  They are all excellent portions that multiple people can share. 

We ordered the following appetizers and sides. 
Garlic toast
Burratta, which was presented on a big board with toast and salad, fantastic!
A side of the mushroom risotto, so good. 
Fried Eggplant, which was like multiple round ravioli with ricotta and awesome marinara. 
Margherita pizza, awesome
Side of meatballs in that awesome marinara, so flavorful!"}
{"text":"My husband was in the Cleveland clinic so we asked around for great places to eat. This one kept being mentioned so we decided to give it a try. Great service. Great food and pretty good prices. Some of the best eggplant parm I have ever had. Caesar salad was great. Only draw back is the place is small and extremely crowded. Definitely recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"A friend who goes to Case Western recommended Mia Bella, and it was a pleasant dinner. We were able to make a reservation about two hours ahead of time. Parking was disastrous - unless you're VERY lucky, don't expect to find any parking on a Sunday night at 6:30 PM. We were forced to do valet parking, but it wasn't too expensive.
We were seated promptly and given menus, but then practically every waiter ignored us for almost 20 minutes. Apparently no one knew who was supposed to serve us - this is unacceptable for a small restaurant. 
The waiter who eventually came was extremely apologetic and was very friendly and helpful. We ordered the baked veggies and as per Yelp reviews, the cheese tortellini. Both dishes were tasty and filling! We were also given two free cannoli as an apology for the wait, which was nice.
Overall, a cozy and romantic restaurant with good food, but be wary of parking and service."}
{"text":"Snowflakes falling on my coat, the wind cutting through my layers of fabric - nothing could warm me faster than a dish from this local gem. Eggplant parmesian and cheese tortellini, fresh pasta with amazing flavor. The robust tomato, hugged by the curves of fresh mozzarella and topped with fresh basil is an experience to say the least. Ohh Yeahhh"}
{"text":"Delicious meals. Perfect for special occasions. The Mia Bella pasta is unbelievably good. Pricey, but the food was fantastic."}
{"text":"I haven't had Italian in soo long but this place was definitely refreshing! Complimentary bread is available upon awaiting for your order. I ordered the infamous tortellini and was very satisfied! Great service, great food and a very casual environment!"}
{"text":"Everything from the service/staff members to food was fantastic! Before coming to Cleveland I knew I had to try Mia Bella's.

We decided to try the appetizer Shrimp Saganaki (~$13) which was really good. The sauce is creamy and light. It went really well with the shrimp and cheese. The sauce was so good that I wanted to ask for another batch of bread so I can dip it into the sauce, but I had self control and decided not to :3

Speaking of the complementary bread, which you must request, was also great with the seasoned butter. Soft and warm in the middle but crunchy on the outside. I also love the sesame seeds, adds a nice nutty flavor to it.

The S.O. got the Lobster Ravioli ($20), which is a season special. We both give is a 5/5. The sauce was great as well as the filling. No artificial meat, all lobster.

I got the famous Cheese Tortellini ($19). There's a reason why it's a Little Italy Award Winner. Everything about the dish was great. The portion size was more than generous as well!

We had a wonderful server, Megan, who made sure everything came out at a timely manner and made sure everything was going well.

I've read this place gets pretty busy. We came on a Tuesday night, around 6pm and we were seated right away with no reservations. I noticed about around 6:20 pm, the place started to get packed.

I don't think I'll be coming back to Cleveland anytime soon, however, if I know anyone that is I will definitely be referring them to Mia Bella's in Little Italy!"}
{"text":"Great local spot.  I sat at the bar since I was dining alone while in town for work.  Bartender was great at guiding me through the menu."}
{"text":"Delicious food for a nice night out! 

We came here on a Monday night with several people (I made a reservation the day before just in case they were busy on a Monday). We had company in town from California and wanted a nice dinner out for their last night. We also had a toddler with us, which was not a problem. Others have said \"not good for kids\", but I feel its a judgement call on what your kid can handle - anyway, they have at least one highchair and were able to bring out a few crayons when asked (the tables are covered in paper). 

The waiter we had was nice, and was able to answer all the questions we had regarding the menu and wine. It was our first time here, and we had lots of questions. The waiter also made some excellent recommendations regarding dinner.

We all ordered different items (appetizers, salads, soups, entree) and were able to sample a lot of the items on the menu. Everything at our table was great. Portions for soups, salads, and appetizers were reasonable. Entree portions were large, and we did have a little left over. 

This was our first venture into Little Italy since moving here, and I thought we made a great choice!"}
{"text":"My message is a follow up message of Anthony M's review... I was his guest at dinner that night he describes and initially planned to be there 30 minutes after his arrival so that he could catch up with a guy friend before my arrival.  I must be honest in that we were very excited to try this restaurant out but immediately displeased with the chaos and unorganized environment of which we had to sit in... it was giving me heart palpatations.  There was no Hostess stand, there were no available greeters, there was little assistance... just a room full of crowded tables and chairs.  

On the positive side our server, whose name was Candy was top notch and she was so accommodating and went out of her way to ensure that she provided us with the best possible care.  

As for the food... being 100% Italian myself I have to admit this is far from Italian... perhaps Mediterranean is a stretch but it is just quasi-medicore type food.  My chicken was terribly dry... and my couscous which was soaked in marina sauce was very undesirable.  I took 2 bites of chicken and one bite of the couscous and couldn't go any further.  It was a complete waste of the $200 we all spent on dinner.

Finally... I must warn those that write reviews... the owner as he called himself... a man who is 30 years old that claims to have been cooking for 15 years was so angry at Anthony's review that he aggressively harassed Anthony by text and voice messages that eventually Anthony accepted his call... the way this man spoke in a hostile tone with a foul mouth of horrible swear words, threats of entering Anthony's place of employment (whom is a chef also for Wolfgang Puck) saying he would slander his name, reputation, and food... it was a very scary situation to hear about when all we did was go to a restaurant to have a nice dinner and it was not at all a nice dinner.  These things happen for various reasons... unfortunately on this evening it was not a good night for Mia Bella.  

I do believe that being in Little Italy places a higher standard on food quality, customer service, and dining experience.  Perhaps we are a tough group since one of us is a highly talented Chef and another one of us is 100% Italian eating at the finest of Italian restaurants and home made meals... but the fact remains that it was unpleasant while we were there and after receiving  a threatening, aggressive call from someone who claims to be an owner is just far from professional.  I would highly recommend Mia Bella have a sensitivity training, as well as, proper customer service speaking skills.  No one should ever get a call being threatened for just being honest...  there was not one effort on Mia Bella to correct the situation... I would caution anyone from a safety standpoint.  

I do hope your dining experiences are better then ours."}
{"text":"I have been to Little Italy a handful of times and every time I end up here...but I'm not complaining! 

The first time I came, we only ordered drinks. They were pretty good. I had some sort of berry lemonade concoction - very sweet, but delicious. 

I always order the cheese tortellini - I can't help myself. It is amazing. The sauce is perfect-slightly spicy and creamy. Add in pasta with cheese, peas and prosciutto and you have an incredible dish. I want to try something else every time I come, but I never do.

Make a mental note: you have to ask for bread!! Who doesn't always want bread?

I have also tasted the baked veggies dish with sausage and it has a great smokey flavor to it. I've tasted the eggplant parmesan and it's very good also.

My last visit, the service was a little slow and our waiter was only to been seen a few times but that wouldn't stop me from coming back.

This is definitely a great spot in Little Italy."}
{"text":"Could have used a little bit more Parmesan on top, but with the cobble stone streets and old school look, Little Italy in Cleveland legitimately feels like it's still run by the mob, so I was too scared to piss anyone off by asking for more cheese."}
{"text":"Was visiting Cleveland a week ago and wanted Italian and was lucky enough to find Mia Bella via yelp.  We didn't have a reservation, which I highly recommend, but were lucky enough to get the last open table. It's an intimate setting with excellent service and food was impeccable.  I started with the PEI mussels, which were excellent, and had the osso bucco special with risotto as my entree.  The osso bucco was easily in the top five plates of food I ever had.  

Nothing bad to say at all.  I'll definitely go back when I'm in Cleveland.  I'm a big fan."}
{"text":"My overall experience eating here was absolutely excellent. We were standing at the bar waiting to get a drink before our table was ready, and the manager came over and insisted that we sit down at an open table and that they would bring us our drinks so that we could relax. The excellent service continued through dinner. I got the Mia Bella pasta with meatballs, which were absolutely amazing and paired well with my Chianti. Will definitely go back next time I'm in Cleveland."}
{"text":"If you can, make a reservation ahead of time.  If you have to wait and you're down for a beverage or a sweat treat then you are in luck b/c there are many great places to pop into just steps away as you wait for your table.  The food was fabulous and I was pleased that they didn't mind putting mint into my G&T...it was perfect."}
{"text":"Took the wife here for a pre Valentine's Day dinner. Sure you can always find things to complain about at a busy restaurant on a busy street. If you can let all that go...awesome place with a great staff and really good food."}
{"text":"Omg aside from the atmosphere the food was well worth the wait sooooo delicious sooooo fresh this was our first time here and the Valet suggested we eat here! Our waitress Lilly was amazing she knew her menu and wines I had the delicious Chicken Pasta Verde with white truffle oil yummm my friend had the Lobster surf an turf and her daughter had the Shrimp Pasta Verde with white truffle oil and to top off the night we got to meet the CHEF he's so cute  he came over to meet us. And last but certainly not least the fresh coconut gelato with strawberries and fresh whipped cream. I would recommend this place anytime!"}
{"text":"Visited my hometown for my niece's wedding last weekend. Friday evening we decided to try Mia Bella based on its reviews & menu. It was such a wonderful experience. The food, ambiance and service were outstanding. Tara, our server, was amazing. Can't wait to return next time we're in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Everybody seems to love Mia Bella, so I know I'm the outlier here and maybe they just had a bad day, but overall my experience was underwhelming.

Had the shrimp saganaki for starters and the plate was cold, lacked consistency and was a little bit too salty.

Then I had a pizza and it was equally underwhelming, the dough almost looked of the frozen kind and the whole thing was missing something.

They were pretty crowded, so that might have done it, but overall I don't get the rave reviews, especially about the Italian authenticity. If you've been to Italy you know that's not the case.

But I may give it another chance because everybody can have a less stellar day."}
{"text":"This was definitely one of the best restaurant experiences we have ever had! Located in Little Italy, the ambiance was authentic and unmatched! 

I have never written Yelp review before but this place deserves one! 10/10 would recommend to anyone - no matter the distance! 

You can make a reservation which is recommended because it is packed due to the popularity! The service was extremely quick and efficient. All the staff was very friendly and diligent in their jobs. 

Now... onto the FOOD! Unbelievable. Really. Affordable, huge portion sizes, and mouth-watering good. 3 of us shared our meal and we had a pizza as an appetizer. Then, the Mia Bella pasta with 2 sides of meatballs and Cheese Tortalleni for dinner. Amazing."}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible. I purchased a coupon on restaurant.com for this place. Just visited on Wednesday. The hostess was snippy, and she didn't even tell us that there were seats available outside. So we waited a half hour to be seated inside not knowing we could have been seated outside immediately. Our server was extremely inattentive! We had to ask someone else for water. Also our drinks had barely any alcohol in them! My coupon was a minimum of two entrees to receive the $25 off. Pasta dishes I found out weren't included as an entree which I thought was bizarre since most Italian places in Little Italy they are considered entrees, so we had a limited selection to begin with. On top of that THEY DIDN'T HAVE HALF OF THE ENTREES LISTED! This was at 8 pm on a Wednesday!! I don't eat seafood so I was stuck with this Mia Bella Special which was absolutely terrible. It was like an oversized helping of a Stouffer's meal with chicken and vegetables. ALSO! They didn't have any bread!? What kind of Italian restaurant doesn't have any bread left? Go bake some!!! WOW. At the end we had to go up to the bar to pay our bill since our waiter kept us waiting for 15 minutes and the place had barely anyone in it at that point. It was around 9:45ish PM. This was by far the worst Little Italy experience ever! Bad service, bad food. WILL NEVER GO BACK!"}
{"text":"It's very hard for a place to impress me in every way as I am a New York native and have had some of the best food this country has to offer. This place is as authentic as any  Italian American place can be. My wife and I loved the atmosphere to start off with and then service is on a different level. Then came the best .... The food. I ordered oysters and shrimp appetizers and both were absolutely amazing. I then had an arugula salad and my wife had a margarita pizza. We both looked at each other and were extremely satisfied with the meals. This place can easily compete with restaurants in New York, LA and Chicago. Will defiantly go there again."}
{"text":"Wow. My new favorite place in Little Italy!!!! I have to eat gluten free and their selection was amazing! I have been back three times and tried all different gluten free menu options and have yet to find something I did not love!!!!! 
The service was good. A few of the servers were newer and still learning the menu and wine list, but that's okay! That takes time! 
I recommend the risotto with chicken!!!!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with my family of 4 before heading to the Children's Museum. Easy parking even on a Sunday during a football game. Fast service, but maybe that is because we came right when they opened. 

The bread and butter is absolutely delicious! Love that it comes out hot and fresh. The two pizzas we ordered were good, not the best I have ever had, but good. The buffalo mozzarella app needs a little work. The tomato I received was completely hard, and I like a little evoo/balsamic/ or salt along with mine. Nothing to be found on the table.

All in all this was a good little find."}
{"text":"Great experience. Clean interior. Tables well-spaced out. Good service. I had the linguine bianco with meatballs on the side and my friend had the linguini bolongese with meatballs. Pasta was cooked perfectly al dente with the right proportion of sauce. The meatballs are a must-have. Will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times now and it's pretty good. I have had better Italian food in Boston and in my hometown of Chicago, but I'd have to say this is our current go to place for Italian food in Cleveland. It's good, not great, cozy, and friendly staff. I'm still on the hunt for better Italian food in the Cleveland area."}
{"text":"My husband and I went there for the first time on a romantic date. It's a quaint little restaurant and is good for romantic date nights. Food was nothing special. Every time I pass there, there are lines of people waiting. I don't get what all the hype is about. I felt the price was insanely high for the quality of the food. Maybe both of us got the wrong item on the menu? But it was a pretty mediocre meal. Neither of us were impressed. Probably won't be going back.

Update: after writing a negative review for Mia Bella, I was messaged by someone from the business. They were very rude, and told me I was making up nonsense and should not return to their establishment. (How are they still in business?!) Terrible, terrible customer service! I will not be returning and will be tell those I know to do them same."}
{"text":"Okay, so be prepared. The portions are huge. And the portions are tasty. So you're probably going to be rolled out of here. It's helpful that the RTA station is downhill!

Great staff who were attentive and helpful. The young lady who take care of me mentioned that she's very aware of dietary restrictions due to the near presence of the hospital. So it that's a concern for you, be calm.

I ordered the cheese tortellini right off the menu and it was absolutely delicious. I already mentioned the big portion, but the cheesiness here was great. Lots of flavor, including some heat from peppers, the snap of the peas and the firm bite of the pasta. Just perfect. And yes, I scooped up ALL of the sauce with the bread.

Oh, and that bread is awesome too. Delish.

Fair looking wine list with some specials, but I opted for a Great Lakes Dortmunder to go with mine. It was excellent."}
{"text":"In Cleveland for 1 night and chose this place based on Yelp and the hotels reccomendation.  Wow!  Naitive New Yorkers are italian food snobs, but this place was a home run.   Had the Zuppe De Pesche soup, Eggplant Parm appetizer and the Braciole.  Awesome.  The wife had the Beet Salad and Veal Picata. The entire meal was fantastic. Their marinara was amazing. Even the bread was good.  Will come back if I am in ever back in town."}
{"text":"Great restaurant in Cleveland's Little Italy!!! Right on the heart of Little Italy with indoor and outdoor seating. Friendly and prompt service. Great for families! Clean and warm welcoming atmosphere. Everything we had, from appetizers to dessert was delicious!!! I have a gluten allergy, yet we love Italian..... usually a problem for me. They actually have AWESOME gluten free pasta!!!! It tastes like real pasta and was prepared a perfect al dente!!! A real first!! We enjoyed a bottle of wine, delicious food and the World Cup! Couldn't ask for more. This was our first visit and we will be back!! Be sure to ask for Daniel to be your server!"}
{"text":"Best restaurant in Little Italy by far. It has great service and our waitress Candice was so nice and attentive. I had the Chicken Parmagian which was very big (and not even on the menu) but great and for dessert I had a classic tiramisu which might have been the best dessert I have ever had. I definitely recommend this to anyone."}
{"text":"It was the best of meals; it was the worst of meals... Yes, I'm exaggerating. It was neither of those. I'm not really sure how to review this place, so I'll start with the good, then move on to the terrible.
The service was impeccable and the environment was welcoming and full of Italian-ish charm.  I had all the water my heart could ever desire and was fully informed of all the specials.  I started with the shrimp saganaki as an appetizer because of the handy \"taste of Italy\" statement next to it. I was initially denied bread for a bit because I'd need it to sop up the sauce. This did make me want to fight the waiter, but the appetizer came out with little delay so it was all fine.  The shrimp turned out to be sitting on a bed of mozzarella and swimming in a creamy tomato sauce and using the fresh, crusty bread to wipe it up was divine.  I definitely didn't eat 5 slices of bread by myself.  Except I did and I regret nothing. 
What I do regret was moving on to the veal Piccata. It was oddly acidic (maybe from all the capers) and the meat was weirdly colored (very very pale).  The pasta was edible and fine.  But that meat was not.  I'm not saying that it made me sick, but it wasn't great (at least not to me).
In summary, eat the bread.  Don't eat the veal."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Italian place in town (and that's an honor... there are a lot of Italian places!). The restaurant is small but the atmosphere is pleasant, making the food taste even better than it already does. The pizza is the best I've ever had and the pasta is good too. This place is kind of pricey, but it's your best choice for an upscale Italian dinner."}
{"text":"Great experience last night at Mia Bella!  We were seated on the patio with our dogs and the service was fantastic, as was the food (sorry that our dogs were being cranky a**holes).  We started out with a Dogfish head 60 minute, a glass of wine and the clams appetizer.  The clams were large and delicious.  I ordered the gnocchi with their homemade tomato sauce with olives, onions, peppers, shallots and roasted garlic.  It was delicious!  The husband had the bolognese which he loved.  We will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"In Cleveland for a few days for work and after landing at the hotel I started checking out nearby restaurants. It was snowing so the jury was out about getting back into the car to go out. A friend recommended Little Italy and turns out it's only a mile and a half away from my hotel!
The first restaurant to pop up was MIA Bella so I made my way.  It was meant to be because I found street parking directly in front of this brick lined street and restaurant. (Valet station in front of restaurant different times of the week.) as I parked I heard music being played from the ?? Restaurant? It was snowy so I didn't identify where it was coming from.  Magical! It was a snowy Monday so it wasn't busy (yet) and I snagged a seat at the bar. 
The friendly bartender was on it with a glass of Tempranillo and water- some bread to munch on with herb butter while I made an important dining decision.  
Turns out it was hard to decide which pasta to eat - but with his recommendation I went for the Spicy cheese tortellini with prosciutto, peas, and tomatoes.  It was perfect! Not too spicy, full of flavor- rich!   Turns out I should have brought more of an appetite and couldn't finish it (nice portion).  Sadly I had to take some cannoli home (how tragic)! It was fine to go (the cannoli) and a great blend of crisp shell and luscious filling.  As you can tell- I hated it (NOT)! 
May want to go back before I leave the area..."}
{"text":"Great restaurant on a sleepy night in Little Italy 

I almost ate too much and I really enjoyed the single malt (I think I had a couple Macallan 12s)... 

The linguine with sausage was super tasty and lasted two days!

Compliments to the chef(s) and the gorgeous hostess, bartender and our waitress..."}
{"text":"I was in the mood for some Italian food, and I saw that this restaurant was highly rated on Yelp, so I came here with 3 of my friends to give it a try. I will admit that I am not an expert when it comes to Italian food.

The wait was very long - we went on a Friday evening, and it took an hour for us to get an outdoor table. That is to be expected on a Friday evening in Little Italy.

We all ordered different things - I got the chicken risotto, my friends got the cheese tortellini, carbonara, and something else that I can't remember. Bread comes as a complimentary starter - the bread was nothing special, but the herb butter was well seasoned and very flavorful.

We all shared each other's dishes, but I was particularly fond of the risotto. A lot of Italian dishes tend to be just a bit too cheesy for me, but the risotto had no cheese and instead had a wide variety of vegetables. The rice was also very soft and chewy, as opposed to being very tough to chew. Overall an excellent meal, though just a bit overpriced for the serving size."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here to celebrate our anniversary.  Excellent food.  Excellent service.  Cannot say enough about the attentiveness and knowledge of the wait staff!   My husband ordered the cheese tortellini topped with chicken that \"could easily be cut with a fork\" and I had the Mia Bella pasta with shrimp.  We shared a Mia Bella salad.  Ended the dinner with a shared dessert of salted Carmel chocolate soufflé topped with vanilla bean gelato.  Amazing Pino Grigio with my dinner.  Little Italy is never a disappointment."}
{"text":"This eatery in Little Italy is everything I want in an Italian place. It has an outdoor patio, you get to sit and people watch while enjoying the views of all the little shops in the area, and the food is fantastic. The gnocchi was fantastic, and had so much flavor. I feel in many restaurants nowadays the gnocchi itself has little flavor, but Mia Bella's gnocchi was an exception. I also ordered a fancy margherita pizza which was just as yummy, and so so fresh. 

Great location, great service, great food."}
{"text":"Delicious!  The salad, gluten free pizza and linguine with meatballs all were excellent!"}
{"text":"Came to Little Italy to celebrate our wedding anniversary. This was our first visit to Mia Bellal. The food was delicious and perfectly prepared. I had a seasonal special - clam linguini, my husband had cheese tortellini with meatballs. We had the spicy shrimp in tomato cream sauce to start. All of it was wonderful. Perhaps even better than the food, was the service. Our waitress Tara, was helpful with information and suggestions, and very attentive  without being intrusive, though the restaurant when we arrived. I also really appreciated that there wasn't any music playing, so we could talk easily."}
{"text":"The best cream-based pasta in Little Italy?  The linguini bianco with chicken.  Nice large portion, chicken grilled perfectly, just enough tomato so you get the flavor without it tasting like a marinara, and just enough cream so as not to feel like you are gaining weight with every bite.

The service is great here, and I also love the ambience.  Eat outside under the umbrellas on a nice day, look out over the cobblestones of Little Italy's main streets, sit back, relax and maybe for a moment or two, you'll get a feeling like you are actually in Italy, enjoying a lovely dinner in a quaint little cafe."}
{"text":"We went on a referral from the hotel we were staying at and boy what a gem! Luckily a reservation a had cancelled so we were lucky and were seated right away (reservations recommended). The staff was so helpful as we had our 1 year old with us. Just go they are great and food was awesome you won't be disappointed. We are making this a regular spot for our Italian."}
{"text":"Mia Bella leans toward \"meh\" more often than not. The staff tend to seem a little lack-luster, missing your table or not even offering to box the last of your meal. The big dining room makes the entire experience loud and not particularly intimate. But mostly, the food falls flat. Compared to other Little Italy restaurants, or even other Italian restaurants in the city, Mia Bella lacks flavor, style and selection."}
{"text":"The best Italian restaurant in the Cleveland area. Ironically it is not owned or operated by Italians, but Albanians.  Try the Veal Piccata. It is the best.  Service is excellent and customers are treated like family."}
{"text":"Went for Valentine's Day with my bae. It was so good. Dress nice Bc it's a little fancy in there. Pasta was so good and I got an ice cold Peroni beer too. Make reservations at least a day before Bc it's hard to get a table . Worth it though . We'll be back ."}
{"text":"Recently on a Saturday afternoon, decided to enjoy a late lunch before heading to the airport. Upon entering, I was greeted with the smell of great italian food and I knew that I was in good hands. I sat at the bar and I asked the bartender Jessica to assist me with selections. I started with shrimp saginacci, then continued with a half order of cheese tortellini. I drank Chianti and ended with a chocolate  dessert which with was topped with bailey's flavored ice cream. Everything including the service was fabulous. So much so that the remainder of my dishes packaged so that I could finish it later. I would happily return to this lovely location if I am craving Italian cuisine in the future."}
{"text":"One word: amazing! They know how to do gluten free the right! We enjoyed the thin crust GF pizza which is amazing and the sauce was like none other! We also enjoyed the house red suave on GF pasta. Again...amazing. We sampled some GF mushroom risotto and roasted potatoes. Seriously amazing. A MUST eat place!"}
{"text":"2nd review: Service slow. Calamari not deep fried and not good. Caesar salad average. Scallops four average size swimming in tomatoes. Not good. 

1st review: Amazing! Everything was great from the bread and butter to the lobster bisque, salad (watercress, crab, persimmon, black truffle, cranberry), cheese tortellini, tuna with risotto. The waiter was great and so was the service. Best dining ext."}
{"text":"Great place with authentic Italian food and very reasonable prices and servings. The waiters are very nice and attentive."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, great food, and not pricey.  The wait staff has always been overly friendly and it is very hard to find any complaints here. The patio in front is very bourgeois and in only the best ways!"}
{"text":"i would say my favorite fancy restaurant in little italy despite that they upped the prices recently. both fancy and casual attire are suitable which is great. they now offer free bread and butter and dont give you crap about asking more so for me that makes up the price adjustments which is why i still like it. they generally have a lot of choices of pasta and its decent. i got this cheese pasta and it was good but a little too heavy even though i really love cheese. my boyfriend got the original red sauce pasta. you can add extra protein(chicken,fish,steak,etc) but its like 5 dollars more and they dont give you a whole lot but he eats like 5 meals a day and he felt really full when he finished the whole thing. the calamari appetizer is good. the steak in medium rare is only okay considering how pricey it is.  the servers are very nice. they get really busy on weekends sometimes to a point where you have to call in a week in advance to reserve a spot. losing two stars cause the foods not AMAZING esp considering the price."}
{"text":"Our second try for a Italian Restaurant in Little Italy. I think I found a good Italian Restaurant! I had the Clam pasta and the pasta was cooked \"al dente\" and the others flavors was perfect match. 
Keep a space for the desert!!! Very taste full."}
{"text":"Mia Bella is absolutely fantastic! Every time we come to Cleveland we always make time for a romantic dinner here. Right in the middle of Little Italy, Mia Bella is the perfect combination of charm, ambience, service and quality. A tiny spot that's perfect for a romantic date or even a business meeting. It does books up quickly so be sure to make a reservation as there's no place to really wait for a table, however weather permitting you could browse the quaint shops and cafes of Little Italy while you wait. Fantastic food and service every time! I highly encourage you to enjoy a glass or bottle of wine from a solid list of offerings, savor their hot bread and inquire about any daily specials before making a meal choice. Everything is delicious, fresh and tastes homemade!"}
{"text":"Love it. The eggplant parmesan is a worthwhile appetizer, while the seasonal oysters are decently fresh.

Lobster ravioli (also seasonal) was top-notch, as was the cheese tortellini. My friend got the chef's pizza; it was savory and delicious.

A few notes:
-Bread and butter on request (treat yourself... the bread comes hot and butter soft)
-They aren't open for lunch except on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays
-The food is pricier, but generally worth it.
-Good place for a casual date"}
{"text":"Very delicious Italian restaurant! I have been here three times and never disappoints :-) First time I ordered the carbonara and it was extremely delicious and creamy. However, if is a very heavy pasta dish and I was very sleepy afterwards I ordered the Mia Bella pasta the second time and it was very light, refreshing, and yummy. It is a classic spaghetti dish but their marinara sauce was very tomatoey. Even though I prefer pesto and white sauce over red sauce, I really really liked this dish. The third time I got the linguini bolognese and it was again very delicious and hearty. This place is very delicious and would definitely recommend. Only leaving 4 stars because this place is great but not bammmmmm"}
{"text":"Sat on the patio underneath a speaker that was playing Italian music. Their eggplant parm appetizer was TO DIE FOR. 3 most delicate slices of thin fried eggplant covered in perfectly browned mozzarella, but it's their marinara that makes the dish. Holy crap. Next time I go, I'm just gonna order their Mia Bella Pasta!!! The gravy was so good, I packed it up to go!"}
{"text":"One star for the good pasta (although good Italian can be found anywhere): we had the cheese tortellini & pasta verde. 

The kicker here is something that has NEVER happened to me before and that is after an hour and 15 min there, WE WERE TOLD (NOT ASKED) WE HAD TO LEAVE BECAUSE THEY HAD ANOTHER RESERVATION FOR THE TABLE! 

The four of us could not believe it! It also seemed that the table behind us was also told (not asked) to give up their table after their meal. What is shitty about it is we tipped our waitress $20 on $75 (for just our bill) already so I doubt she cared about the table turn, she already got her money! I will never give this place the satisfaction of more business if they are so ruthless of kicking out diners who are just finished eating. I was shocked. 

Shame on you Mia Bella!"}
{"text":"Probably the best Italian meal I have EVER had!!! The tortellini was amazing. A little spicy but the right amount of spicy. Hubby had the Veal which was perfection. It was so soft and delicious. The staff was great and friendly. The whole atmosphere was inviting and casual. Will eat here again on our next trip from Florida hands down!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great place, highly recommended it! Good size, nice atmosphere, great food. A must try calamari.."}
{"text":"Some of the best food in Little Italy! Loved the Mia Bella Chicken dish--my boyfriend had the four cheese tortellini and loved it as well. We had great service on a thursday night despite there being a packed house.  Loved it, will be back."}
{"text":"I love this place. Perfect service always, the people couldn't be more helpful and warm,  and the food is always very very nice. Well conceived and well prepared, attractive presentation and no pretense. A favorite."}
{"text":"Great Food and Excellent service!! Thank you so much Danny!! My mother really enjoyed her birthday dinner.  The grilled sea scallops and lobster ravioli were delicious!!"}
{"text":"This place is my favorite restaurant in all of Cleveland. This hidden gem is in Little Italy and has the best eggplant Parmesan outside of Italy! Definitely a place to go whether you just want to watch the game at the bar or take family out to celebrate a special occasion. Wonderful wine selection, as well."}
{"text":"Started out with the shrimp appetizer, which was absolutely fantastic, full of flavor and cooked perfectly. Also had the calamari appetizer wasn't my favorite but was still good. Main course I had the scampi pasta, which was great, spicy pasta cooked perfectly, shrimp was HUGE and incredible. My friend had the beef bolognese pasta he said it was alright, pasta was cooked correctly but wasn't nothing to excite."}
{"text":"Excellent service!!!!   The food and atmosphere are great too.  Parking is difficult, but worth the trouble.    We stopped here on the way to the Cleveland Clinic.  We'll be back.  Glad we found this place."}
{"text":"Great food and service. Authentic marinara sauce. The Frutti di Mare is excellent, you can order it not spicy, the best I've had."}
{"text":"We stopped in for a light snack and a glass of wine at an outside table on what we figured was the last lovely day of early fall. I had the special salad and my friend had the shrimp saganaki, and we shared a pleasant (but, at $40, overpriced) J. Lohr Chardonnay. The salad, which was described as arugula and figs dressed in black truffle oil, was pleasant enough but inadequately dressed and a little on the skimpy side. The saganaki was excellent though one has to marvel at the excessive amount of sauce in which several lonely shrimp were marooned. The thing that cost Mia Bella a star (above) was the server, who repeatedly referred to us as \"gal pals.\" Perhaps he had confused Mia Bella with Spago. I didn't have the heart to tell him that it was cringe-worthy. At least until now."}
{"text":"Good food. Some of the items are a hit or a miss. But it can be a bit over-priced compared to the quality."}
{"text":"Food was excellent!!!  However if you have to wait for your table don't have a drink here.....the bartender service is very slow.  Have them text you and grab a drink elsewhere.  Mia Bella Pasta was fabulous.....wonderful sauce and the meatballs were perfect.  Nice wine selection....not a lot by glass, so order a bottle."}
{"text":"Took my family of 5 down on a Saturday at 4:30 without reservations.  They were very accommodating and the food and service were exceptional."}
{"text":"My son's hockey team was in town and I chose Mia Bella for a post game meal for the team and their families. I attempted to book a reservation for 50 people on a Saturday at 3 pm but due to no fault of the restaurant, our reservation was not confirmed.

Our arrival of 40 starving players and parents was a surprise to the hostess and the manager, Gerti. Mia Bella is not a large place however, Gerti did not hesitate to get the team and our families seated and served. Our group just about filled the restaurant to capacity.

The food was excellent. I had the lobster ravioli, which was on special, and a glass of Valpolicella. Other people in our group had gnooci, tortellini. In addition, the service was  perfect despite our large group. Everyone raved about their meal and thanked me for selecting such a great restaurant."}
{"text":"One of my very favorites!  I live and work in Dayton, OH but I am seen at Cleveland Clinic.   My favorite thing to do is go to Mia Bella in Little Italy when I leave!"}
{"text":"The food was above average and our service was just as good! Parking was a bit of a hassle in little Italy but worth the walk. It's always pleasant to actually eat in a small quaint place that officers traditional cuisine. Prices were decent, nothing too outrageous. Flavorful food you should give it a try!! I'd go back for sure."}
{"text":"Wow wow wow.   Amazing all around.  Great service. (Thanks Dan).  Lamb meatballs were melt in your mouth awesome. Tortellini was the best.  All the drinks were on point."}
{"text":"Believe the great reviews. Lisa the owner hovers and the service is great. Six meals, all excellent!  Don't miss this place if you want terrific Italian food"}
{"text":"My server micheal just recommended me their cheese tortellini and gee willikers was it the dankist dish I've had in at least a month. Hats off miabella. Great food, great service. Wow. House Pinot Grigio was phenomenal. DANK"}
{"text":"Quaint and authentic cuisine, perfect for date night! Little Italy in Cleveland has a lot to offer, but my favorite pick is Mia Bella. It's a quaint and cozy restaurant that has great service and even better dishes. On my last visit, I had the pasta verde which linguini with a pesto/red sauce. The bread and herb butter that is served at the beginning of your meal is amazing and my fiance and I always order seconds. I've also had the Mia Bella pasta, which is their house specialty - it's pretty good, but a little spicy. Other notable dishes: Lobster ravioli, grilled sea scallops and buffalo mozzarella (app)."}
{"text":"Last night I took my entire family out for dinner and had the most enjoyable time. It was my mom's birthday as well as my aunt who turned 98 and she is from Italy. Mia Bella is one of my favorite places to eat and our meal once again as well as the staff didn't let us down. All of our choices were spot on with flavor and our server was awesome. If you venture out to little Italy in Cleveland I strongly suggest you consider spending some wonderful time here ! Mia Bella......our family thanks you............"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, very beautiful and romantic inside. The food is to die for, was there for the 1st time and wasn't sure what to order, our waiter asked me what I liked and told me  what to order, and I was 100% satisfied with my meal."}
{"text":"Went to Mia Bella for the first time today.  Overall it was very good!  I had the pasta verde dish with shrimp which was really good.  Had to take half of my food home because the portion was so large!  My husband had the special pasta dish with chicken which was really good as well.  Would definitely return."}
{"text":"Called on a Saturday for a same day reservation. Tables for 2 were only available at 4:30 and 9:30 but we were able to reserve 2 bar seats at 6:30. Honestly I think sitting at the bar made our experience even better! A little crowded, a little toasty but well worth the conversations with the staff and other diners. 

We started off with Shrimp Saganaki. We honestly didn't know what it was but it was well recommended. It was amazing! Shrimp and chicken with a sauce that's creamy with a little kick!

One of the main reasons we wanted to try Mia was for all the gluten free options. Anyone that  knows the gluten free \"options\" that most restaurants offer knows how gross they usually are. We were blown away by all the delicious options not to mention the awesome gluten free pasta!! 

We enjoyed a huge portion of tortellini (not gf) in a sauce similar to our appetizer, and the gf penne with sausage.  We only wished we would've saved room for dessert (lots of gf options there too). 

This is one of our new favorite restaurants!!"}
{"text":"Paid a visit for the night and grabbed dinner here before a concert. I called ahead to make a reservation and they were able to accommodate us within 30min of our arrival time. 

We each had a glass of wine. Their chianti was tasty and paired well with my pasta dish. I had the pesto with penne which was a unique preparation from the usual basil pesto. Instead it had a bit of marinara mixed in with a hint of cream. I added sausage to the dish which was a nice addition for a bit of heat. My boyfriend had the gluten free pasta, which is rotini-style pasta with the carbonara sauce. Deliciously cheesy and light enough to finish the whole dish. 

It's a lovely place for date night and the service was quite attentive. We appreciated the friendliness of the waiter who delivered our entrees, saying he doesn't need to eat gluten free but loves that pasta!

Lots of accommodations for gluten free dishes like pizza and pasta. A good spot to try if everyone wants a delicious meal."}
{"text":"I'm not sure if I enjoyed Mia Bella so much because I had just come off the wedding diet and had pasta for the first time or because the food was just so incredibly delicious but I could not get enough of that pasta and the sauce! I went out for dinner with a few friends after work and the weather was perfect for outdoor seating. We had a few mojitos and I enjoyed the penne with prosciutto and chicken. The pasta was cooked well and the sauce was so incredibly creamy and had a mild spice to it. I loved my dish so much I got another one to go so I could bring it to my husband to try! Definitely will be going back soon"}
{"text":"Delicious and the atmosphere is perfect. Great for a special night out or casual dinner. Owner is approachable and humble. Dan at the bar is terrific! Just all around fun and delicious!"}
{"text":"Best Italian food I've ever had. Service was excellent. It's a must if you are in Little Italy."}
{"text":"We sat at the bar Saturday at 4:30 A's this fine restaurant will need reservations .  Bar staff are attentive and friendly as well as authentic Italian.  I'm first generation Italian and we ate pasta every night without exaggeration growing up.  So I can say this is the real deal .

The bread is Authentic Italian with crust and soft Center.  Katie ordered salad with special Beretta (Spell?) mozzarella cheese having soft Center.  Plus her mussels appetizer was superior - it excelled in flavor - spice garlic tomatoes like bouillabaisse   To die for.

Mary ordered eggplant appetizer and she enjoyed it all including red sauce.

My pasta with pesto was not typical pesto as the chef adds a cream which makes it heavier.  The sausage was spicy and that I enjoyed to overrule the bartenders warning.

We'll be back.

I"}
{"text":"Amazing good food!!! Make sure to make a reservation and get in right away! We ordered the fettuccine and the tortellini and had major leftovers!"}
{"text":"My friend and I were in Cleveland for a work conference and we needed a fantastic dinner spot for Saturday night and Mia Bella ranked number #1. We arrived at 5:45 with no reservation and were able to squeeze at the bar. 

Bar service was slightly slow but the place was packed and he seemed aware of our wait and very friendly. We had San Fran Sangria, Cucumber Mint cocktail and a Cosmo, all were tasty but the Sangria was my favorite.

I had a pork belly, mushroom risotto and Ceasers salad for my meal. The pork belly was truly to die for! The risotto was creamy, buttery and delicious! 

Highly recommended but def make reservations if you know your want to eat here on a weekend!"}
{"text":"Was in town for a doctorate graduation and decided to come here post grad. Kelly assisted our large party in seating which made it so easy especially since we had a baby with the party. In addition, every plate we ordered from the cheese tortellini to the lamb kabobs were flavorful and fulfilling. Their customer service was attentive. Overall, I would recommend this place to anyone who is in Cleveland for the first time or anyone looking for a wonderful dining experience."}
{"text":"The photos of the food really can do all of the talking. Mia Bella is a must visit restaurant for me any time I am in Cleveland. The staff is extremely kind and attentive, the food is incredible, and the overall atmosphere is pleasant."}
{"text":"Been here twice. Once with friends, this second time by myself. I asked to start with small side salad which comes with my entree, I was charged separately for it. I ordered the lobster ravioli, only came with four small ravioli's. I asked for a little extra sauce on my ravioli, they charged me $2.95. Also, my ravioli was still gooey & undercooked. An entire meal that cost me $20 last time, cost me almost $40 this time. I'm honestly surprised they didn't charge me for my water as well. It's not about the money it's about the consistency. I definitely won't be going back for a third time."}
{"text":"Better than average red sauce Italian, excellent service, but way overpriced.  There was no wait for an outdoor table on a busy Sunday afternoon.  Two (of the lower-priced) pasta dishes with no drinks or appetizers came to more than forty dollars after tip. We enjoyed our meals, particularly the cheese ravioli, but in that price range I want leftovers or food that is better than \"good.\""}
{"text":"I have been here twice and the food has been wonderful both times. The pizza and cheese ravioli are very impressive. I did not really think the shrimp appetizer was worth it though and the gelato was just okay."}
{"text":"Was in the area and haven't been to little Italy in a while. So many choices to pick from and chose Mia's for the outdoor dining and friendly people. The food was just as good. I had the gnocchi and it was superb.  So many flavors in one dish. Also the sauce that comes with the shrimp appetizer is to die for. Make sure you ask for bread for dipping."}
{"text":"For anyone visiting Cleveland, the Little Italy neighborhood is a must see. The parking is a challenge but they will valet if you don't want to brave the narrow one-way streets and park on a sidewalk in front of someone's house. There are some classic institutions here but Mia Bella is newer. We were seated on a busy Saturday night without a wait. The space is cozy and bustling. Our server was prompt and friendly but I thought it was funny after she described something she kept saying, \"You know what I mean?\" and waving her hands. Wine and beer selection was okay. Warm fresh bread, but you have to ask for it. We started with the calamari appetizer. Sauce was nice and it included zucchini but I found the calamari a bit tough. They did not skimp on the portion though. I ordered the veal piccata, which was alright. It looked a bit sloppy and maybe a bit too much lemon? Came with cavatelli and the sauce was good but not seasoned, pretty plain. My wife ordered the lobster ravioli and that was very good. Nice amount of filling and the bianca sauce was very tasty. I saw the lamb and wish I'd ordered that.  Anyway, it was worth a try but for the money, we'll stick with Osteria in the Warehouse District."}
{"text":"Delicious food.  Decadent desserts.  Fantastic service.  Knowledgeable staff.  Easy to find.  Parking not the best.  The cream based pesto sauce was heavenly.  I would definitely dine here again."}
{"text":"I visited Mia Bella today with my best friend to enjoy a great Italian meal as I heard a lot about this place. Although the food was great, the service was bad. Both me and my friend were left stranded for about 30 mins after our meal for the check. The server ignored and we literally had to call him over for the check. We don't expect much but in a great place as such one should neither compromise on customer service nor discriminate people - He was cold to us while he was very jolly to serve some others."}
{"text":"We loved Mia Bella. Located in Little Italy, this gem will not disappoint. The entree portion sizes were very generous and full of flavor. My only wish is that  we lived closer, because I would be a regular! We tried the Calamari appetizer (highly recommended). I promise you it's not your typical fried squid with cheap marinara sauce on the side (you know, the kind you get at practically every restaurant in America). And if you can, try and save room for dessert. Delizioso!"}
{"text":"The place is clean and good plus they are so accommodating. I ask additional for my order and I instantly entertained then few minutes later our ordered served and we have the great meal the food are so delicious."}
{"text":"This is a great restaurant! They offer lots of gluten free choices and have a lovely wait staff. My family ordered the mussels and calamari before dinner as appetizers (both gluten free) and I was really impressed! I ordered the chicken risotto (also gluten free) and it was good, although the piece of chicken was a little small. This is definitely a Cleveland favorite and I'll be coming back! Also, during the feast of the assumption, they have gluten free options even though they don't advertise them. Yay!!!"}
{"text":"Great ambiance, indoors and out. Friendly, attentive service. The food was delightful~fresh, flavorful and well presented."}
{"text":"If you go to Little Italy in Cleveland you just try Mia Bella! A small traditional little Italian-looking place, but the family's background brings new Mediterranean & Armenian styles to some of their dishes. 

Excellent place for a romantic dinner or a double-date. Lots of great choices of dishes beyond just traditional Italian food. Grab a glass of wine & enjoy!"}
{"text":"My friend and I showed up at around 9:10-15 PM for a table last night (9/22). We asked the hostess if they were still seating. She stared at us rudely, rolled her eyes, checked her phone for the time and finally replied, saying \"uhhhh I guesssss...... I have to set up a table for you tho....\" And walked away. 
We sat down and the server was friendly, but my friend said that the hostess kept glaring at her. 
If you don't want us to sit, then tell us that you are done seating tables for the night. Simple. 
When we had finished eating and gotten up to leave, there were still several tables sitting and waiting for food... So we weren't the last ones there. 
Terrible customer service, mediocre food."}
{"text":"Our favorite spot in Little Italy. Even when we have to wait for a table we know it will be worth it. The calamari is not breaded and has the most amazing white wine broth with peppers and other deliciousness in it -- ideal for dipping their incredible bread in.  We have never had a bad meal so try whatever you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"We were seated right away at the bar which is my preferred spot for dinner. The place was packed, usually a good sign. Drinks were strong... no complaints there. But the food on the other hand left something to be desired. 

My boyfriend order the gnocchi. It was spicy and fresh but after the third bite all you tasted was peppers. I had the veal braciole... the pasta was cold, the braciole was tender and flavor was good. 

All in all, I'd pass. Not a good representation of what Little Italy has to offer."}
{"text":"Great dinner! Our waitress Candace was awesome and the meals were delicious. Our fettuccine carbonara was really good, the steak my friend got looked amazing as well. He really enjoyed it. Making reservations for next week!!"}
{"text":"Romantic and delicious! There's a reason why it's always packed. Best to call ahead and make a reservation. Even for the two of us, it was necessary. 
We started with the Mint Cucumber (mint, cucumbers, cucumber vodka and soda) and Mia Bella Martini (berry vodka, lemonade, fresh berries). Both were good and would be super refreshing in the summer while enjoying a summer evening at their outdoor dining tables. We shared a Caesar salad--they are large portions and easily can be shared between two people. 
For dinner I chose the Veal Braciole with a glass of merlot. Both were delicious paired together and I'd happily order this again, although there are so many dishes o. Their menu is love to try. My husband ordered the Carbonara and it was outstanding! Heavy dish, but delicious. 
Dessert we shared a house made tiramisu. Honestly, go across the street to Presti's -- we have been going to Cleveland's Little Italy for 15 years now and I'd treat myself to Presti's for sure. 
Good service, they were packed and the bar was slammed, but food came out at good timing. Nice to enjoy a non rushed meal sans kids!"}
{"text":"Love the Little Italy area of Cleveland & Mia Bella is a gem. We were welcomed at the door by a charming Italian-American woman. Liked the slightly spicy seafood soup, Caesar salad & thick spaghetti with substantial sauce. Our waitress, Megan, was patient & very helpful."}
{"text":"Came here with my family around 8:30 on a Tuesday night. We called ahead to make a reservation, which was a good idea since it was packed. Service was very good, waiter (Christian?) was attentive and friendly and our waters were frequently refilled (a huge pet peeve is when my empty water glass is left unnoticed). Free Italian bread with herb butter, very fresh and the crust had a slight crisp/crunch, We got the beet salad and pork belly appetizer to share. The beet salad had arugula, walnuts, goat cheese and came with an olive oil dressing, very light and fresh. The roasted pork belly came with crispy potatoes, arugula and currants. The pork belly had a slight char which was very nice, the potatoes were very crispy on the outside, which I loved. Not a huge fan of currants. My parents got the chef's favorite pizza and the house pasta (linguini with marinara). The pizza was good, but really nothing special, I would not come here for pizza. I'm not really into pizzas anyways though. The house pasta was very tasty, the sauce and noodles are fresh and homemade, very solid marinara linguini. My sister had the cheese ravioli in marinara, came with artichoke and it was very good. I got the lobster ravioli, in a tomato cream sauce and I loved it. Very fresh and flavorful, loved the sauce. I would get it again. Serving sizes are pretty good. We were in and out of the restaurant within an hour ish so service was really fast, the food was prepared very quickly, really didn't have to wait around much which was awesome, considering how busy it was."}
{"text":"Been here twice.  Pasta was fresh made either in house or right down the street.  Food has been amazing.  It's on our rotating date night list.  I've also taken my staff here,  they said it was one of the best places they've had in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Just had dinner at Mia Bella this evening after seeing \"Rembrandt in America\".  The Farafella ala Bolognese is really quite good.  The farafelle was cooked just to al dente, the sauce was well flavored with veal and sausage, and fresh herbs.  I had a caesar salad to start and next time I would ask for perhaps bit less dressing, however the fresh shaved parmesean  was generously applied.  I had a glass of the Ruffino Pinot Grigio to complement my meal and was delighted of course.  Definitely will make a return visit to Mia Bella.  Big plus - they have gluten free pasta available and can remove cheese from some dishes to suit vegans."}
{"text":"Had two specials. Soft shelled crab with substituted. gluten free pasta, and halibut with mixed vegetables (substituted for potatoes). Amazing!  Great inviting space, big clean windows, and friendly accommodating server and chef. I'll be back next time I'm in Cleveland."}
{"text":"This is a fantastic Italian place in Little Italy with great service. We had the Albanian salad, veggie risotto and shrimp saganaki to start. The Albanian salad was crisp, fresh and perfectly dressed. The shrimp saganaki was Soo flavorful. Husband got the pasta Verde and I got the Mia bella pasta, we split the eggplant parmesan, everything was Soo delicious and I'm excited to eat all the leftovers tonight  (we definitely ordered too much). We had the canolli for dessert, the presentation and taste were excellent."}
{"text":"Wonderful meal. Had the lobster ravioli which was so flavorful and a lobster was sweet and flavorful. A bottle of reasonably priced wine complimented the dinner. Their bread and seasoned butter was one of the best I've had. Crisp crust and wonderfully seasoned soft butter. Not sure what herb was on that butter, but it was terrific. An appetizer of stuffed HOT peppers was fantastic. They ARE hot but so flavorful. Definitely a must stop. Highly recommend.  We went here based on reviews and they were correct."}
{"text":"Little Italy is a short jaunt (5-10 min drive) east from the Cleveland Clinic.  Treat yourself to this preserved piece of 20th Century America  and excellent authentic Italian food.  Mia Bella gets high marks among your choices here for good reason. As noted in several reviews, the portions are large (large enough to share for two, especially if you get an appetizer, salad or want to save room for dessert).  Outside seating available and recommended if it's a nice night... Enjoy taking it all in."}
{"text":"Stopped in for the Art Walk in Little Italy and we checked out all the menus of the restaurants.  Then we decided on Mia Bella.  The dishes looked so appetizing!  

We ordered some steamed Italian veggies as an appetizer and the free bread was fresh baked, warm, soft on the outside and crispy on the inside.  

I noticed that Cheese Tortellini was an award winning dish, so I ordered it.  Once received, it ended up tasting very spicy, but not enough that I wouldn't order it again.  It was cheesy, creamy, yummy and I loved it!  Totally recommend it!"}
{"text":"Absolutely enjoyed our dinner this evening!! Everything we had was so well presented and on point most importantly so very DELICIOUS! Kudos to The Chef!! I must aladd the restaurant is meticulous with a wonderful vibe! A very special thank you to our waiter Michael M. this evening... he really is a true professional, very well informed with the menu, specials and wine list. Michael truly made our evening a memorable one! We can't wait to visit again soon! 
MIA BELLA IS A GEM of a Restaurant in Little Italy!!!"}
{"text":"We were headed for the La Dolce Vita across the street that we had reserved on Open Table, but the cab driver told us that Mia Bella is the best Italian restaurant in Little Italy. I'm sure he was correct. The food was delicious and the servers were polite and very helpful. Warning: portions are huge. A cup of soup comes in a bowl. Try the veal piccata with veggies instead of pasta."}
{"text":"Food was very good. Everyone enjoyed their dishes. Good service. That's saying alot when my 100% Italian grandfather that came straight from the boat likes it. Would recommend and return."}
{"text":"Took a scenic drive and had lunch in Little Italy for the first time. I had planned on getting something from Presti Bakery based on a recommendation from someone but by the time I got there I was in the mood for something else. We decided to try Mia Bella because they had a nice outdoor seating area and it was beautiful outside. 

We split an eggplant parmesan entree and grabbed a few drinks. The pasta sauce was nice and light and the cheese on the eggplant definitely hit the spot. Overall service was great, every time my water got a little low it was being refilled quietly and deftly without interrupting our conversation, which always makes me happy."}
{"text":"The frutti di mare piccanti was absolutely the best dish I've found so far on the menu. If you are in the mood for seafood but don't want to have to choose just one, you can't go wrong with this dish. The wait staff was super friendly and accommodating too."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant. Food is great and staff is friendly. I enjoyed some delicious meals there and to go several times over the last several weeks while my husband was hospitalized nearby. Everything we tried was fabulous, especially the shrimp appetizer and bread."}
{"text":"This place was nice. We stopped in for a late Saturday night dinner and were seated right away at a table outside. Probably because the sky looked like it was about to open up. Luckily we picked a table under an umbrella. We had a great server who never left us for too long.

The inside looked romantic and cozy but the people watching outside just couldn't be beat on a warm evening.

Food was good. Nothing to write home about, but I'd definitely go back and perhaps try some items that they recommend."}
{"text":"My Niece and her husband raved about Bella and the were spot on! Everything was fantastic. Started with appetizer of Calamari which was tasty and love the fact it was not fried as you will generally find.  I went basic and ordered spaghetti bologonese which was fantastic. Complemented our with a fine bottle of Chianti. Special thanks to Carl our server who did a great job with recommendations and service. I'm from Northern Virginia but will make sure I visit Bella every time I'm here."}
{"text":"Everybody was so friendly! Service was fantastic - very attentive.

I ordered the Cheese Tortellini with meatballs, which was heavy, creamy, and VERY saucy, which is exactly how I like my pasta. The portions are huge! Definitely worth your money. The meatballs were juicy and tender. 

For dessert, we received the flourless chocolate cake, with cannoli's on the side, and it was delicious and beautifully plated. The cake was thick and creamy, while simultaneously also somehow fluffy. Still dreaming about it tbh. 

Will definitely be back! Also love the atmosphere. Dimly lit in a good way."}
{"text":"Super friendly staff and are happy to answer any questions/give recommendations. I had the baked veggies pasta. It was so good! The chorizo sausage was a little spicy if you don't like spice, but it had spinach or some kind of greens, zucchini, bell peppers, tomatoes, chorizo sausage, penne in marinara sauce. Highly recommend this dish and this restaurant in general. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Delicious Italian meals! Went with family several times. Great food & service! Met \"Bella's\" grandma. Love the Shrimp Saganaki -You must try! The sauce is so creamy and delicious! 

Veal Braciole was the best I ever had! Wine list had a great selection- waitress recommended 2 great bottles! 

Must try if in try if in the Little Italy/ Cleveland area!"}
{"text":"Good food.  Great service.  Quaint neighborhood.  Good ambience.

They were very busy on a Thursday night, which suggested to me that they had a good reputation with the locals.  The food was well presented and prepared."}
{"text":"I ate microwaved veal with old asparagus and a quart of Walmart's value marinara sauce"}
{"text":"In the area for a college tour and found this little gem. The shrimp saganaki is crazy good with a sauce that will make your mouth water. We split a margherita pizza which was the perfect size for lunch for two. Priscilla was a fun server who made great recommendations. Will be back next time!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were traveling to Cleveland from Seattle this past weekend when we discovered this gem in little Italy. We came here this past Sunday and had the best lunch/dinner experience we both have ever had (we travel/eat out a ton). Lilijana (Lily) was extremely attentive, helpful and was full of personality. Her knowledge of the menu items is really what sealed the deal for us. She started off by introducing their drink special (Blood and Sand) we went with her recommendation and ordered it, 20/10 rating! Then for an appetizer, she recommended the Shrimp Saganaki, we ordered it and was absolutely blown away by how delicious it was. Lastly, she recommended the award-winning Cheese Tortellini and the Mia Bella Especiale. Let me tell you, they were both so authentic, comforting and so filling that we both had more than enough for lunch next day. We didn't even have to look at the menu because of how tasty Lily made every menu item sound. She is a huge asset to your restaurant and deserves big kudos, the server of the month and a raise. Next time we are back in Cleveland visiting we will surely be back to visit her. Thanks for the experience!"}
{"text":"This is a great place for gluten free pasta! Friendly staff, clean facilities, great food and a reasonable wait time."}
{"text":"We dined al fresco on a warm October evening and had such a lovely date night. It was a busy Saturday night, but we were still seated within about 40 minutes. Host was very nice.

We shared two appetizers- the fresh Buffalo mozzarella plate and the Antipasti. They were very well put together with quality foods. My fiancée was a little confused- 'This cheese isn't spicy at all!'  I had to explain Buffalo did not refer to wing sauce. Guess I have a little refining to do with that one!  ;-)

We shared an entrée- Scampi Pappardelle. The scampi (3 with an order) were huge! They were grilled and had excellent flavor. The pasta was perfect and I loved the freshness of the sauce. The menu said 'spicy', but I didn't taste any kind of heat. Could have used a few pepper flakes in the sauce.

We both really loved our drinks too. He had the Dark and Stormy (also very confused about the giant piece of ginger in the drink. I had to explain to him what it was) and I settled right in with a glass of Valpolicella. The bread was also delicious.

We will certainly be back!"}
{"text":"Great food, good service. It was incredibly loud in there though, but I figure that's typical of a crowded Italian restaurant on a busy night. I'd prefer that this place avoid seating large parties because once one comes in, you can barely hear yourself think, but seriously who would turn away a large party? We had their calamari which was good and prepared differently than I'm used to, sauteed, instead of breaded and fried but still very good. I had the chicken tortellini, it was a huge portion but very fresh. I was so impressed with the pasta, I asked if it was homemade and the waitress said no, honestly, she could have lied and said, oh yeah, hand rolled every day and I would have believed her. The waitress was incredibly knowledgeable of the menu and the chef's specialties. I was very impressed by her. She was very professional. All sauces you can order as no spice, mild, medium, or spicy. Great location in Little Italy and the shuttle for the Doubletree drops you off right in front! Highly recommended by the hotel. Glad we gave it a try! It was a Saturday night and we got right in."}
{"text":"We (2 couples) were visiting Cleveland from out of town, and enjoyed a delicious meal in a bustling, lively atmosphere. The initial wait was going to be an hour and we weren't sure...but thankfully a table opened up when a party of 4 didn't show up for their reservation.  The server was spot on with meal & beer/wine recommendations after listening to us describe our tastes."}
{"text":"The Italian food here was very good and authentic. For example, the sauce I had on my spaghetti was exceptional and had actual chunks of tomato in it (unlike that canned stuff other restaurants serve). But despite the authentic food, the service wasn't all that great.

Service was kinda slow considering that the restaurant was somewhat empty. In addition to that, there was a mix-up in the servers and the staff were unsure as to who was suppose to be helping us."}
{"text":"Decent place in little Italy.  When the town is called \"Little Italy,\" I am expecting Lidia Bastianich or Mario Batali quality and this place falls only a tad short.  I had the fish of the day and it was only slightly overdone.  Overall, the food was average to good (3 stars) and gave me renewed hope in Little Italy after a huge disappointment with Mama Santa's (ewww...*shivers).  

However, seating was a little disorganized.  We had to wait a few minutes at the door with waiters/waitresses walking past us and not even acknowledging us.  Where's the maitre d'?  Maybe because it was a Saturday night and the area was bustling and the restaurant was busy, but at least tell acknowledge our presence and tell us you'll be right with us!  

Street parking gets fairly difficult at night in Little Italy, esp. Friday and Saturday nights, but there's $5 valet parking.

The following has nothing to do with the restaurant rating:
After dinner, we went to Corbo's (Presti's just closed) and had some delicious sfogliatelle and coconut chocolate cake.  It's nice to have a couple a great bakeries around!  But unfortunately, my night was soured by a drunk guy making some extremely racist comments towards me :(  Very disturbing in this day and age."}
{"text":"I used to work here so I have sampled almost everything and it is all amazing! I especially like the veale picatta and the shrimp saganaki. The family is really nice too!"}
{"text":"This is a fabulous Italian Restaurant! Quality of food is excellent! Very attentive staff but not hovering. Our waitress, Tara,excellent! Prices reasonable and bartender serves up excellent drinks!"}
{"text":"We had the sausage and pepper appetizer
Which was spicy and perfectly done and also the eggplant appetizer both were super amazing the sauce they used was freshly made and then we had the pasta entrées everything was beyond expectations 
Service was excellent"}
{"text":"Like any italian restaurant, you're going to have a taste preference of your pasta and your sauce. This place just wasn't a match for me. 

Grabbed lunch and dinner at this place a few times now. The appetizers leave something to be desired as a few taste like they've been reheated ( especially the eggplant). The bread has always been hot and fresh and the butter has an herb finish which is nice.

We stuck to just the pastas on this menu as the pasta is made fresh and we wanted to work through the different offerings. I'm a big carbonara fan, and was not disappointed with the Fettuccine Carbonara. Generous portion and very rich so I ended up taking part home, but it was very flavorful. The ravioli (cheese) were alright. I didn't get a lot of flavor other than basil from the house marinara and it was definitely a watery marinara. The pasta dishes were definitely better than the ravioli dishes as the ravioli were pretty flavorless in my opinion. The tiramisu though was a new take and one we enjoyed. It was not overly sweet and was more creme than sponge which was a really great flavor. 

Again it all comes down to preference of taste with pasta and sauce, for me though, there are better options in little italy."}
{"text":"This is the best Italian Restaurant that I've eaten at outside of Italy!
The food was fantastic! Generous portions! Good wine list!  Incredibly good prices!  
The Tagliatelle Bognese is phenomenal!"}
{"text":"Food: Wonderful! I'm not a Little Italy fan. I find the food \"dead\" and stuck in a by gone era compared to the rest of Cleveland's exciting chef scene. This place was a relief however! The Mediterranean flair on the Italian food really added a fresh aspect to the meal! The flavours were spicy, but not hot for no reason. The portions were large! The dishes also took common and really bland items such as couscous and really took ownership of them. I ordered the Spicy Couscous dish ($16). It had shrimp in it (de-tailed), tomatoes, scallion & carrots. Simple ingredients, but powerful flavour served in a deep dish. My starter was the Zuppa di Pesche. I got a cup for $5.50. The cup was really the size of a standard bowl. It is listed on the menu as being prepared with fresh seafood. My dish came with 2 mussels, a few un-breaded calamari, shrimp and some spices. The soup was mostly broth, but it was such delicious broth it was worth it to soak it up with the bread that was on the table. If I have to find something to be disappointed in I would say it was the bread - it was just plain regular white bread - though it was served hot and with soft flavoured butter. 

Service: Our waitress was very attentive and polite. Service from the kitchen was fast and the waitress was fast on drink refills. The place was completely full, outside as well, but she didn't give off a rushed demeanour. 

Location: It is in Little Italy on Mayfield Hill on the corner of Murray Hill. There is valet for $7. I also really liked that you can text the valet when you are ready for your car and they give you a 5 minute warning text when your car is about ready to show up. You can pay the $7 and tip with credit card via your smartphone. The timing was perfect and the system through MVP Parking worked well. 

Environment: The restaurant is small and was a bit noisy. There are sidewalk tables located in the front of the restaurant. They are in very close proximity to the street though and valet zone, they are right by the door to the restaurant and are literally on the sidewalk so it's not a peaceful spot, but it is outside and for certain isn't boring. I also have to say the chairs inside the restaurant were the most comfortable I remember a restaurant having. 

Overall Recommendation: Go! If you have been disappointed with Little Italy in the past, give this place a try to improve your impression of the area."}
{"text":"Many thanks and much amore to Tara and Yassin! Wonderful dinner, OMG! Compliments to the chef and our servers! The best!"}
{"text":"We had a very nice dinner here. The service was excellent and the food was very good. Our portions were also quite large for the price which two hungry guys appreciated ;) definitely recommend the tortellini. It was delicious!!"}
{"text":"Amazing dinner on a beautiful night! We chose to eat indoors because of some heavy street traffic, but it was lovely. Our waiter was new and had to ask a lot of questions from other staff, but he was so charming and accommodating. We didn't mind. 
I had the tortellini, mussels and bread. My husband had the scallops. We were both in heaven. 
To make up for our wait time, they brought u some conolli- yum! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I went to Mia Bella's the first time recently, and I was very impressed with everything they had to offer. Big slices of warm bread to start. I ordered the scallops with a bunch of different vegetables, and everything seem fresh and it was a good sized portion. Service was attentive and the food was out fairly quickly. At ~$25 for the entree, I won't be going there all the time, but I feel like I got a good value for what I paid."}
{"text":"After taking in the Orchid Mania at the Cleveland Botanical Gardens, we were looking for a nice quiet spot to have an early Sunday dinner. After searching the Yelp app, Mia Bella sounded like the perfect place. And we were not disappointed at all!!

A short drive up Mayfield Rd from the Gardens, this corner road restaurant was perfect! Not crowded but various patrons were enjoying the pleasant surroundings. (A couple sitting behind us happened to be the same couple who asked me to take their picture in front of an Orchid display earlier, so they too picked a great spot.)

After being seated and given both the wine list and menu, we were promptly attended to by our server who gave us the time we needed to review the delights, since this was out first visit. Our pre-meal drinks and fresh bread/butter were delivered as we made out decisions! On a rare occasion we both picked the same dish albeit slightly altered. My wife picked the ravioli, stuffed with cheese, while I altered mine to be veal stuffed.

Both dishes arrived quickly and heated to our liking, hot! (How many times do you order a dish and no matter what the time, it arrives at a temp not to your liking? Won't happen here!) In addition to the stuffed ravioli, the dish also contained fried artichoke! Now you mush know I am not a fan of this item but I now am!! What a delight to the dish. Overall the plates were wonderful and highly recommended.

Since we both skipped breakfast, we indulged in desert! Okay we split it but it was a perfect ending, Bailey Gelato. Two scoops, one for each was a perfect way to end the meal.

If you have not visited Mia Bella all I can say is, \"Get a move on it and get there!\" A true diamond among many on \"The Hill\"!"}
{"text":"RIDICULOUSLY GREAT EVENING - FOOD AND SERVICE.

Had pasta/veggies and salmon entrees. Superb. Sat on the patio/street on a lovely evening. Server was warm and attentive and beyond improvement. Food was fantastic and affordable. Owner (Lisa) stopped over to ask how dinner was. After we both complimented food and service, she gave us a big hug and thanked us for visiting. Nice to feel so welcome, so appreciated, and so well served with great food. (Also went next door to Vino Veritas for a nightcap and had great wine and service, and heard a terrific singer.)"}
{"text":"Amazing food - gnocchi and tortellini is the best I've ever had. Better than Italy! :)"}
{"text":"A truly excellent Italian restaurant.

Attentive staff, delicious meal, and pleasant ambiance; what more could you ask for when going out to dinner.    My wife and I started out with fresh salads, and both had past dishes which were cooked to perfection.  For dessert I ate the most delicious cheesecake.  Prices are very reasonable too.  

Venue is somewhat small, so reservations are strongly recommended."}
{"text":"Located in the heart of Little Italy in Cleveland, this place is a gem.  I have eaten here at least 4 times in the past 6 months and I couldn't be happier that a local friend recommended it.  The service is always terrific, but then again I always ask for Anthula (Ann) because she is so sweet and clearly loves what she does.  The Zuppa de Pesche is so flavorful and hearty and has the most wonderful spicy kick.  The Scampi Papardelle is truly one of my favorites and the shrimp that come on that are always cooked to perfection; again, a little spicy, but perfect.  We have always enjoyed the outdoor seating, but when winter comes we look forward to seeing the atmosphere of the interior.  This place is BUSY, so definitely suggest reservations.  See you soon Mia Bella!!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I recently dined at Mia Bella for dinner! The restaurant is  located in Little Italy and is quaint and cozy! I can't remember our server's name but he was great, offered suggestions and was very welcoming! For appetizers, we ordered the crab bruschetta, I believe it was a special since it's not listed on the menu. We also ordered the shrimp saganaki which was divine! The sauce is so tasty and also perfect for dipping the complementary bread. Our server told us that you can even request this appetizer to be served over pasta. For entrees, I ordered the clams over linguine (seasonal special) and my boyfriend ordered the cheese tortellini. My dish was tasty, but nothing extraordinary. My boyfriend enjoyed the cheese tortellini, very creamy. But his fav was the shrimp appetizer! For desserts, we ordered the cannoli and raspberry gelato cheesecake. Both very delicious as well! We overall had a wonderful experience and will likely be back, prices were also decent and the portions were huge!"}
{"text":"Please go here! Their pasta is amazing and definitely deserving of award. The bread comes with a perfect garlic butter and there are great cheap wine choices. The service was amazing and they didn't even rush us to leave when we were there until closing. I've came before in the summer and the patio is also a lovely experience."}
{"text":"Love the Little Italy area!  Love this restaurant.  Portions are huge, prices are great, service is wonderful.  Will definitely go back next time in Cleveland!"}
{"text":"The bartenders were really nice, although our mixed drinks could have been better. Wine and espresso were perfect. 

We also tried the pizza and it was so, so. The pasta looked amazing so next time we go back we are hoping to try it! I'm giving this place three stars because it was just mediocre on our first visit, but we are hoping to write a great review next time!"}
{"text":"Usually happy here but three of us ordered the scallop special and were disappointed. We were surprised that for a $25 dish that it only had 3 small scallops!"}
{"text":"Delicious, authentic food, caring and kind staff, and intimate and original design. Literally the best Italian food in the Midwest!"}
