{"text":"I feel like not too many people know of this place but it is one of my top 4 places I have to visit once I am back in Akron. I have gone here for 10+ years now and hands down has the best gyro I've ever had. The meat circles the classic gyro cooker and has the right amount of spices. You receive a healthy portion of the gyro meat, fresh ingredients, and a great tzatziki sauce to perfect the sandwich. To make it even better, it is very reasonable in price. Definitely give it a try!"}
{"text":"I stopped in here after passing it for the last couple years, but I always forgot to check it out.  

It's a nice cozy little place with friendly service.  There are a few tables, and a couch that could be from your grandma's basement.  

So I tried the freshly baked Burek with cheese and a gyro jr.  Both were very good, but the Burek was phenomenal.  First time I've ever had it.  Took it home and heated it up in the oven and it was really tasty.  I recommend this place.

My Serbian friend likes this place, and says the Burek isn't as good as the stuff back in Belgrade, but it's still very good.  From a novice, it's fantastic."}
{"text":"Gyro and Strudel Review

**Cash Only**

After reading the latest review posted I decided to stop and give it a try today... I've driven by the sign hundreds of times... pondered the streudel and never managed to stop.

When I walked in it took some time to get noticed... the 2 employees were in the back laughing and talking loudly... when one of them walked by the doorway she came out and took my order (no appology) and stated it would take \"a while\" and I could be seated or walk around... then she flipped the switch on the Gyro spit containing meat and walked back through the door way.

Wait... it wasn't on? Does it have a warmer setting? As soon as my gyro was assembled I paid and went strait to my car and checked... sure enough... it was barely above room temp... ugh... since it was sooo salty and not a spit that had been stacked in house I took the gamble and went home and ate it.

There were a few small bits of tomato and onion... no cucumber... and I tried to find ANY spice / feta / anything in the mayo based \"sauce\"... but there weren't any... just plain mayo.

The pita was HUGE and not stale... that is about the only good thing I can say about it. There was no option to add on Feta... or cucumbers... or anything.

The streudel was ok... not too much dough... not much walnut either... not greasy or buttery... nothing really memorable about it either.

They have breakfast sandwiches and some European groceries... a couple of tables and 2 couches.

Overall someplace my hubby may talk me into going back to since he will see cookies in the pictures... but other than that... not worth the stop."}
