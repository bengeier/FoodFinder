{"text":"Tried Murdoch's for the first time last Friday, droped in for supper about 5pm, I had the steak Sandwich, my wife had the fish & chips. Both were excellent! I also had the broccoli soup, very good if you like broccoli ....
(lots of garlic) Great service, great food. We liked it so much we tried
Murdoch's again Monday morning @ 10:30am for breakfast. Again great food and great service, only one choice for breakfast, eggs, pan fried spuds, toast and your choice bacon or ham. Breakfast was excellent!
We will be back regularly."}
{"text":"If you come to this \"watering hole\" outside the hours of nine to five you will probably get descent service, the only catch is if its eleven on a Friday - the place is deserted. 
Skip this place and just head to Donegals Across the street where there will be more people, similar pricing and you won't feel super awkward trying to talk quietly to your friends."}
{"text":"Their prized competition burger was well below average. It was dry and had a weird acidic flavour. I could only choke down a third of it. I sent it back and ordered wings instead. They charged me for it nonetheless. Their burger came in third last year. I doubt they'll do as well this year."}
{"text":"My favourite local spot to grab a drink a bite.

I can't say enough about how I dislike the faux Irish pub epidemic that has Calgary captivated. What's nice about Murdoch's is that is has it's own identity without trying too hard. It's a pretty unassuming establishment with decent quality food. Although I could live without the VLTs.

Homemade burgers and pizza crusts are a big draw. Wild Rose beer on tap seals the deal for me! Staff is usually pretty friendly as well."}
{"text":"What a disappointment. 35 minutes plus to wait for food. Waitress told us there was only one cook. Not impressed. Hopefully the food is worth the long wait. Got our food and it definitely was not worth the wait. One meal had chicken on it and the chicken didn't taste right. Got it sent back and replaced. My meal was the Ukrainian platter and the cabbage rolls were covered in marinara sauce as opposed to tomato sauce and the Sploumbos sausage was dry and very spicy. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Tried the fish and chips, very average. Very thin skinny fish strips in a thick flour batter, oily

French fries home made but undercooked and very greasy, sitting on a small pool of oil

Service was excellent"}
{"text":"All their food is very delicious and good beer on tap. Pizzas are only so-so. 
Their burgers and salads are great, and most of the appetizers - especially voodoo prawns."}
{"text":"Murdochs is one of my favorite watering holes in Calgary hands down!! Not only is the staff attentive, knowledgeable and friendly but the owner (mike) is a great guy who knows his stuff. They have a pretty standard beer selection with a few European treats as well. The atmosphere is super casual and everybody there seems comfortable and relaxed. 

For being so close to 17th Ave, it doesn't seem like your even in Calgary anymore (which for some is a welcomed escape). With the abundance of TVs and a full subscription to every sports channel there is, this is definitely a place to come with friends and enjoy a pint, pub fare and the game, whatever your game is. 

They pour a PROPER pint of Guinness which, like a great pub in Calgary, is sometimes hard to find.

Cheers and happy dinning!!"}
{"text":"Been there quite a few times since the new owners took over in February. Have had almost every item on the menu and am yet to regret my choice. Service is friendly and efficient. New menu works for me"}
{"text":"Service is good but the food is horrible.  I ordered a burger and yam fries.  The burger was so dry, it tasted like sawdust and crumbled the same way.  There was no mustard on the burger and no mustard in the condiment/cutlery kit on the table so I asked for some and was given a small dish of what looked like possibly dijon mustard and mayonnaise, not regular yellow mustard and had no flavour at all.  Why no regular mustard?  The homemade (whose home I wonder) yam fries were OK, but just OK, and the chipotle mayo served alongside was a greasy disaster with zero flavour.  It was actually separated with some kind of oil floating on the top.  

This is my second visit to Murdoch's.  The first time it was a busy evening and I wrote off the bad experience to an overworked kitchen and staff but this time the place had only one other table with patrons so there was no excuse.  One of the worst meals I've had in Calgary and if anyone ever suggests this greasy spoon again I will refuse."}
{"text":"cheap pool and drink specials, can't go wrong for a block from my place"}
