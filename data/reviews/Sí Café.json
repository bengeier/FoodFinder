{"text":"Definitely the BEST coffee in Madison. You will not find a beverage more carefully crafted. Also you can sip espresso, while playing free pacman, surrounded by a bunch of men that look straight out of the movie Newsies?? Yes please!!"}
{"text":"Great Coffee! Comfortable, Cool atmosphere and great guitar music on Saturday mornings."}
{"text":"Best coffee I've ever had. Worth moving to Madison for. Lucky for me they sell beans on-line."}
{"text":"Excellent place. Menu is (currently) limited to pour over coffee and traditional espresso drinks, which is pretty much all you need. Drinks are prepared carefully and with skill. Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for great coffee on the square."}
{"text":"Saw the chalkboard sign for s smoked rosemary cortado. I expected craft with that kind of title and I wasn't disappointed! Barista (wish I could remember her name) had great/welcoming energy. The shop itself holds a unique character with it being a barber shop. Will return!"}
{"text":"This place exceptional. Amazing coffee, totally great people.  Sure, a bit intimidating because it is so completely hip, and I will never be as cool as the people working there, but the coffee is exceptional, and the people - on both sides of the counter - are awesome"}
{"text":"Was lured in by gentle strummings of an acoustic guitar and signboard promising vegan-friendly practices.  I'm on a no-caffeine (or light caffeine) kick right now and have reservations about decaf coffee.  Luckily, the genuine and charismatic owner/barista Tony stepped in to ease my mind with description of the non-solvent process used in production of Si's decaffeinated coffees.  He produced a lovely pour-over which I enjoyed with a generous slice of flavorful vegetarian quiche--the only non-vegan item in the cafe... all while french guitar music played in the background."}
{"text":"Not sure what to expect in a coffee bar....this was a surprise! A functioning barbershop with the coffee. We didn't stay and experience different beverages but ordered lattes to go.   Artistically beautiful and the best latte ever. And I have had a long relationship with lattes!  Would walk here for a coffee every day!"}
{"text":"I've been sitting on this review forever because I've been truly stumped how to rate it. It's a small counter area inside the same space as Ritual Barbers. The design of the entire place (barber included) is beautiful and doesn't look a whole lot like anything else in Madison. Everyone in the space is much cooler than I'll ever be, but there's no pretension and interactions with staff on both sides have been friendly. Coast vibes appearance, Midwest heart.   I came to Sí for a meeting; the person I was meeting with had never been and was curious to check it out. When we arrived we found that the menu was extremely limited. Fine for my friend, but I can't have caffeine and thus was left to tap water. No knock on the cafe for this; they have a small menu that they seem to do impeccably and it's not their responsibility to cater to those of us who aren't allowed to enjoy caffeinated beverages. I just felt a little like a jerk not ordering anything and left a dollar tip on my water. They do have some vegan pastries but that weren't ringing my bell that day (and trying to eat while conducting a meeting is a pain, anyway).   Speaking of talking - I don't know if it's encouraged. There was a bit of chatter on the barber side, but no patrons at the counter nor the barista were engaged in conversation. I was getting some looks from other patrons and generally felt uncomfortable during the entire meeting because we were the only ones making noise and I'm pretty sure every word of conversation could be heard by anyone who cared to listen. Again, not a fault of Sí's  - I've only been the once and it might be a quiet, mind-your-own-business sort of place. No one employed by the cafe or the barber hindered our convo or asked us to pipe down or anything so the discomfort was all my own/from other customers riding solo.  So, how to rate it? I ultimately landed on four stars because it drives me nuts when people low-ball a place not because of what it is, but because of what they want it to be. I do love the vibe and would love to spend an afternoon with a book, especially if the seating area further back is up for grabs for cafe patrons. I also have to take into account that, for me, a human who is barred from caffeine and tends to get chatty with whomever I'm with, this probably isn't going to be my number one choice."}
{"text":"This bar looks cool, but the drinks are expensive and so ridiculously disgusting. I tried to order a gin and tonic, but they don't have tonic. Okay, so I ordered a manhattan. It was terrible. Don't come here. There are way better bars in Madison"}
{"text":"A very cool coffee place. Limited space for working on your laptop, but you get great espresso :)"}
{"text":"Best coffee in Madison. Drinks are super consistent -- everything weighed and measured. Love their roast... Always found Bradbury a bit too fruity. This is nuttier and complex. And they're always happy to talk to people about roastery and the origin of the beans."}
