{"text":"Nitty Gritty is one of those classic college bars full of students celebrating the weekend. Make sure to stop by on your birthday to pick up a souvenir birthday mug and complimentary beer or beverage! Although it was pretty crowded and loud, they offer great drink specials on weekends."}
{"text":"Love the food. Birthdays rock at the Gritty. Met some awesome other people who share my special day. And they were all different ages. great to party with the older crowd! Burgers are big, juicy and have great toppings. I'll go back even if it's not my birthday."}
{"text":"Good burgers and good service makes this a popular choice for everyone.  Had the big grit and was satisfied.  Waffle fries plentiful and delicious.  Reasonable prices and fast service makes me want to visit this place again."}
{"text":"It's a birthday bar.  If it is not your birthday (or your friends b-day) I would avoid.  Too many families and kids."}
{"text":"From http://www.thegritty.com/birthdaycelebrations: Rule #1: Your birthday is defined as 11AM-12 Midnight on the day of your birthday. Bring an I.D. (driver's license). If you are a child bring a trustworthy parent or grandparent. Rule #2: Drink free soda, specialty birthday cocktails or beer on your birthday and keep the \"memento\" mug. For those last minute gifts, buy yourself or a friend a Gritty t-shirt, a birthday cake, a Gritty sparkler or a Gritty glo-lite birthday button!  This is absolutely NOT true. I visited the Nitty briefly in the early afternoon of my birthday to buy a drink and was told that they're policy is to provide free drinks on your birthday. At first it sounded too good to be true. But sure enough I got a free beer, which was all I wanted to drink at the time.  However, I assumed after looking up these rules that I could return in the evening since it was still my birthday. However, I was informed that after you leave the Nitty, that is treated as the end of your birthday. So beware, free beer is only offered during a single visit. If you decide to come back later, you're SOL.  Thanks to the management for making me PAY for my birthday beer at the so-called \"birthday place\". I will not be returning and would suggest the same for any friend who's birthday I want to celebrate the right way."}
{"text":"Waited a long time to get served at the bar despite standing with a birthday balloon. We then stood around like lemons waiting to be shown to a table. Finally sat where we felt like. After waiting 15 minutes for someone to come and take an order we went and tracked down a waiter. To be fair to him, once he started looking after us he was very attentive. Food is OK, birthday drinks are a little limited to anything nice. Cocktails are OK. An OK place to start the night for a few drinks for a birthday but not one to set up camp in."}
{"text":"I went once when I moved my daughter into the dorms and ordered a hamburger that was delicious! Last Friday night I went back and ordered a chicken sandwich and fries, there were hot fries with and tepid ones mixed in. The chicken was dry and barely warm. I think they should be ashamed of what they put in front of me - standards people. I should have sent it back but we were all exhausted and STARVING.  McDonald's buttermilk chicken sandwich meal (my elderly Mom loves to go there) has this beat."}
{"text":"The nitty has good food and is great for birthdays, but it's not exceptional. The food is overpriced, and they charge 18% gratuity on every check, which is fine as long as you're getting great service. Like I said its awesome for birthdays (free drinks) but it's more of a tradition than a choice.  I do have to add the gritty sauce is AMAZING and extremely addictive."}
{"text":"This was my first time in a Birthday Bar! I think that it is a great concept and it was very nice to see so many people celebrating their Bdays at the same time. They give away a bday balloon and a day mug plus you get your name on bday board. The drinks we ordered were blah, but when we were there barcardi was giving away drinks plus the bar gave shots to people celebrating their bday. I wish I have one of this around for my next bday"}
{"text":"The falafel burger was delicious! This is THE place in Madison to go for a birthday dinner. It's pretty cheap, the bar is good, and the food is dependably delicious."}
{"text":"Last year was my first year living in Madison and I avoided this place on my birthday due to the reviews. Being in my late 20's, I thought it'd be too young for me and our group (parents were attending). After spending more time in Madison, I heard so many people recommend it, if not just to say you did it, so I decided to enjoy a birthday meal here.   All in all, I really can't say I was disappointed. They were easily able to accommodate a table of seven on a Saturday night (we waited for about five-10 minutes). The staff seemed exhausted (Badger game earlier that day) but still polite (even if our waiter got multiple things wrong). The free beer was a selection of any of their (roughly 20?) taps, which made me happy. The crowd wasn't obnoxious -- a bit loud at times, but that was to be expected. And the food wasn't horrible -- I was able to upgrade the beef in my burger to a higher quality (listed on the menu) and the pretzel roll it was served on was fabulous. The fries and cheese curds, though I'm sure they're from a food distributor, were still really good. Yes, predominately bar food, but they had options and kicked it up a few notches quality wise. Of course there are better/more unique places in Madison, but that isn't always the reason you go out.   We left after dinner, so I don't know anything about the bar/late crowd."}
{"text":"I am a graduate student at University of Wisconsin-Madison (well over 21 years old), but I am originally from Maryland. Immediately upon entering the Nitty Gritty the bouncer told me \"not tonight\" and asked me to leave the bar. Considering that I am well over 21, it didn't even occur to me that the bouncer thought my ID was fake. So, I asked him why he was asking me to leave. He rolled his eyes at me and asked to see my Wisconsin student ID. I gave him my student ID and he proceeded to put my 100% real, state-issed drivers license in his pocket and asked me to leave. I guess he thought he was being clever, \"If she gives me a Wisconsin student ID then she must be an undergraduate and cannot be as old as her ID indicates. It therefore must be fake!\" I guess he conveniently forgot that UW is a huge university with numerous post-graduate programs. I basically had to pull a huge fit to get my drivers license back so I wouldn't have to go through the huge pain in the butt hassle of calling the police and having them get my ID back for me. This bouncer did not ask for any other forms of ID to verify that my license was real (I had to offer him my credit card and undergraduate student ID myself). He did not bend my ID or do any of the usual tricks to realize that it was not a fake. Instead he was just extremely rude to me and attempted to take away my very real and authentic ID. I am never going back to the Nitty Gritty. They need to hire new bouncers who are intelligent enough to know how to do their job and know the difference between a real ID and a fake ID."}
{"text":"I'm a sucker for nostalgia. That's why I  make sure to hit the Nitty on every visit to Madtown. I celebrated many a birthday here as a Badger and have definitely indulged my fair share of Power Hours. Like many of Madison's eateries, the Nitty has a vast tap selection with an emphasis on local breweries like Ale Asylum and New Glarus. If you're a beer fan--and if you're reading this in WI, you probably are--you gotta go.  While many come here just for power hour, the eats are really as good as it gets in terms of pub food. The deep fried cheese curds are always a hit, and even the nachos are stellar. Oh, and while many would be quick to disagree with me, I think the Nitty might do the best burgers in Madison. Better than Dottie's, Brickhouse, or even The Old Fashioned. The Nitty's burgers are always juicy, and there are maybe twenty of them to choose from. My personal favorite is the Pretzel Bender, which comes topped with a godly slice of Wisconsin cheddar, homemade pretzel mustard, and a massive onion ring. Whatever burger you get though, make sure to get a side of Nitty Sauce with it. It's essentially a creamier, fattier Thousand Island. So bad for you..but so good.  A trip to Madison isn't complete without a stop at the Nitty Gritty. Eating there will make you feel like you're in college all over again."}
{"text":"I was dragged here for someone's birthday.  The place was empty save for us and one other group, but the music was cranked to about a jillion decibels despite the fact that no one was dancing.  Crappy beer selection, mediocre food, decent people-watching I guess (which is good, because it's impossible to have a conversation here, even if everyone you're with likes yelling).  My few hours here was probably the most bored I've ever been while drinking alcohol."}
{"text":"I'm happy to see people consistently rating this 2-3 stars because the food is standard pub food--nothing exceptional. When I had first moved to Madison for some reason we ate here all the time (Current Tally of Birthday mugs: 5). I say the only reason to eat here is for a friends birthday (if they want a mug).  Though it isn't a bad place to eat before or after a Badger game though it is pretty busy at those times--I'd more identify this as a classic place to get a beer when you are in your Badger gear, they always have the good/standard Wisconsin Craft Beers.   And a happy note for those who have the full collection of colored birthday mugs--They upgraded their birthday mugs to something a little more classy. So come on down!"}
{"text":"In Madison on Business trip; walked from Hotel for dinner and Pint.  Great beer selection; I enjoyed Lake Louie Warped Speed Scotch Ale and apple and   Garganzola salad.  It's a little noisy but there was a soccer game on.  Only bad thing is my Birthday is next week, so no free beer for me tonight."}
{"text":"I will never go back to this bar. The service is absolutely terrible and the waitstaff is rude. I waited 20 minutes at the bar for a drink and asked someone behind the bar \"May I please have a rum and coke?\" The answer? \"I'm not a bartender.\" and they walked away. I wait longer and ask another member of their staff \"Are you a bartender?\" and their reply was \"Ya, but I'm busy\" and  again they walked away. Not \"I'll be right with you\" or \"Just a sec\" but ..\"I'm busy.\" By then I no longer wanted a drink- I just wanted to close out my tab. I finally got the attention of a male bartender, told him how rude the other two staff had been, and he rolled his eyes and proceeded to serve 3 people before running my credit card. I was a bartender for a long while before I got my degree, so I know that being rude to customers is incredibly stupid. THAT IS WHERE YOUR INCOME COMES FROM. I mean seriously, how hard is it to get money out of drunk people? Its sooo easy! All you have to do is smile and treat people courteously. The only gratuity I gave those bartenders that night was a note to go \"go F*$k yourselves\" on the tip line of the credit card receipt. Don't waste your time or money at this place, there are PLENTY of other wonderful places to get a drink and party in downtown Madison."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times, buts its never my choice and I hesitate to go here.   Food - One of the worst values I have ever experienced in a restaurant. It is pretty bad and way over priced. I was ordered an Italian sandwich thing and veggies for 10ish dollars...I got a 4 inch sub and a cup of bag steamed veggies. Seriously? I could get a better/bigger 6 inch sub at subway for 4 dollars.   I went here one day during Spring break for the bar. Left in two minutes. The only people in the place were creepy 23-25 year old guys with their guts overflowing and tatted up."}
{"text":"I went here with a friend while visiting Madison. Their burgers look great online and in ads. I thought they were just OK. I wasn't impressed. It wasn't bad but not all that great either. Culver's has a better burger if you ask me."}
{"text":"I will only go back for a friend's birthday, if it's the only venue at which I can join them.    Worst.  Nachos.  Ever.  Stale, apparently covered with Velveeta, with black olives sprinkled as an afterthought.  Whoever assembled ours didn't know the distinction between jalapenos and peperoncini.  The \"homemade salsa\" wasn't even \"Wisconsin spicy\".  The burgers are OK, but there are much better venues.  Dotty's is half a block away and has much better food.  If you must go, rest assured that they have a decent craft beer selection."}
{"text":"While in WI for a wedding we had occasion to stop in and grab a bite.  And it was a very good thing we did. The food was great, and the service even better.  Now, I am not a big fan of the overt birthday celebration, or the scores of waitstaff singing off key...but here, it was pretty nice to hear them do it for various patrons.  So yes, if in town on my birthday I wouldn't mind them singing for me."}
{"text":"Lustiger Laden! Es gibt hier viele Biersorten und die Partystimmung ist auf jeden Fall der Hammer. Alle Geburtstagskinder kriegen den ganzen Abend Bier umsonst.  Von 22:00  23:00 ist Power Hour und dann ist in dem Laden die Hölle los. Der Platz ist auf jeden Fall einen Besuch wert!"}
{"text":"As far as college students go, this is the place to be for birthdays and pregaming. For birthdays, you get all-you-can-drink free beer, mug, a tiny sundae and a balloon. My friends and I all love the cheese curds with gritty sauce and the gritty burgers. Power hour (every night from 10-11pm) has $1 mixers and is the best bar to begin drinking at."}
{"text":"I ordered the Gritty burger and it was really good, the gritty sauce adds a good flavor. Dipped my fries in the gritty sauce as well which I highly recommend. Service was quick but be sure you get there early. We got there at 5 and by the time we left at 6, there was a big line to get tables."}
{"text":"One of the most over-rated establishments in Madison.  For starters, the food (burgers?) is totally mediocre.  You'd think that they would have some unique offerings, but unlike other restaurant/bars (Dotty's Dumpling Dowry right down the street) the Nitty Gritty has only the most run-of-the-mill selections.    The crowd is as touristy as it gets in Madison.  There is not a single night when the bar is not predominantly occupied by college sports loving parents and their obnoxious college-aged frat guy or sorority girl type children.  Even on days when there are no sports events (rare) the nitty gritty attracts only the boring and brain-dead.  One of the only redeeming features of the Nitty Gritty is the nightly power hour - 1 dollar highballs (although they are comprised of more water than booze).  After as little as $10 you may even find yourself having a good time here.  Three stars because it is indeed one of the the best places to go on your birthday.  An endless mug of free beer for you (and your friends) is hard to beat."}
{"text":"Went here before hockey game. Got in at right time  before crowd.  Decided to try the Roasted Garlic Burger  and loved it. Cooked perfectly, fresh roll and great flavors. Would recommend this without a doubt.   Wife had Marks Buffalo chicken sandwich and snicker milkshake. Everything was perfect with great flavors.   Service and staff were very good. No issues with them at all.  If you ate looking for a good place for a quick meal that I think you will love then definitely try the Nitty Gritty."}
{"text":"Good only for going on your birthday--if you don't mind crappy food and only want free (diluted?) beer. The burgers weren't good and I couldn't even finish it drunk. The birthday guy (whom I leeched the beer off of) enjoyed his time here, but personally I wouldn't celebrate my birthday here.  Go if you will get free beer off your friend's birthday, but otherwise don't."}
{"text":"The Nitty Gritty is definitely one of the places to go if you want to enjoy a good meal and have some fun.   Their food, especially their appetizers, are super good.  I'm a huge fan of the cheese curds.  The nacho plate is GINORMOUS.  The onion rings have a good batter to onion ratio, and their wings are super flavorful.   I haven't had their burgers recently, but the last time I did, it was quite memorable.  The sauce was delicious, and the ingredients were good quality.  My favorite part about the Nitty is the dart board.  I always have a good time playing darts with my friends here.  For 4 people, it's $3 for a game, which is pretty reasonable at $1 per person."}
{"text":"This place i am giving 4 stars. It isn't the most wonderful place in the world but it is a Madison classic. It is always great to go there and get your birthday glass and baloon and drink free beer all night. Of course they give you some other drinks free but thats also why your friends are there too. The food is cheap with huge portions and it is always delicious and prepared well. It isn't a place to go all the time to hang out at but happy hour and $1 drinks on tuesday nights is a pretty good deal so ill still give this madison favorite 4 stars.  (after 10:00PM for the $1 drinks)"}
{"text":"I've gone to the Gritty on my birthday every year since I turned 21.  It's become a bit of a tradition that I meet up with my parents and grandmother for lunch or dinner, and this year was no different.  I enjoy coming here on my birthday to get my free beer & mug, but other than this and friends' birthdays I can't really say that I would regularly visit.  The meals are usually pretty good.  I get the Grittyburger every year on my birthday - as others have said, it's not my favorite burger in Madison but it's not a disappointment.  This year mine was slightly dry, but this is due to me ordering it done medium well.  Regardless, I enjoyed it like always.  My parents didn't enjoy their food as much.  My mother said the caesar salad was watery, and both she and my father also thought their Spotted Cows tasted a bit off.  Even so, we had a great time overall for my birthday.  I always feel a bit awkward when the servers come out and sing \"Happy Birthday\" but I suppose if they don't mind I really shouldn't.  For the most part the service is great.  I've always appreciated the bartenders here in that they're always quick and efficient.  The waitstaff are usually very attentive and pleasant, and I can't think of too many unfavorable experiences myself.  When I've come for others' birthdays I've had more varied experiences.  I generally try something different on the menu.  Last time I had the teriyaki chicken sandwich - very good.  The appetizers are along the standard line of cheese curds and other fried food, and the spinach dip is pretty good too.  However, when I've just met up for drinks it can get a bit boring.  The atmosphere can come off a bit forced, and it can get a bit too loud.  The birthday song they play is close to the most annoying song ever.  It's guaranteed to get stuck in your head for days afterwards.  Overall the Gritty is the kind of place that most everyone can agree on, which makes it great for getting people together on a birthday.  I would recommend skipping when there's a home game at the Kohl Center, because the Gritty has a truncated Game Day menu like many other places in the vicinity.  But on any other night the Gritty serves as a pretty decent place to get your birthday celebration started."}
{"text":"The Nitty Gritty is THE go to birthday place in Madison. You get a mug & a balloon on your birthday (you need your ID to prove it) and it comes with unlimited free soda, birthday cocktails, or tap beer and you get to keep the mug. That being said, you do have to go up to the bar for the refills - they want to make sure you can still stand up to get your beer! You also get the world's smallest chocolate sundae. They also have a great power hour from 10-11pm (or whenever they play the final countdown - get there early, there is always a line) where you get $1 high life taps, $1.50 rail mixers, and $2.50 bomb shots.   Aside from all that, I love the food too. They have lots of seating and decent brunch, so it's a nice backup option if you can't get into the swanky other option you were hoping for. Their dinner is my favorite though - 2 different kinds of cheese curds and awesome burgers. You can't go wrong with the classic Gritty Burger (their gritty sauce is to die for) but they have a lot of unique and fun combinations as well as daily burger specials. A Madison staple!"}
{"text":"Love coming here for my birthday! It's pretty awesome! I enjoy ordering my drinks from the special Birthday area! We had a waitress and she was amazing! Happy hour is awesome, you can get 1/2 priced rail drinks with your birthday mug so... for the non-beer drinkers. There's a tip for you! I got you covered! They also announce your name throughout the night to represent for the birthday folks! This is a great starter place for an awesome birthday night! Bathroom is pretty clean as well! Also, if it's after 10pm and there's a long line, try to hold off on that cigarette if you smoke (I don't smoke but my friends do) or you'll end up at the back of the line when coming back inside!!!"}
{"text":"I was very disappointed with my brunch experience at the Nitty. I ordered the cheese curd burrito and it had zero cheese curds in it. The eggs were terrible and you couldn't pay me to eat the breakfast potatoes. Their special \"gritty\" sauce may be the most disgusting thing ever, it was created by a truly disturbed person how wanted to inflict pain on someone.Their bloody marys taste like cheap watered down tomato juice and have no flavour. The food also takes an obnoxiously long time to come out. If you like horrible food and long wait times this place is for you!"}
{"text":"Great service, AMAZING burger (big grit) very reasonable. Good music, good vibe and very friendly. Can't ask for much more from a restaurant."}
{"text":"If you like TGI Fridays, you'll love Nitty Grittys. The story on the back of the menu made me a little bit sad - how they went from counterculture to birthday restaurant. But the Cole slaw was good and the sourdough bread for the patty melt was really good. Good lunch service."}
{"text":"The staff was helpful and friendly. The food came 10 min after ordering. Burgers were fine but cold, french fries were cold as well. We returned cheese nachos as they were terribly cold. The waitress apologized several times and took it off the bill. Mediocre food in a friendly atmosphere."}
{"text":"Came with a group of 9, service was quite slow and waitress was very slow on the drink refills. After over 30 minutes after ordering food, I had to inquire on the status of our meal. This was after 1 pm and it was not very busy. Shortly after the food came out. Food had obviously been sitting for awhile as the burgers and fries were roughly room temperature. Sent one of them back and the new one came out which was much better, and it only took about 5 minutes. Waitress again seemingly forgot about us so I had to grab her to give her my credit card. Upon getting the bill, we were charged full menu price vs the $10 lunch special for burgers, fries and drink. Since we were here now for well over an hour already and had to leave, it wasn't worth the battle. Pretty poor experience and I likely won't be back."}
{"text":"Average burgers, big menu, loud. As one person who walked by me commented, \"Definitely a college bar\". The place appears to be popular for birthdays. We went as a large group of around 13 people and were served by two waitresses however we waited for over 45 minutes for our meals and they still forgot one of our orders. But they managed to get the order out in 5 minutes at the most which makes me wonder why our orders took so long, especially since half the group was served before the other. It's an okay place with a good price on their food but nothing special so I probably won't be back again."}
{"text":"It was before a Saturday night Badger Hockey game, and the place was crowded. We had a group of 4 but didn't have to wait too long for a table. The service was pretty good, but my wife ordered a prime rib steak sandwich. What she got was some kind of shaved beef that she equated with a Steak-ums pre-packaged sandwich. For $11, you would think you might get a little better quality of meat that is billed as prime rib."}
{"text":"\"Madison has some of the tastiest burgers that I've ever had. This is a really fun burger house where they serve up delicious charbroiled beef burgers with an awesomely memorable secret sauce.\""}
{"text":"I feel so bad for writing a negative review on such a Madison classic but I was pretty let down. I went on my birthday and got free drinks as a result, but that was probably the only positive. Our waitress kept messing up our drink order which was annoying and. I know they supposedly have great burgers but I wasn't entirely impressed. I think you can get a better burger at dotty's. It was around $40 for the three of us so not bad considering we got An appetizer + one burger each. I would only really recommend this place for drinking + watching a game since their alcohol selection was impressive."}
{"text":"The medium-well cheddar burger here at times edges out Dotty Dumplings Dowry, but at other moments loses, since depending on the night, it is missing a charbroiled flavor and lacks freshness.   Granted, the fries are a bit bland and require you to pepper and salt the heck out of them. Nitty Gritty's breaded mushrooms also lack oomph, but honestly, as an \"appetizer,\" they are big enough for an entire meal!  Major bonus points for their cornmeal encrusted chicken strips which will not leave your hands coated with grease at all. Nitty Gritty's special sauce, a combination of ketchup and mayonaise, works for them.   Their honey weiss beer offsets the good food nicely. Clean wood interior with plenty of seating that does not look as old as it is. I see Wisconsin alumni here with their families, which shows that this is not a place you really roll your eyes at after undergrad.  As for the birthday deal? Although I sometimes like to make fun of the faux enthusiasm the employee behind the bar has to muster up to announce the names, one cannot argue that it's nice to be recognized on your special day - even though it is plenty cheesy. Yes, the song should be nixed completely.  I also like that they play 80s songs here, but their volume is juuuust right so you do not have to shout or strain to hear your friends."}
{"text":"I went to the sun prairie Nitty Gritty. The service was slow, the order was wrong, the waitress did not come back after dropping off the bad food and no one from management could care less"}
{"text":"Hate to start off on a bad note, so I'll start with the good.  I had the Big Gritty.  It was certainly big.  The burgers were pretty well done overall, the waffle fries were awesome.  The rest...The grilled cheese was completely dried out like it'd been sitting under a heat lamp for 20 minutes, the bun for the burger was totally dry and tasteless, the cheese curds were cold hard and too greasy, the butternut soup tasted like over sweetened baby food.  It took 45 minutes from the time we ordered to get the food.    I'd say that will be my last visit."}
{"text":"So, I'm in my early thirties but am clinging to my late twenties. I'm here from out of town and stroll in at 11:45 on a Wednesday looking for food. The music is late 90s / early 2000's, and the bar is moderately packed with twenty and thirty somethings.   I approach the giant bar and pick a spot with great tv and people watching views. The bouncer chases me down and asks for my ID. I chuckle and hand it to him. But, man did that feel good.   The bartenders (three) are super attentive. The guy that mainly serves me--Ben--gives me amazing local beer samples based on my stated tastes. Then, he gives me great menu suggestions. While I'm ordering, a guy approaches the bar to order 9 (yes, nine) shots. A girl comes up and tells him a friend of hers \"looooves\" him because the friend likes \"seasoned\" guys. I die laughing. She starts hitting on me. Ben saves me. Whew.   I order a Sunrise Burger that basically comes out in seconds. It's amazing, except that the bun is a bit stale. Everything else is delicious. The side of Wisconsin cheddar cheese curds that I ordered based on Ben's recommendation is so amazing that I get a second. I proceed to calculate the number of miles I'll need to run tomorrow to undo this. Totally worth it. So. Good.   Someone is singing happy birthday in the most obnoxious way- for the second time. Apparently, this is well known as, \"the birthday place.\"  Sure. I miss my twenties and now resent my birthdays But, not in this place.  Now, if you'll excuse me, I need to sing along to the Backstreet Boys..."}
{"text":"While in Madison for work, I asked where I can find a great hamburger. The Nitty Gritty was one of those places. Well the Gritty burger was fantastic!!!  The atmosphere was lively and entertaining and it is the birthday capital of Madison. The service was quick, friendly and attentive. Really good experience. When I'm back in Madison, I will definitely visit again!!!!"}
{"text":"Man, I really don't like giving bad reviews but I couldn't finish my burger so... Ordered delivery- no utensils for my salad, croutons were totally stale, no extra sauce that I had ordered. Had one of the vegetarian burgers and it totally fell apart, but that wouldn't have mattered to me. What really bummed me out was the bleu cheese I didn't order on it. I personally can't stand bleu so it made the burger inedible. I ate around what I could and ended up chucking over half away. It took a long time to get to us, so it was a bit of a disappointing end to that wait. Seems like a super busy place so maybe it was just a mix-up, but I don't think I'd give it a second chance."}
{"text":"I do not understand the hype over the Nitty Gritty. This place is honestly one of the lousiest bars AND one of the lousiest restaurants on campus. They just have a brilliant marketing scheme going for them, which associates the Nitty with birthdays and everything UW. The burgers here are mediocre at best, but usually err more on the side of diarrhea-inducing. They're steeped in enough grease to give even the toughest fat man a stomachache, and the meat is reminiscent of a McDonald's Big and Nasty.   Going here for a drink is usually a complete shitshow; it gets so crowded and loud in here that you can't have a conversation with someone sitting across the table from you, or make a trip to the bathroom without weaving in and out of people like a fucked-up roomba. The people aren't too bad, but if as-college-as-it-gets isn't your thing, you'll feel out of place. However, there is a slightly lower proportion of frat boys here than your average campus bar."}
{"text":"Left nitty gritty to get tobacco. Waitress's suggestion. Came back, bouncer wouldn't let me in, despite large open credit card tab. In the process of denying me admittance, bouncer grabbed and held my credit card, and refused to give it back. It was the short white guy on duty 4/4/15... MIKEY . I had to grab my credit card back from him. So odd.  Not just insulting, but really inexcusable.  Anywhere else in Madison is my suggestion. Literally anywhere. It could be a rat mucus pile... I would recommend it over nitty gritty. Would be friendlier and smell less like skunk. Great waitresses though. Really nice folk. If only the door people weren't crab people.  Edit: I have quit tobacco, but still wouldn't recommend nitty gritty unless you are underage and looking to try out your new fake id."}
{"text":"Do you ever get an irresistible urge to scream out to an entire bar, \"shots for everyone\"?   Well, during the Nitty Gritty's $1.25 power hour special, you can fulfill those stupid urges of yours, without breaking the bank.    But then again, I got trashed off $20 worth of booze, so I might not be the best person to consult with about dumb urges."}
{"text":"Do you primarily watch MTV and E!? Is your idea of a wild night a few too many beers and appetizers at your local Outback steakhouse or Chili's? Do you enjoy Sysco burgers and watered down cocktails?  Well come on down to the Nitty Gritty! Especially if it's your birthday!  I was roped into coming to the Nitty Gritty for a girlfriend's birthday. It was her last night in Madison before moving back to Utah, and she was determined to do a \"Madison birthday\" at the Nitty Gritty. It was her big day, so I was ready to do anything. We came in around 8 and were greeted by a buxom girl in her early 20s, with a tan only matched by Chester Cheetah. Once seated, a agitated waiter quickly breezed through the menu and pointed out all of the birthday appropriate shots.   I ordered a rum and coke to start, because honestly, how do you mess up a rum and coke? I received a coke and water, with a smack of rum to it. The birthday girl valiantly suggested shots, so we ordered a round of \"absinthe\" based shots that came out with glow sticks in them. Now, I'm not sure why the glow sticks were there, but maybe it was to distract from the fact that these tasted like a drink created to appeal to people who have heard of absinthe or the Green Fairy from Eurotrip, think it's cool, and don't know any better. Without going into more detail on the drinks, it suffices to say they were all diluted. Maybe this is a good tactic for a bar that attracts most of the binge drinking population of UW-Madison, or the newly minted 21 year old that is out to get completely hammered. The one redeeming feature of the bar that night was the shotski - four friends taking a shot from a ski. It was cute.  Do you remember burger day in middle school? The patties were uniform, charbroiled, and sat in a pool of brownish water until slapped on a bun into your tray? If you loved those burgers, you'll go nuts for the Nitty Gritty. Douse this sucker in ketchup, mustard, relish, onions, pickles, anything you can, because you're going to need it. Honestly, in a state that prides itself on its dairy and beef, why would you skimp on your burger? There are literally some of the best burgers in Madison to be found within a 3 block radius. Maybe they are hoping that the newly legal clientele still have a nostalgic sweet spot for those old cafeteria burgers (even I liked burger day when I was 13, but it's because it came with an awesome brownie).   As for the sides: you can expect an anemic salad with some forlorn croutons, and fries that are probably better than they have to be considering the standard Nitty Gritty fare.  Finally, we were lucky enough to be here for POWER HOUR!!!!!!11111 From 10-11 PM they reduce the price of their drinks to their actual value considering the watered down alcohol content.   In summation: friends don't let friends celebrate their birthdays at the Nitty Gritty. If you must, stop in for one shotski, a birthday drink, and move on."}
{"text":"Power hour cannot be beat. Amazing burgers, salads, cheese curds, nachos, wraps, and I am assuming everything else. Great place for birthday dinners and post-dinner festivities."}
{"text":"Friends of mine wanted to go here to celebrate some birthdays. It was cute - they gave the birthday ladies each a mug with a balloon tied to it, and they could go up to a special place at the bar to get free drinks all night. The free drinks were draught beers and a few basic mixed drinks, I think. It's very kitschy and this is the official birthday place. I ordered a burger, and it was perfectly good. Nothing to write home about, and it's good for groups. We came on a weeknight so I can't say anything about crowdedness. Seems like it's most fun if you're the one celebrating your birthday :) And free drinks all night - you can't complain about that!"}
{"text":"i went here for my birthday by myself (my hubby was away for work).  The food was good and the birthday sundae was fun.  They will even write your name on a board and read them off wishing you a happy birthday.  My server even volunteered to sing Happy Birthday to me, what a sweetie.  Just a good all around experience."}
{"text":"Great location before a UW hoop game, gets crowded, good beer selection. Food isn't the best, average pub food"}
{"text":"The year all of my friends and I turned 21 was a long year spent at the Gritty.  One birthday after another...and I must honestly say I never got sick of it.  I was here my 21st birthday and 22nd and I should have two really nice mugs but both years I managed to somehow lose them in all the free beer fun I was having.  Drinks are a little more expensive (probably to compensate for the free beer).  I've heard both good and bad about the food here from others but I must say I've never had any problems and do love their waffle fries.  I'll probably be here again for my birthday this year although it's on a Sunday."}
{"text":"Everyone has to stop in here for at least one bday if they are living in Madison!  Free souvenier mug filled with free beer (or soda) all day/night! That being said, I almost always refuse to come here.  It is usually way too jam packed, the music is the same every night, and the crowd is generally really, really young.... like, most have used fakes to get in young. I did work here a few summers ago, which enabled me to sample quite a bit of their food.  Suprisingly, they do have a good, homemade veggie burger.  With some of their waffle fries and gritty sauce on the side...mmmmmmm!  They also have really good cheese curds and it is sad to say but I also like their nachos!  And their daily specials are usually pretty good as well."}
{"text":"I've only been here for birthdays. Nitty Gritty offers free drinks for your birthday. Why not? What else can you ask for?  The burger of the day is a good surprise every now and then, but I like the Big Grit because it's their biggest burger.   It's loud here, but that's expected. Lots of college kids being obnoxious and all."}
{"text":"Despite having been going here for years and I've never been disappointed in any of the food that I've tried.  I'm very interested in the breakfast that just began.  Drink specials are generally fantastic and obviously it's the only place to go for birthdays."}
{"text":"We had the best experience here! Our server, Christine, was so friendly and skilled. With a couple food allergies and special needs, she got it right down to the tee and made us feel so comfortable about asking. My burger was totally delicious and my son's chicken sandwich was (and I quite) the best he's ever had:) thanks Gritty!!"}
{"text":"Stopped by this place after finishing the Madison Mini Marathon for a little post-race fatting as I like to call it. There wasn't much going on that day, but I can see that this would be a great place to stop by on a Saturday afternoon during football season to watch the games and have a beer.   The food itself was pretty good, the cheese curds were great, and the nitty gritty sauce that they have to dip it in is the stuff that dreams are made of (well, at least what my dreams are made of). The burger that I got was pretty good, although I had buyer's remorse for not getting a burger that had the nitty gritty sauce on it. The fries were okay, although I did like how they brought a cup of ranch out for dipping without even asking me (it's like they know me--and I had never even been to Wisconsin before).   Assuming I wind up in Madison again, I would definitely look this place up for another burger and another chance at those cheese curds."}
{"text":"Nice little place, and the free mug thing is pretty cool. I am informed they hardly card *anyone*, but I'm not sure whether that's the case or not. Nothing too huge, but it is a tradition, and it's kinda cute."}
{"text":"We have been to Nitty Gritty several times for the food, not for partying. Our most recent visit was prior to the Penn State basketball game. They have a great location near the Kohls Center, but on a game day, even if you arrive several hours before game time as we did, be prepared to battle the diners and the pregame drinking crowd. We put our names in upon arriving and sat there waiting for over an hour. In the mean time a lot of larger parties were consistently being seated. It seems as though parties of two are not a priority during their busy times.  After an hour I checked with the guy who was initiating the seating with his clipboard and headset, and he fumbled through his pages and didn't even find our name. He was however gracious enough to seat seat us promptly. There seemed to be quite a few open tables upstairs so I really don't understand why we were not seated earlier. My feeling is they cater more to larger parties of patrons and to the drinking crowd as tables full of folks seemed to camp out there. Well we wait another 10 minutes before our waitress finally acknowledges us by asking if we wanted drinks. Since we waited as long as we did, we already had time to review the menu and ordered our drinks as well as our burgers. Lucky for us the wait for our food was not as lengthy as our other waiting periods. I ordered a cheese burger done medium with chips and when it arrived the chips were cold as was the burger, and the burger was well done, not as ordered. The bun was generic and quite dried out, either from being under a lamp or from not being fresh, seeing that it was a Tuesday. Either way the burger was sub average. I would have sent it back but game time was in 45 minutes. Needless to say we ate our burgers drank our sodas and got the hell out of Dodge. You know if your into the party scene before the games the Nitty Gritty seems like a nice place to do this, but we're just not into it like we were when we were younger. Overall not impressed with the food, the pregame chaos or their seating practices or lack of. Waitress was almost non existent other than asking if our food tasted ok, never asked if we wanted a refill on our sodas. Frankly she was not deserving of the $4.00 tip that we left, so it was her lucky day....."}
{"text":"I wish I could do zero stars. It took a half hour to get an order of cold fries and they are not even that busy!!"}
{"text":"What can I say? Its a bar that serves free drinks on your birthday- its big, it serves food... great cheese curds.  I would 100% go back, only with friends.  But I suppose for how full it was when I was there, you could easily stand for say (22-seconds) before you meet someone to share a drink with.  Go, enjoy, drink, happy birthday."}
{"text":"I have been going to the nitty gritty since 1998 (and I have the birthday mugs to prove it). Tonight I went back, and got this burger with peppers and onion straws on Texas toast. It was amazing. I also got cheese curds on the side. Here's the deal with why ordering this was so exciting. I have a severe fish allergy. And anything even deep fried in the same oil as fish, I can't touch or I'll get really sick. I asked the bartender if he could check for me. Monday-Thursday they have fish free oil, and even a separate fryer. He let me know that Fridays are the only day they have fried fish and they change the oil every Monday. He also put in a special note about my allergy so they would put my stuff in the non-fish fryer and they would take special care. When I have an allergy attack, it sets in about 15 minutes after I eat the contaminated food. It has been over an hour since I've eaten and I'm feeling great. There aren't many places I can eat fried food in Madison, it's nice to know a place I've been going to for over a decade takes extra care for those with allergies. Thank you nitty gritty, it means the world to me."}
{"text":"Classic American meal. Burgers, beer, fries and Vegiterian friendly!! Our waitress Natalie E. Was great! Very friendly and helpful. The bartenders had a good beer understanding as well. I had the walnut burger \"Maggie\" and my husband had the Sunrise. Relaxing, loud, enjoyable, and American. Just what we wanted."}
{"text":"The best birthday bar in the country! I have been going to the Middleton location and the downtown Madison location since I was very young. I celebrate every birthday there and always enjoy coming back. They have great food and a great atmosphere. If it is you or your friend's birthday, make sure you grab a bite to eat here!"}
{"text":"Fun place! I will be back for my birthday. Got the simple burger, tasty, ive got my eye on a few others though! The gritty sauce is very good."}
{"text":"When the wait at Bassett Street Brunch Club is more than two hours long on a Sunday morning, head a few blocks down the street to the Nitty Gritty Birthday Bar where the servers are friendly and able to deal with 12 walk-ins. The food is pretty good for a big sports bar opera and the drinks are pretty clever. The bacon side dish is glorious, as are the hot fresh mini donuts."}
{"text":"A Madison classic!  Free beer (or soda) all night long on your birthday! Plus, they have the world's smallest sundaes!  The food isn't AMAZING, it is pretty typical bar food, although the Gritty Sauce is pretty epic, both on their burgers and as dipping sauce for their fries. You also get a lot of bang for your buck, I can never finish a burger and fries.  Don't expect homemade french fries or anything exotic, it is all pretty generic, but exists as a Madison tradition more than anything else.  Great for big groups of people - they are used to it, so they accommodate really well. They are also used to obnoxious drunkies, so they are pretty patient while you are celebrating your big day.  I would never stand in line to come here for a night of drinking, but as a celebration restaurant, it is great. The free mug has been a staple in my dishware"}
{"text":"Food-1 star. All through out college I tried very hard not to succumb to birthday dinner peer pressure. The gritty sauce is not good & I always leave nitty feeling like a train rammed into me. For a good burger, try dotty. Bar-3.5stars-only worth going during power hour. They raised the prices since I went to college, now a whopping $1.25 for a mixed drink, Madison I think I can afford this ;) the music is always Good but never new top hits, & the place is packed. I would never stay. Here past 11:15, leave & go to another bar! SKIP the FOOD."}
{"text":"Go to the Nitty Gritty for cheap alcohol. There's really no other reason to go.  The Nitty Gritty is an okay place if you're looking for a bar that has good drink specials. Other than that, the Nitty Gritty doesn't smell good inside -- the front entry area smells like a frat house (old beer/dirty carpet stench), doesn't have very good food and doesn't have very good service.   I went here for a friend's birthday party. I ordered a drink and some cheese curds. Our server was either confused or frazzled because, although the restaurant wasn't very busy at the time, she kept forgetting things and needed several reminders from us. My cheese curds weren't very good and were likely frozen. I know fresh, fried cheese curds -- and these definitely didn't fit the bill.  You can't go wrong with a $2 cocktail, though. The birthday beer and balloons are a cute concept as well.   PS: Anybody older than 25 is going to feel really old at the Nitty Gritty. The vast majority of patrons are college students."}
{"text":"I've been to the Nitty Gritty about four or five times before hockey games and always enjoyed it. The bar was full, a bit tough to get a bar but expected, and it seemed like a great time. We recently went there to watch the NCAA Football National Championship. I thought it'd be a nice place for a group of about 8 of us to watch it. The game wasn't on when we got there, and we mentioned we wanted to watch it and they sat us where we could see the game and then put the game on. There were a few tables of people in the bar with people, and all of us were interested in the game. However, they would not turn the sound on. We asked the waitress, and she spoke to the manage, and the returned to tell us sorry but she couldn't. We didn't really understand why, as everyone wanted to watch it, so we asked to talk to the manager. He came over and said his boss wouldn't let him do it, but he'd be happy to send this person over. Ok, we'll keep doing this, we thought. Yes, please send him over. Well that person never arrived. We waited and waited for about 20-30 min for the person to give us a reason why they wouldn't turn the sound on for a game that everyone was watching. We got fed up and walked over to the Steak and Lube that had the game on with sound and a lot of people watching it. I do not think I'll be heading back to the Nitty Gritty (unless it's before a hockey game) anytime soon."}
{"text":"Walked in on a recent Badgers basketball home game and the place was near dead.  Should have been the first tell-tale sign.  They started off with some ill-prepared food, peppered with poor to non-existant service, and left us with the sweetness of a messed up bill.  No matter how you added it up, \"the math didn't work,\" as the almighty would say.  I'd expect an experience like that at Denny's, at least they're offering a Hobbit menu this month."}
{"text":"The Nitty is a Madison staple, and although it has a college bar feel, it's still a great place to grab a beer and meet friends. The staff I've encountered have all been helpful and friendly - the bar was packed in the middle of a busy \"power hour\" but the bartenders patiently and attentively explained the menu and took our orders.   If you're looking for an inexpensive drink, come at 10:00pm for $1 High Life. If you're hungry for food, the burgers are also surprisingly decent."}
{"text":"The only reason you should ever go is for free/cheap drinks.  And even I have now gotten to the age where I would rather pay for drinks than put up with the Nitty experience.    The service is almost always terrible.  Once we were rudely told by a waitress that she \"wasn't allowed to wait on us\" while she was taking orders for the rest of our group and she would have to send another waiter for no apparent reason.  He didn't show up for another 40 minutes, and she continued to serve only 80% of our table... Another time, we waited 45 minutes to see a server, then another hour to get food, yet there were 3 serves for 4-5 tables.  Not busy by any means.  The food is also way overpriced for how average it is, so there's no point in going there to actually eat.    The only decent part of the Nitty are the bartenders.  They're always really nice and go above and beyond, even when it's totally packed.  They must be absolute saints to put up with the power hour crowd."}
{"text":"Ate here a few weeks ago on business. What can I say, this is a college bar with average bar food. We had the cheese curds, which were good, but my burger was less than delicious. It was completely average and kind of dry. I tried the s'mores (I believe) martini, and it was good and strong."}
{"text":"We came to Nitty Gritty for breakfast one Sunday morning.  We were in from out of town and we needed breakfast ASAP.  Unaccustomed to the lines in Madison (what's with that?) we opted to come here because we could sit down right away.  The one thing that was strange was how dark the setting was.  Outside it was bright and inside felt like night.  Anyway- we were happy to be sitting with drinks in our hands.  We ordered cheese curds, because, Wisconsin.  We had a mixture of breakfast and lunch items and everyone enjoyed their food.  They were on a limited menu which was disappointing, but I would have been interested to try other things.  This was a comfortable college bar type place to sit, drink and relax, I would come back here."}
{"text":"I used to go to the Nitty Gritty for many occasions. Not anymore.  During a crowded late afternoon I left my friend at a table with my coat, phone and a beverage with our meal ordered. I went outside to my car to get my tickets for an upcoming game. I was refused reentry and forced to wait in line without my coat on a cold day.  I pleaded my case even pointing at my table and friend 20 feet away. No matter to them. Wow!  Management mumbled something about overcapacity and the firecode.  Needless to say my food was cold and my evening ruined."}
{"text":"Nitty Gritty is a place I only go to when I have a coupon or am near the Kohl Center. I know there burgers come highly rated but honestly they are pretty meh. First floor bar on a quiet night is pretty nice and relaxing. Also was pleasantly impressed with the Italian flatbread melt. I'll probably be back next time I'm near the Kohl Center"}
{"text":"Madison classic, it is. You know usually when you come to a restaurant, a host will greet you, take you to a table, and waiter will come out and ask you what would you like to drink. At that point, I already knew what to order: THE Gritty Burger, no pickles, extra sauce on the side please. Less than ten minutes after that, my food will come right on the table. Their fries are also unusually always very good, even though they don't look like anything special at all. Fun place to celebrate a birthday, fun place to watch games together with your friends, fun place to g et an unlimited beer on your own birthday. Enough said."}
{"text":"What's the point? Oh right, free mug and beer. But wouldn't you rather pay money for good beer and have the added bonus of letting your friends enjoy the evening too?  Almost tempted to give another star just for the pleasure of seeing two blood-thirsty vegetarians shotgun a cornucopia of game in Deer Hunter."}
{"text":"Fun if you're the type for a loud, hyperactive atmosphere laden with \"flair\" ala the Office Space variety. They do have good food if you are looking for burgers and fries. Not my place for a birthday but that's mostly because it's not my style. It's obviously well-loved by many in Madison."}
{"text":"Due to the theme/gimmick of the Nitty, it's one of those places that as a student/downtown resident, you'll inevitably end up here at least once for a birthday bash. And everytime that i'm invited to a get together here, I get a sinking feeling, and moan outloud to myself, knowing that i'm going to have a not so great night planned. My main 2 problems with the Nitty are the two things I go out for: Good food, and a pleasant atmosphere. SPOILER: They're lacking in both.  Concerning the food: I didn't find any of their appetizers particularly memorable anytime I went there. So, they weren't bad, but not anything I can't have done better at other places. When I had their burgers a few years ago, I had a similar sentiment about them. They aren't bad, but i'd rather have a burger at the Old Fashioned or even The Plaza. But, in the last couple years, I became a vegetarian, and luckily for me (or so I thought), the Nitty has veggie burgers! But, there's one problem with that: The veggie patties there suck. Like really bad. Like so bad that I only ate three bites of the burger I ordered before putting it down for good. And they have the nerve to charge more for them too. Good veggie patties definitely exist (See: DLUX, The Echo Tap, The Harmony Bar), so i'd recommend that the chefs here take some notes from those restaurant's books. Just the fact that a place would serve something so awful takes their entire menu down a couple notches.  Concerning the atmosphere: It's just too tacky and in your face for me to tolerate. All over the walls are pictures of people who celebrated birthdays at the Nitty ( I even saw one of my friends when he was like 2!). Like I know it's their theme, but it's still pretty corny. If you dare step out of the dining room, and into the bar, then you're in for a real nightmare. It takes forever to get a drink, and the music they play is so deafeningly loud and horrible (Tangent: I know music taste is subjective, but their playlist really rubs me the wrong way, because I hate hate HATE hair metal with every fiber of my being, and i'm pretty sure the selector here isn't aware that music after the year 1995 exists), that you literally have to scream at the top of your lungs just to have the bartender or anyone you want to have a conversation with hear you. I'm not even exaggerating about how loud it is; Like i'm legit concerned that they're committing OSHA violations for forcing employees to work in a setting where they'll lose their hearing. It's even worse during \"Power Hour\" (10-11 PM), where a plethora of bottom tier liquors and piss waters (or \"domestics\" as some call it) are ultra cheap. Avoid being there at that time at all costs.  On second thought, just avoid going here regardless of the time of day. You might be able to squeak by a tolerable experience due to the menu having some decent items and most of the wait/bar staff being nice, but more often than not, you'll have wished that you went somewhere else for your bash."}
{"text":"After having my birthday at this bar for four straight years - it was a rude awakening when I turned 23 and didn't live near the Gritty to get my Gritty burger, birthday mug, and to hear my name shout loud and proud over the loud speaker. Fond memories were made here... Moving on... this is a great restaurant/bar for just about anyone. It's UW themed, great on football Saturdays, and of course known as \"the\" birthday bar. Check it out if you're a student, prospective student, or just new to Madison. Get the gritty sauce."}
{"text":"Eh.  It is nothing special.  Sure you get to drink free beer on your birthday but then you have to deal with the large number of students.    The prices are high for the people you go with.  I want to like that place, but the truth is the other bars have the same things to offer for lower prices.    Their specials and COMPLETELY inconvenient.  I get it.  Pull people in during your slow hours but they are too inconvenient.  I am a girl who likes to drink and stay out but the Nitty Gritty is just not worth it.    Sorry I do feel bad.  Oh, wait, I don't.  Bars are a dime a dozen in Madison, so do something to stand out!"}
{"text":"Pretty fun college bar! Went on a Sunday night in the summer so it was pretty empty. That being said, they had some great drink specials. Service was ok not great. When we got there, we just walked in only to be chased by the bouncer a few minutes later because he was off who knows where. The drinks seemed pretty easy but took longer than other places around town. We sat in a nice large booth which was clean (I have found sticky tables common, especially in college towns)."}
{"text":"Burgers are comparable to Burger King in taste and depth...  if you want to come and have a beer and curds this would be a great spot with Madison lore."}
{"text":"I've come to the Nitty Gritty more times than I'd like to admit.  I've eaten here upwards of 5 times, and not one of those times have been remarkable in any way, shape, or form.  At best, the food is just okay.    It's always teeming with loud partygoers, even in the restaurant.  This is too much for me when I'm just trying to eat food.  Thus, I wouldn't recommend it if you just want to eat food and are not celebrating yours, or someone else's birthday.  The very worst part is that you have to hear the \"Happy Birthday\" song (not the one you're thinking of--a hellish variant) about 18 times while you're there.  The good parts?  Excellent (and I do mean excellent) drink specials most nights.  Prompt bar service.  Free mug with the year on it for your birthday (with all the beer or soda you can handle).  Pictures of past partygoers on the wall to snicker at."}
{"text":"Not my favorite bar in Madison nor is it my favorite burger in Madison, but the place does have a corner on the birthday market. Hell, it is tradition and it can even be a lot of fun (especially if there is a balloon artist lurking about).  They do have a pretty good beer selection (I love when they get in any brew that Capitol only made small batches of) and it can be a good place to spend an afternoon watching sports. Drinks can be a bit costly, but enough people are willing to pay it.  It can get a little hectic when there are events at the Kohl Center though and it can be damn near impossible to get a drink on the weekend nights."}
{"text":"I've only had the gritty burger and fries and they're both really good. Their happy hour is at 10p which is kind of annoying that it's late and not something you can partake in after class or work (I mean, you could but you'd be waiting a while). The staff are mostly really nice with a sprinkle of people that look like they hate their jobs. As the other people who have reviewed this place, they are THE birthday place so come here if you want a free drink and balloon."}
{"text":"Free drinks on your birthday?! Yes you heard that right! All you can drink beer on your birthday! You also get a balloon and birthday mug!   They have a wide variety of beers on tap, which is a super plus! I had an order of the cheese curds during their happy hour, so they were half off! Just basic curds but the dipping sauce was amazingly tasty! I believe it was called \"Gritty\" sauce. I also ordered the garlic burger which was sooooooo good! Best burger I've had in awhile! The sides were pretty basic though, I tried the French fries and cole slaw.   Overall, come for the burgers and beer and definitely come out for your birthday!"}
{"text":"Bringing my review back up to 4 stars. Yeah, this place isn't perfect, but its pros certainly outweigh its cons. The best things about the Nitty: I swear by their hamburgers. They are VERY good and very satisfying. My fav is the bleu cheese one... it's fatty and tasty and I'm kind of drooling just thinking about it. The second best thing... birthdays! You get a bday mug (which are awesome collectibles btw) and your choice of free beer or a free grapey mixed drink! It's ideal to invite all your friends and bask in the glory of them watching you drink fo free all night. The third best thing is power hour. Every night, 10-11, $1.50 mixed drinks and $1.00 beers. It's a solid place to pregame for cheap before heading to the bars! Pro tip: they usually don't end it until around 11:15. Once they start playing \"The Final Countdown,\" it's about to end, so scurry on up and order 5 drinks for under $10! Hehe. Basically, the Nitty is a classic and I'll be hitting it up every time I visit Madison... for life."}
{"text":"I enjoyed a pomegranate something in honor of Aaron Rodgers' birthday--it was fantastic... so I had a few more.  My grass-fed burger was just what the doctor ordered on a cold day in December after a long day at work (okay, okay--maybe it was the ARs' cocktails).   The seating was a bit tight (we had a party of 9, and sat at a long table against the wall. But it was cozy and fun. I prefer the dining room to the bar area (as the bar is a bit too open and seems chaotic to me--although, again, at that point, I was full of sweet, sweet pomegranate boozes).  Will I go back? Sure. It's not my favorite place downtown, but I wouldn't say no if someone asked me."}
{"text":"The Nitty Gritty seems to be a popular place to hang out in Madison, but I don't see the charm. I mean it's a typical pub/bar that specializes in celebrating birthdays, but besides the celebrating the birth of ones life there's nothing special about this place.   I've been here twice and each time received poor service at the bar. I can't speak for the food or table service, but the food didn't look like anything special.  I also think the only reason this place is ever full is because Madison lacks decent bars and people have limited options."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a bar for before or after an event at the Kohl Center, look no further than the Nitty Gritty. They have TVs everywhere and will always have the Badger/Packers game on. They have top notch bar food. The bar itself always has some good local beer and plenty of booze options. The crowd is really mixed, especially on game day. It skews more collegiate the later it gets, but it is a good place to bring a family during the day or earlier in the evening. Power Hour is their daily special with $1 beer and rails from 10-11pm. Their service has always been fantastic, but sometimes it just gets too packed in there on a big game day. It's a hard problem and nobody else on campus will treat you better. Oh, and on your birthday, you get free beer.   Menu highlights: Pretzel Bender Burger, Seasoned Waffle Fries (with Gritty Sauce of course), and the Chocolate Peanut Butter Shake.  Overall it's a really fun, locally owned, college sports bar with great bar food, above average drinks, and it's just 1 block from the Kohl Center."}
{"text":"Nice looking place, lots of room for parties and regular seating. When we walked in they asked if we were celebrating a birthday. You get a birthday mug on your birthday. Nice, friendly bartender and the food was good. Not great, but very good. I was a little turned off by the soggy bun and cold bacon but it tasted good."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times, and it isn't bad, but I really have found nothing great here that can't be found elsewhere in Madison. The burgers are ok, but Amy's and Dotty's both are better at making burgers. The drink selection I remember being decent, but nothing special. That's pretty much all I have to say about the Nitty Gritty."}
{"text":"Pretty cool place.. we live out of state and were in town for business and looking to experience madison and were directed here.  The place was pretty busy upon arrival and we posted up at the bar.  Power hour then started at ten which was awesome.. Cheap drop shots etc for an hour and this place just went nuts..  Food seemed pretty good as we all got burgers and I think at some point cheese curds as well.  Cool place, the birthday thing is pretty sweet as well.  On your bday- you drink all night for free? i think.  I will return"}
{"text":"Free beer is cool and the prices are right.  The burgers are mediocre at best.  The bun was stale, they forgot the special sauce and the sides were just ok.  Meh.  I don't hate it but its certainly not even close to the best burger in town."}
{"text":"great niche.  People go in cuz of the awesome birthday deal.  Minus that it's pretty much just there.  Food's decent."}
{"text":"I need to start going here for my birthday, but I seem to have this weird curse on me when it comes to this place. Every time a friend has a birthday and plans on having their party here, I get a really bad cold. It never happens when they plan to go anywhere else, but it's happened for six or more birthdays. I'm a little nervous to make plans to go here for my own birthday. I don't want to end up sick!  Well I sucked it up and came to two of the parties. The food was pretty good, but over priced in my opinion. It also took forever to get it all.The drinks weren't bad, but I really think the only appeal is to come here and get the free drinks on your birthday. My friends participated in the special hours, whatever they were, and they said the prices weren't bad during that time slot."}
{"text":"Nitty Gritty was a birthday tradition for our family when I was growing up. This location is our favorite one! Now that my husband is a Madison-newbie, it is a guarantee that we go there for his birthday celebrations!   I believe it is free beer (or soda) all day on the day of your birthday (or within a week of.) You get a glass collectible mug for your drank and pick your balloon color! Lol.   This is standard American fare with friendly service! When I came in with a broken ankle (and a wheelchair,) staff cleared a place at the table for me and made sure that I was comfortable.   The Gritty Burger and vanilla milkshake cannot be beat. Come and enjoy yourself!"}
{"text":"There's really not a whole lot about the Nitty Gritty that needs to be said other than this: It's OK at best.  The food isn't amazing, the drinks are mediocre, and the atmosphere is loud and generally overcrowded. It's nothing to write home about, but when it's your birthday--why not? Free stuff isn't a bad reason to come here, but there's no reason to come here otherwise when there's much better places to go."}
{"text":"We stopped here before a Badgers football game without knowing anything about the bar. Despite how busy the area was before a football game, we were seated immediately and had good service. They have a very good selection of local and non-local beers. The highlight of the stop for me was the Wisconsinite burger, which had slices of summer sausage on it. I'm not from Wisconsin so maybe that's a normal thing to locals, but for me it was a real unique treat and I still think about how good that burger was!"}
{"text":"I can't believe they are getting bad reviews! The Gritty is one of my favorite restaurants of all time. The quality and service has gotten better and better. Their menu is larger every year. This place is iconic and should never get a bad review...ever!"}
{"text":"As soon as you enter and tell them it's your birthday, you get to pick your balloon and then head to the bar to start your unlimited drinks! Soda of course for those who are underage.   I got the sirloin burger with waffle fries. It came on Texas Toast and was honestly such a great burger. I was so full I couldn't finish it. It was probably because of the first mug I finished before the food came out.  Great for groups. I saw a lot of families with kids too. I got a tiny sundae at the end with a lit candle. It was adorable. The ambiance is nice. It's very dark inside. In interested to see what it's like during the day.   I like how they call all of the names of people who have come in to celebrate their birthdays. They also write your name on the board at the bar!   Great service. Great food. I'm going to checking out for lunch some time."}
{"text":"Good place for burgers when eating out with a mixture of carnivores & vegetarians. Birthdays too."}
{"text":"It's been awhile since I've been to the Nitty Gritty - at least a few years. We recently stopped back in on my boyfriend's birthday so he could take advantage of the bottomless mug you get just for being born.   We were out around 6 on a Thursday - the bar was pretty empty when we arrived, but it was quite full by the time we left a little after 7. Bar service was prompt and polite, and they were sure to refill the birthday boy's mug as soon as it emptied. There's a special railed off area for birthday patrons to get refills, but sitting at the bar will also get the job done.   Though it's been years since I've eaten at the Nitty, but I have fond memories of the chicken strips and Gritty sauce - next time we want some deep-fried goodness I'll have to keep the Nitty in mind. I'll probably opt for takeout though - while we had a nice enough time, I felt very, very, very old. Most customers were college kids, and families celebrating with their children. I asked to sample a raspberry hef that was on tap and the bartender told me it was her favorite thing on the line. One sip told me why - it was super sweet and tasted like a combo of raspberry Pucker and stevia. College me might have also liked it, but adult me wants no part of a drink that could be replicated by dumping a Smirnoff Ice into a Miller Lite.   Long story short - it's hard to beat free birthday drinks, but if your plan isn't to get plastered, stop by earlier rather than later."}
{"text":"My husband and I met friends and family Saturday 5:00pm for a 21st birthday party of a cousin. We had a group of 30. We were greeted pleasantly, all of the host staff were very friendly and helpful. We went to the bar downstairs to get the birthday girl stated. The gentlemen bar tending was awesome. He was fun, smiling, making jokes. Great at his job. Once our entire party had arrived we were taken upstairs to be seated. Getting 30 people seated and settled takes a few minutes. So we decided to grab a few beers at the upstairs bar. I walked up to the bar.  A waitress then comes up and explains to me that the hallway I walked down was for staff only. I apologized, I was a little embarrassed, I didn't see a sign and honestly didn't know. I stood at the bar where a bartender (Trevis) stood and blankly glared at me awkwardly for 1-2 minutes. I decided to speak. He was staring right at my face, he was making eye contact. No one else was around. I said, hello. He stood there just looking at me. I then said, may I get a couple of beers? He continued to just look at me. He has still not said a single word to me. I said, Bud Light, Miller Light, Spotted Cow. He then says, Don't do that again. I said, Excuse me? He said, Don't walk through there again. I said, yes I understand. There is not a sign. I didn't know. That has to happen all of the time. He never said another word to me. I had a $20 in my hand. He put the beers on the bar. I handed him my money and nothing. No thank you, no hello, no what can I get for you, NOTHING!!!! I was so upset by the way I was treated it took me my entire dinner to calm down. I am a 37 year old woman with 3 children. I'm not some drunk college kid who is blatantly disregarding signs or rules. It was an honest mistake. To be scolded and treated like a child from some rude hateful kid who looks half my age was so extremely inappropriate.  I can tell you that I have never been treated so poorly by someone who works for tips. Hello! Tervis should not be working with customers. I mentioned the incident to one of the waitresses. She informed me that the staff also have a problem with his attitude.  It just leaves such a negative impression that I don't know when or if we will be back. I know we are just one family but it shouldn't happen to anyone else. That kid should not be in customer service."}
{"text":"Still waiting for birthday beer. For a bar known for birthdays, we can't seem to get a birthday beer and have been waiting here for atleast 15 minutes in front of the bar with a balloon. Please continue to ignore me."}
{"text":"Great food, relaxed atmosphere, reasonable prices. Love power hour there. Usually not too crammed like other bars in the area. The upstairs is definitely the best place to sit with spacious booths and tables. A must for birthdays."}
{"text":"Always a place that is packed post 10pm. That is as far as the bar scene. 10-11pm is power hour which means awesome deals on rail mixers. Yes, just rail mixers, but at $1.25 per drink anyone can afford to pregame here. Post power hour things calm, but other deals continue.  This may be one of the most visited bars during my college years, we commonly stopped in for drinks.  Brunch-- I have been for this and it is worth it. Compared to others near, the brunch is easy to get in to, just as good, well priced, and the drinks are good for morning too!  Lunch/diner--burgers are obvi what this place is good at. They offer many great ones, awesome milkshakes, and good cheesecurds  (classic wisco).  Birthdays-- they give free drinks and fun to birthday participants, and it is a blast. Everyone goes here at some point during a birthday night. Overall. So much this place has to offer, beers, drinks, meals, fun, and all the good vibes. I only cation against weekend nights from 10-11pm(power hour), this is when lines are longer than they are worth. But show up early for this and wait, it will be packed and fun. Or, show up later it will also be happening on weekends and the deals are always something I do not hate."}
{"text":"Had brunch here yesterday. Wasnt too impressed. Liked that they sourced a lot locally, but the food wasnt anything special. Coffee was awful. Do not get the coffee. Mini donuts were good though!"}
{"text":"It depends what you're looking for. This is a great sports bar with a chill atmosphere. The service is good, and there is always a drink special. The food is decent, nothing outstanding but if you're hungry you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Been here a bunch of times.  This is the first in which I've kept my wits about me in order to make a review.  I would have gone with \"meh\" save for a few key points.  We'll start with the not-so-great.  Despite the small crowd, it took an awfully long time for a soda, Arnold Palmer, and chocolate milk after we had placed the order.  In fact, the cheese curds showed up before the milk.  Aside from the slow-end service, our son's chocolate sunday was forgotten and we had to ask another server for to-go boxes and the payment of our bill.  The better: Burgers are great.  Waffle fries are always a bonus in my book.  The cheese curds are fair.  And even though we didn't partake, free beer on your birthday is always a plus.  Not to mention, seating was immediate while other places in the area could only offer a 30-minute wait.  We'll be back, but only for celebrating birthdays or entertaining out-of-town friends before sporting events."}
{"text":"Good place to grab some traditional bar food! My husband drank for free because it was his birthday in three days. Got to choose from some drafts. Started off with the white Cheese curds, they were yummy. I got the Jason's pork pretzel sandwich, and my husband got the gritty burger, and the kids got grilled cheese. My sandwich was really good. I would definitely get it again. My husband said his burger was good, but the odd thing was it came with no tomato, lettuce or onion side garnish. I think he was expecting more of a WOW Factor and didn't get it. They give you enough fries for three people. The grilled cheese was enjoyed by the kiddos, and I appreciated the waiter asking what kind of cheese they preferred. At the meals end, the waiter brought out little shot glasses with tiny sundaes in them for all of us and sang happy birthday! I would love to go again on game day minus the kids!"}
{"text":"It's 89° inside this bar right now. Way too hot for a conducive drinking environment. This is a sauna"}
{"text":"This place is solid. Free drinks on your birthday, free ice cream sundae every month and an awesome brunch menu.   So the birthday thing probably makes it such that there are a lot of rowdy college kids here at night, but I don't come here at night. Even if you're just looking for an afternoon drink, you need to come claim your free drink(s) on your birthday! If only for the awesome mug you can take home.   The brunch menu is really unique. I wasn't expecting the food to be very good and was pleasantly surprised. I'm obsessed with the cheese curd breakfast burrito. For anyone who likes bloodies, the brunchzilla is a liter and has enough garnishes to be a complete meal. It has A HAMBURGER on it and comes with a PINT beer chaser! So much fun!"}
{"text":"I was pleased with the juicy burgers, big portions and very excellent fried items.  I had the BBC burger with mushrooms, mini corn dogs, deep fried curds, waffle fries, regular fries, coleslaw and chicken fingers.  I loved it all.   The beer selection is great and there are a lot of local beers on tap.  Too bad it wasn't my birthday or else I could've gotten free beers all night.  It was pretty empty the night I went, but this seems unusual from the other reviews.  There's also some outdoor seating.  The waitstaff seems to vary quite a bit in terms of competency.  We sat down at the same time as the table next to us and they had all their food before we even had silverware or napkins."}
{"text":"Pretty OK service, server was upset that one of our group members constantly ordered water. At one point she slammed it on the table and didn't make eye contact while walking away. Also, another one of our group members ordered a beer and it came with several black flakes in it. I asked and she gladly replaced the beer, but still made us pay, which is fine. But I usually expect whatever they messed up free.......Photo attached."}
{"text":"1st time eating here was yesterday. I had the BBQ beef brisket sandwich with onion rings & both were delicious. Came back today to Oder something else.  Hamburger was also delicious. Friendly environment and restaurant was very clean & nice.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"A poem to the Gritty...  Oh Nitty Gritty, I have spent much time at your bar, Eating cheese cards and imbibing in too many drinks, by far.  Your Gritty sauce never ceases to amaze me, I would celebrate many birthdays here if I wasn't absentee.  When I visit Madison, I enjoy swinging by, For a burger, a beer or just to say hi."}
{"text":"Love, Love, Love the brunchzilla! This is a great hangover remedy! Get yourself a burger and other Wisconsin toppings with a side of beer (pint) and jumbo bloody mary. Why not?! This is a meal in itself and covers all of the food groups. Yum! I think they are normally $15 on the menu, but we usually find a Hooked deal for $10 on Sundays. The best $10 I've spent!"}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere and great burgers, but the rest of the food is just ok and it does get pretty crowded"}
{"text":"Eh, not my favorite. The crowd is a smattering of college kids as well as older folks celebrating their 10th? 11th? 12th? 21st birthday anniversary. It's a strange combination.  Drinks are weak during their $1.25 rail drink hour. Seriously, I'd rather pay a few bucks more and get a full-strength beverage. The only thing I found impressive at the bar was how trashed my friends managed to get off of $20 worth of booze."}
{"text":"For as long as I lived in Madison, my nearest and dearest friends and I have always had the moral dilemma of whether to go to the Nitty Gritty for their birthday.  It is true that you get free beer on your birthday and a fancy mug as well.  However, choosing to do so meant you were subjecting some of your best friends to okay food and kitchy sometimes annoying atmosphere.  (That damn birthday song!) Additionally, your friends may have to put up with you if you overindulge on your free brew, and your friends might be crabby about this since they had to pay for THEIR beer.  Nonetheless, some of my dearest rave about the Gritty sauce and my friend flew BACK to Madison from the west coast on his 26th just to go to the Gritty.  (maybe to see some friends, who knows about that kid) In sum, there's all of your Wisconsin typical favorites: cheese curds, beer, burgers, beer, and a Friday Fish Fry.  If you have a more sophisticated birthday/drinking/eating palate, I suggest you stay away."}
{"text":"Came here on New Year's Day because we saw the sunrise burger on their online menu but they didn't have it because they were serving their holiday menu. We were able to add a fried egg to our burgers for an extra $1 which was good enough for us. Not too busy. Fun music selection. Service was good. Typical bar food. Loved the spicy mustard. And apparently you get to drink free beer here for your birthday!"}
{"text":"We came here for a late lunch before the game.  We waited about 15 minutes for a table for two and just hung out at the bar until our name was called.  Then we got seated at a booth upstairs next to the window which had a nice view.  Drinks - I chose from their summer cocktails, I had the mint tea julep.  It was pretty good, but I was a little shocked by the quarter inch of sugar sitting at the bottom of my cup.  I guess the menu did call out sugar as one of the ingredients.  My friend just got the spotted cow, which you can't go wrong with  Food - We shared the mini corn dogs to start which are always good - you can't really go wrong with those.  Then I had the nachos off the appetizer section which came out on a giant platter and could feed four people.  I liked the mix of cheeses, some shredded and some of the nacho cheese dip.  My friend had a chicken sandwich which she also enjoyed.    The service was attentive and fast, the food was pretty good and affordable.  And if you're local, it sounds like it's worth coming out here on your birthday."}
{"text":"For an individual well beyond his college days. This place was a fun spot to get the cheep drinks and college vibes from yesteryears. Plus as a current Chicago resident passing through, it is hard to deny the affordable drinks. 5$ makers with a pickle back yummmm!"}
{"text":"Ate upstairs- food was good, its quintessential bar food, very similar to what you would get from the competition, I'm sure.  I had the Grittyburger, kids enjoyed the mini corn dogs, and were seated close to TVs to watch end of the football game.  Nice.  Pitcher of beer a little steep, but service was fast, we were able to get in and out in about 45 minutes, a good thing when we're going to the hockey game.  Ate upstairs, had a nice table where you could see and was nice and bright before the sun went down.  Loud."}
{"text":"The nit grit is a birthday classic that keeps on giving. the veggie burger is quite excellent, but those cheese curds knock it out of the park EVERY. TIME.   The alcoholic milkshakes are decadent, and although this spot can get annoyingly fratty, the cheap drinks during power hour make up for it. love the creative drinks too - the shot menu alone is impressive.   my favorite bartender by far is Collin. quick with the pour and patient with customers, his charm really completes the easygoing feel that the nitty provides."}
{"text":"Every UW alum celebrates their birthday here at least once. It's definitely worth it once you are 21+ strictly for the limitless beer. The food is better than you'd expect.  Since it is a birthday spot, they take that idea pretty seriously. Which can be annoying if you just want a burger and a beer. But then I'd suggest you go somewhere else and come back for power hour.  Back in my day, power hour was $1 drinks from 10-11, but I've heard they upped the price by a quarter (kind of absurd). Still worth it. They don't have a minimum on the drinks you can buy during that time, so take advantage and order as much as you can hold."}
{"text":"The most awful experience I've ever had at a bar. Ordered cheese curds and it took more than an hour for them to come. The manager threatened to kick me out because I expressed my displeasure that my food was taking forever. Are you kidding me? NEVER go here for food. Only take advantage of their power hour specials....that's all Nitty is good for. AWFUL EXPERIENCE"}
{"text":"Amazing place to stop for lunch!!! I had the mac and cheese with pork on top. HUGE bowl and oh so delicious!  My son, who considers himself quite the hamburger connoisseur, got the gritty burger and said it was amazing!  They even brought small little ice cream sundaes for kids after lunch.  My grandma got fish tacos and there were three huge ones! She said they were so good."}
{"text":"The drinks were ridiculously cheap, the service was good and I met some really awesome folks here. From what I gathered, this place is a Madison landmark. Crowded, but I came on a night when the Badgers B-ball team was playing a home game at The Kohl Center, which is only two or three blocks away. Can't speak on the food. I think the folks giving this place one and two star reviews need to lighten up."}
{"text":"The Nitty is a game day staple.   Good burgers, good sandwiches, good drink deals.  My go to meal recently is the grilled cheese and soup.  With their grilled cheese, you get to select two cheeses to use.  My choice is American and Mozzarella.  It has that taste you think of and the mozzarella makes it really gooey!  The soups are always really good too!  If soup is not your thing, order fries, cole slaw, or a salad.  The bar is a good place to wait for a pal before the game or to watch the game on TV.  The restaurant part has some TVs too but it's a bit more for conversations and Birthdays.  If it's your birthday, don't forget to bring your ID for a mug full of beer or soda refills.  It's not a fancy place but it's a Madison tradition.  Definitely worth a check and see."}
{"text":"Food was fine. The ringing of the \"Birthday bell\" was very obtrusive and I had to knock down a star."}
{"text":"This restaurant was a quick walk from a training I attended at a nearby hotel. Sports bar atmosphere. Food was quick and sandwiches were good. I had a salmon sandwich. Cheap and filling lunch option."}
{"text":"The gritty burger is my guilty pleasure. While its a great place to get free booze and commemorative glass on your birthday, I enjoy the Gritty year round for bar food and decent taps. It's a great place for lunch as it's not super crowded since students are in class. The price is reasonable especially for being on campus.  Also they make a mean matzoh ball soup on Wednesdays!"}
{"text":"We come here yearly on our vacation and honestly the staff is always awesome and the food we've yet to be disappointed. We get something different every time but one of the 3-5 things we order is always the spin dip in the bread bowl amaze balls!"}
{"text":"The birthday spot! It is always fun coming here on your birthday for all the freebies you get (bottomless beer, birthday dessert, NITTY GRITTY MUG!).   I've been to this location a few time and enjoyed the bday luxuries. Beyond the shiny freebies, it's a decent place to grab a burger, lots of veggie options in the burger department!   They have an extremely cheap \"power hour\" where you can get $1.25 drinks (the cups are small, but c'mon, it's still a great deal). It's usually v crowded during that time, but not impossible to get a drink.   Service varies, but it's a rather large restaurant and the food is very reasonable, so I don't typically go in expecting fine dining service.   In summary: go on your birthday!"}
{"text":"This place should be avoided. Both the food and service are horrible, and there are much better restaurants in the city of Madison that deserve the business. On my most recent trip to this establishment, my server forgot about our table for about 20 minutes. We sat with our menus open, looking around for her to walk by so that we could flag her down. We finally had to ask a different server to go get her, which is when she finally came to take our order. No apology from her for the delay. When the food came, it was disappointing at best. The Brisket sandwich was made with a horrible type of meat, not sure if could even call it meat. The fries were good, but those are probably from a frozen bag that they pop in the deep fryer. This place is not worth a second chance. Would definitely recommend checking out the other burger restaurants in the city that have both good food and good service."}
{"text":"With the Nitty Gritty, you have to know what you are getting yourself into. I hadn't been here for my birthday for a couple years, and my last birthday reminded me why I loved the place so much.  Obviously this is a great place to go on your birthday. Free beer or soda or (this was news to me) a couple low cost cocktails all day! You get your mug (and a balloon or button if you are so inclined). Shots are varied and relatively inexpensive, and the food is solid. My personal favorites are the Gritty Burger and Fries (I can thank those fries for saving me from detox on my 21st Birthday!) and the boneless wings, which are HUGE thin chicken breast strips breaded and served in a choice of sauce.  The atmosphere is always fun, and really the only drawback is that it can be really crowded with somewhat slow service at times. I don't recommend it if you need to get in and out quick for a Badger Basketball or Hockey Game or for state High School tournaments.  But if you happen to have a day off on your birthday and can get a little loopy at lunch, this is a great spot."}
{"text":"Nitty Gritty is an awesome place to go for your birthday as you get free beer all night.  The food is pretty good also - I recommend the Texas burger.  The bar has good deals on drinks at night, and usually has a pretty good vibe. I've had mixed experiences with the staff but is overall good."}
{"text":"Ack.    Being Madison's \"Favorite Birthday Bar\" means you get free cheap beer on your birthday and mug.  But it also means that you have to spend your birthday eating bar food that's easily bested by numerous places within walking distance of the Gritty and enduring the obnoxious sports bar with balloons atmosphere.  Any friend that takes you here on your birthday is no friend of yours."}
{"text":"Three stars seems about right.  Finding a spot on the second or first floor is always easy, as long as you show up before 9:00.  The tales are true: all you can drink tap beers on your birthday! This of course means that, after a certain point in the evening, the undergrads descend on the bar like over dressed 4-year-olds to a Burger King ball pit.  Otherwise, it's a decent place to grab a beer and watch a game."}
{"text":"I was in town for a concert and decided to come here for brunch. There were two level to this place and the downstairs was filled with college aged kids having some fun celebrating the Master's. Without even asking, they could tell we were not there to party and seated us upstairs which was much more quiet and relaxed. I was definitely happy they decided to seat us up there. Our waitress was amazing and the food was good too. We got the mini donuts to start which were perfect. We also had mimosas - I went with the traditional mimosa and my friend got a strawberry one which was really gross and our waitress swapped it out with no problem. I ordered the Wisco scrambler which was amazing but their sausage gravy was very sub-par in my opinion. I would definitely go there again if I lived in the area, but if you're just visiting from out of town I feel like there are better options."}
{"text":"Go there on your birthday. Free beer with their complete selection yours for the taking.  If you can't have fun there that day there is no hope for you."}
{"text":"Came here 5 pm pre-hockey game.  It was a 20-25 minute wait for a table.  Not too bad of a wait and we had the time so we opted to grab a drink and wait.  We weaved through people, managed to find a space big enough for our party of four to stand, though we were still elbowed and bumped as others weaved through.  But, if it's this busy, must be awesome, right?  Ok, I understand I'm not 21 anymore and bar hopping isn't a typical night, but the music was insanely loud.  People were shouting to try to converse, and the Happy Birthday song to celebrate the birthday patrons was even louder.  We waited well over our 25 minutes, but finally got our table.  The burgers were really great.  Hot, fresh and delicious toppings. The drinks were great for the value and I enjoyed people watching here.  We needed to turn on our flashlight app on our phone to read the menu.    I imagine this would be incredibly fun for a birthday celebration as you get a cup and balloon to celebrate and let everyone in the bar know it's your birthday!  I would not want to bring my kids here as there isn't a good place to wait and I know they would hate the noise.  But, food and drinks really were great and worth their value.  The service at the table was great.  Our server kept sofas full and literally hopped to his next table."}
{"text":"I have been to the Gritty plenty of times and I always check in, but have never done a review.    First of all, let's just say it--great place, great atmosphere, great food  This place is crowded at any time of day or night, and while waiting for a table you can watch sports on the tv's , or just hang and have a drink  The food has always been great and they are of course known for their great Gritty Sauce.  I have always loved their burgers, poppers, and fries, but the other day I had the Rueben Sand.  OMG. One of the most deleish things I have ever had.  If a crowded fun place with great food is your thing....then you should seek out the Grittty.  Don't let the birthday bar thing throw you off.  Yes you get a free drink, but this place is way more than just a birthday bar, and it is a two min walk to the Kohl Center!"}
