{"text":"Kathy's is one of  my regular lunch options as it is not too far of a trek from work, especially when St.Lawrence Market is closed. I always get the rotisserie chicken leg and Greek salad combo.. it tastes good, doesn't give me the 3 pm drowsies at work, and is less than $5!!! its definitely a thumbs up for me  :)  Note: Cash only!"}
{"text":"I was expecting more based on the good reviews I saw, but it was a disappointment.  I know this is a hole in the wall place and I didn't expect anything fancy - after all, it's the food that matters. However, I didn't find the food too exciting. I had the chicken leg with Greek salad. The chicken was cold and a bit too salty, and the salad was a bit bland. I do admit the price was pretty cheap, but you get what you paid for."}
{"text":"I'm not going to say much other than I used to live in a house around the corner from Kathy's with 5 other guys and they knew all of us by name.  It's 100 steps from a massive supermarket, but we rarely did groceries because we just ate at Kathy's constantly.  It was super cheap and they're really friendly.  It's just not really a great place to sit down and the options are limited.  Still, they're amazing at what they do. Too.  Much.  Goodness."}
{"text":"Quality rotisserie chicken for great value. I grab take-out from here for lunch every so often. IMO, the chicken is slightly better than Swiss Chalet/Metro, mainly because it's not covered in any mystery sauce. Portions are large, and the lunch specials are cheap. ~7$ for quarter chicken with two sides. Recommend Greek salad and roast potatoes. I don't venture much away from that. Salad is always fresh. The owners are real pleasant, and reading through the other reviews this place seems to have a story. Underrated, for sure!"}
{"text":"I live next door and literally eat here 5 days a week. Fresh rotisserie chicken made all day, great rice, potatoes and salad. All for like $5.75. I don't know a better deal in the city and the food is always fresh and the couple who owns the place is always nice and smiling.  I love Kathys and would recommend it to anyone looking for a nice balanced lunch that super cheap.  5 stars. No question."}
{"text":"A hole in the wall. Mother's cooking. Heaven for students.   This place, however unseemly the physical store is, is a god send for those who are looking for a 1) great tasting meal, 2) that is inexpensive (think under $7) 3) will fill you up (seriously their portions are so great 4) looking for a postworkout meal.   And for anyone complaining about the dry chicken, it only happens late in the evening. And that's because chicken dries fast, not their fault/methods per se. Go before 4pm and Iguarantee you it'll be as juicy and tender as can be. Even if you go after it is stil great quality."}
{"text":"Quality has dropped here since the fat old Greek man sold Kathy's to a younger couple. The chicken is still good (though I still believe his fat hands gave the food a little something extra) but the sandwich features about half the meat it used to. Still a good deal at $6.50 for a sandwich, salad and pop but no longer worth going out of your way for."}
{"text":"This area is pretty sketchy.  I guess that's why it was called Kathy's corner.. haha..  you a leg man? or breast man?  either way come down to Kathy's cause they be pimpin' chicken.   Rice, potatoes, salad, quarter chicken 5.79+taxes... all in for 6.50.    Good value for students on a budget."}
{"text":"Best bang for your buck restaurant around here! It is a carb heavy meal but their chicken leg is deeelicious with some salad to satisfy your veggie needs ;). The owners are friendly and they create a nice relationship with their customers. Definitely a go to for me when I need a quick bite on the go."}
{"text":"The chicken sandwich is ok, but this is not what most ppl are coming here for these days (I hear the sandwich was really good when the previous owner was still there, but unfortunately I didn't discover the place until after he was gone).  What you should be ordering is a quarter or half a chicken with Greek salad. The Greek salad is everything you'd expect it to be plus the patented sauce the recipe for which was invented by the old man himself, and passed down to the new owners. I don't know the ingredients and they wouldn't tell, but it has this zesty citrusy flavor that compliments the chicken in the best possible way. And the rotisserie chicken itself is oh, so good! Crispy skin, juicy meat, deliciously greasy. Mmmm...!  All in all, there's nothing fancy about this place, but the food is really good, the prices are hard to beat and the staff is very friendly.  So check it out when you're in the vicinity."}
{"text":"You get chicken, rice, taters, and salad for a very good price.  Good eats for after a workout or something to make some GAINZ.  Great price, great food especially for the down town area.  I always use hot sauce on the potatoes and rice because it can be bland otherwise (UNLESS UR INTO THAT)."}
{"text":"It has been so long that I did not come to this place. Had my quarter chicken as always and the quality of food still the same! Very consistent!"}
{"text":"Located a few steps from Ryerson,  this place is a gem because it features Uber cheap budget and healthy food right by school. An under $10 lunch"}
{"text":"Meh. Reading the other reviews, it looks like this place is an overlooked gem. It really isn't. I wanted to like it. The quantity to price ratio was very promising. $7 for a quarter chicken dinner.  There are 4 components to the quarter chicken dinner:  Chicken- Should be the star of the meal but came out too salty, dry, and old. The skin was too oily but still somewhat crispy. It's not the worst chicken I've had but it towards the lower end.   Salad- Best part of the meal. Simple Ceasar with store bought bacon bits that look like small red rocks. It was on par with what I could make at home.  Potatoes- Looked sad. Tasted mushy. They were like broiled potato slices. It is what you would imagine prison cafeteria food to be like if they made these potatoes. Simple, bland, and gray.   Rice- It was supposed to be a mushroom rice but the combination tasted odd. Not a fan. The flavouring was too suble and sort of competed with the natural rice flavor. Like the grains of rice refused to absorb the mushroom. It was also soft by hard at the same time.   I'm generally disappointed. I don't think I'll be coming back but I hope this place does well."}
{"text":"I've been a fan of Kathy's since 2005, when it was still run by it's namesake. 6 years and three owners later, I'm still a fan.  This joint is known for it's chicken, but the daily specials are also pretty good (especially the lima beans and moussaka). The place itself isn't much to look at, but quality is consistent, the chicken is roasted to perfection and for under $5 you just can't get a better lunch."}
{"text":"This place is definitely a hole in the wall! Inside out, which ever angle you look at it, this place just screams ugliness. LOL Although I really admire the old Asian couple that run this joint in no way am I cutting them any slack for the mediocre food.  Dry, dry, dry uninspiring chicken. Nothing worthy of mention here and not really worth trying either if you're on the fence. The only thing that stands out is the affordability of this place.  If you want cheap calories, go ahead!"}
{"text":"I've missed coming by here since its cash only and I often don't carry cash, so when I saw a 20 in my wallet, Kathy's it was for lunch!! The place is still the same and the food is still great. I had to bump back up to 5 stars because the food is indeed still awesome, but the plate, with 1/4 dark chicken, salad and potatoes AND a drink came to only $7.66 or something. FOR ALL THAT FOOD!? WHAT!? Fantastic!!!"}
