{"text":"Food was def on point! Got fried whiting, greens and mac and cheese! The greens and the fish stood out the most! Mac and cheese good but not great!! Greens were seasoned to perfection with a perfect hit of sweetness. Fish was rather thin in my opinion but seasoned pretty well....Their whiting is a joke compared to Mert's!! 

Nevertheless food was good and I will definately be back when Im back in the area!!"}
{"text":"Off the beaten path but well worth the trip. HUGE fan of the pork chops and mac-n-cheese. Very reasonably priced and the staff is very friendly."}
{"text":"Great friendly staff.  Would defiantly come back the next time I'm in NC.  Good food and the ice tea was delicious."}
{"text":"Let me just say that at one point in time I loved their food....more recently it's a hit or miss 
I have had to not so pleasant experiences but the yesterday was the more recent. I placed an 2 orders and the guy didn't give me my change back...I didn't realized until I back to work, so I called and got no answers, I left work to go back up there mind u my lunch hour was gone and my order was wrong  When I get there I confronted the cashier and his boss, the cashier was extremely defensive as if I accuse him of murder or something. He was bopping his head while talking and talking really inappropriate to a customer, telling me that he gave me my change. So at that time the boss comes back with my change in hand, and stated that camera showed that he didn't give me change back...So I stated that he owes me an apology for talking reckless....the cashier refused! As I explained to her that I will not patronize a black owned business like this due to fact that its ignorant people like him make it hard for businesses to succeed because word of mouth travels fast....I DONT RECOMMEND THIS RESTAURANT.....Better off going to House of Prayer!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Salt and Pepper catfish is off the chain! Came back the following day for more!  Service is so-so as they have one waitress but other than that, highly recommend!"}
{"text":"La'wan's  has the best Mac n cheese I ever had. All of there offerings are just like mama used to make. If you want some good comfort food this is the place. Fried chicken. Fantastic. Cornbread. Awesome. They always make you feel right at home too. A lot of times La'Wan comes out and greets her customers. They all treat her like family. Everyone is so nice there. I feel like they adopted me. I never leave hungry."}
{"text":"There is no better soul food restaurant in Charlotte than La'wan's. The others are imposters! Try the whiting...outstanding!!!"}
{"text":"Great food! During the week, lunch time can get a little busy (Sundays too) so call ahead for a to-go order if you're in a rush. Great service when dining in, I always feel right at home. I usually get a fish plate with mac and cheese and yams! Best. Meal. Ever! :)"}
{"text":"Outstanding food and service. A hidden gem! Huge portions. I got two giant fried pork chops with my order!"}
{"text":"Came here on a business trip. Ferman was friendly and helpful. His service was awesome. I got the catfish and it was amazing. Totally love it."}
{"text":"Great service. Food could be more complex and flavorful. Overall, the experience was nice."}
{"text":"Fried chicken is the bomb.  Place is a little divey but the food is worth it.  The sides were ok but what I expected.  I haven't tried all the local fried chicken joints yet but I will definitely be returning here.

I noticed that if you ordered 2-go food you seemed to get in and out but if you dined their it took awhile?  The buffet was pretty slim when we went so we got plates.  Chicken was great.  Cornbread was great.  Def not the mac'n cheese in town as advertised."}
{"text":"Service was great. I had salmon patties, yams, collards and cabbage. All were good. The buffet however,  was lacking. The mac and cheese was not a favorite. Just a lot of cheese over pasta. Not the way mama used to make."}
{"text":"We were in town for a conference, and this is the first place we tried for dinner.  We loved it!  
The spice on the broiled shrimp is amazing, the collard greens were perfectly cooked and flavorful, and the fried pork chops are to die for.  You gotta try these fried pork chops.  Mac and cheese, however, was a little plain-- dry and not very cheesy.  I would eat here all the time if I lived in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Look. This is Soul Food. It's not supposed to be fancy or pouring over the side of your plate. It's supposed to be made and served with love. Done. Never mind that everything tastes damn good. Chicken n Waffles, collards. Nuff said"}
{"text":"Very disappointing with the service tonight, many items were not ready and it was two hours before closing, they had one waitress doing EVERYTHING on the floor, taking orders, passing out food,  completing receipts and cleaning the tables, wAy too much work for ONE person. We could not enjoy our food due to this atmosphere."}
{"text":"I ordered a sampling of several dishes to make the $30 delivery minimum:  whiting, fried gizzards, mac and cheese side, fries, candied yams for a late night supper that I hoped to eat over a couple of days while in a hotel.  

The takeout service (not from the restaurant) delivered on time at 9:45pm, it's  now 10:15pm and as I write this the entire order except for the cornbread is in the trash, I'm not sure if its a late night quality issue, or what I ordered, but this meal was inedible, so bad I didn't even ask for my money back because I can't imagine anyone who delivered a meal like that would give a damn about what a customer thinks."}
{"text":"Steele Creek area is not where I would expect to find a good soul food restaurant, and I was not wrong. 

First of all the positives: 1) the inside was clean and spacious; 2) lunch specials are about $7.99 including 2 sides, drink and bread, which is not a bad deal. I think the buffet is priced at $9.99 for weekdays but I didn't check out the offerings as I am generally not a fan for buffets. 

We ordered from the lunch specials. I had the fried whiting fish with green bean and cabbage:  fish was underwhelming, cabbage too salty. Husband had the fried pork chop with mashed potato and rice: pork chop was overcooked and dry. He actually ordered rice and bean but got white rice instead. 

Service was kind of disorganized. Our waitress never made it back to our table after she took our orders though she didn't seem too busy as far as I could tell. It was another employee who seemed to be there overseeing things brought our food and got our drink refills once. When we finished our meal and went to check out, our waitress couldn't find our bill in their system: somehow someone else paid our bill so they had to ring it up again. 

Don't think we would be back."}
{"text":"Every time I'm in town, I have to eat at least 1 meal at La Wan's. They have the friendliest staff, the place is cleaner than any restaurant I've been in and the food... The absolute best soul food I've tasted in years.

I'm older and my taste buds aren't the best but when I eat this food I actually taste the spices in the fried chicken, the sweetness and the kick of the collard greens with pepper sauce and the cornbread is so good I can't stop eating it. Screw my diet.

This is a place that should franchise. It's that good."}
{"text":"Great place to eat! My first time trying soul food and I was not disappointed. Our waiter was great and had a good memory he didn't even have to write our order and got everything right !! Would definitely come back and eat here when I'm in town.. Mean while.. Back to CA"}
{"text":"First time customer*
Super friendly service on the phone when I called ahead to place my order. My order was ready when I arrived & the staff was SUPER cute and pleasant, despite being busy. 
Most importantly the food was delicious!! 
I had the catfish plate with Mac and cheese and cabbage, catfish was nice and crispy and seasoned well. Mac and cheese was PERFECT. & thank God, the cabbage wasn't overly salty but seasoned to perfection. Cornbread was nice soft and buttery. 
I will be back & frequently."}
{"text":"It's about the FOOD!.... really.... the location is basic strip center storefront, but THE FOOD!!!  EXCELLENT!  The staff was friendly, attentive and courteous.  But THE FOOD!  really, I liked it.  Priced right.

I had fried chicken, limas, mac and cheese, and cornbread.  Don't get no better.... and for about $9 or $10.  

Did I mention.... I liked the food???"}
{"text":"This is amongst the fullest I have been ever. Their lunch buffet has all you would expect and more. I mean they had shrimp and crawfish Cajun style on the buffet for a price that is so low I don't know how they make a profit. 
They also rotate their dishes so you have an endless variety. I thought I was done and then saw more stuff and more and ...... I think you get it. 
They had a hot sauce I have not seen before and may be homemade. Just simply delicious."}
{"text":"The service was good but the fish I had lacked seasoning. I will go back to try other foods, hopefully I will get more seasoning."}
{"text":"This was a very pleasant surprise. Started with hot wings (tasty) followed by country fried steak with mashed potatoes. It came with two sides so I got fried okra and rice & beans and an extra side of collard greens. It came with corn bread (and honey). The food was very tasty and the staff was very friendly. I was stuffed and the prices are VERY reasonable. The only drawback is that they are not open a little later. They close at 9 which is reasonable but I often work late and it would be nice to be able to pick up dinner."}
{"text":"Food is great!! We were mad we missed the buffet. Service was slow and unorganized but the food gives it 4 stars"}
{"text":"First time to Charlotte,and trying soul food.this place is the best ,customer service is on point friendly staff makes you feel right at home.The food was great .Try the pork chops grilled and the fried catfish.Will visit again."}
{"text":"Good spot for a great reasonably priced meal.

When I was in Charlotte for work I stopped here to get dinner. My coworkers and I had had a pleasant time. The staff was very friendly and nice.  All of our food was hot and we all left full.

I had grilled pork chops, macaroni and cheese, potato salad, cornbread.  I splurged and got sweet potato pie and tea.  All of it was good. I was also kind of jealous of my friend's fish dinner too which. All of our desserts were pretty good though I wish my slice of pie was just a little bit bigger.

All in all I'd be coming back next time I'm pass trough the area and I'm looking for a good meal."}
{"text":"Went in for carryout on Sunday around noon. It was quiet but full of helpful, friendly staff. Ordered fried chicken, chicken gizzards, green beans, mashed potatoes with gravy, collards, and coleslaw. Corn bread or roll offered with each meal. Food was ready in about ten or fifteen minutes, fried chicken wasn't heavy on the flour, making it very edible. Husband approved of the gizzards and wanted to get some more for dinner. Beens and potatoes were good. Collards were sweeter than typical but yum. Coleslaw had a bit more tang than usual mayo-based and was chopped. All in all, delish meal for less than $20. 

Very glad this place is just down the street from us, will be back for sure."}
{"text":"The service and food is great!!! Doesn't look like much from outside but packs a big punch with food!! Did I mention the price was great also!! Stop by this Gem when you can. I wish I could take them back to New York with me"}
{"text":"My husband and I went here today for lunch and it was immaculate. After realizing that they have a buffet on Sunday's, we opted to do that instead of ordering a meal. EVERYTHING was delicious, even down to the dessert. We will be coming back for sure!"}
{"text":"Really nice staff. Very clean, comfortable restaurant. The food was really good. I had the pork chops, the fry on it was so perfect, I may go back and get the chicken tomorrow. The greens were good and the mac n'cheese . I was lil suspect of the candied yams, cause the tasted way too much like a sweet potato pie (there is a difference) but I ate 'em. Not being from Charlotte, I didn't know what t expect, but I was pleasantly surprised. I will come back. If I had one criticism, it was hard to cut the pork chops with plastic ware...real silverware for dine in, please..."}
{"text":"The food is very good. I usually get the fried Flounder with Mac and Cheese and collards.  The Mac and cheese is very very good. My only \"complaint\" is the take out portions are very very skimpy. If you can dine in then do so. You'll get more for your money."}
{"text":"Just got through eating here after seeing several positive reviews.  I ordered the fried chicken, mashed potatoes with gravy, and cabbage. Food was as good as any You'd expect from a good country cooking place. Eating the chicken makes me never want to go back to a KFC to eat. One thing that empress me more than the food was the service and the people working there. My little boy is 4 1/2 years old and Autistic. I turned my head and he ran up to our waiter at another table and hugged him. I explained he does that sometimes and when paying up front, everyone behind the counter ask for a hug and talked to him. Made his day and mine. The staff ROCKS!!!!"}
{"text":"I had the best catfish I've had in quite some time. Perfectly fried, very tasty and fresh. In fact, I've never had a bad meal at this location or when they were across the street.  Prices very reasonable as well."}
{"text":"I eat here almost everyday for lunch and my favorite meal has to be the fried pork chops omg heaven on a plate and I always get the Mac and cheese with potato salad although the potato salad doesn't seem homemade I still enjoy it I just think of it's a soul food restaurant everything should  be made from scratch so we can really see how much soul is going into the actually dish! My only recommendation but overall this business will continue to get my money until they prove me differently and the good news is they do have a Postmates account so you can have your food delivered which is a super convenient plus! And the same staff is always nice and friendly I definitely will say go if you haven't it's worth a try in my opinion ... and I almost forgot to mention that they have a 7.99 lunch special"}
{"text":"Came down for a wedding and had one of the best soul food meals ever. Fried chicken was cooked to perfection. Great season on those collards as well. 

A must have if you need soul food that sticks to your ribs."}
{"text":"I had  fish collard greens potato salad and macaroni and cheese. The food was delicious the fish was and fresh the sides were very very good this is my second time here it just keeps getting better I love this place"}
{"text":"Sooo I had a craving for some good home cooking...and I knew for a fact it wasn't coming from my kitchen...LOL So I stopped in for a lunch special at La'Wan's and I was not disappointed!!! So I had to give it the highest rating I could because my meal was awesome!

 I had the fried porkchop, fried okra and Mac and cheese....and it almost made me forget for a moment I wasn't at home sitting at the dining room table after my mom made Sunday dinner! Mmmmmm!!!! 

The fried porkchop was crispy with delicious flavor in the seasoning, the meat was juicy and tender and it came out HOT....yummy! I've reviewed the fried okra before but trust me even if you're not a fan of okra you will love it here...the breading they use to coat it and the  freshness of the okra will have you secretly admitting that you actually have been an okra fan all your life!

And now to that mac and cheese....YUMMY! Perfect amount of cheese, pasta and flavor, I loved every bite! And again it came out hot and fresh! Add a piece of corn bread and a drink and for less than $10 you get one of the most filling and scrumptious meals you can imagine!

There is NO doubt that I will be back to enjoy this place again!"}
{"text":"The two big fried pork chops were amazing and flavorful.   There was a puddle of oil underneath, so you know that's real flava in yo mouth.  The mac & cheese were hearty and delicious - they added something (egg?) to give it some chunkiness, so its not just mac with drippy nacho cheese.  The green beans were just ok, but that was fixed with some Texas Pete's hot sauce.  The cornbread was good but small.  Prices are around $10 per plate.

Don't let the 'hood intimidate you - the folks are friendly and welcoming, although a bit slow on the service.  Its a no-frills kind of place - just tables, stackable chairs, styrofoam cups & plates, and plastic utensils.  Most of the locals get the food to go.  They proudly display their Steve Harvey Hoodie award and a signed pic of Juvenile on the wall, so you know its the realness.  And if you don't know, you better ask somebody!"}
{"text":"Fried chicken is super crispy - the skin is crunchy, not greasy - and I had the brown rice and green beans.  I ate like a king.  The staff is incredibly nice.  They accommodated my usual requests like \"gravy on the side\", etc.

When you walk in, it honestly doesn't look like much, especially in the evenings when the buffet is turned off.  It looks to be an ordinary cafeteria.  But the food is extremely tasty and a great value.  

They even cater to my biggest pet peeve - the bathrooms are spotlessly clean as is the rest of the restaurant.  

They have a side room that seats 30 people easily for a corporate lunch.  I noticed on the wall there was  a plaque submitted to them by BAM - Blacks @ Microsoft commemorating a donation drive they held there.  How cool is that?  La'Wan's is the real deal from top to bottom."}
{"text":"Ate at several soul food restaurants here in Charlotte, this place have the best customer service.   The food was great. But service and wait time is 4 stars. And they make you feel like family."}
{"text":"As soon as my party walked in we were greeted by friendly and attentive staff. They kept checking in on us and our food was brought out promptly. It was sooo delicious. And the serving size was plenty! I had the fried pork chops with mac'n'cheese, collard greens, and corn bread. A real Southern meal. It was the first time I've had collard greens and I don't regret it one bit. It was great and I'm glad I tried it. I also had the chicken tenders with the Honey Mustard sauce. Wow. The tenders were real fresh and not processed and fake like you find sometimes. And the honey mustard sauce was the best I've ever had. I honestly couldn't have asked for a better experience and I'm glad I didn't let some of these negative reviews sway my decision to try this place out. The food was great and so was the service. If you want some good home cooking, this is it. I wish I could have tried those salmon cakes, but maybe next time!"}
{"text":"When you walk into La'Wan's there is a poster of a martini glass with a chicken leg in it. Now this makes me chuckle.  Our server was so friendly and always a step ahead of us.  He's the kind that if you have a restaurant you want to steal him away.  

The food does not rock my soul, but it is served hot and plentiful.  And it's really nice  when we were leaving they all said good bye.  Very refreshing to have such a pleasant experience.  We get used to mediocre service and forget about what it's like to have proper hospitality.

The menu is standard meat and two veggies, pintos, lima, collards, mac & cheese, potato salad, mashed potatoes.  Roll or cornbread.  Sweet tea. Ten dollar check average."}
{"text":"Food was hot and delicious.  Small little dive for a quick bite.  Friendly customer service"}
{"text":"Good food, good people. Astera handled her business. Im full, nap time..lol...They are at the location now 7520 s.tryon"}
{"text":"3 of us for Saturday evening dinner. Dine in. 
Service ran off the tracks. Took over ONE hour to get our food!  Like they forgot about us.  People who arrived after us got served, dined & left before we got served.

Came in stages. Had fried pork chops, grilled shrimp & fried shrimp. Brought sides for fried shrimp, but no shrimp or cornbread. Finally shrimp arrived. No cornbread. Had to yell at waiter about it.
Sides for grilled shrimp, greens were cold. Waiter brought a lil extra.
They said our order of fried shrimp was given to another cuatomer by mistake. But they we're holding rest of our order to try to serve together.

Besides chilled supposedly fresh made food, flavor was good.

Waiter offered to comp fried shrimp, but cashier did not. 

Promises, promises....

Let us know how ur visit goes..."}
{"text":"Food was good but could have used some more seasoning. I ordered the beef tips nd rice with onions and peppers"}
{"text":"I ate here the same day I tried Nana's Soul Food....I just got a veggie plate from here...I must say the food was just ok....it's very much over priced. If you're looking for some good soul food I would choose Nana' s over this over priced store front restaurant. My veggie plate was $7.88 with just 3 vegetables,  cabbage, mac cheese fried okra. I didn't get anything to drink with this..Now granted the food was hot and the taste was ok...but it was nothing different from other soul food restaurants. Next time I want a veggie plate I'll go to  the Roasting Company can get 4 veggies for 5.59 and its prepared healthier... I don't know how they came up with their outrageous price points for that little bit of food they give.  But this is typical for some AA businesses."}
{"text":"Adrienne was the one who took our orders and helped us! 
We came here for the first time while Visiting North Carolina from California. 
Since I was in NC I had to try the peach cobbler, corn bread and cole slaw! 
I loved the food! 
Staff is friendly! 

We thought we were suppose to order at the counter, than pay and go sit and eat but because we came on a very busy Sunday morning after church, it was so packed. 
Guess, someone is suppose to sit you down! 
Well, I liked the southern soul food very much! 

Parking is easy to find, location is good! 

Thanks! 
We enjoyed ourselves here!"}
{"text":"Lawan's fluctuates between stars for me.....the food is very good, but lately the seasoning has been a little off on the fish and chicken....still good and cooked perfectly, but not as great as it has been.  The sides are still delish(mac n cheese, okra, greens and potato salad).  If I were closer to the south side, they would be in my rotation, so for now they will have to remain on my 'special occasion/coupon' list:-)"}

{"text":"I've only been here once and never again.  If you order a pork chop sandwich, the last thing you expect is for the pork chop to have a bone and at a bare minimum, it should at least be warm."}
{"text":"I'm so displeased with their Mac and cheese I paid almost 7 dollars for a large with was so small and if was a mushy mess never again will I get it !!"}
{"text":"Beef tips with peppers and onions was very, very good. Mac and cheese was not award-worthy in my opinion yet better than many others I have had. Needed a little more salt and flavor. Collards were ok. Need to try the chops and chicken...if I return. Feel like Nana's Soul Food is better."}
{"text":"I knew I was back down south when I saw pig feet on the buffet. lol I decided to order off the menu instead. I got the catfish, greens and mac and cheese and cornbread. The catfish was alright and I say that because I am not a fan of having it battered only on corn meal.  The greens were fine but needed salt and who ever plated them could have drained the juice off. I had no complaints on the mac and cheese and I am very picky when it comes to that. Oh, and the sweet tea was on point. Our server came to check on us regularly and was friendly."}
{"text":"From all of the reviews I expected something that would taste out of this world.  My mother and I ordered food. She had baked chicken, I the fried chicken. Neither one of us was pleased with the entree or the sides. Not sure how the Mac n cheese could receive such good reviews. How is this soul food? I will not return."}
{"text":"Grabbed a couple lunch specials to take to my husband for Valentine's Day.  The staff was friendly, and courteous.  They were just finishing up my order when I got there. It was our first time eating here, and I would highly recommend it.  Our fried chicken was hot and crispy, the potato salad was amazing and I ate the BEST collard greens ever, I didn't even need to add anything to them.  Next time I want to try the Buffet bar!"}
{"text":"Pretty good food, at reasonable prices, sometimes takes a little long to get out but for the most part is good ol southern style cooking. I like the turkey and the corn bread is good southern corn bread that's sweet, only way to really eat corn bread if your from the south. Sweet tea is SWEET TEA the way it should be, service I'm not fond about, the front girls don't really seem to want to be there and they are in the terms I guess I can say ghetto lol just in the way they talk and how they give service is not really up to par in the service industry."}
{"text":"The first time I ever went to La'Wan's I was excited, I assumed I had stumbled upon a good place. On my last visit I placed an order to be picked up on my 45 minute lunch break. I was told 20 minutes...they took longer. I ended up having less than 10 minutes to inhale the food, with them only being 5 minutes away from my job. It was nasty. I ordered a shrimp and fish combo plate (about $17) with 2 sides. My fish was plain, I had 4 cold shrimp, my mac & cheese was swimming in oil and the greens was okay (might have been the cause of the toilet visits the next day). I ended up forcing the mac and cheese down my throat so that I could finish my 12 hours shift. I kept the remaining part of the plate and took it back the next day.
I spoke to a gentlemen who was okay with refunding my money until he opened the tray. He asked me where the mac and cheese was? I explained to him I ate it in hunger but it was disgusting. Due to it being missing he then told me that he could only refund half my tray....it was $17 bucks and because I could only eat the mac and cheese you want to deny me a full refund...uhhh okay...the logic being??? Then got the nerve to ask when did I come in...around 8-9 pm his response was \"well I was cooking then, I fixed this tray, it wasn't nasty\" and you know this how? Did you taste my food? And because you were cooking do you think you can't produce nasty food? Since then I have not been back, completely upset at the audacity of this man. To be honest I've heard a lot of complaints since they have moved across the street. Go back to the hot box and lower your prices, because you got ridiculous and nasty once you crossed the street!!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has a great variety of food on the buffet and it all taste well. The salad, fruit, and dessert were all good. My family all had the buffet. The least liked dish was the Crawfish dish. The staff was pleasant and the lady that took care of our table had a pleasant attitude and ensured our plates were cleared from the table and our cups were filled with our drink of choice. If we had one suggestion, please add coffee to the menu."}
{"text":"Food is over cooked and mushy. Came in for some dressing (some ppl call it stuffing but it's dressing in the south) and it came with this ecru colored gravy on top of a mushy blob of I guess dressing. No texture other than soft was in this dish. 

Not a fan and will not be back"}
{"text":"Was recommended this soul food place. Glad that I went. I ordered the fried wings with collards and max&cheese. The collards were seasoned really well and the taste wasn't overbearing which I liked. The wait time was about 20 minutes. This was my first time coming. If I return I'll probably call ahead. Other than that Was great and cooked to perfection. The service was also great. The waitresses let you know the status of your food order. Some places you'll sit and wait and they just ignore you. Not here. Great customer service skills."}
{"text":"The food here was alright. I ordered fried grouper, yams and greens but didn't eat it all. This was my first time here recommended by a friend who sat across from me eating catfish. His plate was looking all full, tasty and plentiful while I had all that space on my plate lol (I heard that's a healthy look). The ONE piece of grouper was seasoned and fried very well but that's all I really enjoyed. The greens were a little bitter and the yams mushy but the price was ok. I can't say that I'll return here but it seems to be a popular place where many locals visit and take out.  I don't have much more to say because I didn't have much on my plate to review lol. So that's all folks...."}
{"text":"Winner - Best Macaroni and Cheese I have ever eaten! !! !!!  5 stars for the Mac and Cheese with EASE!  Rich and Cheesy baked with Egg (I think), this is the best one I have tasted ANYWHERE! 

The Collards were very good at least 4 yelp stars probably cooked with some kind of meat and Vinegar!

The Fried Okra was better than most I have eaten - the batter was thin, though more grainy than I prefer, still beats most places!

The Corn Bread was: Smooth and a little Sweet, just like I like it (NOT having that grainy cornmeal texture) - the flavor was good or a little better than good, though a little disappointing! Still good enough for 3.65 yelp stars! 

I ate Lunch here yesterday 5-14-2012 and they had not moved yet!  They said hopefully a week!  I drove by their new place first (in the brand NEW Family Dollar Shopping Center almost across the street and a little North (up the hill) on Tryon).  This new space they are almost in looks great: Clean and New and larger - Hopefully it will retain the Charm of the old place!"}
{"text":"While they do serve straight up soul food, the soul food is not good. It's flavorless and unmemorable. I've had much better fried chicken at Bojangles down the street. Now that's saying a lot."}
{"text":"LaWan's is the best soul food I have had anywhere hands down. It's bare bones in a strip shopping center but worth a special trip to go there. My favorite is fried chicken, mac & cheese, & collards, also banana pudding. She also does catering at a reasonable price. I definitely recommend LaWans!"}
{"text":"Food is okay, but staff is extremely rude. Went in on a Saturday afternoon and the young lady at the register  didn't even greet me and then when I asked her about a menu item, she gave me much attitude. It's more places in Charlotte with better soul food in addition to great customer service. They have loss my business. Customer Service is everything."}
{"text":"Great food! Wonderful service!!! The prices don't really match the serving portion but the foods delicious, especially the catfish!"}
{"text":"I'm at work discussin' lunch options with a buddy - he and another buddy tried this place before and liked it. It's near work and so off we go. It has not so great curb appeal but, I'm not trying to live there. The food is so good. I deduct one star from the sticker shock. The price is a bit high. Oh the customer service is great - very nice folks here."}
{"text":"Fried fish, coupled with some fried okra hot cornbread and a splash of hot sauce for good measure equals peaceful nap.... #knockedcoldout"}
{"text":"BEST ARNOLD PALMER OF MY LIFE!

small joint with everything fried and all the home fixin's you could ask for. We sat down and dined in, very low key/casual. The wait for the actual food was hard to bear but totally worth it once it came out.

We went right at noon and were the first ones in the place, which was a good thing because it got pretty full a few moments later. Many people also came into grab 'to go' orders so the staff was definitely busy in the back!

My brother got - Fried Pork Chops with green beans / fried okra 
**If I were to redo my food, I'd get THAT! the green beans were unimaginably good, cooked with pork/bacon. Fried okra, hadn't had it in forever so it was AMAZING

I got  Fried Chicken (dark meat) with mac/cheese and collard greens. The collard greens were a bit sweet, my brother said it was the best collard greens he had ever had (and he's not even a big fan of collard greens!). The mac and cheese was baked (just the way I like it with baked cheese on top). The chicken, delightful, but can't say it was anything CRAZY GOOD.

My friend got the fried catfish with fried okra and mashed potatoes. The catfish was fried to perfection and the inside was still very moist. Forgive me, but I think I decided I'm not the biggest catfish fan but his was still delicious! I unfortunately did not try the mashed potatoes, but I'm sure they were fabulous!

Every dish came with a small cornbread, which was perfectly moist and buttery. Again, I love the salty cornbread more so this was a little sweet for my liking, but it was still amazing.

In the end for our three meals, it came to about $37 and then add tip, so NOT BAD AT ALL. We were FILLED to the brim and with DELICIOUS FOOD AT THAT.

Can't wait to go back when I get back home! And next time I'm going to try to save some room for dessert, many of the 'to go' orders had mounds of cake slices and they looked friggin' delicious!

La'wan, so glad I found y'all! :)"}
{"text":"Food was ok. Read reviews about best fried chicken so wanted to try. Having eaten fried chicken at Nana's and Mama dips, was expecting something along those lines.  Greens and cornbread were ok. Yams were the best thing in the plate.  Staff was very personable."}
{"text":"Nothing really great about this place. The atmosphere  seemed  nice . However,  everything  is else is average. The world famous pork chop was far from famous. The greens  tasted like they just pulled it out fresh water . There was absolute  no salt or any spices added.  The potatoe salad was actually  the best thing . I wouldn't  waste my money here ever again."}
{"text":"Horrible!!!! Be ware of food poisoning....I ordered 10 piece of chicken, thighs, legs and wings.  It came with rolls (the rolls were really good).... I paid $28.00 for chicken with rolls and even though I thought that was pretty pricy I figured for that price the chicken would be on point.

I was soooo wrong!!!!  This is the worst chicken I've ever had, had me wait 20 min for the chicken so I thought it would be fresh. I was wrong again, chicken was room temperature and had been sitting out so long that the meat was so dried out I couldn't even chew it. And they did not give me the chicken I asked for, no wings and thiee were breast meat instead of thighs.  I basically paid almost $30.00 for some bread rolls because that was the only thing edible.

I was really hungry so I tried to find pieces of chicken that were chewable, I maybe had 5 bites of their chicken that were chewable out of the 10 pieces I bought. The next day my stomach was feeling kinda off, almost a week later my stomach is still a mess. I would have been better off with kfc or even Gass station chicken, I'm not sure how this place is staying in business. I had food from this place years back when I use to live on that side of town and they had good wings, candied yams and greens, really good!  Alots changed in those few years unfortunately 

I called while still in the parking lot and complained about the chicken being nasty and she had someone call me about 20 min later after I was just pulling up at my house to tell me I could return the chicken for fresh chicken or get a refund but I did not wanna waist anymore of my time being it was going on 9pm.  If they would have just gave me fresh chicken from the start?  No one was even eating in that restaurant when we waited 20 min for the order of old dried out chicken.

Don't waist your time or money"}
{"text":"I've been meaning to try La'Wan's for a long time and I'm glad I did. They have a small buffet for lunch and it's delicious! I started with a salad. Then sampled the other choices. I LOVE the greens! They are the only thing I got twice!"}
{"text":"The food here is bussin'. I love this place"}
{"text":"What is to say good. Slick floors, bad behavior, rude. Slow, unprofessional expensive. If the food comes then I will rate that"}
{"text":"Saw some reviews online and thought I'd check it out.  As you walk in, the staff greets you.  They are very friendly.  The server explained the menu to me and  I ordered the fish, yams, mac and cheese.  it was great! my only problem was it was not enough food...lol... I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Wherever I rest my head, I must find the best southern food in my area. The best fried chicken to be specific. While driving around, La'Wan's was the closest spot so I figured I'd give it a try. The chicken itself deserves 4.5 stars. Been a while since I had fried chicken that good. Well seasoned, flaky breading and a juicy taste when you sank your teeth in. Two thumbs up. I also tried their fried catfish and that was pretty good as well.

The sides were sorta hit or miss. Nothing terrible but nothing that stood out. I did enjoy their mac and cheese but who messes up mac and cheese? Service is a little slower than I'm accustomed to but after four pieces of chicken and a slew of sides, I wanted to be left alone anyway. Perhaps that's the point."}
{"text":"I had 4 chicken wings, cabbage and the best macaroni in town! And let's not forget the peach cobbler and sweet tea! Awesome meal. I ate on it twice. If was more than enough for one serving!"}
{"text":"We live in northern Colorado where there is no soul food. When searching for restaurants near our hotel, I found La'Wans. They have fried livers! And fried gizzards! Pork chops, chicken fried steak and catfish! And collard greens! We ordered way too much food but just had to try the livers, gizzards, pork chops and catfish. It did not disappoint! Everything was seasoned perfectly and the portions are GENEROUS. 
We were the only ones dining in around 7pm for dinner but they had a constant stream of take-out customers. They have a buffet at lunch. You won't leave hungry. 
We think folks in North Carolina are some of the friendliest people on earth... and at La'Wans they make you feel right at home. We had the sweetest server who was so attentive. And towards the end of dinner, the owner came and introduced himself with and handshake and a huge smile. 
We can't wait to return to Charlotte... we will come back to La'Wans!"}
{"text":"3.5

This place was pretty good. I was craving for some southern fried chicken and this place definitely fit that bill. The chicken was delicious and the skin was fried perfectly. The only thing was that the food took awhile to come out.

Seems like a lot of people get take out. I wasn't too thrilled that the workers didn't ask me if I wanted a refill on my drink and I had to go up and get it myself. It probably took 30 mins to get the food. Kind of crazy if you think about it since all I got was fried chicken. But based off of the fried chicken and just that I am definitely a fan. 

This place puts Roscoes to shame. We in Los Angeles are so deprived of good soul food."}
{"text":"Really good food here. Very consistent. Friendly service. I have come here server all times and I've always been pleased with the level of service I receive.  I don't know the owner but I am proud to call this place my neighborhood soul food spot."}
{"text":"Delicious pork chops! Collards. Mac 'N Cheese. Sweet Tea. Friendly."}
{"text":"Explore better management besides your family! $18 for overcooked pork chops collard greens and yams! Damn I miss Buffalo New York food."}
{"text":"The buffet bar was dirty, the food looked dried out and the plates weren't clean. That's was my first visit. On the second one the buffet wasn't open so I was gonna order from the menu but changed my mind because the menu was dirty too. Food particles all over...... eww"}
{"text":"Went there for their buffet and was extremely disappointed, this is the worst buffet I have ever had. For the price that they charge ($17.99, soft drinks not included), there was very little to choose from on the buffet.  The turkey wings were very dry, the stew beef was too salty and there was no gravy for the rice we had to add some from the stew beef. The collard green were loaded with sugar and spicy hot. There wasn't even a soup to choose from. My husband and I asked for bread because there was none on the buffet and they brought us one roll and one corn muffin.  We later had to ask for more bread and again one for each of us was brought over. Now the dessert bar, all I can say is really, it was all store brought cake and cookies. They're calling this a soul food restaurant and serving store brought desserts. We were presented with the check and realized that there was a charge on there for the extra bread. Are they serious? A $20 buffet and you're charged for extra bread. Since when do you offer a buffet and no bread?  When I inquired about it they did us a favor and took one roll off. Well I guess you can gather from this post that I will never ever eat there again. I wanted to give them a lower rating but one is the lowest. They lucked out!"}
{"text":"Been searching for a good soul joint since moving to CLT. Unfortunately, the search continues. The food, the portions (fish, in particular), for the price...leaves much to be desired."}
{"text":"Food was ok. Not as good as Nana's Restaurant. It was very over priced. It was a bit devoid of flavor: I had to douse my chicken, greens, and mac n cheese with Frank's Red Hot. Greens were too sweet. There was no \"umph\" in the mac n cheese: they should use a better quality cheese (maybe some gruyere) and less egg."}
{"text":"I'm always on the lookout for your basic meat and 2/3 restaurant so when I saw La'Wan's in a strip shopping center on South Tryon, I thought I'd give it a try. The service was immediate and attentive. They have a buffet and a menu from which to order. I chose the buffet because I wanted some vegetables. Although the food tasted fine, the buffet is very limited in choices: salad, cabbage, fried chicken and a couple of other choices. This would have been OK except that they charged over $9.00 for it. If I go back, I should probably choose from the menu."}
{"text":"this place is ok. to me the portions are smaller than i would like but i do think the food is ok. And the staff are awesome. Always upbeat and friendly. i have had 2 bad experiences here. 1 time i ordered a chicken salad and i couldnt enjoy it because i just did not care for their house seasoning and the chicken was heavily dressed in it before they fried it. The 2nd time i ordered a fish sandwich and i was extremely disappointed I think it was a whiting sandwich and i expected 2 crispy fried pieces of fish  or 1 peice of fish cut in half. What i got was some miscellaneous bits of fish that were limp and under cooked. The fish was not opaque and i was very upset that i got uncooked fish in these strange pieces. They were literally like all broken up and halfway assembled on the sandwich. some were the size of a quarter, some pieces were the size of a potato chip, i could go on but this puzzle piece fish sandwich fell short and i think its clear. 

But it's not all bad. At this point i am not against going to lawans but i wont pay for their lame buffet with like 5 menu items or dinner plates or desserts which can be like $4 for 1 piece of cake. I only get porkchops. lol a porkchop lunch special or a porkchop sandwich. everything else is a no from me dawg...."}
{"text":"Can beat the place. Food served with heart. Clean place. Go for it. You can't be disappointed. All Good."}
{"text":"I waited approximately 25 minutes for Fried chicken, fried okra, and green beans. Now I will admit that that probably was an accurate wait time for all of that fried food but I was ready to eat !!! Chicken wings were fried really well ( A light batter that was not hard ) but lacked seasoning, I consider them southern style but not soul food style because they tasted average.  There Wasn't a Particular seasoning that stuck out and made the chicken soulful. On the flipside, at least the chicken was not too salty. Their Side item serving sizes are  what the typical restaurant gives you.   My roll reminded me of the Hawaiian bread but without the sweetness. It was Warmed and thick but definitely not anything different from what you can buy a grocery store.  It was not particularly bad but the food did not stand out for me. The cashier was very flat and could work on her professionalism. The restaurant is clean and has ample parking. Maybe I'll give them another try in a few weeks."}
{"text":"Four of us had lunch here today after a 3 day visit to Charlotte for New Years! It was the perfect end to our trip!  The service was excellent and all of the food followed suit!!
We tried a little bit of everything, the Collards, macaroni and cheese, green beans, cabbage, fried chicken, salt and pepper catfish, the grilled turkey rib's and livers and gizzards. All of the food was superb and was flavored to perfection!!  We will definitely stop again on our next visit Charlotte!!
One of my friends does not eat pork and he was very pleased to see that there was many items on the menu he could eat!"}
{"text":"I love to be able to walk into a place and get mgreat southern soul food, amazing customer service and quick turnaround on my food. I am more of a carry out person but from what I hear the dining experience is great too!"}
{"text":"Great food and customer service. I dined in on a Sunday afternoon and was pleased to find only a small gathering of people. My entree came out fresh and hot. The timing was a little longer, but I realized it was cooked at the time of my order. I appreciated getting fresh food. Southern cooking at its best. I'll be back again soon"}
{"text":"Just walked out after I stood on the side counter to take a look at their Menu for a few minutes and when decided to walk in front of the counter waited several minutes and several staff saw me but never acknowledged my presence, let's keep in mind I was the only one standing there. Small place, there where a few tables but none available. Disappointed due to poor customer service, as I walked out noticed several of their staff outside smoking and on their cell phone. Will never return to this place, will not recommend."}
{"text":"I have heard a few good things about La Wans, and finally decided to give it a shot. 3 friends and I went in on sunday afternoon and it took 55 minutes to be served fried food. 55 minutes! 
We were on the verge of walking out when the server came over and said it will be right out. 
The server was friendly, when he was there, but that wasn't often. 

Over priced with bad service..... save yourself some trouble and go to Zaxbys"}
{"text":"I just love the food here. Always delicious. My favorite is the Salt and Pepper catfish, with collards and mac and cheese, but I am sure you will find your favorite as well."}
{"text":"Three ppl ordered after me. And all for their food before me. Lady at the register (Mia)simply said she doesn't know why the orders are coming out backwards and offered no kind of compensation for it. Asked for a refund cuz the food was taking so long and she was quick to agree with that. Seems she's rather lose the sale rather then try and satisfy the customer some way shape or form. Sweet girl though. No customer service skill. Then asked for a manger to see if they were able to right the wrong. 
Kenny came out and offered my next meal to be on him for the mix up and simply wrote his cell number down on a business card. Don't know if he'll remember what he verbally agreed upon the next time I come in but the gesture was greatly appreciated. 

Food was absolutely AMAZING though. Four stars because the service is just as important as the taste.

Went back a second time and ordered the chitterlings. Really nice taste. Clean, seasoned just right, it came with white rice and I got doubled collards this time and it came with a really nice buttered piece of cornbread that was SO yummy!"}
{"text":"It has been years (perhaps even decades) since I've been to La'Wan's for some of her soul food. In fact, it's been so long, they aren't even in the same place, and the place where they are now didn't even exist then. Well, the place did, but the building didn't. Oh, you know what I mean.

So they've moved across the street and into some nicer - and significantly larger - digs. But I don't know that it really helped all that much. I mean it does provide a lot more space, I will give you that, but it doesn't necessarily equate to a better experience.

The staff at La'Wan's is top-notch - some of the friendliest that you'll ever meet. The food, while good, and definitely up there, was probably better at the other place, and while that may be seen through rose-colored glasses remembering the hole-in-the-wall that used to be, it's still quite good, and worth a visit.

If you stop in for the Sunday buffet, watch out for the church crowd. They might be dressed in their Sunday finest, but they go after that mac and cheese like nobody's business."}
{"text":"Me and wifey have eaten here a couple times before and after they moved. Food is decent, nothing to write home about. This is a good place to eat when you don't feel like cooking or don't want fried food smell in your house. A little pricey IMO but what restaurant isn't? Try them out, you'll probably go back after trying them."}
{"text":"I guess the food was good enough. Everything was fried and creamy but I expected that. The catfish on the buffet was sub par. The corn bread was pretty good. Almost all the chicken on the buffet was wings and they had some good flavors. Pasta salad was nothing special. All in all, if you like Soul food, then you will like this place, otherwise skip it and go for something you know is reliable."}
{"text":"I have gone to Lawans for several years. The food has always been hit or miss but I must admit that despite all of my hit and miss encounters the macaroni and cheese has always been the best that I've had in Charlotte which is the reason I would return after not so great encounters. However as much as I like to support small locally owned businesses, my last encounter was my finally visit to LaWans. I order baked chicken, not only was it undercooked but it was bloody. This was not noticeable until I started to eat the chicken.  I understand that mistakes do happen so before posting on Yelp, I attempted to reach out to the owner/management; months later and still no response. I can not continue to support a business whether small and locally owned or not if the owners/managers of the business do not value customer service."}
{"text":"I can see why this place has great reviews. It was really nice to see how the waiter was very attentive.  He was constantly checking with the tables and you could tell he really cared. On to the food: I ordered the grilled pork chops. The seasoning was great and they tasted really good.  I have to admit that almost everything on the menu was fried, but together with the cabbage and green beans which were not greasy, I felt like my meal was pretty healthy."}
{"text":"One of my favorite soul food places in Charlotte! The lunch buffet always has a variety of dishes from sides to desserts so you'll definitely get your money's worth. The staff is always wonderful and attentive. The mac and cheese is to die for."}
{"text":"Very good southern food like promoted. I really enjoyed my chicken livers and my boyfriend enjoyed his food though I forget what he got. My tip though is to be prepared to wait for the food and also do not eat the buffet tbh did not feel like it was worth it and the sanitation around the buffet made me gag."}
{"text":"Great food, great service. Had the smothered pork chop, mac and cheese, mashed potatoes and gravy, and candied yams. Came with a side of cornbread. 

We will absolutely return!"}
{"text":"Lawan's has an awesome staff great customer service the food is delicious just like Grandma or mom was making it in the kitchen the smoked grilled pork chops where mouth-watering good homemade macaroni and cheese was amazing good portions good price"}
{"text":"The food is great. One of the best soul places to go to in Charlotte. The food was salty the last time I went there but anyway, try the cabbage and chicken."}
{"text":"It pains me to provide a less than positive review of this place, however, it is necessary. Visited LaWan's on a Saturday, mid-afternoon. I ordered fried fish (Croaker which is $3 more than whiting) with no sides or drink and the total was about $7.50. Service wasn't expedient but not awful. After navigating a physical fight in the parking lot that included LaWan employees, I drove 30 mins to my home and it was then that I discovered ONE piece of fish in my container -- a piece of fish that was smaller than the palm of my hands -- which are fairly small -- minus the tail and fins. I called the restaurant to confirm what I was charged for and apparently ONE piece of SMALL fish will set you back about $7 bucks. The taste was decent but needless to say I will not return to this establishment or refer anyone else. There are just too many other options."}
{"text":"Awesome food. I'm not going to lie!
Best grilled seasoned chops and green beans, Mac and cheese soul style. I love the enviroment, calm and clean. The young lady who was our host was super polite and helpful when explaining the specials. Keep up the great work LaWans"}
{"text":"Now , let's keep in mind it's tough to judge a good southern soul food meal , depending on where you grew up in the south , taste will vary . 

La Wan's is on the top of the list for delicious soul food , our waiter was extremely funny and on top of his game . My coworker and I went at 11:30 not too early not wrapped up in the hectic lunch crowd . 

I noticed the buffet , at $9.99, it appeared to be a good deal, small salad bar, fried chicken, collards, green beans, Mac & cheese ,  smothered chicken , rice , etc. It's not your extravagant buffet , but it's the classic dishes . I ordered off the large menu , there were many options even \"Healthier \" food dishes like grilled chicken tenders , broiled shrimp , grilled tilapia, etc . , but I ordered the fried wings with a side of collards and Mac & cheese .

The wings were seasoned simple, just enough seasoning to satisfy your fried chicken cravings , what I loved is that they weren't heavily breaded. The Mac and cheese was delicious, it was your basic baked macaroni and cheese . The collards , I loved , normally I put vinegar on mine , but I don't feel La Wan's needed it , they were cooked just right with the right amount of flavor . 

I will definitely go back and try the grilled food options, can't say I've had better soul food from the other places I've visited in Charlotte, nice to find a place that  delivered that  soul food experience ."}
{"text":"Hello friends, 

I finally made my way here. The place is very clean, airy, & spacious. They offer a buffet for what I believe 14 or 15 bucks. That's actually seems like the best deal if there is one. I spent 21 bucks on 1 piece of fish, and 2 sides NO drink. 

Yes, read that last part again. The food was pretty good nonetheless however for 21 bucks I shoulda got a back message as well. 

I can't really fault them because the prices are listed and I chose to order it but........

I may return again if I can find a coupon or get a pay raise I couldn't imagine taking a family of 3+."}
{"text":"Best fried chicken anywhere. This place has always been a go-to spot for me and my coworkers on lunch break. 

Their new location makes the experience even better! It's very clean and the staff are extremely friendly. 

Definitely a hidden gem in the Charlotte area."}
{"text":"Best fried chicken I've had in the area. Workers were super nice and helpful. Only reason I gave 4 instead of 5 is I thought the sides were just ok."}
{"text":"VISIT ONE: It was good for what it was. I'm pretty sure my fried chicken is better. Service is friendly and accommodating. The side of fries were good, Cole slaw ok, little cornbread muffin was hard and dry. Chicken was juicy and tender. Skin was crispy, but just nothing to brag about. I'd probably go back for lunch.

UPDATE: I went for lunch and won't be going back.  The \"buffet\" was sad and pathetic. They only had a few things that didn't look appetizing. No crab as advertised. The Smothered Chicken was SUFFOCATED in a sad excuse for gravy that was watery and tasteless. I don't know where they get their chicken, because it is the scrawniest, boniest birds I've ever had . I barely had any chicken, mostly skin. Trust me. There ain't no soul in THIS place!"}
{"text":"I came here with my brother it just happened to be his birthday night.  and we were really happy with our food I had the chicken wings with potato salad and it was really good. I also had the lemon cake. now I should have known better because I'm a baker than to order other ppls sweets. I thought it was a layered lemon cake but instead it was a pound cake that was cooked a little to long so the edges were a little just a little burnt. Over all my experience here was god the corn bread was good but the potato salad and chicken will have me coming back."}
{"text":"Went here a couple of weeks back with my daughters and my mom. Overall the food was just ok. I ordered fried chicken and with okra and so did my daughters. Again, it was ok, nothing to write home about. 

What stands out the most is the service we received. Our waiter was most attentive, cheerful and probably one of the better waiters I've had recently. Kudos to that guy.

Now, my biggest problem with La'Wan's was its pricing. For what it is, it seems excessively priced."}
{"text":"Consistency, consistency, CONSISTENCY! I've been coming here for a while now, even though I'm not super local. Every single time I know exactly what to expect! The food is always amazing, the service is always professional but fun, the music is always lit lol, I just love it! It's a little pricey to me but you definitely get what you pay for."}
{"text":"I hate I did not have any pictures to capture the experience. 

Service - 3
Food - 5
Price - 5
Portions - 5
Interior - 4

Service earned the rating because the waiter assumed I called the restaurant 'ghetto.' It was literally the first thing he said before asking what would I like to order. I was pretty annoyed by the first impression because he made an assumption when I hadn't even mustered a word to him. The service improved by the end of dinner. However, it's a lasting impression.

Otherwise, the food certainly earned 5 stars! I haven't had good quality soul food cooking in Charlotte until this restaurant. I have heard of a few to try; however, this one did not make the list and I wish it would. 

You certainly get bang for your buck! I'm not a fan of the buffet bar; however, if re-order cabbage and BBQ turkey ribs everyday from this place if I lived nearby."}
{"text":"Heard so much about the place, I thought I would check out. The staff is friendly. It's in a strip mall but it's not a bad area. They have a buffet but didn't start until after we go there. May check out next time. I got the chicken with yams, greens, and mac and cheese. My friend go the catfish. The catfish was seasoned really well and so was the chicken. It wasn't too crispy at all. Just perfect. The mac and cheese was my favorite!! Absolutely amazing!! The other sides were okay. The cornbread was a little cold but still good. Great place to check out."}
{"text":"Sometimes, you just want fried chicken. And you don't want to get it at the fast food joint. When that craving strikes you, give La'Wan's a shot.

While the ordering situation was initially confusing... do I seat myself? do I order at the counter? ... it straightened out quickly. Yes, seat yourself. Yes, someone will bring a menu and take your drink order. There's also a buffet table, but I skipped that today.

A few minutes later, I had a quarter of white meat chicken set down in front of me. The chicken was really excellent. Lots of meat, not a lot of batter, not too greasy at all. The mac & cheese lived up to the sign out front (\"Best in the Queen City\") with lots of cheesiness inside and a good topping of toasted cheese. Maybe not as good as *my* mac & cheese, but certainly some of the best that I've had away from my own kitchen. The cole slaw had the right consistency and texture, but I found the pickle relish taste to be overpowering. No worries, to each his own.

Service was excellent. My water was refilled as needed, I was checked on as needed and there was a squeezy bottle of Texas Pete on the table for some bite.

Really good chicken and great service. Yum!"}
{"text":"Based on the reviews I expected so much more. The catfish dinner comes with one small fillet. The fried chicken had flavor but the portions didn't match the pricing. The sides were disgusting macaroni and cheese was cold and dry with barely melted cheese on top no cheese throughout. The yams had no flavor and the collard greens tasted like canned Glory Collard greens. I don't mind paying for quality food but this definitely wasn't it."}
{"text":"No, this isn't the place to satisfy your craving for orange chicken.  It is, however, simply southern; exactly as advertised.

La'Wan's offers a small buffet and a full menu.  Fried chicken, fried shrimp, fried tilapia, fried catfish.  Notice a theme here?  The typical southern soul sides include collard greens, green beans, mashed potatoes, mac-n-cheese...the list goes on.  

I stopped in for a late lunch.  The place wasn't too busy, but I imagine I missed the bulk of the lunch crowd.  The service was lacking.  I waited longer than I should've to place my order, and it took entirely too long to receive my food.  Had I been there during the lunch rush, I'd likely have walked out before ever receiving my meal.

My order consisted of fried salt and pepper catfish, fried shrimp, green beans, and mac-n-cheese.  The mac-n-cheese was good, but I've had better.  The green beans were simply prepared with no seasoning whatsoever.  The shrimp were perfect, and the cocktail sauce was amazing!  I'm not sure if it's made in-house or not, but it had just the right kick!  The catfish was rather bland.  It could have used more of the salt and pepper that the menu boasted.  The tarter sauce was dill heavy.  Again, I'm not sure if the sauce was prepared in-house.  Both sauces were served in pre-portioned togo ramekins; which makes me think it's an in-house job.

Once the waitress finally reappeared, I asked what they had to offer for dessert options.  She had already dropped my check by the table and made no attempt to up-sell me on anything else.  I decided to give the banana pudding a go.  It was plopped in front of me in a plastic togo container that came straight from the fridge.  It was banana-ful, but the wafers were mushy and it was too cold.  Just removing the lid made a mess of the whipped topping.

The waitress never came back after that.  Another employee (possibly a manager/owner) came by and grabbed my check and credit card.  It's the kind of place where you would usually take the check up to the counter to pay, but they offered to go ahead and run my card for me since they saw it out on the table.

Overall, I think this place does southern fried soul fairly well.  I'd go back if I were taking someone else with me that I knew would enjoy that type of food.  My goto would be the shrimp for sure.  As for it becoming a regular stop, probably not.  It was far from a 5 star dining experience, and it's a little to artery clogging for my taste."}
{"text":"My first time visiting this restaurant was on Sunday. The buffet was good. The staff was great. Plan to visit again when I return to Charlotte."}
{"text":"I felt like a barbarian in there, scarfing down my food with my hands not even pausing to look up or take a sip of water. I know they were thinking, \"Poor little Asian girl. She must not have eaten in days. Bless her heart.\" Ordered the fried chicken with green beans and collards. The chicken was dynamite ... the collards were juicy with a kick. Green beans had no flavor ... should have ordered okra. Will definitely be back for the fried tilapia. I thought the portions and wait were fine .... no food coma here. 

This is a casual joint, but I came Sunday early afternoon so the place was packed with folks in their Sunday best. I was the most underdressed for sure."}
{"text":"If you are looking for home cooking, this is the place to be. Very southern soul and great hospitality as soon as you walk in. Wish I'd tried to buffet but overall great, especially the collard greens."}
{"text":"La'wan's was my introduction to real southern soul food. It was great and is still great. They offer seven different daily specials that come with two side and a drink. In addition to the daily specials, there are weekly specials by the day of the week, that are also accompanied by two sides and a drink. 

Mac n' cheese like I've never had on the west coast. (hence my intro to soul food) It isn't just a straight creamy mac, but it still has chunks of cheese and is quite stiff, greasy and oh so tasty. They also offer other traditional southernsides; collard greens, black eyed peas, applesauce (for pork chops), green beans, etc. Gizzards and Fried livers too. 

Fried chicken here isn't traditional. They use like an herb \"shake n bake\" esque type batter, then fried. Quite tasty nonetheless. 

For those of you who haven't been here, I guess I'll let the secret out. 
This establishment has won many \"hoodie awards\" given out by the Steve Harvey morning show. It is very eclectic with a wide range of customers  ranging from suits and ties to everyday laborers. 

La'wans is one of my bi-weekly lunch options and I highly recommend it to anyone who appreciates good home style cooking.

--WARNING-- Do not get the smothered pork chops for lunch. You will be comatose! You have been warned. ;)"}
{"text":"Great service, for a called in pickup order. Unfortunately, the food was just so-so. We had fried chicken (white & dark), mac & cheese, mash potatoes, green beans and potato salad. The white meat was completely dried out and the crust was just ok. The mac & cheese was just noodles wis some cheese on top. 

I wouldn't rule out la'wan's, but I did have higher expectations"}
{"text":"Great food. I don't usually eat yams or sweet potatoes but I devoured theirs! Delish."}
{"text":"Now THIS is the best soul food restaurant i've tasted so far. When I go, its during lunch. I've gone with coworkers or sometimes I go by myself. One of my coworkers, a white girl, was a bit nervous about going at first. I guess she thought I was taking her to the hood. But I told her that there's a mix of people who go here. When we arrived she was completely comfortable and thoroughly enjoyed the meal. I typically get the buffet. It pretty much always has Fried Fish, Fried Chicken, Mac&Cheese & Collard Greens on it which is ALL I NEED!! Sooooo delicious!!! When i'm not at the buffet i'll get the fried Pork Chops. OMG! Just like your momma made them!! Everything is actually. The cornbread is just OK tho. I can normally pass on the cornbread/roll. The servers are always really nice and i've never had a super long wait here. You definitely can't go wrong here!"}
{"text":"Even though I work around the corner and have often asked coworkers about La'Wan's, this was my first visit and it proved wrong everything a coworker said about the place.

She said portions were small and I didn't see that at all here.  My fried shrimp came with at least 10 shrimp. The collards were plentiful as well as the mac n cheese.  

The shrimp were a decent size and the coating had a bit of spice to it.  The collards were wonderful but i disagree with Rod O.  I thought the mac n cheese was just average here.  

What really shined here was the service.  Everyone, and I do mean Everyone was friendly and happy to answer any questions or requests.  They made sure you left with a smile."}
{"text":"A co-worker and I visited last week on the recommendation of someone raving about the pork chops. I'm a neat nik and germaphobia, so I was a bit put off by the nasty seats in a food establishment. Clean your seats, for goodness sakes! The food was so so, the chicken was a disappointment. I did like the mac and cheese, however. When we went to pay, the on-duty manager was a bit uppity, but our server was wonderful, lots of smiles! I loved, loved the place when they were across the street, but this side of the street, not so much! I believe that I'll stick with K&W in Pineville. Good food and warm hospitality!"}
{"text":"Food was ok, I ordered whiting fish with cabbage and Mac and cheese. Everyone was really nice, but my food took a little longer than informed. Also, I received one small piece of fish so I was a little confused by the wait. Nonetheless, my fish was extra crispy and the Mac and cheese were good. The cabbage wasn't my favorite, as it was too bland for my liking. 

I don't believe in counting mom n' pop places out, so I may try here again... just something different next time."}
