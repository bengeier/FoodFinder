{"text":"Salty burger, bland guacamole, soggy flavorless fries, fried green tomatoes floating in grease.  Needless to say $42 dollar for two with only one beer is crazy.  Save your time and money and head to B-Spot, FlipSide or Beer Engine."}
{"text":"Honestly I'm not a huge burger fan but I have went 3 times and I'm totally feeling this place their burgers a so good I can't even pick a favorite.  My kids who are adults just love it ..I love their homemade chips if your ever in the mood for a great burger The Rail is the place ..great food great service clean place ."}
{"text":"I was there on 5/9/14...our waitress was awesome but the food was ok, nothing special which sucks after hearing such great reviews... after an hour I was horribly sick all night and the whole next day from food poisoning!!  I will never go back!"}
{"text":"Unbelievably well cooked, juicy burger. Great service as well, but WOW was that fantastic. Everything from the sauce to the fries was angelic and I can not find a way for them to improve. By far the best burger I have found in the Cleveland area."}
{"text":"Had an excellent dinner. Burger was made perfectly, fries to get is truffle oil fries. And don't forget to get their house mayo- really good. Top it off with a shake and you have yourself a great burger dinner."}
{"text":"MIchael Symon is clearly not spending enough time at his own restaurants, because The Rail excels where B Spot struggles to execute on the simplest of menu items.  I have had two great experiences in a row at the Rail. Between good drink specials, surprising and tasty salads, and a uniquely crafted burger, the Rail actually has it all and does everything well. Get the Caprese Salad instead of fries to justify the meaty burger you are about to devour.   The bar is a cool space with damn good drink specials. You forget that you are attached to a mall. I don't know if you could find $3 long islands anywhere else. And in my unprofessional, uncertain opinion they don't actually use a cheap catch-all mixer to emulate the real thing.   Current special is a Lamb Burger. Definitely worth it."}
{"text":"Good burger. Good place. Beer selection was awesome, all the sides were terrific, and the service was what it should be.  My only complaint and they're my complaints, I'm not a big fan of \"bells and whistles\" burgers.  My wife and I split the special, lamb burger and the crouching burger. The lamb was OK. I love lamb. It's better than an $18 one I've had, but not better than a $5 one love. The crouching burger was very good, pork on top a little dry but great sauce and fantastic bacon.  Kids demolished the corn dogs, mac and cheese bites(really tasty,) and the pork crackling. Fries and house chips were good as well.   Just for me it's hard to drop $75, family of four, everyone got a side, and 3 beers between the wife and I. When I, and family, can go down the street and get a no frills good burger in the $25-30 range.  Still a good place to check out. I did like it, just didn't love it."}
{"text":"This place was phenomenal. I took my boyfriend here for his birthday, and we loved the food. The chips were simply the best! The hostess seemed very distracted by whoever was in the kitchen, and didnt notice us when we walked in, so someone had to get her for us after we stood there for a few minutes, but that was the only minor annoyance. We were seated quickly at a clean table, and our orders were taken nearly right away. The drinks seemed to take a while to get to us, but after we got those the appetizer we ordered came out pretty fast. The burgers took a while to prepare also, but we had an appetizer and drinks to make time go by faster. We went here on a whim because my boyfriend couldn't make up his mind, and we were so very happy we did. He kept pointing out what he liked about the place, how much he enjoyed his drink, the freshness of the chips, and how they were \"how all chips should be everywhere\"  When we left we were absolutely stuffed. It was kinda expensive for a burger night. Including an appetizer, drinks, main dishes, and the side of chips + tip i spent 70 bucks, but it was worth it to make my guy feel great for his b-day.  I mean my god, he still talks about how good his burger was, and i find myself craving the chicken sandwich i had on a regular basis! We will be coming back. One star was removed because of the lack of attention from the hostess."}
{"text":"Get the \"7th heaven\" and expect a fork and knife!  I've been back several times for it!  I prefer it as it comes, no need to add cheese.  Love to start with fried pickles.  Love this place!"}
{"text":"Honestly, I wanted the experience to be better. Restaurant wasn't crowded, but still picked up a cloth and paper napkin from under my bar stool before I sat down....Ordered a grilled cesar salad, and a burger. The salad was limp and chicken was soggy. I think the grill hadn't been cleaned in a very long time, because the charring made it taste dirty......Pushed most of the chicken to the side. The burger was okay, very dry,  but wasn't anything like the bartender explained, and was small in size for the price. Fries were brought out when we asked for coleslaw. Bartender was nice enough though, brought out coleslaw for us, and was very upbeat, so that was a plus. In all, not what I wanted for a 40-something bill."}
{"text":"In town for business staying across the street while shopping at the mall someone mentioned the rail as a good place for a burger so that's a good start.   Pretty simple menu food one side beer and drinks on the other. Nice size bar in the front with some booths as well downstairs. Family seating upstairs.   Monthly special burgers this month is the heart burn. Probably would have tried it in my younger years but I went with one of their standard burgers with my typical picky remove stuff ad different stuff.   Got the fried pickles as an app with a bottled yuengling. They have about 25 beers on draft with some local Brews.   Friendly service, food came out quick and hot and most importantly right!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Great place with great food. I had a burger called the mr. Mozlia and the waitress recommended to get it with chicken instead of beef. Man it was to die for! My wife had the burger with the fried egg and now she is speechless! Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"The rail is my all-time favorite sit-down go to burger joint in Ohio. It is located as an attached restaurant to the North Olmsted mall. The service is excellent and it is a fun place to watch a game. I don't enjoy shopping but there's that too.  Everything is organic, farm-raised and grown in Ohio. I always start off with the mac and cheese bites which is always a table favorite. My burger of choice is the bootlegger which comes with onion straws and some kind of funky BBQ sauce but then I made the addition of grilled mushrooms and a fried egg on top with a side of as many truffle fries \"as God will allow.\"  They have a lot of healthy options like substituting your bun for a salad wedge, or getting the vegetarian burger which might be the only veggie burger that ever made me go \"mmmmmm!\"   Last but not least, they have a very extensive Ohio (Because Ohio is better than Michigan... heh heh heh) craft beer selection which has a seasonal brews section. Plenty of wine too.  The food is a bit pricey but I don't mind paying a bit extra for the quality, you get what you pay for. Try it out and you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Had to try the burgers in this place. I tried the Tourist Burger. It was outstanding. Nice and juicy and the right amount of toppings. All tasty. The person I was with liked their burger too. We both had martini's which were yummy too. The service was good and even though there was a wait we only had to sit at the bar long enough to order our drinks and then got seated. It was a great experience overall."}
{"text":"Best burger by far in Cleveland! Better than B spot, brown bag, and five guys. The ingredients are super fresh and it is completely obvious by the taste of these burgers. Every month there is a special burger and all of them are worth a try. The Local Yokel and BBQ burger are awesome!   Not to mention the servers and management are very friendly and helpful. We love going here."}
{"text":"Lunch today grand total for 3 people $55.62 before tip.  We ordered 2 burgers and one of the Monthly Special Turkey Burger, 1 Dortmunder , 1 Iced Tea and our son had the $6.00 Nutella Shake which he thought was good. 1 small but good order of loaded fries also $6.00 that had been served as an appetizer. Our server Amanda was 2X called to pick up our sandwiches that we could see from our table sitting under the warming lights. Music was good, ladies bathroom was clean our table wobbled. Much better than 5 Guys, cheaper than B Spot and about as good as Brown Bag Burgers."}
{"text":"I live nearby and was looking for a good burger joint. Pretty pricey and burgers and fries were ok ... service could have been a bit better as well."}
{"text":"I noticed the Rail while walking into the mall and decided to eat here later that night. The veggie burgers was tasty, the beers were good (all Ohio!), and the service wasn't bad. The food is not cheap but it's completely justified by the fact that everything is sourced from the great state of Ohio. The Rail is part of the new development at the mall and is worth a try before a movie or after doing some shopping."}
{"text":"Burgers were descent, the veggie burger could use some work (yes I know it's a burger place). Selection of beers not shabby."}
{"text":"Delicious Burger! The best! Good Beer. Waiting to be seated was a little awkward due to limited space. Milkshakes were delicious!"}
{"text":"I had lunch here after I came into town to have lunch with a local attorney.  The service was good, but the location was a little odd.    I would certainly recommend this place for someone interested in local (to Ohio) type foods - the food is all produced from Ohio products.  While I would never tell my friends in Ann Arbor that Ohio makes a good burger, it is true!"}
{"text":"This was truly one of the best places I have been lately for a burger.  The wait was 25 minutes but it flew by as the bartenders entertained our two year old with a Shirley temple.  The service was a bit slow at the time we sat down but that was the only kink in the road.  We enjoyed our burgers immensely - my husband had the bootlegger and I had the 7th heaven.  My burger was one of the best I have had and we go to a lot of new places that tote being the best Cleveland burger around (Sorry Michael Symon).  Our son had the kids grilled cheese and vanilla milkshake that was great - so great that my husband and I kept stealing it from him.  The beer flight was a nice touch as was the pretzel bites.  The only ho-hum was the plain old skinny fries.  Not bad, just nothing to write home about.   If you are looking for a place for a fantastic burger, we would recommend and we will be back!  Price was what we expected and service pretty good."}
{"text":"Ordered take out again from the rail. The Mr. Mariola burger was outstanding. Got a side order of the skinny fries and suggest not to order those. Waste of money."}
{"text":"I was a little disappointed. Burger was cooked poorly. Undercooked and hand packed to tightly, not allowing the burger to cook properly. The was no crust on surface of burger and could of had a little mire seasoning. I rate the overall experience as good to average but not exceptional. Leaving the place, my stomach didnt feel satisified, but slightly upset. The server was very good. We may give it another chance in a little while."}
{"text":"Read some reviews. Decided to give it a try. First time. It is a nice space - open atmosphere and nicely lit. We sat at the bar and were handled very nicely by the staff. I had a Fathead draft and my wife tried a white sangria. excellent. Started with the pickle slices. Very good. Salty but with a nice crunch. We both ordered salads. The caprese salad was very good, The balsamic was paired very nicely with the rich cheese and hearty tomato slices. I ordered the Rail with cheese (let,tom,oni) med rare. My wife had the turkey burger with cheese. They were both A+++! I have never had a better hamburger and she agreed that her turkey was amazing as well. The burger was prepared perfectly. It was juicy and soft and very very fresh tasting. We will both be back again and again.  I would have given it 5 stars - but we ordered a cherry pie dessert to go (we were too full and satisfied to even attempt to eat it on site). When we had the pie later that night, it was flat tasting and a let down. BUT--- we didn't go there for the pie -- we went for burgers and those WERE AMAZING!"}
{"text":"Blah! That's what I have to say about The Rail. I was bummed at the wait, I was bummed at the slow service and I was bummed at the à la carte fries, of which I received a stingey portion. I mean, if I'm paying big bucks for a burger can you throw in the fries? Potatoes really are not a bank breaker, right?  The atmosphere is all blond wood, glass and steel. The restaurant is set up in a narrow space so, yeah, I got the feeling of being in the cattle queue , waiting at the rail yard to be packed onto a cattle car and sent on my way to the slaughter house. too much? Maybe so, but I was just not thrilled with my overall experience.   Food was ok but the hype far exceeds the flavor. Perhaps if I was not a good cook that looks to be wowed by food cooked for me then I would have a different feeling. Meh!"}
{"text":"When this place first opened it was amazing. Then the turnover in kitchen staff meant the food needed more work. Change in management led to a different experience. If you order a burger medium well, you don't expect a cold raw center. Nor do I care to listen to 50 year old stale Beatles and Rolling Stones tunes while eating. Waiter could have left us alone to eat our meals a little more, but over all it was good. The well done burgers were much better than medium well, which were so cold there was no taste. There's no getting around a large tab when you have hungry teens. It was $77 before tip. But really that was 3 burgers, 1 coke, 3 fries, 1 beer and 1 onion ring. Expect to shell out some money, go on an off time, order your burger well done and you will get great food."}
{"text":"I must admit, I'm not a huge hamburger fan but The Rail has made me appreciate what a truly good burger means.  They never disappoint, the burgers are tasty, seasoned well, and just the right size.  Follow it with a marshmallow milkshake and you have died and gone to heaven"}
{"text":"I've been in here a few times for dinner and generally like the place. Today I was in for lunch and found that when you skip the beer it's pretty underwhelming.  I had the 7th Heaven Burger ($11.50) with bacon and truffle butter. Ordered medium but got well done. The meat was decent but besides being extremely slippery you couldn't taste any truffle. The bacon looked like what you get at a hotel free buffet breakfast. Add to this a side of truffle fries ($6.75) that were also slippery without a hint of truffle. One star for presentation.  The waitress was friendly. I'll come back for the beer."}
{"text":"Worst service ever. I understand why this place always has an hour wait.... Service is so slow. Took 15 minutes to get a server to take my drink order. Another 20 mins to order food. I was charged for a bunch of extra condiments that I didn't even order. Food was mediocre at best."}
{"text":"A friend if mine works here so I thought I'd give it a whirl. All of their beer is ohio brewed which is pretty cool. I had the fried mushrooms to start, which had some spice to the breading! For dinner I ordered the bruschetta burger with truffle fries. Cooked perfect! The only reason I gave it four stars was because the burgers don't come with a side, which makes ordering fries separate a little pricey. Worth checking out, cool atmosphere!"}
{"text":"We come to the Rail often and really like it.  The food and service can be inconsistent sometimes but that's most places and the good outweighs the bad and doesn't keep us from coming back. We seem to have better service when we sit at the bar. But we really like the burgers here and I love the pulled pork sandwich. I always want to get a shake but never have room and that's even without fries. I have had a milkshake once and it's really good and when I've gotten the fries they are good as well."}
{"text":"Love that they use local stuff only! Freshest burger I've ever had. The fried pickles were perfectly seasoned unlike other places. The server seemed frazzled but the food outweighed the service. Will return soon"}
{"text":"Awesome place great food!! Fun atmosphere, amazing and friendly service, great burgers and awesome drink choices!! Really good and worth it!! Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Was excited to eat here, and the food wasn't  bad. But the service was abysmal.   To start with they try to do that overly precious seating concept where they hand out name tags for you to wear while you wait for a table. The name tags are all Ohio counties, playing off their \"local food\" gimmick.   Well the staff apparently gave out the same name tag a few times, because when they called our county name, two other couples came up to try to get the same table. Awkward.   The whole vibe was very clichéd. They have that whole lightbulb pendant chandelier thing going on. Yawn.   Our waitress was unpleasant and gave the impression she couldn't believe she was working on a Saturday night.   The cherry on top (or lack thereof) was dessert. I ordered the brownie sundae and I was served a milkshake instead. I didn't bother to complain because I didn't feel like encountering the wrath of The Sourpuss as we nicknamed the waitress.   Instead I left the shake untouched on the table, and a nasty review on Yelp. That's how passive aggressive people make a statement. Take that Sourpuss."}
{"text":"Wow. Avoid the server who just likes to lean all over your personal space while you order, doesn't give you ANY silverware unless you bother another server, throws your food down on the table and slides it to you, walks away and is not to be seen for a while...oh, and asks you how every thing as he walks by and doesn't bother to stop. Still does it. Asshole. I can't take this place anymore, his service is absolutely abysmal and its shocking he STILL does it. Oh, short guy with red hair and glasses. Would love to know his name to name drop but he just doesn't bother to give it or care for much of anything. Sadly, The Rail offered so much potential when it first opened, now I feel no one gives a shit anymore....so neither do I. No longer making an appearance at this location, even if it was free."}
{"text":"The place looks pretty cool. Nice looking bar and overall a chic and trendy atmosphere. The staff is very friendly and will take their time to explain the restaurant concept (local grass fed cattle etc.).   The burgers are decent. They taste about the same as any burger. However the food is way overpriced. In other words, the food both quality and quantity wise did not justify the price. Unless this place comes up with a day when they discount the burgers I will save my hard earned cash."}
{"text":"Yum. It was freaking awesome.  I had lunch with my boyfriend .  Sorry I didn't take pictures of our food. We were really hungry and the food was great."}
{"text":"A group of close to 50 came in tonight. We had called earlier in the day to make sure that we could be accommodated. The restaurant had no problem.  We were seated in our own little area and had two amazing servers, Breanna and Erika. These two worked hard but they were fabulous. The burgers everyone said were amazing as well.   thank you and an A++ to the restaurant and the staff."}
{"text":"Today was my second visit to The Rail and was just as good a the first time.  The ingredients are fresh and delicious and the menu has lots of interesting combinations.  Even better it is kid friendly and opens at 11 which was perfect for my daughter for lunch.  Our server was very friendly and made some great recommendations.   I loved the music selection that was playing (primarily classic rock - Steve Miller, John Lennon, Stones, etc). My only disappointment is the fact that since I'm pregnant I haven't been able to try their great beer selection yet!!!"}
{"text":"Had lunch there about 2 weeks ago.  First off, the staffs are very friendly and the place seem pretty clean, service was ok.  As for the food, I've had much better burgers for cheaper price.  I ordered a Med well burger and got a well done burger.  Outside was pretty much charred black.  Their burgers are WAY over priced especially when all the sides are EXTRA.  I've never been to a sit down place (not fast food joints) where all other items are a la carte.  The price for their burgers is basically for the meat and bun ONLY.  We had lunch for four and it came out to about $70 with no alcohol."}
{"text":"I'll tell you what. Get the Lamb Burger and you won't be let down. The General Manager is very down to Earth and friendly as well so is the wait staff"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. The atmosphere is nice and for a Saturday evening the wait time was very reasonable at only 10 minutes. I tried the mac and cheese bites- delicious. The problem came when my burger arrived. I asked for a well done burger. I even told my server if the burger was a little burnt, I would be ok with that. My burger arrives and it's medium, at best. When I gave it back to him, he seemed confused my request, like it wasn't pink on the inside. It only took a few minutes for my new burger to arrive, but I ordered cheddar cheese and was given american. I guess I should just be thankful that it was well done this time around. I mentioned it to the server just as an FYI because I was so hungry that I needed to eat. I also didn't want to send back my food for a second time. The server didn't really seem apologetic about it. The gentleman who delivered my second burger was a manger, I think, because he was wearing a long- sleeved, button down rather than a T-shirt. I would have expected a manger to apologize about the inconvenience of my order being wrong, but he didn't. The burger was good, not the best I've ever had, but better than B-Spot in my opinion. I also tried the onion rings; good, but not great. I agree with most of the other reviews that the pricing may be just a tad high. Overall given the less than mediocre service and just \"ok\" burgers, I don't think I'll be going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"The Rail is fucking AWESOME. First time there this evening - let me tell you, it feels like this place doesn't belong on some corner of a mall, but maybe that's what makes it even better - it's like a delicious juicy secret that only the stealthy burger club people know about.   The service for one, is STELLAR. My fiancé and I got in the door and were anticipating a 10 minute or so wait, based on what the hostess told us. We were sitting for maybe two minutes, and she offered up a huge six person booth just for us. We were like HELL YEAH! We scooted in to our ginormous private booth and were met shortly after by our server, who was not only SUPER friendly and nice, but also knowledgable about the beer and the burgers. HUGE plus. I know not everyone out there likes beer, or bloody red meat for that matter, but I really appreciate it when my server is on my level, it enables me to trust them, because I know they're good people. It's that burger/beer unspoken bond. You just get it.   The atmosphere is warm and inviting, nothing is too loud, it just feels good. The booths are very comfortable, the decor is nice to look at, the tables are sturdy wood, everything flows very nicely together. I was just very happy to be in the space I was in. The wagon wheel lighting is also awesome and visually pleasing.  The burgers are unreal. Cooked to perfection, and ALL LOCAL FARM FRESH OHIO BEEF. So delicious, I had the blue Bessie -  1/2-lb of Ohio beef on a layer of Horseradish sauce and spinach, then topped with blue cheese crumbles, sauteed 'shrooms and tobacco onions. And I ate the whole thing. My fiancé had the December special, the lamb burger - equal blend of lamb and beef, fresh mozzarella, house made cucumber dill sauce, sautéed bell peppers and red onion, lettuce, tomato - he added a fried egg on top, per our server's suggestion - he polished it off before I was half done with mine. Oh, did I mention we got the something or other fries for an appetizer? fries, pulled pork, rail sauce, bacon, cheese and green onions - amazing.  I have ZERO bad things to say about The Rail. If you worship the burger like I do, this is your heaven. Go to there and see. Be enlightened. You will not be disappointed. Promise."}
{"text":"Disclaimer - I did not have their burger.   The ambience and decor is nice.  I like how they have the upstairs sitting.  The server was ok. It was pretty dead when we got there...... So everything was quick. I had the pita wrap...  Nothing special in taste.  It was just folded up in half. Makes for very messing eating. They could have wrapped it up better.  All the onions were put in one place. I'd go again and try their burger and see if I need to up the stars from 3."}
{"text":"My husband and I were extremely disappointed with this restaurant. We came in and asked for a couple minutes, which led to over 15. Then, our server took our order without writing anything down. Of course, he messed up my order but it took another 10 minutes to get him back to the table to fix it AND then another 10 minutes for our condiments. So, by the time we ate our food it was cold. The burgers were sub-par ... very greasy!!!  Also, the value was awful. We paid almost 5 dollars for MAYBE 5 onion rings!!What they do is take one onion ring and stand it up in a cup, then they put a stick through it and stack other onion rings on it, to make it look like there is more.   My husband and I were extremely disappointed with this restaurant. This restaurant is all about ADD-ON's and our server prioritized his customers based on their bill. So, because we were not ordering several drinks and adding a guacamole spread to our burgers, we were completely ignored. It's not like our server was swamped because he was around just not for us. We had to ask for refills a couple times before even receiving them.   Unfortunately, I would not recommend this place to anyone. If you are looking for farm raised beef that tastes delicious, great value, and AMAZING service... Go to Heck's Café in Ohio City!!"}
{"text":"Went to The Rail with the family and was pleasantly surprised. Everybody and their mother has opened a burger joint- I don't get it; burgers have been around for ever and now they're all the rage? Anyways, we had great service.  My wife and I had The Local Yokel. Good but very messy and hard to eat. The bun was mushy, but the meat was well-seasoned and tasty. The kids loved the milkshakes and the Mac-n- Cheese Bites were a hit.  We'll be back."}
{"text":"Better than B Spot.  Their burgers are great.  I've liked every one I've tried.  They had buffalo burgers on the menu as a special and they did a great job of keeping the meat juicy.  The truffle fries are to die for.  You must try them!!  They have a great beer menu and do flights in case you don't know which beer you want to try.  The service has always been good here.  The manager even came by to make sure everything was good and to remove empty plates from the table."}
{"text":"Lunch here a few weeks back, first time giving it a try.  Enjoyed the burgers and fries...meat is \"mostly\" grass fed (their term, not mine) and topping combinations were varied and well put together.  Cooking temps were right on point.  A bit on the expensive side, but still in-line with most current gourmet burger joints.  Would eat here again for sure."}
{"text":"I'm giving The Rail three stars instead of four solely due to the fact that we were seated by the hostess AFTER other guests that had come in after us!  Otherwise the food was great. I ordered the electric lemonade as suggested by the bartender and it was tasty. Couldn't really do more than one or two if I tried though on account of it being a bit sweet for my liking.  For my burger I also went with the bartender's suggestion and ordered their \"Crouching Burger (Hidden Bacon)\" burger (Ohio thick-cut bacon | pork shoulder | crispy won-ton | rail sauce). It was delicious and cooked how I ordered it. It was not disappointing for $10.50. I believe we had the Gouda Cheese Bites as well which were intensely appetizing.  I would suggest coming here for a meal prior to catching a film at the new Great Northern movie theater!  Food: 4/5 Service: 2.5/5 Atmosphere: 4/5"}
{"text":"Walked in and didnt even get greeted. After a 5 minuet wait someone finalky said hello. At that point I knew that the service was going to be shitty. We sat down and ordered and they put a lamb burger on one of the other burgers. Messed up the entire order when all i wanted was just a lamb burger with truffle fries... we got an aplogy but didnt offer to take the wrong item off the bill or pay for some of the drinks. I dont expect to get free stuff, but its the least you can do for poor service... or maybe an aplogy. Don't waste your time."}
{"text":"Not sure if I'm feeling 3 or 4 stars for this. I feel like I need to go again to say for sure (anyone want to go?).   The location is easy to get to as it's near 480 and at the Great Northern mall. It's a nicely put together space.   I like the concept in general. Local/in-state raised beef, Ohio beers, etc. The Rail does it well without being too annoying about it.  I sat at the bar and had good service. I had the white peach sangria (Monday night drink special). It was decent. I should have followed my heart and had a milkshake instead. Ahh, hello regret, my good friend. I ordered the bootlegger burger medium well. (Aged cheddar, bourbon bbq sauce, tobacco onions)  I thought it was cooked properly/well. It tasted great. Flavorful beef. Juicy but grease wasn't dripping down my hands (looking at you B Spot!). The toppings were generous and offered the right amount of flavor but didn't overwhelm the burger. It's my personal preference not to have a burger swimming in BBQ or another sauce. If the burger sucks, then by all means cover that thing in whatever you've got. But a good burger shouldn't need/rely on that. It's in my top five burgers in CLE. Need to go again to really get an idea as to what they've got going on.  I ordered truffle fries to accompany it and they were lackluster to say the least. If there was any truffle oil (or whatever) involved, I couldn't tell. The fries were large in quantity but unremarkable.   As someone else mentioned, burgers aren't accompanied by anything (other than a pickle spear, apparently) so fries and other sides are an extra cost. For a really good burger, I don't mind.   Looking forward to returning."}
{"text":"Cool spot with great Ohio beer assortment on tap. Good mac & cheese bite app. New lady bartender was delightful and knew her beer. Me and colleague were there Monday night when a certain Ohio based college football squad was battling for a certain national title.  I asked if the TV sound could replace music, bartender ran upstairs and back down to deliver a \"sorry....manager said no\". Asked for manager, whereupon Dan came down to tell me it's \"company policy\" and perhaps the TV sound might not sit well with say the mythical family seated at a booth. When I reminded Dan of the epic game and the fact that we, his bar/restaurant, and many other people (some of which were clad in scarlet and gray) were all actually in Ohio....he still refused.  Either he doesn't have control of the remote (in which case I'd resort to adding flair), or he just didn't want to accommodate us and others for the single biggest game in decades. And we're not even from Ohio!!  Oh well, we went to Fatheads and enjoyed the game, with sound, beer, and good food. Either be a real bar/restaurant or be stuck to a mall."}
{"text":"Went for Mother's Day with my children. Had the local yokel AMAZING!! Best Bacon I have had EVER!! Mocha Milkshake was good. Humus appetizer very good! Would have given 5 stars but the onion rings were eh...Would go back but would get the sweet potato fries or skip the fries and try a salad!! Service is good, nice place!"}
{"text":"The trouble began with trying to find the place. It was after dark, and they are attached to the mall between JC Penny and the cinema. I didn't know this at the time. They have TWO neon signs, but didn't bother to turn them on. Once there, I told the host, but he said maybe the sign is burned out. I said, you have two, so I doubt they are both burned out. Probably just not turned on. When we left, signs were still dark. Maybe the staff didn't want much business that night.   The waitress and service once seated was great. Place was clean. Nice environment.  The food. Well, first, it is a little ridiculous to have half pound burgers and no smaller size. What does Grandma or a child eat? Yes they have a child slider for nearly the price of a full half pounder, which makes no sense. 1/4 or 1/3 pound patties should be an option. In my party of 7, 6 of us shared burgers, which came out pre cut on separate plates for I believe no extra charge, which was nice. Meat was actually cooked to order: medium well did NOT come out well done as it does most places, so that is a plus. However, meat needed seasoning, and perhaps a better flavor of meat and fat ratio. In other words, nothing special at best. Good cheese choices for a cheese burger though.  Fries (regular and sweet potatoe, both shoe string) were a mix of crispy and just mushy. Pretzel bites, fried, lacked something. They were just ok. Fried pickles were the same.  Overall, okay. I could eat here again. But I think I will go to Brown Bag Burger nearly next door instead next time, which has been rated higher.  Had a decent beer collection and $3 happy hour margaritas though.  I'd give it a 2.5, but as I must round, don't believe they deserve a 3.0, so 2.0 it is."}
{"text":"This place really isn't that great, at all. They're WAY overpriced for their mediocre service and food. You would think with how expensive the burgers are you'd at least get fries on the side but no that's an extra amount of dollars to spend. They also got rid of the fried olives which is the only thing that brought me back. Not to mention I got super sick after my last visit. Not coming back.. ever."}
{"text":"Okay, I'm gonna keep things short and sweet here. Tonight was my first experience at the Rail; I came with high expectations, and left with all of them met and then some! My father, girlfriend and I ordered the bourbon bbq burger, the burger with red onion jam, bacon, and truffle butter, (still going)the bleu cheese burger with caramelized onion and spinach, the nutella crunch milkshake, peanut butter brownie milkshake, and truffle fries.   I ordered the bourbon bbq burger with aged cheddar and tobacco onions. The burger was cooked excellently, was extremely juicy, and very flavorful. The ingredients were all obviously very fresh, and the beef was so tender it practically melted in my mouth. I'm a pretty simple guy, so naturally I prefer simple foods done right, and this was one of them.  We all split the burgers so I got to try the other two.  I don't really like bleu cheese, so I'll focus on things I can say without bias.   The Burger was cooked excellently-- nice and juicy with a good crunch on the top from the sear. The bleu cheese on it was somewhat like a creamy sauce. The spinach added a nice, fibrous crunch to it.   The last burger(truffle butter, bacon, etc..) was dangerous! Holy mother of god! It tasted delicious, but I only took one bite and had to set it down to take the rest home.  The truffle fries were truffle fries. I think they're so basic you can't get them wrong. Good fries, truffle oil, and freshly grated parmesan. Though, I have had trufflier fries elsewhere.. they were still tasty. I think next time I come this way I'll go for the sweet potato fries instead.  Lastly, the milkshakes. The nutella crunch was my favorite by far. It had just the right thickness to it, and somehow was creamy, a good amount of nutella, and a great bit of crunch and flavor from the chocolate wafer.  The pb brownie milkshake was also delicious. This one was much thicker in consistency, and had nice bits of brownie, and a little crunch from chunks of peanutbutter that froze in the making process. I'm actually surprised that I liked the nutella one more, cause I typically go for vanilla or peanutbutter shakes at the local Mitchell's. Oh.. We shared the shakes too.. That's important   Now! Believe it or not, I left without that food-coma feeling despite how much I ate. All of us felt fine. I generally eat very healthily: little to no sugar, almost never eat beef, only lean meats and veggies, etc.., and i still feel great almost an hour later.  Usually I feel dizzy and sick after eating a meal like this, but not this time! That definitely has to be a strong indicator of the quality of the ingredients.  So, to sum things up, the food portions were very generous. A burger and half of a shake was enough to fill me up beyond full. The fries may have been over-kill. The service was excellent, but sadly the name of our waitress slipped my mind, and I don't have my receipt. Three gourmet burgers, fries, two milkshakes, and plenty of leftovers to spare; $57 was the price for three people getting a good idea of what this place had to offer, and it was well worth it! I'd definitely recommend checking it out!"}
{"text":"So I'm here right now with family, husband and baby. Our server is Danny and its his second day here. He is great, great hospitality, great manners, very considerate we appreciated his service to us. We had an issue with the burgers which wasn't the fault of the chef or the waiter we just ordered wrong. If that makes sense. Anyway long story short, Danny took our burgers back and we were shockingly rewarded with thoroughly cooked burgers thanks to him and the chef. This place is awesome. Thank you Danny and thank you also chef Jordan and Juan, we were honestly just going to take them back home and reheat them. They were delicious when we first got them but even better once cooked completely. I'm so grateful we got the opportunity to experience such delicious food and awesome hospitality, though that doesn't exist in to many restaurants these days.We ordered the bon fire burger and tourists burger with sweet potato fries and truffle fries everything was great thanks guys look forward to coming again"}
{"text":"Checked out this place on a Sunday night. Half hour wait to seat our table of 4. We finally got sat in the loft area and waited about 10 minutes for the waiter to take our drink order.  Hubby ordered a side salad that was delivered with his meal and they were out of the burger (crouching something) that I ordered. I ended up ordering a regular burger cooked well that came out very pink. They corrected that pretty quickly. All in all I prefer B Spot for burgers but may give the place another try in the future after the kitchen bugs are worked out."}
{"text":"Pretty good burger overall, but it does not reach Melt good. Also the portion was kind of small for the price. I did get the Crouching burger hidden bacon one which was delicious. Their rail sauce is phenomenal."}
{"text":"Outstanding gourmet burgers coupled with a wide selection of Ohio craft beers. The burgers are really outstanding (I like the build your own), and the fries are always fresh. The decor is not that of a Five Guys or Red Robin - much more sophisticated. I've eaten here three times and have been pleased each time."}
{"text":"This place gets one star solely based on the fact that I can't give it zero.   I liked this place when I first started coming here, but I now plan on avoiding it like the plague.   The the quality of the food when comparing my first visit with my last visit are polar opposites, and that isn't a compliment. The food went from perfectly cooked burgers and crisp fries to greasy and severely overcooked burgers and soggy, limpy fries. There was a literal grease pool from the bun alone.   When you pair bad food with horrible management that does nothing but pick chips out of the serving window instead of asking how everything is, it's no surprise things are the way they are.   This place had so much potential when it first started, and that potential was wasted."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised and I would definitely go back.  Started with a loaded French fry type appetizer that was very good.  Pulled pork, bbq, cheese and fresh fries came in a huge portion.  Mojo burger was very good.  A little spicy, but not overwhelming.  Was cooked correctly and the bun was fresh.  Was not a huge fan of the 7th Heaven burger.  Was extremely oily bc of the truffle butter, and I found the red onion jam to be way too sweet.  The best thing we ordered was unexpected, and it was the side of pork rinds with the sweet and spicy seasoning.  Arrived warm and very fresh.  Completely different from bagged pork rinds. Service was good, food arrived fast, and overall it was a good experience.  Will be back."}
{"text":"Not cheap, but excellent draft beer selection and the food was perfect. Ya know how ya always get a totally cooked burger when you want it rare .. or med. rare? They nailed it. Been there twice. Enjoyed both trips. Our office manager had to drag me out so we could go back to work ... Dude at the bar is supposed to call me once they get a tee shirt in my size. Which of course is exceedingly muscular ....   ... Joe www.CleMedicare.com"}
{"text":"Love this place the burgers the fries the home grown meat n brew the knowledge of the staff to die for milk shakes"}
{"text":"Awesome burgers. The tater tots and onion rings were delicious. I love this place. Shakes are great too"}
{"text":"Great burgers, sweet potato fries with chipotle mayo amazing. Great local organic atmosphere."}
{"text":"the meat for the burger is quality, the service was very good, I liked that there are lots of windows, good variety of burgers to pick from, the one I got had truffle butter, it was really boaring and one of the most expensive, won't make that mistake again.  I would go back.   Great selection of beer."}
{"text":"If you're a burger lover and appreciate high quality food then The Rail absolutely cannot be beat. My husband is the biggest burger guy I know so he orders them everywhere we go. The Rail is far and away his favorite. I've had great service every single time I've eaten here. My personal favorite is the tourist with the addition of fresh mozzarella. If you're at great northern then there is no better choice. Forget about all the other options because they will fall short."}
{"text":"Bar menu is delightful and there's a patio to enjoy your drinks during the nice weather. If you get hungry they have a large burger menu too"}
{"text":"Tried this place out for the first time last night and I gotta say, I came away with no complaints whatsoever! What a great addition to North Olmsted!   My first impression when I walked in was that this is a beautiful restaurant! I really like all of the decor and the layout. There's a small loft type sitaution upstairs with extra seating. It's just really interesting looking and very well planned out, from the looks of it! Not a huge restaruant so there might end up being sizeable wait times if there's a crowd coming in from the mall or a movie but it wasn't bad last night. Good sized bar area to wait in, too!   The menu isn't huge but it's got good variety. Lots of Ohio beers and other alcoholic beverages to choose from. I also tried the pretzel bites appetizer - delicious! Deep fried pretzel bites with beer cheese dip. I'm on board every time when I see beer cheese! It was very tasty.   As for entrees, they have salads and sandwiches but clearly the main item is the burger. You can get a veggie burger (yay!) or chicken instead on any burger, which is great. They're all a bit pricey - starting at $9 - and do not come with sides. However, it's Ohio, grass fed beef and quality ingredients all over the menu, so I don't mind paying a little bit more for that kind of food. I believe the veggie burger was house made, too! It tasted very good and not like something that had been frozen.   Lots of specialty burger opitions or you can build your own with the availbale toppings. Tobacco onions were very tasty - basically just fried onions but I liked them a lot! The burgers themselves are not huge. My initial reaction was actually disappointment until I realized that every other burger I've been served lately was TOO BIG and I couldn't finish. This is actually a normal sized burger for a normal person! You can eat it in one sitting (unless you fill up on apps and beer...). Remember the quality of the ingredients and you won't mind spending $9+ for this burger. It was really tasty!  The fries and onion rings that we got were also good. I'll definitely be going back to this place and am very happy to see something besides Red Robin in the area for a sit down burger place!"}
{"text":"Went there for lunch.  Had a salad and a burger.  Burger was good but wasn't the best burger I've ever had.  Salad was terrible.  Lettuce was wilted and brown.  Was told the salad was freshly made but obviously either this one was sitting around or made with old ingredients.  Filled out a survey telling them about my first experience there and heard nothing back.  There are so many other good places to go in the area.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, fantastic food! Waitress and other staff were very friendly. Would love to come back again!"}
{"text":"I used to really like this place, but this time, not so much. The burger had an iodine taste that Is still lingering as I am typing this.   Service was good and I still like the look of the place but that taste...."}
{"text":"The Rail is not afraid to cook burgers the way I like them- rare. Great salads and a large selection of local and Ohio brews. I found my new 'go to' burger place."}
{"text":"AWESOME AWESOME burgers, atmosphere, staff and drinks. Everything I have ever had there is a home run! Like them on Instagram and they will post the burger of the weekend. Runs from Friday to Sunday. We are drawn back at least 2 times a month because of this! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"We've been here a few times and they have some of the best burgers, fries and onion rings around. They are closer to home than most places we seem to go! Adjacent to Great Northern Mall. A welcome addition to the North Olmsted food scene! A definite must try!"}
{"text":"Disappointed in the quality. Looked great! Seems like they don't cook fresh food. It was reheated  and dry. Pulled pork was chewy like jerky. Asked for a medium burger, but got over well. At least the service was great. Overpriced  for low quality."}
{"text":"Food was great! I ordered a local yokel burger and replaced the burger with . My friend and I split the pulled pork nachos, also super good. We got our food really fast. The wait was a bit long, but that only means the food is that good and ppl are willing to wait for. The missing one  is because my water cup was dirty. Overall great food and great service. Will definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"Had a good time here, stumbled upon this spot while enjoying some fun furniture shopping , the food was great, get the tots, they are hugenormous!! Great selection of ohio brews."}
{"text":"This place has excellent burgers, great beer selections and wonderful service. They are priced  a little on the high side, but well worth the money spent. Remember to add an egg to your burger for an even yummier treat. The fried pickles are also worth an order to start."}
{"text":"This was my second time at The Rail. The first time, I got a burger, and while it was good, the second time I opted for grilled chicken, and it was AMAZING. I added the delicious jalapeño relish for some spice and it was soooo good.   My favorite part of the meal was the app: fried pickles with jalapeño ranch. I'm a HUGE fan!  The only thing really lacking was the service. It was abnormally slow both times, and I don't like to have to ask for every little thing (refills, silverware, the check, a box, etc) each time I need something. A bit of a pet peeve of mine, but it really is annoying! Would have been 5 stars if not for the meh service."}
{"text":"For a burger place there are plenty of good vegetarian options. My veggie burger was delicious: mushroomy and nicely crisp and super sloppy, and it came on a nicely soft and buttery bun. The fries were good but a bit soggy. The chocolate milkshake was so-so, but made with vanilla ice cream and syrup instead of chocolate ice cream. The biggest disappointment was the iceberg wedge salad: it was small, very skimpy on the dressing and way overpriced at $7.50. The staff was fine; just friendly enough but not exactly warm."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful meal here in the midst of Holiday Hell.   The service was excellent dispite the large crowd of people. Katie was a kind, respectful, and quick and thanked me profusely for being patient while she caters to the table of 6 middle aged women who refused to say thank you for anything (I watched). The professionalism of the service was surprising, as they handled the table next to me of a couple who tactlessly complained about 1. The salad lettuce being \"frozen\" (looked fine to me) 2. The red onion on their burger was bad (looked perfectly fine...) 3. The onion rings were over done (they looked perfectly fine) The funny thing is they replaced everything within seconds and (surprise!) It looked exactly the fricking same. And these people were nodding in satisfaction to the replenished supply of imaginary shit food. Then, the man gets his burger and complains, loudly, that his burger is too well done and after a manager comes over and offers multiple times to replace his burger, cooked properly. He goes \"I'LL JUST GIVE THE REST TO MY DOG.\" Okay, drama queen, I thought to myself. So the manager told him it would be out in literally minutes, and I was surprised at around one minute later it was sitting at his table. I was impressed at the manager for his expedient and courteous dealing with said assholes.   Annnnyway...onto the food. Got a simple burger with cheddar and the typical fixings. Was delicious. Cooked perfectly. All of my vegetables were fresh and normal. Had the homemade pumpkin pie a la mode for dessert. Was delicious. Will be back for the milkshakes and to try a burger that's a little more adventurous."}
{"text":"I love the Rail.  The atmosphere is nice, the food is always fresh, the staff friendly.  I absolutely am addicted to the red pepper mayo!  Also, when they have the chocolate pecan pie....GET IT!!!!!  Their daily drink specials are awesome.  You can't go wrong with a $3 drink.  The Margerita's are made fresh and are very tasty.  The Long Island Ice tea definitely get's the job done!  I thnk the only think I've gotten here that I don't like is the french fries.  Soggy.  But I'm picky about my fries.  LOL!"}
{"text":"Excellent food. I don't feel compelled to review restaurants very often, but this place was phenomenal. I had the crouching burger with skinny fries. The burger wasn't a perfect medium rare, but it was still juicy and flavorful so I didn't mind. I've had a lot of great fries, but these are killing it. They have just the right amount of seasoning and a certain sharp, savory note that I can't seem to figure out. I also had a local blueberry honey ale that was astoundingly good. The service was really laid back and the staff was attentive without being overbearing. Overall, certainly not what I expected for being in a mediocre mall."}
{"text":"Excellent burgers -- absolutely excellent. They definitely are giving the B Spot a run for their money. The quality of beef is superb - Ohio grazed. What would make my review 5 stars is if they offered thick-cut fries (wedges). The current selection of skinny fries are on the soggy side. Good beer selection!"}
{"text":"No good. Server was rude. Food was mediocre. Ordered the lumberjack I believe it's called, breakfast burger, it was sloppily assembled and burnt, the tots were burnt as well. This was my second time here. The first time was ok, and I was hoping it had more potential, so I went back, but I will not be back a third time."}
{"text":"Went to the rail Sunday afternoon for lunch with my wife. We were greeted within a minute of entering and seated right away. The restaurant was clean and comfortable with the music level just right, not too load. Our waitress was prompt getting our drink orders and gave a good service during our stay. The beer selection on tap and bottles was pretty good with a wide selection of local NE Ohio breweries. My burger and my wife's salad we done correctly as we ordered them, nice not to have a over cooked burger.   The price of our meal was fair for the quality. I would rank The Rail on par with B-Spot, Hecks and Flip Side as a upscale burger joint. Location is easy to find and there is plenty of parking at Great Northern mall by the movie theater."}
{"text":"Not sure if I added a review... This place serves outstanding food, excellent service, and amazing local beers on tap. They also have special events to beer taste upstairs which is my favorite thing to do in the Midwest!! Will return soon!!"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of this place, great food.  They specialize in burgers, and they have numerous options so you wont get bored. Great atmosphere and great customer service. We're always taken care of well when we dine here. Strongly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I was so excited to find this place and we really did luck into it. It's at great northern behind Sears and you can only get to it from outside. Definitely a tricky location and not a place you will drive by. Lucky for me, when we Yelped \"burgers\" it came up.   The Rail is a local chain that has a great burger menu and touts local ingredients and local beers. The food was really good, but our burgers suffered from temperature consistency. Mine was perfectly cooked at my requested medium, the husband's was well done even though medium was requested. It happens... My burger, the tourist, was delicious. All the toppings were perfect. The hubs got the BBQ burger and it definitely needs more BBQ. The waitress said that was a common complaint, so I'm sure it will be fixed.   The Rail is a great addition to the westside and especially to the mall area. I like it much better than bspot."}
{"text":"Had a Veggie burger, bootlegger with chicken, and a regular bootlegger. They were all very good. Skinny fries and sweet potato fries were excellent. They use local meat which is very nice. Excellent service provided by Holly."}
{"text":"Best burger I've ever had. I had the tourist with mozzarella and skinny fries. It was amazing! The service was also wonderful! Very friendly and the wait wasn't long at all even though it was a little busy."}
{"text":"Went there for the first time today after hearing rave reviews... Highly disappointed!! The burger was good- juicy and cooked well but way over-priced for what it was- A REGULAR BURGER. For $10 for a burger with just cheese and mushrooms I'd expect something a little more spectacular. Regular topping and bun. I also decided to try the truffle fries and was EXTREMELY disappointed. They tasted like regular old fries to me or actually more like those cripsy potato sticks. Not good and left me feeling a bit sick afterwards. I am one who will spend money on good food and regulary dine at high end places but $18 for a burger and fries is outrageous!! I could have gone to Hyde Park or something along that line and been much happier! Will not go back."}
{"text":"Overpriced, but decent burger. $16 for the basic cheeseburger, fries and coke (before tip). I would say its a good bar burger, nothing to right home about.  If it was $8 i might have said 4 stars but thats pushing it."}
{"text":"Have had the Local Yokel twice.  Burger was pretty good.  Fries are pretty good.  Side salad was below average.  Service was pretty good.  Don't think I'll be coming back though, for the amount I spent I could have the same quality food for alot cheaper elsewhere."}
{"text":"Our first visit to The Rail turned out to be awesome. The meat is fresh, never frozen no preservatives no steroids just all natural beef raised right here in Ohio. All beers are microbrewed here in Ohio as well. Locally grown and raised foods proved to be tasty and delicious! Our server was friendly, knowledgeable of the business and the menu items. Service was fast and food was hot! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Excellent burger. The quality of the meat is second to none. Great flavor, fresh ingredients and food all served quick and hot. Highly recommend the sweet potato fries with any burger. Will definitely come back again as this has become by go-to place for a great classic burger done right."}
{"text":"So back to the Rail after a year. Sadly the demise seems to be following a time honored tradition of small chains.  We tried four beers and found all beers tainted with a dirty tap line flavor. Very off putting. We mentioned this to our waitress who was excellent and working her tail off but the manager and barman both seemed too enamored with a young lady at the bar to (1) help the waitress or (2) do anything about the dirty tap lines.  Let me qualify this review, my wife and I have been to more than 300 breweries in 47 states, seven countries and three continents, we know beer. So let's move to the food. Burgers were average, buns were slightly stale and onion rings were far below average. I'll never go back."}
{"text":"It's amazing. The managers must really keep  a close eye on this place. Food was and place was above what you might expect!"}
{"text":"This review will be short and to the point. I was a little thirsty after watching a movie at the nearby theater. So this placed looked inviting and I was wrong. Walked in and sat down at the bar where there was a total of two other patrons. The female bartender saw me , didn't say anything and stomped her way out to a booth. When she stomped back towards the bar she grabbed a menu and slapped it down in front of me without saying a word. Funny thing is, I had already eaten lunch and just wanted a drink. She would have known this is she had F*CKJNG ASKED ME!!!! Then she then was attempting to make a drink right in front of me and apparently someone had used all the pineapple juice so she slammed that container onto the bar and stomped into the rear of the restaurant. I took this as she wasn't interested in helping me so I left. I will reiterate that I believe Yelp should allow zero star reviews or negative reviews just for examples such as this.  I don't think that giving one star can appropriately rate an establishment."}
{"text":"The service and management excellence sets this restaurant above its peers. Also t doesn't hurt that the food, drinks, and fun atmosphere are all fantastic."}
{"text":"Been dying to try for a while. Finally had the right timing so we went on a Wednesday evening.  It was like speed dining. We ordered chips and they arrived promptly. They were good, if not a little too much blue cheese.  Shortly threafter, our meals arrived. The chicken sandwich was very good.  My burger was well done. It was ordered medium and described as pink all the way through. They must pre char them, because you could not possibly cook a burger well that fast. Received the second one just as quickly. Much better this time. Medium as stated. Extras were mushrooms at room temperature and tobacco onions that were greasy and cold. Held under a light.  Burger was good the second time but was not a good complete plate.  Hate being rushed. We were in no hurry, but they sure seemed to be. Wasn't busy. We were just hoping for more since we heard good things.   Not even time for a second beer or drink."}
{"text":"Great place to grab a bite! I had a Caesar salad and it was served grilled so it had a smokey flavor that I hadn't had before, delicious. Food choices are unique and very appetizing, order a few and share! Relaxed fun atmosphere, people are nice, and drink specials! Friday and Saturday is $3 Long Island hey! And other specials throughout the week.  Give it a try!"}
{"text":"Food was excellent. Service was stellar. Wife and I came in to try it out and the food was incredible. If ever in the area. Check this place out."}
{"text":"Came from out of town and checked it out.  Phenomenal burger.  Patty was juicy and full of flavor.  They also offer adult milkshakes, which is an easy way to my heart.  If you're in Ohio and can check out one of The Rail locations, DO IT!"}
{"text":"Best milkshakes and burgers! * Update - decided to remove my poor word choices due to the owners/operators being so helpful and caring. We're glad that they were able to reach out to us. We love the rail, and will continue to visit. They're good people. :)"}
{"text":"Food smelled good, wish I could say I tried it.  Went in on a Sunday afternoon. Place wasn't super busy, just one other couple sitting at the bar. My fiancé and I sat at the bar and waited, and waited, and waited some more. The bartender walked by us numerous times without saying two words. No, Hi, hello, I'll be right with you- nothing. Didn't even nod at us. We watched him enter his tips into the computer, Make service bar drinks and step off the bar to run food for the kitchen, all while still never acknowledging the fact that we were sitting right in front of him with no menus, food or drinks. After walking by us for the 6th or seventh time my fiancé actually said \"hello are we invisible? \" still no acknowledgement from the bartender. We promptly took our business across the street to Red Robin.  I would have said something to manager but didn't feel like waiting even longer. Do not recommend and will never bother to be back to try.   Bartender needs trained on attentiveness"}
{"text":"The Rail is an upscale burger/bar concept that started in 2011 with a single location in Fairlawn, Ohio's Summit Mall. The North Olmsted location opened in December of 2013 and there are already plans for a third in Canton. The Rail wears its local roots like a badge of honor and uses only locally-raised and butchered meats as well as locally-produced dairy in its menu.  The Rail has a look and feel that I'd described as urban cowboy chic. Wagon wheel chandeliers, retro auction signage and pictures of farm implements combined with black leather and natural wood make it both comfortable and a little classy. I thought the meat hooks hanging above the bar were an interesting stylistic choice. I personally found them tongue-in-cheek gruesome while I have a feeling that some might be a bit turned off. I say screw 'em if they can't take a joke. They also don't take your name when you arrive they assign you a name, in this case the name of an Ohio county. We got Hocking.  Speaking of food, The Rail is first and foremost a burger joint. It has a concise menu with a definite focus on the carnivorous. There are 11 signature burgers like the Local Yokel with Swiss cheese, thick-cut bacon and a fried egg and the Tourist, a friendly jab at outsiders that sports avocado spread, spinach and red pepper mayo. If eating things with eyes isn't your thing, there are a few options like a hummus pita and a selection of salads, but they do tend to get lost in the shuffle. Here it's all about the meat. I'd suggest that if you're vegetarian you stay away...far away.  The \"buy local\" behavior at The Rail even extends to the bar. The Rail features local wine, local whiskey and, my personal favorite, local craft beer. During my visit to the North Olmsted location they were featuring beer brewed by 15 different Ohio craft breweries. And another thing, every tap, all 24 of them, was filled with an Ohio-made beer. Now that's dedication to a cause. I'm not sure why you'd care given their draught selection, but there are also a couple of dozen bottled selections.   During my visit I ordered a flight and was disappointed when they were unceremoniously delivered to the table sans labeling of any kind on a plastic beer-soaked tray. First, I think that the 5-6oz glass tumblers they use are much too large for a flight and second, respect the damn beer, people. The product and the brewers deserve better than this. I'll chalk this up to new restaurant jitters and hope that they'll work out the kinks over the coming months.  I have to admit there are few things I enjoy more than a good burger, especially when it's grass-fed and local. My recent experience, however, was a bit underwhelming. Ordered medium, it was delivered just this side of rare. Don't get me wrong, I like a little pink, but when I can still hear the moo it probably needs a few more minutes on the grill. Cooking temperature aside, the flavor of the meat was excellent, well-seasoned with some nice grill marks.  The space is rather tight and during busy weekend nights the front lobby and waiting area can get a little cozy. To keep entertained while you wait catch the show under the stairs where you can watch the guys in the kitchen bust their asses on the grill. The main bar stretches the length of the first floor with big, comfy booths along the front wall and the second level mezzanine is host to additional table seating. I found the really high backs of the booth to be nice for privacy but a bit tough to look around if you wanted to scope out the rest of the space.  The service we experienced during our visit was probably the result of a perfect storm of events - it was a Saturday evening, during the Christmas holiday shopping season, and the restaurant was going on its second week of operation. If we had received stellar service I'd have been gobsmacked. Excuses aside, I found the service to be OK. We were greeted immediately when we arrived and had to wait only about 15 minutes, not bad. At the table things were a bit harried. Our server was very rushed, and distracted. He even commented at one point as he went to get our check \"I'll see you in an hour.\" There was also little done to showcase the concept or beer selection outside of a lightning-fast 10 second recitation that I really didn't catch.  The Rail is quickly making a name for itself in northeast Ohio and given the seemingly insatiable appetite their clientele has for craft beer and meat (present company included) my guess is that they will do just fine. I love the concept of \"all local\" and I especially love the all-Ohio beer taps selection. Hell, the beer alone is enough to draw me back in. Aside from a few minor \"young restaurant\" hiccups like missed cooking temperatures and harried service, the overall experience was a positive one. If these areas for improvement are ironed out, and I truly believe they will be, Ohio has just earned itself another keeper."}
{"text":"Justin is everything! Do yourself a favor and sit at the bar; Justin is consistently a class act and an authentic/knowledgeable beer-connoisseur! This restaurant knows its strengths and holds fastidiously to them; I've never had poor service here! I truly believe there is something to be said about a place that satisfies with local beer & organic meat selections (they even have a honestly delicious veggie burger, for vegetarians like myself), all while playing the best of 90's alternative and creating an overall chill spot to enjoy the game or seasonal selections, any day of the week!"}
{"text":"Great quality beef, awesome toppings and selection, good fries, too."}
{"text":"My husband and I had a great meal at The Rail. The service was very friendly and informative. I had the 7th Heaven burger, which came with truffle butter and thick cut bacon. It was delicious. I had it with a very nice saison. The only downside was that the restaurant was SO COLD! The skinny fries were shivering!   Still, a good meal!"}
{"text":"If you want to have a couple's date or just enjoy and great burger & brew, stop here! It sits next to the new Ohio Beer Garden but I have to say, once you sit down here, you won't want to go any where else."}
{"text":"Have been here several times. Great hamburgers.  However today I tried the mushroom app and the pork nachos app.  I was the first person in the restaurant at 11:10a for lunch which always make me wonder if they are ready in the back.  The mushrooms were nicely done crisp on outside with a ranch dipping sauce. There are 2 reasons why I took 1 star away. 1: the pork nachos were barely warm when served.  2: the restaurant was only about 1/2 full by the time I left and the noise level was unbearable. Every time I have eaten there the noise was unbearable. I will not be returning to the Rail because of that.  However I still give them a 4 star for excellent food. The nachos may have been cold the flavor of the pork was great."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a high quality burger, this is the spot. The burger was extremely juicy and flavorful.  The fries are good. The environment is nice and clean.   Would absolutely come again!"}
{"text":"Great affordable food. The only reason I wouldn't give five stars is because I was seated next to the door and people who were waiting were blocking my booth.   Other than that.... Great food! Great service!"}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of trying this place last year in November I believe. I am from Houston and boy was it a mistake coming here. You know when you have that one burger that ruins you for life with any other burger? You will find it here. If you don't live here, then don't go here. Every time I bite into a burger now, they all fall short to this place. Although I thank you for the great experience, I hate you for ruining my burgers everywhere else. Boy do I miss this place."}
{"text":"We were pretty near the Strongsville B Spot, and decided we wanted to go out for lunch. We had heard friends talk about The Rail, and decided to drive right past B Spot and head out to give The Rail a try.    I do like B Spot.   It's not really bad.   I was shocked by how much more I liked The Rail. Their burgers are seasoned well, and cooked to the requested temperature.   I got one of the specials of the month (a black and blue burger) and was pleasantly surprised.   Restaurants tend to be a little timid about using cajun seasoning, and that is not the case here.   My husband got the bacon/cheeseburger, and it was great.   Again, properly seasoned, no need to hide the patty under loads of sauce or anything else.   Our daughter had the chicken fingers, which were, again, great.      Our server (Justin, I think) was awesome.   Even though he was clearly the bartender, who was also serving tables, he had plenty of time to take care of our table.   He gave us the perfect amount of attention.   Brought fresh drinks without being asked, knew the menu, made suggestions, but he wasn't smothering.  We had an overall great experience, and really, we can't wait to stop back and try the next thing on the menu."}
{"text":"Coming from Chicago, where there are great burger joints all over, this place was not as good. Don't get me wrong, it was NOT bad, just not as good as Umami Burger, Kuma's Korner or The Lockdown...  Service was VERY good and knowledgeable on the different beverages available.  But, the flavor of the burger was not as I'd hoped..."}
{"text":"I had a burger and it was cooked to perfection. I would get the burger with the skinny fries. The shakes are also very good! Very good all around!"}
{"text":"Popped in on a Friday night, not that busy.  Server was great Got a Bonfire burger, which was flavorful with some heat - added some bacon which was mistakenly not originally included (EVERYTHING SHOULD COME WITH BACON) Sweet potato fries: good Shoestring fries: good Side salad: fine Finished with a Nutella crunch shake. Not much crunch, but was good - enough Nutella flavor to know it was there (so much Nutella-flavored stuff is so weakly Nutella'd).  Good meal"}
{"text":"I'd summarize The Rail as a B Spot with better furniture and atmosphere but where the burgers are not quite as tasty.  My Crouching Burger (Hidden Bacon) featured modestly thick slices of bacon hidden underneath a thick burger patty covered in Rail Sauce (not a great sauce; along the lines of barbecue sauce without the tanginess) and shredded pork shoulder.  The thick patty was probably the best part of the burger, though getting it cooked medium well--I was wary because of an undercooked \"medium\" burger I had at Kafeteria earlier in the week--was probably a mistake as the burger lacked some juiciness.  The bacon is thicker and better than what you'd get at most diner-type restaurant burgers but it doesn't stand out enough to be a major draw.  The worst aspect of the burger was the pork shoulder which was served significantly cooler than the patty, covering and dulling it like a wet blanket.  Overall, I'd likely go for one of the other burger options on a future visit.  The Skinny Fries, which are not an included side, are your basic shoestring french fries.  What I did really like about The Rail is their selection of 24 beers on draft from 14 Ohio breweries in addition to a pretty standard assortment of bottles.  Also, the restaurant environment had a pretty decent vibe, highlighted by a spacious bar and comfortable looking booths."}
{"text":"First time ever eating at The Rail. Food was excellent, the waitress was fantastic, and the manager superb. We had one burger that was cooked wrong, it was near raw in the middle. It happens, they took the burger back took it off our bill and gave my wife dessert on top of that. We will return again."}
{"text":"Let's cut to the chase, food is decent - okay, but nothing to run back to.   The nutella shake $6.50 is really tasty and the Gouda Mac & Cheese Bites $6.50 were good for a fried carb filled appetizer. The County Line Fried Chicken Sandwich $9.75 is pretty big, but lacking flavor. It was good after I added pepper jack cheese, extra coleslaw (they give you a micro portion), hot sauce, and some guac I had at home.   I placed an in-person take-out order with the hostess who was very personable and friendly. The décor is clean and hip, and there is plenty of parking since this place is on the outside of a mall. The food isn't bad, but I've only made it here twice in the two years I've lived on the west side if that tells you anything.     UPDATE** Customer service at The Rail is outstanding! They really care about how your experience was and genuinely listen when you offer suggestions. I tried them out again, this time for a Local Yokel Burger (added avocado) and a side of their house chips with dip. I am going to stick with the 3 star A-Ok rating because the food was good, but still not something that really stood out to me. I am however, more inclined to keep giving them a shot now because of their customer service and the monthly specials are appealing."}
{"text":"Oh, suburbia, with your malls and your chain restaurants... oh, um, wait. This isn't *really* a chain. Sure, it's not a one of a kind, but the best rarely stay that way.   And The Rail is one of the best, despite it being attached to a mall (next to a movie theater no less) and being firmly planted in suburbia.   I don't mean to sound so dang snobby about it. I've just gotten very used to the hipster crowds in Lakewood, Tremont, and Ohio City joints - which seem to also be where the best food is found, usually. This time, the mall - with the family dinner crowd - totally wins.   Our server was above and beyond fantastic, even when we screwed up his ordering system by deciding on an appetizer after we'd ordered our meals - he managed to make it work, and brought out the bacon sliders first... and despite the place being fully packed, he kept us happy the entire time.   And the food... As others have mentioned -- the whole deal is Ohio sourcing everything they can -- and yay for a yummy Ohio!   The bacon on the sliders might actually have been the tastiest bacon I've had. (I need to host a bacon tasting event... hmm...) The burger was near perfect (and baby, they will leave it as bloody as you'll take it!). Even the ranch dressing on my side salad was house made and better than most ranch dressings I've ever tasted. I tasted my friend's fries - he just stuck with the plain old skinny fries, but they were solidly good skinny fries.   Two complaints, but not food related ones... 1. There is very little room to wait for a table... and the wait was an hour long, so that kind of sucked. (But it was indeed worth the wait.) 2. It was very, very loud in there. Granted, they were packed (hello, one hour wait, prime dinner time on a Friday night) but still. I actually had ordered my burger medium rare, but all he heard was the rare. Didn't bother me much that the order was off a little, because yeah, I can get down with a bloody burger when it's good meat (and it was) -- but the noise level is what made it that way. Lots of families and kids and stuff...   Oh, suburbia."}
{"text":"Went here on a Friday and luckily beat the rush. Got a table for 6, and I must say that everyone loved every aspect. The service was superb, the beer selection was great including dozens of local brews, a few people got drink specials and loved them. Last but not least the food was great. Had the 7th heaven burger and fried pickles with the jalepano ranch both were pheonimal. Onion rings were great, and every loved their burgers. We were full but had to try the chocolate pecan pie which was great. We will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"We tried this place out yesterday after reading many good reviews.  Amazing!!!  This was the best burger I've had in years and my date agreed.  We could not stop being amazed at how good the beef tasted.   The menu says \"locally sourced Ohio beef\".  You can taste the difference!   We tried the onion rings (just ok, frozen, beer battered, run of the mill) and house made chips - good but greasy.  The sides are pricey.  Great cocktails and very reasonably priced.  Great selection of Ohio beers on tap.  The bartenders know their stuff and do a great job. The staff does an amazing job all around.    We cannot wait to go back.  If you are in the neighborhood and craving an incredible burger, run, don't walk to The Rail!"}
{"text":"Great burger. I mean really good. So why only 4 stars? $13 is a little steep for a burger. I don't care how good it is. Fries were excellent as well but again the prices were about 20% more than I'd like to pay for lunch. You cannot pay $20 each person for lunch. Again food was awesome though."}
{"text":"Really good burgers and beers. Awesome sides and apps. Love this place but it is pricey."}
{"text":"Good burger, great Smoked Gouda Mac-n-Cheese bites, and good service.  My fries were too salty but I believe that the waitress would have got me a better batch of fries, if would have requested it.  It's a nice burger joint and sports bar with a nice set of options for sandwiches.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"Love the set up and outdoor patio. Fast service and home grown food. Great lettuce wrap spicy burger and fries. Great price. Good place to stop after you see a movie in the new cinema."}
{"text":"Don't confuse this place for a mall restaurant. Okay, so it's attached to the mall and it's a restaurant, but it's more than that. The Rail is a burger/bar that offers a concise, affordable menu, a plethora of booze, clean, sleek decor, and just enough character to not get lost in the burger joint crowd. That character revolves around local. The meat is local. The booze is local. Everything is local.  The best thing about this place for me was the service. We sat at the bar because we didn't want to wait for a table, and all of the bartenders were really nice, attentive, and pretty much on the ball in every way. Not only that, there was a ridiculous amount of servers around the whole restaurant. It's refreshing to see a properly staffed restaurant that doesn't stretch a handful of servers too thin across a bunch of tables.  For the food, I went with the \"Crouching Burger, Hidden Bacon\". A giant beef patty topped with a flat fried wonton and pulled pork, with a few strips of bacon tucked underneath it all. It's the \"meatlover's\" of burgers, and it didn't disappoint in that regard. The pulled pork, good. Bacon, good. The patty itself was tender, flavorful, and juicy, although a bit undercooked. One bite and the bun was already soaked through and dripping into a puddle on my plate, so that wasn't very fun, but it was still very delicious. Also, it definitely could have used some veggies or sauce to contrast all that meat. Still though...  a much, much better burger than B-spot, oh no he didn't.  I also had a side of sweet potato fries with chipotle mayo. These were alright, but the fries were overcooked. For dessert, we shared a nutella crunch milkshake that left me wondering where they got the nutella and the crunch from because it certainly wasn't in the shake. Don't get me wrong, it was a good milkshake, but it really just tasted like chocolate cereal that melted into the milk. My guess is they just blended up a bunch of the chocolate wafers they use to top the shake and mixed it into a regular shake. If they did use nutella, they didn't use enough of it.  Overall though I enjoyed my meal and my experience here. I'd definitely return for more burger action and to try out some of the brews."}
{"text":"We got the recommendation from our shuttle driver to try out The Rail, and I'm so glad we did. From the second you walk in you're greeted with nice friendly people. The restaurant is very modern looking and in a way industrial. They've got a great music selection playing. I built my own burger and I have to say it was one of the best burgers I've ever had! Meat was cooked perfectly and the toppings were fresh and flavorful. We decided to sit at the bar because it was open and we were there for a quick lunch. Katie was behind the bar and provided some of the best service ever! Just don't forget dessert. I got one of the shakes and my oh my it was amazing. To get a great tasting big burger and a hand made shake for $20 is in my mind a great price for freshness and friendly service. I will definitely have to stop by next time I'm in Cleveland. Well done The Rail crew."}
{"text":"The best burger I have ever had.  When ever I travel to Ohio from Canada,  The Rail is a must.  This is a sit down and enjoy burger experience.  It is simply the best gourmet burger I have had anywhere.  Everything is locally sourced, nothing is corporately tweaked or penny pinched.  Ohio's own stadium mustard sits on every table to compliment your burger.   The management listens to all comments on comment cards and has actually made improvements based on suggestions I made which is very flattering.    It's very fortunate that two of my favorite places, The Rail & Brown Bag Burgers are literally around the corner from each other.  One is a lunch style take-out burger joint and the other a gourmet knock your socks off burger.    The crouching burger is my favorite as it is salty, sweet, with a bit of crunch from a wonton.  Whatever you get,  GET Ohio thick cut bacon on it.  And how do they get that perfect char on the outside of the burger?  Amazing every time. Be prepared for a wait during prime time and weekends.  The Rail secret is out."}
{"text":"I have to say their burgers are top notch. Very tasty flavorful juicy burgers with a number of interesting toppings that just blend together for an excellent flavor. Everything is bought from local Ohio businesses which is cool. Now you are going to pay a lot more for a burger than your standard burger place but I would personally say I would be willing to pay a little more for something really tasty. Now if they raised the prices any more I would start to say no as they are at the height of what I am willing to pay for a burger."}
{"text":"Love the milk shakes and the local hotel yokel burger. The wife got sweet potato fries and they were a little burnt but our waitress,  Kimberly, noticed and took care of the problem right away.  Great food and great service."}
{"text":"I'm sorry Five Guys, you are now #2 on my list for having the best burgers in town.   The Rail's burgers are so flavorful! The burger patty is a very decent size so, I think you get your money's worth. The bun is soft & buttered...buttered buns & a flavorful burger = an insanely good burger. You honestly don't need much toppings on it but I did get cheese, mushrooms, & sautéed onions.   The fries are also good! I can't wait to try a milkshake the next time I go back too."}
{"text":"Great service and even better food. Would have like to have scene a better beer selection and a bigger menu. But aside from those small imperfections the place is great will go back for sure."}
{"text":"It was just ok. Nothing special, really kind of overpriced for what you get. I have no reason to return."}
{"text":"First rate burgers! Our first time at The Rail. Everything was really great. I had an Ohio Mule that was the best I ever had. We can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Best burgers in the area, but if you want a treat the grilled Caesar salad is a great item.  All locally grown and raised ingredients"}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't written a review here yet. Maybe it's because I was too busy hoovering down the delicious food here! I've been here 3 times since it's opened and can't bring myself to order anything different each time. I am a huge fan of the local yokel - a 1/2 local beef burger served with thick-cut bacon, Swiss, and a fried egg on top. I eat the whole thing every time. As a side to that, I get a side of the truffle fries. I am going to make a bold statement here, so brace yourselves...I like these truffled fries BETTER than Lola fries. Sorry Michael Symon, there's just something about the truffle oil and Parmesan cheese on top of skinny, crispy fries that just gets me every time.  The vibe at the rail is casual and the upper level would be good for a large group like an after-work happy hour. You wouldn't expect all of these great qualities at a restaurant that's connected to a mall, but I'm telling you, it's amazing! Check it out!!!"}
{"text":"I had their Blue Bessie Burger and was a little disappointed by the appearance of my burger when it arrived. As a bleu cheese lover, I was anticipating a burger visibly dripping with bleu cheese sauce. While the meat looked yummy and the spinach was beautiful, there wasn't any bleu cheese visible.  However, the moment I put that sandwich into my mouth, my disappointment melted away, as the flavors were perfectly proportioned. This was one of the most delicious burgers I've had in a very long time and I will definitely return!  On a side note, the server apparently forgot to place my order for a side of onion rings (despite the fact it was her idea to get them!), so they didn't arrive with my burger. However, she apologized and comped them, and they arrived very quickly after that."}
{"text":"My Husband and I were here again today for lunch.  They have changed their menu.  It all sounded wonderful.  They have tater tots that are made in house.  They are wonderful and creamy but crispy on the outside.  They have been and continue to be my favorite place for a good food and consistent service.  Keep up the awesome job!!...."}
{"text":"We like to try new places!  The service was very good, friendly waiter. The Rail Burger was excellent, but the truffle fries did not do it for us. Strange taste and with over $6 outrageous expensive. We were scammed on a tiny table, barely large enough to fit our 2 plates, although the restaurant was almost empty, which I found surprising on a Friday evening. The ambiance was not to our liking, I don't like these extreme high ceilings. And in general, for a place that sells mostly burgers it is way too expensive. No burger under $10 and fries have to be ordered extra."}
{"text":"One of the most hyped up burger bar ever.  I had the 7th heaven burger and I must say I was greatly disappointed with not only the size of the burger for what you pay but the service was so so as well.  I really wanted to like this place but they don't know the definition of medium well as they burned my brothers burger and mine was well done even though we both ordered medium well.  Had their sweet potato fries which were nothing to scream about .  I had a Strawberry milk shake and it was similar to a mcdonald's shake except with a higher price tag and you get less.  It gets two stars for the decor for which it saved it from being a one star."}
{"text":"I was unimpressed.  My burger arrived in a puddle of melted butter and grease. The bartender was just ok. The quality of the ingredients used however (meat, buns) were Excellent so I may give it another try. But I won't order the same thing."}
{"text":"My biggest pet peeve is taking a bite of a burger, only to have the burger and toppings shift in between the buns and eventually fall. This does not happen at The Rail. The buns are firm and all elements of the burger remain intact as a receptacle of deliciousness for your mouth. I ordered the Crouching Burger (Hidden Bacon) and it was juicy with the bacon, pork and crispy wonton all making oscar worthy appearances.  The appetizers were also very tasty. I got the fried pickles and fried gouda cheese bites - although both fried, they felt surprisingly healthy as a consequence of fresh, local OH ingredients and lack of grease. The addition of the dill in the fried pickles was marvelous and toned down the tart of the pickle."}
{"text":"So the waiter comes to the table and asks if we've been there before.  When we say no, he says, 'sorry for your loss.'  Then he nearly breaks his arm patting himself on the back for the ohio raised beef. And hand dipped shakes. I couldn't give a shit where my burger lived before it got to me. Hand dipped shakes? Those are just words, they mean nothing to me. I order a burger with an egg on it.  This idea was not invented at the rail, believe it or not. Supposed to be over easy, that means a runny yolk. Not so much. All in all, the burger was good.  But a whopper is good too. Get over yourself rail."}
{"text":"Well. Came in - said we were in a hurry to make a movie on time. Were told that was ok. Waited 25 minutes after ordering to get one sandwich and fries. Asked for it to go because it took so long. Came out COLD. Brought it up to server and she said \"well I can't help that everyone came in at once\". I replied with \"and that's the excuse for why it's cold?\"  She told me to have a nice day and walked away. Didn't even offer to warm it , remake it or bring it to anyone's attention.  Called shortly after to speak to a manager and was told they were too busy. So here's the post. What a waste. And didn't even get a refill of iced tea during the 30 min of waiting for cold food.  Even tried to get hostess or bartenders attention on way out to talk. Hostess could not be found and bartender walked on by. Oh, and only about 5-6 tables had people at them so they were not busy. Do not recommend."}
{"text":"Fries were cold and shoestring fries. My medium temp Burger was hot and good. Sat at the bar and bartender didn't come by and see if all was alright until my Local Yokal  was finished. The manager seems real hands on. I seen him taking plates from tables and was doing a bathroom check when I was inside and he was cleaning the sink. Warm fries that have \"more meat on their bones\" would be nice.  Otherwise not bad, good beer selection"}
{"text":"I took my one year old here with my mom for lunch. We ordered a salad a burger and Mac and cheese. We waited over an hour for our food. I had to go ask the manager twice where our food was. We got my daughter chicken nuggets. The kids meals are $5+ and they gave her two small chicken fingers."}
{"text":"Seriously good burgers - they are juicy, well-seasoned and not overly greasy. My sister got the Mojo burger, which is the monthly special right now, and it was delish. They make a mean sweet potato fry (like, among the best SP fries on this earth) and when I've ordered bacon on my burger its always been a thick, crispy slice of goodness. Tobacco onions, red onion jam and the chipotle mayo - they pay attention to the details when it comes to toppings and sides. Stuff is fresh! My least favorite thing I had here was a slice of peach blueberry pie - the pie crust was soggy and I just wasn't into the flavor combo. If you are looking for something sweet, stick with the milkshakes (although nothing can top B-Spot's Bacon Apple Pie, right?)  On to the beer. I have to give the edge (over B-Spot) to The Rail here for their beer selection. They make a serious effort to maintain an all-Ohio tap list, and not just stuff from the big guys - they had brews from Franklin Brewing out in Elyria and Four String Brewing down in Columbus on draft yesterday. And pints of Jackie O's Razz Wheat for $2! Brought on some nostalgia for sure. The bottle list is respectable too - a lot of solid standbys for the less adventurous. They have this \"Beer Exploration Society\" program featuring appetizers and tastings from a different brewery each month for $12, I think. Needless to say, beer is a priority here. Although based on our experience, not everyone on the staff is as well-versed on beer stuff as they probably should be. A couple months ago they had Spacewalker listed on their draft list, and when I asked if they still had it, our waiter looked at me like I was speaking in tongues. Well, maybe I was.  This location is much bigger than its Fairlawn counterpart, but service has still been consistently attentive and friendly. The servers have been on point in terms of knowing the menu and accommodating requests. For the service, emphasis on local products, and well-executed burgers, I gotta give them five stars."}
{"text":"nice environment, cool design. has an upstairs, a small patio, and a little bar area with the finest selection of ohio beers on tap.  the burger was pretty good, although I ordered medium and it was more so medium well. it's on a good bun and the beef is good quality. then again, it's hard to mess up a good burger cuz it's just so easy to make. I also ordered the $7 truffle butter fries which were tasty, but I wasn't blown away by them.   the negative about them is they are kinda overpriced for a burger joint. you're spending $10-12 for a burger, and then you're paying $3-7 extra for fries, plus another $5 for a beer. so let's say in date situation, you watch a movie and then go to the rail afterwards, that's $100 you're spending on a date right there.   I would go here again though because of the nice atmosphere, but I would go here more if food items were 2-3$ less expensive and if they had a killer ass happy hr with some decently priced craft beers."}
{"text":"Very good food- all local so definite plus. We had the Sriracha fries appetizer which was pretty good, I had. Black cow (root beer float with chocolate sauce- yum!) and a loaded rail burger with a fried egg and house made chips, he had some kind of burger with bacon and three kinds of onions plus onion rings. All of our food was great, but we were full before we ever made a dent in the sides! A tip- ask for the pickles on the side, because the chips on the bottom got a tad soggy from pickle and burger juice."}
{"text":"don't even want to give them a start to be honest. we got seated and ordered a veggie burger and onion rings. Gave us a tortilla wrap burger instead with tomatoe and lettus that we DIDNT want. bad service. all she said was she was sorry and gave our meal for free. never going back again"}
{"text":"Highly recommend this place. The burger and fries I had were so good and tasted very fresh! They had a great beer selection that I wish I could have tried out also."}
{"text":"Go for the burgers . . . no wait . . . go for the fries . . . no wait . . . the burgers.  The Rail serves, by far, the best burgers around.  And, if for some silly reason, you don't want to have a burger, get the Southwest Chop Salad.    The people working there are incredibly friendly and helpful.  The portion sizes are good.    My biggest complaint is the size of the place."}
{"text":"The prices are outrageous for a hamburger!  The beer prices too.   But have to make up the higher rent by overcharging for average food.  Not bad just and overpriced for my liking and think you can do better at a local bar restaurant.  I assume the Movie crowd is what them aim for, so if convenience is important, go for it."}
{"text":"Fantastic from start to finish. In terms of environment the whole restaurant is sort of butcher to the kitchen themed. They're all about locally sourced ingredients and beer. The food is ala carte gourmet burgers, bar food, and beer. Great beer specials: $2 Edmund Fitzgerald and Sierra Nevada & 3$ long islands on Friday. The beer selection was enormous and they had 20 draft handles. The food was excellent. I chose the mojo which is the special of the month. Andouille sausage and ground beef party with peppers and spicy sauce. They also have thin cut fries. Overall I HIGHLY recommend the spot."}
{"text":"This was a typical burger joint. I gave them an extra star for having veggie burgers on the menu. Since I wasn't alone, we compromised and decided to visit this gem that sits on the side of the Great Northern Mall. Our hotel was across the street, so it was convenient.   I ordered the veggie burger with fries. It was quite delicious. I was impressed. It wasn't some hard patty. My tastebuds were happy!! If I am ever in the area again, I would consider visiting even though I'm not a meat eater anymore."}
{"text":"I ordered the Rail with Cheese for takeout. The bun was perfectly toasted and then burger was cooked medium rare--perfection. It was juicy and had the right amount of saltiness. The place looked a little dead when I walked in during lunch hour -- y'all need to get to the Rail and support local businesses! You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Good burger joint. Probably would've given it 3.5 stars if I could. Flavor on burgers was pretty bland but the other toppings and sauces made up for it. Allow you to select from medium rare to well done. Felt like my \"medium done\" was probably closer to well done. Only complaint would be the patty shape. May be an odd complaint but they were super thick but they are small in diameter so you end up taking several bites of bun before you even get to the meat. Shakes were also pretty decent. Burger options were plentiful with at least 15 different burgers on the menu. Service was great and quick but maybe that's because we went on a Thursday night at 5pm. If you're lookin for a decent burger and shake place, I'd recommend it."}
{"text":"The rail was very a great surprise! Their locally grown food was delicious and fresh. I tried the Philippe Burger and the Grilled Chicken Club. It was very fresh and healthy for an american grill. The restaurant had a modern feel inside and was very clean. The service was excellent and quick. I would have liked it if the entrees came with a side of fries. The side of fries cost extra and were smaller portions. I recommend trying the strawberry shake for dessert."}
{"text":"Been there a couple times,  the burgers are wonderful and priced well.   The staff are very friendly and willing to help with good suggestions. I look forward for my next visit."}
{"text":"Definitely a 4.5 --  Nice atmosphere. Packed on a Thursday evening. Always a good sign. I love the idea of an All-Ohio based business. Ohio beers, spirits, meats and dairies.   My husband grabbed the Gouda Mac and cheese bites for an appetizer - absolutely out of this world! I only snagged a bite but they were fantastic!   I got the Perfectly Naked -- absolutely love that there is a low carb option which is one of the reasons we picked Rail. I added sautéed onions and the red onion jam, plus a fried egg. Everything was absolutely delicious but I definitely feel like I missed out on the experience without the bun. Totally want to give it another try on a day I'm feeling less health conscious!   My husband got the Crouching Burger. He said the bacon was everything the reviews promised and promptly quoted Pulp Fiction that \"this is a tasty burger.\" I tried a little piece of the shredded pork, and I honestly wasn't impressed by that but I'm sure it tasted okay on the burger itself.   Really nice beer selection, although the thought of paying $7.50 for one beer makes me cringe. 2 burgers, 1 appetizer, and 4 beers came to $60 which seems a little steep. Probably won't order drinks the next time we go, because it's a fine value otherwise.   The service was great - with one exception. We didn't get checked on at any point during the middle of our meal, and I could have used some extra mayo. In fairness, our server was either training someone or in training (couldn't tell which was which) and it was pretty busy. BUT otherwise, friendly, knowledgeable and prompt with taking our order, getting the check etc.  Will be back"}
{"text":"Great appetizers.   The Mac & Cheese bites were amazing.   I also highly recommend the Nutella crunch shake.   I ate with a group of  3.  We each had different burgers & tasted each other's & they were all excellent.    Our one complaint, collectively, was that the burgers were a little more cooked than what we had asked for.   But besides that, really delicious."}
{"text":"Been here twice. Nachos are outstanding, although portion size is super small. I still recommend them. First burger I had was ok... had the local yokal second visit and was amazing. Highly recommend. Rivals Michael Symon B-spot (same prices too FYI)"}
{"text":"I have ate here before and I have never been disappointed! All the items on the menu come from the State of Ohio. The menu consists and starters, burgers & sandwiches and sides. There are plenty of great burgers to choose from. I have had 4 to 5 different items on the menu and all have been great. All their beers on tap come from Ohio. You can buy growlers, t-shirts and pint glasses here as well. For desserts, their milkshakes are so good! I would come in and get a milk shake to go! The place is small, so during busy hours, the wait can get long but it's worth it!! Please stop in and check them out!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went to the rail for a Friday night date night. We met at around 6:15 and we were seated within ten minutes. I got the bonfire burger- it definitely tasted so fresh!!! Very filling. It was super spicy, just how I like it.   They have an amazing selection of craft beers that are exclusive to Ohio! Such a nice touch to the restaurant. Service was great. She recommended I try the peanut butter brownie shake and I think my life changed for the better after that one. Definitely one of the best milkshakes I've ever had.   The decor is amazing. I love the string lights. I love how they love Ohio so much and keep everything local. We will definitely"}
{"text":"Fantastic new addition to the food scene on the west side. Their menu is entirely locally sourced - Ohio beef and pork. The staff is extremely friendly and knowledgeable despite this location being very new. The food is FANTASTIC. Favorite so far is the Local Yokel burger, but I have loved everything I have tried there. Highly recommend...."}
{"text":"The chow is tasty and the servers are nice. Our experience was let down by understaffing and some lack of focus on the part of the staff. Indeed, it was very busy, but the waits had as much to do with tables not being turned quickly and orders not being taken promptly as they did with the crowd. Based on the well-seasoned burgers and properly cooked sides, the kitchen seems to know what they're doing. I hope the rest of the staff catches up."}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this place because of all the great things I've heard and read. Unfortunately, my Rail burger with cheese was super salty. I couldn't eat it all. Two others at the table also commented that their burgers were too salty. The fries had a nice seasoning and the people who had salads said they were good.   Also, even though the waiter did what he had to do, he kept making jokes almost like he was drunk. The redeeming qualities were the atmosphere and the philosophy of local ingredients. I'm willing to try this place again because maybe this was just an anomaly night."}
{"text":"i don't know what all the hoopla about this place is about......apps and burgers are just GOOD, NOTHING SPECIAL, NOTHING MEMORABLE, even a bit on the dry side (and mine was ordered medium rare). i've had better burgers in dive bars.....compared to fast food burgers, then yes, they're great, but not compared to other places i've eaten. service is friendly and sometimes absent, inside is kind of cool and kind of cold at the same time....i don't know......just NOT great enough to go back......there are better options around town that feature better burgers."}
{"text":"Was not a fan of this place. I got the sweet potato fries with my burger and they were soggy and tasteless. The menu is deceiving because everything sounds so good but it ended up being less delicious than expected. I had the crouching burger that had a crispy wonton on it and it was a bad combination. Their special sauce that comes with it is nothing special. I really wish this place was better."}
{"text":"Update on my initial review: This has become my go to burger place on the Westside.  I appreciate the management's comment on pricing reflecting local sourcing. I've been there at least 10 times in the last few months and will continue to come in.  I find that the price is worth the quality of the food. The milkshakes are great, the drink specials, cheap.  Service is usually very good but I've had two experiences where they change shifts and my table falls into purgatory where no one comes to take the check.  The last time, I just left cash and left.  Overall, still a fan but will stick to the bar area."}
{"text":"Awesome place!!  Not only great food but awesome place to get your favorite Ohio booze. Whether you're looking for light and delicious salads to delectable burgers you won't be disappointed. Absolute favorite was the Gouda Mac n cheese bites. The bf and I both agreed we could just get a few orders of those and enjoy our beverages. Oh yeah about those. Let's talk about booze baby...Ohio liquors, Ohio beers, and Ohio Cider. Yum yum yum!!! My favorite of course is cider!  The only cider works in the Ohio that I know of is Griffin Cider Works. Griffin is a small start up out of Westlake, Ohio slowly growing his reach in NEO and I was ultimately pleased to see them here at The Rail. I cannot express how awesome it was to walk in and get acquainted with what The Rail is all about. Local everything! Beers and spirits from Cincinnati, Columbus, Cleveland and everywhere in between. 24 taps of Ohio brews lagers and ales you can't go wrong here. The staff was accommodating and warm. This was our first time here and we felt like we were friends sitting down for a burger and some beer. Great place!!"}
{"text":"Wow, probably one of the best burger spots I've ever been to. I'm from south Florida where Fuddruckers is my fav, but this place blows it and all other burger spots out of the water. Burgers come with all types of unique and quirky toppings, there is a fantastic beer selection on tap, great service, and importantly for me, extremely reasonable pricing!"}
{"text":"My wife told me about this newly opened burger restaurant next to the new Regal Cinema  'Google plex' movie theatres that recently opened up.  Little did I know that 'dinner and the movies' would turn out to be so perfect last night!   This place is visually fantastic, and very inviting and laid back!  The interesting and well-done (no pun intended) decor is one of a classic American west chophouse meets saloon, with huge, way tall, pleated leather high-back booths, and polished concrete floors.  Wheeled meat hooks on a rail loom above the adjacent long bar, reminding you of the origins of your burger.  Even the unique wagon wheel chandeliers have many hanging light bulbs for that 'unfinished look'.  Very cool!  On to the grub- the burgers were INCREDIBLE!  As good as, if not better than Symon's 'B-Spot'!  Quite possibly the BEST burger I have had in all my 5 decades alive!  And that's saying a lot!  From what we were told, most everything is sourced locally from farms in Ohio (hopefully the meat is antibiotic and hormone-free; see below).  Even most of the beers and ales are locally brewed as well.  The Gouda Mac 'n Cheese bites were so tasty (they come with a spicy buffalo ranch sauce for dipping), as were the string fries (onion rings were mediocre though).  They should offer thicker steak fries too.  Our server, Lacy, was very professional and funny as well.  All in all, a great experience!  It's great to see a truly unique, world-class burger joint here in North Olmsted!  We will be back!  By the way, expect a half-hour or so wait on a weekend evening.  Best to go on a weekday if you don't want to wait.  On another important side note, I have recently learned a lot about meat quality here in America, and am sincerely hoping that 'The Rail' sources it's meat from farms that offer organically-raised, grass-fed or pastured meats.  The problem is antibiotics and hormones now so prevalent in our American meats.  For example, Ractopamine is a drug that increases protein synthesis, making the animal more muscular, which reduces the fat content of the meat and increases the profit per animal.  These drugs have been used in US cattle production since 2003.  Ractopamine is administered in the days leading up to slaughter, and as much as 20 percent of it can remain in the meat you buy.  Animal research has linked Ractopamine to reductions in reproductive function, birth defects, increase of mastitis in dairy herds, and increased disability and death. FDA records show 'death' is the most-often reported side effect.  The Center for Food Safety, together with the Animal Legal Defense Fund recently sued the FDA, maintaining it is illegally withholding records pertaining to Ractopamine's safety.  Ractopamine has been banned in almost every other country (160 of them) but the U.S.!  Food for thought..."}
{"text":"Me and my fiance's go to place for burgers. After trying brown bag burgers then fat heads burgers we didn't expect to find anything better- but we were wrong. These are the best burgers I've had in my entire life (sorry dad). 10/10 would recommend. If you like spicy food PLEASE try the better bonfire and their sweet potato fries with chipotle sauce (I'm drooling just thinking about it)."}
{"text":"If the worse thing you can say about a place is they're overly obsessed with the \"local/sustainable\" craze, then I'll say they have the full annoying obsession. I almost expect to find a couple of cows and chickens in the Great Northern parking lot just so they can tout their locality. I personally don't care if my chicken was in a North Olmsted garage or an Alabama farm before it got to the plate as long as it's good. And the chicken sandwich here is about as good as it gets. So I say try it."}
{"text":"I tried this place back when it opened about 4 years ago and was not that impressed. Since then, several people I know have tried the newest location in Strongsville and have had nothing but good stuff to say. So finally I made it back out. I must say the beer list was fabulous! Many beers I like and a few I've never had! Tried a new beer out of Dayton that was very delicious! Then we started with the truffle fries, which were tasty but after about three bites, found a hair which was very disturbing, it looked like it was a pet hair. The waiter, William, was concerned and attentive about the situation, made it clear it was taken off my bill and would send another out immediately! He then took caution over asking me when and if I was ready to order more food. We got the second round of fries, which we ate and enjoyed. I overcame the hair and ordered a naked burger, (which mainly means without the bun and limited toppings) and ordered it with avocado slices. It was a very tasty burger and super light bc it was without a bun and only lighter toppings. I also ordered a second beer and he only charged me 9 bucks for my burger. So although I give my experience a three, customer service and the way a bad situation was handled would be rated closer to a five!!!"}
{"text":"What TERRIFIC burgers!  And the best, lightly dusted, fried dill pickles anywhere!!!  I'd like to try other items but so far can't resist one of their many luscious, huge burgers!  The service is also attentive and friendly.  This is a terrific informal dining venue!"}
{"text":"This place is top notch all the way. Great service, great burgers, and great (Ohio) beers. 5 stars"}
{"text":"Extremely great food. But I am HIGHLY dissatisfied with the change of hands there. The staff that opened the restaurant was absolutely amazing!"}
{"text":"Came here on a whim last weekend and I'm sure glad we did. Everything here is Ohio themed and I love it! All the beers are ohio brewed and most all (if not all) of the food is sourced form Ohio as well. I thought a crafty touch was that instead of taking your name while you wait for your table they give you an Ohio county on a sticker and that is how they call you for your table.   Half of the tables are upstairs in a loft like setting which is different for this area. This restaurant definitely does not belong attached to a mall!  Burgers and sides are the deal here, not much else. Reading the reviews I ordered my burger medium instead of medium rare (most reviews sad burgers are undercooked) and I was so glad I did. My bf ordered medium rare and it was more on the rare side. I can't remember the name of my burger but it has cheddar, BBQ sauce, and onion straws. I loved it, like top five. The sweet potato fries were okay but I wasn't a fan of the chipotle mayo it came with. The kettle chips were just okay. Just when I think northeast Ohio is starting to swarm with burger joints, another great one pops up!"}
{"text":"Probably my favorite place to go and get a legit good burger. The burgers don't make me feel gross after eating them. If you go you HAVE  to try the bonfire fries... they are to die for! Service is always excellent and management is always welcoming :) highly highly recommend."}
{"text":"An outright burger restaurant that backs up their mission statement (fresh, local, sustainability, etc.)! Their version of a bacon and egg cheeseburger, the Local Yokel does stand out. It's just flat out delicious. With a side of the truffle fries, fans of the classic burger and fries combo will like this place a lot!   This location benefits from having a good-sized movie theater right around the corner. The rail is a great spot to have pre and post movie discussions! A formidable craft beer menu doesn't hurt the cause either!"}
{"text":"Literally the best burgers and fries I've ever had! Every time we go to the rail everything is always delicious. I've never had one bad thing. The burgers are so tasty and so is the local chicken sandwich. The skinny fries are out of this world! And the cherry pie milkshake was to die for! They also have an awesome kids menu and give the kids cool temporary tattoos!"}
{"text":"My better half was craving a really good burger - you know, the kind that is thick and messy and really good. The Rail was mentioned in a 'Cleveland's Best Burgers' article, so we decided to give it a try. We were not disappointed.  The menu is built around burgers - unique burgers, build-it-yourself burgers, bunless burgers. The cool thing is that you can substitute a chicken breast or veggie burger for the beef burger in any of the menu items. As someone who doesn't eat beef, this was an important find.  They also have some interesting appetizers. We tried the homemade chips with blue cheese crumbles and truffle oil - delicious. Next time, we will try the sweet potato fries. It's definitely a good place to try something new every time.   The Rail's alcohol selection is impressive. They have beer, wine, mixed drinks, you name it. They also have homemade shakes and floats - some in combinations you might not have tried before. And they have the standard sodas.   It's an upscale casual restaurant. I like the ambience - clean, cool decorations, etc. I personally am not a fan of the big screen TVs playing sports stuff, but that is a popular feature in this kind of establishment. We went on a Saturday early evening and didn't have to wait to be seated. Our food came quickly and our waitress was attentive.  Getting back to the burgers, it's really important that they do them right since everything revolves around them. I'd say they do a pretty darn good job. Expect to pay for this excellent burger - most of them were in the $9-11 range. Expect to pay extra if you want fries or anything besides the burger and a pickle spear. No matter what you get, there's a good chance it's locally-sourced.   The Rail gets a 5-star rating from me because let's face it - it's an epic eating experience. Our food was delicious, they had lots of different foods to try, their staff was friendly and attentive, the restaurant was clean, the ambiance was great, and they support the local economy by buying local - we will go back!  I recommend The Rail as a great place to eat for couples, groups, and individuals who are looking for a good burger (chicken breast and veggie burger substitution available) and appetizers that are a little different than what they've tried before."}
{"text":"The Rail is just okay. It has the makings of B Spot, but isn't as good. I recently tried a milk shake hoping hat would compare to B Spot, but didn't either. I also feel like their happy hour is a bit stingy ending at 6pm. I've had the BLT sliders which are good. Nothing else really sticks out in my mind."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem, totally worth a drive if you love burgers. Better than B Spot. Little expensive but it's all Ohio beef so I guess that makes it worth it? Beer selection and drinks are on point. Service is hit or miss but it's a small place so even with a bad server you'll be alright. I wouldn't recommend for larger groups just because of its size and wait time. Ample parking because it's in the mall and during the week you can usually sit right down."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a drink on a Sunday and we both wished we would have stopped in for dinner too after seeing the menu.   We sat at the bar and the service was great. It was very busy because the Sunday was that we stopped in was the night of the bicentennial fireworks.   We will definitely stop in for food soon and I will review the food as well. The beers were all local and delicious."}
{"text":"Found The Rail by accident when the TV's at Harry Buffalo were not showing NCAA basketball Saturday night. Did a search for sports bars and the Rail came up. Interesting they don't come up when hamburger restaurants are searched.  Traveling on business and came back the following day.   They pride themselves on Ohio sourced. Turns out Ohio meat and beer are pretty darn good. Mike, the server and bartender was excellent; extremely knowledgable, and fun. Samples are available free before you commit to a pint of beer. Mike will hone into your taste and you'll order a pint after your first or second taster.  This is a burger bar and the burgers are very good and tasty. Four of 5 of us ordered medium rare and one medium well, (not really a burger guy) Call me a traditionalist, I like mine with cheese, lettuce, onion, tomato. On Yelpers recommendation got the bacon and certainly glad I did. GET THE BACON! Went out on the limb and went crazy and oreered a side of Chipolte Mayo. The bun was buttered and toasted and held up to the meat. The star gets knocked off for consistency. The 4 medium rare burgers were all a different temperature ranging from 125 to 138 judging by color. Next time I'll order 125. We will go back this week to try the original Rail at the Summit Mall.  Onion rings and frys were OK not great The wedge salad was excellent. A half head of iceberg with bacon and blue cheese. Very fresh, cold, and crunchy.  Finished with a Brandy Alexander milkshake with Ohio Ice Cream. Mike apologized he couldn't garnish with fresh ground nutmeg. The combination dessert-after dinner drink was the perfect ending."}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite places to eat. They had my favorite burger on special for the weekend, The Lumberjack. This burger has 2 eggs, bacon, a burger on top of Texas toast with SYRUP!!!! Yep, I said it... It's one of the best burgers they serve. You guys need to keep that on the menu all the time!! The service was fast and amazing. We will keep coming back for more every time."}
{"text":"This is a fun casual place to take a date before a movie or shopping, but also appropriate for families too. The beer list has great Ohio based selections, many from NEO. My favorite thing I've had on the menu are the onion rings, which come with a unique red pepper sauce that I would personally slather on anything."}
{"text":"There is a sign in the Men's bathroom here that reads: \"Anyone whose favorite burger joint isn't in their hometown is a sissy\".  If you live near the Rail and it's not your favorite place for a burger, this is a true maxim indeed.          Don't let the kitschy suburban-hell location of being attached to a mall deter you - this is a legit well crafted local joint that you'd expect to find in Tremont or Ohio City, or even the LES in NYC.  My wife and I have grabbed here on many occasions, some carryout but mostly dining-in, and we've never had a bad experience.  The staff are friendly and quick, the decor is comfortable and cool, the drinks are awesome, and the food, well - incredible.        You can't go wrong with any of the burgers here - they are all crafted so damn well and delicious.  From the buns, to the toppings, to the meat - everything is great and comes together beautifully.  However, my singular favorite menu item at the Rail is their fried mac and cheese ball appetizer. Fried.Mac.And.Cheese. Nothing else is really necessary to expand upon on that one.  Do it.        The Rail is an excellent spot to catch up with friends over some truly awesome burgers or just grab a quick appetizer and drink at the bar. You will not be disappointed, I guarantee it - as the Men's Wearhouse Guy would say."}
{"text":"This is my second visit but I only checked in once.  The 1st visit was very good and the food was outstanding.   The 2nd visit not so good. The burgers were ordered medium and came out burnt. I don't send food back so we just dealt with it.  The milkshake were not thick and was like drinking a glass of flavored milk. Don't know if I will visit again, although I might try one more time.  I give 3 Stars because the Servers are always outstanding!!"}
{"text":"On the way to the mall, I stumbled upon this burger gem. Being a burger snob, this place has exceptional ingredients used on their burgers. High quality meat, and amAzing combinations. I'm definitely coming back. Also amazing drink specials. Can't wait to come back"}
{"text":"Seriously had one of the best burgers in my life here. Would have given 5 stars if they could make a good Long Island."}
{"text":"Stopped In for lunch after a trip to the mall with my girlfriend. It's a real nice place, friendly staff and good service. We shared a couple of burgers, the crouching burger and the bootlegger burger. They were fantastic. The sweet potato fries and onion rings are great as well. It's a bit more expensive then some places but you definitely get your money's worth in quality."}
{"text":"Really good burger for average burger price.  This was a quality burger that wasn't dripping in grease.  I ordered one with fried onions and they let me add pulled pork as a topper for a little more, very good.  I also ordered the loaded bonfire fries as an appetizer, they were awesome, but made to share so I couldn't finish them.  The service was great and paired with the good food for sure worth stopping in."}
{"text":"I came here after hearing so many rave reviews from my \"foodie\" friends.  I have to say, I was a little disappointed.    I got the tourist burger which had a avocado spread as well as a roasted red pepper sauce, which both were extremely bland.  I did really enjoy the chips though!  And they serve it with a buffalo blue cheese sauce that is great!  The burger was cooked exactly how I wanted it!  The atmosphere is pretty cool.  I think that the place just didn't live up to all the hype but I would be willing to try it again."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place out based on the yelp reviews and was pretty disappointed. Ordered the mocha shake and it came out looking like a vanilla shake; I asked to make sure it wasn't the waitress mistaking my order, she confirmed it was the mocha. It had no coffee flavoring whatsoever.   I then ordered the 7th heaven burger with cheese. It was better than a fast food burger but not much more than that. I would rate the burger 3 stars.   The skinny fries that came with the burger were awful. They were absolutely drenched in salt.   I wouldn't recommend this place."}
{"text":"I'm not one for hyperbole (this is actually a lie), but: BEST BURGER EVER!!  Seriously, though - I can't remember having a tastier burger, ever. I got the Rail with cheese, loaded. It looked like a cartoon dagwood sandwich, with all the veggies. I loved it!  My friend and I shared a wedge salad before our burgers came out. It was delicious, and could probably be split 4 ways and still be an ample serving.   Our server was Diane, and she was phenomenal!! She was so friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. She seemed genuinely happy to be there, and it was infectious. What an awesome, classy lady!"}
{"text":"Awesome fried pickles; always crunchy with spices and herbs in the batter.  Burgers are good, but order the blt sliders.  They're not technically on the menu anymore but they'll still make them. Embrace your inner fat kid and get a double order."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to The Rail at Great Northern.  I have been to the one at Summit Mall and thought my husband had to give this restaurant a try!  We were greeted promptly, sat right away, and met our server, Alexis.  In a word, she was very attentive!  After starting us with milkshakes, my husband had the burger wrap and I had the chicken club.  You should have seen the slice of mozzarella they added to his wrap!  The burger itself could not have been any better.  It was cooked perfectly to order! My husband was much impressed!  My chicken club was juicy and delicious.  We shared sweet potato fries.  The manager stop by to see how we were doing.  We had a nice chat. Without a doubt, we are looking forward to our next visit!"}
{"text":"One of the best burgers I've had in a long time. Cooked to perfection! Great service too!"}
{"text":"This was my second and final trip to the Rail. The food itself is lack -luster. I enjoy the tomato jam and the beef is good, but the portions are chincy.   My chips came without dip and the burger had just a small sprinkling of cheese. These things could have been remedied, but our waitress didn't come back to check on us until the chips were cold, my burger was half gone, and my fiancees drink was empty.  She did take the cheese and chips off the bill. She was polite.  The prices are too high, service too poor, portions too small, food too mediocre. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Had the \"local yokel\" burger & fries. So so good! Cooked perfectly & the egg is just the right addition to kick it up.  I couldn't  finish the whole thing!  Fries are lightly seasoned, good.  The service was awesome!!  Not a very long wait on a Saturday night either.  They also have handmade shakes.  Yum!"}
{"text":"Great place for date night! Boyfriend and I sat in one of the bar booths and both bartenders were great and very attentive! They recommended the crouching burger and it was hands down one of the best burgers I've ever had! Not sure what the \"rail\" sauce is but it was delicious! I had a chocolate milkshake and he had vanilla both were great. And my pregnant sister asked me to bring her home a cherry pie milkshake (only seasonal special) and they were almost out but managed to get me one for her (:   Overall great experience and great food! Only thing is I wish they had a better selection of fries! I got onion rings but I preferred the skinny fries over them.    Give it a try for yourself you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"The rail is my go to for a consistently good burger. I like that they change their menu up every once in the while with new burger specials. I decided to try something new last time we visited and got the BLT on happy hour special. It was only 4.50 and so good I would have paid more than that for it. They are very generous with the bacon and it was simple and well executed. The bread was buttered and that gave the sandwich an extra level of nostalgia to when my gma made it the same way when I was little. The rail also has a pretty good variety of beer on tap and its great if your looking for something different to try. The fried pickles are also a must while you're here. They add dill to the batter and it makes it even better. If your out at the mall shopping or out to a movie make sure you make a stop here first."}
{"text":"There were meat hooks hanging above the bar. I don't appreciate that because it makes me think about the slaughter of the cow. I am very much in the line of thinking with Native Americans regarding dead animals. I want to absorb the essence and strength of the beast and honor their sacrifice that is allowing me to continue living. I try to lift weights on days I eat meat. The paradox is that cows don't eat meat yet they seem strong. Also reminds me of Foot Fist Way, when Chuck the Truck is discussing his workouts and how he doesn't feel the need to lift weights. He said that tigers are strong, and they don't lift weights. These are all universal truths.  The burgers are excellent. The people in the kitchen do a wonderful job of cooking the burgers to temperature. I recommend both the avocado spread burger and the one with bacon and egg. The Rail is cooking up some of the best burgers in the Cleveland area."}
{"text":"Move over B-Spot, The Rail gives me all of the quirky customization options plus a more delicious bun and patty! The menu here is pretty big and full of daily/monthly specials. Everything is sold separately, but even with ordering an appetizer, side, and two burgers, the price was right.   I ordered the bootlegger burger, complete with fried onions, BBQ sauce, and cheddar cheese. The burger itself was fabulous: tender with the right amount of seasoning. The bun was even more delicious and so buttery. My SO ordered the crouching burger with the pork shoulder and wontons; it was the perfect mix of soft/crunchy and meaty. I can't put in any comment on the milkshakes or cocktails, but we were drooling over the milkshakes at the table over.  The service here goes above and beyond, as well. Our server must have had ten tables or more at once, and we still received perfect service. The staff is knowledgeable, makes good recommendations, and prompt with delivery/clean-up. This is now my top place for burgers; I'll be back."}
{"text":"Wanted it to be great. Failed to be more than good. I would not come back.  Burgers were very fresh and tasty. Quality was excellent.  The failures were in the service and the drinks. Ordered 2 drinks and a beer. \"Drinks\" were mostly ice and very little (if any) booze. Highly disappointed. Moscoe mules are not difficult. If I wanted a glass of ice I would have ordered it. Instead I paid 6.50 for it.  Service was slow and non attentive. Seemed bothered to be helping us. Made an offer if we wanted another drink after we were finished and waiting for the check. Should have offered 45 minutes before that. It was poor enough that not only will I not be back but I won't hesitate to tell others not to go.  Head for the B Spot. Equally good food but they seem like they actually want you to enjoy being there. Imagine that."}
{"text":"We had dinner at The Rail at 7:30pm.  It's now 10:50pm and I'm still thinking about the burger I ate and how good it was.  When was the last time you ate a burger and were thinking about it 3 hours later??  THAT GOOD!  I had The Rail burger with lettuce, tomato,mayo. I added blue cheese and the sweet onion jam for a play on sweet and salty.  Great idea in my opinion!  Try it!  Service was great (thanks JJ)!  We are already planning our next visit."}
{"text":"Great music, great burgers.  Had The Rail with Cheese and bacon.  Definitely good choice."}
{"text":"Went here for a second time and left liking it even more than the first. I had the BBQ burger and it was cooked to perfection and had great flavor. I opted for the sweet potato fries this time and that was a smart decision (self five!) I also was given a free beer so bonus points for that. The new addition to my excursion this time was a shake. I elected to go with the peanut butter brownie shake and OMG. It was amazing! Highly recommend having it. If I wasn't moving I would order it every time I went after having it. This is a great place. It has a cool atmosphere and everything is local from Ohio and great tasting."}
{"text":"Very good burger , the beef is juicy and seasoned just right . I had the Local Yokal , a 1/2 lb burger with swiss cheese , thick cut bacon and a fried egg .....yummy ! The burgers do not come with fries so plan on adding a few bucks on for some unless you don't eat fries but that just seems so un American . If you decide to go the all American route , split an order as it is a plentiful amount . I have to add, the bun was unimpressive but its all about the beef anyway ...nobody gives a s*** about the bun !"}
{"text":"Very good burgers, very poor service. I've been here several times and this has been true every time. Doesn't matter what time of day it is, or where you sit, the service is always ice cold and the burgers are always delicious.  I know a lot of people can look past service issues, but I'm not one of them. It measurably decreases my enjoyment of going out, and it's just not worth it. Since you can get great burgers and great service at other places in the vacinity."}
{"text":"We've just eaten the best restaurant burgers EVER.    Cue the chorus.....       HAAAL-lelujah !       ...hallelujah hallelujah.......   HAAL-leEHH..lu..JAH !     Apologies to Haydn---but it seemed perfectly appropriate. Those great burgers from years long past had been resurrected.  Only NOW---at The Rail---theirs were even BETTER than ones I remember.  This is a fabulous spot of which we plan to be regulars.                              * * * EVERYTHING * * *       FIVE BRIGHT SHINING 24 karat GOLD STARS   FOOD..... THE RAIL BURGER ~ (medium) with American      cheese, lettuce, tomato, pickle spear, raw onion,      on toasted bun; generous size, juicy (yes!) and      packed with wonderful beef (steak-like) flavor. SKINNY FRIES ~ great, but didn't eat many; the     burger was SO good, I ate only a few;  major     epiphany:  The Rail made me realize that for years     I'd been eating fries out of HABIT---only to accom-     pany mediocre (sometimes $$) restaurant burgers.   HOUSEMADE CHIPS ~ (kettle-style) ...fantastic      crunchy hard-to-resist; served with a phenomenal     dipping sauce (mayo, red pepper, and chunky bits      of blue cheese) ONION RINGS ~ lightly battered crispy goodness!---     NOT that yucky breaded version that seems to be      the new standard  STAFF..... BRITTANY ~ our knowledgable, friendly, super-     attentive, ever-so-likeable server RICK ~ General Manager---but nothing general      about him;  Distinctive Manager or maybe Excep-     tional Manager would be more appropriate titles. (If I had a restaurant I'd do whatever I could to  snatch these two away.)       INTERIOR..... Cool, casual, comfortable...very private booths, too.  LOCATION..... GREAT NORTHERN MALL ~ Convenient and easy to get to.  Once you've been here, you'll never forget how  to get here again...and again.  Near the rear entrance  of Sears.  But driving by along that outer winding mall  road---with acres of lot between---you'd miss it.  Unless someone keeps up on current restaurant-related events,  they'd never know it existed---couldn't even FIND this  genuine FIND by accident.  Spread the word---this place  deserves to thrive.  It's THAT good.   PARKING..... It's a MALL!  It's FREE !   And the wide open range of  countless spaces means you can park that pristine new  Lamborghini Veneno safely away from others.  Another  plus:  no mace-in-hand dark side streets, scary back  alleys, or creepy multi-leveled cavernous echoing  garages.     ~ ~ ~  ~ ~ ~   From the moment we walked in, to the moment we walked out, our entire experience was perfect.   PERFECT.    I'll admit that I'm pretty particular---but I'm also fair and reasonable.  If something isn't quite right, I never make an overblown deal about it.  That's immature and petty---but understandable for toddlers using booster seats.  (Amazing, though, how many adults still sit in them.)  And instead of mentioning in a review that my water glass wasn't refilled (horrors!) or my soup wasn't warm (ULGH--- I've been poisoned!) or a server didn't wear a constant smile (RUINED it---2 stars for sure!) or I didn't get enough dressing (ALCH---CALL EMS!) believe it or not---I'll actually VERBALIZE my issue to an employee.  Stupefying solution---isn't it?  I've rarely had to do this---never had to here at The Rail---but it DOES work.  Using common sense means any issues are quickly resolved and one never has to retaliate by writing unfair untrue or nasty low star reviews.  The mean-spirited cynics that DO, are most often releasing pent-up frustrations and aggressions having nothing at all to do with anything OUTSIDE their worlds, but rather with everything INSIDE their own microscopic hateful negative ones.       For the last two decades or so, I've seen beef quality from grocers go from tasty to nasty.  A number of factors contribute to this:  less nutritional cattle diet, hormonal additives, less pasturing, infrequent exercise, heavy public beef demand, younger palates accepting it (never tasted higher grade---but low cost---of recent past), probably hundreds of new food spots opening weekly throughout the country, better-quality meats once available to the general public are now reserved for the $$$ restaurants and this $$ one, the advent of food networks and nearly 24/7 cooking instructional/competitive programming that continues stirring up this crazed interest in foods---buying it, preparing it, and eating it.      ~~~~ Thanks to The Rail---who source their beef locally---we can enjoy a full-of-flavor burger just like the good old days nearly 30 years ago.  A little more cost-wise than Five Guys, Buckeye Beer Engine, and Brown Bag, but there's NO comparison in quality.  None.  The Rail is worth every extra dollar---by FAR.   And for an easy (heehee) way to find this spot, just remember:                            NEAR SEAR'S REAR  Update...  4-5 visits since...same burgers...all 5 star encores!"}
{"text":"Meh, I hate writing wishy washy reviews but that's kind of how I felt about The Rail. My husband and I visited The Rail on a Sunday afternoon about 4:45 or so. We walked in and were greeted promptly and sat right away. The restaurant had a fun atmosphere and I really had high expectations based on the other reviews.   Our server greeted us (guy with the handlebar mustache, idk his name) and took our order. To be honest I didn't really care for him. He wasn't really rude, but he just wasn't that nice. He was very flat and just took our orders with an \"Okay.\" He seemed a little friendlier with some tables, but not all. He just wasn't very personable and I felt kind of awkward each time he came over.   We ordered the fried pickles to start, and they were really delicious. Really well seasoned and served with a jalapeño ranch. I'm a big fried pickle fan and these were really great. For our entrees we both ordered the Local Yokel, and then an order of fries to split. I unfortunately wasn't that impressed with the burger. I really wanted to love it but it fell a little flat. The burger meat itself was really fresh and had fantastic grill marks. It was definitely great quality but did not taste seasoned or salted. (I actually put salt on my burger to try to help.) The bacon on the burger was also really great. But the fried egg was overdone, so the yolk that is suppose to really give it some sauce was very minimal. So unfortunately because of the dry egg and lack of salt in the burger, I don't know, it just didn't do it for me. My husband really enjoyed his and ate it really quickly. He also had a much softer egg. I know it seems picky but the egg can really make or break a burger, especially when there's no mayo, ketchup, etc. The cheese on it was swiss, so again, not salty. I am ashamed to say it because I think the meat quality here was excellent, but I'd pick the Royal burger at Red Robin over this. The fries were great though. They were really similar to McDonald's fries but way better. They were really tasty and flavorful. I don't know how they did it because there was no visual seasoning on the fries. But they were really good!   All in all, I would probably go to the Rail again, but it wouldn't be my first choice. Also, I'd order something totally different. They do have great appetizers, an impressive beer selection, and nice happy hour specials, so I think it could be a great happy hour choice. It's not a bad place at all, but it just wasn't as good as I thought it would be. I honestly would have given it a 4 star rating if our server had been really friendly."}
{"text":"Burgers! Yum!  The location is kind of tucked away, but it's right by the mall, so if there is a long wait, at least there's someplace to walk around while you wait.  The obvious comparison here is B-Spot. This place gets local ingredients and is Ohio themed, which I love.   The food: Greenwich Pig Burger - contrary to popular belief there is actually no pork on this burger. I had this burger- medium rare (but was probably cooked more to medium). I got the rail mayo on the side - thank goodness! This burger was SO greasy it was making the bun fall apart. I can't imagine if I would have had the mayo on there too! Although it was so greasy/oily, the flavors were spot on. Bleu cheese- love it.  And the mayo was actually delicious and garlicky. Burger had a nicely seasoned flavor.  The Bootlegger - husband had this, loved the onion straws. He ordered his medium-well, and it came more like well (no pink in the middle). His burger was better than mine, I think.   Truffle fries - $6.75 is pretty steep for french fries, but we thought it might be worth a try.  They are obviously the Rail equivalent of the \"Lola Fries.\" They were' shoestring fries (or \"skinny fries\"). Great texture. They had a nice flavor with the truffle oil and parmesan, but as far as the price, I think next time I'll try the other types they have - the sweet potato fries looked good as they sailed past me on the way to another table.   I also had a bourbon from Watershed Distillery on the rocks - but the rocks were tiny pieces of soda ice - strange.  Service was pretty good, a bit slow for drinks to come out, but food was blazing fast after we put our order in.   If I graded this based on my husbands burger, I would give it a 4, but based on my burger, have to go with 3. I will definitely be back to try the sweet potato fries and possibly the Tourist burger - which was my second choice on the menu. Hopefully on the next visit, I can upgrade to 4 or even 5 stars. I think there is definitely potential here!"}
{"text":"What a wonderful addition to Great Northern!! Ended up here yesterday with a friend and her 11 month old for lunch before heading inside the mall to shop and we had a great experience! I love the atmosphere- slightly upscale burger joint, but casual enough to swing by for a burger pre-shopping spree. We walked in around lunch time so they were pretty packed, as can be expected. But, we were seated right away upstairs. The host and hostess in the front were very friendly, talkative and accommodating.   The friendliness didn't end downstairs with the hosts. Our server was great! He was VERY friendly and attentive. Came by a few times before us ordering our food - to get drink orders, explain the menu/specials, and to take our orders - and then again multiple times after we got our food - to ensure we had everything we needed, make sure we were enjoying everything just fine, and for drink refills. Like I mentioned, they were pretty busy since it was lunchtime so I was impressed with the amount of attention he still gave us.   Like most people have said in their reviews, I like the concept of this place - locally raised beef, local beers (decent beer selection!), etc. They have monthly appetizer and burger specials. I REALLY wanted to try the fried pretzel bites and fried pickles, but figured one fried thing during my meal was enough and I wasn't letting go of getting fries with my meal ;) - Anyways, I ordered the naked burger (no bun) with a veggie burger - added grilled onions and shrooms and some pepperjack cheese. The veggie burger was super flavorful and the toppings added to the flavor! The meals don't come with fries so you need to order your side separately, and I got the skinny fries (they have truffle fries too!) and they were great. My friend got a burger and she loved it - thick and juicy..   Side note - I must say for all the vegetarians/non beef eaters out there - you WILL find food here. And the only options are not the salad or pita sandwich like a review before me said. You can make any burger with a veggie patty or create your own with a veggie burger patty. Multiple apps are veggie friendly. And, if you eat meat, just not beef- they have a chicken option instead of using a beef patty.  Overall, I think I'll definitely be back when I'm  around Great Northern. Service, food, and atmosphere were wonderful and all in all, wasn't expensive at all - Veggie burger, regular burger, 2 orders of fries, kids meal grilled cheese+fries, and 2 drinks = 27 dollars ... not bad at all.  PS I was looking for it on the opposite side of Sears - by Wild Mango, but it's by the theater, only accessible from the outside. So, if you see the entrance to the mall by the theater and the new Asian restaurant, you'll see Rail right next to both of those :)"}
