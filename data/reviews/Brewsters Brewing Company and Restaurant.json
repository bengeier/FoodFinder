{"text":"Not a great experience.   There were 4 of us and all of our meals were mediocre at best.  We hadn't been here in a while so something must have changed as it used to be good.  We won't be back."}
{"text":"Great beers, love the changing selection. Food seems to be ok and consistent. Wing night wings are pretty bad"}
{"text":"We were a hungry group of 4, apres-golf. Nice to be on the outside patio, away from the noise.   All enjoyed their food, burgers announced as excellent, good meaty dry ribs, and fresh chunky fish in the fish & chips. The service was friendly and good. Overall a firm step up from many pubs of equal pricing."}
{"text":"Met friends for a quick bit before going to the movies. They remodelled the inside and it looks way better! The beer was yummy and loved the wide selection. Pretzel app was delicious. Also had the crab cake salad and will def be back to eat it again! Service was slow but in all fairness they were busy."}
{"text":"Awesome beer selection (real craft brew beers), food was actually really good as well for a pub.   Love it."}
{"text":"Consistently good pub food!  Delicious craft beers!  Families can also bring children as they have a dining room side as well!  One of our local \"go-to's\""}
{"text":"Arrived and was sat at a table but my friends had not yet arrived. Waited 20 minutes with not even eye contact from the server. Even after my friends arrived we might as well have been invisible. Should I order take out over the phone for delivery to my table? Might take less time..."}
{"text":"This place was less than OKAY. My first time I went for lunch and had the braised beef poutine which was good but very heavy and rich and I felt a bit sick by the time I was done. It had perfectly tender beef and lots of cheese. There were capers in it as well which I usually dislike but paired well with the dish although it did make it overly salty. The second time I had the chicken pecan salad ( $17) it was horrible and bitter tasting, Ive had WAY BETTER at Wendy's for half the price. I had the same server both times and she was fairly prompt however she almost seemed annoyed to have to take our order. It was a bit too dark for my liking for a lunch, but there were limited options given the location. Too pricey for what it is. Wont be back."}
{"text":"I have a soft spot for this Brewsters location. Perhaps this stems from all the time and money my 18 year old self spent here, but I still always have a good time when I come to Brewsters.  For a pub, their menu has a surprising number of vegetarian options. All of their burgers can be made with a meat-free patty which is fantastic. I'm also a sucker for their cheesecake. It's great when you aren't looking for a meal but you want to grab something to eat anyways.  For those who have never been to a Brewster's, they brew all of their own beers so don't expect to get any industry standards. Of course my dad allllways has to complain about how he \"can't get a real beer\" here but honestly he's just being stubborn. Their beers are just as good as the commercial stuff. I recommend the Hammerhead if you enjoy a red ale.  Overall, Brewsters is great if you're looking for a neighbourhood pub to grab a round of drinks with friends."}
{"text":"It took me way too long to finally try Brewsters. Going in fairly unaware, I can honestly say I'm a big fan of Brewsters.   It is a pretty spacious place with a lot of seating (different types too- booths, bar seating, comfy lounge chairs etc.). It is certainly a bar, but with more style than you would normally find.   The reason to go to Brewsters and the reason to stay is the food. The beer is all made on-site and the recipes really live up to their descriptions. The Czech Pilsner styled beer tasted great, and the Blueberry beer they offer is nothing short of delicious (complete with real blueberries dropped into the glass). The food lives upto to the beer and the menu suggests pairings. I had a bison burger with green chili's and Havarti cheese. Very hot and very tasty. The food isn't cheap, but it is well worth the money.  I can't comment on the night life at Brewsters, but I am already hankering to go back and try it out on different days and get the whole Brewsters experience."}
{"text":"Quick props, bulletin style:  *Ate here on a Sunday, was a packed house with not one table available.  Service was slow, but we understood.  *Servers and managers were extremely friendly and apologetic for the slow service.  *After waiting a longer-than-usual amount of time for our meals, they brought me a hamburger instead of the pizza I ordered.  Server told me it would be another 20 minutes for pizza, you could tell she felt horrible.  *Apologized profusely, gave me the hamburger for free, an XL plate of fries with gravy for free, a pretzel I had ordered earlier for free, and if that wasn't enough...  All of our drinks at our table of five were taken off the bill.  ABOVE AND BEYOND BREWSTERS LAKE BONAVISTA, THANK YOU!  Love Hayden"}
{"text":"Great for a brew pub. Consistently good food. Great place to bring kids although on Friday nights you need to come early."}
{"text":"Hit and miss for food. Really nice staff. Beer is good!"}
{"text":"Brewsters is really hit and miss for me. As a vegetarian, there was very little on the menu that I could eat. Now that I'm a pescetarian, there are certainly more options (like the fish tacos, which I actually do enjoy) on the menu for me.   When I can eat the food, I typically find it to be tasty, well cooked, and just generally good. When I can't, I find it a disappointment... go figure.   But along with my ability to eat (or not eat) the food, Brewsters is really inconsistent in terms of its service. Sometimes the servers are outstanding and really do deserve a gold medal (or a gold star at the very least), but other times... well they're not so good. In fact, this one time I had a friend have to walk to the bar to refill her own drink because the wait-staff wasn't coming around to our table. This might've been excusable if it was a hopping, crowded night, but at the time we were one of four tables filled. Really, it shouldn't have happened. This is only oen of several stories I have about the service at this particular Brewsters location.  The truth is I will keep coming back to Brewsters, despite the inconsistency in service. This is mostly because my friends like coming."}
{"text":"Went to Brewsters last night for the first time after their Reno.  They did a nice job with the Reno opening things up and adding some cool touches like brick columns.  My issue was the prices, I guess to pay for the reno they have raised their prices substantially.  Was shocked when our bill for the two of us came and it was $100.  Two drinks each, gyoza appetizer to share and a meal each didn't seem like it should be that much.  I enjoyed my mango chicken quesadilla, but my husbands bison burger was nothing special, probably won't order that again."}
{"text":"We sat out on the patio of this restaurant which is part of the strip mall in Lake Bonavista. With the sun out it was quite toasty. They have umbrellas at every table which is very nice. The patio is just a view of the parking lot (no lake views).   The service was very good. There happened to be a wedding party of 50 or more that came in around the same time as us, and we were kept informed that when ordering food it may take a bit longer. It actually wasn't that bad of a wait, so kudos for that.   Prices are the usually $16-$20 bucks for almost any choice on the menu. Typical pub fare. It was well prepared and tasted pretty good.   They have different drink special for each day of the week. Wing Tuesdays for .45 per wing and it drops to .25 after 9pm.   The inside it quite large and well suited for large groups.  The lake is just a walk to the end of the parking lot.   Overall it feels like a community pub away from the hustle you would experience when say hitting up a pub on 17th ave."}
{"text":"Brewsters is now our go-to favourite local for a good meal!  We've been here quite a few times now, and every time the food has been amazing, especially the burgers. The service has always been quick and friendly, and I've never been disappointed.  The only complaint I have is that,on hockey nights, the lounge side is full of loud sports fans while the restaurant side is full of screeching toddlers. Not the most relaxing of experiences, but not something that can be helped either.  I highly, highly recommend Brewsters for good food in a good environment!"}
{"text":"Decided to pop in to the lounge for drinks and dinner. Sat down at one of a few empty tables (hint: it wasn't busy) and waited... and waited and waited. Two waitresses walked by us, one of them 3 times, and just ignored us. Several waitress passed right by our table delivering food to other tables and no one asked us if we'd been helped. No menus, no drinks - nothing.  After waiting well over 10 minutes we got up and left.   They've lost our business and I'll be sure to share our experience."}
{"text":"Beer and wings, what more could you ask for?!  LOOOOVE their wings.... especially the hot honey garlic.... At first you may think that it's spacious but really it's not too large of an area (which is nice), but on a busy day fills up very quickly!  It's separated nicely, has restaurant side, lounge side, and a small patio area.  What more could you ask for in a 'neighbourhood' pub?"}
{"text":"Stopped here for drinks after a fun day at Lake Bonavista.  Service was ok, we weren't offered water, we had to ask for for some. We also ordered pizza, but were not given side plates, and again had to ask. Other than that, server checked on us regularly and was friendly.  Our Brewsters Special pizza was ok, not the greatest and not the worst. This place is conveniently located right across from the lake if you want to grab some drinks with your friends.  Room for improvement: again, being attentive and offering water right off the bat and making sure little things like plates are given when food comes out will increase rating."}
{"text":"I have been going for wings at Bonavista Brewsters for over 8 years on wing night which is Tuesdays. The wings have gone really downhill. They are the skinniest wings I have ever seen in a restaurant, and out of the ten wing order, only two are the drummets. Every second visit, we wait up to an hour for the order to come out of the kitchen. Frustrated with the service and the expensive wings (they are now charging .35 per skinny wing instead of .25, I denied a server a tip. She came back to me, in front of my friends, with the credit card machine, and asked \"Did you really mean that?\" When I complain to the server or send the wings back, because they have been sitting under the warming lights too long or are too skinny, the staff will begrudgingly add a few more to the plate but with the lecture, \"that the kitchen is busy and they can't control portion size.\" Meanwhile, the person at the next table has noticeably bigger wings than the ones on your plate! The beer is good but the wings are consistently bad, even when it's not wing night and management can't seem to do anything about it. Don't waste your time or money here. I have photos but not sure how to post them on here"}
{"text":"Yesterday I was at this restaurant for a birthday party. I ordered the lemon quinoa salad with added chicken. Firstly, there wasn't any quinoa or kale in my salad at all which I made it a hugely overpriced bowl of mixed mesclun.   Secondly whoever is making their foods should educate themselves on safe food practices and hygiene as the salad and/or employee obviously was not washed properly, I ended up with a rather horrific case of food poisoning.... I'd like to say that I'm not still suffering but that would be a total lie.   I'm sure there's nothing they can do to help my experience now, but I strongly encourage management to take real steps towards making sure other Brewsters patrons don't have my experience. I don't like paying $20 for a bowl of food poisoning in disguise, and I'm sure that others won't either. Unfortunately this experience will most likely be my last at this restaurant.   If they think that a fancy renovation is going to make up for overpriced food and poisoning their customers, then perhaps new management and staff are needed as well."}
