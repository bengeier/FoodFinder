{"text":"Mind blowing!! Love this hidden treasure of a restaurant. Although only vegetarian, they do a FANTASTIC JOB at their menu items. Customer experience was above average. Food came out fast and the people working were really friendly. Will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"My friends Dave and Boh took me out for supper at Shahi Masala Paan on Friday, August 11, 2017 and it was delicious.  Thank you to Shahi Masala Paan for friendly and accommodating service and great food and, of course, thank you to Dave and Boh for treating me.  Shahi Masala Paan offers mostly Indian food, mostly from southern India, I think.  There is a wide and varied menu and you will need to return many times to check it all out.  I cannot even tell you what we had because Dave and Boh did the ordering and I am not very familiar with Indian food or the names of it.  It was all excellent however.  I know that I did have one of three Indian-flavoured lemonades though, and it was good too.  Please see the Facebook page for Shahi Masal Paan.  Thank you.  https://www.facebook.com/Shahi-Masala-Paan-1345447112237666/"}
{"text":"I've been here twice now, and the food is pretty darn good. I had the tastiest veggie sandwich here that I think I've ever had (try the Bombay grilled sandwich - trust me).

This restaurant is 100% vegetarian, so coming from a veggie family, it sure makes things easy.

So why the loss of stars you ask? One of the times I went, they said they didn't have any of the items under a certain category of their menu. Um... what?! But it's on your menu. If you're going to tease my taste buds like that, then you know I'm not gonna be happy about it.

I'll still be back though, but the next time I go I will be sure to not go in hopes of appeasing a particular craving... you know, juuuust in case they don't have it that day."}
