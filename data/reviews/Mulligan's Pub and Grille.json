{"text":"Went during wing night and it was not incredibly busy. Wings were very good as was the music (touchtunes).  The service was very bad. The servers (we had a total of 4) seemed to be confusing orders and mixing up the flavor of wings we got. One of the members of our party got a vodka red bull and the waitress didn't even open the redbull and pour it in. She simply dropped off both for the drinker to mix himself. Overall bad experience but the food saved it. Will not be going back."}
{"text":"Whether we eat there or order food to take out, we always enjoy our Mulligans experience. We have gotten the pizza, wings, various sandwiches, fish and chips  (even better when dining in), salads... All delicious! We have young children, and find this place to be friendly for them (especially at the hours we go :) ). I recommend this place to all!"}
{"text":"I've loved this place since I was a little girl. Their wings are awesome, I find myself really disappointed every time I try to have wings somewhere else."}
{"text":"As good a pub grub as you are going to find in the Lyndhurst, Highland Heights, Mayfield area. The food here is always well above average and doesn't have that processed feel and taste you'll find in chains. The chicken fingers seem to be hand cut as do the fries. Service has been an issue with others. I've not had that problem. The atmosphere is relaxed, the drinks are cold, the food is good. It's what you hope the bar in your neighborhood will be."}
{"text":"We love that there are so many awesome choices on the menu & on tap. We have wonderful service every time we come in and regularly get take out for our office! The food, staff, and ambiance make Mulligan's one of our favorite places."}
{"text":"Not too happy about this place tonight. Usually the service is good but tonight they were exceptionally busy. Reserved tables were everywhere empty or with one or two people. Nowhere to sit down so me and my teenage son sit down at the bar and wait. Fifteen minutes later a barmaid comes up and says we can't sit here. Not even nice about it, sorry your day sucks too, you are in the service industry and if you want to continue being busy you better treat your customers better. Even the future ones"}
{"text":"This place is a NIGHTMARE. Let me preface this review by saying I grew up (and still live right around the corner) from Mulligan's. I've worked in the restaurant business for half my life as a cook, waiter, manager, host... you name it, I did it.  Last night was the most uncomfortable and disrespected I've ever been at a business.
After dinner and a show to celebrate my girlfriend's birthday, our group decided to stop at Mulligan's for one drink before we all went our separate ways. It's 11:30 at night, and from the moment you walked in, the smell of a mop bucket was over powering. Not my favorite smell while eating or drinking, but I get it, the place has got to be cleaned up towards the end of the night. It soon became apparent why the place smelled like you had just been through the mop bucket's wringer. The staff here had 2 unattended mop buckets just sitting in the dining room. After my girlfriend's mom said that the smell was really starting to bother her, I asked the staff if there's anyway they could just get these smelly things away from us since nobody is using them. This was the beginning of the insanity.
The staff took great offense to this request. It's not like we were asking them to stop cleaning, or to work later. We just wanted them to pull the unused mop bucket out of the dining room (3ft away from us), so that the smell was not so overwhelming. We were ignored. The next thing I know, the kitchen door is whipped open and the cook pushes it CLOSER to us, and uses it to prop open the kitchen door. The door holds open by itself, you don't even need a door stop. So this employee was clearly trying to make some point to us by slamming doors and shoving the issue we were having right in our faces. I asked him again, \"Is there anyway we can get this thing away from the table?\". Ignored. 
Now it's time to get the manager, and get this resolved. We flag her down, and we explain what is going on. While I'm talking to her, the cook bursts out from the kitchen again and says \"This guy (me) doesn't like the smell in here. Why don't you get the F*** out?!\". My jaw dropped. A gasp let out from the other guests at our table. This became a circus in an instant. 
Our party's age ranged from 30-70, there were 8 of us or so. We weren't being rude or unreasonable by any means. We all look at the manager, Melinda, to see what is going to happen next. Clearly, this is not normal or safe behavior by anybody. Melinda proceeds to explain that it was us that was out of line! I've never been so blown away. I felt like I was in some bizarre trashy nightmare.
This isn't the only bar that Jay Wright owns around here. I've actually waited on him, and his wife a few times, they are nice people. With that being said, the staff at this bar does not reflect the values of our community. Bullying and intimidation have no place in the hospitality business, or in our neighborhood. Please do us all a favor Mr. Wright, let your staff know that it's not appropriate to treat people so disrespectfully. This was the last time I will ever step foot in Mulligan's. 
WHAT A NIGHTMARE."}
{"text":"food only warm  service slow wait staff work with heads down and scowl.NO DISCOVER CARD!!!"}
{"text":"I come here about once every week or two for lunch. Tons of parking, seating, tvs and a great menu. I have never had bad thing yet. I highly recommend the buffalo chicken, either wrap or salad, or the leprechaun burger. I prefer the house chips to the fries, and grilled chicken over crispy chicken. I will say it is a bit pricey but the portions are generous and the food is consistently delicious."}
{"text":"Always a great spot to bring friends. Particularly on 10 cent wing night (though no carry-outs or doggy bags) where you get some of the best wings in Cleveland super cheap. They may not have as many sauces as Winking Lizard, but the wings themselves are actually substantial and not little nubbins.

Good burgers, good service, good bar, and good prices overall. Its one of those places that you go back to often, and never really have a bad experience. Probably one of the most consistent places I eat at."}
{"text":"popped in for a nightcap.  Nothing special about the place.  Bar service was friendly.  Older crowd."}
{"text":"Cuban sandwich, Cajun wings, clam basket, YUM. Good bar food, regular drink/bar selection. Great place to stop in and have a snack and a drink. Trivia on Tuesdays. Love it."}
{"text":"This is our favorite spot for wings! Tuesday's and Thursday's are wing night so boneless wings are $.55 and traditional at $.65. It's a great sports bar to watch Cavs or Indians game. They can accommodate groups well. 
We always get Great service from Jen and Amy! Ask for them and they will take care of you. 
The drinks are good, whether you get a mixed drink or a beer, it will be worth it. The other food on the menu is also really good! There's nothing on the menu that we wouldn't get!"}
{"text":"Had dinner here last night. Service was absolutely amazing! It may have been a different person every time, but there was always someone at our table if we needed anything! Food was ok, seemed frozen/ pre-made. Good bar for a late night snack with great service and a good beer list."}
{"text":"I was not at all impressed with my experience at Mulligans. Aside from slow service and my server not being the friendliest, the food was pretty bad. To start, I ordered French onion soup which was more like beef bouillon with onions in it and melted cheese on top. The cheese was good, the soup was not. 

Next came my mulligan burger and chips with a side of their special French onion dip. The burger patty was so bland I actually had to pull it apart to salt and pepper it just to make it edible. Chips, how do you screw up chips? Easy, fry them in the same oil as fish so that the chips have a disgusting fish flavor to them. They tasted more like fish than chips, and even dipping them in the onion dip didn't help. I still don't know what is so special about the French onion dip, it didn't taste like much to me. 

I would have sent it all back had I not been on a travel schedule, but needless to say I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Second time into this place, second time with bad service and long wait for food. Food is nothing to rave about, most likely all frozen food.   \"All day specials\" are only during the Browns game, obviously (refer to picture). Will never recommend this place, and won't return."}
{"text":"Mulligans is overrated, with so-so food and an impatient wait staff. I don't know why locals hype it up so much, or waste their time here aside from the convenience of it's location. I've heard enough bad stories to scare me away from this place for good."}
{"text":"You can't beat wing night! My husband and I got out of there with a $17 tab including beer. Love this place!"}
{"text":"I had one of the top 10 burgers I've ever eaten there last week. The Smoky Ghost Burger is AMAZING!  I had to knife and fork it because it was so big. At $9.50 it's a STEAL! Next time I go out to Philips for training I know where I'm going for lunch. It's only about 2 miles from the plant in. 

On an interesting side note the Mayor and some of his legal staff were there for lunch as well meeting with a contractor. They were CHEAP tippers leaving only a $2 tip."}
{"text":"We live just a mile or 2 from Mulligan's and drive past it all the time, but never took the opportunity to stop. My husband and I were looking for a quick bite, close to home and decided to stop at Mulligan's.  I am glad that we did.  The restaurant was sufficiently crowded on a Saturday evening.  We seated ourselves and proceeded to review the menu.  Pleasantly surprised at the great prices for food and cocktails.  I ordered the strawberry mojito ($5) and buffalo chicken wrap, with homemade chips.  My husband ordered the corned beef wrap.  The mojito arrive a short time later, and it was just ok, nothing to write home about.  The buffalo chicken wrap was excellent.  Grilled chicken, spicy sauce, fresh lettuce and sandwich wrap, with a side of bleu cheese.  The chips were absolutely the stand out.  Thick cut, crisp, and tasty.  My husband enjoyed his wrap as well, he didn't realize that the corned beef would be cold, but other than that, he enjoyed the slaw and fries, also included in the wrap.  I ordered a batch of those homemade chips to-go, and I was surprised that when I arrived home and peeked into the carton, there was also a side of (homemade?) french onion dip, it was DELICIOUS.  I can't believe that we hadn't tried Mulligan's sooner.  We will absolutely return!"}
{"text":"Everything I eat here is good.  This is some of the best bar food in the Cleveland area.  I know everyone wants to claim to have the best wings in the area, but this is one of the places off the radar that actually might have them.  

Other than the wings, they always have good specials.  The burgers aren't those skinny crappy ones that a lot of other places serve.  Even the common stuff at other places is really good at Mulligan's like the nachos and quesadillas.

If I had to pick my absolute favorite thing on the menu, I would say the Buffalo Chicken Wrap with a side of potato salad.  The fries are those great fair fries that require (REQUIRE) vinegar, and if you aren't in the mood for those, the potato salad is really top notch and original.  I am pretty sure the magical ingredient here is bacon.

If I had one complaint about the place it is that the salads are just OK, but who wants to eat salads when the wings, wraps and pizzas are so good?"}
{"text":"Mulligans tavern is on of my all time favorite local bars. As the name implies it's a sports bar. It get's pretty busy on game days, but usually pretty casual and friendly. They have a nice selection of domestics as well as imports. This is a sports bar, not a cocktail bar however.

The food is really something I get at least once a week. The ruebens, turkey club, and burgers are all safe bets here. They also have real onion rings. In the summer they have outdoor seating which is always nice. I've personally been treated nicely by all the servers here. 

This place will always be on the top of my list for food, and an occasional beer. The atmosphere is fantastic. Be aware though, this is bar food- but bar food at it's best."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. The servers are very attentive and friendly. The house dressing at Mulligans is so good and I recommend the steak salad. The wings are awesome when you get them well done and extra wet. On Wednesday's they have an awesome pizza deal. The patty meltmis another favorite.

Typical neighborhood bar which also means the bathrooms are a little sketchy. They don't seem to get cleaned too often but that would be my only thing to knock on this place."}
{"text":"I am going to reiterate what I said from my last review. COLD beer-$1.75 Miller draft Sunday?. Noisy dishes being tossed under the bar. BUT, tonight (Sunday) we split the chicken caprese PLT.  Mulligans! Will you please, please keep this on your menu??? Make this a standard item, not just for spring!!!  We are going to try to tell everyone we can about this sandwich! You must try this."}
{"text":"Greatest grilled cheese in 10 mile radius!
Pickles and food is always fresh and delivered within a decent amount of time- clean atmosphere- and the beer is always cold! Great corner bar- beats Harry buffalo down the street in a flash!"}
{"text":"Only been here one time on a Sunday afternoon. They had cold miller drafts for $1.75. I was a little disappointed that they were out of the French dip so I ordered the three little pigs sandwich (bacon, ham, and pulled pork) which was great. 

Comfortable atmosphere and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Good beer selection, like Harps. Good skins, bad Pastrami fried patties. Great service. Nice local Tavern though I'm from CA."}
{"text":"So, let me just preface this review by saying apart from today I have never not tipped a waitress in my life. I know how undervalued wait staff are at any restaurant and am always aware of this when I tip. Today, was the only exception.

My fiancé and I came into Mulligan's just to grab a couple of drinks; today was his birthday. I've been here on several occasions, both with family and friends and have had a decent-ish time. Food and drinks are so-so and atmosphere is typically alright. 

Tonight from the moment we walked in our waitress seemed uninterested. The bar was basically empty apart from about five older men. We initially asked for waters before we checked out their drink menu only to be told (pretty rudely) that the kitchen is closed (we figured, it's 11 at night.) She then carded us, so I assume she thought we were underage and just looking to get some food. 

We didn't really care, we were not really looking to chat with our waitress and even though I was a little annoyed with her attitude that she at least brought our drinks.

When it was time to leave we paid for the bill and decided not to tip. Tips intended to indicate that you enjoyed your service, and in this case we were so uncomfortable that we didn't. We had initially planned on buying a couple more drinks but this sour waitress really made us feel unwelcome. We paid our $10.00 tab and went outside for a minute before we began to drive off. 

Now, for the big kicker. 

We had been outside maybe 30 seconds, we tried to hold the door open for the manager (I presume) who was holding a few patio chairs before we got our car. The waitress then opened the bar door and says rather loudly--she must not have assumed we were standing there: 

\"THOSE RAT ASS KIDS DIDN'T EVEN TIP!\" 

We stood in shock for a moment, expecting that the manager would call her out on it. She did not. How can you have so little respect for your customers? I shouted out to the manager saying \"We are those rat ass kids then, I guess?\" 

I misheard the waitress initially. I only know this because the manger corrected her. \"She said brat ass not rat ass.\" then sat down to smoke and chat on her cellphone like nothing had happened.

I never thought I'd feel relieved for not tipping someone. To be that rude over what would typically be about a $2.00 tip, can you imagine what they'd be like if we had actually been doing something wrong?

 This whole establishment needs an attitude change. We, along with our family and friends will definitely not be coming back. I'd suggest anyone on the fence about coming in to save your money and go to an establishment where they value customers."}
{"text":"Love this bar. Quiet little joint lots of tv's"}
{"text":"This is a tough review for me, because my experiences at Mulligan's are always so polarizing.  The food is really top notch as far as locally-owned pub-type establishments go.  Better than most of the alternatives.  But, the service always pisses me off.  Every time.

I have been to Mulligan's no fewer than thirty times, and probably closer to fifty.  I've worked within 3 miles of this joint for the better part of the past 7.5 years, and it's a default option for many colleagues, past and present.

And across all those visits, I'd say that less than 10% of the time I come out with an overall positive experience.  Sometimes, the service is painfully slow.  Sometimes, the servers are painfully abrupt and unfriendly.  Sometimes, it's an \"all of the above\" situation.

Last night, a group of us went out for a couple of beers after work, and this visit fit into the 90%.  I had to leave earlier than the others to pick my pup up from daycare, and our server got nasty with our whole group because we requested my check separately.  She lectured us that we didn't let her know when we got there.  How often does a group of 8 people who show up to a bar at 6pm on a work night get one check?  

My alternative option is Harry Buffalo down the street, and while I like the food at Mulligan's a lot better, the staff at Harry Buffalo is there to make the customers happy.  I was there on Wednesday, and the experience couldn't have been more different.  

I never choose Mulligan's when I have the choice.  I go when I'm invited by others, and it's not bad enough to keep me away.  The food is 3-4 stars and the service is 1.

Oddly, at the sister restaurant, The Wright Place, it's a 4-star experience all around.  The staff at Wright Place is awesome.  Same owners!  I just don't get it.

Oh, and yes... Mulligan's DOES have the best wings around.  If the possibility of bad service doesn't bother you, I could recommend this place to you and not feel bad."}
{"text":"Good place to stop for a bite to eat. Chicken wrap is yummy, Cobb is good, wings are great. Servers split  all tips so they all take care of every table which can be confusing but...
Definitely a place to come back to!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my experience here. There are a few interesting beers on their list including a pineapple beer and a chocolate beer. It's a place for sandwiches and burgers primarily, but they do have some Very Irish options that I don't see around too often including boxty. There are TVs all over the place set to a variety of sports, the bartenders are friendly but admittedly not the most attentive and this was noticed on both of my visits so far. I plan on coming back to try more the plates though, for the price it's a decent meal with some interesting options."}
{"text":"Fantastic food. Good prices. Very cozy atmosphere. A great neighborhood pub that will surely become a regular stop. The wings are out of this world!"}
{"text":"The thing I like about Mulligan's is that it's consistent.  Service is consistently good.  Food is consistently better.  And I consistently find myself at this watering hole all winter.  My favorite night of the week to hang out at Mulligan's is on Tuesdays, because they have bar trivia from 8-10 pm.  Anyone in the bar can play, and with a bit of dumb luck, you can win a certificate good for beer, food, or other goodies.  

This is my go to bar in the area.  It's definitely worth checking out if you're looking for some above average bar food and great drinks."}
{"text":"Food is just okay stuff I can make at home. Bartenders not very friendly or sanitary."}
{"text":"They seem like really nice people and it looks like it has a fun bar crowd, but our meal was just so-so. We may have ordered poorly, but the meals were not great. My husband liked his burger, but I ordered the Pub Melt and it was really bland. My daughter ordered chicken fingers and I tried them when I didn't like my Pub Melt and they were just average. The pretzel appetizer was good, but the cheese was kind of gross. It seemed like it had been sitting out for a while."}
{"text":"Service was very slow. The place was empty. They had a board written with specials stating \"During Game\" and \"All Day\" I ordered a cheese pizza. Which should have been one of the specials being a two topping pizza. They charged me three dollars extra. And said that it was not part of the specials. That the specials were only for during the game. When I pointed at the sign that said clearly my cheese pizza should have been a special, being a \"2topping pizza\". The waitress argued with me, and denied the $3 price difference. See my picture of the specials board for example....."}
{"text":"One of my go to places for meeting friends after work.  A nice neighborhood bar with a decent beer selection and diverse menu.  There are two pretty decent sized dining areas with plenty of seating and enough TVs to watch the games. The .50 wing nights on Tuesdays and Thursdays are super popular. I would have to say that they have best wings on this side of town.  The Cajun dry rub wings are my favorite item here.  I have also enjoyed the fish and chips and burgers.  The service is good and the bartenders attentive.  A solid pub for food and drink."}
{"text":"We go to Mulligan's frequently.  The food has always been good. I specially enjoy the pub burgers...sliders.  The drinks are great.  The best part is the service.  If you need anything you can ask any server and they will take care of you.  The atmosphere is friendly and located in our neighborhood.  We enjoy it!"}
{"text":"This place has an awesome chicken club sandwich. I get it almost every time, this isn't your deli meat kind of club.  My mom loves the wings and  they have a great beer list too.  A good local spot."}
{"text":"There are certain places that go unnoticed to some . Every time I have eaten here it has been a great meal. Great pub food ! The beer selection is amazing .Everything I love in a restaurant . Mulligans is tucked into a residential area and should be on everyone's radar for tasty food and beverages."}
{"text":"Mulligan's is a nice place to go during the week or even on the weekend.  It always seems  to be busy no matter the time of day, for good reason though.  The food is reasonably priced, tasty, and not limited to an Irish Pub themed menu.  My staples are wings and nachos but the burgers are worth a try too.  

The wait staff are very nice and on the ball.  This is the sister bar to The Wright Place so you know the owners are passionate about making your dining / drinking experience worth while. 

Bathrooms are nice, there are 2 bars, plenty of room, and all the usual suspects in bottle form behind the bar.  

My one bad experience isn't really that bad but its just one of those moments where you want to flick someone in the forehead.   I went to Mulligan's cause they advertised all these things on St. Patty's Day, DJ, Green Beer, Food Specials, etc.  That was all fine and dandy except that the DJ consisted of a boom box and a scratched CD that just would not play, kept skipping.  Then when I went to get a 'green beer', it was just food coloring and tap beer, OK......I'm fine with that too, but they put it in a white miller lite plastic cup.  Isn't the whole idea of having green beer is so that people around you can see that you are drinking it?  I had to call the manager over and explain how dumb it was for them to be doing this.  So he poured my cup into a pint glass and before you know it 3/4 of the bar patrons were holding green mugs of beer.   Yippee, I made a difference in a bunch of drunks lives!!"}
{"text":"They have good happy hour prices for drinks, but no food specials.   Their wings are pretty good, with specials on Tuesdays and Thursdays.   I only have two complaints about this place.   Meals are served with chips, upgradable to fries for two bucks.  Let's face it.... nobody likes eating chips for dinner.  Also, although attentive, the servers often appear impatient.  Other than that, I do frequent this place a few times a year and recommend."}
{"text":"The staff is completely disrespectful. They had a stinky mop bucket out at 11:30 pm on a Saturday night. We asked them to move it and they did nothing. The kitchen guy told us if we didn't like it that we can F'ing leave. This is out of line. Melinda (supposedly the manager) came over and condoned the kitchen guys actions. The blonde bartender also gave us attitude about the situation, and took pictures of us. This was our second time there and we will NEVER be back. The workers are completely disrespectful and give poor service if you're not a regular."}
{"text":"Service is slowwww.   And it's not even that busy.  Took 30 minutes for an order of wings. They weee good though. The servers don't seem to know how to hustle"}
{"text":"The food isn't bad and the atmosphere is nice but the service is always terrible. It takes forever for someone to take your order or even bring drinks and good luck getting a refill. This has been a problem for years at mulligans."}
{"text":"I would like to personally apologize to the staff of Mulligan's for my repeated escapades after partaking in the refreshments.  There is just something about this place that encourages excess drinking...or perhaps it's just the particular group of people who I hang out with here??

The food is above-grade, I was expecting typical bar food but the dishes I have tried have been pretty good.  (that might also be due to the excess refreshments)...But I think you would be safe trying some of their specialty dishes."}
