{"text":"I love this cute little place. Staff is so friendly, the cooks always greet you when you come in. It's like a small hometown diner. I also like that the kitchen is right out in the open. Service is quick and friendly. Typical diner food, with a lot of Greek options which are fantastic. The prices here are great, they don't over price the menus items. The chicken souvlaki pita is perfectly spiced and comes with onion and tomatoes. The 6.99 breakfast is great!"}
{"text":"Love Pete's! Go pretty much every weekend for breakfast. The early bird special can't be beat! And even if you aren't risen from the dead by 11am, it's still dang cheap to get a good breakfast (recommend the rye toast and eggs over-easy doused with Frank's). 

One guy on here says they charge for coffee refills, but that isn't true, and the drip is pretty good to boot. 

Perfect for locals looking for something quick and simple and good. I've never not had the breakfast but the lunch and dinner options - and the desserts! - all look real good too.

More than a greasy spoon, this place has a great energy and a team of super friendly servers who for regulars become like friends or even family. The guys behind the counter too are real nice and quick to welcome you and wish you well as you leave, belly pleasantly full and an likely a big smirk on your face."}
{"text":"I stopped by this place yesterday for my first time.  Service was great and burger was huge and tasty.  I really enjoyed it with reasonable price.  I would love to come back and try omelet next time."}
{"text":"Folks, if you're looking for a no frills, delicious, inexpensive meal look no further. The service is kind and competent, the coffee strong, hot and plentiful and the food delish. I prefer the fries to the home fries but that's just me. True value, no nonsense. The men who cook are skilled and gentlemen and you can ask for any modification you want. My only 'complaint' is the bathrooms could be updated. But I can pee anywhere lol"}
{"text":"This place is legit, a neighbourhood institution. I eat here a few times a week, the food is simple but always consistent and served with a smile."}
{"text":"Formerly \"Stavros\",  this place has had a major reno, in both decor and menu. It is an improvement, and my 3 friends and I enjoyed our various breakfasts. It was a good, greasy spoon breakfast - just not quite as greasy as it used to be. The waitress was friendly and attentive. It's not a destination, but if you're in the hood..."}
{"text":"This place feels like cheers. \"Sometimes you wanna go where every body knows your naaaame\". Very mellow atmosphere and quality food for fair pricing. I got a Canadian burger w cheese ham ketchup on it and it was fab. So juicy and delicious my mouth waters just thinking about it! The sweet potatoe fries where thick and flavourful and a great side sauces to too it off! Kinda a Divey feel, but super cozy. When needing quality diner food- this place hits the spot. Quality coffee, big plate of sweet potatoe fries and big burger for -15 after tax and tip...awesome! Main downfall is coffee is non refillable but they did let me take a to go cup which was nice!"}
{"text":"Was just walking by this place last weekend on the way to get a flat on my bike fixed. I liked the look of it, and was craving a greasy breakie, so we tried it. 
So good. I had the mandatory 3 eggs and CRISPY bacon with rye toast and hashbrowns. Service was super friendly and the food was good. The only thing i might change is i quite like a pot of tea with my breakfast, not just a wee little cup. But that's ok. If i was really bothered i could have just asked for a refill. But i was done my food so fast, it didn't matter. 
I'll be coming here again :)"}
{"text":"Was here this morning for breakfast. Had the eggs Benny. Well priced and tasty. My husband and I enjoyed it."}
{"text":"I mainly was going to Pete's for breakfast. The food was good given the low prices here, but the coffee is the worst I've ever tasted. I'm not even a fancy coffee drinker. They charge for coffee when you order breakfast, which I don't mind, but then If you are going to charge for coffee please at least buy some decent coffee beans. I had to stop going here for breakfast that's how bad the coffee is. Shortly after I started coming here they had originally included coffee with one breakfast special on weekends but now they charge for all refills at over $2 a cup! And it takes like 3 day old burnt coffee. The price and quality of the coffee killed this spot as our new breakfast place"}
{"text":"Good local neighbourhood spot. Pretty decent Greek souvlaki and chicken Greek salad options.  It's a charming local diner. Manage your expectations and you'll be pleased."}
{"text":"Service is nice. The restaurant is super clean and sweet. The food is from frozen. The dips are all bulk. The Greek salad is just cheap oil and a lot of low quality feta. Just not worth the money. But the burgers did look amazing for sure!"}
{"text":"This place is my go-to whenever I am too tired to cook, but you have to know who is working. I just ordered the souvlaki plate which I have had before and really enjoyed it, but this time the rice was old and scarce, the potatoes were just sad and the chicken was related to sawdust. Oh! and they forgot to dress the salad. I really do love this place their daytime staff is great and the guys behind the line can turn out a good meal quickly, the waitstaff are really sweet as well. I just wish they would find one solid evening cook for the line and so it isn't like playing Russian roulette."}
{"text":"A greasy spoon standard for breakfast.

The eggs benedict was decent. Prices are good. Service is fair.

Sadly, they charge for coffee refills."}
{"text":"While most of my trips down to Parkdale have been for Himalayan food (at various restaurants previously reviewed), I have dropped in to Pete's Corner Grill a few times for some good ol' diner food and a chance to relax at the end of the day. There's nothing special about the diner itself, it's very bright with large windows, maybe 20 tables and an open kitchen behind the counter. The washroom is clean, but could really use an update. Usually I have been there in the afternoon or after work, and it has never been too busy, but there are always a few people eating in or getting take-out. I would say the high point is that their service is fast and very friendly, better than most other places I have been. One of the cooks always says hello or goodbye as I pass, and the waitress is always around for coffee refills. There's a tv that seems to always show CP24 news, and music that plays in the background, and colouring books and pencils for the kids that come in.

The first time that I went recently, I had one of their daily specials: the hot chicken sandwich with mashed potatoes and gravy ($11.99); there was a lot of chicken and the potatoes and gravy were great. The last time I was there, I had the chili and toast daily special ($5.99), which was delicious but a bit small for a meal. Only once did I have a late breakfast of steak and eggs with home fries and toast ($10.99); the steak was a decent size and well-cooked, and I got to have some HP sauce with it (not something that I see around much anymore). The menu has the standard diner fare, including all-day breakfast, and there's a chalkboard with the daily specials written out. Their milkshakes are thick and quite good, and although I have not had any as yet, there always seems to be pie for dessert.

Overall, good food at good prices with great service, and a great place to wind down at the end of the day."}
{"text":"It's okay here, cheap and decent food Felt I had to leave a lacklustre review today because they treated me like I was invisible. But they definitely love their regulars, so invest some money here if you live in the area."}
{"text":"had a burger n fries based on a website recommendation - big mistake !  fries were awful - 1st time in 10 yr i didn't finishe my fries and i love fries - waitress was very dis-interested but i still tipped her - had to ask for my bill 5 times - she seemd more interested in talking to staff   - i said 'i love tomatoes' she heard \"gibve me 2 sleces' - wont't go back ! oh and on a very hot day Today  26 aug 2016 - a/c was turned OFF"}
{"text":"If you want a classic all-day breakfast spot, Pete's is for you. No glitz or glam, just good ol' fashion eggs and bacon. Such a good addition to a lazy parkdale day."}
{"text":"Having gone by this place endless times, my friend suggested we go here for breakfast. Finally, here was my chance.

Any greasy spoon has a certain charm right? Not so polished, not so healthy in food or cleanliness. There's a certain grime factor. This place somewhat surprised me. 

I recall it had another name, Stavros but discovered it had recently undergone a massive renovation. All I have to say is, interesting decorative choice. It has this 80's/90's feel.  It's actually, not bad in there at all.

Ordering my breakfast of scrambled eggs and sausage with an americano . I was pleasantly surprised at all of it. The coffee was good and the breakfast/ grease ratio - not bad at all.

Totally, would go here again. Inexpensive neighbourhood joint!"}
{"text":"We were doing some holiday shopping in the Parkdale area and wanted to grab some food to fuel our retail therapy.  We peeked inside Pete's and it was pretty busy on a Sunday morning so that's a good sign.

We were shown a table right away and everything looked good on the menu for breakfast standards to diner essentials.  I initially wanted to order a corn beef sandwich but our server mentioned that they were currently sold out.  She recommended the Montreal smoked meat sandwich ($7.99) and I added fries and salad on the side ($2.99).  We also ordered a Banquet burger with fries ($10.99) and coffees.

My meat sandwich was surprisingly delish.  The meat was soft and moist and the rye bread was extremely fresh.  The burger did not disappoint - very juicy and flavourful.  

Service was very friendly and efficient from a server who seemed genuinely delighted to meet our toddler (for a change).

An unexpectedly satisfying brunch at a place we've passed many times.  Highly recommended over Easy, just down the block.  Pete's has no line, no attitude and no terrible food."}
{"text":"Good food, generous portions, great price. 

I like the veggie burger. I get it with the combo. The salad is oily, so next time, I will ask them not to put oil on it, I'll eat it plain."}
{"text":"A bright, friendly, unpretentious local greasy spoon with a good breakfast special. I'm there all the time."}
{"text":"That pre-11am three egg, meat, toast, home fries and coffee breakfast for $6.99 deserves it's own review. Here is said review. Long live Pete!"}
{"text":"Clean, efficient and friendly little diner. The breakfast special (3 eggs, bacon/ham/sausage, toast, potatoes and a coffee for 6.49) is a steal and I'll definitely be back for another visit."}
