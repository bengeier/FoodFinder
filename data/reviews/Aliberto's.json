{"text":"They make the best tostadas and rolled tacos they are very good their customers they always smile and know me everytime i come in thank you for great food and nice people"}
{"text":"Darn good Mexican food in huge portions and a reasonable price. Although the staff might not all speak fluent English, they're always polite. It's a family owned and operated business, too!"}
{"text":"I was there nearly two weeks ago and ordered a chicken burrito. They asked if I wanted grilled chicken and I said yes. I took it home and ate it. It was a good size, so I was psyched. But the chicken wasn't grilled. It was like chicken that is par-boiled. That didn't bother me too much, but what DID bother me was that I bit into TWO chicken bones! Needless to say, I was not pleased. Not sure if I'll ever go back. Too bad, because it was my first time."}
{"text":"The food here is always delicious and excellent.  The service can be slow but the staff is very friendly every time.  I would recommend this place to other for sure."}
{"text":"This place is GREAT, I am Latino, invited other  Latinos, and friends all loved it. Tried a lot not everything but will try."}
{"text":"I've been dreading this day....  When we 1st moved to Mesa (2 years ago) we loved that this place was so close (see previous review). Now, we've seen a drastic change in the quality of food. The horchata is never consistent. The sauce is 'okay' 50% of the time. The food overall has gotten to be pretty bland and a we've regretted the last several meals. I don't think we'll be back :("}
{"text":"For what looks like the typical 'bertos chain, this was surprisingly good.  I just got a standard Combo Number 1.  It was a Tostada, Taco, Rice, and Beans.  Everything was good.  A lot of these places have very sub-par beans which is a shame because it is such a foundational component of Mexican cooking.  I thought they were pretty good and they weren't all crusty like you see at a lot of the 'berto chains.  I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"always mess up my nachos. never give me back change. i ask them not to put pico de gallo and then they take off the beans or anything else. sometimes they just put everything in it. ALWAYS CHECK YOUR ORDER BEFORE YOU LEAVE. & ASK FOR A RECIEPT. like if my total was 8.23 they round it to 8.25.. they've done it to me many times on the drive thru."}
{"text":"I had the rolled tacos. Heavenly!!! With ample guacamole and sour cream and shredded cheese.  And the price can't be beat."}
{"text":"OH YES I DID!  I have to give this Aliberto guy some credit. While your favorite brand of engineered beverage, personal hygiene liquid, or processed food snack is proudly helping you through the recession by offering 11.5 oz of product in the same 14 oz container- this guy sticks to the game plan.  You can still get the original 5,000 calorie taco salad for less than six bucks, and the Beef Chimichanga STILL comes with a heart stalling wad of shredded beef, fajita vegetables, and fried tortilla smothered in alarming portions of sour cream, guac, and cheese. They are just too legit to quit.  This Aliberto's is also family owned- Mom, Dad, Uncle, two son's and a daughter all work here. And the place is squeeky clean inside. All of the ingredients in the requisite Burrito fixins' bar are always fresh- sliced cucumbers, limes, carrots, red and green sauce.  ...and you can get the ice cold bottles of Coke from Mexico that have real cane sugar. So, it's (ahem) actually healthy."}
{"text":"Been there a lot in the last year. My husband is addicted to the fish tacos and I have a love affair with the the rolled tacos!"}
{"text":"This place is near my job, it's got a great variety of breakfast burritos also your basics on Mexican food. It's fast, is easy, I stop by when I won't have time to eat due the rest of the day. They give you enough food to fill you for breakfast and lunch or lunch and dinner which makes it great for a busy girl. It's drive thru, the people are good, honest and quick. The only reason it's not a 5 star is because the speaker you give your order to is hard to hear if they have received your order correctly. It needs to be fixed for both them and the customer. I'll be going back I like the food I like the service. Thank you for being consistent"}
{"text":"Chorizo breakfast burrito was fairly good, but a bit dry. Could of just been the potatoes though. That being said I would order it again. Overall a nice place to drive through on the way to work to grab a fast breakfast on the go."}
{"text":"ya wife likes the place, i found it to be funky tasting chicken beans not good   mama not that friendly she was more friendly to my wife"}
{"text":"Carne asada burritos are watery. Seems like meat cooked in a crockpot. The flavor is good. But just too watery for me. There rice and beans are good."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! They give large potions. My kids love the rolled tacos, and carne asada fries.. They're shredded beef taco plate is a go to for me!"}
{"text":"Good location for fast Mexican food, typical of all the various -berto's around the valley. Very fast service and cheap prices. I got the \"supreme\" rolled tacos which were a little different than I've seen - rolled tacos topped with more taco meat, cheese, guacamole, lettuce, and sour cream. I got mine without tomatoes. Very good!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I love going here for their breakfast burritos. Always fresh and the guy cooking the food always double checks with us to make sure we want everything that comes in the burrito or whatever we get. Their guacamole and chips are great and they give you a ton! The rolled tacos and carne asana torta are a couple of our favorites. This place is great!!!"}
{"text":"DO NOT EAT HERE! If you're looking for a home cooked meal, Mexican style.. then this is not the place. The outside gave me a skeptical vibe but my husband insisted we should give them a try. I found 2 eyelashes in my Sopes. We're pescatarian, so no meat for us. We asked for shrimp. The shrimp still had skin on It... wait, what??They're overpriced in my opinion. Not sure how one quesadilla and two sopes came out to $29. The ingredients they use tasted super low quality. Their refried beans with the cheap cheddar cheese they use to garnish, just makes you want to throw up after looking at itt. I'm so upset I wasted my money eating here. Another thing that completely pissed me off, is my 2 year old son saw saltine crackers on their picture to accompany the ceviche. I asked if I could have just the saltines for my son. The rep. said she doesn't have any -- that those are old and outdated pictures, understandable! So, I asked if I could have a few chips for my boy instead. She said I have some for sale for $3. I just spent almost $30!!! You couldn't add complimentary chips, like other Mexican places do?! Jesus. And to top It allllllll off, my stomach hurts 30 minutes after eating those Sopes. This is no Gem. This is a rathole with low quality food. The staff sucks."}
{"text":"Hands down the best I ever found! I come to az a lot and I try to find new places! By far the best drive thru food i ever ate! Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"I like this place. It is a classic BERTOS chain. I always get the bean and cheese burrito. The only thing I would change would be please improve your RED sauce! Red sauce is kinda iffy each time and wish the red sauce was tastier. Also the workers are very friendly. They don't speak too much English, (hablan un poco pero no entienden mucho del ingl√©s). Also please wear gloves when preparing the food!!"}
