{"text":"The restaurant seemed nice from outside, so we went in but when we placed the order, I was extremely disappointed with the service as we wanted to make a change in the order and the server simply refused. I did not like the attitude at all. More disappointing was the food- we did a take out-the veges looked dead and lacked flavor what so ever. The rice stir fry- rice was not mixed into the veges at all, we actually ended up throwing the food in the garbage. Waste of time and money."}
{"text":"I got the tonkotsu ramen and the broth did not have much flavor at all. This was probably on par with a bag of Top Ramen noodles that you can make at home. If you want good ramen, do not go here! The dish was quite disappointing and I would not recommend this place to anyone. I give it 2 stars instead of 1 since it did fill me up but that's all it did."}
{"text":"Consider Zyng as an overpriced Thai Express. I had the soba noodles with grilled chicken and spicy peanut sauce, and it was fairly disappointing. The food wasn't flavourful, the proportions were small, and the chicken was dry. Equally disappointing was the vermicelli with grilled chicken that my friend had.  The waiter we dealt with was also quite crude. As we had placed a takeout order, we had declined to tip because no service had been provided. Immediately after paying for our meals, however, the waiter processing our transaction asked us forthright whether we would be tipping in cash now, or tipping later. This is really poor waiter etiquette, and while we acquiesced, we should not have been asked that question at all."}
{"text":"Nourriture toujours très fraîche pour un lunch à prix assez modique! Après avoir essayé autant leurs choix déjà préparés au menu ainsi que les bols a assembler soi-même, je peux affirmer qu'on ne se trompe pas dans un cas comme dans l'autre.  Les bols a assembler ont l'avantage d'offrir une grande variétés de combinaisons tant pour les choix de nouilles que de sauces (toutes très savoureuses, mon dernier coup de coeur est pour Arachide épicée!). Vraiment, on ne se trompe pas! Sinon mon incontournable dans leurs autres repas est sans doute le pad thaï (choix convenu peut-être, mais il était excellent chaque fois que je l'ai essayé ici)"}
{"text":"Nous avons bien aimé! On a pris des bols a faire soit meme, malgré un boeuf un peu sec surcuit, les legumes les sauces etait bon et c est bien copieux! Par contre ils se sont trompés dans la commande en ne mettant pas les bonnes nouilles mais on a pas pinaillé et on a quand meme tout mangé! Donc dans l ensemble c est bon, il y a mieux certes mais le choix est assez vaste, c est copieux mais ca reste un peu cher. 17$ par tete pour un seul plat. A vous de juger!"}
{"text":"I walked in after a too long walk, was addressed immediately by friendly staff, got to pick where I sat, and then ordered a miso soup and steam/fried gyoza beef dumplings. I was really encouraged by all the fresh fruit and veggies on display, and by the decor. Clean and pretty, and the furniture of asian-fusion blend without being really obnoxiously fake. The place focuses on asian noodles, so the fact that I ordered a Japanese soup and Chinese dumplings was probably a bit odd of me - however I took the risk and the miso was home-made, delicious, and awesome. The dumplings were soooooo good. The waitress who served me told me the dumplings here are her favourite!  Two very happy thumbs up  - I can always tell I'm going to have to come back when I'm sad after licking my plate clean. I feel like next time I should order 40 dumplings instead of just 12."}
{"text":"The food is really good, calm and relax ambiance. I went with some friends and everybody liked it! The portion are big, enough to make you full. Great place to go if you have a date. Good job."}
{"text":"Wow welp, after dining here the other day I'm not really impressed with this place. If the old and stale memes decorating the front don't make you want to turn around and walk away, the food just might.  Together my friend and I ordered miso ramen, a make-your-own dish meal, and a side of chicken dumplings [they didn't have pork, which puzzled me since pork is the staple dumple protein]  The dumplings were okay, but very small. The make-your-own dish was sad and small with very little meat.  It's more like a novelty dish. The idea is fun and interesting at first, but the execution is very lacking. Now the miso ramen was... pretty bad. It didn't taste like there was any miso in the soup at all, the toppings were in small quantities, and the noodles where undercooked and clumped together.  It was edible but very disappointing.  The place itself is nice and the service was alright, it was right on top of a pokestop which was a bonus. Pokemon Go made the long wait for the food pass by faster, but once Pokemon Go is irrelevant, there's really not much going for this place. I'd say the best part of the meal was the fortune cookie at the end and the Pikachu we managed to catch there, which is sad.  So yeah, probably not coming back here again."}
{"text":"Dined here last night... There was just one server, who was really nice. The menu isn't in English, like the other places. I'm just visiting and do not Speak French. I ordered dumplings and the bowl of Pho.  The dumplings were tiny and some parts of the dough was super dry. The pho was plentiful. Would I opt to go back? Probably not."}
{"text":"Cheap-good-spicy-fast service  I just love this place. You can customize your noodle bowl with choosing the meat you want, the veggies and the kind of noodles. Not to mention the sauces. The best is thaï curry-coco in my opinion, it is sweet and spicy and goes very well with Udon Noodles.   for approx 13$ that's what you get, and you get out of there full, and your wallet is not too light :)"}
{"text":"This place has a fairly good variety of Asian food, from Japanese to Thai. The spring rolls were some of the most delicious I've ever had, I'll definitely come back for more! It is not cheap, but the atmosphere in the restaurant is nice and comfy. The service was prompt and warm. I'm really looking forward to my next visit. The only downside I find is that here are not a lot of options when it comes to drinks and desserts, but still, the place is worth a shot."}
{"text":"We spotted this noodlery and husband was sold. It was the \"noodlery\" part that did it.  This is one of those places where you can customize your meal- choose the noodle, the sauce, the protein and the veg. I opted for an entree- shrimp with a sesame-based sauce, some rice and veg. It was good. Husband ate his up! A fun, inexpensive dinner."}
{"text":"My friends and I found everything too salty or sweet. And they dont use the right cuts of beef for our different meals. We all had the same beef cut... I had thick slices that were hard to chew to do being overcooked in my pho... No authenticity in any of their dishes.   Personally, I'll never go there again."}
{"text":"I took my mother here for dinner because it is a fun little interactive place where you can pick your protein, veg, and noodles.   Not a fancy place by any means. We had a decent meal, which was cooked properly.  The menu is big and can get a bit overwhelming with so many choices of noodles, sauces, and so forth.  A great place for a date, or quick meal."}
{"text":"This is the only restaurant in Montreal that i consistently return.  It's inexpensive and the food is delicious.  I enjoy being able to customize my own meal.  You have three sections where you choose your choice of noodles (ban pho, shanghai soba, udon), protein (shrimp, beef, chicken, tofu) and flavouring (teriyaki, yakisoba, pineapple curry).  I miss zyng."}
{"text":"Le poulet général Tao était excellent et pour le prix il est impossible de s'en plaindre (rabais etudiant). Le service était très bon, rien à redire. Le restaurent est très bien situé sur la rue St-Denis il est donc facile de poursuivre la soirée dans les quelques bars dans les alentours."}
{"text":"Un faible pour le Général Tao, mais avec les nouilles cantonaises, je trouve ça plus sympa... Il y la possibilité de choisir ses légumes pour les Woks cuits à la demande, dans le buffet. Le thé maison est très rafraîchissant. En été, la terrasse sur Saint-Denis est encore plus agréable lorsque la rue est piétonne."}
{"text":"Tell y'all the truth...this is the first place I've been to here in Montreal around the Downtown area that actually does cook their food with HEAT, (I mean heat as HOT, and SPICY).  As a American from Dallas, Texas...we LOVE food with HEAT...and this place definitely does a great job doing so.  Now that I've found this place...I'll be coming back for me for more!!!  :)"}
{"text":"You might like this place is you're into bland food. Reasons NOT to eat here: 1) it will take 45 minutes to get food on off-peak hours 2) im pretty sure the Sriracha was fake 3) absolutely no flavor"}
{"text":"Even Montreal, that city of the great white north known for its French styled bistros, has its representation into a trend getting traction south of the border, that is,   Puzzle Food.   Puzzle Food is where you walk into a casual place that is pick and choose items from a list of 3 or 4 variables, and put the pieces together however you want to make them fit to make your Puzzle meal.   Except this place has been around perhaps 10 - 12 years, so maybe Puzzle food started here?   It is a Puzzling question.   This place is sort of like Mongolian Barbecue meets Pan-Asian noodle house.   The Puzzle pieces are:  1. Pick the noodle you want (a variety of Chinese, Vietnamese, Japanese and other noodle favorites) 2. Pick your protein (chicken, beef, tofu, etc. ) 3. Pick the sauce you want (again, sweet, sweet and sour, spicy, soy sauce, etc. ) 4. Pick the veggies from the veggie bar that you want added to your noodles.   Then wait for the cook to grill it all up, and the waitress to bring you it to your table with the beverage of your choice. Not that Puzzling really.   This is cheap stuff. $9.99 and $12.99 covers most any combo you want. So it is cheap enough that you don't have to Puzz around (oops did I mean don't be a Putz?) and just come in and order something. But not on a first date.   If you don't like your Japanese Udon noodles with the American broccoli and cauliflower you chose in the spicy Thai sauce you selected, who's fault is that?   Why do you look Puzzled with this question?  You Puzz!"}
{"text":"J'adore ce restaurant!! J'ai un faible pour les bols repas qu'on peut composer soi-même en choisissant la sorte de nouilles/riz, les légumes dans le bar à légumes frais et la sauce.  Je conseille ce restaurant à tous les amateurs de bonne bouffe."}
{"text":"Je ne suis jamais entièrement satisfaire quand je vais au zyng et pourtant lorsque je regarde mes photos je me dis tout semble succulent. La présentation est parfaite mais en bouche j\"ai quelques réserves. Le boeuf caoutchouteux, le poulet du général tao qu'on a du mal à identifier et un pad thai moyen. Oui le prix est raisonnable mais je trouve de meilleurs saveurs dans le resto thai peu connu du quartier. J'aime l'ambiance du resto je finis toujours par y revenir 1 fois par an leur donner une chance. J'aime l'option de pouvoir créer sa propre assiette, choisir ses légumes, ses nouilles et sauce. À tenter!"}
{"text":"Great service but the food was bad and they messed up the bill double taxing us. The dumplings were good but the noodles with beef weren't. The beef was very chewy."}
{"text":"THE WORST RESTAURANT I'VE BEEN TO!! PLEASE DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY IN HERE.  I am not exaggerating really. We went here with a snow storm in Montreal and looking for a ramen place but it was really a bad choice. To start off, the ramen is really really cold. Who serves ramen like that? When we ask to warm it up the server said that it will just make the taste more bland if they will do so. The noodles is soggy, the broth is trash! I think even the instant ones has better taste on what they are serving. We ordered gyoza too, bad choice again! It's like frozen and doesn't have a taste at all! This is a nightmare for us. We didn't even touch our food and the server ask if he can serve us a tea and we just said NO thanks because we can't wait to leave the place. Never coming back to this place!"}
{"text":"We were a family of three including our 3 year old.  645 pm and we were starving.  This was the place that I am sentimental as its the first Resturant that I had been in Montreal.  Today the service was poor.  There was only one waitress and clearly she was struggling to serve 10 people alone.  This tensed the cook and he too was struggling to keep up and it reflected on the food.  The spring rolls were over cooked /fried while our noodles was underdone.  We got the starters after 45 minutes and main course after an hour.  Clearly a forgettable experience.  Now we understand why the mount royal branch was closed.  Sorry zyng....."}
