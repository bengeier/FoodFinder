{"text":"Can't say enough good things about the food here. Went with a group of four and shared a wide variety of items and everything was delicious. Started with two guacamoles (goat cheese and orange) and the sikil pak. The chancho tamale (definitely add the fried egg!) was fabulous. As were the sides we tried (empanaditas, pork belly refritos, and my personal favorite, the creamed corn). I would like to say I was able to enjoy my leftovers the next day, but there weren't any. Not for lack of food, it was just too good! Top it all off with a margarita sampler, and you have one delightful evening. Oh, and I never drink coffee but my friends convinced me to try theirs and wow. Yum. Overall, a great addition to the greater Cleveland food scene. Looking forward to more visits."}
{"text":"Some of the best guacamole I've ever had. The margaritas are fantastic as well."}
{"text":"This place is great! I've now had three different types of their tamales(pork,briscut, & short-rib) and they have all been fantastic.
They serve theirs with the meat on top, not filled like traditional style. But, the portions are huge and the flavor is undeniably delicious.
I've had all the guacs, and they do those good as well. I like the orange guacamole the best. It's kinda hard to mess up guacamole though.
I'm not that into margaritas, but my friends ordered the triple sampler and loved theirs. The Rooster being their favorite. I played it safe with just a pineapple 'rita and it was definitely refreshing and mixed perfect with real muddled pineapple, not just canned juice concentrate.
On to the service... I always sit at the bar and it's always been very friendly. Last time in, I had the bartender order for me and she delivered in a great way.
Also, on my last visit, the manager recognized my little group and without hesitation, brought all three of us a quality shot of tequila right off the bat on the house for being repeat guests. After our guac sampler came out, he surprised us with some sort of shrimp tapas. I don't know if it's on the menu, but it should be. A perfectly seasoned and spiced shrimp served over a little nest of spinach and some other ingredients I can't quite remember. That couple bites of food alone was a standout to my meal.
Highly recommend this place. No, you're not gonna get a soggy $3 Barrio style taco here. What you'll get is some of the best \"Mod Mex\" anywhere. This is a legit dinner operation. Not a bar for late night drunk hipsters.
The atmosphere is quite colorful and well adorned with pop-Mexican art.
If I had only one complaint, and this is a minor one, they are closed on Mondays when I'm usually off work. But many places in Lakewood are.
Try this place sooner than later!"}
{"text":"Delicious food.  We started with the margarita sampler, in which the mango was my favorite.  I usually can't stand tequila, but theirs is very smooth.   The goat cheese and regular guacamole were amazing and also very filling to have before dinner, but if you're there, I'd get it.  Within my party of 4 people, we all split 3 entrees of taquitos.  Al Pastor (pork) was the best and the other 2 Bistec (steak) and Camaron (shrimp) were very good as well.  To drive by this building, which is the former McCarthys in Lakewood, I'd pass this restaurant right up without stopping based on outside appearance.  Nothing attractive on the outside and parking is scarce.  The only reason I went is because I heard it was the same owner/chef as Momocho and that place is delicious.  On a Saturday night in August, we waited 20 minutes for a table, not bad.  When we were done eating a couple hours later, the place was kind of cleared out.  Overall, I liked this restaurant and would definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant several times now and I have been completely satisfied every time. The food is fresh and delicious and there are several different types of guacamole to try. It is also extremely fresh not like the garbage that you get at Subway or any other place that wants to specialize in guacamole now. They also have great happy hour specials with margaritas and appetizers. The atmosphere is fun and casual.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Always love the food. Always love our drinks. And ALWAYS have fabulous service. Been to El C about 10 times. Have only sat at bar to dine. Zero complaints. Love it!!"}
{"text":"Being in my neighborhood,  we have made many trips to el carnicero. Margaritas are delicious, I enjoy getting a sampler as they always have something new to try. The wild boar nachos are the best thing on the menu and the huevos rancheros is the best version of this dish around! I'm personally not too into the tamales or taquitos, my fianc√© loves it, but the salsas, guacs, and nachos are so good they usually end up being my meal . I recommend coming for happy hour and definitely trying the brunch"}
{"text":"Everything is always delicious. Service is always great. The only thing I wish were different is their house margarita. It isn't bad but tastes like they use a mix."}
{"text":"Upset we haven't tried El Carnicero sooner!! From the drinks, to the guacamole, to our entrees, and the service.. everything was fantastic! We ordered goat cheese guac (yummy), chorizo 
Tamales, and shrimp taquitos. The chorizo tamales were to die for (get the egg on top)! Shrimp taquitos were very good but maybe would ordered a different kind next time to try something new. We had our son with us in the stroller and they were all super accommodating!"}
{"text":"Tried them out last weekend for lunch, and was not disappointed. Started off with chips and the goat cheese guac, and the pumpkin seed salsa-amazing!  Best guac I've ever had, and the salsa was very good, not what I expected, great flavor. Tamales were excellent, with meat, fall off the bone tender.  Took the servers suggestion to add a fried egg, delicious!  Sampled several Margaritas, the blood orange, and mango, and again they didn't disappoint. Great flavored, very drinkable. Our server was excellent. We took every suggestion she gave, and were very satisfied. She was always attentive, and took good care if us. If you're looking for some great authentic Mexican cuisine, I'd say this is one of the best in town. Just be prepared, it's decorated with Mexican wrestler paraphernalia. Different from your usual sombreros, and imitation Aztec sculptures."}
{"text":"I really didn't think it was that good. And, for the amount I paid for a casual lunch (approx. $30 after tip), it should have been better.

I went there with a friend on a Saturday afternoon, right around 12:30. There was one other couple eating lunch at the time. Yet, it took nearly an hour for us to get our food. The food was subpar. I had the mahi mahi and my friend had the carne asada. Once again, it was just okay. We also split the Brussel sprouts, which were my favorite part. They were marinated in Mexican coke, and quite delicious. 

The decor of this place is cool. I can see it getting very busy at night, and it definitely has a nice, modern vibe to it. I've heard it's the sister restaurant of Momocho, which is supposed to be one of the best spots in Cleveland. I really don't think I would try either again. I'd much rather spend 30 bucks on something that had a bit more flavor to enjoy."}
{"text":"One star rating because we waited 45 minutes to get our cards returned to us after paying our bill. Ridiculous. The food was pretty good, not great for the price. The margaritas were tasty! They do not give separate checks no matter what which is a huge inconvenience. We had a party of 7 so we wrote our last names next to which item we got so she could charge the correct cards for the right items.  We went to look for our waitress after about 20 minutes and no one knew where she was. Another 25 minutes later she came back exclaiming that this was the hardest thing she's ever had to do. I'm not sure what they expect people to do...a huge inconvenience especially when it takes longer to pay then to eat."}
{"text":"Unique flavors, tons of choices, the best guacamole you can find although they got rid of the sesame habanero variety which is a mistake in my opinion.

Its pricier if you plan to drink a bit so its not an every weekend kinda place."}
{"text":"A group of us were excited to check out the new restaurant.  We were shocked as the food was terrible!  It was very bland and had no taste.  The staff was also extremely rude to our table.  One of our party emailed the owner and he never responded.  I will NEVER eat here again."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that Mexican food is my favorite so when I find a good restaurant I am very excited.  This is a good restaurant.  It is definitely not Tex-Mex so if you are looking for that or are hesitant to try more unique dishes, this place might take you out of your comfort zone.  Try it, though!  We took my mom who was visiting from Cincinnati last week and she isn't always one to try new places and she loved it.  The margarita flight is awesome...I haven't tried a bad flavor.  The goat cheese guacamole is heavenly.  Just thinking about it is making me want to go get an order.  Mmmm that and the brisket...SO GOOD!  
We have been twice (less than a week apart) and had great service both times (high tops by the bar with a server named Ryan both times).  I'm not sure what the other bad reviews would be from when it comes to service.  He was exactly the type of server I like.  Answers questions when asked.  Never have a drink more than half empty.  Not overwhelming.  
Overall I would highly recommend!
Side note- the portion sizes are HUGE so you could definitely share an entree."}
{"text":"The food is amazing! Tamales are awesome. The braised brisket is the best. Also highly recommend the guacamole with goat cheese!"}
{"text":"This place is perfect! Their waitstaff is wonderful, every time my boyfriend and I come in they greet us like friends. Their margaritas are always incredibly delicious, the food is amazing and the service is wonderful."}
{"text":"Love, love, love. One of my favorite restaurants in Cleveland. Everything I've ever had here was fab. I only wish they would open one on the east side! Pretty please?"}
{"text":"Been here three times all bad... was hoping for the best since we love momocho. 

HORRIBLE service! We had a group of eight. Took 30 minutes for our drinks then took another 30 minutes for the waiter to come take our order. After that we didn't see our waiter again until the first meal showed up... which was an hour after we ordered. Meaning we have only had one drink at this point as well. Once the food came it didn't come at once it was all staggered. By the time the last person got their food if was another twenty minutes until the last person was served. The food was awful and COLD. At this point we had to hunt down a waiter/hostess so we could get our bill. It took three hours for us to finish our meal and leave. 

Will NOT go back!"}
{"text":"God dammit I though this place was going to be good.   I read a magazine review that mentioned the Al Pastor Tamale and I was all jazzed to eat it, but it was really quite boring and the tortillas that came with it just added to the snooze-fest. The only thing that stood out at our dinner was the terrible service. The server couldn't get our checks right and I ended up having to bring in the front of the house manager just to get a fucking margarita flight voided. You are getting an auto 20% gratuity on a 14 top that you gave shit service to, why are you arguing with me about a margarita?  

To sum up, shit service, boring carnitas. If you do go try the guacamole flight and the blood orange margarita.  But, bottom line service needs to improve in order to for this place to have a fighting chance of being around next year."}
{"text":"Great space, though cavernous it's broken up into three rooms. There's just enough of Momocho's favorite drinks and dinners in addition to many new dishes. The best tamales in town. Never have I had such light, perfectly cooked through, cornmeal loaded down with a generous portion of succulent short ribs or any of the equally enticing meat toppings. There's an abundance of meat choices in the tamale and tacquito offerings. Also, glad to see there's at least one vegetarian offering in practically every category. In addition, to your favorite margarita offerings from Momocho, El Chango offers up some newly inspired drinks. Love the Paloma among others. The rich meaty flavor of the duck confit taquitos is not to be missed either. Great addition to the Lakewood restaurant/bar scene. Looking forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"Love the carnitas entree! The gauc is amazing as well. Had a awesome time. We had a reservation of 12 people and had a large table in a room off the restaurant. Loved how private it was and how friendly our server was. Thanks and we will be back!"}
{"text":"I feel guilty deviating from the typical review. My dinner crew (3 couples) first tried to go to Momocho but couldn't get in due to crowd. we recently tried here with mixed reviews. we went on Saturday evening fully expecting a wait and the hipster host told us in a bored, disinterested tone that it was a one hour wait. no big deal just have a drink at bar. close to two hours later we asked same bored disinterested host how long. After all the wait the food was meh for. Maybe an off night but I really didn't see what the big deal was. However, margaritas were pretty good"}
{"text":"Great service, great atmosphere, great everything but the food. I ordered the pork belly and salsa Verde. Seriously, no flavor to the pork belly and the salsa could have been store bought. Ugh, I really wanted to like this place! I might have to give it another shot."}
{"text":"One of our all-time favorites!! We have moved out of Ohio and have considered taking a trip out there all the way from Texas just to eat at El Carnicero! We've yet to find a Mod Mex place that can compete, so maybe someday we will go back. Excellent margaritas and the guacamole sampler is always superb! The chancho and costilla tamales are amazing! We originally fell in love with the sister restaurant, Momocho, but El Carnicero was less drive-time and, in my opinion, a larger and nicer establishment. Plus, the service seemed to be a little better. A must try!!"}
{"text":"Had an enjoyable, although expensive, late lunch post-Lakewood Arts Festival at El C.    The space is well-designed and interesting.   And, it's large!    We were there at an off time (230 pm) and there was a scattering of patrons that barely registered in the space.

I'm thrilled that El C is down the block.   For the most part, the food is enjoyable.   And the drinks are, too.

Had both a blood orange margarita and, my Momocho fave, a cucumber marg.   No need to try the orange again, but the cucumber still remains an old friend.   Their chips, served warm and salty, are my new frenemy.    So damn good, but I can't stop.  And, who needs all those calories.  Three of us ate three baskets of chips.   That's just wrong.

My dining friends enjoyed their tamales and I liked-but-did-not-love my bistec taquitos.   The server envouraged me to enjoy them medium rare which I love;however, they came out medium and not very warm - probably kept waiting for the other two dishes and kept cooking, I surmise.   Good, but wouldnt order them again based on that.  

The price for lunch with 5 drinks was $100+ so not terribly unexpected, but always a bit jarring when you realize you just had lunch.   

Good stuff ...and Ill be back for more chips and a cucumber margarita, I'm sure."}
{"text":"skip it. really gave it a good try but just doesnt cut it. offers less bang for bigger bucks."}
{"text":"Get the duck taquitos- oh my god. Melt in your mouth. The goat cheese guacamole is amazing too. Favorite marg is the cucumber one with the cayenne salt rim. Friendly staff and amazing decor!"}
{"text":"When you walk in it seems like a bar, but as you move through the space it opens into a nice dining room. Try the open face tamale, carnitas and margaritas. 
This spot is good for a date night.
Happy hour is only at the bar. 
If you have a chance To speak with the manager Eric, he is a delight and I recommend it."}
{"text":"Really disappointing trip! We ordered empanadas to split and mine had a huge dark hair baked into it. I normally don't say anything but literally it was baked into it. When I did say something our server chuckled and took them away and we were brought new ones. No apology. Our entrees were nothing special, tasty but not impressed. On top of everything the service was just not there, I didn't get a refill on water until I was done eating and then we were charged for the empanadas.... Again didn't say anything bc they replaced them but if/when I was a server I would have taken them off. This was my second experience there and the first was 100% better."}
{"text":"Food is alright. But the service is so slow I could slaughter and cook a cow before getting my food here"}
{"text":"Excellent food, tamales fave
Excellent service, always friendly and take time to explain unique items
Great atmosphere, warm and open
Love their guac
Fabulous margaritas"}
{"text":"Great experiences everytime I have eaten at El Carcinero, tonight I had the pleasure of talking with owner Eric Williams which was amazing to see the face of the company there working alongside all the staff and serving customers! Food was amazing as usual and had that unique flavor I have come to expect. Also service was top notch! Will be back again soon to either El Carcinero or Momocho!"}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite Mexican restaurant in Ohio. Try the tinga chicken and goat cheese guac! Tasty and not overly stuffing. The sofritos green beans are also good (but a little oily). One downside to this place is that they are not as fast at turning tables as other restaurants in the area, so you could end up with quite a wait depending on when you go."}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  My group started early at the bar for happy hour and enjoyed $2 Modelo Especials and the $5 wild boar nachos.  $2 beers are a great deal and the wild boar nachos were incredible - they had smoked gouda, wild boar, and jalepeno mustard crema.  

For dinner I had the wild boar tamales with a fried egg on top.  I have to admit I had never had tamales before but these were great!  The portions are pretty big as well.  The mole and green salsa had great flavor.  

Our server was very helpful and educated us on the finer points of the menu.  The interior is well decorated.  Will come back."}
{"text":"Maybe I'm crazy or my expectations were too high, but if I had to pick one word for El Carnicero it'd probably be...\"meh\". After hearing rave reviews for as long as the restaurant has been open, I finally made my way there.
I figured I'd go during happy hour and sample the wild boar nachos and see what other deals they had going on. Honestly, the happy hour was kind of pointless. Outside of the nachos, it was $1 off the regular margarita and a couple little discounts on a bottle or two of beer. It just didn't really seem worth sitting at the bar for but whatever, a deal is a deal, even if there aren't many of them. Since I wanted a pineapple margarita, it was full price, and it was pretty darn good. And the nachos? A return trip will be made just for those. If I hadn't had the nachos, I would have been so supremely disappointed in my experience.
I got the shrimp taquitos. They were just bland. Even with the sauces they gave, there was no flavor. And I hated the tortillas. They were so mealy and honestly just felt gross in my mouth. My boyfriend had the fish taquitos (mahi mahi, I think?) and he felt the same. It was all just so blah. Maybe I expected way too much, but I don't see a reason to go back to get any of the regular menu food. The best I can say is that even though they were a little pricey, we both had leftovers...although we may have just filled up on a lot of nachos.
As for the service, we were at the bar, and while I understand the bartender is not a server and has a lot of people to deal with, that was slightly below par as well. It took her forever to take our orders or refill drinks. She also had to apologize for how long our food was taking in the kitchen. 
Summary: I'll go back and eat nachos, MAYBE try tamales, but the taquitos were a no-go for me, and I'm not in a hurry for a return trip."}
{"text":"The papas fritas with chimichurri is the best! Pair that with the guacamole and goat cheese and you are in heaven. I've been to El Carnicero 3 times now and I've always left satisfied. On my first and second visit I had the \"chancho | adobo + citrus braised wild boar\" and the third time I had the \"el pato | slow cooked duck leg confit.\" The slow cooked duck was rich and juicy...it literally melts in your mouth. I also had a Blood Orange Margarita and a tequila cocktail that were yummy.

I highly recommend this place for the atmosphere, food, and good time."}
{"text":"We went there last night for the first time. Won't be back for sure. First mexican restaurant I had to pay for the salsa. Which wasn't very good at all. The menu was rediculous to read. The service was terrible, had to ask 3 times for partially stale chip refills while we waited over an hour for food. Our bartender/server was overwhelmed. Not sure why we had to ask someone to help her out with our table of 9. Needless to say i will stick with my local mexican restaraunts from now on"}
{"text":"Went for dinner. Pretty much the same as momocho. Got the goat cheese gauc, huge portion and will defiantly get again! Got the wild boar taquitos which you can split as well. Got the trio margarita sampler. Red pepper, rooster claw (spicy mango) and cucumber. Fav was the rooster claw, but I love spicy! Way bigger than momocho which is nice cause you're able to get a table with no wait. Go you'll love it!"}
{"text":"Same great food as Momomocho.  Very good service.  But, this place is LOUD!  I mean really LOUD!  They need to do something about the volume level.

I would say 5 stars based on food & service.  But, the disturbing level of sound is so great that I took a star away."}
{"text":"I love it! I love everything, their pineapple guacamole is delicious, their cucumber margarita and the spicy mango margarita are the best. Good service"}
{"text":"We went on a Wednesday for happy hour.  Ordered the wild boar nachos, goat cheese guacamole and margaritas.  The food we first ordered was great.  I was a little confused if the flavored margaritas were freshly made since they were poured out of a jug, meaning they weren't doctored up or infused with the restaurants own homemade syrups (hibiscus, cucumber etc....)  I would have thought being a more specialized, cooler restaurant, they would take pride in making all their flavors in house, and who knows maybe they do but then place them in the jugs for easy pouring behind the bar seems very generic.  I also asked about their sangria since it's one of my favorite summer drinks but I was told that the sangria was from a bottle and not homemade.  I would have at least thought they would use a base sangria and then throw their own spin on it by adding some triple sec, fresh squeezed oranges and limes,fresh fruit etc... but it's just poured over ice.  There's a place in Avon Lake called Las Cazuelas where they make their sangria in front of you at the bar and it's amazing, I was hoping for a similar experience at El C.  We also ordered the steak tacos which were fair but not amazing.  They were build your own but barely came with any onions or peppers and some fresh cut cilantro on the side would have been great as well.  
Overall I did like El C, but I went in there with the expectations of more handmade, crafty drinks/cocktails and that just didn't seem to be the outcome.

This is now an edited portion of the review I just posted a few hours ago.  Eric from El C just responded and they do in fact use many fresh ingredients and make their margaritas home made so I wanted to clarify that for anyone reading this.  They just make big batches of it, hence the jugs.  I am adding an extra star now for the great customer service response and the fact that they are homemade."}
{"text":"I've been here several of times!! I love the variety of flavors for margaritas! The service is awesome every time. I have tried all of their guacamoles and they were all delicious  I've tried a lot of dishes but I am so sad that they took the lamb fajitas off the menu. It was the best! I did wish they had later hours. But thAnks for having a cool spot to hang and drink a margarita!"}
{"text":"All of the servers have way cooler tattoos than I do. Additonally the food is exceptional."}
{"text":"Planned a surprise birthday party for a friend in Lakewood, from western New York! The event coordinator, Cristy was phenomenal, especially from far away! She was extremely accommodating to our desires, budget, etc. The staff was additionally great. The hostess played up the surprise, the bartender, Dane was perfect; laid back, efficient and fun to be around! The atmosphere was also cool, not too loud, and the food had just the right twist and touch to make unique, not to mention delicious. I would highly recommend the restaurant - FIVE STARS!"}
{"text":"The portions are large and the margaritas are dynomite! Go for the guacamole with goat cheese... YUM-O!"}
{"text":"This place is the worst. The food was good, but we waited over two hours for seating. The staff made no effort, and the drinks were ridiculously overpriced. The bartenders charge more than the advertised price for the drinks. They also pocketed our change. I would not recommend this place to anyone. The atmosphere was cool, and the decorations were pretty sweet; but this business was a sh*t show and after they nearly made the birthday girl cry I can say I'm never ever going back."}
{"text":"Do not miss the cucumber margarita with chili lime salt!  Delicious taquitos and guac."}
{"text":"The sampler might seem a bit pricey but if you order it you'll know why. It is absolutely worth it. One with crab was my favorite. Food was great and margaritas were fantastic.  Saves me the trip to Momocho from Lakewood. Keep up the great food and service."}
{"text":"I originally gave this place 3 stars because they had the smallest water glasses on the planet  but since they have changed to larger glasses 5 stars! Interesting interior, attentive service, delicious food. I ordered the cheese and poblano tamales and really enjoyed my meal. Amazing sauces, I want to lick my plate every time! Get the guac with goat cheese. you will be transported to heaven."}
{"text":"The goat cheese guacamole was great. My pork taq? (little taco?) I've never had chitlens before but I think I did that Saturday. Let's just say there was an after taste in my pork dish,but I ate it all. Won't be getting any pork dishes if I ever go back. I make a mean guacamole but their goat cheese guac beats my best made !"}
{"text":"Food was decent but not quite worth the wait or the somewhat overpriced drinks (margaritas especially) when it's not happy hour.  I was also surprised that this was one of the first mexican restaurants I've been to that doesn't provide chips and salsa from the start... possibly that's how they entice you to buy the overpriced guacamole.  The food and drink tends to come pretty darn quick but that's assuming you can get acknowledgement from a staff member to take your order in the first place though.  I may give it another shot to see if the service stays more consistent next time."}
{"text":"Drinks are great but pricey and a bit weak. Food is delicious but your bill can add up crazy fast at this place. Two people for $80 with only 3 drinks?!?"}
{"text":"Happy Hour! What more can I say? We had the margaritas and Wild boar nachos! Delicious! We sat at the large bar and enjoyed seeing what everyone was ordering. The short ribs tamales were great and the pork belly taquitos were amazing. Look forward to returning."}
{"text":"This is mine and my husband's favorite restaurant in the Cleveland area. I think we have tried everything on the menu at least once and still haven't found anything we don't like. 

The guac and margarita samplers are a must for us and the tamales and tacos are big enough to share but if you are hungry enough, can definitely be finished on your own. 

All the food seems fresh and well prepared. The service is great. They also have longer table to accommodate larger parties. We have had to wait a few times for a table but on busier nights it was still easy to get a margarita from the bar and hang out till the table was ready."}
{"text":"Great food, friendly staff, unique decor. A perfect place to try some unique mexican cuisine. This place makes cozumel look like taco bell. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Love this place. Almost always the right level of busy. Food is just terrific - we love the guacamole selection, and the machaca beef is amazing. Everything is quality and exceedingly fresh. I could eat the salsa verde with a spoon! Drinks are good too - love the chili-lime rim. Mmm."}
{"text":"Food here is innovative and fresh. Happy hour specials on food and margaritas are amazing for the high quality of both. The bar is inviting and the atmosphere takes you to a whole nother place."}
{"text":"Easily my favorite restaurant in Lakewood. The food is excellent with service to match. The margaritas are exceptional. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I love this place!! Pitchers of cucumber margarita and the best mole on the west side!! Get the short rib tamales!"}
{"text":"The Menu at El Carnicero has an unusual postscript, it states that they \"only serve people who are happy to be {there}.\" I can only interpret that as meaning that you have to put up with whatever bull-hucky they throw your way or get the flip out. Unfortunately there is more than a little bull-hucky to be dealt with.

El Carnicero doesn't take reservations so when we arrived at 6pm we were told there would be a 45 minute wait for our party of 4. It was early and the bar looked comfy so we decided to wait. After 45 minutes we were told it would be 15 minutes ,every 15 minutes until finally at 7:55 we were seated. Then we waited another 10 minutes for our server to turn up and then we waited another 25 minutes for our drinks to come out. The food at least was quick to appear.

Even with slow service we spent less than half as much time actually at our table as we did waiting for it.

TL:DR Ultimately the food was good but not exceptional, the service was friendly but poor and the attitude of the establishment contemptible. We won't be back."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the charred tomato salsa. The goat cheese guac was just blah. Nothing amazing about it until I added some of the house habanero sauce to it. Then it was delish, just needed something! hubby and I shared the wild Boar tamale and the butchers steak taquitos. No joke, that Wild Boat tamale may be THE most delicious thing I have ever eaten! I will be back just for that!! The steak taquitos were delicious as well, but the clear star of our meal was the boar."}
{"text":"Happy hour Modelo!! Wild boar nachos and queso, some of the best I have ever had. Love the atmosphere . Really fun place for appetizers."}
{"text":"It's no secret that guac is my favorite food ever, but I am appreciative that the waiter here talked me out of ordering the guacamole sampler as an entree for myself.  I did get an order of the goat cheese guac, which was so rich and delicious, but couldn't even finish it because it was such a large portion.  Apparently the sampler is 3 full sized portions.  The corn side dish and strawberry rhubarb margarita are also very good."}
{"text":"I recently had a phenomenal experience here! I wanted to give a special thanks to the staff for an incredible meal and world class service! Cheers!"}
{"text":"Having visited el Carnicero twice now, I can get down to reviewing it. Both times I had a great experience, and I must say I prefer this restaurant to Momocho for a few reasons.

Reason #1: Space. El Carnicero is HUGE, and has a sprawling, circle-through-two-rooms bar, which I love. There are plenty of places to dine in here.

Reason #2: Service. I find that the staff at el Carnicero, from the host/hostess station to the bartenders to the wait staff, are a ton more pleasant than at the Ohio City counterpart.

Now, onto the food. I'm assuming it's the same in both locations. But let me tell YOU! The wild boar nachos ($5 at happy hour) are a joy to behold. We would have ordered another one if we could have done it without looking like total pigs.

I've tried  a fair share of tamales (both vegetarian and overflowing with meat) and they are amazing. And the drinks are great, as usual. Most people try the margaritas at Momocho/el Carnicero, and for good reason, but I also need to recommend the Sangria, which is also $5/glass during happy hour.

Just delicious. You know it's good when I practically have to roll out of there. The combination of excellent service and \"heart attack with a bit of class\" food will bring me back again."}
{"text":"I'm not sure how this place has 4 stars. Their margaritas taste like mellow yellow (try using real lime juice). Service was non existent even with the host seating us. The couple next to us left because no one helped them. Sure enough, we did as well 15 minutes later. Maybe I'm missing something but there are a few other places near by I'd recommend over this spot. Sorry guys!"}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best Mexican restaurants around.  This is one of our family's favorites. Get the guac sampler, but be warned- this stuff is addictive and will put you in such a food haze, that you'll forget to leave room for the entrees. Try the margarita sampler and share amongst friends. The service here is always on point (don't understand the reviews talking about bad service). I don't care where you live, get in the car because this place is worth the drive."}
{"text":"I'm usually not into Mexican cuisine at all but I must say, of all the places in Cleveland that I  have been to, I really think the quality of food here is exceptional (the guac, homemade tortilla chips, tamale, brussel sprouts, etc.). The chicken is super tender in the tamale dish.  They have an awesome Margarita flight of ginger/pear, pomegranate, spicy mango, and othes to choose from.  Authentic, flavorful, high quality and delicious! There is usually a wait BTW so plan on it!  If you want fast and cheap mexican you may want to go elsewhere and not complain about prices here."}
{"text":"I was excited to check out El Carnicero because I have been to Momocho and when I heard a sister restaurant was opening right down the street from me I had to go!  

We came in around 6 this past Friday and it was pretty full but we got seated right away.  The service was great.  Very attentive and the owner spoke with us for about 15 minutes.  It was great to hear his background and how he got started with Happy Dog and Momocho.  

We ordered the goat cheese guacamole which as always is divine (same as Momocho).  Nothing ever compares.  Chips were warm and pefectly crisp.  3 of us ordered Tamales including the costilla | dos equis braised beef short ribs and al pastor | adobo + citrus braised pork.  The other two in my party ordered the Taquitos including tinga | sixteen spiced chicken al carbon and the pescado | horseradish-chile glazeado salmon.  Everyone enjoyed the fresh tender meat or fish along with the spices and sauces to accompany each dish.  

The space is much larger than Momocho with is nice and it has a large wrap around bar with another in the other part of the restaurant.  A lot of people were just at the bar enjoying drinks so I could see myself just stopping in there for a drink sometime too.

All in all I'm glad Eric decided to open another great restaurant and appreciated his hospitality when we dined there.  Just another great place added to the rise of this city.

Cleveland that I love."}
{"text":"My favorite fish dinner lent special ever!!! Had the fish special which included 3 pieces of fresh perch fried lightly, french fries with a drizzled green cheese sauce ( delicious). There was plenty. I also had the margarita special on the clevelandeats. Com app. $10.00 instead of $15. Would definitely go again."}
{"text":"Another solid Eric Williams offering!  We went on a Saturday and ate off the brunch and lunch menus.  I had the Ranchos Huevos and they were truly outstanding and filling. Wife had a hash dish that she also loved.  Girls ate two different kinds of tacos and both said they were very good.

Bar and restaurant spaces were \"hand crafted\" by Eric, including the re-use of wooden pallets used to carry avocados.  His eclectic decorating style fits the space very nicely.

Will definitely return."}
{"text":"I really like this place because: (1) the margaritas (blood orange, hibiscus, etc.); (2) AL PASTOR TAMALE; and (3) guacamole. 

A meal with guacamole (or whatever), cocktails and entrees can be pretty costly, which is why the 4 stars."}
{"text":"Had dinner at El Carnicero last night. We didn't have to wait for a table even though we had 8 people in our party and did not have a reservation. Our server paid individual attention to every single person and the food was impeccable. My favorites: spicy mango margarita and goat cheese guacamole"}
{"text":"If you are extremely gluten sensitive, be aware the tortilla chips and papas fritas are fried in the same oil as the empanadas. The tamales are magnificent, but only the mole pipian (green) is GF. Talk to your server, and you can have a terrific meal sans gluten."}
{"text":"I'm from California and am constantly homesick for avocados--so great to enter this guacamole heaven!!

You must try the guacamole sampler, in which you're given three different types of guacamole. We had the goat cheese guac, the crab guac, and the sesame seed guac. The sesame seed salsa (very unique) also deserves a shoutout. 

I was so full on chips and guac that I wasn't able to do my wild boar tamale justice, but it was very tasty! Wild boar is very gamey, and the restaurant sources it from Texas. Much to my disappointment, \"wild boar\" does not mean that someone hunted a boar in the wild...it's a species of boar that's raised on a farm.

Overall, the food I had here was unique and tasty. Definitely recommend a visit, and be sure to try the habanero sauce...it'll blow your head off!"}
{"text":"My wife and I don't get out to eat much lately (read: we're broke), so when we made plans a few days ago to check out El Carnicero, there was much pomp and circumstance--mainly, me repeatedly texting my wife from work and saying \"I can't f*cking wait to eat those tamales.\"  As recent transplants from Nashville, we've never even been to Momocho, or Happy Dog, for that matter, so we were going purely on word of mouth and the good vibes we got from walking by the place on our way to Midtown Booths the other day.  Thankfully, the good juju was matched by great food, great drinks, great service, and reasonable prices.

Walking in, I was a bit surprised to find the place largely empty, the day being Friday and the time being Happy Hour and the restaurant being the two-week-old brainchild of a Cleveland celebrity chef.  No complaints here, though.  My wife and I quickly found a seat at the bar and ordered our drinks--a $2 Modelo for her, and a $5 Margarita Tradicional for myself.  They premix the margaritas and pour them out of plastic jugs, which I guess might offend a seasoned margarita aficionado (I'll have to test this theory on my mother), but it tasted great and was drinkable enough for me to order a second one with a few Happy Minutes to spare.  Our bartender was friendly, helpful, not too pushy, and reminiscent of Jonah Hill in the best way.  He asked if we'd like to start with the $5 wild boar nachos--the happy hour special--but having perused (or obsessed over)  the menu at home, we couldn't not order the slightly more expensive goat cheese guacamole.  It came out a few minutes later, creamy as all get out, with still-warm tortilla chips that blew the back of my head right off.  All hyperbole aside, this was a chip 'n' dip for the ages.

Seeing that we were not about to be slowed down, the bartender wisely assumed we would be ordering entrees, and we proceeded to order the chorizo tamale (for my wife) and the duck confit tamale (for myself), each priced at about $15.  I also got a side order of the refritos (refried beans flavored with pork belly), because they were $2 and that's the cheapest you're ever going to find anything associated with pork belly.  Our entrees came out at just the right time and exactly the right temperature.  Having read an article in the Plain Dealer that these were no ordinary tamales, I was curious as to how something so defined by a limited set of ingredients (masa steamed in corn husks with a meaty filling) could be out of the ordinary, but that Plain Dealer writer told no lies.  The meaty filling is served on top of the masa, rather than stuffed inside of it, and a different sauce tops each of the halves--salsa on one side, mole on the other.  My duck confit was as tender and succulent as I've ever had, and the masa was far more pleasing on a flavor and texture level than anything I've had elsewhere.  My wife's chorizo was also excellent.  The refritos were the only remotely disappointing part of the meal, having been seasoned a little too aggressively with cumin, but I still managed to scarf them down no problem.  

I topped off the meal with a Sol, which may be my new favorite Mexican import, and asked for the check.  The damage was $60, which was perhaps a bit more than I was planning on spending, but it was totally worth it, and my wife and I have already started rationalizing our next trip back (\"We can split an entree and get the wild boar nachos instead of the guac!\")  Of course, we both know that'll never happen, and frankly, we don't care.  I'll get a second job if it means more of those tamales."}
{"text":"Two words:  Momocho west

Yep, I would say 95% of the menu here is identical to Momocho in Ohio City.  It makes sense because it is the same owner.  There are a few different things on the menu...creamed corn being one of them.  I was hoping to see the Sofrito green beans but no such luck...different kind of beans.  I am a HUGE Momocho fan so I loved El Carnicero.  The salsa verde is outstanding.  You cannot go wrong with the machaca (coffee braised brisket) or tinga (16-spiced chicken).  Bar service was good.  Much, much bigger space than Momocho witha great atmosphere, solid food with big, bold flavors, and a fun time.  Park in the adjacent lot or in a metered spot."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and the drinks are great. The staff is really good and explaining the menu. We got the goat cheese and the salmon guacamole both were amazing. I got the duck tamales, the dish was good but I think this style of Mexican just isn't really my thing. Everyone at our table loved their dishes."}
{"text":"Very friendly, fast service and quality, fresh-tasting food. 

We probably arrived here at 6 and paid the check at 6:35. Very well organized operation. 

Excellent guacamole and salsa. We had the crab and corn guacamole and the grapefruit/pineapple/haba√±ero salsa. Uuuuuuuh... So good with the fresh chips. 

The al pastor taquitos were very good. I know they braise the meat. That's ok. The taste is tangy, rich and savory. But I bet if they got a spit and grilled this the classic way they would blow people away. 

The cucumber margarita is the lady's favorite drink around. It is good."}
{"text":"The wild boar nachos are the best nachos I've ever had anywhere. Tamales are excellent... Any of the choices are good... I had the chorizo with an egg.  The sides are delicious too... We shared the corn, the refried beans and Brussels sprouts. The sprouts were salty so we sent them back but overall the meal was delicious and a good value for the  portions. Go during happy hour."}
{"text":"Just look at all the posted pictures here and that should be enough to convince you to check it out. I was getting sick of that whole chain restaurant identical Mexican menu thing going on with the local El Jalapenos and Si Senor. 

Their guac is great. Queso dip is meh. Margaritas are worth it! If you like Mexican and are looking for a new place, this is it."}
{"text":"Wanted to mention I revisited El Carcinero and took my bother and sister in law so they can understand the charm that is dining in Lakewood. Less chains, more mom and pops, local businesses with great quality. They loved the various exotic meat selections. Food was great again. They also let us try on the masks. So much mun! Waiter was great as well."}
{"text":"When I learned \"El Carnicero\" is how you say \"The Butcher\" in Spanish, I couldn't believe it. I ain't NEVER recommended no butcher before - I'm a piggie piggie piggie, can't you see?! But this place is truly somethin' great. I left the drugs alone, took the thugs along with me to Lakehood on a Saturday night.

Me and my crew were MAD hungry when we finally got to the 216. I was with my Bakewood crew, some real potbelly pigs, if ya catch my drift. Smokin funk by the boxes, all cravin' chips and guac is why, when they told us they don't do reservations and that we be lookin' at an hour before we'd be seated, we 'bout squealed, yo!

I can't skip meals like when I was younger, suckin' on some chiclets just to stop my effin' hunger. But when you realize how much there is to do on Detroit, the whole \"no reservations\" thing here doesn't really seem that bad. At the time, I was screamin' but now, I'm just dreamin' - dreamin' about 'dat goat cheese guac, yo. 

El Carn's got some of the dankest dip around, straight up. We ripped monster hits off that bowl of guac until they brought us our entrees. I still don't have a clue what \"confit\" means, but even this pig's pallet could respect the mad game the duck tamale I ordered was bringin'. It's all I could think about the next day! Quack is wack. 

When I die, eff it - I wanna go to El...
Carnicero! It ain't hard to freakin' tell...
that El Carn is straight up crushin' it, down to the smallest details. Like, check this out - they give you these \"El Carnicero\" postcards when you're done piggin' out and, if you fill it out and just leave it on the table, they'll mail it for you the next day! I ain't playin'! Dope marketing move, no doubt, but more importantly, dope restaurant experience. This place is da mas enfermo, yo! Great service, from El Carn to el barn. Just another thing that made me go wee wee wee all the way home. 'Cause I didn't ever wanna' leave!

Piggie Smalls is 'da illest. And thanks to the butcher, I'm 'da fillest now, too.

Piggie smalls out."}
{"text":"We stopped in here on a Saturday looking for a late lunch - this place did not disappoint! We started off with the guacamole with goat cheese. If you're at all skeptical, don't be. It's amazing. Our entrees were both fantastic - I highly recommend the blue corn enchiladas off the brunch menu. We've come back here for their happy hour margaritas, too. All in all, a very fun place to hang out in Lakewood!"}
{"text":"This is one of my husbands and my favorite spots. We love the chips, guac, salsa and the tinga. I had my husbands 30th surprise birthday party here and I was very impressed! The girl who coordinated the Party was so responsive and helpful I really didn't have to worry about a thing. We had the one whole side of the restaurant to ourselves with our own private bar. We had a guac and salsa bar, different tacos and some empanadas. I would plan another party there in a heart beat!!!! The best part was no
Clean up for me! I got to show up have my party and leave! They let us bring in our own desserts and we did a cash Bar. Everyone loved it!! We've never had a bad meal there. We love momocho too but it's further for us and a little harder to get into on short notice! Both places are A+ !"}
{"text":"My husband and I had date night. We chose Mexican. Great choice. The quacomoles were awesome. The margaritas were fabulous and the pork belly just delicious. Definitely will be back with the rest of the family."}
{"text":"Fun place, food is really good. a little pricey but the \"worst seat in the house\" spot gets you 15% off your food. That is fun! Love taking out of towners here. Margaritas are yummy too. I have the mahi mahi and that was amazing. I have had some other stuff there too, all good. The reason for the 4 stars is the price. Atmosphere and food are really good, just could be a little bit less expensive."}
{"text":"This place is excellent if you are wanting quality Mexican food that doesn't come to your table 5 seconds after ordering.  

They have an excellent selection and I am never disappointed when trying something new here. Their drinks are top notch and creative.

Go during brunch and try to huevos rancheros...Amazeballs."}
{"text":"As a transplanted Texan, this isn't the place to get my Tex Mex fix, but that isn't a fair judgement. The food is interesting with good flavors, but too \"deconstructed\" for my taste. Also, anyone from Texas (or familiar with most Mexican restaurants) is a little put off by paying for EVERYTHING a la carte; chips, salsa, beans, rice - everything is priced separately and it adds up. So when you are used to paying $20 for a very filling meal with drinks and everything, it is hard to cough up twice as much or even more. The staples of Mexican food are very cheap items - and I'm vegetarian, so I'm not talking about meat. All that said, the food is good and I would probably go more often, but it is also always crazy busy and very loud. You can almost always get a place at one of their bars, as they have a couple, so if you like that set up, or at least don't mind it, you should be good. For my taste and for the prices they are charging, I want something more than the pub atmosphere."}
{"text":"This is a 10 minute walk from my house so I decided to take some out of town friends here so they could view my area on foot. Everything we ordered was excellent. I usually don't drink but the Margarita menu was calling out to me, I went with a sampler and loved the cucumber, regular & spicy mango options. Amazing! 

I had a bunch of other items we shared but for dinner I ordered a brisket tamale that was also amazing. This will be a regular staple for me now that I live close by. Service & atmosphere were both in top form as well."}
{"text":"Good day! It's December 13th and it's almost 60 outside? So. How can you just dismiss global warming?? Amirite? Ok. Good guacamole here. Not literally, 'guacamole' is a word I use for atmosphere. Ironically I did get guac with the chips though! It rocked!!

The breakfast dishes looked really good. I didn't eat anything but I did watch my friends eat their food while I drank my coffee and smiled. Also, the service rocked!!

The Java was very tasty. They have brown sugar built into the drink. This isn't a metaphor for love from a dark skinned woman, so get your freaking head out of the goiter (as they say). 

I do recommend! Yep :)"}
{"text":"Don't come here with kids. We have a 1 1/2 year old who did not make a peep. We were told we can only have a high table even though there were at least 4 regular open tables in the restaurant. When I asked why we couldn't get an open regular table to get a high chair for my baby, the hostess rolled her eyes at me and explained again that she would only have a high table for us. The big sign at the hostess desk should say \"kids not welcome\" instead of \"looking for a reservation, wrong place\". Wont go back without kids!"}
{"text":"My fam√≠lia would kill me for going to a restaurant like El C, but I can't knock Lakewood for being different and putting a personal twist on Mexican cuisine. I love Mexican food. It's flavorful, it's delicious, it accounts for most food groups in a bite, and it's comfort food me. 

At El Carnicero, it's acceptable to eat just dip and guacamole as a meal. I really enjoyed the goat cheese guacamole and the sikil pak is fantastic! Definitely should order the sikil pak. Another solid choice is the red pepper margarita, but I think everyone is already aware of the amazing margaritas being served. I ordered the Al Pastor tamales for dinner. Thought it was good. Very flavorful, filling. Strangely tasted hints of coffee. Probably order a duck confit dish next time.

It's true... El C is pretty expensive, but oh well, sometimes you just gotta treat yo self."}
{"text":"Amazing. Get the coffee braised pork. And the goat cheese guacamole. And every margarita they offer. You will not be disappointed. You're welcome."}
{"text":"I have always had great service, but I don't always know what I'm ordering. Margarita flights are fun. Huevos rancheros-- or ranch eggs-- are delightful. This place is totally awesome if you're willing to take a step out of your comfort zone."}
{"text":"Went there with friends when it first opened and it was great. Recently went this past weekend with my fiance and was told 30-40 minutes reasonable for a weekend, so we grabbed a drink at the bar and ordered the salsa flight. Both were very good and we were looking forward to the meal. After an hour we were told it would be another 15 minutes. After the 25 minutes it took us to cash out at the bar, the table ahead of us was told it would be around 30 minutes so we left. Long story short, we spent around 2 hours to not be seated and spend 25$ on chips/salsa and a margarita."}
{"text":"This place works miracles. I went in yesterday (in a rather frazzled state) after driving around for about an hour looking for good Mexican food to take to a friend.  It was really important for me to find the right menu options because my friend had a specific request and really needed the pick-me-up. Not only did they work with me to modify the menu options to best fit what my friend had requested, they also treated me to a beer and tossed in some complimentary churros for good measure. It meant so much that they went the extra mile to meet my needs and then went above and beyond. AND, the food was delicious. Definitely a customer for life!"}
{"text":"I have trouble giving this restaurant more than 4 stars primarily because I just find it overpriced. That said, the food was really excellent, just not enough food or high enough seeming in quality for the price tag. The restaurant has a casual feel and a good menu. Helpful staff, tasty drinks and fair happy hour specials (but not amazing). The flavors in my dinner were really great and it's a very unique menu. I also really like the special guacamole but again, it's quite expensive. I will go back eventually but really can't make it here that often and don't think it's 100% worth splurging on, personally. Cool concept though and well executed food!"}
{"text":"Had to try El Carnicero after seeing Mamocho on triple D many years ago. Visited during happy hour, sat at the bar and had a few of the very tasty $5 margaritas. Ordered the smoked trout/bacon guacamole and the chorizo and queso dish. Guacamole was unique-smoky, creamy and delicious. Made some mini tacos with the corn tortillas that came with the chorizo dish. Decided to order the pulled pork nachos. Goodly sized portion for a happy hour special. Had a delicious cheese sauce that complimented the pork. The cheese sauce was a little loose, so the bottom of the nacho basket had tons of sauce, hence the tortilla chips were soaked, while the top chips were pretty bare. All said, the service was great, food unique and delicious and prices reasonable."}
{"text":"I go here every so often as I live just down the road. A couple things stick out in my mind that could be done better. I go for drinks, though, so can't speak of table service or food at all

1. Their margaritas (and other drinks) are served out of large plastic jugs, premixed. This could be okay for table service, but is off putting for someone getting served next to the bar or within eyeshot 

2. The bartender we have had more than once has been rude every time I've gotten served by him

Good atmosphere, though, and a nice spicy michelada, something you can't find many places in Cleveland. Even with the issues this place is better for a drink than most of the surrounding bars/restaurants"}
{"text":"I have been dreaming of the Machaca (also available at Momocho) ever since I heard about. It combines two of my great food loves: brisket and coffee. I finally made my way to El Carnicero to try it. Holy yum! The brisket was tender, moist and extremely flavorful. Brisket nirvana. I got the taquitos, served with salsa verde and traditional guac. I am not a huge guac fan, but this was delicious and I seriously cannot wait to go back for more.
I was also eager to try the ginger margarita, but in the spirit of diversity, I went for the sampler. I picked the ginger and the cucumber, leaving the third choice to our friendly bartender. He selected the blood orange. They were all amazing! The cucumber in particular was so refreshing. I think it will be my go to for the rest of the summer.
Did I mention they have a Saturday Happy Hour? I didn't even know this was a thing but I couldn't be happier! 
My dining partner has a variety of food allergies/sensitivities, and El Carnicero definitely earned a fifth star for being very accommodating. My friend was able to customize her order and enjoy a delicious and stress-free meal."}
{"text":"I like the margarita flights that you can get here. The food is also pretty good."}
{"text":"If this is Mod Mex, count me in! Seems like there are a lot of places calling themselves mod mex popping up lately, but I doubt they can do the quality flavors and ingredients this place does at this this price point. The flavor explosions that El Carnicero bring keep me coming back for more. I can barely get past the machaca brisket taquitoes and fundido cheese dip to try anything else, but after bringing my visiting relatives here and trying their pork tamale dish, I'll be giving that a try next time, another out of this world flavor invasion on my palette. 
Not to mention the fun atmosphere that surrounds you! You almost feel as if you attending a Lucha  libre event when you dine here! The masks, the awesome branding, the warmth. In a way, it is an event. Your tastebuds versus the El Carnicero flavors. You will submit!"}
{"text":"I love Momocho, so it is nice to have this place so close to home!

The initial welcome was fantastic. The inside looks so beautiful, and much larger than I expected. There are two main rooms, a semi-private party room, and a Tequileria (open Friday thru Sunday after 6pm I believe?). We had a call ahead seating arrangement made for the semi-private party room. Gorgeous. Our server was so incredibly friendly and perfectly prompt about everything. Great service!

Everyone should know going in, it will not be a cheap night. But you are not getting just any old food and drink. Drinks are $5-$10 but the margaritas are made to perfection; they are worth every penny. Same idea with the food menu you are spending between $10 and $15 but everything on the menu is made with outstanding quality. You definitely get what you pay for.


Also, some previous posts mentioned they do not split checks. This policy has been amended, and they are actually very accommodating to large groups. Kudos to them for listening to their client base and making necessary adjustments. Just call ahead! It makes everyone's life so much easier.  I will definitely be going back. Wonderful experience!"}
{"text":"Ambiance: 4. Momocho's younger, less-experienced sister sits well-positioned in the middle of Lakewood and with all the Mexican-wrestling-themed paraphernalia we've come to love at Momocho.  However, the restaurant is massive in comparison, with several dining rooms, bar areas and side rooms for larger parties.  This is not an intimate dining spot.

Cost: 3. Carnicero is basically the same pricing as Momocho, which is what I now consider modestly overpriced by Cleveland standards.  Strong customer service, atmosphere, and limited high-quality Mexican options make it palatable.

Food Quality: 4. Tequila/Margarita offerings get a five (pretty much anything I've ever heard of is one the menu, at least 20+ offerings between the major tequilas). Guacamole still gets a five - get a trio sampler, worth the price even with two people.  My recommendation are crab and pineapple outside of traditional.  Versus Momocho, who offered larger unique main dishes, Carnicero sticks with Tamales (keeping the coveted short rib tamales that were great at Momocho) and tacos (most are good, but avoid the chicken, generally dry).

Service: 5. Service great similar to its sister restaurant, , wait staff always watches your drink situation (both booze and water) and they are helpful on recommendations even after going a few times of new things to try.

When to return: Walk in (no reservations).  Mexican craving.  Happy hour (4-7, EVERYDAY).  Larger groups that normally couldn't do Momocho."}
{"text":"Just love this place never disappoints! Everything is good and flavorful!Happy hour is a must and they have$5.00 tequila Tuesday!!!! You Must have the goat cheese guacamole!!! So good!"}
{"text":"Spin-offs don't usually work. For every  \"Frasier\" there are a hundred \"Three's a Crowd\" (Hey, look it up). But I'm happy to say that El Carnicero is a nice spin-off on Momocho.

And that's mostly because the menu is almost the same as the excellent Ohio City restaurant. It looks like there might be a couple fewer taquitos than at Momocho but everything else seems to be at this Lakewood eatery. Plus, they have multiple options for tamales

The margaritas ($8 to $8.50) were nicely balanced between the bitterness of the tequila and the tartness of the mixes. And, like Momocho, you get 8 flavors to choose from in addition to Traditional.

If you aren't big into spice, like my wife, then I'd recommend the pineapple/jicama salsa ($2.50) to go with the crisp, non-greasy chips. Otherwise you have multiple options for salsa ($2.50) and guacamole ($7-$8.50).

For our main courses, we took advantage of the expanded tamale options. I had the coffee/ancho braised beef brisket ($14.50) and enjoyed mixing the blunt, slow-build heat of the brown sauce on one side of the plate with the tart green sauce on the other. The masa corn bread added a nice soft texture to go with the chewiness of the brisket.

Jeannene had the wild boar tamale ($14.50), which was presented similarly though the sauce on this plate was not as spicy while the pork was more moist. 

The differences in the two restaurants are more non-food releated. As far as ambiance, it is more clean-cut with only some framed pictures of masked wrestlers to remind diners of the quirkiness of Momocho. Comparing the two is like comparing the new Melt locations to the original. But El Carnicero is huge so you don't have to worry about making a reservation two weeks in advance.

And Carnicero seems to have an intriguing breakfast menu that we will have to back for."}
{"text":"Always delicious! Never been let down! This is our fourth or fifth time here and the food is exceptional and the service is exceptional. Our whole family loves this place. Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"Don't mean to rant, but this is Momocho II.  Similar food, drinks and decor (\"Nacho Libre\"masks, dark ambiance). The food is great. I ordered the Hongo tamale, made from mushroom and zucchini, and topped with zesty mole sauce. My cucumber margarita was quite refreshing, but not worth the $8.  

Although the food and drinks were overall pretty great, El Carnicero will not split checks for customers, which made it extremely difficult for my table of 7 upon check out. For such a trendy, hip place, this archaic method of payment was really surprising. However, although the waitress graciously agreed to split the check because they were \"slow\" that night, it took an additional 45 minutes to complete this process. We were never notified of their policy on splitting checks prior to ordering. We never received an \"I'm sorry\" from the manager or any kind of verbalized compensation, even after asking where our waitress had been for 30 minutes with our credit cards. Overall, this was an off-putting experience that honestly turned me (and my friends) off from the visiting this establishment in the future. El Carnicero may have enticingly obscure yet good food, but it's \"foodie pretentiousness\" is annoying.  Might as well check out the commercialized Mexican joint (Cozumel) down the street for good grub and appropriate customer consideration. They split checks!"}
{"text":"I wasn't impressed. The waitstaff was impatient, the vibe was pretentious, and the food was overly complicated. Fish in guacamole? That's just wrong. It was hard to order anything because the every dish had sooooo many ingredients and the entire menu required an explanation."}
{"text":"Love love love this place! It's right up the street from me so I find myself there more and more often. They have an awesome happy hour and even more amazing margarita flights"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Great atmosphere. Great food. Great margaritas. I recommend the pineapple margarita. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"3.5 for the first visit. Overall, I was happy with my experience at El Carnicero. We came here for a friends' birthday party. They don't take reservations generally, but for a larger group of 8+, they will. We were seated in the side room with a HUGE square table and really chill, casual ambiance.

I ordered the orange/sesame/habanero guacamole to share and it was pretty good! My friends also really enjoyed the margaritas, especially the cucumber one. For the main, I was quite intrigued by their vegetarian options. I ended up with the spaghetti squash tamale and found it to be quite filling. The flavors weren't super authentic (I can't deal with the feta), but it is a modern Tex-Mex restaurant! For Midwestern palettes! My husband got the pork belly taquitos, which he really enjoyed and devoured. 

I would come back with a larger group to celebrate!"}
{"text":"This was an ordeal. We waited over an hour for a table.  The food didn't come out with any quicker than that. The staff rarely checked on us as we waited and waited and waited.  And in the end the food wasn't very good at all. Relatively bland, the portions were tiny for the price and you would think there was a global shortage of tortillas because they brought 4 of them to a table of 3 diners. We had to repeatedly ask for more, which only added to to overall time spent.  The one bright spot was the boar nachos which were tasty if somewhat inartfully prepared (2 huge chunks of meat that if we hadn't shredded it ourselves would have been gone on the first two nachos), and reasonably priced for happy hour. The music was too loud and people all around us were yelling to be heard accross their tables.  Two of our party left the place feeling a little nauseated and with throbbing headaches.  We didn't even go to the movie we had intended to see after dinner.  This place is miserable.  Wont be going back."}
{"text":"I did't see what all the fuss is about. Hipster Mexican food, trying to be a little too different. When our carne asada fries arrived it was cold, and the outside of the beef was burnt to a crisp. My girlfriend left hungry. Even the Diet Coke tasted funny. Queso dip was grainy, I guess the chips were the best part of the meal. 

Our service was incredibly slow, even though the waiter was sweaty and literally running around, slamming drinks on the table and running away before we could ask him for anything else. 

Cool atmosphere, but I'll never go back."}
{"text":"Fantastic! And to the person that said they don't split checks, don't know what happened; they do now."}
{"text":"Just had another wonderful meal at this gem of a restaurant.  Have been here and Momocho several times but took some great friends from rocky river to enjoy the experience.  No table when we walked in so we were welcomed to have a drink at the bar.  No four seats in a row so a very nice soft spoken guy asked some folks to move so we could sit together.  What great customer service( only knew he was the owner cause I'd seen him on the morning shows) talk about under cover.  Had delicious margaritas with a punch..  Then tasty trio of guacamole and the best Mexican  I've ever had.  Combination of tacos and tamales.  Very authentic but flavorful ( so many spices) with reasonable prices and great service.  You can't go wrong with this place. So happy to see that this nice small business is doing well."}
{"text":"Way over priced for what it is.  My carne asada was well done - chewy and flavorless.  The ambience is nice; service was fine. I would hope there are much better Mexican restaurants in the greater Cleveland area."}
{"text":"Had the guacamole with goat cheese and poblano - very good.
Had the citrus braised pork - the pork was dry. Braised pork should be succulent.
Disappointed . 

Might go back for just the tequila and guac."}
{"text":"First off- food was FANTASTIC! However, the service was poor at best. My husband and I sat at the bar which we usually do when we go out because we generally find bartenders more attentive. This was definitely not the case tonight. It took almost 10 minutes for the bartender to notice us and that was only after trying to wave down his attention. He was less than friendly when he did approach us. He took our drink order and dropped it off with no enthusiasm. He started to walk away when I spoke up asking for some guacamole to start. Another server dropped off the appetizer. The bartender was talking and joking around with another server and didn't come back over to us for almost 20 minutes. And again, only did because I literally stood up off the bar stool and called him over. He finally took our food order. During our wait for food my husband and I had both emptied our water glasses and our margaritas were a quarter full at best. Our food was finally delivered by the chef who was amazing! She was engaging, energetic, polite and actually cared we were there. NEVER once did the bartender come back. We had our appetizer plates and platter, dinner plates and tortilla warmers all sitting in front of us empty. For a good 20 minutes. He finally came over and asked if we wanted another margarita. WE WERE BONE DRY FOR THE ENTIRE MEAL AND NOW YOU ASK!? He didn't even clear our plates when we declined. He dropped the check faster than anything he'd done all night. We were incredibly disappointed. We've never had this bad of service anywhere we've gone. And we've been here several times and it's never been great service but it's never been HORRIBLE. Needless to say, the food was amazing, but the horrible service drove us away for good now."}
{"text":"Love this place...only wish is that they have happy hour where ever you sit instead of just the bar. 
Food is awesome as well. Looking forward to the goat cheese guac."}
{"text":"I've been to Momocho twice and maybe I just ordered the wrong things but I wasn't that impressed. But then I came here once and was hooked the food and margaritas are so good! The happy hour has good prices on the margarita and the wild boar nachos. I will always wish the salt on the rim was chili-salt whenever I drink a margarita now. The heat mixed with the cool margarita is perfect. That being said I wish they put their margaritas in margarita glasses. Maybe it's a 'twist' modern mexican thing but I like the festiveness of a margarita glass. 
The machaca taquito is where it's at. With an egg on top and a side of refritos. Papas fritas are good too!"}
{"text":"Awesome!  Staff knows the products, and can tell you about them in detail.  Fast service,  and some of the best Mexican we have had.  We were a fan of momocho as well, but the limited seating there made it more of a destination spot for us... Here we would not worry so much about getting a table.  I got the pork belly taquitos....best dish I have had in a while!  We also got the goat cheese guacamole,  and as I had told my friends I think goat cheese should be in everything!!  Nice job!  Can't wait to get back there!"}
{"text":"People have been telling me to go here for weeks so I finally decided to give it a try. 

Let's start with the atmosphere. From the outside, it looks like a hole-in-the-wall kind of place. But the inside is huge, so clean, and welcoming. We went around 8 o'clock on a Friday night and the wait was only 25 minutes. We ended up quickly finding seats at the bar and ordered margaritas while we waited. I got the pomegranate which I would for sure get again, but the next time I go I am going to get the sampler because you can try three different kinds for $15. 

Having never been there, we weren't sure what to order. Our waiter was extremely friendly and informative about everything on the menu. We ended up getting the crab and corn guac along with the gouda queso. Both were delicious and I would go back alone for the two of them. For my main dish I got the costilla tamales. Although the taste itself was delicious, I am the kind of person that likes more than just meat on my plate and that was essentially all it was, aside from small corn patties. Regardless, I will be going back to try something else because everything else was wonderful."}
{"text":"I just can't get enough of this place. Everytime I go it is fantastic. The brunch was good, basically regular menu fare plus eggs. Not mad at it at all. Their version of a bloody mary was pretty good, but the Super Chango was excellent. Habanero and pineapple? Yeah, I want that all the time. I'll be back, El Carnicero, probably over and over again."}
{"text":"If I could eat here everyday... I would!! It just dawned on me that this place opens at 4 p.m. On weekdays. The guacamole stuff with crumbled goat cheese is the best starter. I always get the Machaca/Taquitos (coffee braised brisket and you build your own adding toppings onto a warm corn tortillas), the Costilla braised short rib tamales served with amazing mole and tomatillo sauce. Amazing flavor profile!! The three margarita sampler (cucumber, pomegranate, and grapefruit) never lets me down. The Best!! The noise level is perfect and the crowd is generally relaxed which is Why I love coming here instead of Momocho."}
{"text":"Oh el carni- where do I begin? Your drinks were oh so tasty; your food was downright mouth-watering. You service- oh the service! Awesome. Friendly. Attentive. 

I'll begin with the drinks. We were there for a celebration of sorts so we started off the evening with a tequila shot. I don't remember the name of the tequila, so I apologize. It was organic and smooth as heck, though! Served with orange wedge and cinnamon. Yum! Then we ordered margaritas- habanero and mango. It was nothing short of magical. Spicy and sweet. Hot and cold. Killer. 

Then There's the snacks. Guac sampler- traditional, pineapple and goat cheese. They were all amazing but my friend had the brilliant idea of asking for bacon to be added to the goat cheese guacamole... Heaven on earth. We also had the wild boar nachos. I was wishing that there was a higher ratio of meat and fixings to chips because the meat was still delicious. 

Finally we finished off our reveling with tamales, ordering both the duck and the short rib. The duck was my favorite, and it had a more mild flavor, but it was still rich. A hint of sweetness to the meat made it just perfect. The short rib, on the other hand, was the ultimate savory dish. Almost reminded me of a Mexican version of my grandmother's pit roast, so obviously, I loved it. (Grandma makes a mean roast.). 

All in all, totally happy with the experience. Front of the house, back of the house and the bar totally slayyyyed it tonight. Carni- I'll be back."}
{"text":"Really happy with our first visit to El Carnicero, (no matter how stupid I feel stumbling over the name.) We got the recommended boar nachos, goat cheese guac, cucumber marg, mango marg and a beer with hot sauce in it and my bill was still under $40, so I'm not sure why everyone is complaining about the prices. I don't remember anything on the menu above $15 and the food quality is great. The other people with me tried two different tamales and everyone was in hog heaven. 
Also the service was great and we were just sitting at the bar, so I assume table service would be top notch. 

I'm also not sure why people are snidely saying it's a Momocho 2. I mean, it's not like they are trying to hide the affiliation, and also, people love that place, right? Spazzes. 

The only reason El Carnicero doesn't get 5 stars is because their happy hour ends at 6p, and I think that's just silly. Looking forward to going again!"}
{"text":"I had the adobo pork shoulder which was very flavorful moist and delicious the beans, guacamole , and chicharon it was served with her also delicious. I highly recommend this dish. I sat at the bar and the bartender was pretty knowledgeable about the tequilas in Mexico I made a solid recommendation it wasn't very busy and the service was a little slow.  I highly recommend based on this one visit.  I rarely give a restaurant 5 stars.   I'll have to eat here a few more times."}
{"text":"Disappointed... loved the decor but the food and drink was definitely lacking in flavor. My 15$ dollar flight of margaritas were just three glasses of really sweet fruit juices. And the spicy mango margarita might have just been mango juice with a dash of cinnamon or cay
enne. Not impressed. What a waste. Our friends ordered some goat cheese guacamole appetizer which was the best part of the meal... my husband's entree was a chicken taco. The chicken was three strips of unseasoned blackened chicken. When he asked for some kind of hot sauce to flavor it with the waitress said that the chef \"doesn't like spicy foods\". She brought him an unlabeled bottle of some kind of mild salsa... I had the lamb tamale which was definitely not worth the 15$ price tag. Wouldn't come back unless it was absolutely necessary and happy hour so everything was half price"}
{"text":"This place is wonderful. It's a big restaurant, but fills up fast. My friend and I got there around 7pm on a Friday and it was a 45minute wait for a table, but the bar was open. So, we sat right down at the bar for dinner! We ordered the sample margarita platter which was good. We got the blood orange, hibiscus flower and pomegranate. They all tasted pretty similar, but were great!

We dove into the guacamole and queso dip next. The queso wasn't as creamy as most queso dips are. It was pretty liquid-y, but had a nice smokey Gouda flavor. The guacamole was delicious and each dip came with a big basket of fresh tortilla chips. 

Our entrees really were amazing. My friend and I split the Carne Asadas and the Al Pastor Taquito. Both meats were cooked to perfection. The fries that came with the carne asadas had parsley, cheese and a hint of garlic to them which made them so flavorful. The prices are a around $12-18 but you definitely get all your money's worth. We took our leftovers home which was enough for a giant second meal. I definitely recommend this place! Great service, great atmosphere, and beyond great food."}
{"text":"After visiting their sister restaurant Momocho, and being blown away with the food we were excited to try this place since they are open for lunch on the weekends. The atmosphere is cool and cozy, nice luchador artwork and masks on the walls. Our server was very friendly, accommodating and helpful. The menu looks amazing with great mod mex fair. 

Items ordered: 
Guac trio 1. Goat cheese, tomato, Chile poblano 2. Jicama, pineapple, mint, Chile habanero 3. Smoked trout, bacon, Chile pobkano. While all sounding completely amazing the taste was not. Now granted the smoked trout had great flavor, all the guacamole tasted the same, lacked flavor and very bland.

Queso Fundido (chorizo pork sausage, melted cheese, Chile rajitas). This was absolutely delicious. Definelty great cheese pull, and the chorizo was seasoned perfectly. 

Pato Tamale (corn masa tamale, duck leg confit, red + green mole, queso, crema). I would have to say this was my favorite. The duck was tender and had wonderful seasoning. And a great combination with the red and green mole.

Pescado taquitos (chimichurri glazed mahi, pineapple guac). The mahi mahi was over cooked and bland. Even though the chimichurri sauce had great flavor it did not help the fish at all.

Lengua taquitos (beef tongue pastrami, pickled jalapeno mustard crema). The beef tongue was dry, under seasoned and did not have any pastrami flavor. 

Fried Brussels sprouts w/coconut vinegar and chile dusted peanuts. Now these were definitely a star everything in this dish worked.

Chicharron w/spinach, hominy, pineapple vinegar, and valentina hot sauce. Nice combination, but it seemed the hot sauce brought the only flavor. 

Churros w/cream cheese and fruit salsa. The little gems were super delicious. Perfect amount of cinnamon sugar, great crunchy exterior with a soft interior. Tip: the sauces work better when you mix them together."}
{"text":"For the Mexican Food Lovers:

This place is a Must Try! Located in Lakewood, on Detroit Rd. The food is awesome. I had the Duck Leg Confit Tamales with Pork Belly Refried beans. And their special House Habanero Sauce! My girlfriend had the Braised Short-rib Tamales with their pepas fritas (a simple yet delicious order of thin cut fries with  \"chimichuro sauce\" and grated cheese)... Ugh. So much food, so much flavor, so delicious! 
Their selection of fresh salsa and fresh guacamole with chips is also a must try - I had the Tomato Chile salsa and Goat Cheese Guac. 

Full service bar, plenty of margaritas and Mexican beers to choose from! 

This place is awesome and we will definitely be back for more soon!"}
{"text":"I have been here many times now. And because The very popular Bomba opened up just a few months ago, I thought I should update and make a comparison. 

El Carcino has a longer menu than Bomba with similar choices. Neither is your run of the mill Mexican place. I have to give the nod to El Carcina because of the variety they offer of additional items, tamales etc. The pork belly, goat, wild boar are all amazing. Bomba has some excellent choices too and maybe a slight edge on drink quality with all the fresh squeezed limes for the margaritas. 

But the 4-7 food and drink happy hour at the bar at every day at El Carcina gives it the value edge. 

Both can be difficult to park at during dinner hours during the weekend."}
{"text":"My wife & I have eaten here at least once a week since we moved to Lakewood. The service at the bar is consistently good as are the regular dishes we order (Machaca tequitos, happy hour boar nachos, crab guacamole, margaritas...all very highly recommended!)"}
{"text":"Very good... Just a little overpriced. The fajitas they give you were very small for the large portion of meat they give you for the taquitos. But the chips and guac was amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Always consistently good here. Nice selection of proteins, carefully prepared guacamole. VERY good vegetarian selections if so inclined. Try the beet and goat cheese taquitas....EXCELLENT FLAVOR. Margarita's are tasty, some good flavors ...red bell pepper is a favorite, as well as cucumber. Prices are fair and plenty of food. One of our favorite casual places to get some consistent food ."}
{"text":"As a fan of Momocho I've been looking to try this place for a while. I made it there Friday night, we got there at about 9:30PM and there was a 30 minute wait for 2. 

IT was about 10-15 minutes before we got a table which was fine because we grabbed margaritas while we were waiting. I really like the space because it's much bigger than Momocho and since it's always crowded it's nice to have some breathing room. It's got the same vibe as Momocho decor-wise but it brighter and more of a bar feel. Plus there is parking! 

Once we were seated our server brought us water and gave us some time to look over the menu. He was fairly attentive through out or meal. I got the chupacabra tamale (braised goat) with a side of rice, and he got the mahi mahi taquitos. We both really enjoyed our meals and the margaritas are always on point. 

Of course, I must say I have had better tamales, the texture was not consistent all the way through and so if you are used to really good tamales these will be good enough but not great. The real star of the dish was the goat. If the tamales were better I would have to give this place 5-stars.

I'll definitely be back to try the other dishes. I'm glad I made it out to El Carnicero finally."}
{"text":"I really do love this place, my boyfriend and I walk up here often. While you do have to get there early if you want a seat at the bar (our preferred seating arrangement), the food can be downright intoxicating. I highly recommend getting the guacamole sampler, as their guacs are all pretty awesome and unique. My favorite dish there though is the citrus-stewed pork tamales. SO GOOD. My only negative that I will note is that the service could use some fine-tuning, depending on who waits on you. But overall, four stars and a great asset to Lakewood!"}
{"text":"The menu reminded me of mimocho. After waiting for 40min on a Saturday evening we were seated around 9:30pm. The service was prompt and the staff were courteous and attentive. The decor is mod. This is a great addition to the modern Mexican restaurant scene on the west side. 
The price is reasonable. The guac was fresh, the pineapple habenero jicama guac was tasty and not that spicy. The margarita sampler was priced at $15 for 3. We tried the bloody orange, cucumber and pineapple, all were delicious and refreshing. 
Tinga  chicken  with tortilla was cooked perfectly and went very well with the tortilla and the grilled veggies and the salsa and verde sauce. Chicken tamales was spiced right and tasty. Overall the restaurant is well worth a second visit. Not really kid friendly but they were accommodative"}
{"text":"Calling all Spicy Margarita fans!!! The red bell pepper margarita is one of the best I have had in a while!

I was skeptical at first about the flavor, but it was so so yummy and tasted just like a bell pepper (which I admit does not sound appealing to drink at first). The flavored margaritas are $9 but they also have the option of a margarita sampler for $15 where you can choose 3 flavors to try. I highly recommend this because they have great options like Honey-ginger, hibiscus and cucumber. 

The bar is also huge and has tons of seating. They even have a private bar section for parties. Seems like it would be an awesome place for a birthday or corporate event!"}
{"text":"Wonderful place! Atmosphere is cool and fun! Love the masks up everywhere! My mojito was delicious! And lovvved the guacamole!!! Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Blown away by the flavors they can somehow get into each dish.  I ate the el Pastor tamale and shared the goat cheese guac.   Wow.  

Will definitely come back here"}
{"text":"Two of us came in on a Friday night around 8pm. We were able to find seats at the bar. It should be noted that they don't take reservations. 

I'd recommend the chips and guac to start off. If you're in to margaritas, definitely get the sampler - blood orange is my favorite.

The only tacos I've had were the chicken tacos, which were slightly spicy in a good way. The tacos were served with fresh tortillas separate from the meat and two types of salsa. The taco plate was enough to split between people especially after eating the chips and guac.

I'd definitely come here again!"}
{"text":"I ordered salsa habanero on recommendation of the waitress. It wasn't good. Way too sweet. Also ordered the guac with crab pickled corn and chile chipotle. It was pretty good and the best thing I had here. Nothing to write home about. Main courses are limited to tamales and taqutios a bunch of different ways.  I ordered the al pastor. It's was really dry and I'm not a huge fan of corn tortillas so it didn't help at all since that's all they have I guess. I want to give this place another try because the waitress and atmosphere was nice. Probably won't because it just doesn't fill my Mexican craving."}
{"text":"Had lunch at El Carnicero during the work week with a few colleagues. Right away I was a big fan of this restaurant's interior; it has an animated, yet trendy theme that really adds to the experience of eating here. I had the el cordero (braised lamb) taquitos and a taste of the goat cheese and orange sesame guacamoles. The portion sizes were large, came out fairly quickly, and everything was delicious. My only reservations are the slightly high price point, and the relatively slow speed of the lunch order-taking; although, it is definitely not enough of a deterrent to keep me from coming back."}
{"text":"You know why you come to Momocho or El Carnicero - guacamole and tequila drinks? Right? But if that's all you're here for (like the couple seated next to us at the bar on our last visit who've ever tried anything else - til they saw our food) - you're missing out.

I've had the most amazing taquitos and tamales (wild boar is just delicious pig by another name people). But the dinner special last night just blew me away. Marinated steak, with onions, mushrooms and peppers, cheese and radish was perfection. One of the best steak dishes I've had in Cleveland (and that includes the amazing rib eye at Crop).

Their coffee (yes coffee) is also an unexpected delight ...  served in a paper cup and flavored with a hint of brown sugar and cinnamon ... with a little cream it's the perfect way to cool down from the habanero orange and sesame guacamole. hey, I go for the guacamole, too ...

But to really get the most out of every visit, I always ask about the nightly special and recommend you do the same. Dig deeper than the expected. Oh, and arrive a little early ... Saturday means 5:30 ... right in the middle of Hora de Feliz ... and grab a spot at the bar for great service and the bar-only drink specials and Wild Boar nachos. 

The guac and tequila will always be there - but they've become just a small part of the reason we choose to head out to Lakewood (reverse food commuting) from the near west side."}
{"text":"Excellent wild boar nachos and the spicy mango larger it is on point. The server Brad is an absolute delight!"}
{"text":"Update: how have I not been here for happy hour (or la hora feliz) until recently?  Those wild boar nachos are off the hook-- and only five bucks!"}
{"text":"This place is Momocho with a different name in a larger space.  That's ok with since it's run by the same folks.  That also means it inherits the pros and cons from Momocho.  The food is fine.  I think, overall, the experience is overpriced in certain areas.  If you're not drinking or eating chips and salsa, you can get away with spending $15 for a single dinner, but that hardly happens.  So you end up spending a few dollars on ho-hum salsa (there's nothing amazing about it), you spend too much on a mixed drink because it contains top shelf liquor that really shouldn't be mixed in the first place, and you end up spending a few extra dollars on basic sides.  A dinner for two can turn into a $70 affair very easily.  Again, that's not bad, but they've skillfully made the place look less expensive than it actually is.  I wouldn't necessarily have a problem paying that much for dinner if the food was a bit more interesting.  Perhaps I've just reached a point where I want a lot of weird ingredients if I'm spending more than double a fast food meal? 

Even so, I can't say this place sucks.  The food does indeed taste good and the drinks are good.  The happy hour is where this place really shines.  With two bars and some very good happy hour deals, this is a great spot for after-work fun.  I found the bar service to be well run--all the bartenders at both bars were super attentive even with the place jam packed.  I didn't even have to flag someone down for my first order or a refill.  That's impressive.  So 5-stars to the bar crew.

The weight-staff at the tables were a little different.  Everyone seemed rushed and really trying hard for fast turn times.  I get it, the place is busy and you need to get everyone seated and you also need to maximize your earnings.  But it wasn't a relaxing experience.  At least in Momocho I can sit back a little bit and take my time.  If I'm spending a extra on what's essentially pulled pork, I want to be able to savor the stuff.  I couldn't do that here.  Also, the water filling was way too aggressive.  At one point, the guy filled all the cups on the table with water, including the cocktail glasses that still had booze in them.  He didn't flinch or even pause when we told him to stop.  Whoops.  

In the end, it's not a bad joint, I just don't know that I'm getting the value I want out of this style of food.  I'll certainly frequent the bar, but I might not be a regular diner here.  The execution is great, it all looks good, and I'm not unhappy I ate here by any stretch, it just felt like I was overspending on the overall experience.  Perhaps if I'm a DD next time, I'll be alright with eating at this joint, which is exactly how I feel about Momocho. But everyone seems to love Momocho, so good on them.  If you dig on Momocho, you'll dig on this place too.  Have at it and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Agree with other reviewer: Momocho II..... But who cares, Momocho is packed anyway.  Had the Tamales and some amazing Tequilla.   This place will pack up right at dinner and thin out later in the evening.   Best eating here for me would be at the bar."}
{"text":"Atmosphere = fab. Service = adorable. Food = maybe I should learn more about Mexican culture in the Cleve before being too critical...

This place is visually clearly a hot spot, from the bar side to the private dining room (SCORE) to the regular restaurant side. The night we visited, all of the waiters and bartenders seemed to be white men with brown beards of various body sizes. I was amused by some of the guacamole combos, and all of the salsas sounded great. I may have licked the bowl. Our waiter recommended several dishes, and I went with the Taquitos Pescado. It was very very good. My dining companion ordered a tamale dish...and no. Not tamale like. Yes, its masa...but its not a tamale."}
{"text":"Damn, that was impressive. Started off with a spicy mango margarita. It could have have been larger, however it was amazing. We had a salsa trio that was fantastic. I followed that with the lingua or tongue tacos that were oh my good. Super tender and perfectly prepared. Everyone at the table had something different and everything was good. Service was also excellent as well."}
{"text":"I wanted to go to Momocho for lunch but since they don't open until 5, I decided to try El Carnicero. The menu was very similar (if not identical) to Momocho. The interior was very similar as well. 

We ordered a margarita sampler - the spicy mango was still the best, while the cucumber and pineapple were very refreshing. 

The goat cheese guac was still on point and the chicken tacos were well seasoned and grilled to perfection. My husband had the carnitas which he enjoyed. He wound up having two fatty hunks in his meal and the chef was nice enough to bring out him some extra pieces. 

We sat at the bar and service was really good."}
{"text":"Drinks are good food is also good service was great was seated quickly just a little dark hard to read the menu had to use phone for more light"}
{"text":"I went here for the first time with my parents from out of town and my boyfriend.  I was pleasantly surprised with how large the restaurant was - it looks small on the outside.  In comparison to Momocho, it's about double in size or maybe bigger.  

El Carnicero has a great atmosphere and I experienced excellent service.  Both the bartender and waitress we had really new the menu items and recommended things they thought we'd like.  I was very happy with my meal (I had a seafood special) and I really enjoyed the goat cheese guacamole and spicy margarita I had.  We all left happy and full! 

I'd definitely go back, it's a gem in Lakewood!"}
{"text":"Quite overpriced for sure, but I am glad I tried it. Stopped in for lunch with my dining companion and had the wild boar tamales and brisket taquitos. I had the highest hopes for the wild boar tamales but I actually liked the brisket taquitos better. The taquitos are different than you would expect as they come out in a bowl with soft corn taco shells, build your own style. The meat was very flavorful but the whole meal lacked variety as far as extras go. It was just meat with a couple thin onion slices. The entree also included a tiny cup of guacamole and of verde salsa, both very flavorful but not generously sized.  I get it, the focus of the meal is the meat, but there wasn't very much of that either. That being said, everything tasted great. 

We also ordered habanero salsa and chips. The salsa was very spicy which I like. It was also a small bowl, I would have eaten the whole serving in about 3 bites if it had been milder. And you pay for chips and salsa - $2.50 per serving. 

Parking out back wasn't too bad on a Saturday afternoon but I can imagine it being a disaster on a busy night. 

The final comment I have about the experience here is that no one was welcoming or friendly to the customers.  Our server was nice about explaining the menu but the feeling I got overall was that no one was pleased to be working there."}
{"text":"I wasn't really impressed with the menu..but maybe it's not what I was expecting. Prices aren't too bad. Happy Hour prices are actually pretty good! 

So, I had the traditional guacamole and al pastor taquitos.. the guac was about average, nothing special. Kind of plain.. so I would try something else next time. The pork was absolutely delicious! Flavorful, tender and so juicy! 

I will definitely go back to try something different, especially during happy hour! I have my eye on the pork nachos!"}
{"text":"I'd like to give more stars, but I think I've been ruined by personal experience. I frequent Momocho so that's the benchmark for my El Carnicero visit. 

The food is great, but menu selection is limited. Boar Nachos were fantastic, as were the different guacamoles. Drinks were really good, especially the spicy mango Margaritas. 

The biggest issue was inconsistent service. Our table had lots of empty dishes and glasses that remained on our table from the beginning until we paid our bill. Our server was really personable, but she disappeared towards the end of our meal, especially when we were interested in after-dinner drinks and dessert. (FYI: they only have 1 dessert per night and it rotates. Not good if you crave fried ice cream, like my pregnant wife did. Things got ugly.)

El Carnicero is a great place for a midweek elevated meal. The food is great, but the service is just OK. Don't expect a full experience like Momocho. El Carn is like the gateway to the full ModMex Momocho experience. So, go for typical dining, and save Momocho for special occasions."}
{"text":"Stopped at El Carnicero a few Sundays ago on our SundayFunday local spot crawl. Had a few craft tequila cocktails and appetizers. 

The service was great - our waiter was very attentive, provided recommendations for menu items, and took the time to explain differences between the flavor profiles of drinks & some of the dishes. 

The appetizers we had, a salsa flight and chicken skins, were delicious. Each of the salsas and guac carried different flavors that were not overpowering or too spicy to eat. 

My absolute favorite part was the daily made hot sauce they sell in the unlabeled bottle. After trying some at the restaurant we purchased a bottle for home. 

A bit higher on the pricing scale especially for Mexican food. It is worth the cost and I will be going back again."}
{"text":"Atmosphere was very loud. Communal seating means you will be sitting with strangers. The food wasn't bad, but was waaaay overpriced and too salty. This is basically mexican street fare, things like tamales. How can you charge $15 for a tamale? The service was also subpar. The waiter was not very attentive and appeared annoyed at some of our questions. He did not check on us or refill our drinks. There are MANY BETTER SIMILAR RESAURANTS IN LAKEWOOD! Taco Tonto's, Barrio, Barroco, El Tango, all within 5 min of this place! Save your money and go to one of those. This place is way to TRENDY AND OVERPRICED. There is no reason to go here when you can go to a great place like El Tango and get a better meal in a less pretentious atmosphere at half the price!"}
{"text":"Although this restaurant doesn't take reservations, they said they would accommodate our party of 8 for a Saturday because we were a larger group and everyone was traveling out of state for a baby shower. When we go there, they had no record of our reso and were told that we can either wait 45 min. or leave. After the 45 min wait and still no table, the host told us that \"everyone else is waiting too, so too bad.\"  We waited a total of 1 hr and 15 min for a table (with a pregnant woman! ) Left at 11pm. WORST service ever with the WORST attitude from the staff because their employee screwed up. At least the food was good, but not worth a 4 hr dinner!"}
{"text":"By far the best nachos around! The $5 happy hour wild boar nachos never disappoint! They also make a delicious ( but very hot) hot sauce that goes very well with the nachos. The margaritas are also very good. The chile lime salt rim goes very well with the classic margarita. I look forward to happy hour at El Carnicero!"}
{"text":"Fills my stomach with food I long for.

One thing I miss about Southern California is the abundance of Mexican food. Let me clarify, when I say \"Mexican food\" I mean cuisine cooked in the styles of northern and southern Mexico and Baja California, not Tex Mex or southwestern-whatever. 

I haven't found a place that primarily serves authentic Mexican, but El Carnicero comes pretty darn close. This place has excellent food, and the flavors of some dishes bring back flavors of nostalgia with a twist. I definitely recommend El Carnicero if your looking for some excellent Mexican-ish food.  They have a GREAT tequila selection, and the margaritas are some of the best I've ever had. 

If your new to the area (like me) here's a tip: taquitos are not those deep fried, rolled up, pathetic taco fingers you find in the frozen food section. Here, taquitos are soft tacos with plenty of tortilla refills and a generous portion of your desired protein. 

PS-Go to happy hour and get TWO orders of the wild boar nachos...oh my lord.
PPS-They do sell the the lucha libre masks. So pick one up."}
{"text":"I found myself scanning the reviews posted for El Carnicero before posting my own and I have to say I agree with a majority of them. This place has both positive and negative qualities. I'll break it down as simply as possible since my points seem to be a metaanalysis of other reviews.

Environment- El Carnicero, the sister of Momocho but located in Lakewood, has lots of cool vibes. The decor includes a massive wrap around bar, Mexican wrestling masks, black letter boards, low key lighting, and mix-and-match seating. The bathrooms were super clean, there is ample seating (even during busy happy hour times) and there is space for private events. 

Food- I've been to El Carnicero several times and food is consistently good. The meats always seem to have a depth and complexity of flavor and the guacamole's are very creative! There are also some very interesting vegetarian and vegan options which might just be appealing to an omnivore as well. Also, I'm not a person who doesn't likes margaritas (I know, I know...) but I get down with their margaritas, especially the cucumber marg. The happy hour menu is also very nice! We had the pork nachos during our most recent visit and they were delicious. I'm also a fan of the tamales! 

Service- Okay, this is where El Carnicero goes from a 5 star to a 4 star. We typically sit at the bar and every time we have eaten there our bartender/server has been super aloof. We got our drinks ordered and then didn't see him for a lonnnng time. It got to the point where I questioned whether he was our only point person since I saw several other people working in and around the area. When our food order was finally taken the food did come out promptly and at a good temperature. I'll just say that the service was somewhat disengaged and I wouldn't consider this place 100% hipster. So there is room for improvement in that area. 

Prices- I feel like the prices can be a little steep (between $12-16 for a plate of Taquitos, tamales and their other mod mex entrees). Happy hour is 4-7pm and there a good deals to be found there if you sit at the bar, and with the size of the bar(s) there shouldn't be much of a problem getting a seat. I'm willing to pay those prices because I enjoy the food, but there are other \"authentic\" Mexican joints in the area that are much less expensive.

Overall, I enjoy El Carnicero and will certainly be back again. If you're looking for a place with a cool vibe, complex flavors or a good happy hour you should check it out and see for yourself!"}
{"text":"Oh my goodness!  My husband and I stopped by El Carnicero after bicycling through the Metroparks from Berea.  We arrived at 4pm on a Saturday, just in time for Happy Hour, and boy were we happy!
I had heard about this place and read reviews before seeking it out.  Even though it is all about meat (El Carnicero=The Butcher), I saw that it had a decent selection of vegetarian options for myself.
We first ordered a couple of the traditional margaritas ($5 each during happy hour) with a special touch of chili-lime salted rims. Very refreshing.
 I wanted to try the sikil pak, since I had never heard of it before.  It is a dip made with ground pumpkin seeds, chili manzano, and there may possibly be some tomatillos in there as well, I'm not sure.  But it is wonderful and addicting. That came with a big basket of tortilla chips. 
My husband ordered the wild boar nachos. For the $5 happy hour price, it was a very generous serving. I tried a few of the chips w/o the meat and really liked the addition of fresh corn sprinkled on top of the nachos.
I ordered la coliflor, a tamale entree, to share. The presentation was beautiful and the flavors so extraordinario!  I guess I would describe it as a curried cauliflower, served over masa and served in corn husks.  There were some raisins in it, which added a sweet touch, and two separate sauces; a mole sauce and a Verde sauce.  It looked picture-perfect, with a decoration of watercress(?) on top.
We ate at the bar and had such a great waitress who answered our questions and offered wonderful suggestions.  She and our servers gave us just the right amount of attention.
We were so stuffed.  If we didn't have to ride our bikes all the way back to Berea, we certainly would have ordered some more margaritas or tried some of their specialty beers!  There's always next time!"}
{"text":"They did an awesome job transforming the old McCarthys. i just wished during transformation they would have added more bathrooms for a restaurant of this size.

The margaritas are to die for. Highly recommend the blood orange or the cucumber with the spices around the glass. The chips and salsa are wonderful - really liked the pineapple mango salsa.

The food was okay. The menu was needed explanations for a lot of the dishes. i ordered the tinga and the chicken was dry. 

Servers were all really friendly, they gave good recommendations on what to order. i would definitely go back, most likely for a happy hour and apps."}
{"text":"Really nothing more to add. Excellent is the word for today's meal. Machaca, al pastor and tinga oh my!  Guacamole trio great and camarones taquitos were just good . Return? Indeed."}
{"text":"this chef is one of the top 3 in this town. food is inspired and phenomenal. service is excellent. guacamole is perfection. we have been several times and always love the food. the tequila and mezcal list is pretty impressive too! i've had many things on the menu so it's hard to pick a favorite. also the ambiance is cool as hell! great vibe!"}
{"text":"It all started because I wanted a drink after work  then someone mentioned $5 Wild Boar Nachos and the rest is me laying in a food coma on my couch. 

I highly suggest people check this place out, just be warned that after 6:30pm  this place is going to fill up fast and get loud. (At least on a Friday night)

A friend and I split the nachos mentioned above, guac with goat cheese, Al Pastor Taquitos, and a side of refried beans. The portions were big enough to share and there was a little leftover to take home. My only complaint would be that for $14 the taquito entree should have included the side instead of having to pay extra for it. 

Definitely get the Margarita Flight to go with your meal. We shared the Hibiscus Flower, Cucumber, and this spicy mango margarita that makes you feel all nice and warm inside."}
{"text":"Great food and ambiance.  The guacamole with goat cheese is great!  Menu has great options an spins on typical Mexican dishes the taquitos and the chick arrimes.  The margaritas are great specially the spicy mango margarita. Small but good selection of tequilas."}
{"text":"Stopped here on a Sunday for lunch.  Not very busy, just a few tables, so we were seated immediately.  Service was friendly and relatively efficient.  Decor is really cool (love the Lucha Libre masks), as I'm sure others have mentioned.  Great tap beer selection, as well.

As for the food...solid.  I had the Machaca taquitos (coffee & ancho braised brisket).  The flavor was very rich, and the portion was sufficient...only complaint would be that the corn tortillas were much too small, IMO.  On the other hand, my mom's Avacado Toast was one of the best things I have eaten in recent memory.  Although the toast was a little crispy, the other ingredients combined to make a really tasty dish.  I strongly recommend that you go on the weekend to try that toast.  Damn, it was good.

Thinking I'll be back with the entire crew in tow at some point soon."}
{"text":"I was here a year or two ago and now that I live nearby I dropped in for dinner and was not disappointed. Goat cheese guacamole is delicious and you have enough food the taquitos. I came in on a Tuesday and they have $5 tequila. I got to try something new without breaking the bank and it was delicious."}
{"text":"You haven't tried this place yet yourself? Really? You must not live here. Or are averse to Mexican themed fare. Or are living under a rock. Or I dunno. Something really bizarre. 

But if you're reading this, it would seem you're trying to decide whether you should go. 

Yes. You should. 

Why?

- The food: This is not *really* Mexican. It's more like Mexican (or even a more South American) inspired foodie food. Note: This is not a bad thing. Everything I've tried there has been at least solidly good, some of it, like the Kobe abondigas (sadly, not on the regular menu, but a special), have been downright fantastic. The tamales are good and very filling - the taquitos feel like a bit less food in the end, but still yummy. I've tried a couple of the guacs - not the best I've ever had anywhere - but very tasty (goat cheese in guac is still one of my favorite things, though that's a holdover from Momocho). The chancho (boar) was surprisingly tender and juicy. Between my companion's and my own orders, I do believe I've tried every one of the meats, and I've not found one yet that I could complain about. The green beans are scrumptious - and the brussel sprouts - with pork and if I recall correctly a coconut vinegar - made me drool a little. (I waited until I got home and was enjoying the leftovers to actually let the drool go. But there you have it.) A friend of mine claims the asparagus is fantastic too. I will say that it wasn't bad, but I don't like asparagus much. (So the fact that I say it wasn't bad is probably a heck of a compliment.) 

- The tequila: One of the best, if not *the* best, tequila lists in Lakewood. The margaritas are apparently also fantastic, but I have yet to try one personally, so that's merely hearsay. 

- The service: Seriously, everyone that works there has been amazingly friendly and energetic and willing to answer questions in such an enthusiastic way that I question whether they're all being given some sort of happy pill at the beginning of their shift. I can't promise this will be your experience, but I really have loved everyone there I've dealt with. (And no, I do not know anyone who works there personally or an owner or stakeholder of any kind. I have really just had that good of an experience with the service.)  

- The house habanero sauce. So delicious I bought a bottle to go the last time I was there. It's hot, but super tasty too -- not just heat. 

You think you should skip it because... 

- It's expensive. Yep, it's on the pricey side. I won't deny that at all. Personally, I believe it to be worth the price. I haven't been disappointed in the food yet, and if the higher prices are what bring me the great service and atmosphere to go with the great food - I'm down for that. 

- It's overhyped/hipster/whatever lame you-think-you're-too-cool-to-follow-the-crowd excuse you come up with: Nope. Get over yourself. 

Go there as soon as you can. 

I wish I was eating there tonight."}
{"text":"The service is great, the food is great, but no wifi. 

Obviously, food is number 1 for a restaurant and then service is number 2, but this day and age if you want to look up something real quick or respond to something important or relax and use your computer, it helps for a restaurant to offer fast wifi to its patrons.

The server explained to me that they process credit cards over wifi and it wouldn't be safe to share the password. I can understand this, however, pay the $50 extra per month for a separate line of wifi for your customers! 

I'm often very busy and have to do work on the go, and when factoring in places to eat, I would have to factor out Carnicero and they would lose my dollars... :/ I don't want to see a restaurant lose my business because of a basic amenity that every modern restaurant offers.

Carnicero, please hop into 2015 and you'll get my 5th star!"}
{"text":"Love.  Amazing food!  I've been here about half a dozen times with different groups of friends and it has become everyone's most fav place.  With a lot of great places in CLE and the westside that says a lot.  The menu has two options of entrees and then in each category there are a bunch of choices.  So Tamales and Taquitos (small flour tortillas with fillings that you put together similar to fajitas) with lots of unique fillings that you get to choose between.  

Personally, I really love the tamales which are a much more filling dish than the taquitos.  I'm not a big meat eater and although it may sound odd the curried cauliflower tamales are incredible.  The meat items my friends have had also look fabulous and they almost licked their plates for every last drop.  They also have lots of unique and interesting sides that are generous portions and so good.  I've tasted many of them and sometimes think maybe I'll get a few sides for my meal and forget the entrees.

Now about their drinks and guacamole.  Be still my heart.  The flight of margaritas is an awesome way to try their very unique flavors -- they all are excellent. I was surprised to love the hibiscus and the pineapple and surprised that I didn't like the cucumber.  My friends however picked the cuke as their fav so it really is each to their own.  Now, the piece de resistance for me is the guacamole which seriously is the BEST guac I've ever tasted.  Fresh, chunky and lots of it.  They have many varieties and I could consume a dish by myself although I have always shared.  My fav is the one with goat cheese.  They have a house made salsa haberna that is good and hot and the chips seem to be house made.  I've been once just for a very happy hour of margaritas (they do have good beers on tap/bottles and a long tequila list) and chips + salsa and guac.  They have happy hour boar nachos which others assure me are fabulous.  

Just once we had dessert to share.  They offer one dessert which I believe changes but whatever it was that we had for my friend's bday was sooo good.  The service is always good, servers are knowledgeable about the dishes and attentive.  

No reservations although call ahead for parties of 8+.  If there is a wait there is a large wrap-around bar and another in the back plus a long area across from that bar for overflow folks to sit and enjoy a drink and appetizer. 

Great d√©cor and awesome food. Brunch menu on Sundays.  Very limited parking in the back but lots of safe street parking all around.  

A fabulous addition to Lakewood and Cleveland.  Run, don't walk for a great time!"}
{"text":"Ate here several times before writing this review because l wanted to really like this place. I mean look at some of the reviews!

However, in my most recent trip I'm convinced this place is hyped. Friend and I came here to eat dinner and we ordered the guacamole with feta as an appetizer, and the braised beef and the wild boar as the entree 

The guacamole was tasty, but they served us stale chips mixed in with fresh chips. 

I think this place is a bit hyped. Food is tasty but not jaw dropping amazing as some of the comments here suggest. Perhaps it's the atmosphere that gets people that artificial feeling the food is amazing here... Because I will give these guys, the architecture and decor of this place is amazing.

Menu here is a bit confusing and be sure  to add a side dish, as it's not included in your entree."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now. The first time I went I swear I wouldn't go back!! The food was underwhelming and overly salty. Like so salty I couldn't even eat it. 

The second time I went I didn't have much say in where we were eating so I just went with it. I'm glad I tried it again as everything was excellent. Especially the boar nachos. I even tried tongue for the first time. 

In both experiences the best, most unique thing about this place are the margarita flights!!"}
{"text":"I can't say enough about how great my experience was here. They transformed the old McCarthys bar into a mod Mex restaurant. I was a little skeptical when I drove by a few times but the reviews on Yelp are what seriously steered me to finally visit. I wish I would've tried sooner. We walked in and got a spot in the back bar. The decor is awesome. The colorful paintings to the many luchadore masks lining the walls. Had the guacamole sampler and it was fantastic. Machacha was next. Tasted every great as Momocho. I hate to compare this place to Momocho but it is very similar....except this place is bigger. Much much bigger. Read the reviews. Try this place. It's great and I'll be back soon"}
{"text":"I very much enjoyed the food here, The pork belly was fantastic and the guacamole was delish with the salsas. the bartender was amazing with service and i was actually pretty sad that day meeting my friend and he really turned the night around honestly i would go back just cus of the service alone"}
{"text":"I tried El Carnicero for the first time about 2 months ago.  I've been back twice since!  There's seemingly a lot of mixed reviews, but I don't have one complaint about this place!  Yes, I've been there on nights when it was packed, and there was almost a two hour wait.  Not necessarily a bad thing... We were seated in a little under two hours and service was great from the moment we were seated not just this time but every time I've been there.  If people have had issues with service here in the past, seems to me they've shaped up since then.

The food is spectacular.  I think the portion size is perfect for the price and the food is flavorful and unique!  It never fails that whomever I'm dining with starts off with the Goat Cheese Guac.  I don't even care for Guac and I could finish one of these myself! To. Die. For.  I've tried a few different entrees: Machaca Tamales (Beef Brisket), Costilla Tamales (Short Ribs), and Barriga Taquitos (Pork Belly).  All are EXCELLENT!  I did prefer the tamales over the taquitos.  I think it's just a more interesting dish.  The Machaca and Costilla Tamales seemed pretty similar.  They both have the kind of spice that makes you sweat a little from the inside, but the flavor is definitely there and it's definitely worth a trip to experience for yourself.  You won't be sorry!  I hear they have a great Happy Hour too!"}
{"text":"Food was great , drinks was freaking amazing. I'd give it five star but the costumer service needs to approve just a little."}
{"text":"Happy hour is amazing here, $5 house margs $5 nachos and an array of other items. Past happy hour all of their food is amazing but I feel it is slightly over priced. Definitely recommend the marg sampler, goat cheese guacamole, and short rib taquito."}
{"text":"Love the food here, the ambience is great.  Like to eat at the bar.  The staff is great, helpful and always busy....food is always good."}
{"text":"I am so glad this placed moved into the old McCarthy's space!  This has turned out to be one of my favorite date spots, a great spot to bring out of towners, and a fun place to split some guac with friends.  I've been here many times and its always delicious!  I intend to come back many more times- the food is completely amazing.  All the guacs are delicious and the sides are an interesting surprise.  I love the decor as well.  

Only drawback:  the beer menu is limited and not that strong.  I get they are a tequileria- but.... for those of us who are not fans the rest of the drink menu is somewhat limiting."}
{"text":"There's too many things I love about El C. 
The atmosphere, the food, the service, the happy hour, the COFFEE, and those cucumber margaritas. Ugh. SO GOOD. 
Definitely worth the price, and the wait. 
One of my favorite things is the salmon guac. Don't leave without ordering that, and the wild boar tamale or taquitos. Whichever you prefer."}
{"text":"So I'm torn between leaving a three or four star review. Service and food two visits ago were superb. But maybe because we were eating at the bar and our server was always mere steps away. And he was great about checking on us regularly. 

Then, on my last visit -after hyping this place up to out-of-town relatives - service was so slow and inattentive. I was so annoyed. Perhaps it was because of understaffing? The food was decent. Looking at other reviews, it would seem El Carnicero would benefit greatly from focusing on improving service. The food on my half dozen or so visits has ranged from fair to really good. For the prices, service should really be much better."}
{"text":"I very much enjoyed the margarita sampler. And the goat cheese guacamole was unlike anything I've had before. Delicious."}
{"text":"Came in on Sunday evening and it was pretty slow so we figured service would be fast.
I was kind of disappointed that chips and salsa were not complimentary especially with Barrio right down the street which is way more affordable.
We ordered the salsa verde it was good and reasonably priced I suppose for a cup of salsa.
After putting in our order our waiter came back stating they had ran out of what my boyfriend ordered. So as he decided on something else it was like our server forgot that he never completed our order. Ummm hellllllooo we wanna eat!!! 
As we ordered and received our food mine was delicious my boyfriend ordered the carne asada but it seemed light on the meat and heavy on the French fries. 
It was good overall just didn't live up to all the hype I had thought. 
Maybe we should try back on a different night and not late on a Sunday evening.
My pineapple margarita was epic though!"}
{"text":"I love the short menu here! I Had the Huevos rancheros for brunch. It's a filling dish with the right amount of spice. The staff is friendly as always."}
{"text":"Really good food and drinks!! Their sampler margaritas are awesome - they have tons of different flavors.  The wait is usually pretty long so be prepared to linger at the bar. How very I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Ahh!! The Lakewood spin of of my FAVORITE restaurant Momocho. I love this place. A lot less pretentious than Momocho. Diner & Drinks for 2 will set you back $100. But man oh man is it worth it. You have to try the blood orange margarita. We loved the guacamole, we actually continue to get the sampler because we can make up our minds on which we prefer. The duck..... Wow!! One of my favorites. Staff is uber friendly and helpful making recommendations for dishes, (they know the menu well). This is a go to place for special date nights."}
{"text":"Had a dinner with a group of 8 for a birthday.  Blood Orange Margarita with sugar rim was a lovely start... had the guac sampler one crab, one pineapple and mint, one traditional accompanied by red and verde salsa with warm tortilla chips.  Also went with the Wild Boar Nachos which were instantly devoured.  Negro Modelo Lamb Tamale was excellent.  Wife had the pork belly tacos and danced in her seat through her entire meal. Everything was seasoned with a lovely spice palate and authentic taste.  we all ended up sharing everything with everyone enjoying it all!  Service was friendly and attentive, without being interruptive. well done! Best mexican I've had in NE Ohio thus far."}
{"text":"First things first, get the guacamole!!!
Creamy and full of flavor with fresh warm chips. A+
I had the vegetarian (remolacha)taquitos and loved them!! Staff was friendly and I bought one of their \" tacos\" hats because... why not?!?!
Great spot, parking in back!"}
{"text":"All the goodness of Momocho with more bar space!!!  Do yourself a favor and don't miss the goat cheese guacamole!"}
{"text":"The only reason this is not 5 stars is because of the super crappy service we had. Went on a Friday and our waiter could not careless about us. The food was amazing and I understand it's a Friday but that doesn't excuse rude service in my mind."}
{"text":"This place was decent. We ordered the duck confit taquitos and also the garlic shrimp. The duck was kind of dry which was surprising as it's confit. The shrimp however was very flavorful and they were big. My favorite thing here is the MARGARITAS.  It's very rare to find house made margaritas in CLE, but luckily El Carnicero has a great selection with none of that sour mix crap included. You can definitely taste the difference; they're made with love. The guacamole is euphoric. 

As high as the prices are, I think they should include complimentary  chips and salsa and also include a side with the entrees. I was disappointed that everything is a la  carte. I'll be back just for happy hour."}
{"text":"Hi just went today with a big group and we got seated fast and the ambience is nice and comfy not too much light very relaxing they have a lot of lucha libre masks and you can put them on so that's fun. We order chick a rones it was so good the sauce on top delish the goat guacamole the best I ever had and I'm a big fan of goat cheese just for that I give them 10 haha I order the flautas they we're so good crispy delicious had a kick to it prob the sauce but overall really good I would definitely like to come back they prices are a little on the expensive side but to be honest it's worth it once in a while to splurge on good food me. Now the one thing I don't like is they don't have a kids menu  and I have a son that's a must for me when I go to places but hey I don't expect perfection  just something to think about."}
{"text":"At first glance one may see a normal Lakewood restaurant. Dull just like the others. But inside, this lively restaurant peaked my interest. You can tell it is run by an owner who cares about style. The lighting, tables, and dishes are all within theme. The food was delicious and very well presented. This Spanish themed restaurant was stimulating for all the senses. I will be going back. I recommend you try the guacamole."}
{"text":"My friends and I tried the  margarita sample this time... I loved the pineapple one but the strawberry rhubarb is a nice tangy twist on a classic.  There aren't many vegetarian options but the beet spinach tacos are worth a trip for any vegetarian!"}
{"text":"Uh, happy hour was a good selection. I ordered food for dinner and it never came. I was sitting at the bar, it was not that busy, I was bummed they forgot my carne asada and chicarones, but they did save me some money. I don't think I will go back on my own accord, just because the service was sub par, quantity seemed to be the goal over quality from some."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in Lakewood. I've been here a few times and I've had a great time every time. They have a good happy hour until 7 with $5 margaritas/sangria or $2 Morelos. Their crab guacamole is excellent. I've ordered the shredded beef entree both times and love it. The service was friendly and fast. And the overall vibe is lively. Really enjoyed this place and would recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"I love this place. I will be honest, I was the only one of our group of four who really loved it! 
This is a step down from momocho but it is still delicious. The duck tacos are legit and the guac is good too. 
Their drinks are very good! My boyfriend raved about some rooster drink.. It was spicy and I found it strange but I suppose if you like spicy... Go for it! 
The service is seriously lacking here.. The servers all look like deer in the headlights, lost and confused."}
{"text":"The food is not good and over-priced.  I went into the restaurant hungry and left even hungrier. The beans were too salty and the salsa was not good. The boar meat was just nasty.  The service was poor. The waiter offered us no refills on our drinks and barely asked us how our food was.  The atmosphere is loud."}
{"text":"Great margaritas, great food, and great ambiance. Do Carnicero has been on of my favorite Lakewood restaurants for a couple of years. Whenever I go, day or night, the food and drink is always spectacular. Their tamales and tostadas are to die for! If you're in the area give El Carnicero a try. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This was our first visit to Cleveland and came here on a Sunday just before noon to have lunch.  We had a guacamole flight, salsa verde and a flight of margaritas.  The drinks were fantastic with the blood orange being my favorite.  My wife picked the guacamole with goat cheese which ended up being our favorite.  We finished up with the Machaca beef brisket taquitos, not because we were necessarily hungry, but just couldn't resist trying another dish.  We couldn't finish it all and I regretted not being able to take leftovers but we were travelling and that just wasn't an option.  The d√©cor of the restaurant is really cool with all of the lucha libre items hanging on the walls.  If we lived in the area I'm sure we'd be regulars.  Next time in the Cleveland area this will definitely be on the list of stops."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went to Momocho and LOVED it so much that we wanted to try out this place too since it's owned by the same guy. Compared to Momocho, the service and food sucked. I got the same exact dish that I got at Momocho a week prior and I didn't even eat half of it because it wasn't nearly as good. Even the margarita wasn't as good (Momocho's margs are AMAZING, by the way). Momocho is only 10 minutes away from this place, so I don't see any point in going here."}
{"text":"Swung by here for dinner after seeing a show at the Beck Center. I knew it was going to be awesome since I've been to Momocho, but my parents were totally blown away.

I was finally able to get my hands on the goat cheese guac, which totally made my night. Hands down, most delicious item of the evening, but that might be because I never would have expected all those flavors to blend so well. I was a bit concerned about the chile poblano because I love spice but my mom can't handle anything, but there was no noticeable kick. Smooth, creamy, tasty, with nice chunks of goat cheese and a hint of lime. Fabulous. And our chips were fresh out of the fryer!

For an entree, I had the barriga taquito with a side of esquites. The esquites were probably my second favorite item of the evening. The pork belly was also delicious and I am more than pleased about the leftovers currently sitting in the fridge, but the corn just hit a spot with me. If I had to rate my own food, I'd say 10 for the guac and goat cheese, 9.9 for the esquites, and 9.7 for the barriga.

My mom had their special of the evening--beef, pork, lamb, and like two other meats rolled into meatballs and served as a taquito. This was also wonderful and definitely handled all of the different meat tastes very well. General wonderful thing about El Carnicero (and Momocho): they do an awesome job blending flavors. So you could taste the lamb in the meatball and it wasn't just a glob of meat--there was a lot of depth to the flavors. My dad had the chorizo tamale (SO TENDER) and the empanaditas. The empanaditas were also stellar. The inside was very savory, but the bread was the sweetest I've ever had, which actually enhanced the flavors even more. Sweet AND savory!

The larger set-up is also appreciated. I felt very cramped in Momocho the few times I've been inside the restaurant (eaten outside), so it was nice to have enough space and to see across the table. It was pretty for Sunday dinner, so I can't comment on the noise level. The only downside would be that almost all the tables have really high chairs. It doesn't bother me, but my dad and my mom both felt like their circulation was being cut off and kept standing up. I think I saw some low tables on the other side of the bar, so I'll ask for those next time because I think it did take away form their experience.

But overall, a fabulous place. Wonderful blend of tastes and none of the food items overpower each other. Good cooking isn't just being creative, it's blending flavors in a balanced way and El Carnicero does not disappoint when it comes to the creative and the delicious."}
{"text":"I've never had a disappointing meal here, although some of my experiences were better than others. Most recently, I came in on a Saturday night for dinner with a large group of friends. My friend L handled making a reservation ahead of time, and mentioned that they were very easy to work with. We ended up having a whole dining area to ourselves (it was a party of 25-30), and our own bar. I would have liked if the staff could have made it more clear that we were a private party as early in the night (initially we had 5-6 of us there), we kept having random people try to sit with us. And every single one of them ignored us when we politely tried to tell them that we were a private party - the bartender had to tell most of them more than once. 

We showed up early, and let the staff know if they were not ready for us, we could wait in the main area. The (rather good looking) bartender let us know that it was okay with him, if we were okay that he wasnt' fully set up yet. We were only about 30 min early, but for the next hour plus, half of the drinks he made, he had to go to the main bar. I'm not sure what that was about. We had our friends coming in waves, so hopefully we didn't overwhelm him. There wasn't quite enough room for us at the tables that they had set up, so several of us ended up sitting at the bar (which was perfectly fine with us, but i know some of our friends were a little disappointed). A few staff occasionally came over to help out Hot Bartender, but he mostly handled us on his own.

There were a few snafus with checks, but overall everyone seemed happy. The food was great, although several people had to repeatedly ask for their appetizers (including guacamole which honestly should not have taken about an hour to arrive). We probably had better service sharing one bartender for 30 people than i have on most other occasions (a recent dining out included me drinking my margarita, my water, and then going to get my drinks from the bar because I literally couldn't get my server's attention for almost an hour). 

The margaritas are awesome, although my friend was disappointed that they did not have frozen ones. The blood orange and pepper ones were my favorite. And definitely go for the mole sauce!"}
{"text":"Who knew a mod mex restaurant would have the best Friday fish fry in town?! We've been to El Carnicero several times to enjoy their regular, and quite delicious, menu including amazing guacamole and margaritas, but we just tried their fish fry and it was incredible! It came with 3 large and perfectly beer batter fried fish and still  delivered Latin flavor with chimichurri sauce on the fries, garnished with cilantro, and a chipotle dipping sauce that had just the right amount of heat. We brought our 3yr old son who had kids chicken fingers and fries, also tasty. 

Our server was great and everyone was super nice. Pretty sure we'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"wild boar nachos and a classic margarita. yes. delicious."}
{"text":"I don't often review restaurants but I have to say how wonderful our experience was! We made a last minute decision to have a late dinner at El Carnicero last Friday. When we arrived it was a little after 8 and there was a wait so we went to the back bar. Even though there were no seats directly at the bar, the bartender came out to us along the wall and we had beers and margaritas in no time. (My favorite is the Blood Orange with the sugar rim!) Two seats opened at the bar and just minutes after we sat down, the table was ready. The huge wooden bar is impressive and the atmosphere was really fun. 

For food we placed an order of guac to start with- goat cheese, chile pablano, and tomato. It was spicy and delicious. We ordered the chorizo tomale and the pork belly taquitos. We argued over whose dish was better! The pork belly dish was topped with crispy pork skins, perfect combination. 

Overall the service was outstanding, the food was delicious, and we didn't do too much damage to the checkbook. I'm so excited to have El Canicero in Lakewood. While the wrestling masks and some menu items are very reminiscent of Momocho, El Carnicero still feels very fresh and new!"}
{"text":"Yeah buddy! Loved this place. Went on a quiet Tuesday night for a friend's birthday dinner, so maybe that's why it seemed rather un-lively. Still, though, I was super impressed with the food and service. Great, super-fresh Mexican food in a fun atmosphere (probably the nicest collection of luchador masks I've seen in the Midwest). Tons o' beer on tap as well."}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times and enjoyed both experiences.  Like other yelpers have said, it's Momocho, but bigger and with tamales!  The atmosphere is great and the service is very good.  We've only come for lunch and never had to wait for a table.  Yesterday I started with a margarita sampler (spicy mango, cucumber, and grapefruit).  The mango was the best but they were all delicious.  We tried the poblano pepper guac for an appetizer which was good, but could use a bit more lime.  If you like spicy food, ask for a bottle of their hot sauce.  It's so delicious, we almost always finish it.  I wanted to get a tamale for my meal, but their vegetarian one currently has raisins and since I equate eating raisins to eating dead bugs, I decided to get the roasted beet taquito instead, which was good.  Next time I'll try the cumin carrot with mole one, unless they have a tamale without dead bugs.  The carnivorous husband did get a tamale sans dead bugs, which he loved.   Also of note, they sell their hot sauce to take home, so score!"}
{"text":"Wanted to try a new Mexican restaurant and decided to come here. As far as ambiance goes, the place doesn't really lack in that department as they've chosen to go with Spanish wrestlers or Lucha Libre as its known in Mexico. We started off with a guacamole tradicional which was good but not great, for me it lacked a little flavor. Possibly more cilantro can liven it up. I decided to try the Barriga Taquito which was a huge disappointment.  They advertise chicharones and I'm almost positive, whatever that was came out of a bag as apposed to the actual animal. My wife ordered the Costilla Tamales and my daughter ordered the Machaca Taquitos and I was able to try their dishes and they were actually pretty good. The service was great and the staff very attentive."}
{"text":"Tamales are for festive occasions.  El Carnicero's version are just as authentic as the ones I bought from street vendors outside the cathedral in downtown San Jose, CA after a Mariachi mass.   

The masa filled tamale I ordered oozed with cheese and peppers and was served steamy hot!   Yum.  Add a golden margarita, green beans and you'll feel festive too.  I'll be back to try other tamales.

Holly had her #1 favorite dish in the world...Machaca taquitos.  There is always enough for her to enjoy them again at home for lunch.

As for the rest of the menu.  It's filled with favorites from Momocho, one of our favorite restaurants, and new entries we can't wait t try.  We will be back, often!"}
{"text":"A+ for food flavor. D+ for service. 
Half of the food was cold and it took foreeeeveer to come out."}
{"text":"Have to drop a star after coming here with a big group yesterday, The service was awful. Our waiter probably only checked on us once. We had to ask other people working to send him over so we could order our food! However, We did enjoy a very delicious dinner here and the guac was to die for! I've never had guacamole with goat cheese in it and it was AMAZING!!! Who knew it would be a great combo!  I'm so glad we decided to try it. I had the classic margarita which was also pretty good. A bit pricey at $8 a pop but otherwise a good choice.

I loved how big the space is inside the restaurant and how the tables are nicely spread out. Very cool d√©cor everywhere as well. For my entr√©e I ordered the Tinga, aka the chicken taquitos. They were good but only served with salsa which was disappointing. I was hoping for at least a side of lettuce or cabbage to add to my corn tortilla.

I think this place is great for a date night or to go with a group. The prices are a little steep but the quality is good. I think it's definitely more about quality than quantity and this place hits the nail on the coffin!"}
{"text":"Yet again, delicious!  Tonight, our server Savanna was AWESOME!  Salsa sampler, margarita samplers and every side dish on the menu- delicious!  More than enough food for three hungry foodies and a to go bag full of goodies!"}
{"text":"My husband, myself and our 6 month old daughter went here in September for the first time. The place is very nice and the decorations did not disappoint. It is almost identical to Momocho (owner's other restaurant) but bigger and somehow fancier.
The food was very good, just like Momocho, and the plates were quite large. My husband and I said later that we should have shared one plate. 
We would go back and take friends. It was a nice atmosphere and the food was good, albeit a little pricey."}
{"text":"I had been meaning to check this place out for months before I made it. Needless to say I was excited and knew it wasn't your standard Mexican-American fare. We got the goat cheese guac to start. It was decent, but not amazing unless you're used to buying packaged guacamole instead of making it fresh. In my opinion the bite of the goat cheese was really overpowering, but that's just me. 

I got the short rib tamales per my servers advice and I have to say I enjoyed them a lot. My mom got the chicken tacos and we both found them to be extremely bland. With our drinks (Sprite and iced tea) we ended up with a $50 bill which to only like one out of three things is a little disappointing. 

I think I would go back for the happy hour to try some of the margs, but for the price I'm not really interesting in eating here for dinner again"}
{"text":"We went last weekend and it was an enjoyable experience. I wish they had the blue cheese guacamole! Drinks were fantastic. I highly recommend the blood orange margarita (or the cucumber, which is very refreshing). It's a bit pricey for the area and what you get. I had the chorizo tamales, which were decent. Next time I may try and egg on top. It was over an hour wait for a table, but there were plenty of seats at the bar and you can order everything on the menu there as well."}
{"text":"Please visit this restaurant, you won't be disappointed. The happy hour has some great prices! The food was amazing, and the gauc was well worth the trip itself! The place is Mod-Mex and the owner is there working hard! He will seat you or he will clear your table, that shows me he cares about his places! He also owns Momocho! So please plan a date night here or dinner with friends!"}
{"text":"If you want to try the most amazing guacamole you've ever had, this is the place to go.  I've been to El Carnicero at least three times and each time they've exceeded my expectations.  There's nothing about this place that I don't like.  The food is amazing!  The tacos are flavorful, the tamales are cooked to perfection, the salsa is well balanced, the margaritas are perfect, and the guacamole is addicting.  The ambiance is great and the restaurant is nicely decorated.  If you have a wrestling fan in your family (like me), this is a must visit as they have a nice collection of Mexican mascaras.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere to pair creative margaritas and great food. The Machaca is the best entree. I also highly recommend the Mexican coffee."}
{"text":"This food is so flavorful! I wish we lived in Cleveland so I could eat here more often. The guacamole game is hella strong. Goat cheese guacamole! Boom, mind blown. Just eat here and be full and happy."}
{"text":"We came here on the 2nd night since opening. Busy, but not too long of a wait. Somewhat louder than I would prefer. We sat at the bar to watch the Indians game, and off the bat were served cucumber margaritas with chili lime salt which is something I fell in love with first at Momocho. We ordered the Guacamole with sesame, orange and chile-habenaro. It was spicy but delicious! 

The kitchen was backed up so we waited awhile for our entrees however the margaritas were good enough to allow us to forget all of that. I ordered the coffee and ancho braised beef brisket tamale and my companion ordered the chorizo tamale. I tasted both and they were amazing. I couldn't finish all of mine unfortunately but definitely ate all of the meat despite how stuffed I felt. None of that was going to waste. Our bartender/server was super nice, and all of the diners around us seemed as though they were having a great time.

Love Momocho, and as El Carnicero is similar, I love this place. I will definitely be returning, and am elated that something so delicious is so close to home."}
{"text":"My friend and I were planning to go to momocho on a Saturday night but since we didn't make a reservation and didn't want to do a walk-in if we have to wait. So we decided to come here.  It was pretty busy and The parking lot in the back didn't have enough spaces so we had to park on the street but it was not difficult to find parking for us. 

We ordered the guacamole sampler which had the traditional/trout+bacon/crab.  They were all very tasty and chunky.  But I couldn't really tell them apart based on the taste besides The little spicy flavor in the crab guacamole.  I ordered the chancho tamales and my friend had the barriga taquito.  They were both kind of salty.  The barriga was good and flavorful but I guess my friend didn't like it so she stopped eating after a few tries.  The tamales were not what I expected.  The portion was big and it was good but not outstanding.  The first time I had tamales was in Arizona made by Mexican families and they were better than the one I had this time."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I love this place!! I've been a fan of Momochos in Ohio City for a while now so when they opened this place on the west side I was ecstatic!! The goat cheese guac and cucumber margs are my favorite menu items and you really can't go wrong with any of the taquitos.  We've never had a bad server/bartender there.  Wish Kelly still bartended there!  She was amazing and knew our orders right away.  Bartenders like that always impress me."}
{"text":"This is pretty much a west-side outpost of Momocho -- fancified gringo-ish Mexican that's interesting and quite tasty. The food is good and pretty creative, but it's also fairly expensive. We had really great service on our visit. I'll probably return at some point, but there are a lot of cheaper ways to scratch my Latino food itch on the west side."}
{"text":"The flavors that this Mexican restaurant has are amazing! I got the Queso Fundido first. I thought it was really weird because it didn't look like the type of Queso I'm used to but it was so good. For dinner I got the Al Pastor Taquito and I liked that it wasn't just one taco. It was a plate with the pork and you make your own tacos. It's enough for more than 5 tacos so the prices are worth it. Again the flavors were outstanding! They had $5 margaritas or you could get a flight of 3 different ones that they have for $15. I just got the one margarita. I would recommend this place for sure. Great service and delicious food!"}
{"text":"Went with great expectations, left with great disappointment. Started with a margarita that should have been a warning of what was to come. My complaint to the waiter informed me they used Lemix. The signature drink for a Mexican restaurant tasted like a can of cheap soda. My wild boar was poorly seasoned, the 16 spiced chicken overcooked to dry and stringy, the braised beef brisket barely acceptable, but the pork belly and spinach was very good even though the pork belly was chewy. The kitchen needs some talent. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Had the guacamole and goat cheese which was absolutely delicious and creamy! I ordered the machaca and pork belly tacos.  The machaca wasn't that good to me.  I felt like it was a little too salty to my liking.  The pork belly in the other hand was so delicious and crunchy with a lot of flavor!  Would definitely come back for the appetizer and pork belly!"}
{"text":"Great food, great ingredients, fun loud enough atmosphere. The happy hour nachos are very good. The guacamole is yum, fresh, and proper consistency (not runny or pasty) Recently tried the pork belly tacos and they were incredible. Kid friendly."}
{"text":"Service 2.5/5
Food 4.5/5

We ended up here from a google search of Mexican food in Lakewood. One of the best Mexican restaurants I've eaten at. 

We sat at the bar so I wasn't really expecting phenomenal service, but the bartender taking car of us messed up and never even placed my girlfriend's order. 

We started out with the goat cheese guac and brussel sprouts. The guac was some of the best I've ever had, better than Barrio by far. 

I ordered the short rib tamale and my girlfriend got the mahi mahi taquito, which we didn't end up getting to try. 

We just ended up sharing my plate rather than waiting for them to make hers from scratch and it actually ended up being enough food for two (with the appetizers). We both thought the short rib was phenomenal though and I would definitely recommend El Carnicero."}
{"text":"damn, this is so fine
creative mexican twists
bravo chef williams!

If you like Taco Bell for any reason other than a \"cleanse\", this is not the place.  If you like mexican with a brilliant creative spin, and one that really works, this is the place.  Helluva margarita too.

Carry on, and eat tacos."}
{"text":"As someone who has never experienced the joy of Momocho, I can only speak for this restaurant's offerings. 

To make things simple, I loved the atmosphere, I loved the service, and I loved the food. Overpriced? --But it's enough for leftovers, so I suppose forgivable. I shall return!!"}
{"text":"By far the WORST \"Mexican\" food I have ever eaten. I do not say this lightly because usually I am very open minded about everything. However, everything I had at this restaurant was awful. Lets start with the Pop selection, pretty hard to mess up right? Wrong. I ordered a Diet coke and im not sure if the tap was dirty or the glass but I guarantee you I tasted tequila in my drink.   I wasn't the only one, my boyfriend said he tasted the same! Next lets move on to my queso... Never in my life have I had queso that tasted like I was eating grits. I can't even explain the texture without gagging a little.

 Finally when I went to order I realized I had very limited options. I either needed to get a tamale or taquitos... Neither of which sounded good so I ended up getting a \"Big Plate\" of Carne Asada Fries. When I ordered it I was told by my friend to order my steak 2 up from what I normally like as they under cook. So I ordered Well and the waiter without missing a beat barks at me \"Your going to be waiting awhile!\". I was a little taken aback because I go to a steak house and order it like that and it doesn't take any longer than normal. 

It took well over a hour and a half for the food to get to the table (Wednesday night at 8pm we didn't eat until around 9:30) and mine ended up coming first? Confused I dug right in to find everything was Ice cold! I was so confused, I tried digging around hoping to find a warm piece of meat (Which were burnt to a crisp on the outside and bloody on the inside) or warm fries but  there was no luck. There was barely any sauce on it and the fries tasted freezer burned. 

I honestly do not want others to experience what I did, so that is why I wrote this review. I will be taking my money and tastebuds elsewhere."}
{"text":"So let me start by saying that the first time I ever came here I was not impressed. My boyfriend and I stopped in for happy hour, sat at the bar, and the place was beyond packed. I ordered a margarita ($5 during happy hour) and all I could taste was the mix. Because I was hangry and annoyed at my margarita, we left without eating and went elsewhere. However, we recently decided to give it another try and I am so glad we did!

We stopped by again for happy hour and sat at the bar, but it was MUCH less crowded this time. We both had a $2 modelo and $5 marg and split the pulled pork nachos ($5-all HH prices). The nachos were some of the best I've ever had. There was a cheese sauce on them that I would've drank straight if it had been socially acceptable. 

For our meals, I ordered the machaca tomales (coffee braised beef brisket) and my boyfriend got the al pastor taquitos. Both were very tasty but the tomales were to die for! The second I took my first bite I was so mad at myself for not coming back here sooner. It was enough for 3 meals worth and was just as good left over. 

The service was pretty standard- had probably 3 different people serving us (probably because we were at the bar) so it got a little confusing on who to ask for what, but everyone was friendly and I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"As soon as we walked in I felt like I was in love. The black and white tvs, the wall of luchadores masks, and you could even smell the delicious cuisine. We were greeted by a friendly little lady who sat us at our high top. Now for the service.... While things did honestly start well, they did not continue that way. 

He greeted us and suggested a few drinks on special and such. We got our drinks and were starving so we ordered the verde salsa, amazing and perfectly spiced, and the traditional guac. 

When they arrived it took him a while to come back and take our entree order, which is not a huge deal but also they were not very busy and he had one other table. At the time it really didn't faze me. Another server brought our meals out, I had the Pescado and my boyfriend had the Tinga. The Chicken was so perfectly cooked and spiced and the mahi mahi was very tasty as well.   

However I kind of wanted to add a little extra heat and waited for him to come back so I could ask for hot sauce and/or cilantro. After our meals hit the table we waited for a total of twelve minutes before he even checked back on us, and I promise you this is no exaggeration. I watched him approach the other table directly next to ours four separate times during this wait; took drink orders, refilled waters, joked and laughed. All the while my boyfriend had been out of water for quite some time and I just wanted hot sauce. Finally he noticed us and asked if everything was alright. Not at all. We cashed out, boxed up, still tipped well, and left. 

I am so disappointed especially after everything I heard about this restaurant and don't think I will ever be back. I work in the industry as well, so I do understand a \"bad day\" but this was inexcusable. We both work very hard for our money and would rather spend it somewhere we will actually be taken care of instead of ignored. 

Two generous stars for service and five stars for food."}
{"text":"We have been to El C twice now, so time for a little review! 

The first time we ate here, we had the basic guacamole (just okay) and the pineapple salsa (good). We skipped both on our second visit, deciding they weren't worth the cost. My husband had beef-based tamales and taquitos between the two visits and I had the verdura taquitos each time. We both have really liked our entrees. 
For sides, we have done the jicama and watercress salad, the white rice, and black beans (all good, although the first time we had beans they were really salty). My husband stuck to draft beers and I tried a pomegranate margarita, which was tasty. I rarely drink, but I can't wait to try the other flavors here! 

The space is great and I love the whole vibe of the atmosphere - it is really large inside too. The staff is really nice.

We both really like El C, but agree it is slightly overpriced. Sides of beans and rice should come with the entrees for the current prices. Two good veg entree options for the vegans (along with a few sides) and even more options for the vegetarians."}
{"text":"It's not \"mexican\" food, it's mod-mex.. this isn't Chi-Chi's or your typical mexican place.. It's AWESOME.. The guacamole comes in about 5 different options.. Tamales and taquitios with tons of options, meat, seafood, vegetarian.. great margaritas and tons of seating especially with 2 bars.."}
{"text":"Good, but not to the level of their sister restaurant, momocho. Guacamole is the standout at both places, but momocho has more ambiance and is more flavorful."}
{"text":"I'm a weirdo who eats alone at the bar sometimes and, well, they don't make me feel like a weirdo who eats alone at the bar. 

Margs are very good and I like the chicken dish and salsa."}
{"text":"I am not local and have been here more than a handful of times. The food is above par! The service is phenomenal! Did I mention the food? There are so many unique flavors to chose from and the sauces are to die for. Happy hour is killer."}
{"text":"Stopped into this new restaurant last night for happy hour and I was really impressed. Definitely a more laid back 'bar' vibe than it's sister restaurant Momocho, which I totally didn't mind. I had the $5 sangria and everyone else tried the $5 margarita. The red sangria was good, not overly sweet which I appreciate. We also got the wild boar nachos which was the only happy hour special but just $5. They were the standout here, a huge portion and so much flavor. I would love to come back for dinner but happy hour is so tempting."}
{"text":"Love this place. The menu is great, always something new and fresh. My favorites are...(can't choose just one!)...the goat cheese guacamole, the flight of margaritas, and the lamb taquitos!  Closed Monday's, same menu as Momocho, way more seating."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Mexican place by far!  Everything is so good.  If you go, you have to try the goat cheese guacamole!  My favorite dish is the machaca taquitos which is a beef brisket dish.  The side of corn is also excellent.  The only thing that I have had that I didn't care for was the fish fry.  A blood orange margarita with a sugar rim is a must have as well!"}
{"text":"We've been to El Carnicero many to times, and consistently rate it as one of the best in Cleveland. The Mexican wrestling masks, the great food, and the fabulous margaritas are what make it a top contender. We started with the smoked Gouda queso, as well as the goat cheese guac. Stunning and delicious! For our main course, we ordered the Camarones Taquitos, which are just to die for. Add to that a couple of Margaritas (blood orange for her, Hibiscus for me), and you have a satisfying night out at a fantastic restaurant. The service tonight by Savanah and Andrew was on fleek!"}
{"text":"Basically fancy chi chis, Momocho is still somehow better? I prefer Bomba or Barrio just because they update their menus more often then El C. Margaritas here are awesome and it's super cool inside, would be good for large parties."}
{"text":"My new favorite spot in town!

Visited this establishment on Saturday July, 27 and it was amazing! The staff was very friendly and welcoming. Our server was very helpful with recommendations for dinner. One of the great features is there is a parking lot right behind this restaurant so parking is a breeze. The food was amazing! We had a bunch of appetizers since we wanted to try a variety of things. The goat cheese guacamole was amazing, as expected from Momocho in Ohio City. We also had a pumpkin salsa that was very different but delicious.  We also had the salmon which was perfectly cooked with a  very spicy sauce on top. 

The decor was very pleasant and the whole restaurant was very spacious

Overall, I would return here every weekend if I could! I highly recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"Best margaritas you'll ever have, anywhere!  My favorites are pomegranate and blood orange, but the bartender let me try a little shot of the rooster claw--delicious, but spicy!  The goat cheese guacamole is also to die for. Everything is absolutely delicious."}
{"text":"El Carnicero is the perfect example of when a restaurant has a cult of personality - this joint gets mad hype but only because it's trendy and different,and the hipsters love it - in my opinion.  On the surface, this place seems awesome - lucha libre theme, 'authentically' billed Mexican food (ie, no quesodillas, chalupas, etc.) and great trendy branding.
        However, after a dinner here it becomes clear that it's all hype and people buying into it.  My fiancee and friends and I were really excited to go here.  The menu includes many meal items that I haven't found outside of Arizona and I was stoked.  Though, the meals that each of us got was extremely disappointed.   Our friends asked the waitress how big the taco meal was and she said it was big enough to share, which they decided to do.  Though, when it was delivered, there were a measly number of very small tortillas and barely enough 'components' to mix into it for one person, let alone two - spoiler alert, they left hungry.  Our friend even asked 'wait, is this it?' when their meal arrived...  
         My fiancee and I each got meals for ourselves, which, again, weren't enough for one person to be satisfied.  Beyond that, however, the meals hid 'flavor' for heat and were excessive in spice (again, I lived off authentic Mexican food in AZ and love some good spice and heat, not an excessive amount of spices and heat masquerading as  'flavor').
       The guac, however was spectacular - highly recommend the smoked salmon and other guacs...if all you go here for is that and beer.  
     Overall, extremely over-rated and over-hyped place that isn't worth anything close to the price.  Filiberto's side street fast-Mexican food in the Southwest does a better job than this place.  As an end-kicker for how bad and disappointing our experience was here - the four of us ended up going to another restaurant nearby afterwords.  Cleveland is home to alot of amazing Mex/TexMex joints - so skip the hipster joint El Carnicero and check out another place."}
{"text":"Just enjoyed a spaghetti squash tamale and it was outstanding!  The combination of ingredients is like a party in your mouth.  The two sauces make the best combination and add the heat I am looking for in Mexican food! Great service, too!  Friendly and informative.  Get the goat cheese guacamole and salsa chiltomate!  Also, the tamales come in pairs, so one order is enough to share if you're not a starving girl!  Boys - you will probably be able to eat both!"}
{"text":"Best guacamole I've had in Cleveland.  And they have some seasonal specials I really like.  It's a great place for winter- cozy atmosphere.  No patio for summer though.  I will definitely visit again."}
{"text":"My husband and I are huge fans of Momocho and decided to check out El Carnicero after giving it a couple weeks to work out opening kinks. We went on a Saturday during happy hour (yay--happy hour daily!) and sat at the bar. We took advantage of the drink specials ($5 traditional marg and $2 cans of Modelo). Our bartender was very enthusiastic and excellent at up-selling, which we didn't mind--we were there to explore and try new things. We ordered the salmon guac and sikil pak (delicious). We decided to go with tamales, since we've had a good number of the taquitos at Momocho. We tried the chorizo and short ribs--both excellent. I really enjoyed the tamales--the masa was light and not too sweet. Both meat toppings were well prepared and flavorful. Each entr√©e comes with two tamales, one with a verde sauce and the other with a smoky red--I really loved the verde. We also ordered the pork belly beans, which was the only miss of our evening. They were awful--really, really exceptionally awful. They were so salty we could hardly eat them. I tasted zero pork belly, and aside from the salt, they were so overly spiced you could almost feel the powdery texture of the spices on your tongue (not good). I was also missing the kitsch of Momocho. While the wrestling masks are still present at El Carnicero, it's surprisingly sterile. I hope to see some art hung on the walls soon. Overall, though, really great food. Great service. And I know it will become a regular haunt for us."}
{"text":"I have been here before and really enjoyed the food and atmosphere. This time: no. Our group of five waited 1 hour and 42 minutes to NOT be seated. We had called ahead to \"put our name down\" because they don't take reservations. When we arrived, we were told it would be 30 minutes. Then, we were consistently told it would be just a little bit longer, so we didn't order an food at the bar. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"I came in with my boyfriend for lunch when we were in the area because of the Yelp rating. My Yelp friends rarely let me down when it comes to new places, but... I'm just not feeling this place as much as everyone else. 

So... We both really liked the cool, casual vibe of the space and art... I guess maybe we were expecting that cool, casual vibe to extend to the menu and prices. 

We both thought the food and service was okay. We each ordered an entr√©e (I got a tamale, he got tacos) and beans, a side of rice to share, chips and salsa, and a shared margarita sampler (the highlight of the meal)... It came to $70 with a tip. That is one pricey lunch!

Overall, it was just okay, and I don't think we'd go out of our way to try it again."}
{"text":"Wicked Delicious! Need I say more!? Awesome staff good food and great drinks. I highly recommend the cucumber margarita!"}
{"text":"Should have taken the hint while walking in when one couple whispered \"this place is terrible\" and we saw another guy hunched over dry heaving behind a ford explorer in the parking lot. Nevertheless, we were in the mood for Mexican food, so we wandered our way into El Carnicero. Initial vibes were very strong, cool, trendy Mexican decor and the place was packed. Luckily (or unluckily) we were able to snag some seats at the bar where we were handed menus and waters. So far so good. Little did I know that a mere four hours later I'd be rolling around in bed, sweating, pondering whether or not I had actually just eaten someone's vomit. 

We started off by ordering some guacamole and queso.  By any stretch those are two pretty safe orders at a Mexican restaurant.  We also placed orders for some of their flavored margaritas. One friend asked if they could do any margaritas spicy other than the mango and his head whipped around faster than the girl in The Exorcist to snap \"no. Mango is the only spicy one.\"  The drinks took a few minutes to prepare, which was strange because I leaned over to see two bartenders comparing the curls on their mustaches while pouring our margs out of a jug.  Usually concerning for pre-mixed cocktails, especially for the $9 price tag, but we'd give it a try.  Low and behold it was like drinking a Capri Sun. Six of these things couldn't even get JonBenet tipsy. Disappointed and frustrated, we hoped the food would redeem our experience.  

We had some questions about the menu but we did not see our server for over 15 minutes.  This was odd since he had to know we'd have questions about their menu which toted 2 tamales for $16 and butternut squash + goat cheese flautas.  A runner brought our guac first and said the queso would be a few minutes (ended up being over 10). Famished, we place an oder for the queso fundido with him since our our server was doing his best Amanda Berry impression and hadn't been seen in years. The guacamole was actually decent, and is the reason for the 1 star on the review. Good job, guac maker. 

After finishing that, still no sign of our waiter, Capri Suns running low and needing refills on our waters for 20 mins, the queso arrives.  And oh man did it arrive.  The first person took a scoop and without saying anything immediately ran to the bathroom. Then my other friend and I simultaneously sampled it and both nearly vomited. The 4th friend tried it, and gasping for air like Dumbledore trying to destroy a horcrux begged her boyfriend not to put the wretched elixir to his lips.  I don't really know how to put into words the experience but I will try.  It's consistency was that of water, but somehow with more liquidity. The taste was as if they put a block of cheese in a bowl and the entire staff took turns mashing it with their bare feet, only to then melt it with a bleach flavored candle. Without having to even speak to one another (the one friend had yet to return from the bathroom) we knew we had to leave. 

Miraculously our server appeared out of nowhere with a Joker like smile on his face, almost as if he had just finished rubbing his nuts across table 12's upcoming queso order, and asked \"how is everything?\"  I told him point blank that things were worse than ever, we hadn't seen him in what felt like an hour and that we would like to leave.  I told him to charge us for whatever he thought was fair, and without offering an apology or asking why my friend's face was puke green, he returned with the bill saying \"I just charged you for the guacamole since it looks like you guys liked that.\" He meant he charged us for the guacamole and the juice box margaritas, and graciously did not charge us for the foot soup. Again, no apology or opportunity for cure, just a smirk and a \"have a great one.\"  At that moment the runner came over (in what I thought was one of the luca libre masks hanging from the wall, but it might have just been some sort of hallucinogenic side effect of the toxic cheese juice) to say \"alrighttttyyy queso FUNNNdidooo\" handing us a panned concoction that looked like someone shat themselves after 3 chili dogs and 14 beers at a preseason Browns game. 

Holding back vomit we paid and left.  Not a word was said in the car ride home, not even sure if we grabbed our friend from the bathroom, he might still be there.  I read some of the other reviews before penning this, and either they have gone entirely pallet deaf, or we were on some sort of candid camera game show to see how much fucked up food we would eat before dying or leaving, but holy shit I don't know if I'll ever literally or figuratively get that taste out of my mouth.  If you value your life, and the lives of the ones around you, do not go here. I beg you."}
{"text":"Came for a birthday party in which everyone was willing to share, so I was fortunate enough to try many of the offerings. The margarita flight is a great way to try a variety of their unique margaritas.  The cucumber was refreshing and delicious. If you are not a big cucumber fan, it might not be for you, however. The cucumber flavor is not subtle.  I love the Rooster Claw; sweet mango paired with spicy pepper= yum!  The pomegranate was just okay.  My husband loved the hibiscus. A little boring to me, though. 

My guess is you can't go wrong with any of the guacamole picks. We tried the goat cheese: creamy and wonderful. Smoked salmon and corn: smoky and tasty, but after awhile, I got a little salmoned-out.  Tortilla chips were fresh, crunchy perfection.

I was less pleased with the entrees.  I tried both the wild boar tamale and the ground lamb taquito with mint and walnuts. My husband loved the wild boar tamale, but both dishes reminded me of Indian food. Over-seasoned to the point of having a circus gone amok in my mouth, and not in a good way. Just toooo much. The boar was very tender, but the spices overpowered. The lamb was very, very salty. And I like salt!  I must say though, that I liked it a bit better the next day, eating leftovers. The side of brussel sprouts with bacon and coconut oil, however, were delightful. Probably my favorite part of the meal, and I might just be ruined for any other way of preparing them.  We also tried the fries, which were delicious. Standard thin cut, but with a yummy sauce drizzled on them. 

The service was great.  Our server was gracious, polite, patient, quick, and well-informed about the menu."}
{"text":"Not your typical American Mexican restaurant.  Not a \"cheese 
covered\" place like most of them.   Food had a lot of flavor
to it.  Fairly spicy.
Many vegan sides to choose from. Sides were fairly priced.
The tamales seemed to represent more of a dinner as far
as portions go. 
Very nice presentation.  Service good. 
Inside decor is casual and comfortable, yet cool enough
for a date.  
One thing I did not like: Prices eating at the bar were
cheaper during happy hour than if you sat at a table.
Including beer and drinks. Not fair in my book.
This place is ok for a special occasion.  Not a restaurant 
I would go to on a regular basis."}
{"text":"This is my second time coming here for dinner ! I actually came in a really good night because they had free pork nachos due to their anniversary event  night. They also had $5 margaritas and $2 modelo cans which is offered during happy hours as well. The pork nachos was alright but I got an side of papa fritas to begin with . They were delicious fries with chimichurri  sauce and queso! I thought the fries were a perfect combination with those two sauces! It was like eating Tex-mex style fries! I would definitely get it again ! For dinner I ordered the chicken tinga tacos which came with chicken in a skewer, grilled vegetables, and their corn tortillas ! The chicken had a good amount of flavor and the corn tortillas was alright! I would prefer if they had options of choosing between hard or soft corn tortillas! I only got the la colifor tamale which is a cauliflower tamale dish. I ordered a side of black beans and creamed corn as well! This dish was very very flavorful! Perfect amount of flavor and spice to eat with the dish alone! This was one of my favorite! The tamale came in a deep fried ball and I wasn't very big fan of that! But then again I am not a big fan of tamales in general. The black beans were good nothing too special and the creamed corn was good ! Overall the atmosphere is causal and the bartenders/service was attentive and good ! There are certain dishes I would definitely  come back for and would also like to venture out to more !"}
{"text":"I have to say I'm surprised that so far the best fish fry we have had so far has been here. I had a little more faith in the churches around me but oh well. The batter on this fish was kinda crispy but surprisingly good. The fish itself was awesome. Super flaky and firm. The fries it came with were seasoned with garlic and cilantro. We had a margarita sampler wish included a mango, spicy red pepper, and a hibiscus. I liked the mango the best however they tasted like that all came from a premade mix which was too sweet. The service here could have been a little better. Everyone seemed to have a gotten into a fight with each other or something before we got there. Other than that we had a great dining experience. Will definitely be back in the future to try some new things."}
{"text":"There is a Mexican rapper from Houston, TX by the name of Chingo Bling. He raps about immigration issues, his pet rooster Cleto and most importantly, making tamales. His album Tamale Kingpin is a classic. I went to happy hour hoping for price relief. I was sad to see the only food item on special is the wild boar nachos for $5. They were worth double. The service was outstanding and the bartender was as friendly as they come. This restaurant is still haunted by the ghosts of the bar that used to be here (McCarthy's). Or as Tom Waits said, The Ghosts of Saturday Night. They serve Sangria. Jerry Jeff Walker would be proud.

Took my mom here for Lenten Fish Fry / her birthday and had a wonderful meal. This is a great addition to Lakewood."}
{"text":"Really good fresh food. Great service and ambiance. A little pricey for what you get, but hey, that's the way it is. Will be back again for sure."}
{"text":"We celebrated a friend's birthday here and had a wonderful experience. I reserved the semi private room with the family style table that seat 13-15 people people.  The guests were a mix of vegans, gluten free, adventurous foodies to the meat and potatoes safe eaters. Everyone was  thrilled with their meals!  The vegans called ahead and the chef even made them a special meal. The service was great, the food was great and the space is one i would definitely recommend for bigger groups.  The icing on the cake was that they even split the check without us asking."}
{"text":"The guacamole is amazing. My husband, who hates avocado, even enjoyed it. I had the citrus and adobo pork tamale and he had the ancho chili beef tamale. Both were fabulous! Both were flavorful and the meat was succulent."}
{"text":"If I could give El Carnicero zero stars, I would. As a huge fan of Mexican cuisine, I was thrilled to try this place out with my fianc√© and some friends. However, my excitement very quickly turned into annoyance and disappointment soon after we ordered our food.

Instead of one long rant (although this fad place does deserve it), I'll sum up our dining experience simply: Tiny portions of 'food' (if you think tacos involve just meat and salsa, and don't even get me started on the dime-sized tortillas that aren't big enough to hold said meat and salsa), extremely overly flavored to seem fresh, chips for purchase (like, really?), and a $45 bill for two meals....and another $45 spent at Harry Buffalo right after we left this place because we were still starving after our 'meals,' which can be better summed up as extremely overpriced apps. 

If you're trying this place out because you heard it has a great reputation, please do yourself and your wallet a favor and skip this schtick. I wish I had."}
{"text":"Chef/Owner Eric Williams was on-site and ensured we were seated ASAP despite a full house and managed front of house experience-someone who gets it!  Get off your couch and support this business.  Incredible brisket tamales and smoked trout tostada and the Cabo Wabo Blanco that threw me back to Sammy and Eddie circa 2006.  Strong effort that will keep me coming back...-Topher Adams Cleveland Against The World!"}
{"text":"Here for a private party in the back area. 
Small diet Coke & Barcardi, $8! 
The guac was very good.
The flautas/rolled & fried tortillas were also good.
But the rice and black beans, lackluster.
Two types of wings served: dont know flavors but one with a rub tasted like it had cinnamon (not on my wings!),  the other was good."}
{"text":"I went to El Carnicero on a Tuesday. While El C didn't have any Taco Tuesday specials, happy hour runs from open at 4 PM through 7 PM. You must sit at the bar. While I was there from a bit after 5 through 6:30, there were plenty of bar seats to pick from.

Happy hour got me a good $5 classico margarita and $5 wild boar nachos. Overall $6.50 in savings. I'd never had boar before....it tasted like pork. The nachos were a good serving size and were easily split among three people. They had a nice, mild melted cheese over them. 

For my main I ordered machaca; this was from the taquitos section of the menu. The tacos are served in make your own style. Truly soft and warm corn corn tortillas are provided for you to add the meat and sauces too. I loved the spicy salsa verde. The meat was beef brisket. It was well seasoned and tender and I would order the dish again. The portion was very generous. While listed on the menu, coffee was not a prominent flavor that I tasted in the dish. 

I've been working my way around town for Tacos the past four weeks or so and to date this place is at the top of the list, though more pricey than the other places I have been."}
{"text":"The was an hour and half waiting list to get into this place on a Friday night.  Seems someone way ahead to get you a seat on the weekend!"}
{"text":"Like the modern vibe and decorations of the restaurant, will give it a 5/5 on its vibe.
Had a great friendly server and not so good hostess (4.5/5) for service
My husband and I both agree that the food was just alright. (3/5)
We ordered the guacamole sampler of 3 different flavors for 18.50. The guacamole was a best part of the meal.
We also ordered a wild boar tamale and beef brisket taquitos. Not impressed and not worth the price. Had much better tamale and taquitos for half the price!"}
{"text":"On Tuesday (1/6/15), I made my third visit to El Carnicero hoping my experience would be significantly better than the previous two visits where I had recieved some of the worst dinning service at a Mexican restaurant I can remember especially considering I drop over 100 dollars here on ever visit.  But my experience was similarly as shitty as my previous visit which is a shock because I love love Eric Williams (Momocho & happy dog).  I have waited now over a half hour to recieve my bill when requested it last two visits and there were about a total of 15 people dinning.

Although the service is terrible,  Eric 's ugly step-child  does have some decent dishes the guac (a Momocho stample) delivered as expect as did the Brussel spouts with pig bellie but the Chicken dish I order was greatly over cooked as we're the El Pastor tamales.  The refried beans and black beans were terrible, tasted dirty and we're poorly seasoned, which is a bummer because I love beens.  That all being said I made my gf promise to never allow me to return after my 3rd visit here plus it's very over priced for the service and food quality...Save yourself the pain I felt and head to Momocho or hell the Mexican Grocery Store,  La Plaza, will deliver better food/service ratio then this place does.  Sorry Eric but this place hurts your name!"}
{"text":"Love a bartender (Carrie) that knows her drinks. Without having to look at the list, I talked to her about what I like and she matched me with a great tequila.  Got a lamb tamale and it all made for a great Sunday lunch!  They made me feel welcomed. Very comfortable place and Browns were on the tube. Good stop."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness- This place was amazing! The food was fabulous, atmosphere was fun and seri e was good (not great).  

I had the wild boar nachos and they were perfectly done. Not too much cheese so my chips didn't get soggy. They just had the perfect blend of ingredients. And it was Gouda cheese! I also had one of their taquito platter - haha I might be saying this wrong- but the coffee cured beef was so so good and I would have been completely satisfied, but then I had someone's pork belly - and it was to die for! 

The atmosphere was fun with the Mexican wrestlers from the 60s decorating the walls. They even had masks that my group had fun playing with. Dare you leave the room, someone would jump out and scare you with the mask. Haha I'm sure the restaurant didn't appreciate it but we were away from the public in a private room. And that's another thing- they easily accommodated out large group on a week night at the last minute. 

Only thing I would say is that my drink was dry a few times, but he did a good job for our group."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant. Well, possibly a close second to Momocho :) We go quite regularly and are impressed to see Chef Eric Williams running around there most of the time. 

Every margarita, every guacamole, every main dish, every side, and every special we've ever had here are incredible, I recommend it all.

Top recommendations: Orange Sesame Guac, Cuke Margs, Rooster Claw Margs, Wild Boar Taquitos, & the fries

The atmosphere here is also my favorite: hopping, yet intimate. And service is ALWAYS great, it's obvious they're a customer focused group."}
{"text":"0 complaints!

Started with happy hour and the white sangria was awesome. We were a group of 14 so we called ahead and had no problems making a reservation, even though it was only an hour in advance.

We ordered guacamole and salsa samplers to start. Guacs included traditional, goat cheese, pineapple and crab. The goat cheese guac was by far the table favorite, although they were all really great and fresh. Salsas were pepito, tomatillo and habanero and they were all good too (I'm not a salsa person, so I gravitated to the guacamole).

For my dinner, I ordered the machacha tacos with (white) rice and black beans and it was awesome. The meat was SO flavorful and the rice also had a great seasoned situation happening (lime and cilantro, probably). My friend ordered the barriga (pork belly) tacos and I was SO jealous after trying a piece. Probably the best bite of the whole night.

And...surprisingly...the coffee my friend ordered (that I tried, of course!) was incredible too. Apparently they coat the pot in a brown sugar so it's a black coffee but has an awesome, smooth flavor to it. Highly recommend. 

5/5. Would go again and again!"}
{"text":"St. Patrick's Day is a great day to go to a Mexican restaurant for a Lent fish fry!  There was no wait on a Friday night when the place is usually swamped.  
Took advantage of happy hour deals at the bar while waiting for the gang to arrive.  Pork nachos, vegetable empanadas, and festive bright green classic margaritas were all specially priced.  In addition, I snagged a $10 margarita flight with the CLEseats app.  The flight was the highlight of the night for sure!  I chose the cucumber, spicy mango and blood orange flavors.  All were so good!
The appetizers quickly disappeared so they were good choices.  We all ordered the Latino fish fry special.  You may ask what is a Latino fish fry?  Well it is beer battered cod with Chipotle tartar sauce and chimichurri-drizzled french fries.  Of course they use Dos Equis for the batter.  For the little ones we ordered rice, beans, quac and chips.  Great choices for toddler meals. Top notch quality ingredients used for the food and drinks make for a great experience."}
{"text":"Came with my husband on a Saturday night, early. Seated right away. 

Started with a margarita flight to share - blood orange, pomagranite, and traditional. Salt on the rim. The traditional was my favorite. Who doesn't love a good margarita?

Goat cheese guac +salsa chiltomate. Guac was delicious and totally fresh, but a bit pricey (but I already knew that, thanks yelpers). Chips were also nice and fresh tasting. 

Entrees arrived so fast! Pavo tamales, two per serving (again a bit pricey, would be great if you got 3 per plate). But the mole sauce on there was AWESOME. I'm a huge fan of mole sauce and am always looking for places with good ones. I'll be back for more of that for sure. 
Machaca taquitos - lots of beef! We couldn't finish it all! Also had a very nice flavor. 

Would totally give this place a 5 star except for the price, $55 for the both of us, not outrageous,but not a bargain either. The food was good, so I'd go back. I want to try the camaron taquitos!"}
{"text":"There was a group of 10 of us so we were  seated in the private room which was perfect.  It was a Tuesday night so did not seem too busy.  We started with several different guacamole and salsas which were all great.  Beware of the grapefruit, mango, haberno salsa -- it has a killer kick to it, but so tasty.  Our server suggested the blood orange and rooster claw margarita mixed together  Three of us ordered it and we were not disappointed.  I slurped it down so I could order another.

All of us enjoyed our food, the fish taquitos were excellent and several who ordered the beef ribs said the meat was seasoned perfectly.  

Great evening as well as great food----and let's not forget those wonderful margaritas.  Our server was efficient, friendly and wonderful at making suggestions.

I know I will return to try some of the other margaritas and tamales."}
{"text":"Great Happy hour, amazing atmosphere, friendly service, best tamales I've ever had."}
{"text":"Don't really see what the fuss is about tbh, guacamole was small portion for 8$ and the smokey salsa was overly powerful with the smoke.... the carnitas wasn't my style, it was just a jumbled combination that didn't favor the pallets . but I liked the steak but it's not good enough for a return , I guess it's not my cup of tea"}
{"text":"What a great place, such a good flavor and atmosphere!!
Came in just expecting another TexMex menu... I was very surprised to find the authenticity of the food and beverage menu the flavored margaritas are amazing ( specially the Jamaica) as well as the dishes themselves and the outstanding service by all staff members. Can't wait to go back and try it again!!"}
{"text":"I attempted to take my in-laws to El Carnicero this weekend; we've previously dined at their sister restaurant Momocho, so I was excited to give them a good meal.  We had my 4-month-old daughter with me (sleeping in her car seat) and it was 6:30 pm.  We waited for over 2 hours; handfulls of parties were seated before us, most of which who arrived after us... we asked multiple times about our table, to which they said they had no four-tops. However, they then proceeded to seat a four-top after us... We were discriminated against - pure and simple.  A child does not make me a bad patron. Beyond disappointed, we were forced to leave the establishment without ever being served."}
