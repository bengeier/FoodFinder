{"text":"Love that this business has joined the hood. But I was a little disappointed at the food and the price point. The menu is super tiny and they have designed the menu like the dim sum restaurants where you mark how many orders of the items on the menu you want. But the app items are super expensive. My husband and I had the fried tofu, the wings, and the shumai and also the steak bowl. The Shumai was great, the wings were okay and the tofu was good but too expensive for what you got. Also the waitress was a tad snappy & super snobby. The restaurant was pretty empty. Only 2 tables and 1 person at the bar, which was her brother. She paid more attention to him than anyone else. And when she came to our table to take our plates away when there was still food in them, she would get annoyed. Well if I'm paying $10 dollars for 10 pieces of fried tofu, I'm very well going to eat every single one of those pieces. So RELAX!  Also, kinda weird that they don't have any hot sauce and when we asked for some hot sauce she was offended. She could have offered to bring us some red chillis that came as garnish. Needless to say a little disappointed at this experience. Had high expectations. I'll probably not be back for a while. I hope they survive and improve their customer experience."}
{"text":"My friend and I walked in, the restaurant was half full and we were told to hang ou jackets out front because there's no place for them at our table. We sat down at a small table with and I noticed someone at booth seats were leaving. I asked the waitress if we could switch, but she declined because it was reserved. Which wasn't the case. Anyway, we proceed to order a cocktail, beer and 3 dishes. The drinks took around 10 mins, my gin and tonic was too bitter with a strong kefir lime leaf. 20 mins later our first dish came. Salmon tartar: shrimp chips, diced salmon with cucumbers and slices of cucumbers. The dish lacks flavour, all we taste was cucumbers. The other 2 dishes came 45 mins after we ordered. Oyster sauce red curry squid on rice: dish was too salty, no curry flavour. Beef and Papaya salad: Beef was the cooked perfectly however the papaya salad was the worst I've tasted... seems like the only seasoning they used was fermented shrimp paste. Total on bill was $75. Overall experience was poor and the food was definitely not worth the price."}
{"text":"when i learned that there was a cambodian restaurant not far from my airbnb, i had to go. i was greeted by a heavenly aroma as i walked in the door and my mouth started the water. while the restaurant was busy, i was able to quickly get seats at the counter. the bartender Brian was very helpful and friendly. Upon my request, suggested his favorite dishes. My friend and I ordered all 3 and were not disappointed. The squid was cooked perfectly so as to not be too chewy like other places i've been and the curry spice level was exactly how i like it. i had to try the signature pina colada and it did not disappoint!"}
{"text":"One of the tastiest meals I've had in a few months, for certain.

The cozy little restaurant and cocktail bar is a bit dark but the staff is very nice and no matter where you sit you can check out the action going on in the open kitchen (which is near the entrance - and there was quite a bit of action!).

We just decided to order a bunch of menu items to share. The appetizers weren't too impressive (but they were tasty). I liked the small dish of peanuts but could have passed on the tofu dumplings. The nuts had great seasoning. If anything they could have been a touch spicier. 

The main dishes we tried were impeccable though! The squid and shrimp red curry as well as the braised pork (both over rice) really rocked my world. All the proteins were cooked to perfection. The shrimp and squid had a great chew to them without any trace of the rubbery consistency you can get when they're overdone. The braised pork practically melted in your mouth. So delicious. 

A touch pricey, but then again I'm a bit of a cheap fella. Not too expensive that I wouldn't go back! I will gladly return for another meal and hopefully not in too long!!

Ps. Ask for the chili oil if you like some extra spice. It gave the dishes more heat with a really good flavour to boot. Good for any leftover rice that you didn't stuff into your mouth with the other components of the dish!"}
{"text":"Bar with Cambodia inspired tapas made to order by the owner himself.

I came for dinner on their 2nd day opening & ordered more than half of the items on the menu.

The menu consist of shareable dishes similar to 'Mahjong Bar' and '416 Snack Bar' with an extensive list of beverage from tap, cocktail & tall boys. 

As it's new, there's a few kinks to work out. Their tap wasn't operating but that's minor and wasn't an issue since they served other beverages.

The food was flavourful & complimented  well with  the  ingredients. However I found it a bit salty - mainly fried tofu which was overpowered by the fish sauce. I would recommend the beef stew rice, Salmon tartare & cold crispy pork belly."}
{"text":"Came in on a Saturday night. Place was packed and I was seated right away by the owner. 

The highlight was definitely the fish sauce chicken wings. All of our tables food came promptly although it was busy. 

Other good highlights include the papaya salad, salmon tartare and poke. 

My first time having Cambodian and definitely won't be my last."}
{"text":"Solid 3.5 star
 
It's nice to see more varieties of South East Asian cuisine in Toronto, and especially in the Roncy neighbourhood where there aren't many Asian food options. I've been to Cambodian once and the food here is similar to what I remembered with a modern/fusion twist. 

We ordered five dishes - 5 apps and 1 rice/main dish because we learned that it's more of a sharing style here. It turned out to be a bit more than what we could eat which is all our fault 'cause server did mention usually 4 dishes are good for 2 people lol I read another review from before aging they didn't inform you of allergies and I guess they read the review and improved - our server told us most dishes contain soy and use shrimp paste, which is a common ingredient in this type of cuisine. 

The portion is pretty decent even for apps  We had the shrimp Shi Mai, Salmon Tartar with Shrimp Chip, Crispy Chicken wings, a curry chicken with with toast stuffed with chicken liver pate, and a beef papaya salad. We loved everything especially the first three. The curry chicken is really good, but overpowering the liver pate between the breads so I didn't really taste the complexity of tastes it might have intended for. The beef was good but the papaya salad didn't really make me feel anything different from green mango salad - guess I was expecting a bit more of papaya flavour. 

The rice bowl we had is a pork belly or shoulder dish on top of rice. It was good, big portion.

We also ordered the rum punch - a bit different from the red version on IG it's yellow. Probably made of different fruits. Still taste pretty good."}
{"text":"Slow service, salty food. 

The restaurant works as a concept but fails to stick the landing. Sure, it is kinda cool to see the action of an open kitchen, but this only allows for ONE chef. I'd give this up in order to not have to wait 30+ minutes for my food (nevermind my later arriving/ordering neighbors getting their food before me). The portions were a bit too small for the price demanded and had little flavour other than salt. Glass noodles were good though and the overall aesthetic of the restaurant was nice too.

I'll give props to the restaurant for offering an option to buy a meal for the less fortunate. That's a first I've seen in Toronto so good on them for helping out."}
{"text":"Drop by this little restaurant to try the Cambodian/Chinese cuisine iWork my friends. This small, upbeat and cozy place was adorable!  The price was kinda pricy for the portion but the food made it worth it.

We ordered 4 app and 2 main dishes! My favourite was the shi mai, chicken wing and peanuts!! In my opinion the main dishes (squid oyster sauce/curry & striploin long bean and papaya salad) was a little salty but if you pair it off with some alcohol it's still pretty good! Overall I enjoy this little restaurant and would definitely drop by again."}
{"text":"Food is excellent and the chef's table experience is wonderful.  Service is uniformly pleasant and welcoming."}
{"text":"I was excited to check this place out as I always make an effort to try out new Asian tapas restaurants. The food was a 3/5 but the service gets a 1/5. I ordered 4 items + 2 drinks and they started bringing drinks/food that I didn't order. I figured they were just mixing up tables but after bringing me what they punched in, they clearly had 2 orders combined into 1. My cousin ordered an iced tea and they didn't tell us it was sold out until we asked if it was coming.

In the end, I ended up having to pay for a dish I never ordered from the confusion of crossing items out and to \"make it up\" they took a beer off my bill. I'm shocked that on a $100 bill, they decided the $10 difference between the dish and beer was better in their pocket instead of trying to rectify the situation.

I will not be returning or recommending this place."}
{"text":"Waited for a long time for food to come, and the portion is pretty small, the place has a bad smell, not a good experience"}
{"text":"Good spot. Certainly better than the inane ska-themed burger place that used to be here. Dishes are pretty sizeable and shareable for the price point, and they have some nice sippers on tap. Good addition to the neighbourhood.

In the world of Jello B., I'd \"holiday in Cambodia\" if the food was this good haha!"}
{"text":"Came here for a good friend's diner tonight. The ambiance of the place was great and the food came out fast. Here are the reasons for the low rating... we didn't enjoy the one sheet of menu per table system as we were a big group it slowed things down for everyone to decide their dish. We asked for hot sauce and apparently they don't have any sauces on the side provided. We were also disappointed that there was no dessert. Lastly, the music was a tad bit too loud."}
{"text":"Really nice spot with great flavours. My server was extremely friendly and upfront about all potential allergens on the menu. Service was great all evening. The menu is fairly small but has a decent amount of options. Might be a bit limited for a strict pescatarian and a strict vegetarian probably best avoid. Great selection of local craft beer and non-alcoholic drinks. We didn't try any of the cocktails.

My dining partner and I ordered five dishes (three appetizers, the peanuts, and one main/rice dish) and this was a perfect amount for two healthy appetites. These are definitely sharing plates, but they are decent sized and not just tasting portions. The peanuts and tofu were both really great, and perfect starters for the meal. Salmon tartar was not my favourite, but my partner who loves any and all salmon enjoyed it. The shumai was very good and the squid and rice curry dish was hearty and very tender.

Definitely recommend stopping in. The restaurant was quite busy when we visited and I can see this remaining the case."}
