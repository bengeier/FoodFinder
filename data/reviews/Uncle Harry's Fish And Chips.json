{"text":"Been going here for years - fast and friendly service.Mind you, it's not quite as good as about 10 years ago before the business changed hands. Halibut and chips are pretty good, good sized meals. No complaints.  It's not bad for some good old fashioned fish and chips."}
{"text":"Staff: Friendly Food: not very spectacular. but ok. Price: Low"}
{"text":"Been here a few times, first few times was pretty good. The service was great and the food was good and cheap. It was during my last visit the place went downhill! I ordered a side salad to go with my burger. After a long wait, the salad comes and I start chomping down. About halfway, I noticed a few small fruit flies at the bottom. I told the waitress and they replaced the salad for me (though I lost my appetite by then). The second salad they bring back had a huge house fly smack dead in the center of it! To make matters worse, when I went to pay (yes I actually decided to pay), they charged me for both salads. Needless to say, I stormed out (without paying duh!) and will never go back again."}
{"text":"Not a good place for fish and chips. Both fish and fries were really subpar. Tarter sauce was terrible too. Won't be going there again, ever."}
{"text":"Not good as i expected! The staff are very friendly, and gives good service. The fish & chips are okay for the price your getting. Wish it can be a lot better and the Fish is very old-fashioned. Too much batter and less fish, and the tarter sauce is horrible you can tell it's store bought.  If you want a very cheap meal for $4.99 plus tax you're getting 2 pieces of fish, fries, with a store bought packaged tarter sauce & any can of pop.  Will come back again but only for the fries."}
{"text":"i normally try to finish my food no matter what but i couldnt with the food here. i bought a burger and it was the worst thing ive ever eaten. I didnt even eat half of it and threw it out. the food is not quality, especially for the price you'll have to pay."}
{"text":"I've only been here a few times so far, but so far I love it. The Halibut and Chips was really good and fresh. Fish was so flaky on the inside. YUM."}
