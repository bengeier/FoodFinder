{"text":"What a bizarre evening at this establishment, the kale salad was delish but it went down hill after that, wrong taco served then taken away, new right taco served, it was shrimp and 1 of 3 shrimp still had its tail hmmm tasted crunchy. Then the waiter says we would like to give you desserts and one slice of pie is brought to a table of 8 and I was charged for the shrimp tail taco, shame on you Tarbell's, the pie was ok."}
{"text":"I've been searching for a legitimate Lobster Roll here in the valley for quite some time and now, that search is over. The Deviled Eggs were as splendid as the service and the selection of wine was spot on. I for one can't wait to get back !"}
{"text":"Decent BLT and fries but at $24 it's a bit pricey for what you get. The BLT across the street at Keegan's is just as good and is a much better value.  Server was nice but not super attentive.   They don't offer black tea, only green tea so I just drank water.  Not sure I will be back in the future. Worth the three stars I gave it."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful time at The Tavern. The wine selection is what we have all come to expect from Tarbell - excellent. I would highly recommend the tomato and goat cheese salad. Exceptional staff and a very welcoming atmosphere. Great place for a happy hour - need to get a happy hour menu!"}
{"text":"We got the classic double cheese burger and the BLT. Great execution here on some simple dishes. Drinks were well priced and a good beer selection and the option to go next door and pick out a bottle is very nice.   Great food at a reasonable price point."}
{"text":"As regulars of Tarbell's, we had high expectations for the Tavern. And it totally delivered! Braden was our server, and was was fun and knowledgeable about the menu. One of the staff saw that we had be sitting for a moment or two waiting to order, and he brought us a plate of Truffle Bikinis which were delicious little grilled cheese mini-sandwiches. I ordered the cheeseburger with house-made potato chips - best burger that I have ever had! For dessert, I had the coconut creme pie and a glass of champagne - which was also delicious. So, it was pretty easy to give the Tavern 5 stars. Once again, Mark Tarbell produces a lovely ambiance, delicious food, and excellent service. High five Mark!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed it. My tip is to get the cheese plate. Beautiful presentation and plentiful. Also tried the crab cake with apple and arugula. Very good. Can't wait to go back. Nice wine by the glass selection too."}
{"text":"Great meal at The Tavern.  My buddy and I each ordered the salmon burger.  Instead of the usual sides, we each customized:  I ordered a salad, buddy ordered fries.    We loved our burgers!  I loved my salad.  But buddy thought the fries were too salty, so the waiter whisked them away and brought her unsalted ones.  Verdict?  The only thing buddy didn't do was lick the plate!!!    The staff was friendly...the atmosphere was relaxed.  Having the wine store only semi separated is unique and fun.  (I bought two bottles after dinner.)  The Tavern is exactly what it should be: a casual neighborhood place you can drop into that even your foodiest friends will enjoy."}
{"text":"What a gift to our community!  Tarbell's the Tavern stepped up and rescued a support group I was sponsoring April 25th after another establishment left us out in the cold.   Invitations had already been mailed when I discovered the prior restaurant could not accommodate our group. In a controlled panic, I stopped by Tarbells to check for availability and Mary Basha calmly and confidently took control of the location debacle.  Tarbell's The Tavern not only offered us their whole restaurant as a private event, but also brilliantly worked within our budget creating a delectable buffet. The chef even came out and introduced her work (when does that ever happen!), service was exemplary and our patients were treated like royalty.   Thank you again Mary Basha and Tarbell's The Tavern for showing such kindness and grace to our group; we will be sharing your praises statewide and loyal for life!  Outstanding!"}
{"text":"What a great place! Comfortable, welcoming and most importantly; delicious!  Started with crab gazpacho, smoked salmon and chive grilled cheese, deviled eggs and a tomato/ polenta/avacados salad. All 4 of them were great! I would suggest all 4 of them as starters.  For dinner, the 4 of us, we split 3 entrees; the burger, lobster roll and tacos (three fish, one octopus). The burger and tacos were amazing. The burger, may be the best is town! White bun, great meat with the perfect amount of seasoning, the secret sauce with iceberg lettuce. Nothing fancy, but perfectly done. Friggin great!! The fish tacos were huge and soo good! Both salsas were extremely flavorful. I liked the fish over the octopus, but it was close. The octopus was meatier than I expected and grilled to perfection.  The lobster roll was ehhh, but take with a grain of salt, as I am not a huge fan of lobster.  Tavern only serves beer and wine.   This is a top-notch restaurant with very attentive service! I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"We had the pleasure of visiting this new restaurant on a beautiful evening in May.  The restaurant has a great atmosphere - lots of natural materials, comfortable seating, and a large bar area.  We enjoyed perusing the cocktail menu - all of the cocktails are either beer or wine based and it was interesting to see the creativity involved in devising and executing the drinks.  Our bartender - Joe - was very knowledgeable about each item on the menu. He even provided a wine-by-wine description of every white Burgundy on the wine list.  He demonstrated an amazing command  of the restaurant's offerings.  We sampled quite a few things on the menu: baked kale chips (yum!), tomato and goat cheese salad (yum! yum!), crab cake (yum! yum! yum!) and the ham and pickle bikini (swing and a miss!).  I think we were expecting more of a cuban sandwich vibe, and it had a chopped ham texture. We also had a taste of the spinach and crab dip which is one of their signature appetizers.   The service was spot on.  These guys execute flawlessly when it comes to making their customers feel special and appreciated.  Not surprising when you realize that Ty is one of the managers of the restaurant.  Ty is already a powerhouse in the greater Phoenix area in terms of hospitality. Just wait - he will accomplish great things!  Visit, be adventurous, and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Everytime we come to Tarbell's Tavern, we wonder why we don't come here more often. Had the green beans, lettuce wraps, and lamb burger (medium rare of course). Every bite was fabulous, and you can always trust the server to recommend a good wine. Finishing with the coconut cream pie, which honestly, is the best in the country."}
{"text":"I went to Tarbell's when I was on vacation a few weeks ago. The appetizers were phenomenal. It was my first time having escargot and it was amazing! My main dish was good, not spectacular. It was very cramped and noisy in there, but other than that it was very good!"}
{"text":"Live very close by.  Excellent wines on tap and the food and service is top notch.  Recently went for a birthday dinner with a friend, fabulous food as always.  They had unfortunately removed my favorite dish, the Gnudi from the menu due to the chef's lack of satisfaction with how it had turned out that evening (have had it multiple times before, and it has always been excellent).  They comped my second choice meal.  Thoughtful.  Bought a bottle of Pinot on the way out...certainly not the cheapest place to buy your wine, but here you will get small batch wines that you can't get at the big box stores.    Lovely place to eat.  Excellent customer service, food, and atmosphere.    Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Until tonight, we have been Tarbell's Tavern fans--only good things to say. Tonight was different.   Nice to see this place is doing a good business, but concerned that the service has slowed way down--10 minutes until we got our drinks, another 15 before our companions' drinks arrived, and over an hour until we received our food order. My \"Big Plate\" Scotch beef was uber salty, not so big, and mostly about mashed potatoes, which the menu does not even mention as part of this order (had I known, I would have substituted veggies). The lamb burger a companion always orders arrived minus the usual caramelized onions (the waiter explained that \"they weren't popular,\" though they remain in the description on the menu). Other toppings listed on the dish were forgotten. Our \"on tap\" prosecco arrived flat. We were happy to be able to send it back & switched to the wonderful \"by the bottle\" option the Tavern offers. (Though we did have to remind the bar staff to hand over the corked bottle. We also had to ask out waiter to remove those glasses of flat prosecco from our bill.)  No other way to say this: not up to expectations. Big disappointment."}
{"text":"Best food and bar in town!  My mom, a couple other family members and I went in to get some of their crab gazpacho (which is the best thing I have ever put in my mouth) but the menu had changed for the season.  When Mark Tarbell heard us talking about the gazpacho he made sure to tell us they could make it up special for us.  They went next door to Tarbell's restaurant to get some crab...and by some I mean a lot of crab...and made us four bowls of the best gazpacho ever.  Thanks Mark for making our evening special and exceeding all of our expectations!  Oh, and Ryan the bartender is really cute too :).  You definitely need to go there!"}
{"text":"My wife and I had dinner here on Thursday, April 17, 2014.  The staff were friendly and accommodating.  We had the polenta and deviled eggs for appetizers and shared the BLT and croque madame for the main eats.  Everything was spectacular!  Nice selection of Arizona beers on the drinks menu and, as always with Tarbell's, a great wine selection!  Another great restaurant by Mark Tarbell!"}
{"text":"Great decor and wines - but lacking on the food menu, highlighting too many greasy options. And no happy hour...makes me miss Sportsman's.  Would recommend stopping by for a glass of wine only but head to Tarbell's restaurant (or one of the many other great Arcadia spots) for a good meal."}
{"text":"we enjoyed excellent service and very good food. salads were perfect as was soft shell crab and chicken livers. broad pasta was excellent as was scottish beef. very good and extensive wine list. wonderful experience and good value for the price"}
{"text":"The food is delicious, the staff eager to take your dishes away. Be sure to keep a hand on your drink or plate when you're not looking...they may remove it.  The noise is really loud. So loud I was hoarse the next day after trying to speak to my dinner companions.  I've tried twice now and despite the tasty meal it's too hard to enjoy yourself in that racket."}
{"text":"Definitely one of my new favorite spots! The atmosphere is very cozy and quaint. The lobster roll is by far my #1 choice but I always request the lobster to be warmed up and it's truly to die for! If you like lobster rolls you know that there are no good rolls anywhere near Arizona!  Tavern offers a variety of food choices and my other top choices would be their tacos and bikinis. Both delicious! They have a very unique specialty drink list with a lot of unusual combinations, which makes it fun to choose something new. I highly recommend this little gem:)"}
{"text":"Been here several times.  A fav dish - green chile pork stew - was served luke warm & bland. Sloppy Joe sliders were on regular size cheap hamburger buns with cold Kraft American cheese slices and the ground beef mixture was slop, alright.  Manwich in a can is better.  Thin french fries were half cooked and cold when served.   Love owner chef Mark Tarbell but he needs to rethink the menu and take a closer look here.   Pretty obvious the waiter knew all this as he never once asked how things were."}
{"text":"My steak came out cold, as was the coconut carrot soup/baby food they offered instead. Green Chile pork looked good but had no spice and was also lukewarm. My sister's meal was served well after everyone else's. The manager and waitress comped the cold dish and offered free dessert, so that was the best part of this experience. Sad."}
{"text":"Dinner included the mixed greens salad ($10), wedge salad ($10) and the Chiliquiles ($19). The salads were very good and the Chiliquiles were amazing!  Restaurant does a great job splitting meals if you're not too hungry, but the meal is so good you may not want to share! Nice wine selection.  Options for beer are limited to the non-mainstream options.  Reasonably priced! Nice atmosphere in the restaurant. The only critique was when we ordered our salads with the dressing on the side it came with a fairly modest amount of dressing. Fine for me, but not my wife. When we asked for one extra dressing it took awhile to get the dressing and then it showed up as a .50 charge on the bill. The server said he had to charge for the dressing so he could get it from the kitchen. We were not told about the charge (not a huge deal/amount), but it would have preferred for the server to mention the charge when we requested he extra dressing. Overall, a great dinning experience! We'll be back!"}
{"text":"My friends and I had an amazing experienced here.Food was well presented and the taste was spectacular. We ordered Scallop Avocado Toast, Ceviche, Burgers and Tacos. It was an amazing experienced and for sure we will difinately go back and share our experience with our friends."}
{"text":"This is another outstanding restaurant in Phoenix Biltmore area.  Wines by the glass or buy the bottle from the wine shop and no corkage. Having a great Joseph Phelps 2014 Pinot Noir with the Tuna Tartare.  This made with a homemade ponzu which had some spice and mixed in some soy beans.  Exceptional. We then slip the devolved eggs....to die for! Light with a hint of chipotle and dry mustard whipped core.  Finished with the lettuce wraps, lightly fried chicken with Thai slaw and dressing .. outstanding.  Staff is outstanding !"}
{"text":"Had a late night dinner and we were very pleased with the wait staff and the food was great!  We were able to taste the wine before ordering.  There's a wine store next door where you can purchase a bottle to bring to your table!  We especially liked the skinny fries with siracha ketchup!"}
{"text":"This wine bar used to be sportsman. Tarbels has done s very nice job! Deviled eggs amazing. Cheese and charcuterie also well done.  Prices are reasonable for the Biltmore.  You can buy a bottle from the wine shop too and drink all or part hete."}
{"text":"The best restaurant gluten free friendly the service was amazing Nichole and Mikey at the bar where wonderful knew there Kraft!!! We met the Stephano the manager was so informative. The bar ambulance was lovely!! The fish dish was cooked to perfection. Omg gluten free calamari was so crisp and yummy. The dinning experience was a 12 thank you"}
{"text":"What a disappointment. First, from the name we assumed there would be more beers on tap, or that the difference would at least be clear. We were surprised when our beer showed up in a can and an overly chilled pint glass.   Well, ok. We made an assumption so I guess that was on us. Unfortunately things didn't really improve. Our waitress had very few suggestions for us on the food, so we made our own guesses and went with the green pork stew and the chilaquiles. These were the only high point of the evening. Both were tasty and rich and presented beautifully other than my tortillas being a bit soggy.  Once we were done we sat and waited for another good 15 minutes before our waitress returned. We realized we hadn't seen her at all since right after the food was delivered, so no idea where she went. Other employees passed our table repeatedly  but didn't offer to clear the table. It gave me time to look at the decor (nice) and count the many security cameras (6, that I could see).  When our waitress finally reappeared, chatting with someone from the nearby wine store, we were closed out quickly. There were five employees all milling about the center of the place near the POS screen and they all continued the tradition of ignoring us that had been the case all evening. Not a single Thanks, Goodbye, or even a Good Riddance. It was like they just didn't care.  We won't be back."}
{"text":"Just not good food. Plenty of other places to dine. Service is wonderful but the food is just not good.  Pasta ok, salads very ordinary, etc"}
{"text":"Met a friend last night for a glass of wine.  Although we didn't eat, I plan to go back soon as the menu looked great.  Service was terrific even though we were just having wine.  My only concern is that the price point for wine is just a little high.  I understand why--but my comfort zone is always closer to 8/9 for a glass.  Anyway-they did a great job on the interior--still has some of the sportsman's feel and still just as warm and inviting.  looking forward to trying the food."}
{"text":"Went to the tavern to meet friends who were listening to a band. Packed location, difficulty parking, but good vibe.  Met friends who had table in bar area, the greeter went above and beyond, found a booth for 7 of us so we could sit together. They were great.  Band was great. Spot was crowded. Hard to move around and hear.  Ordered drinks and dinner. Salad for one of party was good. My BLT was ok, not as great as advertised. Overcooked bacon, mayo had a fishy flavor, meh.  Thin fries ordered ... came out cold. Asked for a new order. Waited a little while, came out hot. Ketchup had a little kick of spice- super good.  Problem came with the bill. Charged us not once, but twice for the fries. Ok to charge for the cold fries replaced, but twice?? Didn't realize until we left. Nothing to do because we had to leave. Maybe should have warmed fries between my hands instead of asking for new order.  BLT was ok, Fries cold but ketchup great, overcharged, crowded but fun.  Maybe that is what is \"in\". I won't be back. Tarbell should do better"}
{"text":"Love this place!  Samuel our server was great! We came in for the lobster rolls and they were amazing! The tavern is beautiful and to the point. Great for date nights or to even impress a first date! My fiancé and I can not wait to come back!! This might be a weekly hang out spot for us :) next to try : Killer corn beef"}
{"text":"Decent wine selection but it changes so what is on Yelp is not correct. Kinda dark and dingy inside, thought it would be nicer.  We ordered the charcuterie and cheese board. Cheese was good but the charcuterie was not charcuterie. Instead of cured meats there was bacon, salmon pate and COLD chicken patties. I guess bacon is a cured meat but what about salami, prosciutto, etc.? It was disgusting.  Disappointed and would not return."}
{"text":"So I was pretty bummed when Sportman's closed, I really enjoyed that place. I was curious to try its replacement The Tavern to see if it lived up to its predecessor. It's definitely a different concept than Sportman's, it's no longer a Wine Bar and is more of restaurant. The menu offered lots of options from charcuterie boards to lobster rolls. My husband and I weren't too hungry, so we chose the heirloom tomato salad and lamb burger to share, and I had the Shandy for my beverage. They split both orders for us which was nice. The salad had a fantastic pesto dressing and included perfectly ripe tomatoes and creamy goat cheese, it was very good. The lamb burger was fantastic too, it was cooked a perfect medium rare and was quite juicy and bursting with flavor as it was topped with feta and arugula. My Shandy was also good, it included wheat beer with lemon and basil infused syrup. Our server explained that their cocktails are different in that they don't use any liquor, just beer, wine or sake. Our meal at the Tavern was quite good and service was very welcoming and on point. My only complaint is that it's a little overpriced, the burger was $19 and the salad was $15. I guess that's to be expected in the Biltmore area, but it will deter me from coming here as often as I would like. That being said I would recommend trying out the Tavern."}
{"text":"So I'm on this marrow bone kick, and The Tavern has the best marrow bone dish in the city. The oysters are awesome, especially the mignonette.  We had all four of the bikinis, and my favorites were the smoked salmon and the ham-and-pickle. Based on the menu, I will be able to eat here a dozen times before I come close to trying everything on this menu that I want. The wine list is not huge but it's comprehensive and bizarrely inexpensive. The service is exceptional (sit with Sam if you can). There is nothing about this place not to love."}
{"text":"One of my favorites in Phoenix. It's been around for a while, and there's a reason why. The food is cuisine, friendly service, and great location. My favorites are the cheesecake, filet, and the chicken."}
{"text":"I have eaten at The Tavern probably 12 times between dinner and lunches. Tonight though was absolutely not their best. First we should start with the fact that the restaurant was way noisy. I get most restaurants are noisy these days but this was over the top.   The fries are dubbed thin and crisps but these were way overdone. The BLT is award winning but tonight the bacon was over done and the bread burnt. My wife ordered the fettuccine which was watery. It was actually inedible. I've never ordered it before but can be sure I won't order it again. I will give them another chance but I have to say I am disappointed in tonight's effort."}
{"text":"Just had dinner with a party of 9 at The Tavern, the meal was amazing and the service was even better.  If you really want to treat yourself eat at \"The Tavern\" and ask for Zack."}
{"text":"I can't comment on the food because we never even got to try it, but the service is horrendous! We were sat pretty quickly, but after not even receiving a water in the first 15 minutes of being there we decided to leave.  The restaurant was NOT busy at all... the place that we are sitting at now sat is immediately, water on the table in 3 minutes, and had beers in hand within 5 minutes.  Spend your money where you matter.  We will not be giving this place another chance."}
{"text":"Cute spot! Just moved near by, visited with my bf and sat at the bar. He got a burger and I got the gnudi. Both were delicious, they have good deals on wine and beer although I didn't see any HH specials.They did have quite a large selection of wine and beer to choose from at all price points, no alcohol though.   For an app and a glass of wine or a mid priced quality during the week Ill be back."}
{"text":"It was hard not to compare this place to Sportsman's, but I wanted to make sure this review was not partial.  Nice atmosphere with a large bar, friendly bartenders and an extensive wine list...plus you can buy a bottle at retail next door and bring it next door with no corkage fee.  We enjoyed a glass of wine while watching football and enjoyed our experience.  I still wish Sportsman's was still here though...I absolutely loved the spaghetti squash as it was beyond delicious!"}
{"text":"Amazing food but the service tonight was incredible. I would go back any time for the food alone, but the staff was so accommodating that it will always be at the top of my list. I made several requests tonight that I thought couldn't be met, and they said no problem, we'll see what we can do, and made it happen."}
{"text":"There are some places you just want to keep to yourself. Tarbell's Tavern is my hot bath, favorite jammies, great glass of wine, crawl into bed, fire burning, book reading, tummy super happy deliciously full ~ kind of place. I'm not even going to discuss the amazing plates because it's Mark Tarbell. Upscale pub. Excellent music, perfect acoustics for the music and hearing the person next to or across from you. The bartender turned me on to a delicious way to finish off my oysters. It' s hard to stump me on the oyster front. Yet, he did. I never would have picked that liquid accompaniment. I could tell you. But, they can deliver it. I am so lucky this is in my neighborhood. But, I would drive, bike, or pogo there anytime if it's wasn't. Thank you Mark for this amazing little gem and the attention to such fine details. except the pens...wood grain would be amazing with the block. Just saying...Cheers!"}
{"text":"Fantastic and fun food with wine with no up charge!  My brothers favorite place to eat with great music playing ..."}
{"text":"Mark Tarbell does it again. For all you Phoenicians you have to try the crisp fried chicken. It even brought back fond memories for a small town girl who grew up on great tasting Chicken dinners. Sending a shout out to all you baseball families, take it from one who is married to a #1Scout and former pitcher, this is the place to grab your favorite bottle of wine from the Tavern Store and enjoy it with a fabulous Mark Tarbell menu. Sooo delicious."}
{"text":"Victoria is an amazing bartender, and gives such great service! Good selection of wine, and the selection of hard cider has gotten better over the past few months. The food menu is limited, but everything I have had has been good! Only thing is they seem to close quite early, and are not open Sundays"}
{"text":"No corkage fee if you buy a bottle of wine from next door. Great for lunch since the restaurant next door is only open for diner. The BLT puts almost a pond of bacon on it. A bit on the pricey side but the lack of corkage makes up for it."}
{"text":"The Tavern is now OPEN FOR LUNCH during the week!!! Opening day was today! There were 4 of us and we enjoyed a delicious lunch of Warm spinach/Parmesan dip, bruschetta, a ridiculously huge BLT stuffed with a ton of crispy bacon, an equally huge classic American burger, sloppy joe's (YUM!), and chicken tacos! Washed it all down with one of their delightfully tart blackberry mint lemonades (there are 4 different lemonade flavors--will need to try them all!) Finished lunch with a beautiful apple pie. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Avocado toast with Noble bread on the lunch menu!  Totally awesome and worth another visit soon!"}
{"text":"Outstanding, casually upscale, wine only bar with fabulous food from the Tarbell's kitchen. Burgers are perhaps the best in Phoenix -- particularly when you get the double with a sunny side up fried egg on top. Noodle bowls are interesting and good. Coconut cream pie is a must for dessert. They serve wine on tap at very reasonable prices -- Smith and Hook is our favorite.  This place is on my \"regular\" list and list 2-3 times per month. See you there!"}
{"text":"Tarbell's restaurant is a Phoenix gem with innovative food from chef/owner Mark Tarbell. Part of the menu changes with the seasons and other items remain as on going favorites. Service was spot on by our server Allan and his assistants that helped clean up.  Soup of the day was Butternut Squash. Rich, buttery and silky. A half bowl was sufficient.  The Seasonal Chowda entree is chock full of salmon, swordfish, mussels, charred tomatoes, haricot and leeks. A beautiful rendition of Fisherman's Stew. The Center-Cut Tenderloin Filet with Lump Jonah Crab. Haricot, buttermilk mashed, with velvet dime-glace. The crab was served hot and on the side as requested to be shared. The deme-glace was rich and tasty as the perfect complement for the steak."}
{"text":"The ambiance was great and as fans of Tarbell's it is nice to have great food but in a more casual environment. Plus owner Mark Tarbell came by our table to welcome and thanked us for coming in and as the night progressed I saw him do that with each table. That was a really nice touch and I haven't experienced that type of service with any other restaurant in town.  We tried 3 of the 4 bikinis on the menu and they were all delicious, made with some of the best tasting bread I have had in awhile. Plus the portions are perfect to start and cut to sharable sizes, that is if you don't eat it all first.   I ordered the chicken street tacos for dinner. You get 3 large tacos, which I really enjoyed but it was almost to much food for me, enjoyed the salsa verde the comes on the side. We shared the coconut cream pie for dessert and let me tell you that it was the most amazing dessert I have ever had. I definitely recommend ordering it, even if you don't think you could possibly eat anymore once you taste it you'll be licking the plate clean.    They are only open for dinner which is a shame because there are so many items on the menu that would be a great lunch.  Definitely plan on going back to try the burger."}
{"text":"My wife and I enjoyed a past visit to Tarbell's and signed up for their email list to learn of the two other business Mark Tarbell owns that are actually next door to one another - The Tavern and the The Wine Store. The email I received said that at The Tavern, for this one night only, they are offering \"Beer-Battered Georges Bank Cod with Golden Fries, Fresh Coleslaw and Tartar Sauce, and your choice of a Beer or glass of Wine $25 per person (excluding tax and gratuity).   Having never been to The Tavern before, I didn't know what the expected wait time might be on a typical Friday night or if there was a dress code. Reservations can only be made for parties of 6 or more. I called them and spoke to 'Charlie' who let me know the place is small, but we will probably have no wait to be seated if we come in before 7:30pm. He asked for my name and said since he wasn't working in the evening, he suggested I ask to speak with \"Corbin\" when we arrive and to let him know this is our first time there.  He also informed me there is no dress code and people dine there dressed up or in t-shirts and shorts.    We were seated right away, I asked to meet Corbin, and he introduced himself and welcomed us to the restaurant. My wife and I both order the fish and chips special (the regular menu was also available to order from). I had an IPA beer and my wife a Pino Noir. My wife ordered the deviled eggs appetizer and enjoyed it (I don't eat deviled eggs.)  The fish used in the fish and chips was as fresh as I've ever had. The batter was firm and stuck well to the fish, however, it was very bland. Some chefs believe the fish should be bland to pick up the flavors of the tartar, but I like to eat my fish plain. No lemon, no vinegar and no tartar. My wife and I both needed to add salt to give the fish a missing flavor. It was perfectly cooked. The fries were like steak fries, and nothing special there, but not bad, either.  We ordered the ice cream sandwich dessert and shared it. It was very good. The total bill was $68 + a $12 tip for our excellent server \"Jordan\" I think he said his name was...  The staff was attentive without being over-bearing. The atmosphere is nice without being pompous. If I could get a Tarbell's pizza at The Tavern, I would be there at least 3 times a month!   To eat a similar meal at Tarbell's, by comparison, one should dress nicer than a t-shirt and expect to pay at least another $20-$30 for the dinner tab. In that aspect, its like getting Tarbell's quality food at a discounted price, however, the menu's are not the same. I wouldn't be surprised if the staff offered to get me a pizza from next door, but I wouldn't feel right about ordering something 'special' even if it were  an option. I'd just like to see it on the menu.  It was a bit loud in there and difficult to hold a conversation at times. But the staff all have personalities and make you feel welcome. Even when the gentleman came out to light all the candles at the tables, he struck up a unique conversation with each table as he lit their candle. Not just an 'excuse me, I'll be gone in a second' attitude, but \"Hey, how's it going? Is everything good so far?\" and, hence, a nice, friendly conversation as he went from table to table.  We'll definitely be back here (and Tarbell's too when I feel like opening the wallet a little bit wider.)"}
{"text":"Went there for an event.   I must admit, not impressed.  Maybe I need to give it another shot.   Alcohol served is beer and wine.   I wasn't all that hungry but had a hankering for some fries.   Ordered the \"fat fries,\" and, yes, they were, ho hum, fries.   Not much flavor.   I think it could stand some seasoned salt or something.  I was not impressed with the wine either.   Maybe I need to order a $18-$20/glass.  It was hard to hear.   I could barely make out what the person sitting next to me was saying and forget about trying to understand/hear what the person sitting next to him was saying!  Since I like the food at Tarbell's, I dunno. I was looking for something good.  Didn't happen."}
{"text":"I had the tuna tartare and the beef carpaccio. Neither was too impressive but they were both good.  The wine was excellent and service outstanding. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Great food. Had the avocado toast add Barbacoa as on of our appetizers some of the best food in Phoenix.  Our server was great.....I can't remember his name but he looked like a hollister model/Tom Cruise. He had huge arms and a big faced gold watch."}
{"text":"I'm not happy. The tomato bisque was sour, they served cold hamburger on the cheese board, and the \"winning\" hamburger left to be desired. I won't be going back, especially for those prices!"}
{"text":"the best.  I keep going back.  there is so much to crave and the prices are good and the service is great."}
{"text":"The other night, before going to a show in downtown Phoenix, we had dinner at (Tarbell's) The Tavern on Camelback Road. We were referred there by a local ... and it turned out to be a marvelous experience.  This place offers a casual, upscale atmosphere with both bar and table seating. The wine store next-door was totally visible via a low wall opening on one side of the establishment.   We started with wine, snacking on deviled eggs with a whipped Dijon aioli mousse. We share everything (except our wine).  Next we sampled Tuna tartare with a miso aioli, house-made ponzu along with soy beans and carrots.  After ordering another glass of wine, we each consumed a bowel of wild mushroom soup. Rich and complex .... I could have made a meal of this treat. Finally we had the shellfish paella. It consisted on chorizo, saffron, a variety of fresh seafood including clams, mussels and shrimp. The grilled bread that came with it was a perfect compliment.    The wait-staff was knowledgeable and professional. Our server was the best. While not the least expensive, prices were competitive for what you get."}
{"text":"It was our first time in. Warm welcome. We sat at bar and bartender was very pleasant. We ordered the deviled eggs then we had the grilled corn on the cob. Yummy! Then we split the cheeseburger which was very juicy and tasty but to my linking, should not be rated as best burger in AZ.  It was all very good. We had the coconut pie for dessert. Also very good although not excellent. Overall very pleasant time. Nice little place. Good music although it kept playing the same 6-7 songs over and over again. Will come back for sure. Thank you!"}
{"text":"The food and wine were incredible and the service even more so. Thanks Zach for the excellent experience as we celebrated graduation and visited AZ from Minnesota. We have to come back to Arizona soon just to come back to The Tavern!"}
{"text":"The Tavern is open for lunch and I highly recommend!!  The best sliders EVER!!!   They delivered our office an amazing lunch that everyone enjoyed- Mr. Tarbell brought the food himself for our first order (what other restaurant do you know who would do that).  They brought an array of sliders (Beef, BLT and Chix Salad - all unreal delicious)  A butter lettuce grapefruit salad, Kale Salad (favorite), Crispy Shrimp lettuce wraps, Green Chili Pork Stew, Chicken Tacos and Deviled eggs.  All unique flavors and tasty!! YUM!"}
{"text":"Have consistently enjoyed me meals here since the first week it opened and the manager convinced me to try their coconut cream pie (he was so right on with that btw... delish)   have enjoyed the lobster roll, burger, appetizers and other items, always well prepared. seasoned and polished.   from the wine selection.l to the local beers and good eats I have not been disappointed with the tavern. I like this place for meals with the wife, work dinners and friend outings. has a nice and welcoming vibe."}
{"text":"In town on business. Stopped in and was so surprised! Loved the menu, very interesting and yummy. I will definitely be back! The waiter was so kind and had great suggestions! The ambiance was very fun  and they have their own wine store."}
{"text":"We went for the Prime Rib French Dip special. We would definitely go back. Get there early, this place fills up fast!"}
{"text":"Some friends were raving about the burger at Tarbell's so my boyfriend and I had to check it out for ourselves. We followed their lead an ordered the double burger but split it and an order of shoestring fries.  Even though our burger was halved it was still presented very nicely and the order of fries was the perfect amount for two people to share.  We ordered the burger medium and it was done just right. The burger itself was juicy and flavorful. The topping were fresh, the cheese was melty and abundant and the sauce was a great flavor addition. The bun was also nice and soft. I will say it was messy, but a good burger should be, right?  For dessert we had the Boston cream pie and our friends had the donuts. The Boston cream pie was fantastic. The chocolate on top was super fudgy and the cream was rich and silky smooth. It was kinda small for sharing but just enough to satisfy your sweet tooth. I tried one of the donuts and it was good but the Boston cream was definitely better.  Great service, nice atmosphere, delicious food. A successful Friday night dinner I would say."}
{"text":"The avocado toast WITH a side of the olive tapenade might be illegal it's so good!  Great spot for drinks and a bite'"}
{"text":"Excellent food in a perfect location. The beer menu is growing and ever-changing (now they have draft beers!) and if you're into wine you can pick a bottle from the shop next door to share or choose one of the great wines by the glass (Silver Oak by the glass!). My favorites: Lobster Roll, Burger, Beet Salad, any Wren House beer ;)"}
{"text":"This place is great. Wanted to give it 5 stars but our waitress was weak.  I eat about 50 hamburgers a year and it was one of the best hamburgers I've ever had in my life.  We also ordered the green chile and it was out of this world.  Will come back here soon."}
{"text":"One of the best experiences we've had in Phoenix in years.  We were celebrating a birthday and I was craving a burger. We sat at the bar and were treated like old friends. Our bartender offered tastes of the wines we were interested in and made food recommendations. I chose the single American Burger, which is the best burger in town by far. My wife chose the Lobster Roll- which came out perfect.  A guy next to us had bought a bottle of an ice wine, and was kind enough to share a taste with us. The vibe continued when we ordered dessert - the Coconut Cream Pie is heaven. No better word describes it. But the best part of our day was the service - both bartenders were very helpful and worked together to make us feel like regulars - which we plan on doing. Thanks!"}
{"text":"In this place, the tables are so close together you can hear everyone around you and there is no privacy. It makes you feel that the restaurant is only interested in how many patrons they can squeeze in to make as much money as possible. I had not been there in many years and did not remember it being that congested. It was very loud so you have to speak up to hear each other across the table, which lends to the privacy issue. I was practically rubbing elbows with a guy at the table of four next to us, and he yelled at me for using my phone flashlight to read the menu [which was necessary for all of us, with the lighting, etc], stating the light came over onto their table. Geez, how inconsiderate could I possibly be!?  The food and service were good, however, the prices do not represent the actual meal you receive. We paid $27 for some chicken, mashed potatoes and 3 green beans (not even an actual serving). My partner got The Seasonal Chowda, a \"small\" bowl of rice, seafood, sauce, nothing else. At those prices, the entrees do not come with salad, or even bread. We were with another couple, one of whom ordered the Margherita Pizza, which had no tomatoes! The other had the Mussels appetizer that was actually enough for a full meal, but it did not come with bread to soak up the awesome juices.  On a positive note, the apple dessert was very good.  The issues I raise here made no sense to any of us. The other couple had the same opinions of the crowded atmosphere, prices, no bread, etc."}
{"text":"I'm not really sure where to start and perhaps I'm a little too emotional to be doing this right now so I'll be brief and try to hold it together.  Their Lobster Roll has changed my life. Gone are the long nights when I would weep myself to sleep only to wake up in a cold sweat. My years long search for a true Lobster Roll here in the Phoenix Valley has come to an end. I take great comfort in knowing the folks here know the true art form of the Lobster Roll and I count the minutes until my next visit.  Great vine list, too"}
{"text":"Great alternative to eating in the full scale restaurant next door. Had an enjoyable time with a great wine expert who had excellent recommendations for our drinking experience. The food on this side is also very good - we loved the charcuterie and cheese boards - all top notch with quality ingredients - loved the various pickled vegetables included. Having interesting conversations about wine with the staff was a highlight for us - we were treated like VIPs by the knowledgable sommelier who you can tell loves wine! We would go back in a flash! Valet parking for the little corner mall it is found in."}
{"text":"Went to the wine store and the Tavern on a Thursday evening with family. Top notch service and unique menu with divine food! We all loved our meals and appetizers. Strongly suggest the butternut squash fettuccine, any burger and lettuce wraps. The restaurant is dimly lit and comfortable. Also, don't miss out on the wine store next door. They had an awesome professional sommelier that helped us pick an outstanding bottle of wine!"}
{"text":"Um - Why have I never been here before?! This little shopping area continues to prove to me that I have been living under a rock for a little while...seriously!  Work took us here one day for lunch and we all enjoyed it. 3 of us had the burger and two had soup with a side of chick peas and the grilled cheese and tomato bisque. Not one complaint among us.   Mark came over to say hey to us which was nice. Then, the owner of our company, was telling us great stories about the live music. Definitely need to check that out.   I would 100% go back for lunch and really want to try dinner or just come in for some apps and a drink during music!"}
{"text":"Disappointment! Sat at the bar and the bartender would obviously rather have been somewhere else. Should have called in sick with that attitude. \"Out\" of the highlighted items on the menu at 5:30pm? My wife's chips were stale. My green chile pork was obviously heated up as one portion was cold. The tortillas on the side were wet and fell apart upon handling. It's a shame as Tarbell's never disappoints. Will try one more time to see if it was a fluke. It was Monday."}
{"text":"I loved this place! My avocado grapefruit salad was the perfect summer salad.   My waiter suggested two wines which  were excellent. If you don't know what to try ask your waiter as they all seemed very knowledgable."}
{"text":"Quick and tasty drinks before Tarbell's opened and pleasantly surprised at the cocktail menu! They do not serve hard alcohol so I always admire the craftiness and originality restaurants come up with. My husband drank a green flash IPA and I ordered the sake champagne mojito. Fresh and tasty! We sat next to the window and enjoyed the rain fall and parents night out. Our server was attentive and made our transition to dinner awesome!"}
{"text":"Today i met a friend at Tarbell's for lunch.  I ordered the beet salad.  I was shocked at how small it was.  On a huge plate were about ten small pieces (not even  slices) of beets lying on a small amount of a cheese sauce.  That was all.  It was so small that my friend offered me some of her lunch.  It was good, but not worth the $13.00 I paid for it.  It should have been an appetizer not a lunch.  I was so hungry that on the way home, I picked up something else to eat."}
{"text":"I love this cozy place! Excellent food, service and people. Mark Tarbell does it right. I met a friend there today for lunch and we both had the patty melt and a glass of wine. Perfect place to catch up with a friend over a great meal."}
{"text":"Great we came here last night for my boyfriends birthday! We picked some wine form the shop and brought it over to the restaurant. We has some snacks that were ll really perfect! Definitely be back"}
{"text":"We went in on a Saturday Evening. Service was excellent, our server was very knowledgeable of the offerings both in food and beverage. The Manager Ty was incredible. He was very friendly and also very knowledgeable.   First off, huge fan of Chef Tarbell!  Things you need to try here: The Polenta Fritters All of the little Bikini (SP) Sandwiches The Sloppy Joe The Cheese Plate The Deviled Eggs (Out of this World) P.S. I don't even like deviled eggs!!  In the end, Good Food, Good Hospitality,  and Good Drink in a Comfortable Atmosphere; What else can one ask for?!?!"}
{"text":"The quality of food and diversity of cocktails makes this a 5* paradise!  Don't be a fool come to Tarbell's"}
{"text":"As if it could get any better!  On our last visit to The Tavern we were told that, instead of choosing our wine from a wine menu, we can go into Sportsmen's next door (pretty much in the next room accessed by a hallway), grab their wine guy to direct us to the stuff we like, check out the bottles in person, grab a bottle, have our server pour it at our table at The Tavern and get charged the Sportsmen's price.  Not even a corkage fee.  Even writing about it makes me giddy.  I do love these guys."}
{"text":"This was a great find! The pasta sauce is delicious (we even brought a jar home). The lunch menu was good but the dinner menu is what I'll be going back for!"}
{"text":"Dam good noodle bowl of Octopus Pho! Ginger & Fresh cilantro made the dish extra fresh and a soft boiled egg-- wow!  My husband had the hamburger salad - also a delectable delight! Always a great stop!"}
{"text":"Pretty quaint spot tucked away between Biltmore and Arcadia neighborhoods.  I love that you can walk right on over to their Wine Store, select a bottle, and take over to your table for no corking fee.   This place has a lovely, quaint atmosphere, not a ton too much seating and tons of low lighting that creates a glow on the wooden walls.  I went with the ricotta gnudi pasta for dinner - by the sounds of it, you'd think italian-style pasta full of marinara sauce right? Nope! This pasta is more of a hearty pot roast packed with slow-cooked au jus, vegetables, succulent pulled pork, and last but not least... ricotta stuffed gnudi pasta pieces! It wasn't quite what I was thinking when I ordered the dish, but it sure was tasty.   My one drawback was that the portion was a tad on the smaller size. It didn't help that it was served on a plate the size of a satellite either..it REALLY didn't look like I got much food then.  Solid little spot - give 'er a try!"}
{"text":"I am very late in writing my review which is a shame because this was one of the best meals I've ever had in Phoenix.  The seating is tight, it was very awkward waiting for our table in a walk way.  We were very much in the way of the wait staff and other patrons.  We had a large group and we were comfortably seated though.  What I ordered... what what I ordered is no longer on the menu... I'm actually really sad because the pasta I had was homemade flat noodles in a homemade apple sausage pieces in this sauce that was a dream.  I could not get enough of the sauce and I practically licked the plate dry (well as close to it since It is a nice place to eat and I tried to some some decency).  There was also this caramel rosemary cheese cake that was so fantastic that I was sad that no other cheesecakes could compare.  I've been writing this review while staring at the new menu that is published on their website.  I'm sure what is available now will be fantastic, I'm just also sad I can't go back and re-do this meal again.... it was that good.  I guess I will have to go back soon and try the new menu!"}
{"text":"This neighborhood spot is a hidden gem. We love coming here for dinner and drinks. The food is amazing and the staff is always friendly. I highly recommend this spot."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that I really liked Tarbell's and was excited to try the Tavern. You should note that the parking lot here is tiny and has complimentary valet. Anyway, I met my dad here for dinner and we shared the chilaquiles, a patty melt, and onion rings. The patty melt was alright, though the meat didn't fill the bread (and it probably should for 17$). It came with chips (which it does not say on their menu). The chilaquiles were fairly mediocre. They lacked in flavor and the portion was small. The onion rings were tasty.. nice and crispy. The service was efficient. The prices were very high for the food we got. I would come back if someone were taking me, but I wouldn't come back here on my own dime."}
{"text":"Last night was honestly the best dinner I've had!! Came here for my birthday n my husbands birthday w some close friends. My husband heard really great things about this chef and despite living in AZ for over 10 yes we never tried this place. Well I am so happy we did!! We started off w three bottles of wine. And got the calamari, escargot, octopus, Mac n cheese, n mussels as an appetizer. The calamari was lightly breaded w a great crunch and it came w two dipping sauces. My husband has never tried escargot and despite being a little weary to try it, he loved it! The octopus was giant and absolutely delicious n cooked to perfection! Needless to say, everything was heaven in my mouth.   I got the basil gnocchi topped with lump crab and my husband got the steak topped with crab as well. He thought the steak was phenomenal better than any of the ultra high end steak places we been to and the crab was a good portion and so delicious!! My basil gnocchi was amazing! The buttery soft and chewy texture mixed w the crab was to die for! I'm so glad I took some left overs w me!! Also my gf ordered the side of cauliflower and it was seriously the best!   Highly recommend this place for people who love great food and amazing selection of wine! I'm 10 pounds heavier from basically trying almost everything on their menu but the happiest!!!"}
{"text":"Tarbell's Tavern serves pretty much the best tavern food ever along with a great wine selection and extremely reasonably priced craft and import beers. Some of their dishes are the best in town- don't miss the amazing BLT, lobster roll and banana cream pie. You cannot go wrong!"}
{"text":"My husband and I came here for a glass of wine before dinner at the nearby Tarbell's on Valentine's Day this year.  There were a lot of customers when we came, but we were able to slip into two spots at the bar.  It looked like half the people were getting food and half the people, like us, were there for a glass of wine.  There were actually some reasonably-priced wine options, although of course they also had the several-hundred-a-bottle choices for you high-rollers out there.  Our favorite wine bar is Vino Loco, in Flagstaff, but we've been looking for a Phoenix equivalent.  Now all we have to do is see if they'll put up with a couple of people playing some board games while sampling their wine... next time.  :)"}
{"text":"We went with friends to the Tavern for dinner and a charity event featuring a great local band the MacDaddy O's. The food here is just as awesome as you get in Tarbell's main restaurant. Salads are large and awesome especially the the beet salad, very sweet with a drizzling of a light creamy dressing. My husband had the kale Caesar which is huge and easily could be an entree. My husband and I had the flat iron steak which was tender, had a wonderful spice rub and perfectly cooked. the potatoes Comte' was the perfect compliment with the beef along with crisp asparagus. We ordered a bottle of Barbera wine, a full-bodied red which was only $23.00. For dessert we shared the salted caramel chocolate mousse which was thick and chocolaty. All of our friends enjoyed what they ordered especially commenting on the scallop ceviche."}
