{"text":"OMG! this is the worst BBQ restaurant i have ever been! 

my cousin and i went there on a friday night. we've been craving for real chinese charcoal BBQ for a while. but this place is a total failure!!! we were there aroung 7pm friday night and we were the ONLY customers in the entire restaurant! i guess the reason they started this AYCE BBQ promotion (before it was Ã€ la carte) is because of lack of business and they wanna draw some attention by saying they are the only restaurant that offer AYCE charcoal BBQ. but Eeeeeek.......

EVERYTHING is super salty. we ordered some lamb skewers, kidney, squid and shrimp. the biggest failure is the lamb skewers. IT IS DEFINITELY NOT CHARCAOL BBQ. i guess it was boiled and deep fried. you can't ever smell any charcoal from it. the interesting thing is we could constantly hear the microwave sound (DING, DING) from the kitchen. we were the only customer at that time and we only ordered skewers, so what they used the microwave for??? i hope they didn't heat up the leftover skewers from before!!! the tofu skin skewer is a joke! it taste like you eat something straight from the salt jar...... we ended up drinking 2 big jar of water to cover the salty taste.... 

i would definitely NOT go back again. such a failure...... good luck to the business."}
{"text":"We five went there tonight for dinner, and I have to say I like their BBQ food so much. Long long time I have not eat better food. I will keep going this place forever."}
{"text":"Came here for Chinese BBQ, the place was extremely well kept. Noise level was minimal, I could actually have a normal conversation without raising my voice. Food came out pretty fast. Well seasoned and juicy skewers. Also I've been too many of its competitors such as Tiger, 1+1, and Harbin. Although this place isn't miles ahead in terms of flavor, they do offer some unique items that I have been craving since China. Chinese chives, pork skin, and fatty lamb kidneys are few examples. All in all, everything was above expectation, and price is decent. Would recommend."}
{"text":"Pretty good. Chinese BBQ is delicious, and cold dishes are so nice, so I like this place."}
{"text":"Surprisingly better than my expectation (which I guess were pretty low due to Titus' ratings)

Note: we arrived here at 10 or so and there were only one other couple, which may be why food was decent.

Overall, I would say the place isn't bad but the biggest problem it has is consistency and complexity of flavors. My favorites were the chicken cartilage, lamb kabobs, and shrimp.

First the bad, almost everything we ordered had the same spice mix which was good, but gets boring after awhile if u keep having different things with the same flavors. Another thing I found really bad was consistency. We would have 1 order of something and the first kabob would be too salty, and the 2nd one would be in dire need of more salt.

The good: for the price you're paying, it's honestly not bad considering most other ayce places are more in the 25-30 range. The lamb kabobs were generally pretty good, tender well seasoned. The shrimp was really crispy, so crispy that I didn't even bother with the shell.

All in all would come again....."}
{"text":"Do not come here. My friends tried to make a reservation for this place at least a week in advance since we were going to be a big group of 20 people. The restaurant said they didn't take reservations even though both times I've been there before it was completely empty, so I don't see why they wouldn't. This later turned out to be a problem because the kitchen was completely unprepared to serve this many of us.

Not to mention we went there with the intention of eating AYCE skewers. And I guess at some point in the last month they changed their menu from AYCE to a la carte. Of course they failed to mention this to my friends who tried to make a reservation.

After a bit or arguing the waitress begrudgingly brought out the AYCE order forms and handed us some wooden trays, one for each table. I did not know what they were for, but the bottoms of the trays were really oily/sticky (gross!). Then we learned that all the skewers she was going to bring us were going to be placed on the trays. During previous visits, skewers were placed on different small plates, like how regular dishes would be served. Plus this waitress literally had the worst attitude. She would ask us to pass skewers down to the end of the table when she could have just walked to the other side and delivered them herself...is that not her job?

The amount of food she brought out from the kitchen was abysmal considering it was supposed to be AYCE. It ended up being more like a tasting menu because she would only bring out enough food for each person to have one skewer or share a skewer. Even though we ordered 20 skewers of lamb, it took them 2.5 hours to serve each person their first lamb skewer. And everyone only got one. Everyone got one skewer of chicken, one skewer of fish tofu, etc. We suspect that whoever was in the kitchen just started defrosting all the food when we started ordering, and was frying everything in oil instead of grilling it. Because it doesn't take 1.5 hours to cook enoki mushrooms...

I also found hair on the skewered food. Twice. 

Save yourself the time and money and hassle and eat somewhere else."}
{"text":"This place is clean cut and a clear menu. The service was decent. However i have to say unfortunately most of their skewers were okay. But not great. I feel that the meat itself was the problem and not the spices. They had the right bbq spices. However the lamb and beef were overcooked. And could use a better marinate to make the meat softer. The oyser that was supposed to be bbq was also a problem as it had no bbq flavour. And felt like a steamed oyster. The cabbage was slightly undercooked. The buns could use some marinate. And the cucumbers were not good in the vinegar use.    The pork belly was probanly the only thing i would say was done properly and pretty good. Overall i feel minor improvements would make this place perfect. They  have a lot of little mistaked here and there. Which makes a 3 star make sense. I wouldnt highly recommend but if u are in the area sure"}
{"text":"Just awful. Only go there if you like eating deep fried salty variations of food. The waitress never washed her hands after picking her teeth and handed us the food right after. Could go on about this place but it's not worth my time. Just don't go here. The 5 star reviews are fake."}
{"text":"My family and I visited 520 BBQ House twice; once for snack, another time for all you can eat ($19.99 regular, $16.99 on Tuesday).

Skewers ranges from $2.99 - $6.99. Most items have the same flavour; salt, chili pepper, and cumin. Every item started tasting the same after the first two or three skewers. It masks the natural flavours of the ingredients. 

Similar to other reviewers, my favorite is the Enokitake mushroom skewer and Korean Cabbage. My family did not enjoy any of the meat skewers. They felt lamb skewers lacked the gamey flavour of lamb, beef skewers lacked the earthy flavour of beef. Lastly, chicken gizzard and squid tentacles skewers were very tough. As well, my father felt they used a natural gas grill instead of a traditional charcoal grill. 

Overall, 520 BBQ ranges from a 2 to 2.5 stars (rounded to 3 stars for this review), depending on the day."}
{"text":"My goto Chinese BBQ restaurant. They do all the staples well. My favorites are the lamb skewers and the korean cabbage. And they're all u can eat!"}
