{"text":"Whataburger, pronounced \"Wotta-Burger\", is a great alternative to McDonald's.  This particular branch has been there at least 25 years, because I remember coming here as a kid.  They've got your basic burgers, fries, onion rings, etc.and their prices are quite reasonable.  The difference bertween Whataburger and Micky D's is the meat is seasoned and flavorful and the buns are crispy and buttery.  Each burger tastes a little bit home-made."}
{"text":"Went here last year on a road trip to Phoenix for a game at Chase field.  This place was awesome for a McDonalds/BK alternative.  Great shakes and fries, burgers weren't too shabby either."}
{"text":"Sadly, this location at Glendale & 7th St is closed as of mid-July 2009. There's a Filibertos in its place now because the Valley of the retards just can't get enough of that chain.  The other nearby Whataburger locations are Indian School/5th Ave and Bethany Home/I-17, just north of the Shell station."}
