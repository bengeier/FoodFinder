{"text":"Ate a good pork and passionfruit arepa. They have a good soda selection, i recommend the apple flavor. You can sit outside in the summer which is nice. The service was good"}
{"text":"C'est un restau vénézuélien charmant. Bonne attention à la clientèle. Les arepas vénézuélienes sont leur especialité. C'est sûr que j'y retournerai"}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite restaurant in Montreal. True Venezuelan cuisine and great customer service. I'm celiac and they have plenty of gluten-free options and this is one of the few places that I've never had a problem with. I recommend the arepas and the corn tequeños."}
{"text":"I truly can't believe how this place doesn't have more hype on Yelp. It's packed and everyone seems to love it! I've been 2 times and both times it was out of this world. Highlights include the cheese and chorizo tequenos, the cheese and black bean empanadas and the pulled beef arepera. If you're ever on St-Laurent street and feeling some good Latino food or vegetarian/vegan friendly food, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Great place to try Venezuelan food but they also have other dishes as well, I highly recommend their pizzas and their sangria, I would say the best in Montreal."}
{"text":"Le lieu est sympa, dommage que l'emplacement au bord du boulevard Saint Laurent ne permettent pas vraiment de pouvoir manger en terrasse tranquillement. C'est la localisation qui veut ça. J'ai bien aimé la décoration. Le service est sympa mais pas rapide ni très prévenant pourtant le restaurant était presque vide ce jour-là! J'ai pris une arepas végé (avocat, haricot rouge, plaintain frites), assez bon mais je ne pense pas que ce soit la meilleure association possible. Par contre, les frites de manioc en accompagnement étaient délicieuses !"}
{"text":"This little Venezuelan beauty in the heart of little Italy is a must! People stop and stare because it is out of the ordinary. The arepas are perfect. Crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside, and that's short of the blend of flavors. Don't leave without trying their cachapas. Their service is impeccable."}
{"text":"The dishes were so yummy and it was exactly the same way of the original arepas! The meat tasted very good,but the cheese that they put inside could be better in terms of taste and quality! But overall I suggest here to anyone who wants to taste the Venezuelan arepas in Montreal!"}
{"text":"So far, this is my favorite Venezuelan restaurant in Montreal. I ordered and arepa and my companion ordered the mechada; both were delightful. I had the house spicy sauce along with plantains and avocado on my sandwich, which made it oh so very good. I need to go back soon, or else I might go crazy. Also the guy working Ramon was really hospitable. His coworker and him we're both trying to help us figure out the best part of town to move, since we were newcomers. It's joints like this that make me love this city."}
{"text":"Best place in Canada for Venezuelan food, everything is very well prepared so you may think that you are eating at any arepera in Venezuela."}
{"text":"The Bocadillo restaurant is shaped like a typical Montreal apartment: narrow and elongated, stretching from the street to a funky backyard. Don't get fooled by their rather small and unassuming shop front; they have excellent Venezuelan comfort food!  We had dinner in their backyard this summer and loved it. We ordered arepas (pork & passion fruit and Reina Pepiada). The food took some time to arrive, even though we were the only clients in the restaurant. The waiter did apologize and explained that the arepas are fresh made with every order. We didn't mind too much - the backyard was nice and private, and the weather balmy.  When it came, the food looked fantastic. The mix of chicken, avocadoes, green peas, mayo and coriander in the Reina Pepiada was particularly delicious. The arepas were filled to the maximum and although we didn't order sides, we were full and satisfied!"}
{"text":"Mon but était d'aller manger au Tre Marie mais il était fermé pour les vacances.  J'ai donc marché vers Saint-Laurent et il y avait Bocadillo juste au coin de la rue. Je n'avait jamais essayé ce petit resto vénézuélien et je n'ai pas été déçu. Ils offre une cuisine simple et authentique.  Simple parce que les plats principaux sont principalement composés de sandwichs. Je n'ai pas été déçu.  C'est très bon et surtout, très savoureux.   J'ai essayé les frites de manioc, c'est différent des frites de patates, ça vaut la peine de les essayer. Pour l'ambiance, il y a des télé qui diffusent en boucles,  de belles images du Vénézuela.  Il y a aussi une terrasse mais avec la chaleur qu'il faisait, j'ai préféré le confort de l'air climatisé à l'intérieur. Bref, pour un repas simple, rapide et savoureux, c'est un resto à essayer!"}
{"text":"Great people serving better food. Rustic, homey / personal feel. Ask to be seated in the back terrace, it's classic plateau"}
{"text":"Venezuelan gem. I usually order for take out since I live closeby. Arepas are always fresh made, with good meat and fillers. Arepa pabellón with avocado is my personal favorite. The only downside is the unpredictable closing hours: they will close whenever the place empties up, so better call before heading there."}
{"text":"This place was really cute. My friends and I wanted to try it out, first time we stopped by it was closed...we didn't give up and came back hoping a second time and it was open!  We got the Mechada and Pabellon Arepas...they were delicious! Really hot, we almost burnt our mouths from the juiciness that came with each bite:-D   The service and atmosphere was nice too, really causal and chill. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Une place dans la petite italie où on mange des plats sud américain, pourquoi pas !  J'ai adoré mon arepa, les frites n'étaient pas les meilleurs du monde mais ca allait tout de même ! ¸Le jus servi était bon mais fau revoir la politique des pailles complètement pourris qui se torde quand tu aspires ... Oui pour un jus épais cela ne sert A RIEN ... Le service était par contre laborieux et pourtant le restaurant n'était pas remplis, déception de ce coté la ! Ils possèdent une terasse sur st laurent ou sur la rue perpendiculaire qui permet de se poser dehors  Si vous êtes de passage dans le coin et que vous cherchez à manger autre chose que les pizzas et pates du quartier vous pouvez venir vous réfugier ici :)"}
{"text":"If you want to have bocadillos, go to the other location at the beginning of Saint Laurent. This bocadillos has similar dishes, but not done as well as the original location. The service is lacking. Everyone there is very nice, but not attentive. When ordering take out there are often many mistakes made. The portions are off as well, the yucca is expensive and you get maybe 6-8 pieces. If you really want to experience great Venezuelan food, go to their original location, that's where the heart and soul is."}
{"text":"Found this place accidentally. Not looking for arepas, but boy did we luck out! I had plantain, cheese and avocado with a side of yucca chips. The buns were made out of corn flour and super fresh. The guys were friendly and the music was good too. Highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Love, love , love! Nothing bad to say about Bocadillos. It's open late, it's consistent, it's flavourful, it's not too expensive, and the staff is so friendly. I'm so happy I'm moving near this restaurant, I'm gunna be there all summer long! It always tastes fresh. And the cachapas are to die for (and that avocado sauce)."}
{"text":"Original et intéressant. Quelques plats sont peu goûteux et fade mais il y en a des bons."}
{"text":"One of the best places to eat late at night on St-Laurent. This place beats any other fast food joints. Doesn't look that appealing, but this place is like a white dude with dance moves - full of surprises."}
{"text":"Restaurent vénézuelien, bouffe des caraibes presenté avec une twiste chic, savoureux. Belle grande salle à manger, musique typique sudamericaine, bon service, bcp de choix."}
