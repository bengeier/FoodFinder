{"text":"Just plain good Mexican food.  Taco salad has been our favorite.  Chimichangas are next in line.  I'm a fan of consistency and we've had that taco salad three times now in the past month.  Yummyyyy!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I ate lunch here today and it was not good. My fish taco was gross and she ordered an enchilada, but the cheese wasn't even close to melted."}
{"text":"This place is not pretentious and down to earth. very simple and affordable Mexican fare. It's comparable to los favs.  Carne Asada Fries are my favorite.  Great mexican place within walking distance from ASU."}
{"text":"The only reason this place has a high star rating is because there are nothing but stoned/drunk college students eating here.  Save yourself the disappointment and hit Taco Bell instead...  =\"}
{"text":"Always great food. My go to mexican food in Tempe/Phoenix. Quality food and always a great price. Highly recomended!"}
{"text":"I was looking for a place to get a quick bite for lunch. America's was closed so I looked up similar places and this restaurant showed up. I got the Carne Asada burrito special and it is absolutely amazing. It comes with guacamole inside and a side of rice and beans. If you're looking for a delicious Mexican meal feel free to come here and enjoy."}
{"text":"Great specials, the carne asada  burrito, at great prices. Loved the free chips and salsa plus the ASU student 10% discount. Clean, friendly, and great service. Best Mexican food near ASU!"}
{"text":"They have really good affordable Mexican food. I recommend the Al Pastor Plate. It's honestly some of the best Mexican food you can find around here."}
{"text":"Better than Filli's or Armandos. That's all I can really say. It's definitely not four/five stars tho. The staff is nice. It would be better if they had good salsa. Theirs is watery and... just not very good."}
{"text":"Went here for the 1st time today after reading all the positive Yelp reviews. Had a potatoe, egg & cheese burrito and it was perfect. I'm a sucker for a fresh flour tortilla and this place definitely had me at first bite. I've tried a few Mexican places around town and this is my new favorite. Breakfast burros from Fiesta Burrito in North Tempe usually have bits of eggshells in them, Los Faves in south Tempe usually has a long wait, but this place had no wait and no eggshells! Also can't go wrong with the free chips and salsa bar & the friendly staff."}
{"text":"Great burritos and enchiladas the jalapeno 's are spicey and good! the place Needs \"red sauce\" or good salsa but food is great."}
{"text":"This place is by far my favorite spot in tempe . Proudly, I eat here 3-4 times a week. Carne Asada is amaZing . It literally feels like home here . The lady at the front is always nice. And the cook in the back always has a smile and says hello to me every time . California burrito, breakfast burrito, and many other choices are my favorite . I love this place!"}
{"text":"Had a great bean, cheese, potato, and rice burrito. Also had the carne asada fries. Great prices and great taste. Please stay awesome!"}
{"text":"Los arielitos is very comparable to Los favoritos except it's open to 2am on the weekends which is bomb. Burritos here are bigger, there's free chips and 10% off for asu students! California burrito and steak and egg breakfast burrito are bomb!"}
{"text":"On 4/7/15 I stopped by with a coworker.  He had the Carne Asada tacos and I had the Asada plate(15).  Long story short, what we were served was not Carne Asada.  I don't know what kind of meat or animal that came from, but it was thick, chewy, and fatty.  It was disgusting.  On the upside the chips were good.  Disappointed they are passing off \"mystery meat\" as Carne Asada in AZ."}
{"text":"This place is a diamond in the rough!! The unsung hero, whatever you want to call it! I was blown away by how good it was, especially for how cheap the place is. $5.15 for a carne asada burrito?? You cant beat that! There was another place that was a few steps away that recently went out of business that charged wayyyyy too much for their food. Dont get me wrong, it was very tastey food, but it was also way overpriced. It should'nt cost $13 for lunch at a taco shop!!! This place has great quality and flavor, and it didn't break the bank! Give them a try, you wont be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"Really really good. We got a chicken burrito, Carne asada California, carnitas taco and shredded beef taco. I ate the chicken burrito and it was so good. Wasn't like 76% rice like some other places. My friends said their food was super good too. Well I'll be back"}
{"text":"I work across the street from this place and we've been waiting for a good Mexican food place in our neighborhood. We frequent the other establishments in this neighborhood for lunch and this is by far our favorite.  They have really good food, the prices are more than fair, it's very clean, and a smiling face always greets you at the front door!  The California burrito for $4.80 is awesome and at least one of our employees has one every day."}
{"text":"Had a chicken burrito but it was ok but towards the end it was way too watery. It was messy and frustrating to eat the last quarter of my burrito swimming in chicken juice. Great customer friendly service And chips bar."}
{"text":"Great mom and pop taco shop.. I've gotten the $6.50 special twice and the carne asada fries once, both very good. It's much better than your regular mexican fast food! Cheap too. Would go back, esp with ASU 10% discount."}
{"text":"A solid little taco shop located conveniently (for ASU students & staff) at the NE corner of ASU's Tempe campus. Easy to drive right by on University. Just look for the small strip center with Fed Ex in the front and a variety of ethnic food offerings in the back.  Fast service, great for carry out or dining in their small seating area. Chips and salsa available for those who dine in. Wish there were more choices at the salsa bar than just a red and a green sauce. Love their tacos. Went for a basic beef taco special on this day. Delicious. Not quite as strong on some other items like enchiladas, but solid enough.  Discounts for ASU students and daily specials make this a great option for the university crowd and others nearby. I'll be back."}
