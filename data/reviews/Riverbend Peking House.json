{"text":"The owner is fantastic! Food is great everytime I order from them. It's always a hit when I bring the food to potlucks."}
{"text":"Stopped here for an impromptu lunch, 

The decor is nothing spectacular but service was polite and the food was good. The buffet selection is small but had all the Chinese buffet regulars - soups, dumplings, spring rolls, fried rice, chow mien and the meat dishes. 

I went with the lunch box deal-fill a to go box for $10 plus they throw a free drink or soup in the mix. 

Good food, decent pricing. Added to my list of lunch haunts"}
{"text":"This was the nastiest type of mall Chinese food there is. We were unfortunate enough to stop by for the lunch buffet.  The ginger beer and sweet and sour pork was all breading with no meat.  The singapore style noodles were plain, without curry or any filling. The won ton soup had no flavor, but plenty of won tons.  After eating here, I'm pretty sure food poisoning is in my future.  You're better off eating at the Chinese counter in CO-OP."}
{"text":"We go to Peking Peking on a regular basis, we always dine in at the buffet thus I cannot comment on ordering from the menu. This is a family run business which appeals to us, it is also the only restaurant I go to on a regular basis that gets closed for a few weeks a year while they all take their vacation (usually travelling together). 

The buffet is square which I agree is unusual, I suspect this is a make the most efficient use of your space kind of thing. I've never known it to be a problem, people usually just line up behind the last person, you get the odd nutter going against the flow but that just serves as a reason to bond the rest of us together in are common quest. 

Calgary has a wide range of buffet sizes, stretching to restaurants that advertise over 100 items. We like the size of the buffet at Peking Peking, it offers a sufficient selection but more importantly the food gets turned over on a regular basis. The few times I have visited the large buffet restaurants I have noticed a lot of the food selections have been sitting around for quite a while and therefore very suspect. The selection is a typical Western Style Chinese buffet in a local establishment. For a modest buffet they manage to include 2 noodle dishes, 2 meat & veggie dishes, 2 soups, plus the usual suspects (e.g. ginger beef, fried rice, etc). One things we do enjoy (I'll warn you right now this is odd) are the chicken wings. Yes chicken wings at a Chinese buffet. These wings are salty sometimes however I still enjoy them, I just stop at one of the local drinking establishments on the way home to address the situation. 

We enjoy Peking Peking when we want to partake in a Western Style Chinese buffet. We go elsewhere when we want something else."}
{"text":"Great Chinese!! I've noticed that the takeout or delivery is better than the buffet.  If you want the best bang for your buck (but not the best quality compared to delivery) then go in and load up a lunch or dinner box at the buffet and its only like 12 bucks.  You can feed 2-3 people from a properly loaded box!  Pumped to have a solid Chinese joint near my new home"}
{"text":"Great little Chinese place! We've eaten in and done takeaway many times and it's always very good. The buffet is a particularly good value for the money as they have many different dishes that are refilled often. Ice cream and cookies for dessert which is always a hit with my nephews. 

One of my gauges for a good Chinese place is the salt and pepper squid. It's got the perfect amount of breading, just a little spice and isn't overcooked and chewy. The ginger chicken is also a favorite, and the Cantonese chow mein is one of the best I've had. They certainly don't skimp on the meat and veggies on that one.  Also they have beef and snow peas!! Give me that over beef and broccoli any day. 

We ordered takeaway the other night for 5 people and I found it to be very reasonable with a fair bit leftover the next day. 

The service is also fantastic! Always friendly and very attentive when eating in. We're very lucky to have this gem in our neighborhood!"}
{"text":"I was pretty disappointed. We order some food to go from Peking Peking. Our included Almond Chicken, Ginger Beef, Spring Rolls, Fried Rice and Beef and Broccoli. Here were our thoughts on the food: 
- Almond Chicken: I never had Almond Chicken made this way. It was breaded and deep fried and very dry even with the sauce they included. I usually have had veggies with my Almond Chicken; this has no veggies. An arteries delight. 
- Ginger beef. Decent. A little tough to chew but not too bad. 
- Spring Rolls. Decent. 
- Fried Rice: Bland. It just seemed like regular rice that had some pea tossed into it. It didn't look little fried rice at all. 
- Beef and Broccoli. Beef was tough to chew. 

We wish we could have given it a better rating but we'd rather drive an extra 20 minutes to go to the Mighty Mango in Millrise to get our Chinese."}
{"text":"This place was pretty good. We stopped in while running errands on a Saturday for a quick bite. I admit I was surprised how small the buffet was but it had all the required items and a couple more. The food was fresh, tasty and the service was great too.  I am kind of past the time in my life where I want 32 items on my plate anyway.  It was slow when we were in there and one item was getting low. When the gentleman working there saw me take some of what was left, he assured me more was on the way and wanted to make sure I had enough to start with.

The price was right, the taste/quality was good and there was service with a smile.  What more do you really need for $10?"}
{"text":"My daughter and I stopped in for their take-out ten dollar lunch special. It was a small but okay buffet selection with the option of sit in or a take out box: spring rolls, ginger beef, fried rice, vegetable dishes etc.. It was okay, but not remarkable. The price seemed fair with the drink included."}
{"text":"This was possibly the worst buffet I've ever been to. Don't waste your time."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for a quick lunch after ready good reviews of this place. I have to say, it was good, but not great. The buffet had a good selection and the price was reasonable. The food itself tasted pretty good, but definitely not the BEST Chinese food that I have ever had. The atmosphere was really gloomy and the overall look of the place was shabby, which contributed to the low rating. All in all I would go again, but wouldn't go out of my way."}
{"text":"The food here is by far some of the best Chinese I have had!  The price was amazing as it was a buffet style.  They didn't really have a server so all we got to drink was water!  The place was kind of dirty and they had just stuff filling up tables!  It's like the didn't have enough space in the kitchen.  This place gets 4 stars because the only thing bad was the ambience which was actually pretty bad.   Thank gosh for the food being so good it's saving this place from going under"}
{"text":"Everything is fried.... Never had such greasy Chinese food before...

I ordered take out one evening excited from reading the first reviewer that gave it 4 stars. Well I was very disappointed. The almond chicken was greasy and dry, the ginger beef leathery, the kung pow again all deep fried breaded chicken (what are they guys thinking?) and the cashew chicken overcooked. The fried rice was almost white; flavorless and poorly made.

Stay away from these guys and stick with a good Chinese restaurant such as The Mighty Mango in Midnapore."}
{"text":"This little restaurant is right in my community of Riverbend.  I walked in for the first time on a Friday after work, and it was absolutely packed (good sign of a good restaurant).  It's a smaller place with only a few tables (maybe 20) and there is a la carte as well as a buffet.  The buffet is also takeout, so I got 2 take out cartons for $11.50 each and filled them up at the buffet to bring home to Rich and I.  

Everything I had was quite tasty.  The reason why I did not give it five stars, is because the buffet was quite small variety-wize (even though it was tasty), and the small buffet was on a big square table, rather than a long skinny one, so there was no natural start and finish line, so people were coming at the buffet from all angles, so it was a quagmire to get your food, and figure out what direction the buffet was moving (clockwise or counter clockwise.  However, when I finally got out of there with my food, it was admittedly, quite good.  Also, I don't know too many places you can get dinner for $11.50, so I thought it was a bargain.  So, I can understand why the restaurant was packed."}
{"text":"I have been a faithful customer of this restaurant for as long as I have lived in Riverbend. 24 Years now and have never been disappointed. Cost perhaps a little higher than others but you definitely get what you pay for. Top shelf quality food"}
{"text":"My favorite Chinese restaurant ever! The buffet is small but the items are excellent! Very tasty and not greasy like a lot of other Chinese places"}
