{"text":"UGGGGHHHH! DO NOT ORDER FROM HERE! After the new year they got new management and all new employess. The food was absolutely terrible. They are now the \"New Chen Wok\" and they suck so hard. The soup was like jelly. The rice- crunchy not done. Where the hell is the flavor????? Gone. Very upsetting. I've been going there for three years. I even called and told them off. Lost this customer for sure. That's just too bad.  Anybody know where the old owners went? I'd like to find them."}
{"text":"As with any Chinese restaurant in AZ you have to try all their dishes and check off which are your favorites on the take out menu and file it for later.  This is a family owned business and I have been there many times.  Always friendly adults taking my order,  never kids as I have seen in other reviews.  I personally do not like the lunch menu and the way it is packed.  I order my items separately.  I recommend the lemon chicken, moo shu pork with plum sauce, crab rangoo, orange chicken (you can tell them how spicy you want it) and the same with Singapore mei fun.   They are very accommodating as to what vegetables you want in your dishes, how spicy etc. I am so tired of trying to find the perfect Chinese place in AZ that I now have several lists and only order a few items from each that I know are eatable.   Most Americans don't even know what real Chinese food is.  Tried jellyfish?  Chicken feet?  Sea cucumbers?  Shark fin soup?"}
{"text":"Uhh what happened here? Ordered orange chicken under new management. Horrible. Bring back the old recipe fast."}
{"text":"I have been going to this place for years and like it even better with the new  management. My favorite is the chicken teriyaki. My husband basically orders whatever he wants and they make it special for him. You DEFINITELY get your money's worth. They give you large portions and it is very delicious. The staff is friendly, the place is clean, and I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Tried  Chinese   food  several miles around 83rd and Thunderbird  wasn't  satisfied  .looked on Yelp and seen reviews work New Chen Wok .ordered Imperial  Seafood Gourmeti specialties  .the best I've  had  in a long time"}
{"text":"I'm from Cali and have been searching for Chinese food like home, and my cousin told me me to try this place. I always go by a Chinese places orange chicken, egg flower soup, & egg rolls lol I know I'm weird but I know what I like  Lol anyhoo this place had very good orange chicken, fried rice and low mein and egg flower soup best I've tried since getting to this hot state, I didn't like the eggs rolls though it was to doughy instead of the crispier wraps the use.  But overall excellent food kudos!!"}
{"text":"I used to order from this place when they first opened, after they put a menu on my apartment door. My favorite was the House Special Duck and the Imperial Seafood. Today, I was recovering from a painful surgery and when my Mom asked me what I wanted her to bring me for dinner when she came to visit, I suggested picking up Chinese from here. Big mistake! This place has gone downhill big time! I wouldn't be surprised if they're about to close their doors! First of all, my Mom said that although the lady behind the counter was nice, the place was kind of dirty and there wasn't a soul in sight. But the big disappointment was when I dug in and started eating! The food was not fresh and the House Special Duck failed miserably in comparison to what I remember when I ordered it a few months ago, and it didn't even taste like duck (I wouldn't be surprised if it was just chicken and they just added duck sauce). But worst of all, the bag of fried wonton chips that go with the soup were so stale that I can't believe they actually had the audacity to serve them! I still have that stale taste in my mouth and I only put a mouthful in my mouth before spitting them out! And since I had already put them in the quart of egg drop soup, I had to throw the soup out too! And for the hefty price, you'd think you'd at least get a quality meal! New Chen Wok, what happend? You just lost a customer!"}
{"text":"We had to pick up some food on the way to mother-in-laws house and found this place online and decided to give it a try. When we arrived there was no customers in the place except a child doing homework at a table.  We placed our order and several people in the kitchen got to work cooking.  The food was very good and there was a ton of food. Four of us ate the food and there was enough left over for two of us for another dinner!  I would go there again if in the area."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food in Arizona period! We come from Brooklyn NY and it's hard to find good Chinese food here until now. Boneless spare ribs knocks it out of the park even better than NYC."}
{"text":"Omg I'm from the east coast and Arizona's Chinese food doesn't compare , UNTIL I had a flyer placed on my door. The fried rice from new Chen wok is BOMB tastes just like back home on the east coast!!!! Chicken wings were great and I also ordered French fries (common with chicken wings lol) excited to try more items from here. I figured get the basics on your first try and everything was excellent."}
{"text":"I gave one star because not giving any wasn't  an option. My family and I ate here after church ever sunday. My mother, a friend, and I ate here last week, My mom and I had food poisoning the next evening. The most disturbing part was their lack of concern and how unresponsive they were when my mother, who only called out of concern for others, informed them of our sudden illnesses. They hung up on us without question. Needless to say, we will definitely not be back!"}
{"text":"Always really good food. My family always get orange chicken and beef and broccoli and also chicken noodles. Really good service always pretty fast. Great food"}
{"text":"Very disappointed. Big greasy mess. Food was hot but not sure if it was the cook or what but all we tasted was grease. Never again and I would not recommend this place to anyone at that time of night atleast."}
{"text":"With  the new management the foods were so much better,their fried rice was amazing, I normally never order fried rice at chinese restaurant.the portion was big specially the soup, definetely will be back.."}
{"text":"I've eaten at New Chen Wok 3-4 times and I like the food a whole bunch.  They make the food fresh (you can hear them clanking and sizzling in the back after you order).  They never seem to be very busy, but they are pretty quick.  Like some other reviews I did notice that there were no adults around, which is a bit odd.  The only reason I gave 3 stars instead of 4 is because they would only sell me orange chicken in a large size and all of the other entrees in a small small size.  What if you don't need that much orange chicken???  The only other thing to note is that (as of this writing) they proudly display their \"B\" from the health department..which ALMOST made me skip it.  All in all, I'll eat there again though."}
{"text":"We were craving Chinese but didn't want to drive to our normal place to get it so I found this restaurant that delivers & had our food delivered to the house.  It took 1hr & 40min to be delivered. Now in their defense it was a cold & very rainy night, I think half the people on my street had take out delivered to them.  We ordered the following: 1). Salt & Pepper Shrimp (too much batter & no salt & pepper taste), 2). Vegetable Chow Mai Fun Noodles (unflavorful), 3). A small Chicken w/Garlic Sauce (tasty) and 4). the House Special WonTon Soup (the broth was brown which was strange to me for a wonton soup but tasted Ok).  Even though the delivery wait time was considerable, I will give them a 2nd chance & order delivery from them one more time to see if on a clear day their delivery time is faster. We'll also try a few different entrees to see if we can find a really great one we like. It's just so hard to find a Chinese restaurant that delivers & has great tasting food."}
{"text":"Simply amazing!!!! We are from Brooklyn,NY in the military and we have need looking for New York style Chinese food every where the military sends us. The staff are extremely friendly and the food is New York style Chinese food. We will definitely be regular customers."}
{"text":"We've been ordering either take-out or delivery from here once every month or two for the past 9 years. We like Chinese every few weeks so we've tried many of the other restaurants in the area. Even so, we always find ourselves coming back to Chen & Wok over and over again.  I even went so far as to take one of their menus and check off items I had previously ordered, then ordered something new and different, and wrote a little review for myself for each item. I have eaten probably 95% of their entree's and found that the ones I didn't like were personal preference and not because of the quality.  As I said, we find ourselves gravitating back to this restaurant time and time again. That should say it all.  I give it 4 stars instead of 5 because I rarely give 5 stars."}
{"text":"A small fast food, family owned establishment ideally for takeout or delivery. Upon our arrival we opted to dine in here. Our order was taken immediately and our food was served promptly. Everything came out to taste. Their portions are huge. I had the house special chicken with lo mein that could of feed 2 people. My meal also came with an eggroll and 3 fried wonton. The next time I'm in town, I'll have to try the beef chow fun which my sister said was satisfying."}
{"text":"Our first time visiting.  Excellent service, huge portions and great flavor!  And they deliver!"}
{"text":"**Edit: I added this New Chen Wok page because when I looked up the business on Yelp, the page with this address was listed under the name of the old restaurant, but that page has since updated the name...so there are now two pages for New Chen Wok.**  This place used to be Chen & Wok, but has new owners and is now New Chen Wok.    I was shopping in the area and wanted some Chinese takeout.  I remembered there was a place near the Fry's.  It's small with a few tables to eat in, but I'd classify it more as a takeout joint.  The young man at the register was very nice and answered my menu questions.  I decided on the Moo Goo Gai Pan combo and it was ready in less than 15 minutes.  I got home and was so impressed to find such fresh, perfectly crisp-cooked vegetables and tender chicken in my dish.  I was not expecting it to be so good.  It's the best Moo Goo Gai Pan I've had in years.  So good!  (see photo)  Portion was huge, and the combo came with pork fried rice and an egg roll for $7.50.  I shared it with my son, and still had leftovers.  I'll be coming back for more takeout soon.  Can't wait to try other dishes.  A new fave."}
{"text":"Chen Wok, is our local go to restaurant here in Phoenix, It's take out is always delicious and consistent. It's got that NY Flavor that is comfort food for me. Soup ++++ Wontons++++ Noodles++++ Take a chance on everything, Btw: The staff is always Friendly, this is a Small Business that needs to be supported. Go for the Yum Factor, stay for the fast delivery and take away"}
{"text":"Good pricing fast service. Food was awesome and their pork egg roll  is my favorite around. They were open christmas day. I had surgery earlier in the month and still not up for cooking. So i was thrilled they were open. They will be open new years too. Good to know"}
{"text":"I really have nothing bad to say about NCW.  The food was actually great: orange chicken wasn't overly sweet, sweet and sour was exactly what you'd expect and the egg drop soup was very packed with egg, which is rare.   Here's what I feel it could improve on: drink offerings (they only have cans) and the fried rice was really thick.  Other than that, I would eat here again."}
{"text":"This place is super tasty. We have only ordered delivery so I can't comment on the actual restaurant. The delivery is super fast usually. Also the price can't be beat. It has become a go to on our rotation. We love the orange chicken and the mu shu veggies. Also the fried rice is amazing. We always get white rice to for free which adds to the value. I do not recommend the crab puffs though, it was just friend dough no cream cheese or crab in it."}
{"text":"!!!!!!!!   beware   !!!!!!!!!!!!   food is disgusting.....nasty red cheap egg rolls. lo mein  is loaded with msg..... i am really feeling sick after eating there over priced nasty food......"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem. I'm a huge fan of orange chicken and I've finally found a place that is better than Panda Express. The service was great, the dining area was clean, our order was out within 10 minutes and the food was terrific. We will be back...a lot."}
{"text":"I love this place. My coworkers and I get a take out order there every couple weeks. They're always fast, tastes great, and friendly. Most of the time they will throw in some cream puffs for us without us asking. I would highly recommend it, especially since it's a family owned place."}
{"text":"Tried this for the first time today. I was very impressed with each the food and the service. Chicken with black bean sauce was excellent and the sweet and sour chicken was meaty and not greasy. Not many tables for dine in. Prices were very reasonable and the place was very clean. Will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"The price is right and the food is good. The flavors are a little on the bland side. One of my favorite menu items is the chicken wings and those shouldn't be a favorite at a Chinese place. The cuts of beef and chicken are a little weak and less desirable and usually overloaded with batter. The shrimp however is decent in size. There is better out there but if you live close and want cheap and quick try it. I haven't given up yet and keep trying new items. I know there is a nugget in that place waiting to expose itself!"}
{"text":"Great food. Sometimes the lo mein is a bit greasy , but it's still delish! you definitely get what you pay for here."}
{"text":"This was our first time eating here, and it was their first night open! It was delivered in a half hour piping hot. Delivery man was very friendly. I got the Mongolian beef and it really was the best I've had. Egg roll was crispy and delicious. My daughter said the orange chicken was \"the bomb\". I will order from here again!! Price was right too!"}
{"text":"I used to eat at \"chen wok\" on 31st and thunderbird like nobody's business. Sadly they closed that location I saw this \"new chen wok\" and thought it'd be the same thing and to give it a try.   This review isn't based off the food because I didn't even make it far enough to order anything. Atmosphere of places really influences my decision of wanting to eat certain places and I'm a creature of habit so this is especially true to trying new food.   I was the only one in the restaurant. 2 kids about ages 7-8 were chasing eachother around Nobody else was to be seen. when I walk closer to the front counter one of the kids goes up there and starts trying to take my order.. Still don't see any adults..   I ended up changing my mind and walking out.. I feared he was going to prepare the food too."}
{"text":"Despite living across the street, I have avoided trying New Chen Wok because the reviews since their management change are kind of rough. But tonight I happened to be at Frys and decided to give it a go.  We ordered a large chicken with string beans, a large hot lover's chicken and a wonton egg drop soup. Total came to just over $20. We paid and our to go order came out shortly after.  The hot lovers chicken was like a spicy sweet and sour, but with veggies. The chicken and green beans tasted fresh and had a light sauce. I liked the wontons in the egg drop soup. Everything was hot and not too oily like some local spots.  I'm unclear on how the recent reviews have been so low. Perhaps we caught them on a good night or maybe I'm not as picky as the other reviewers. I will try this place again. It reminded me of the quickie chinese joints i used to frequent around Army bases when I was enlisted."}
{"text":"Orange chicken was not great. Pork fried rice was dry.  Only thing good was the egg roll.  Not nearly on par with the original on 7th street.  Would not recommend."}
