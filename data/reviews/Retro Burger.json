{"text":"Philly cheese steak is the item someone told me to try from here and I've never looked back. Love this sandwich especially spicy. It's the best. One of my coworkers suggested the Greek fries but I've yet to try it cause when you add that with the sandwich it adds up. That's the only thing I have to criticize about this place. The prices are high."}
{"text":"Friendly service and nice decor.

Burger patties were terrible. As good as those you get for free at picnics and what have you. The regular fries are a bit greasy and below average.

I couldn't even finish the burger or fries.I actually think Mcdonalds is tastier. Tragic I know.

Haven't tried the fried mars bar nor the philly steak sands or the dogs, though. Those might be good."}
{"text":"This place quickly became my favorite burger joint in my area.  The burgers fall into the 'greasy spoon' category of burger.  It's not a gourmet burger and it's not cheapo fast food but it is a great burger.  I'd compare it to Apache Burger out in Etobicoke or Dairy Freeze which is further west on St. Clair.  The poutine and greek fries are also really good although the burgers are so big i barely touch my fries each time i go.  

Can't really comment on any other of the food items as I've only had the burger.  My girlfriend had the chicken burger once and didn't really like it.

The older guy who makes your food is really nice and always has a corny joke to tell you."}
{"text":"This place is still the sickest!!! Great people, good food, clean & thats the perfect combo for success!!! If u dont try this place your crazy!!! Never mind those other negative comments about this place, its a good place to go!!! So what if its pricey, to eat good quality food? You gotta pay for it!!!"}
{"text":"Was really excited when I discovered a new burger place was opening in the area. With The Burger Priest and The Great Burger Kitchen already establishing a strong foothold, I was expecting a strong contender.

Instead, I found a highly disappointing establishment.

Food: Whether they are or not, patties and fries taste frozen. Cheese is processed; once I saw that happening, my spirits sunk...there is really not much else to say. There is a Greek spin to the food, you can get poutine, but really, I don't have the heart to write about the food.

Atmosphere: This is decidedly a fast food joint. No attempt at design or comfort, this is a get in and get out quick kind of place.

Service: The service was really great. Nice friendly, helpful people. I wish they would go somewhere that deserved them.

Finally, both my partner and I experienced a bout of gastric distress after the meal that we agreed was the nail in the coffin--never going back. EVER."}
{"text":"I was craving a cheese burger and ordered one with fries and gravy.  Was satisfied after the first bite but the amount of grease and processed old frozen meat plus kraft cheese. it gave me bad news. Not the freshest!"}
{"text":"Has a nice, modern look at the same time as feeling less \"corporate\" than other fast food places (tye orange is a good look). The drinks are refillable and they seem to use very little water where there should be soft drink (McDonalds) and moderate costs for a fast food establishment. Tasty burgers, if not always done evenly, and overall an above fast food joint to eat at. It also has really good WiFi from the neighboring library."}
{"text":"Sorry guys got a 3, was attended to well, location is great, menu seemed good.

Where I think you may have let yourself Down, it appears burgers are not made on site or the ordered Cisco stuff? And for me it about the meat!

Will come back when they change they meet"}
{"text":"Had the burger with cheese and a hot dog. Burger was good, service was good but the hotdog wasnt to great.i would go here again, definitely a better alternative to a fast food joint like Harvey's etc..."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I recently moved to Ajax and this is our go-to burger place when we want take out! We would visit this place when driving east even before we moved.
Their burgers are very VERY reasonably priced for the portion that you get and the food always tastes fresh and delicious. And the service is always fast and staff friendly."}
{"text":"As name suggests, retro vibe!! Don't expect poshness.

Burgers (5oz) are so flavourful, deff more than what you pay for (think thick and juicy. Toppings are somewhat limited to the works + some (sauteed onions anyone?). Love the retro sauce - NOT for the healthnut.

Poutine ahh fries are thick and crispy, and not over salted. (Sometime somewhat bland is why it loses a star)
Gravy, yum. My fav is the crispy chicken poutine :) works on own as meal or side for the hungry.

Fish and chips went beyond my expectations! The batter is soo tasty and crisp, and a generous serving too! 

Hooked since my first trip last year!"}
{"text":"Fast friendly service, fair prices and clean.

Best fast food in Ajax!"}
{"text":"Very nice and inviting atmosphere. Got the Philly steak, and it was amazing. They also have deep fried Mars bars! Didn't try it, but will definitely go back."}
{"text":"First let me say the food actually isnt bad, very overpriced but still that alone would not stop me from going back. Issue was just as mentioned before, food safety. Im no expert but you cant go from a grill dealing with raw meats and then shove your hands into toppings without so much as washing hands or putting on gloves. Its just so unnecessary, how hard is it to toss on gloves. Again quite a shame as the food, despite being super pricey, is actually pretty tasty."}
{"text":"Stopped in for the first time yesterday, the servings are immense. Great burgers! Music playing was CHUM (I think), didn't really compliment the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Haven't had much but poutine and Greek fries but do far pretty amazing. They give you a great portion for a reasonable price and good home food that fills you right up.I'm looking forward to trying a veggie burger, veggie Philly as well as the sweet potato fries.Perfect customer service"}
{"text":"I love that I can call and order ahead of time before I pick up. What's even better is that the wait wasn't that long. I ordered for 3 people so I expected about a 30 minute wait. It was only 10 which was nice. Service was great.

The burgers were pretty good. Nice thick patties which were cooked to perfection. My son had the bacon poutine and he said he never thought bacon poutine would have so much bacon haha. I guess it was a thumbs up from the little dude. Price was reasonable. THese days paying an arm and a leg for burgers seems pretty common nowadays anyway...

It's not the greatest burger I've ever had...in fact there are no burgers which stand out for me right now. But I will admit it was a tasty burger!! I would get a burger from here again, but next time I want to try their 'real' milkshake."}
{"text":"First time trying this place.
The restaurant is very clean, and the service is extremely friendly and welcoming.
There is quite an extensive menu of delicious options. Today we ordered burgers and fries.
The burgers were delish and the fries.....they were \"those kind of fries\" - so yummy, crisp and fresh!
We will be back again for sure."}
{"text":"Retro burger.  Not so much retro anymore.  Is that some type of coating on my fries?.  I think so.  Or, they changed the oil.  Either way, not as good as in the past."}
{"text":"I stopped in last week for lunch. I got the 5oz bacon cheese burger, fries, and a Pop.
First up the fries, fresh cut, and they could not have fit more fries in the box. They were already falling out onto the tray, The burger was quite tasty, lots of bacon and it was juicy and hot. The pop, cans of pepsi products. I will go back, they have wings, and I'm always looking to try new wings, and I also want to try the Poutine. They have a few tables and chairs, but seating is limited to about 4 tables that can seat about 8, as well as a counter with 4 seats."}
{"text":"Not a bad place if you wanna keep it simple. The Greek burger and the Greek salad with chicken are all good choices. Just not great."}
{"text":"I wanted to like retro burger but alas this is a fast food burger place disguised as something better.  I knew once that sign went up on the side of the building that started listing things like fish and chips and deep fried Mars bars that it was not going to be what I expected.

The burgers are frozen patties, the fries are frozen, the gravy packaged and the toppings of processed cheese and the usual suspects are not all that interesting.  Really for the combo which is fountain pop, burger and fries the price is $8.  You can get the exact same burger fries and pop at square boys down the street for $4.25.

The cheese curds on the poutine are fresh so I will give them a star for that, and the service is quick & polite another star.  Other than that won't be back.

This used to be Mr. Subs should have stayed with that format."}
{"text":"So i ordered the DOUBLE ( so they claim) souvlaki dinner. Tastes ok.....but for the 15.99$ without a drink even I felt ripped off.  Totally looked like they too one medium sized chicken souvlaki and tore the pieces in half to try make it look bigger . I did see it was two very skinny chicken squers . I wouldn't recommend that meal to anyone. Unfortunately now a days restaurants cut so many corners to save a buck because so much of the public don't say anything when they get screwed."}
{"text":"Went here because a friend insisted it was great. I think his peanut allergy has clouded his judgement because this was just average. It wasn't bad. Just meh"}
{"text":"Quality: 4.5
Price: 4 (factoring in quality and taste)
Taste: 5
People: 5
Wait time: 4
Preparation: 5 (hot, fresh, made at time of request)
Ingredients: 4 (the spices and sauces are perfect, but the fries are too soggy)

I heard great things about this location, and I wasn't disappointed. I'd probably give this place 4.5 if I could, only because $12 for poutine is a bit pricey, but I can't argue much about the ingredients, heat, customer service, and taste. The poutine fries aren't very crispy, I suppose is another complaint."}
{"text":"This is a regular place that I go to for a family meal, either eat-in or takeout. Great burgers, chicken and fish sandwiches. A simple place with a good range of food. They know what they are good at. I will say that they don't always listen that well at the burger toppings station. And the front door is always hard to open!"}
{"text":"As the currently reigning duke of Retro Burger, I implore you:

DO NOT EAT HERE!!!   RAW MEAT CONTAMINATION

I have always been sketched out by the fact that they prepared my veggie burger on the same grill as the beef burgers. Additionally, I was mildly annoyed that they offer a deal on beef burgers in the afternoons, but there is no similar deal on veggie burgers. Nonetheless, they are conveniently located close to me, so I have eaten here several times.

However, on my most recent visit I observed one of the staff touching raw meat and then touching both my bun and veggie patty. When I (tactfully) confronted him on this behaviour he told me that he had wiped his hands on a cloth.

Now, I didn't  observe him doing this, but it doesn't even matter whether he did or not. Having taken several food handling courses I can assure you that wiping one's hands on a cloth is not sufficient to prevent cross-contamination. He should have changed his gloves and washed his hands.

I decided not to eat this burger. I also decided that I really didn't want to have them make me another one. So I left. I think that the least they could have done was offer me a refund, but they didn't.

I'm aware that this sort of thing goes on all the time, often behind the closed doors of the kitchen. But nonetheless I find it repulsive, and I do not intend to return to Retro Burger. I'd urge you to avoid them as well."}
{"text":"Tasty burger, overflowing with toppings, o yah! This was waiting for me in Scarboro when I visited. And these guys are fast, wow. In just a few minutes I was asked what I wanted for toppings, all the usual which were fresh and good. Nice thick patty and soft white bun accompanied by thick chunky fries overflowing in their cardboard tray. I went for the standard 5 oz cheeseburger combo but some of their other items looked interesting like the Philly steak sandwich, and the $3.99 milkshake, mmmmmm, maybe next time. I'm not sure of a stand-out favourite akin to the legendary voluptuous onion rings served up at what we used to affectionately call 'Harry's Lube' up on Lawrence and Kennedy, but there could be, only a matter of time to figure it out. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Yum! Love this place. They have the best poutines, Greek fries and philly/ chicken Philly cheesesteak sandwhiches for a burger place. Burgers and salads are also amazing and made with care. Owner and staff is also extremely nice and friendly. Fresh toppings and speciality toppings like Caramelized onions, tzatziki and other sauces. Prices are reasonable and the restaurant is clean and inviting. I would definitely recommend this place over Texas burger."}
{"text":"Great tasty burgers. But to mention their poutine! The Philly steak poutine is fulfilling and will make you confer back."}
{"text":"The cheeseburger was ok but really thin & obviously a frozen patty. The fries were ok, but the gravy had no flavour. It tasted exactly like fast food, it was meh."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING.

I can't believe I lived in Pickering/Ajax for 10 years before discovering this hidden gem on Bayly. 

Great family sit down place or good for take out the staff here are the friendliest I have ever seen the owner is incredibly nice really gets to know his customers and always makes you feel welcome and the staff are the same way I have to say I am extremely impressed I hadn't seen the level of customer service I get at Retro Burger anywhere else.

The food is great, I have had their Philly Cheese Steak numerous times it is by far the best Philly I have ever had in Ontario, honestly eating a Philly at places near by like Kelseys, Shoeless Joes etc... those expensive chains Retro Burger's $8.00 Philly Cheese Steak puts these to SHAME! You have to try it with their hot sauce. My only complain about the philly is the the bun isn't the greatest it just can't handle all that philly and sauce so when I get home if I don't eat it quick enough it gets soggy but still good.

They have a burger special of $2.49 for a burger between 2-5 PM I believe and the burgers are great. 

I haven't had much else other than their poutine (also good) but I visit frequently. 

Keep up the excellent work! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

Cameron"}
{"text":"Small but cozy. Really has that retro feel with decor but I like it, something you see from 50's burger shop. I went with a 5oz burger, filling thou 8oz would been nice option.

Still have to come back for the Philly cheese"}
{"text":"Awesome food ,awesome staff and fast. Sweet potatoe fries ..Ya baby! !!!  All they need to add are whole wheat buns ;-)"}
{"text":"Had a Philly with poutine.  Sandwich was good.  If I had to criticize I would say a little too much sauce, but I don't so I won't.  Poutine was really good.  They use what seems to be real gravy and real curd.  Cashier was super friendly and her physical appearance only slightly distracted me from my tasty lunch (she was pretty)."}
{"text":"Great food! I've tried a few different options from the menu and haven't been disappointed yet. 
Staff is always very friendly."}
{"text":"Really great! Fast, friendly service, generous portions and it's pretty cheap! Best veggie burger I've ever had!"}
{"text":"Sooooo, I finished my workout and needed some sustenance yeah, yeah, I know not the healthiest option...but I really wanted to try Retro Burger.

I was greeted by a short rotund man, very nice. I actually asked him what the most popular items were...he answered  \"the philly cheese steak\"  I was down for that and a cheeseburger! Yes I was hungry.

So, much like the other reviews everybody mentions the frozen patties...the burger was decent much like you would find at a typical Greek owned \"cheeseburger, cheeseburger, cheeseburger\" joint. I kinda expected the burger to be exactly that.

The philly cheesesteak was again nothing crazy, but it was good.

You can't walk into this place expecting the be all and end all of burgers...like the sign says \"charbroiled\" and that's what you get.  It still kills Mcdonalds!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few times while working in the area and I can say I am a real fan. The staff have always been friendly and patient while we make up our minds about what to order and get distracted chatting with each other. The fact alone that the cashier will engage in conversation with you sets the service miles ahead of Burger King. I usually get the veggie burger (which is so delicious that I can almost guarantee it's cross contaminated with real meat juice). It's a large burger and pretty juicy for a fake patty. The real star, though, is the poutine. As much as I tell myself every time I am not going to get it I always do. It is the only place in Toronto I have had squeaky curds. And not just once. Every time. I've been to the two major poutine chains and neither have ever served me squeaky curds. Retro totally wins. Minus one star because it costs a little more than I like to pay for a burger and fries but hey nobody is perfect. If you're into beef burgers, though, there seems to be a special every day for 2.99 or something like that."}
{"text":"Burgers from distributor. Fries weren't anything special. Don't let the signs outside fool you, this place was a huge disappointment."}
{"text":"I was hoping to find a better cheap burger place than Harry's Drive In, so I came here today to check this place out, as Retro Burger has cheap burgers as well.

The place wasn't busy in the late afternoon. It is a small place, a few seats, but most of their customers are take-out customers.

We tried their 5 oz burger with fries combo, and had a beef hotdog as well. Total came up to approx $13.

The burger was good. It tasted better than the Real McCoy burger. It did not have that frozen patty taste, the size was good. It is a good portion, as the patty was 5oz. Burger was cheap and it tasted good.

Hotdog was good too, quite tasty, and it only cost about $3.50. I just wish the bun was smaller, but just a-ok.

Fries could have used a bit more salt. Their gravy was a bit bland too.

Over-all not too bad to go for a quick bite. Food was ready in only 5 mins.

{"text":"Fun place, friendly service, great food!  Just found this place and what caught my eye was their heavy promotion of their Philly Cheese Steaks.  Growing up in Niagara Falls, that city had the best Philly Steaks, otherwise known there as the 'steak sub'.  Never been able to find a good Philly steak outside of Niagara since I left (except in New York City, they were awesome there).

Anyway, tried the Philly Steak at Retro Burger and it was awesome!  Still not as good as what you can get in Niagara, but by far the best I have been able to find so far.  I tweaked the sandwich a little bit... asked for no hot sauce (normally they add mild, medium or hot), asked for hot peppers instead of green peppers.  The rest of the sandwich had fried onions, mushrooms, cheese, toasted bun.  It was great!  Next time I go I'll also add diced tomatoes and shredded lettuce.  Then the sandwich will be complete and as close to Niagara's version as I can get, for now...

Fries, onion rings and the atmosphere all great as well... enjoy!


Here's my perfect Philly Steak from RetroBurger...
- Double Cheese
- Fried Onions
- Fried Hot Peppers
- Salt and pepper while frying the meat

(See my review on Pete's Big Bite, has even better Philly Steaks!)"}
{"text":"First time at Retro. 

Good tasting burger.  Bun was a little flat and squished.  But the overall taste delivered.  

I'm not a fan of frozen premade onion rings. I much prefer fresh homemade but again these were not bad and they gave a fair portion. 

Also, pretty fast service during the lunch rush. 

Good job."}
{"text":"Fantastic service. The burgers are juicy and very tasty. Me and my son love their poutine; specially the bacon poutine. Fish and chips are as good as any in the GTA and the Philly Cheese Steaks are top shelf!"}
{"text":"So, I was craving a burger and thought I'd try something new, and Retro Burger was it. This location has been a bit of a revolving door of take-out foods, and they haven't changed any of the lay-out, so I knew where to order and pick-up, etc. Really, all they changed decor-wise was to turn everything orange. You don't see THAT everyday!

Extensive menu - lots of burger and non-burger options, including chicken shwarma and gyros, and salads. Boring me, though, I got a cheeseburger and fries. I thought the cheeseburger stacked up (see that?) pretty well against Hero and the other competition, and the fries were really really good. Not fat-free for sure, but good! Staff was nice, too. Also, they cook the burger and then allow you to dictate the toppings. There is a good selection of toppings and lots of sauces too.

Fair prices, good service. I wouldn't say no to a return trip. Just not too often, cause those fries are NOT diet."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a cheap burger, come here. If you're looking for a good burger, go elsewhere."}
{"text":"We had a cheesesteak and fries here. The cheese steak has such a tiny amount of meat on it for almost 10$, it's a rip off. I imagine part of the reason (other than being cheap) they use such a small amount of meat is because they are using a hot dog bun, which is the wrong type of bun to use for a philly cheese steak. They shouldn't call this a philly cheese steak, it's not at all like a real Philly cheesesteak. The fries were good though."}
{"text":"After a long Friday at work, was looking for a cheap place to get food from on the Danforth and I entered Retro Burger! I had a poutine, was cheap and good! The fries were a bit overcooked to my taste but i still ate the whole thing. 
Staff was friendly and smiling!"}
{"text":"It took 1/2 hour for me to get a simple burger and onion rings and by the time I did, the rings were cold. I asked for fresh, hot onion rings and they tossed the ones I had back into the oil, so I ended up with overcooked, greasy onion rings. So, no. I won't be back."}
{"text":"I'm not really a burger fan to be honest but this place was not bad! Super friendly staff and really fun environment. Really got that retro vibe down; all they're missing are some old arcade machines and a gumball machine. Haha

The food is great too! Talk about a great deal! Burgers are mostly 5 oz but they are not small! Patties are juicy and filling! The poutine though, is huge!! Very homely and they put so much cheese on it :) love it! Ohh and those watching their wallets, it's $5 for this huge thing. I really should have just called poutine... It's a meal in itself haha"}
{"text":"Super impressed with the tastiness of these cheeseburgers! I've eaten here several times now and they're consistently delicious....and ditto the Philly cheese steak sandwiches, but beware, those are big suckers that'll have you busting at the seams (in the best possible way). 

Personally, I would skip the Greek salad and the crispy chicken sandwich, although my hubby likes the crispy chicken, so it's just a matter of taste. Oh, and if you like your bacon crispy, then Retro does it just right....there's nothing quite like a little bacon cheeseburger to brighten your day :) Amirite?

Anyway, this is just a simple, no-frills burger cafe so don't expect anything fancy or gourmet....just expect one helluva tasty, \"that-hit-the-spot\" burger. Oh, and super friendly customer service to boot.

Well done, y'all!"}
{"text":"This is a great junk food place! I go cause its nearby but they have some pretty good poutine, burgers and hot dogs. Don't get the milkshakes! They are very friendly at this place, I always tip them just from their kindness. Their gravy is also nice and thick with actual cheese curds. It's a fast food place, I think if you like Harveys than you will like this. But it's better cause it's 50's themed and they have heart."}
{"text":"Great greasy food.  prices are pretty high, not the gourmet burgers like other places, but decent food and you will get full."}
{"text":"Veggie Philly was delicious !! Great customer service as well. Must go place to grab a quick bite. 

Oh... and did I say Veggie Philly was delicious?"}
{"text":"Should have heeded to the previous reviews. It is a small place with very little seating. Prices are generally reasonable. Looks rather like a hole in the wall, but that's okay...

The big problem is that the food was literally inedible. I got a Greek wrap and the chicken wasn't fully cooked. I couldn't stomach it. My husband got a burger and also could only eat a few bites. The only thing that was okay was the milkshake.

Seriously, stay away."}
{"text":"It was my first time going to Retro Burger and the customer service and burgers here are amazing. The first thing i pay attention to when going to any burger restaurant is the size of the burger and the patty itself. The patty was nicely grilled and delicious. 
I HIGHLY recommend going here during 2-5PM if you want a delicious burger for a low cost. In my opinion, their poutine is better the Swiss Chalet's and for the same price, its uncomparable. 

I'm deffinately going back!!"}
{"text":"While my wife and I were out, we just picked a place to eat at random, and ended up heading into Retro Burger. Sure, the table top arcade you can see from the window may have held some sway, but we didn't know what to expect.

We had a burger and fries, and a fish n' chips. Both were great; the burger was generous in size, and the fries, although not that great in portion, were fresh and crispy. The fish was actually really good for a burger shop, and I found the batter to not be overly thick, or soggy like you'll find at Chippy's far too often. Sadly, there was no coleslaw to go with the fish.

The price is not fast food cheap, it might even be a bit on the expensive side for those looking for a quick and cheap lunch. The meal itself is satisfying and fresh though and the staff was friendly.

We'll visit again when we're in the area."}
{"text":"Walked in ordered \"The Big Chicken Souvlaki\" it's smaller then every other restaurant on the Danforth! Chicken was moist not dry but that's all I can really say! Chicken needed to be marinaded in some sort of seasoning, trying to add that oil last min doesn't really help in the flavor of the Souvlaki. I also up sized to the Greek fries! Yep they added Feta and oil and vinegar and called it Greek! I don't think I will be back."}
{"text":"For old school burger and fries, this place rocks.
They claim the burger was 5oz. but it seemed much larger than that.
Well prepared burger all the toppings were fresh cook was very friendly.
And the fries, so many so well cooked.  Excellent fries.  Also had the gravy and they do a mighty fine gravy.
I'll definitely be back to Retro, they are among  the top old school burger places I been and I've been to plenty."}
{"text":"I ate here before when it was the previous owner and this place rocked.
Saw the new sign go up a couple years ago and figured they just cleaned up their act. Traveling into Scarborough with my Redneck steak eating finicky Felix buddy. Figured this would be a good place to chow down and not have to hear about it for weeks about how i forced him to eat somewhere again.
Gotta say he never had his mouth empty to complain.
He had their signature Steak & Cheese with fries and couldn't finish it. He was a very happy camper.
I decided to check out their burger with cheese and bacon with onion rings. Substituted for Swiss. Pretty tasty stuff. Lots of topping choices. Chewy bun, fresh ingredients. Really filling burger. The onion rings were out of this world. Fairly sizable crispy chewy batter with good sized onion in them. A huge helping to boot. 
Top notch
Service fast, friendly, helpful.
Place really nice and clean unlike the previous establishment.

Definitely gonna hit this joint again soon."}
{"text":"Funny how through all the waiting, the fry guy can't seem to get with the program and time your Onion rings so they're hot when you get your burger.

Over all it's a small place with limited seating with too many people waiting. Doesn't seem to be as good as the other Retro Burger's so i guess it boils down to the staff.
Most of the time it's dirty since obviously they haven't assigned one of the many staff behind the counter to clean.

Best bet is to go elsewhere"}
{"text":"I love this place! Deep fried mars bars
The burgers are really good I go here rather than across the street to McDonald's. I only get burgers here and have never had a problem with them. A decent burger joint in the neighbourhood"}
{"text":"I had lunch this afternoon at Retro Burger.

I ordered the 5oz burger combo with a side of gravy.  The fries are freshly cut.   The gravy was hot and flavourful.  The burger was good (I had mustard, ketchup, tomatoes and pickles on it).  I like that the bun was soft and lightly toasted.  There are free refills on the pop.  It's a big meal and, though they were delicious, I didn't finish most of my fries.

I'd stop in again if I was in that 'hood and craving a burger and fries."}
{"text":"I usually bring my lunch to work but I didn't today.

Retro Burger opened a couple months ago in the area where I work so I thought I'd check it out.

They have a wide variety of burgers (single, double and triple patties), fries, onion rings, poutine, fish and chips, etc.

I ordered the 5 oz burger (single patty) combo.

The burger and fries were fresh and hot. You pick the condiments for your burger ... I had mustard, ketchup, relish, tomatoes and a pickle. The bun was really soft (just the way I like 'em) and heated on the grill. The fries weren't greasy at all.

For $7.88 (including tax), it's a good deal."}
{"text":"This is such a great place to stop and grab a bite! Would easily choose it over the crowded McDonald's across the street. I adore the deep fried mars bars! Fries are great too. Meat isn't always the best but overall is a great local business and deserves more recognition than I've seen it get."}
{"text":"Location is a little out of the way and the parking is hard but the place itself is very friendly and the food is great. 

I wandered in and ordered the Philly and it was great. Sauce was very interesting. A little more pricey for burgers and fries but I would say that it is worth it."}
{"text":"Ordered the 5oz cheese burger combo with fries and a chocolate shake. The flavour of the burger was very good, the fries are run of the mill nothing special, the milkshake was good and creamy. The price is pretty good but for a whole family of four the price does get up there. The atmosphere is very nice, and was quiet busy for the late afternoon lunch. 

Overall, I would say if your in the area and hungry it's a good place to eat, but I wouldn't make any special trips to Retro Burger."}
{"text":"Best new burger joint in town!!"}
{"text":"So straight up, this place is better than the big fast food guys but not as good as the gourmet places like Craft, Hero, or Oh Boy.

The prices are very reasonable with a combo eating your wallet for a mere $6-10. The menu is quite diverse with a range of burgers, fish & chips, and souvlaki. If you've got a hankering for some county fair artery clogging-type food you can also opt for a deep fried Mars bar.

I went with simple on this particular evening and had the 5oz cheese burger with sweet potato fries and a Coke. The advertising in the joint proclaims that their sweet potato fries are actually crispy. To my surprise the advertising didn't lie, they were crispy; though obviously coated in something.

If you're in the area this a a good pick for a fast meal that's a little better than the same old clown burger. It's also a good option if you REALLY like the colours yellow and orange."}
{"text":"I have passed this place as I didn't know what to expect.  It updated the sign with bright orange colours a while back and I heard good things about the burgers.  So finally I decided to try it and wasn't disappointed.  The interior is pretty basic so don't expect anything exciting but the burgers were really good.  You have a choice of fixings which is always nice and better than premade process burgers.  The fries were pretty good too.  I liked the funny signs and albums on the wall.  It made for some fun reading while I was waiting for my order (which did not take too long).   It is more of a takeout place so get your burgers and enjoy them at home or go to Bluffers Park!  The next time I go, I will have to try out the other menu items.  The prices are pretty reasonable.  They have a picnic table outside but it is right by the parking lot so I prefer to take my food home and enjoy it there."}
{"text":"Here comes yet another player in the ever thickening Toronto burger market. Just south of Yonge and St. Clair on the west side of Yonge, Retro Burger is a fast-food style burger shop that's so orange, nothing rhymes with it.

Their menu offers 5oz beef burgers, hot dogs, chicken burgs (and souvlaki), fish (on a bun or with fries), philly cheese steaks, poutines and if you're feeling stupid: green or garden salad. As I'm currently dabbling in vegetarianism, I opted for the Veggie Burger combo for $7. It's a decent amount of food and the skin-on fries are actually pretty solid (especially with the shakers of seasoning). But the veg-burg was not nearly the best I've had and in this burger-filled town, you gotta bring it.

That said, there are so many options on the menu, including an intriguing \"Big 10 Belly Buster Burger\" (it's double the meat, bacon and cheese) and a feta poutine that could be all right. I'll give this place another shot when I'm back on the meat bus.

Obligatory Title Pun: RETRO Burgers won't make HISTORY.

Menu Readability: Very retro type on an oh-so-orange background. Bon!

Need to mention: One of their bottles contains \"Retro Sauce\" a combo of BBQ and mayo and nostalgia.

What this place teaches me about myself: I never want to ride on anything called a Meat Bus."}
{"text":"Food is very good, prices are a little on the high side. Fish and chips are very good, the only fish they offer is cod, burgers are very good as well as the fries. They have a classic poutine that is one of the best in the city. The atmosphere is good, nice throwback feel, staff are always friendly. With wifi, the place would be great, and with better pricing the fifth star would be earned. Parking is not an issue."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch today. Got the 2 gyro wraps for $10 deal. 

Chicken was fresh and flavourful. The place is really dated, but it adds to its character. This is a greasy spoon and it shows! 

Overall the food was great, the prices were fair and I left very satisfied. I will definitely be returning, and would definitely recommend this place to family and friends who are looking for some greasy spoon BBQ!"}
{"text":"Finally Canada has redeemed itself with burgers in my book. The last time we were out here we went to a couple spots where the burgers were horrible. Retro burger is a great spot. Burgers are chargrilled and you choose the fresh condiments you want on your burger. Next time I'm trying a cheesesteak."}
{"text":"Great little burger joint the staff are friendly and the burgers are awesome.  My husband and I are regulars."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised - the fries are delicious, the food is fresh and the portion sizes are great!

Only letdown is that it's similar to fast food places where you have to order your food up front and wait for them to prepare it. I was really hoping for a sit down atmosphere where a waiter would take my order, but that wasn't the case. 

I will definitely be coming back for the fries!"}
