{"text":"This Little Caesars is located on Bayview a little south Elgin Mills in Richmond Hill. There's a decent amount of parking. Upon entering, you'll notice it's quite small, there are huge windows, lots of natural sunlight but not many seats for customers to sit and eat.

The pizza always tastes great. I love going to Little Caesars over Pizza Pizza because one, their pizza has a lot more flavour and secondly, their \"hot n' ready\" pizzas save a bunch of time.

I've been going here for the past 7 years. Never disappoints!

4/5!"}
{"text":"Ready to go pizza and make your own pizza. Price is too high for the quality of the pizza to be honest. 

We ordered a deep deep pizza but instead of pepperoni, we swapped out for chicken instead. In addition to, we added toppings like olives, onions, and green peppers. And the last thing we ordered was a creamy garlic sauce.

When we got home I immediately opened the garlic sauce to see if it was garlicky but it wasn't. It was just ranch with a hint of garlic which you can barley taste. I'm surprised how the title was miss leading.

Lastly, the pizza had barley any sauce and the pizza itself barley tasted fresh. You can tell that the chicken was probably frozen..."}
{"text":"I get excited when the $11 box set comes back. It consists of four slices of pepperoni deep! deep! pizza and ten pieces of Italian herb bread. It is the main reason why I love Little Caesars. 

I recently did a staycation in Markham. I needed to figure out where the closest Little Caesars was on my way to the hotel from work. This location came up. 

I have passed by this location a number of times. It's in a plaza with other services and eateries. There is a ton of parking. 

I walked in and was greeted enthusiastically by a young woman. She indicated that she had just made new batches of the box set. I'd have to wait for about eight minutes. I was game. 

There are some fun hockey sticks that you can buy for $2 each. All three versions were available. I got the one offered during the first week. 

This store has the greatest number of seats that I have seen at any Little Caesars store. I was impressed. This store is clean and nicely organized. 

I got my food and was asked whether I needed a bag. That gesture was nice. I was good with taking my box and marinara sauce to my car without a bag. She also gave me a bunch of napkins. 

I got to my hotel. I sat down and ate. The food was delicious, as expected. I had plenty for lunch the next day and then some. 

Whenever I am in the area and need my Little Caesars fix, I'll come back to visit this store.

{"text":"We have to organize a school pizza lunch event. The manager is very friendly and gives us some recommendations what the best deal to get.  The pizzas are fresh; my kids love it.

It offers some very unbeatable daily deals like $5.55 Medium (14 inch) Cheese / Pepperoni pizza. They always have a few ready-baked pizza when you order one or two, so I don't need to wait for long time.

The only downside is they don't do delivery."}
{"text":"We love it because its always served fresh and hot. The crust is always soft & sweet with cornmeal all over the base that add extra texture and flavour, and the toppings very meaty.  It offers the best pizza of its kind (franchise and price range)!  My kids are crazy about it like how they are with pasta & meatballs.

They have our faves ready-to-go like the Pepperoni, and a usual wait of 10 mins. for the Canadian. Yeap, they really need to be consistent with their marketing \"Hot-N-Ready\" for the Canadian pizza.

The cheese bread is so good - soft, moist - and their selection of dipping sauces, that add more kick to the already great tasting pizza, is a fine variety. I love the creamy garlic, spicy cheddar and chipotle.

Its a take-out & delivery place with very small seating area.  With a tv on, its a nice quick lunch or snack stop.  I like the staff, always nice and cheerful. And we enjoy the chance of seeing them kneading the dough at early hours."}
{"text":"Had the 'deep dish' bacon wrapped pizza out of curiosity to see what the hype was all about. Basically it was just a normal pizza with a super thin strip of bacon around it. Not even close to a deep dish and the toppings were microscopic bits of bacon and the look of the pizza was unappetizing.  

Not worth the time. at least it was only 13.99"}
