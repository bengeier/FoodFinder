{"text":"The best panini in town! My salmon panini was delicious and even came with freshly made italian salad! Yum! Totally recommended! The place itself is quite cozy and plays good tunes! Great menu of coffee and sandwiches!"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised with both the food and the service. Loved the panini plate I took! I mean, who would expect a fresh tomato salad with green pesto, olive oil, boconcini chese, and fresh basil leaf of top! The panini just melts in your mouth. Definitely a place to discover."}
{"text":"Je repasserai pour mieux juger. Jolie petit casse croute et bon café expresso. Le propriétaire faisais ses impôts sur la seule table, fait que c'est drôle."}
