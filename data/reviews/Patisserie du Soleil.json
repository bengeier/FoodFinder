{"text":"Located in the Bow, this is the secondary location for Patisserie du Soleil, a cafe serving coffees, grab and go lunch items and French pastries.   You will not find the usual giant muffins and sugary squares here. Rather, the pastry case is full of more delicate items including sable cookies, cannoli (a particular favourite of mine), and tarts.  In addition to baked goods, this location also offers coffees and teas plus the standard lunch fare of sandwiches, soups and salads.  The prices are fair if a little on the high side. But, you can stop by on Fridays after 1pm to take advantage of half price sandwiches and salads plus BOGO on the pastries."}
{"text":"I am impressed for the price and quality it was pretty good. I got a mango and peach smoothie and I have to say for less than $4 that is a killing deal. It was made out of real fruits too. Price so unreal. The price for the desserts are very good as well too. I did find the drink a bit sour but overall it was not bad  Their pastries are quire reasonably priced too."}
