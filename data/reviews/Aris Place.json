{"text":"I eat breakfast here about once a week. The ladies know me be my name. This place is a bit of a hole in the wall that is filled with regulars.there isn't much natural light  butt its clean.  Its like an old greek diner.  On the weekends you can find  alot of people there. The breakfast is cheap and good. I pay about 8 -9 bucks including tax and tip. If I come down for lunch (rarely ) I always get the homemade burger ( make sure you say homemade)  its good. The gravy is meh , but it works. Its not a place you would bring mom for mothers day but its a great place to eat hangover breakfast and catch up with friends while saving yourself some cash. By the way cheap cost does not mean cheap meats... which can be the case in some  places."}
{"text":"This is a great place to stop into and grab a delicious and inexpensive breakfast - especially before 11am because it's even cheaper!   bacon & eggs, over easy, brown toast and coffee. please and thank you.   I try and make it out just about every weekend to enjoy GREAT bacon. When the in-laws were in town they were brought here and enjoyed the breakfast (read: bacon) so much that we went there every day that they were in town.   I haven't really had anything on the menu other than their breakfast, which as far as I'm concerned is as good as it gets for a classic greasy spoon breakfast.   Also, the weekend staff is pretty choice. There is one waitress there who rules so much that my girlfriend asked her what section she works on which days to ensure that she would serve is. She was stoked and not creeped out which was awesome."}
{"text":"Not bad but nothing special. Normal expectable brunch. Average price average portion, average service."}
{"text":"Our local greasy spoon. Great place for a fried egg sandwich and a side of onion rings."}
{"text":"Aris is another good place to get a cheap 'n' greasy breakfast on Roncesvalles. Sadly, long-established places like this are becoming rarer on Roncies, especially after the disappearance of the very-similar Red Flame not too long ago.  Started by a Greek family (not, as with many places around here, by a Polish one), Aris Place is nevertheless focused more on standard greasy-spoon fare, like burgers, steak and eggs, and stuff like that. Not haute cuisine, and certainly not a flashy place, but the value is excellent and great if you're a fan of heart-clogging classics."}
{"text":"A greasy spoon that offers extremely good prices on its reasonable food. Service is good and the atmosphere is always pretty relaxed. It's the perfect place in the neighbourhood if you want to get breakfast at 3pm - on a budget."}
{"text":"It's a diner. The food is good, and is served up fast. The servers are fast and are nice. A good place for bacon & eggs. It fills up fast on weekend mornings. Prices are good. A good place to eat."}
{"text":"Typical neighborhood breakfast place. Not expensive, friendly and good breakfast"}
{"text":"I really like this place. This is diner food as it should be. The bacon is crisp, the coffee is hot and the service is really good. My one complaint is that the home fries leave alot to be desired. The onion rings are really great and so are the home made burgers."}
{"text":"We were looking at a 40+ minute wait outside of The Ace so we decided to try Ari's next door. That wait time really worked in our favour. There was a table ready for us right away, the prices were low, the food and portions fantastic. The service was a little curt but warmed up nicely by the end. The kitchen staff were all super friendly and welcoming. They were really busy but we all got what we ordered, no problems there. My steak and eggs were cooked to perfection - rare and sunny side up. And the coffee was hot and strong.  If you're in the area and looking for a proper brunch with no pretensions you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"I have been going to this restaurant since I was a child. It's a great place to start off with a good breakfast. For lunch and dinner I always suggest their burgers or their souvlaki. Their gravy is out of this world. The prices are pretty good and the staff are extremely friendly"}
{"text":"it is what it is, and that is a solid throwback to when diners were simple, food was simple, and coffee was charmingly shite.    I felt awkward after i asked if they had an espresso machine.  tip: they do not have an espresso machine. I didnt realize how much of a downtowner i had become!  this place put me in my place and i cherished it.    great prices, people, and chow.  will be back"}
{"text":"Greasy diner type breakfast place.  Its exactly what you expect it to be. Nuff said."}
{"text":"Fantastic breakfast at a reasonable price (for Toronto) Great old school diner with a friendly vibe. Would return and try non-breakfast items like burgers and souvlaki. Yum."}
{"text":"Classic diner. Good food. Good service. Good portions. Reasonable price. A real staple."}
{"text":"\"Mega breakfast\" the best breakfast ever !!! I also come some afternoons and I eat their hamburgers that are awesome as well ! I recommend this place the guys in the kitchen are very kind and cook delicious :D"}
{"text":"Aris Is open again! And mercifully the only update seems to be a fresh paint job and new flooring. Still the same old great Roncy Diner with the same menu and prices."}
{"text":"I'd give this place better marks but when I ask for a few more home fries cuz my gluten allergy means I can't eat the toast I'm told \"they don't do that\" by the waitress. It's ridiculous that I have to order two things to actually leave full and they're too cheap to replace some toast with a tiny bit of extra potato. As if potatos are going to make or break their profits. They certainly broke a repeat customer. It's busy so maybe the owners don't care but we won't be going back."}
{"text":"9:40 on a Monday morning.  Veggie omelet was just OK, whole wheat toast was that Wonder brown stuff, and the home fries were fried on a grill or in oil that was old or rancid.  I didn't have any bacon, so I can't comment, but Daniel F. seems to know his bacon, so I'd take his word.  Coffee was decent diner fare."}
{"text":"Aris makes the best Club House sandwiches I have ever had. The few times I didn't get the Club House, whatever I order was very good as well. The staff is always super friendly and the atmosphere is very welcoming."}
{"text":"- 80s decor diner with your standard breakfast, BLTs, and souvlaki dinners available. - it's easy to mess up classic diner food - and ari's keeps it classy :) - nothing that special about it, but if you're looking for a greasy spoon type breakfast for 5 to 7 dollars... ari's is your joint."}
{"text":"I used to come to this place often, but the last few times have been atrocious. Ordered breakfast the last two times, got sick. The lunch food was mealy and bland. It's like the cooks got lazy or something - they clearly don't care, spend more time chatting with the regulars at the bar. Ambiance is frankly sad - bunch of old guys yelling at the TV. Go anywhere else."}
{"text":"Decent breakfast food for cheap. Our waitress was very slow and inattentive. We constantly had to ask for coffee refills or for dirty plates to be taken out of the way. The workers seem to get very stressed out when it's busy. Other than that it's a pretty friendly atmosphere and the food is good."}
{"text":"Awesome beyond belief!! I love this place soooo much!!  The staff is always friendly, accommodating and ready for a laugh.  Everything on the menu is delicious. My favorites are the double pork chop dinner, oh so charred and tasty. Then the Chicken Souvlaki Dinner with its charred goodness along with a side of fries (extra tzatziki for them) and a greek salad w/ feta to DIE for....  Oh my Aris dreams you do me well, when I am not in Toronto to enjoy your delicious fare.  Thanks Guys!!!"}
{"text":"Been here a bunch of times.  Breakfast is good, not too expensive compared to other places in the area.  Sometimes it's really great and sometimes when it's too busy people seem a bit stressed out.  Nice cozy atmosphere and lots of choices on the menu which is nice.  Definitely one of the 3 best places on Roncesvalles for cheap-ish breakfast."}
{"text":"What do you expect from this place?  I'll tell you what I expect : a greasy, satisfying breakfast and a cheap ass greek salad subbed in on the side for a bit extra.  Guess what? This place always delivers. We eat breakfast here every couple of months and it's the one place we can both agree on all the time when the thought comes up.  Been coming here for nearly a decade and haven't been disappointed in the outcome yet. You're not gonna get a great 'healthy' meal here, nor should you expect it going in. Enjoy it for what it is."}
{"text":"An absolute Roncesvalles classic! I used to frequent it for breakfast all the time when I lived in the neighbourhood. Nothing miraculous and nothing pretentious--just a reliable diner that pumps out the classic dishes and does them right!"}
{"text":"We had breakfast here,  all in all I'd say \"not bad.\" Service was fast and friendly,  prices are reasonable. My wife had the Western sandwich and I had waffles with strawberry on top and a side of sausages; we both thought our food was okay. The strawberry topping tasted like it was from a can,  the sausages were decent."}
{"text":"I live just around the corner, and eat here fairly often. Discovered the place while on a visit here prior to moving to the area, and remembered it well before coming here. The prices are right, and the breakfast is awesome!   The servers are always in a good mood and talkative. The food always comes very quickly, and I'm always pleasantly surprised at how low the bill is, especially compared to some other joints in the area. Roncesvalles can be really expensive, but this comfortable little restaurant seems to push back against the hipster idealism of the area, leading to a cozy atmosphere and delicious food!  Definitely stop by if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"The poutine is really the sole reason I return here time and time again. I love Ari's poutine!! Its creamy and salty and delicious."}
{"text":"Aris never tries to hide what it is. It's a classic diner style restaurant that has everything on the menu. The staff are extremely friendly and are always happy to have a chat. The food is exactly what you would expect. It's tasty, fresh and extremely cheap.   I am a huge regular for dinner and also a breakfast after a big night. They constantly keep the coffee coming, the portions are huge and the beer is cheap! What more do you need!   Aris is a Roncesvalles institution. If you haven't been, you're not a local!"}
{"text":"Typical open kitchen greasy spoon.  The food isn't mind blowing and it isn't bad.  Everything exactly what you would expect from the place: 30 year decor, line cooks, and average food.  Except for the bathrooms which have been freshly renovated and are immaculate."}
{"text":"Probably the best cheap eats place on Roncesvalles, where you can actually go in sit and eat with someone else for under $20. Burgers are good, not great. Fries and onion rings usually tasty.  Large high definition television in the back, and a couple smaller televisions scattered around. Looks like it could be a good place to come with a group looking to eat cheap as well.   Service is friendly, and it's a very homey feeling. Deserving of a four star rating for being good, friendly and one of the few places to actually eat for really cheap on Roncesvalles. No gourmet burgers, and no gourmet prices. Simple."}
{"text":"Aris Place is good for an average, greasy spoon breakfast. The prices are average, as is the service. Note a few things...   1. Coffee is \"included\" in many meals, but refills of coffee are not. If you refill coffee, you pay for it. This is a strange bit of pricing strategy. 2. The home fries and the peameal bacon are very good. The French Toast, made from plain white bread, is usually short of eggs. 3. Pay at the counter after the meal. Usually your ticket is at the cash. They do not take American Express."}
{"text":"If you want a kick-ass cheeseburger and don't mind traveling to this part in the city, then this is it. Freshly grilled (aren't they all), thick juicy flavourfull patty cooked perfectly (not as easy as it sounds), fresh bun (trust me, many places mess this up too), served with excellent service, tucked on a busy and cozy street with various types of cafes and restaurants. Can't wait to go there again."}
{"text":"I've been here twice. The first time was quite a while ago and I don't remember what I ordered so I can't be much help on the taste diversity of the menu. But this afternoon I ordered a veggie burger and french fries and I was very disappointed.   The french fries are your standard, run of the mill, frozen-flash fried thick potato rectangles.. No seasoning, no greasiness, just dry. As for the burger.. I know a lot of you are thinking \"of course it tasted like cardboard, it's a veggie burger\" but I'd like to believe that as vegetarianism isn't an unusual choice by 2016 that restaurants would put a little more effort into the meatless food they are offering. It was very dry and very flavourless and left my tummy a little queasy.  I didn't finish the burger, which is something I NEVER do, and the waitress sort of scolded me, as if I was her 7 year old daughter refusing to eat her vegetables. The service was fast though i'll give them that.   I'm kind of surprised by the amount of positive reviews to be honest. Looking around the restaurant I didn't see a dish that looked particularly favouring. I get the impression though that Aris is home to mostly locals that have gone here for years. I hope those loyal customers step out of their comfort zones and see what else Parkdale has to offer for food.   I would have rather had a burger from Mcdonalds. Sorry Aris."}
{"text":"Love having brunch in this place. Friendly, simple, no pretenders, it is a neighbourhood eatery and I hope It stays Like this forever."}
{"text":"There's just something about this place... it's comfort food in a comfortable place and I've never had to wait for a table... unlike the Ace next door.  My buddy and I go once a week, he usually gets the burger and fries, I usually go for the Pork Souvlaki special which includes soup and a tea or coffee.  Prices are nice and affordable.  Staff are always friendly.    Taking off a star as for a place that has an all day breakfast, that seems to be the one thing that could be better, at least for me.  Tried the breakfast twice but didn't like it either time."}
{"text":"If your looking for a good classic dinner, this is the place! Always have quick service, good food and cheap prices. Cannot go wrong!"}
{"text":"Gord and I had brunch today at Aris Place.  We were driving around looking for a place to eat and it caught our eye.  Gord ordered a Corned Beef and Cheese Omelette (it came with toast).  He said it was delicious and he'd get it again.  There was a lotta meat!  I ordered the Chicken Souvlaki Dinner with home fries rather than French fries.  It was supposed to come with a Greek Salad but I passed on it since I'm not a fan.  It came with garlic bread.  The chicken was delicious ... it had a nice spice to it and was juicy and tender.  The tzatziki was tasty.  I was surprised that rice wasn't an option as a side ... that would have made this meal even better ... it seemed odd to have French fries or home fries with it.  I'd get it again.  We'll be back!  Our server was friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"The place is reminiscent of a road dinner along some stretch of town line road.  Yet, I find myself making a trek down here at least once a week for my fill of comfort food.  Interesting collection of people, competent and friendly staff, reasonable prices and simple, consistent food is what you can expect from this local greasy-spoon.  The souvlaki on a bun and homemade banquet burger are my top picks and you get excellent value with the breakfast choices.    Bonus marks for always being warm, having the daily paper and being able to get up and pay instead of flagging down a waitress for the bill."}
{"text":"Always confuse this with the other Ari's Place a little further up the street. One of them won't serve you a beer because they don't have a liquor license so be careful. Good banquet burgers only $4 and the coffee's waterier as heck."}
{"text":"First time in the area and Yelp pointed us to this place for a quick breakfast, among others in the area. What was the deciding factor? Simple, the affordable price! Plus with 4 kids it needed to be cheap but with substance. As soon we walked in we were greeted with a smile from the gentleman behind the counter. The food was mediocre but the service was fast and the waitress Carla was attentive and witty. Will there be a repeat performance? I won't go out of my way cause it's far from me, but if I'm in the area, definitely. If not for the food but the fast service and friendly atmosphere."}
{"text":"Since Mitzi's turned into \"The Sister\" - this might be my new destination for greasy brunch fare.  The prices are beyond reasonable, it is chock full of comforting straight-up, nothing fancy food.  It is so lovely to just be able to walk up & pay your tab when you're done with your toast, paper & coffee.  Straight-up diner with friendly service."}
{"text":"service is great here. the waitresses are very friendly and attentive. it has a really family home feeling to it, not a fan of the carpet on the ground but it's not a deal breaker. the food is so cheap, and it's great quality. it is a lot more lit and bright inside than it looks from outside. i walked by this place everyday for months and never ventured inside. one day i did, and it did not disappoint."}
{"text":"Excellent food, good prices, great service, and pleasant atmosphere. The place hasn't changed over the years, still the best diner in town."}
