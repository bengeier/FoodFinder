{"text":"This is a fantastic bar/restaurant on the Quay in westport.  It has a prime location with beautiful views over the hills and out to the lough.   We was staying at the coast hotel across from the bar so thought we would give it a go.  The front bar has a small, local feel to it. This then opens in to the restaurant which is bright and spacious. There is a huge beer garden out the back and a park for kids to play in.  A must stop for an early evening pint"}
{"text":"Lovely tasty food, good portions. Staff seemed very nice and the manager very friendly and helpful. Food area was packed even on a Monday night.  The chowder was great."}
{"text":"I loved this place but service can be spotty. Inconsistent. Right on the bay with a spacious bar, dining room and outdoor patio. And very friendly service. Also kid friendly. Some of the very best oysters I have ever had - really.  But depending on the night they can be average. Not sure if their source is consistent.  The mussels and \"catch of the day\" were also quite good. And the prices were fair. I would return."}
{"text":"This place looks the part, from the inside and the outside...really,it's like every pub you remember from your childhood sipping a glass bottle of coke and eating Tayto cheese and onion... but cleaner!  Being right on the coast I guess it's no surprise that they do seafood but it is good - and that's not something you can always say. The seafood chowder at 6.90Eur is well worth a shot and for those of you who don't like all things fishy try 'the Islander' a chicken wrap with spicy bits for 12.50, terrific! Of course no pub review is complete without the obligatory comment on the quality of the pint..I was driving, so all I can tell you is they do a mean diet coke!  There is a restaurant attached to the towers, sadly we didn't get to try it but locals tell me it is not at all bad.  As to the name of the place I could only count one tower, I asked the bar man about this, he looked at me as if I had ten heads and served a more deserving punter. Quite right too."}
