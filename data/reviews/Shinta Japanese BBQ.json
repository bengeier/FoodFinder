{"text":"Place was busy but good thing we made a reservation ahead of time. Ordering was easy and quick and our server was amazing.  Meat - We liked lamb and beef tongue a lot. Other meats were fresh too.  Seafood - Shrimp were fresh. We liked both garlic and melted cheese shrimp.  Vegetable - They were fresh. We liked sweet potato and sweet corn.  Appetizer and side dish - Lots of choices to choose from. Takoyaki and cold noodles were amazing.  Overall the service and food were one of the best for Japanese barbecue in Toronto. We will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Since its grand opening, I've heard mixed reviews from this place regarding the service.  However, I can say that my experience here was contrary to what I heard, I would recommend anyone to come experience it for themselves.  Located in a plaza with plenty of parking. I wore some clothes that I didn't  care much thinking that I would smell like meat after. However, the wonderful ventilation didn't make me rush home to shower.  Compared to other bbq places I have been to, this is a wonderful experience with comfortable seating, exceptional ventilation and adequate safety measures in place.    Food: Quality of the food is exceptional and is worth it's price point. I tried almost everything on the menu including the japanese A5, M6+ Australian and US Wagyu.  That platter is worth ordering, the japanese A5 texture melts in your mouth.  The Australian M6+ is different in that its more meaty but still very good.  I ate it plain without any seasoning or sauce needed to fully appreciate the quality of the meat.    In terms of the all you can eat menu, I liked that it had a huge variety and although its selection specializes in meats, their other dishes like salmon, clams, side dishes were equally good.  The salmon was surprisingly good for an all you can eat bbq place.  For the meats, I liked that most of their meats were not drenched in sauce because it proves that their quality is excellent cut.  The only items i thought needed improvement was the bibimbap and soba.  Even if you just order the regular angus beef AYCE is worth it because that quality of angus beef was comparable to the US Wagyu.  It was very similar that if I tried it without being told which was which, i might mix it up.  However, if you want to try the Wagyu, its reasonable too for the meat cut and quality that you are getting.    They have a wide selection to order with your meal.  Lots of options, I ordered the superfruit tea which was very refreshing and sweet.  It paired well with all the meats.  The strawberry yakult was good too but i found that halfway through the drink, it might fill you up preventing you from eating more.    Service: Rebecca was our server and she was great.  She explained all the dishes that were brought to our table and came regularly to change plates/bbq plate.  The drinks came promptly and when there was a delay with 1 of them, she came to update us that it was not forgotten."}
{"text":"The food here was great! The meat here is very fresh and the marinate is amazing. Only thing was the lack of service when I went, especially since it was really dead during the time I went. Other than that, great place to satisfy your kbbq cravings!"}
{"text":"I came to this restaurant at 5:30 and was told I'd get a seat by 7:00 for a party of two. Being incredibly excited about the concept of this new restaurant, I endured the wait hoping to be seated by 7:00. Ahead of me were 5 other parties and I began getting concerned as none of the walk in customers were seated. 7:15 came around and I asked the hostess what the status was for our seating. With snarl and arrogance she responded saying,   \"Let me see, there are 1 2 3 4 5 (she counted out out in an incredibly condescending manner) people ahead of you and our restaurant is at capacity. We of course give priority to our customers with reservations. We have customers with reservations for 6:00 still waiting\"    I kindly thanked her and I left the restaurant with my party. An establishment that is this unorganized and unprofessional does not deserve my business.   I wasted 2 hours in the waiting area due to the incompetence of the restaurant management. Had they told me the restaurant was at capacity for the night when I came in, I would have been fine to walk out and choose another establishment. I felt sorry for the other parties who came in without reservations who still waited as I left. It was unlikely that they had any dinner that night.  Upon writing my review for Shinta, I read the other comments left for this restaurant and it doesn't seem like the food was that good either. Very disappointing to say the least.   All in all, be weary if you decide to spend your evening here. Make reservations and still anticipate a wait for disappointing food."}
{"text":"This place has really nice quality meats and the price is not expensive for what you are given. We went on a Monday night and it was busy even at 8:30pm. Reservations is highly recommended. After looking at the menu and price point, it seemed like the regular menu was a better deal. And if you really wanted to try wagyu it's better off to order as an add-on, which we did. We ordered the Japanese A5 wagyu ($65/200g) and omg it was delicious! it literally melts in your mouth. We got a pitcher of watermelon juice for $9, not a bad price. The only thing I was disappointed about was the lack of sauces they give you. There was only one sauce available and it was the basic Korean bbq sauce you would find anywhere. I prefer gyubee sauces a lot more. Other than that, I am quite content with this place, would recommend going."}
{"text":"They told us the wait was going to be 1 hour so we decided to wait. After an hour they told us there were still 5 tables ahead of us and could not give us a wait time. If it was going to be longer than an hour wait they should have told us that to begin with instead of wasting our time.  This is unacceptable."}
{"text":"Came here April 14 2018 in the middle of a spring snow and ice storm aroumd 6:00 pm. Was surprised to find out there were also people waiting in line and was told about an hour wait time. Since it was really bad outside hey dont mind at all. Approx about 45 mins we were seated promptly. There was only the two of us and we were lead to another room and was surprised to see half empty tables. We left approx 8:15 and the tables were still half empty.   We started off with their main dish course which is the Wagyu, there are two choices American and Austrailian. I prefer the Austrailian because of its marblization. Servings are pretty decent except for the side dishes which i find too small just one table spoon full.   Meat quality is excellent especially the lamb chops, Wagyu beefs are good and tasty however they are seasoned. I they just left it as it and just seasoned it with salt and pepper and no free house tea thats why i only gave 3 stars.   Overall food quality on the menu are good, didnt try the regular beef because we paid for premium beef. Will go back again but will try their regular food in the menu."}
{"text":"Pictures of Shinta kept popping up on IG, so on a whim, my friend and I decided to try our luck on a Wednesday night. We were told wait time is about 1 hr but was lucky enough to get a table in 15 mins (many people ahead of us likely gave up waiting).  We ordered the wagyu ayce (69.99 - weekday price). The US wagyu had more marbling than the Australian cut. Since we paid for the wagyu ayce, we simply kept ordering plate after plate alternating between the 2 choices.  There are many meat and vegetables options. We managed to try a few - pork Toro (neck), pork belly, chicken knuckles, beef tongue, mushroom, corn and okra. The clams in sake were a delight.  The service was slow to start due to a packed restaurant, but our server (the one who take orders) was friendly and polite.  The reason I rated Shinta 3 stars is because overall the food was average. The wagyu ayce is something I'd only try once (mainly coz it's new). And for regular ayce, I'd prefer a good old Korean BBQ restaurant over at yonge and finch."}
{"text":"This review is just based on their customer service and not related with food as I can't even try their restaurant. I tried to make reservation for 2 at like 8:30pm which is consider late. I tried calling since 11am till like all the way to 7pm but most of the time it's either no pick up or directly to automated message except the last call i made which is 7pm and finally someone picked up but told me they already fully booked and even walk-in we should start at 5pm so they will put you into their 8 or 8:30 spots. I was very not impressed so far because no one is picking up calls and if you need to make reservation then we should go directly to the restaurant and book it. Anyways, I will see if I can get to try this place next time and hopefully I will be able to adjust this review for better."}
{"text":"Food: Great variety of AYCE meat. IMO, Wagyu was delicious but wasn't worth it. The grand opening promo was one free plate per table and each person at our table only received four pieces each. (Was a group of six). For dessert, mango slush, vanilla ice cream and yuzu were on the menu, however, these were limited and they ran out of dessert so that was disappointing.  Atmosphere: Decent. There needs to be more grills at the table. Six people were sharing one grill so longer cooking time which didn't help with the two hour seating limit implemented. There was another area that was closed off. I think they should hire more staff so they could've opened up that section to let in more people who waited in line for hours in strong wind and rain.  Service: Mediocre and needs improvement. It was difficult to flag down a server and service was slow. Our server Edison tried his best. Receiving our food was slow and the menu should state how many items are on each order. We ordered six pieces of takoyaki but six plates came instead and this was after we sitting there for 15 minutes to pay.  The marketing manager had gone around to tables for feedback and we expressed our feedback to her."}
{"text":"I was skeptical before coming here because I read the reviews. I was pleasantly surprised that my experience at this restaurant was great. My husband and I were seated immediately upon arrival and our order was taken promptly. We ordered the Angus ayce and the meats that came were very good quality. The food was great and the service was amazing. We will definitely come back here."}
{"text":"This is my first time here at Shinta and I brought my family here for a birthday dinner. Overall there were ups and downs but in the end we left with a positive mood.  Food: we got the 31.99 without the wagyu beef. Excellent quality food and lots of choices. Even my grandma ate a lot and that's saying something because she usually doesn't eat that much food at home.   Service: from a lot of reviews before me, it seems like service was where this place falls short. We came here at 8pm and was seated promptly. We were greeted by our server who took our orders right away. After awhile, we ate two rounds of veggies and we began to ask our server where the meat was and she assured us she placed the orders in. We waited awhile until 8:45pm and noticed the tables around us receiving their orders of meat before we did but they arrived later than we did. We had to flag down another server, her name is Cherry, and she followed up with our orders right away and kept apologizing to us and made sure our orders come right away. And soon enough our table was filled with dishes and she kept coming by asking how everything was and was very attentive to our table. This really made us feel great. I think management should have the others here learn from her customer service skills which can definitely up the service level of this establishment.   Overall, will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"We made a reservation for 7pm for 2 and was given a table soon after entering the restaurant. We came at a pretty hectic hour so it was understandable that all servers were pretty busy. Our server checked up on us a few times to make sure that we were doing good and regularly asked if we needed to add more. The cocktails are a must try! They compliment the meat well without being overpowering.  I recommend coming here and do book reservations in advance!"}
{"text":"If you're looking to splurge, this place might be worth splurging on if you want to try AYCE* wagyu.  If you don't want to risk a disappointing night, really consider making some reservations cause it gets really packed. It was a wednesday night, and it was just a full-house. Reservations probably doesn't mean guaranteed a table at that exact time, but better than getting on a waiting list of hours. When we arrived, our table was still being set up, so we waited at the lobby. During those 5 minutes or so, I saw 5 separate groups of people walking in and then leaving when they were told they had to wait at least an hour or two. There's a dining limit of 2 hours, but even then, combined with reservations and walk-in's, you should book in advance.  Interior is clean and spacious. Plenty of space to walk around. High-chairs available for infants. Accessible washrooms, with baby-changing stations available. Points given for accessibility and family-friendly. There isn't a particularly strong smell that I usually notice in other BBQ places, which suggests the ventilation is pretty good. And indeed, my clothes did not smell like BBQ afterwards.  Orders are placed with wait-staff, so you really need to be ready with a list of items in mind once you can flag your waiter down because there are only a couple managing the entire floor. It's AYCE; everyone seems to require service all the time. Due to the lack of waiters, service takes a hit, and so sometimes things might not come. If it's taking too long it is time to speak up and ask to check on an order. Grill changes are offered throughout the meal, on top of everything going on. Servers have small pieces of paper near each dish, presumably so they know which dish goes to which table. Not a bad set up.  They've got an AYCE food menu, and then a separate drink menu with a selection of alcoholic and non-alcoholic. Not sure if there is a non-AYCE option available where you just want to have a couple drinks with some wagyu cuts, but call to check. The lunch menu is also significantly different from the dinner menu, with almost only a quarter of the selection available. Something to take into consideration.  For dinner, there is a regular AYCE option, where you can order some wagyu cuts on the side for extra $. They've got australian, US, and japanese cuts on the menu. If you think you're going to be ordering a lot of wagyu, you can do the wagyu AYCE option for an extra ~$40, which entitles you to unlimited amounts of australian and US beef. *However, the japanese beef is still an extra order on the side. But if you're looking to give it a try before heading to japan or something, come with a group, get an order, and split that cost.  Opting for the AYCE wagyu, we ignored most of the other options; the rest of the menu can wait when we're trying a regular AYCE. It was just order after order of the australian and US cuts, though some other meats and veggies did get thrown in there for variety's sake otherwise the only pics you'll see are plates upon plates of the same thing. The slices were not TOO thin, and very little marinade (though they do like their sesame seeds...please inform of allergies). Meat cooks fast, fats drip all over, don't leave it on too long, watch your hands cause the flames go pretty high. Tuck your sleeves in, tie your hair back.  Then the japanese A5 was served up. And the marbling was quite a sight. No marinade, no sesame, just straight up raw marbled beef. I was pretty satisfied with the australian and US wagyu, but the melt-in-your-mouth texture and taste was certainly a different type of experience. And then of course more dishes of the other wagyu.  For dessert, you only get a choice between a honeydew melona bar, or a mango melona bar. Pretty anti-climactic.  It was definitely cheat-night full of meat. They don't have too many vegetable options for those that want a balanced meal, but if you're going the extra mile for that ayce wagyu, those veggies can take the backseat.  The service can get pretty chaotic due to lack of wait-staff compared to the number of tables. I think if you stick to a very specific set of options and not crawling through the entire menu, you might have a better time cause it's harder to mess up when all you're getting is wagyu.  If they can figure out a way to not have to turn down too many walk-ins and improve overall service on a busy night, I think it would be pretty solid."}
{"text":"To be completely honest, most of the reviews here are pretty harsh. In comparison to Korean BBQ, the quality of meet that is provided at Shinta Japanese BBQ is amazing. To start off, there are 2 menus, I had the WAYGU ACE($71.99). I've never had Waygu before and have always wanted to try it without travelling all the way to Japan, it was really good for a first experience. My only recommendation to add value, would be to provide a separate salt and pepper shaker - I asked for one and the waiter pointed out some red spice mix which honestly tasted and smelt like taco bell seasoning (still good). All in all, I had a good experience - management was kind, waiters were great and responsive, and the meat quality was premium. Well worth the price and would definitely recommend everyone trying it out at-least once!"}
{"text":"I had heard some unfavourable reviews from someone close to me, so my expectations were quite low. I was pleasantly surprised.   The cooking style is similar to Korean BBQ, except that instead of a cast iron grill, this is a wire mesh over a very hot flame. Things cook FAST. We got to try a variety of wagyu. I honestly wasn't a huge fan. I found the flavour kind of weak, and it was really fatty and buttery. It's just not how I like my beef to be. I REALLY enjoyed their angus beef. It had a deep flavour and good texture.  I was particularly impressed by their non-beef options. They had a wide variety of other meats and veggies. I particularly liked the octopus balls (soft and so SO delicious), the kimchi soup (a mix of kimchi and HK style borscht), and the veggies that were all drowned in garlic butter. Give the chicken and lamb a pass. The chicken was overwhelmingly spiced, and the lamb was a pretty bone-in lamb chunk. Too big and unwieldy to share.  The drink list was also the most varied I've seen in an Asian place. They had wine, beer, specialty cocktails, and a many good non-alcoholic options. We had some fruit drinks at the table that were SUPER tasty (they came from Dagu across the street, which is owned by the same company) and also sparkling water, which is kind of a big deal to me because I love it and I never see it in Asian restaurants. Plus I needed that acidity to cut through all the meat grease!  The restaurant has only been open a couple of months, and some of the service needs work. Our main server was absolutely delightful, and easily answered all our questions and was happy to explain all the dishes as they came. Some of the people running the food seemed new and kind of shy, so I couldn't hear their descriptions over the din of the restaurant (which is LOUD). That being said, they seem to be making a concerted effort to improve, as the general manager came by often and was very thoughtful about our feedback. I even saw her patiently walking someone through the hosting duties when I arrived.  All in all, I would definitely return with friends, though we might just order the wagyu a la carte. It's something you definitely want to try once, but not get all that you can eat of."}
{"text":"Went to this place because it was an AYCE Wagyu beef Japanese bbq. We were excited to try this place. We were somewhat disappointed with the experience.   Made a reservation a week well in advance. The are all booked for the week and we were lucky to get this space. Our reservation was at 8:00, but we didn't get in until 8:35. We were very angry at that point. Whats the point of a reservation system if you have to wait an extra 30 minutes?   When we sat down, we notice A LOT of empty tables. Man, they could have had more customers inside instead of letting them wait outside. On top of that, I assume the reason why we were bumped is because some friends showed up and we were bumped to a later table....Not happy at all.   Looking at the service, our server was fantastic. Very friendly.....but VERY VERY busy. The attitude was great, but the actual service could have improve. I think that they were understaffed. People were calling the staff left right and center.   Saying that, the actual food wasn't too bad. The quality of the meat was pretty good. You should get the American wagyu beef. It is finely marbled....the Australian wagyu beef wasn't marbled, and there was a thick layer on one side. It seems like it was just regular beef.   The price point of this place is very expensive. As it is an AYCE wagyu beef bbq, you would logically go there for the wagyu bbq. The problem is that it is extremely price. At $70 an adult, you had better go hungry.  if you only eat Australian beef, you are wasting your money. It tastes like any other bbq place.   Overall, i wouldn't go back again....it just isn't worth the price."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place but based on the service I don't really think I would return too often. Arriving later in the evening there was less than a 5 minute wait for table, knowing that last call is at 10PM we quickly skimmed the menu for our initial order and as we were eating we made another order before 10PM.  US Wagyu - Melts in your mouth; repeat as often as possible.   Australian Wagyu - Wasn't as good as the US but still a great cut of meat.    Everything else was pretty basic, for the regular AYCE you do get more choices than competitors but nothing really stuck out, what was really disappointing was the lamb and salmon, did not enjoy those two what so ever but it's a nice touch to have lamb on the menu I suppose. It was tough and kinda just tasted like rosemary or whatever marinade they used lol. I feel like there's more value in the regular AYCE as you can add-on the wagyu separately.   Service is where they lost most of their stars given that they promote being a high end restaurant (serving wagyu and whatnot) they really need to train their staff to give a shit. I was trying to make my first order and my server did not understand 1/3 of what I was saying unless I was pointing directly at the item, not only that but she was giving us quite the attitude as if I was bothering her, luckily she wasn't our dedicated server or I would've killed myself with how frustrating it was trying to put in a simple order. My water was never refilled and they even took my cup away for some reason LOL.   ONE KEY THING I NOTICED was they don't bring exactly amounts of what you ordered especially with the wagyu if you order more than 10. First order I put in 10, 10 came and then the next order was 20, 16 came (I counted lol) for last call I attempted to order 40 pieces of the US wagyu and 6 (LOL?) pieces of the AUSTRALIAN wagyu came. Oh and on top of that they strategically bring out the wagyu long after everything else so you fill yourself up with the regular AYCE items.   With such a high price-tag per person I find it strange that they do not accept credit.. very surprisingly luckily I brought cash. They also automatically charge 12% so don't worry about tipping unless you felt like they deserve more.   For $70 before tax and tip per person and the potential of a 1-2 hour wait I would second guess when my next visit would be, I'm not saying I'll never return but for the money there's places that would treat me better."}
{"text":"Excellent food, wow an all you can eat wagyu?!!! Yes pleaseee! Being a personal chef and cooking a lot of steaks, you can tell that their quality meat is on point.   Japanese A5 Wagyu was my personal favourite, it it's pricey but it's worth every dollar. (You pay what you get for)"}
{"text":"They only take reservation for 5:30pm and 8:30pm, which is not convenient for us at all.  We did manage to get a table at 9pm by walk in on a weekday.  Food is decent, service is good but not great for English speaking folks.  Meat quality is pretty good and I like how they didn't over marinate it. Compared to Gyubee, I can actually taste the meat instead of the marinate.  Ventilation is fine, certain has some BBQ smell but acceptable."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed our dinner here! The food was amazing! It's exactly everything that you would expect coming from the advertisements. The beef literally melted in your mouth the seafood tasted really fresh. The atmosphere is really nice really enjoy the decoration and the layout of the restaurant. Lot of bench seats however if you request child seat very limited. They added a nice touch they serve you lemon water instead of regular tap water. The only reason I'm giving a four-star was because the service is very slow and we were served after clients who came in after us were served. It was until I spoke out to somebody that someone finally came to service. But all in all we will come back more like for a treat rather than a regular dinner."}
{"text":"the quality of the foods is wonderful. We chosen the regular angus beef and ordered the Japanese wagyu for extra. I love the marinated short rib and the prime Kalbi short rib, they are really good quality and I will definitely recommend the Japanese A5 wagyu, like what others said, the wagyu melted in my mouth, I love that feeling! The price is ok, and the service is good, our server came and check if we were doing ok, they are charged 12% tips show the bill , save my time, calculate the tips is always difficult for me, all and aWill be back soon!!"}
{"text":"Arrived at 8:00pm, at 8:51pm, the waitress gave us water. Thinking \"yay\" it will be warm water or warm tea. But it was cold water. Sitting near the waiting area for an hour is already cold enough.   The music at the waiting area is like clubbing music and not a good idea when you have 14 hungry pissed off customers at the waiting area at 9:20PM  The staff will remind you that there is no guarantee. I learned very early in my life that there is no guarantee in life. So that was okay. We were told by 9:30pm that everyone can get a seat. 9:24pm finally sat down. The music is way too loud for the dining room.  I find the meat nice, but some marinade a little too sweet. The Wagyu AYCE items are Australian sirloin steak, melts in your mouth. I think the sesame is not really necessary. But after awhile, it's not easy to tell whether is Australian or US. We ordered a drink each, the bill came to $198 with 12% service charge included. The sake clams (limited offer) were nice. Nice enough I was scooping up the cooked sake from my shell. The cooked food such as the takoyaki and chicken karaage tasted good. Overall, it was good experience. A little pricy, but worth a try!  (3.5 stars)"}
{"text":"Shinta is a relatively new AYCE JBBQ place that opened, and is quite busy! Make a reservation ahead of time, so you don't have to wait around. We were told there are 20 tables for walk-ins.   The food was fantastic, but the service wasn't so good. Many of our orders never came, and it was difficult to flag down servers because of how busy they all were. We were also told that it was last call for food orders at 10pm (when the place closes at 11), which really sucked, given that we never got several orders of our food. That being said, one of our servers, Rebecca, was really nice and attentive.   You have the option of regular AYCE or wagyu AYCE, where the wagyu AYCE is $30-40 more (can't remember off the top of my head) and lets you get unlimited Australian and US wagyu. The more expensive wagyu is a la carte only.   We opted for regular AYCE, and also ordered 200g each of Japanese and Australian wagyu on the side.  Both were delicious - the Japanese wagyu was very buttery and soft. The food on the regular AYCE menu was very good, and I definitely would stick to that if I come back.  All in all, I really liked the food, but I don't think I'll be back because of the service. It was too much work to have to constantly check on whether our orders were coming, ask for water refills, and we didn't get as much food as we wanted because of all this."}
{"text":"Came here for the opening where there was a promotion: free plate of US Wagyu, according to their Facebook post, and Insta posts by influencers. Arrived at 4pm and queue was already formed around the corner of the restaurant. Crowd was poorly managed  - they should have come out to give numbers to people in the queue because there was this group of millenials cutting queue just because they were \"friends\" with people ahead of us and then whining about how \"broke\" they were. More and more of their friends CUT queue . People behind us left. Believe they already provided their review below. I'm guessing not letting people in was intended to generate noise on social media, which is fine, but they should have managed the queue.   The promotion was not clearly communicated. When we got to the door it turned out, that if you go for the regular AYCE, you get a free plate of US wagyu. If you go for the Wagyu AYCE, you get a free plate of Japanese wagyu.   It was also confusing that their website shows a AYCE menu and a platter menu, but the hostess told us there was only AYCE menu.   Food was great  . Loved the selection and there is a reason why Japanese wagyu costs so much. It was creamy, and tastes nothing like beef that I've had  ! The US wagyu was of decent quality too. All in all, high quality food and therefore the price tag compared to other bbq places.   For some reason one waitress told us there is a limit on the mango lychee slush. Another waiter delivered more slush when we asked. So perhaps someone needs more training.   Would love to come back to try the platter menu if it exists.  I'm adding to my bucket list - eating wagyu in Japan!"}
{"text":"I don't usually write reviews but I felt compelled to write one after what I have experienced here tonight. I am writing the review as I am waiting for the food ( seems like the whole night was waiting as a lot of our orders were missed and took forever ). I risked EVERYTHING by choosing to make a reservation here for my birthday with friends , because of the negative reviews. I have tried gyubee before , but I wanted to try Shinta due to the wagyu .  Food : went with the angus ayce . quality of meat was good , but it wasn't marinated that well. It's salty and the variety was ok. We ordered a la carte wagyu to try , as they are really fatty and I didn't think we would be able to eat that much. The wagyu quality was good (a5 Japanese is the best one) but the ayce wagyu probably would be too much .   Ambience : a bit more upscale than gyubee , and it was very airy and bright with natural lighting .   Service : one of the worst services I have had , even for Ayce standards . Took a lot of effort trying to wave down our waiter , and even when we did get to order, a lot of stuff was missed. We waited a long time for food and didn't get a lot of orders in. We also asked for water like 5 times but our waiter never got it for us. Gyubee had way better service and they would occasionally check on you. One of the waiters also gave attitude when our friend asked for something. He said NO , and that he only takes away plates, not take orders. At least tell us he can get someone else or say it nicely ... the best service I got was when my friend poured me water at the end of night when the water finally came ."}
{"text":"Had to wait 4 hours to get a table today. Pretty disappointed about the service, our waiter was rude and only came to our table twice the entire night. He kept ignoring our need for service and refused to serve dessert even when we were under the 2 hour seating limit. The bill came with a mandatory 12% tip that our waiter did not deserve, but this tip was forced upon us anyways. Overall kind of disappointed, probably won't come again. Gyubee is the better option."}
{"text":"I was scared of going after the reviews but it was a pretty good experience! Went for my birthday dinner, 5 people. I did have a reservation and they sat us within 7 minutes, they were just getting our table ready and for our whole party to arrive because the 2 hour clock starts the second you sit down. Got a bit of a weird table, could've done better but whatever. Server didn't speak much English but understood enough. The meat was good but if you like the big pieces, go for the lamb. Did take time to get everything and sometimes we'd have to remind them, but the food is great. The only thing I hated was my drink, the plum juice. Do Not Get It. Very bad. But staff was fine, food was good."}
{"text":"We made reservations and yet we didn't get seated till 20-30 mins later...   Food was good but some food took forever to arrive and we had to request for it multiple times.  Removed all the beef from the plate and the bottom of the plate looked a little off.. it didn't look like meat fat or oil...   We were here for 3 hrs!!! Since some food took forever to cook and food was slow in coming.   They only have melona popsicles for dessert( mango, melon and coconut)  I would come back but the next time I'd hope they give us the requested amount of food so we don't have to constantly order the same thing over and over again"}
{"text":"If you love beef! This is the place to go. Line ups are a while. A bit unorganized with reservations. The restaurant opened at 4pm. We arrived there at 3:40pm, was seated around 5pm. A bit pricey for all you can eat Waygu as it was not Japanese Waygu, only American or Austrian. However must to order is the fruit tea! Really refreshing and was not too sweet. Great one time experience as it was overly price for the type of quality beef. Service was average."}
{"text":"3.5./5 Finally tired this Japanese BBQ for lunch the place is pretty clean table grills and interior is not bad and pretty comfortable ventilation is good mind you it was not full house.  The staff was very friendly and helpful  The food was okay I enjoyed the short rib and beef think slice, chicken was good and so was the shrimp.   Overall quality was good."}
{"text":"I couldn't wait to try this place - Shinta Japanese BBQ because they have Wagyu AYCE. I went with two friends for dinner on the day before their grant opening. We waited for not too long and the host guided us to be seated. This place is clean & bright with comfortable seat. The server came to us & explained of AYCE menu and we decided to pick $71.99/adult weekend price so we could try two wagyu items - Australia Sirloin Steak and US Brisket Short Rib. The meats came fast to our table and we put to grill right away... wow... both wagyu taste are so tender. I like US wagyu as more beef taste and my friend preferred Australia wagyu more butter feel so we repeated both because it was so great. As my friend never try Japanese wagyu so we inquired the lady manager there, she professionally told us what the Kagoshima Japanese A5 wagyu is and we made extra order for $90/300g. When the Japanese wagyu put on our table, we grilled less than a minute and put it into our mouths...speechless...yummy...unbelievable it was melted into our mouths...taste was so...so...so delicious and we love it so immediately repeated an order. Besides, their AYCE comes with other good food like-various appetizers, New Zealand lamb rack, chicken, pork belly, pork toro, organic post loin steak, beef tongues, Kaliningrad short ribs,clams in sake, shrimps, okra, garlic butter broccroli, zucchini, asparagus, enoki mushrooms, sweet coin with butter and so on. You must try baked sweet potato as it was so good. Just remind that some items are limited offer. Don't forget to get the dessert drinks and I like mango lychee slush. I appreciate that they are very quick to change the thin wire mesh so not much burnt bits from previous grilling. In addition, there's no smelling on your hair & clothes after grilling not like other places. Overall, the service is very good & friendly, foods are fresh and quality is excellent, environment is warm and price is very reasonable. I would say go and try; you will find out you get more than you pay-truly worth it. This is the best Japanese BBQ Wagyu AYCE place which I would highly recommend to all of my friends and my colleagues and you. Absolutely I must come back again. Suggest that make reservation weeks ahead."}
{"text":"I visited Shinta last week after work. It's a fairly large, clean and spacious restaurant. It was so busy!!! Best to make reservation to save some disappointment. Might be wise to make reservations a week in advance ( ask for a window seat !) Restaurant is slightly understaffed,  so service might be slow. Staffs are friendly and accommodating.   Prices are very reasonable for quality food. Prices start at $70/pp for wagyu dinner and can go as high as you want it to be. The more premium wagyu costs extra, and is calculated by every 200-300g. I highly recommend trying Japanese A5 wagyu. That was the highlight of my night!! For side dishes, I recommend trying clams in sake, mixed mushrooms with garlic butter & takoyaki.  Loved the extensive drink menu!!! Drinks were inexpensive, which is a good thing. It was hard choosing just one drink, so I got the Shinta Polar Bear, sake mojito and strawberry yakult. The Shinta Polar Bear was my favourite, and complemented the wagyu very much. Not much strawberry taste in the strawberry yakult though... Meal ended with a popsicle as a light dessert. Yummy!  My first wagyu experience was a success, but it won't be easy adjusting back to regular beef.....I will be back!!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the wagyu ayce connect. Love the rich flavor of American wagyu and the aroma flavor of Australia wagyu. I really love the ice team beer as well. Reservation is must."}
{"text":"Shinta is an AYCE BBQ that truly defines this new era of unique restaurants catering to the adventurous and what a lot of people call the YOLO generation.  Some of the reviews that I have read prior to trying out this place personally, made me believe this to be a overpriced way of paying for an AYCE BBQ, with a slight inclination towards better quality meat.  However, in my humble opinion, this is probably the best AYCE BBQ place you can go to within the Toronto area.    The first few reviews truly did not explain the fact about the food or environment and was heavily biased towards wait times, which I find harsh and unreasonable (To each their own) .  If you truly judge just based on quality of food, then this place can easily be top tier as well as still on the relative affordable end if done properly.  What I mean by this is, it seems like the normal BBQ without any of the Wagyu experience is around $34.99 (+/- a dollar) which I find very reasonable.  Most AYCE these days charge around the $25-$30 mark anyways, and to have better quality cuts, I find highly encouraging to charge the extra premium.    If you want to try the partial Wagyu experience, it does climb to double the original price to experience the unlimited Wagyu experience.  Now the AYCE Wagyu experience does have some limitations as to the types of cut as well as to where the meat originates from (particularly the US and Australia), but I do not see a problem as you have access to a higher tier meat for the extra premium they charged.  My friends and I decided, that since we were going for the fully experience of the Wagyu taste, we added orders in a \"a la carte\" style serving experience of their Japanese Wagyu in the amounts of 300 grams.  This pretty much gives you 3 plates of their top tier Wagyu beef at the cost of around $30 odd dollars per 100 grams of their japanese beef.    The Japanese Wagyu is a great addition for anyone wanting to experiment and taste the experience of top tier beef and is a definite must for anyone that has never tried.  Personally, I believe that the next time I come again (while i love this place, I think AYCE is generally a once in every couple of months experience), probably the normal AYCE and adding the Japanese Wagyu is the way to go as the AYCE Wagyu option is limited anyways and let's be real, if you have too much of the same Wagyu anyways, it would not be a true pleasure of an experience and would not be as much of an enjoyment as if you truly savor your meal through one bite at a time.  Definitely will come again ahead of some of the other AYCE places that are continuously popping up in the Markham area, however, for now I will just savor the experiences of enjoying Wagyu within the GTA."}
{"text":"After hearing alot about Shinta, I finally made my way here this week. Shinta's interior is clean and very spacious, great for large parties as well as pairs. They're decor is simple but modern, a restaurant very pleasant to be in. We were greeted and quickly taken to our table. For a Monday night, the entire place was filled by 6:30pm. For their AYCE Agnus beef menu at the price of $31.99 - it's very comparable to Gyubee. The cuts of meat were deliciously marinated, they offer a quite a variety of sides as well. The sides though, are often all vegetables grilled with butter, therefore at the end of the meal, you do feel a bit greasy. Shinta does offer a few korean inspired dishes - some I would say need to be improved on (kimchi soup + bimbimbap) but other than that, the other sides were well prepared. They offer a great assortment of drinks for additional costs. I tried their Lemon Green Tea and it was awesome.   We also opted to ordered a platter of Waygu beef flown in from Japan + Australia, and I must say, they are DELICIOUS! The meat was so tender and melted in my mouth. Overall, I will definitely be back bring friends and family."}
{"text":"TLDR:  -The stoves suck, only 1/4 of it will properly cook your food. The other 3/4 will slowly heat it up.  - there are only 2 cuts of meat for wagyu so figure out if thats worth the extra $40 -Your food will come sporadically in random amounts.  -Being able to speak Mandarin is pretty useful here -has good variety of meats,veggies and appetizers -drinks are actually worth it    I, like most others bought into the hype of Shinta but let me break it down. Theres only 2 types of wagyu available for the ayce option, both are great cuts of meat. HOWEVER, the grills really suck. They don't distribute even heat to the point where it took about 10 mins to cook shrimp. Coming here is the equivalent of buying a nice steak and cooking it in the microwave. If i was to come here again, unless i'm trying to eat my weight in just wagyu i'd just choose the other option.   The service here was...good and bad. Starting with the cons, the servers kept bringing us food in random amounts. For ex. If we ordered two plates of short rib, one would come immediately and the other took 25 mins. If you have more than 4 people, you're going to have to figure who gets to eat which slice of meat. At one point they kept bringing us food that we didn't ever order and we tried telling them to stop but they only spoke mandarin. The girl taking our order was beyond nice and really helpful.   The drinks here were also pretty good. For $5 you're getting like a large bubble tea sized drink.   At the end of the day, i would only come here if my friends wanted ayce bbq. Definitely better than chakos or korean grill house."}
{"text":"4.5 stars! I've been keeping my eye out for this restaurant ever since I heard about it on BlogTO... and I thought it would be a good time to compare this restaurant since I've been to Gyubee a few times now so I have an idea what to expect for a japanese BBQ AYCE restaurant.  Firstly, for a Monday night, the restaurant was relatively busy. However, with that said, the restaurant space is huge. There were a lot of seating throughout the restaurant, and I liked that they have some chairs for those who are just walk-ins and maybe had to wait for a table. I find the seating is very comfortable and i'm not cramped for space, compared to other japanese BBQ restaurants. What really impressed me was the air circulation - normally when i go to AYCE BBQ restaurants, i always walk out smelling like grease and smoke. I find their stoves absorb the smoke really well, and for once, i actually feel air circulation.. like an actual draft, which i really like! I was able to walk out of the restaurant and not have to hop into the shower because I feel like i smell gross.  I had the opportunity to try everything.. and by everything i mean all the items offered on their AYCE menu except for glass noodles (one of the sides which were not available last night). Naturally, most of us come here for the meat, so I have the opportunity to try their special orders as well. At Shinta, you have two options: regular angus beef AYCE for 32.99 on a weekday... or wagyu beef AYCE for 69.99. Yes it is a much steeper price point, but for those who have actually tried to buy wagyu beef at butcher shops.. you know what you're paying for. So despite the almost double $$ hike, I felt for AYCE Wagyu, it's pretty reasonable. By that i would almost exclusively only order wagyu beef to eat to make it your money's worth.  First off, I tried the extra order of Japanese A5, Australian M6+ and US wagyu beef. I was quite impressed with the quality, particularly with the Japanese A5. The marbling is exquisite, very even, and 15 seconds on each side on the grill, plus their sweet soy sauce they suggest you pair with all your beef... it was amazing. The beef LITERALLY melts in your mouth - the quality is incredible. I def think this was my favourite, but you can't really scarf these down too much coz they are quite filling!  The Australian M6+ is obviously not as marbled as the A5, but it was still an amazing cut - slightly more spongy/meaty texture but still with a generous amt of melted fat. The US wagyu  is actually quite similar to the angus beef... in fact I think I actually prefer the angus beef a little bit more.  Their other meats - chicken was quite nice, the pork belly and sausage were both very good... but what left an impression was their beef toro, miso marinated salmon and the clams. The clams come in a tin just like some of the sides with two holes at the top for steam to escape. the clams were juicy, fresh and delicious! The salmon - i don't normally like to order that for BBQ AYCE... but with the miso - it's amazing - the salmon was still juicy and tasty on the inside and not dry at all! The toro beef is almost like a thin beef brisket cut, with some sweet soy sauce marinade, it can be addictive - the angus beef and this were my favourites among the regular AYCE beef menu.  The sides are nice - the bibimbap egg was a bit tough, but i liked the toppings, the rice was a bit soo soft though (not sure if it's the sauce, but i like the fact it's not a ton of rice). The soba noodles were great in taste, but could use a bit more al dente. I don't normally eat lamb, but the little bit I did try, it was well seasoned - i think you would probably enjoy the lamb chops too if you're a lamb lover.  Another highlight for a side, is their kimchi soup - it's quite different from miso soup, i liked that it was unique, it's almost like a tomato based kimchi soup - it's got a nice hint of spice but at the same time the sweetness of the tomato in the soup really balances out the flavours. I woudl've gotten a second bowl if i didn't have to leave room for food!  Their drinks menu - I tried the superfruit tea and the mango yakult. Both were AMAZING! the mango and yakult go really well together - their strawberry one is also just as good. The superfruit tea is sweet and refreshing - almost like a cold version of a fruit tea you get at a BBT shop. I would like it a bit less sweet, but otherwise it was great and i ate the fruit inside :) I also had one of their alcoholic drinks - the yuzu honey and sojo presse - it was fizzy with a nice hint of grapefruit and soda :)   However, their dessert needs a bit of an upgrade. hence the 0.5 star off - however I know they only opened 2 months ago, so hopefully as the restaurant gets steady, they might consider opening up the menu more for this section. each customer gets 1 melona as a dessert.. for an AYCE i honestly expected at least something else that can be an AYCE item.   Def will come back again :)"}
{"text":"If i can give zero stars i would!  1) They gave my husband warm beer. Then gave us ice cubes to make it cold, then ordered another beer.. again they gave us warm beer.   2) We had a party of 7. We ordered 7 mango slush. Only 5 came, with only 3 spoons! So again we ordered 7 mango slush with 7 spoon (yes had to emphasize on how many spoons we wil need)! Only 2 slush came with 2 spoons!  3) We ordered a watermelon juice pitcher 5 times, waited over an hour... and it never came. Finally the server told us that the bartender won't make pitchers but willing to make individual glasses (no explanation as to why...).  A pitcher is $15, each glass is $5. So we ended up paying more to get water downed and overly sweetened with sugar watermelon juice!  It was way too sweet, obviously sweetened by something, it was not a natural sweet taste.   4) By 8:30pm, they ran out of desserts, only one choice left.  5) They never got our food order correct either! Ordered 20 pieces of shrimp.. only 7 came, when we told the server we asked for 20, he said he only gave 7 because they only come in 7... ok? He didn't think to give us two plates of 7? 14 is closer to 20?! Ordered corn 3 different times... that also never came! Made 3 separate food orders, not once was it correct.   6) Reseevations for 6pm, didn't get a table til 6:35pm.  Not too long of a wait for us but you can tell they were very disorganized at the front with the long line of people.   7) Overall, food was okay. I think Gyubee is a better choice.  If you at my picture of kimchi soup, thick layer of oil on top."}
{"text":"We have been hearing a lot about this restaurant and finally get a chance to come here tonight to try the food.  The restaurant offer two packages with different pricing.  Standard AYCE Angus  beef meal and AYCE wagyu beef meal.   The AYCE wagyu beef meal comes with Australian sirloin steak and US brisket short rib.  You can make separate order (extra charge) on Japanese A5, Australian M6+, and US Wagyu.  We have ate each of the Wagyu beef tonight and the quality is top notch.  The Japanese A5 were the rib eye beef, it taste so good that it just melt in my mouth.  The Australian M6+ is good as well, it is not as fatty as Japanese A5 but does not melt in my mouth.  I personally like the A5 more.  Not to forget, they also serve Angus beef.  Their Angus beef is very high quality too and for those who doesn't want to spend too much money, standard package is a decent choice with Angus beef.  For the meat, they have special  sauce and spice herb that can be apply on it and it's wonderfully delicious.  They also offer a lot of side dishes such as chicken, salmon, beef brisket, lamb, vegetables, mushroom, soup etc.. They even have kimchi tofu soup that I really like.  I've been to many restaurants and they never offer kimchi tofu soup but this restaurant offer it.  It's spicy but I like it.  For those who cannot take the spice can go with miso soup.  Forgot to mention, they also have a nice drink menu.  I tried out their super fruit and mango yakult drink and it is very good.  Normally, you would think after you finished with the BBQ, your clothes would be smelly.  However this is not the case at Shinta.  I find their air circulation very well.  They don't need to have a big vent above the cook stove like those traditional BBQ place.  My clothes still smell fresh after eating there. They must have put a lot of thought in the air circulation and the cook stove they use. Customer Service was attentive and follow up with all our order.  Desert menu need to improve but overall it was a wonderful experience tonight and I definitely will come back again for more."}
{"text":"As most reviews here are very harsh and more on the negative side, I was hesitant to give this place a go. This restaurant is still \"new\" and the wait for a table ended up being about 2 hours (on weekends expect a longer wait but parties of 6 people or more can make a reservation by phone). Service here is horrible to say the least, there was a lot of miscommunication between the hostess at the front and the servers - leading to very frustrated customers. Also, at times it was hard to get a hold of the server to order more food/drinks.   Shinta located in Richmond Hill offers two AYCE options - Angus Beef AYCE (on weekdays it's $31.99 and on weekends it's $34.99.) and Wagyu AYCE (on weekdays it's $69.99 and on weekends it's $71.99). Please note, there is a 2 hour seating limit so be prepared to be bombarded with all the food at once.   The food was average at best but mostly disappointing in comparison to other BBQ joints. As others mentioned, some of the marinade overpowered the meat plus the cuts of the meat was very thin and as a result, got stuck to the grill often. There wasn't anything that stood out to be honest, aside from the obvious that the Wagyu tasted tender and \"better quality\".   Overall, I do not recommend this place. For the price, I would rather go elsewhere. But if you must, wait out the \"hype\" unless you're willing to wait awhile to get seated."}
{"text":"After reading a bunch of reviews and realizing that people's negativity revolved around having to wait too long or not getting a free plate of Wagyu or the place being too expensive, I had to roll my eyes and try the place myself because quite frankly, those are not real reasons to hate on a restaurant.  And for once, I didn't rely on Yelp reviews and I'm glad I didn't.  *Gasp*   When we went in, we were greeted by a manager called Irene, who was managing the lineup for tables.  She did initially seem a bit brusque but after talking with her once we were seated, we could tell that she was just really stressed out and actually a genuinely nice person.  She told us it would be a 1-1.5 hour wait and knowing that, we agreed and just sat and waited.  We did end up waiting for an hour on a Monday night before we got a table.  However, it was expected, being a new restaurant and all.    We opted for the $70 AYCE Wagyu option because it felt like it was worth the most.  That said, you can always get a \"normal\" AYCE option and order a place of their extra premium Wagyu if you wanted.  If you look closely at their menu, the AYCE option only contains the Australian and Canadian Wagyu beef option.  They do have an A5 option that you can order separately at $100 a plate.  However, there are a few kinds of Wagyu that they do not offer in their AYCE.    Overall though, our $70 AYCE option was delicious.  We were given a plum tea to start (no refills but free) and water afterwards as drinks but you can order drinks should you wish.  The Wagyu that we got was quite delicious and we did have a few other things as well, which were also great but we were on a mission to eat as much Wagyu as possible.  However, definitely take a break from the Wagyu at some point and try their lemongrass pork - that was to die for.    At the end, we were very satisfied with our experience at Shinta.  Irene stopped by our table and chatted with us and checked in periodically.  We were satisfied with the taste of the food.  And we had realistic expectations going in.  Tips to keep in mind when you go there because it's still new:   a) If you don't want to wait that long, then don't come.  But don't write a horrible review on a restaurant just because you got hangry.  It's a popular spot because everyone is curious and apparently, you are curious about how it is too :).    b) The menu is very self-explanatory.  You have a non-Wagyu option and  a Wagyu option.  It is your perogative to choose which one you want.    c) Know that you aren't offered an A5 AYCE option.  Quite frankly, expecting that would be super unrealistic.      This is definitely a once in a while place for the sake of your blood pressure/vessels, etc.  But it's definitely worth visiting at least once!  So haters gonna hate...go try it! :)"}
{"text":"super slow service. super not organized waiters. waiting 1h for just water... dont have too much expectation..."}
{"text":"Tip # 1 - Do not go as a group of 6 people, you will be squeezed into a table designed for 4 people, even though you made reservations over a month in advance...   Tip # 2 - Order the meats first, specifically, the beef and lamb items, they take forever to come to the table. I find that pretty shady for AYCE.  We had a pretty bad first experience at Shinta and it was unfortunate because we were celebrating Father's day and it would have been difficult to get a table elsewhere without a reservation. We had made reservations over a month in advance and they seated us at a booth designed for 4 people with an extra chair added to the end. The same booth next to us had 2 people seated there... When we explained to the hostess that this didn't make any sense, she had the audacity to attempt to blame us, and said she thought our reservation was for 5 people (Note: We never altered this reservation, it was always for 6 people. Your mistake is not our fault.); the manager eventually showed us another option and it was a table with 2 grills designed for 8 people, but we weren't allowed to have the second grill and they put up a wall to divide that table in half and added two chairs to the end to fit us. He did throw in a pitcher of watermelon juice to make amends... I would have preferred proper seating.   Food - It was mostly good. We did the Angus AYCE. Be cautious of the lettuce, it's not the cleanest. Beef cuts are pretty limited here in comparison to other Japanese AYCE BBQ.   Service - The servers were somewhat slow and forgetful but overall nice.   I guess I would come back if I was craving Japanese BBQ and in the area but I know better places to go to instead, and I would never come back as a group of 6 people."}
{"text":"Ok, I would like to talk about the positive things about this place before I trash on this place. This place has a good variety of meats and also different cuts of meat compared to their competitors. The restaurant is quite spacious and can handle many group dinners. There are a variety of alcoholic drinks and non-alcoholic drinks that you can order that are not too expensive. There are two AYCE options where you can pick either the $34.99 (weekend price) Regular AYCE and the $71.99 (weekend price) AYCE that includes wagyu. I went for the regular AYCE so I cannot give any opinion regarding their wagyu option. But honestly there is no way that their wagyu is crème de la crème if they are offering an all you can eat option.   Now onto the bad, in my opinion, this was one of the worst dining experiences I ever had in my life.   SERVICE:  The fire alarm went off (seems like it was a false alarm) while we were eating at the restaurant and it went on for about 20 minutes. The waitress was reassuring us that it would end in 2 minutes but no, it ended like 20 minutes after. There was no way we could evacuate given the fact it was raining outside so we would have to wait for it to stop first. After the firefighters came to turn it off, we did not receive any apology from manager nor did we receive any type of discount from the restaurant for the trauma we have just endured. Instead, the waitress told us we only have 40 mins left to dine and that was it. In addition, the waiters kept bringing us food that we didn't order. Also, it was our friend's birthday and we brought a cake and requested the waitress to put it on the plate before bringing it out to the birthday girl. The waitress just brought the bag out and handed it to one of our friends. We just asked for a simple request and the waitress only had one job and couldn't even do it. All in all, it is evident that the waiters/waitresses here need to be trained better. This is unacceptable. There is also a mandatory tip when you have a large group of people and the waitress clearly did not deserve that 12% tip.   FOOD:  The quality of meat was mediocre at most (I felt unwell afterwards) and the grill cooked so slowly even at high heat. Their meat marinade is considered better than their competitors but this still can't hide the fact that the meats are not of quality. Also, this entire meal was greasy.   Their dessert menu is a joke. I know this is a place to eat \"Japanese bbq\" but even most AYCE establishments have a few options for dessert and usually are in unlimited amounts (when reasonable). Here, you are only obligated to have ONE melona bar and that is it. This restaurant is ridiculously cheap.  In summary, with the meat being mediocre and with bad service, I don't think I will come to this establishment ever again. I would advise everyone to not go unless they want to get traumatized."}
{"text":"We decided to visit Shinta on grand opening day. We were a group of 6 eager to try out this brand new Wagyu ayce restaurant. When we arrived an hour early there was already a long line of people waiting outside the restaurant.  As a part of the grand opening promo we got to try one free platter of US/AU Wagyu. I was able to see the marbling of the meat when it was raw but upon cooking it the meat shrunk to a small thin slice. We were careful with these pieces as the thinness of the beef and the fat was fueling the fire and made it easy to burn. As a part of the promotion, we got to try 4 slices each. Upon eating it I found that the texture of the meat was softer than the other meat varieties but the taste was just okay. It did not quite melt in my mouth but it was softer. In terms of the taste I found that the Kalbi short ribs was actually tastier. The Kalbi was well marinated and the fatty areas that melted along with it made it taste good.  Shinta does offer a good variety of meat varieties such as marinated Kalbi short ribs, beef brisket, lamb, pork belly, sauasage etc. For the meats I found that the Kalbi and the sausage were tasty. The lamb was served in big chunks so took the longest to cook. As well they did not neglect veggie options by also offering mushrooms, brocolli, asparagus, corn, enoki mushrooms, and okra which actually tasted good when soaked in butter. The only down side about the vegetables is that they are served wrapped in chunks of aluminum foil so it occupies a lot of space on the grill.  The dessert options were yuzu ice cream, vanilla ice cream, and lychee mango slush. The menu had indicated ayce desserts but unfortunately they had already run out of dessert by 8pm but offered 2 mango lychee slush per person.  The food options were good and the food was alright but I would say it is average and not worth the high price point. Definitely be prepared for slow service and the possibility that desserts may run out as well"}
{"text":"Open concept configuration. I was worried about ventilation but it turned out to not be a problem at all.  House yuzu dipping soya sauce to go with the Japanese A5 wagyu, Australian wagyu, and American wagyu, along with other Japanese marbled beef, organic pork with lemon grass, chicken, ox tongue, lamb, house made sausage, beef short ribs, pork belly, tacoyaki, prawns, shrimps in cheese (cooked in foil container), corn with butter bbqed in foil container, zucchini, enoki mushrooms, salmons, and veggies. My pick is Australian wagyu.  You get to bbq your veggies in a personal foil container.  The drink list is great.  Super Fruits and Strawberry Yakult are must-try items.  My fave is their Japanese sweet stout.  They have some plum options too.    Friendly service.  Very clean and tidy place.  Attractive and pleasant decor.  Clean bathrooms.  Fair noise level.   Seating booths are a bit inflexible, best to go in parties of 4 or 8.  There is a party room that holds 60 if you need to host a private function.  Staff are new and still need some time.  Service is friendly and helpful nonetheless.  Rebecca, Nana, Cherry, and Irene were very responsive and helpful, despite the big crowds and understaffing situation. TIP: book in advance, or come back at 2-hour intervals.  Go in parties of 4 or 8 for most effective seating, to make an even distribution of 4 people per grill.  THUMBS UP: I didn't not come out smelling like BBQ pork.  Thanks a lot for a great evening."}
{"text":"Group of three, paid for the Wagyu AYCE and an extra order of the Jap Wagyu, plus drinks, total bill is a bit over $400. Is it worth it? Not really. But I would go back to this place again because the meat quality is really good. I will definitely go for the regular AYCE and just order the wagyu extra.   When we asked for more Aus and US wagyu (included in the wagyu AYCE menu), we didn't get the full order. We got half of what we ordered. Missing quantities when you order the most expensive item on the menu is not uncommon at AYCE places, but if you are paying double the regular AYCE price just for the wagyu and they don't bring them to you......  When we said it's our first time there, the server suggested to bring us a bit of everything on the menu so we can taste them and then order whichever we like. That sounded like a great idea so we agreed. But it was not \"a bit\" of everything. After we finished the first round, we were all nearly full.  Service is as expected for AYCE restaurants. We made reservation for 6, but couldn't get there until 620. Called me at 6 to ask if we are still showing up, and said due to their 2 hours limit, the table has another reservation at 8, so last order at 730. I said fine, since we are late for our time. When we arrived, we were reminded again that although we were late, we still need to get out before 8. Then we were reminded again when we place our first order....  Restaurant is new and pleasant. Clean. Table space is sufficient, as long as you don't get \"a bit\" of eveything...  Meat quality is really good and they are marinated really well. Most of the meat on their regular AYCE menu tasted great. The Jap wagyu was amazing."}
{"text":"Please NEVER ever come to this place!  The meat quality is good. However, the WORST experience of all you can eat restaurant ever! We ordered wangyu and they cut the order, we ordered 20 piece and they only gave us 6. The manager directly told us we cut order. The speed of providing food is SLOW. And they kicked you out as soon as you reach 2 hour limit."}
{"text":"I recommend all the limited offer items, especially the sweet potatoes. The Chinese style lamb also tastes good. If you want to order Wagyu AYCE, the US one tastes better. The price for kids is very expensive. My sister is 10 years old and she has a tiny stomach. But the price for her is the same as adults."}
{"text":"This is a newly opened Japanese BBQ ayce place. It's more expensive but with a bit more varieties. The famous thing here is the ayce wagyu beef. It cost $70+ per person! I mean the price is okay for ayce wagyu beef. However, the restaurant was very hesitant in bring in wagyu beef. We asked for 20 pieces, they tried to cheat and only provide us 15 to limit what we eat. Who knows I would count, eh? I don't actually count normally, the reason why I counted was because the server suggested 15 and we wanted 20, and the server was totally not happy about it immediately. She started giving us attitude. She stopped responding to our questions, but just be nodding or shaking her head. She stopped making eye contact with us and started giving us the poker face. She clearly doesn't want to communicate with us at all. We came in late too, so we wanted to make sure we have enough for the last call. We were also missing orders, the server might have done it on purpose because she knew it was the last call and we were not able to order more.  We understand it was late at night and she prob. was tired and may had a bad day, so we tried to be very polite to her, smile at her, always thanked her, but we were quite intimidated by her rude attitude because we don't want our food to be ruined. Terrible service! I would suggest to train the server better in the future.   Now let's talk about the food. All meat were marinated so u don't taste the original flavour. The marinate was very sweet too! Im okay with sweet meat but ALL kind of meat there were sweet which was a bit too much for me. I prefer original flavour, or at least the high quality meat such as wagyu beef should be!  If any one wants good Jap bbq and nice service, go to Gyubee!   This one star is for the secretary Judy at the front. She was very pleasant to talk to."}
{"text":"Shinta has too much mix reviews but here is my personal experience. Came on a Tuesday for 6 people.  Upon sitting down the place looks nice and spacious.  We opted for the regular at AYCE which I think the most worth it. And did ala Carte wagyu.   For the good stuff, takoyaki was good, the lamb chop, and the lamb for the bbq were excellent.  Bibimbap is good option to have. The garlic shrimp and the salmon were both good. Seasoning we're both good.  For beef enjoyed the tongue and the short ribs.  Wasn't a fan of the pork dishes that came I think they were pretty bland and needs a lot of the condiments.   We got the Australian and US wagyu. The us wagyu was melt in your mouth goodness! While the Australian wagyu has more of a chew which was unexpected. US wagyu wins in my opinion.   We had a minor set backs with food coming too little for a party of 6 getting meat for 2 people. This was addressed quickly by the server/s and the food came in abundance. Yes we were taken care of well, a little to well maybe.    All in all shinta is a good option for Japanese bbq/ Korean style. I think it's better than gyubee, gratuity is added to the bill!   Thank you shinta for a good experience and I would definitely recommend to people."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by Shinta, considering the very mixed reviews from this place. At first I thought only AYCE Wagyu was available, but it turns out there is a regular AYCE menu as well.  The regular AYCE menu features really good quality Angus beef, and it was a delight to eat - flavourful & tender. We did try the premium items during our visit. The Kagoshima Japanese A5 wagyu practically melts in your mouth and was extremely flavourful. Considering the large price tag of $65/$90 (200g/300g) and the fact that this is not part of the AYCE, I would say this item is recommended only for people with deep pockets.   The Australian Wagyu and US Wagyu are both available if you go with the AYCE Wagyu - while both tender and juicy, they are not quite as flavourful as the Japanese version. It will cost you slightly more than double the regular AYCE to enjoy these items. I would suggest first-timers to get the regular AYCE and try the premium Australian/US Wagyu as an add-on ($20 for 200g) to see if the premium AYCE is right for them.  I loved the fact that they have sake steamed clams (even though the portion itself was small - only 4 clams, but you can always order more!), thick cut lamb chops, lamb cubes, and salmon. Veggie-wise, they have Okra which I love. Considering the large variety of items here, I would say that Shinta edges out Gyubee by a large margin. Pricing-wise it was a dollar or two more, and I would say it is worth paying for.  Service is definitely the area where I think issues might come up. Since the AYCE sessions are limited to 2 hours, diners might feel ripped off if items come at a slow pace especially if they paid for the premium AYCE. While I did not experience any major delays in ordering/getting items on my visit, I can see that as a potential issue during busy weekends if they don't have enough staff.  I appreciate the fact that the ventilation here is great. I did not smell of BBQ at the end of the night, which is a huge bonus!  They do take reservations here even for small groups - I would highly recommend doing so.  Overall, I think this is now my new favourite Japanese BBQ place! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Not bad, but not great either. We had reservations for 615pm, and had no issue getting seated (dinner service was just ramping up). As this was our first time here we went for the AYCE wagyu dinner. Service was very good until it started to get busy. As many have stated it gets very busy and they are not staffed accordingly.   The food was descent but nothing out of the ordinary in comparison to their competitors. For the price we would probably opt out for a return as the same quality, atmosphere, and service can be had elsewhere for considerably less."}
{"text":"I was putting a LOT on the line by choosing to spend my birthday here at Shinta... especially after hearing all the reviews about poor service and food.   So I took the risk. I DID make a reservation just in case there was a lineup. I made the reservation for 7:30 PM on a Tuesday night. The restaurant was very spacious and I absolutely loved the dining space and seats. So far, the experience was good. Our server introduced herself and explained about our seating limit and instructions on how to order. She was very attentive and patient, which I was happy about.  We opted for the regular AYCE BBQ dinner without the wagyu and started ordering food. I started out with 15 pieces of each of the meats including beef, pork, chicken, and lamb. The marinated kalbi was my favourite. It was very nicely seasoned and super tender. The sausages were also really yummy. The slices of pork belly just melted in my mouth and is perfect when dipped in the seasoning powder they provide. The lamb cubes were absolutely delicious and tender. I really love the lamb that they serve here. It reminds me of the Chinese lamb skewers I love. The lamb chop is surprisingly tender however it's hard to eat it with just chopsticks.   The seafood that they offered was also quite delicious. I love the garlic shrimp and those SAKE CLAMS.... It was honestly my favourite item on the menu. These clams are cooked in a savoury sweet sake broth which really highlighted the flavour profile of the clams. I couldn't help getting more and more of these clams.   My orders were brought out very accurately and in a timely manner. The server was kind enough to explain any questions we had. I just loved this experience. I'm really glad that they are aware of the negative reviews and are finally doing something to change their reputation."}
{"text":"Went to their soft opening today... Though they said it opens at 430pm, there were already a few people lining up at 315pm. The bf and I went at 330pm and already 10+ people in front of us. Luckily, the owner was nice to let all of those in the front to go inside rather than wait in the cold. So, at 430pm yeah yeah it was their opening time but we didn't get seated til 445pm.   The place was bright and spacious. Waiter was really nice and told us all the rules- 2 hours limit and a last call would be notified.   We ordered, the appetizers came really quick but the meat? That was a bit of a wait... We had to order them twice and a second later, both orders showed up which turned out to be a bit too much of what we ordered BUT we managed to finish all food. Food quality- amazing marble on the prime kalbi short rib, all meats were tender with perfect amount of seasoning- not too salty or lack or flavours  Wagyu beef- free for each table today only... Honestly though, other than it tasted more sweeter and more fat than regular beef, its not worth to pay out of pocket  HIGHLY RECOMMEND- prime kalbi short rib, lemon grass pork chop, lamb rack, takoyaki"}
{"text":"I came here with just one other person on a not so busy night. The wait was only half an hour. Large selection of side dishes! Thinly sliced portions (maybe too thin) of meat and responsive staff. 1 star taken off for rude hostess and automatic tip added. Tipping is completely optional and should not be automatically included on the bill. I watched the witness repeatedly say DO YOU HAVE A RESERVATION, louder and louder each time to a grandpa that clearly did speak or understand English. The grandpa held up two fingers when he came up to the hostess and didn't mutter any English, yelling at him in English wouldn't have  helped lol. Also, the dessert menu was limited to just one melona bar (which I hate melona). The dessert menu could be bigger by including actual ice cream and small puddings. Last note, the servers kept giving us food we didn't order and we had to ask them to take it back a few times. All in all, good quality of foods for what you pay for, wide selection as well but the service could be better."}
{"text":"Went there on Saturday and there are huge line up but luckily we made reservation so we only waited 5 minutes. They have more food options compared to Gyubee but the dipping sauce taste the same- I was expected they offer more variety on the dipping sauce.The quality of the meat overall is pretty good and we ordered extra Wagyu on a side. Service was abit slow but overall experience was great and I will come back again."}
{"text":"I visited ?the restaurant with my ex-colleagues last night.  The foods were too? salty and too much MSG, I drank so much water after dinner. Very bad service when they needed a table for the next customers, we had a 6:30 reservation and some of my friends went there 15 mins early and they mentioned table needed another reservation at 8:30, we told them we would be leaving? at 8:30 but the waitress asked us to leave? at 8:05 because we came early and they count from the starting time.  They sent couple ppl to tried to kick us away because the other customers needed a table."}
{"text":"We visited Shinta on the Grand opening day. I had arrived around 3:15 pm only to find a handful of people hovering around the front door. That all quickly changed with the line more than doubling in a matter of a few minutes. Shinta started allowing the first group of people to be seated around 4:30 at their opening time. However they were only letting one group in every 5-10 minutes or so even though there were alot of empty tables that could be seen. Once inside and my group of 6 was seated I noticed the decor of the decor of the restaurant was light and airy and did not have the smokey suffocating smells that other bbqs  places usually have.  It was disappointing once we were seated that only 1 grill was given for a party of 6. It posed a challenge cooking the food and we were left waiting for most of the night for food to cook and felt rushed with the time limit. The initial order of food we placed became somewhat of a disaster. Only a portion of the food we ordered had come (mainly side dishes) and the meat which we were highly anticipating was no where to be found. After several attempts to flag a server down and to remind him of our order the food started coming.   The food was average at best. The Wagyu of course was soft and  tender however I feel it was fattier than the normal cuts of Wagyu. The rack of lamb was too thick to be cooked fully and we had to use a knife to cut it into smaller chunks. Another downfall of the visit was desserts were not unlimited. Of the 3 options available (yuzu, vanilla ice cream and mango slush) only the mango slush was available and it was limited to 2 per person.   Overall I would not return for another visit unless much needed improvements in service and food. The visit was very underwhelming especially after all the hype on social media platforms such as Facebook and Instagram."}
{"text":"WHAT TO TRY?!  If you dare, try the all you can eat Wagyu beef! (It will come with a hefty price of $70+ dollars though!!) the other choice would be the all you can eat angus beef! Both are great options but both have different price points.   I tried both wagyu and angus beef, if you don't want to spend the hefty price of $70, then angus beef ayce is fine!   I did try the wagyu beef ayce and it was delicious too! Mind you, the right way to fully get your value for the wagyu beef is to focus your ayce stomach to just the wagyu and don't get tempted by other food items on the list or else you'll fill yourself up real quick!  If you do choose wagyu ayce, be prepared for the service being slow, especially on days when they're super busy to get your your wagyu beef. I suggest you to order the next orders the moment you get a plate if you plan to eat a lot more wagyu beef. That way, you'll enjoy your beef and they can start preparing for your next order!   There are two types of wagyu beef they can offer in your ayce price and you can have both. The Australian and the US wagyu. Our family tend to like the US wagyu more because it was fattier and the meat was more marbleized. Australian wagyu had more meat, less fat, so the texture wasn't as \"melt in your mouth\" type. Can be somewhat tough if you overcook it so keep a close eye on the beef slices because they cook fast! They also offer Japanese Kobe beef but the Kobe is not included in the ayce pricing. You'll have to order separately and each plate can easily start at $90. Angus beef is like beef short ribs but sliced and comes out deboned so the texture of the angus beef slices were tender and juicy.   The place is very clean and the grills are sophisticated. Embedded within the table, the servers also come by to replace your wire rack every so often.   LAST TIP?!  If you don't like the thickness of the beef, see if the waiters can let the kitchen know to cut it thicker. Some will fulfill your request while others don't help you ask the kitchen. But it doesn't hurt to ask, so why not ask!"}
{"text":"I came for the AYCE wagyu and was really impressed by the quality of the meat. Both types (Australian and US wagyu) offered on the AYCE menu were delicious, but I had a slight preference for the Australian - amazing marbling that melts in your mouth. I also tried the kagoshima Japanese a5 wagyu, which came as slightly thicker and longer slices of meat with even more beautiful marbling (extra charge $95 for 300g and $65 for 200g). I would definitely recommend it if you are okay with doubling your bill, but if you're on a budget the regular wagyu is almost as good. The veggies were also fresh and delicious - especially loved the honey sweet potato (but on the menu it said this item was limited)  As for the service, it's a really busy place with a full house and line ups. Sometimes it's a little difficult to get a server's attention but I had no issues with the speed of service.   Overall, I had a great experience and preferred this place over gyubee. My only wish is that they had a downtown location... :)"}
{"text":"I came here for the soft opening and honestly the waygu was way too thin for what you're paying for. I'd recommend Gyubee over this anyday; especially since its half the price of this... not worth it."}
{"text":"We've been eyeing this place for months. Finally we have an excuse to dine here. Birthday celebration!  First of all, you need a reservation here. There's a line up when we got there. Btw, they tell you that you have only 2 hours or you're kicked out. We were seated in a closed room of at least 20-30 people but noticed they do have proper ventilation. With grills in every table, it was not smelly. Well, we didn't go for the $72 per person just the standard $32 per person. All you can eat, meat, shrimps, veggies whatever's on the list. I'm not impressed with the marinated shrimps. Quality of beef and pork is good. Honestly the food tasted more like Korean bbq. The grill is clean. They change it after a few use. They gave you Melona popsicle 1 per person for dessert. Then this kid threw up in front of our table. Disgusting. Not the kid's fault but before this happened, I'm not really impressed with this restaurant.  Overall okay but I will not come back. But you'll never know."}
{"text":"Had the wagu beef all you can eat. The first few plates of the Australia wagu looked decent. However, after the first few plates, the meat didn't look the same quality even tho they claimed that it was all Australian wagu.   We overheard the table beside us had the same complain. I don't think it would be a coincidence. Would not go back again"}
