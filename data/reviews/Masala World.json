{"text":"The blandest, least flavorful, Indian food I have ever had. Chicken Tikka Masala and \"Veggie Korma\" tasted like watery tomato soup. The naan was smothered in \"butter\" and microwaved. The white rice tasted instant and the  \"veggie rice\" looked like they're added food coloring and a few sad peas. Finally the mango lassi tasted like water a mango fell in.   Not recommended. I threw mine away and ordered something else."}
{"text":"I stopped here yesterday after reading about it in one of the local papers. I don't have the words to express how bad it was. I ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala and Palak Paneer. All I got was a Styrofoam plate with 3 sections full of grease. There was no cheese in the paneer; it was just spinach. The chicken was shredded and there was so much oil in it that I could barely eat it. The rice was not basmati, or if it was it was the most flavorless basmati I've ever had. I had a stomach ache for the rest of the day because of the grease. I would never recommend this place to anyone. Oh, and the only person working was on his phone the whole time except when he slopped the food on my paper plate.  If I could give this place zero stars I would!"}
{"text":"Great tasty Indian food! I was so pleased with my dish. For being in a mall its not a chain like one would expect but more like a mom and pop homemade food kind of place. I'm definitely coming again."}
{"text":"Not quite as good as the Indian place that was here before this one, but still really good. I grab a quick lunch from here at least once a week. Food is good and the place is kept clean. They have a nice selection of vegetarian options, so, that makes me happy. A-OK for food court food."}
