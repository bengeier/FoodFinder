{"text":"Cheap food...bad atmosphere and it looks like everyone here hates their job."}
{"text":"This may not be the fanciest place in Pittsburgh but it provides a great, quick lunch which is what I often need when I am downtown. I had the Greek Salad. The dressing was amazing, you can tell that it was homemade. It was very large and filled me up. I enjoyed Apollo a lot and plan on returning."}
{"text":"Cash only! Great place for homemade food. I particularly enjoy the soup here."}
{"text":"The Turkey deluxe with sourdough bread is the best sandwich I have ever had.  I have ordered it 5 times total.  I also love the breakfast burrito with Sausage.  I have had it twice and it feels me up so much that I don't have to eat until dinner time.  Great place."}
{"text":"This is an excellent, low-priced, fast lunch spot in an area lacking them.   Don't misunderstand: this place is no-frills. Cafeteria-style counter service with a chalkboard menu, they do your average salads, sandwiches, and basic desserts. The service is not particularly friendly, and the food is basic and not fancy. However, it's awfully nice to have a quick little place to grab a bite, alone or with a friend, for well under $10 (especially one that's not a chain!).   Another plus of this is its convenient location - for those meeting a friend downtown, it's nearly central (just by Macy's) and can be walked to in about 5 minutes from any location in downtown.   Hardly a world-changer, but a nice little place I'll go back to again and again over the months.  CASH ONLY!!!"}
{"text":"Dear Yelp Readers,  This small place in the bottom of the 19-story Allegheny Building on Forbes is a small cafeteria style restaurant with mostly home-cooked-like meals, complete with bright red trays.  No diner-like service would be complete without the fast talking always-in-a-hurry blunt order taker.  A friend and I ordered grilled chicken salads --- one of the healthier things on the menu. They were good enough to quench the mid-day hunger of your average office worker, but certainly pale in comparison to nearby places like Zorba's --- despite a similar price point.  We possibly made an error in ordering...... perhaps the reuben, grilled cheese with bacon, or the many \"melts\" (surely served with mashed potatoes and gravy) would have been more popular, and more squarely in the wheel house of the cooks.  The girl keeping the tables and chairs clean was friendly and doing a good job.  The menu, the food, and experience was mostly forgettable, and I'm not sure we'll remember to go back.  Hyphenatedly yours...."}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast spot downtown. It's a shame it's only open on weekdays. When ordering breakfast, make sure you order the potatoes because they are amazing. Nothing on the breakfast menu has let me down. The lunch menu isn't bad either, but lunch items don't taste quite as homemade. For instance, the burger tastes kind of like a frozen patty. And the customer service could improve: the cashier usually isn't that nice. The breakfast may be enough to overcome the unfriendly service, though!"}
{"text":"I came downstairs to the Apollo only because I'm on a gluten-free diet and I couldn't eat anything in the breakfast my employer was serving; the Apollo was downstairs and was literally the closest restaurant to my office.  But I had a delightful surprise.  I ordered small coffee and a bacon and feta omelet.  The omelet was very nice, with the cheese melted and good bacon.  The potatoes that came with it were excellent, brown and crisp, much better than typical diner potatoes.  The coffee was fine.   Total bill was $6.10.  I would definitely return, even if I had to go a couple of blocks out of my way."}
{"text":"For a company \"cafe\"teria... this is not a bad place. For its convenience since it's on campus and their daily specials change weekly. The prices are kinda steep but that's the price you pay for convenience and the lack of nearby restaurants that are less than 15 mins away. I've tried their \"home\" section with their roasted pork sirloin or oven roasted chicken, it's actually edible, not excellent but it's good nonetheless. I sometimes feel at times depending on the time of day, the choices become limited and they really do not accommodate those who have lunch after 1pm. Some soups are alright too mainly their clam chowder and their chicken noodle. They're satisfactory. But the prices are killer but I am accustomed to this since I previously worked at the ASU tempe campus and the prices at the memorial union were quite steep as well. So if you're looking for a place for a quick lunch or something to pick up to bring back to your desk, this is not a bad alternative."}
{"text":"I hope the people who wrote reviews before me are just kidding.   This cafe is awful and overpriced. maybe we're not talking about the same place?  i once got 2 slices of wheat toast and a large diet coke. how much did it cost? $7.50!   this place has nasty microwaved food for way more than any of it is worth.   they go to costco and buy things, then wrap them up and sell them for $2-4 a piece.  I once brought my dinner to class but needed a fork. they wanted to charge me for a fork.   this place makes me angry, all the people who work there are slow and dumb.    there's a jack in the box up the street and when we have time to leave we go there and are much happier and don't spend $7 on something like a microwaved soft pretzel."}
{"text":"A good, old fashioned place for lunch. Would give them 5 stars but the amount of cornstarch in the soup is insane. Like, so much. But overall a great place."}
{"text":"The staff here was so nice, and the food is delicious, it feels very much like a hometown place. I had a rueben and homemade lemonade and both were great!"}
{"text":"As far as food goes, this place is almost always great, as far as customer service goes - they could be a bit friendlier. I've been three times in the last two weeks because I've enjoyed the lunches I've picked up, but the ladies working are almost always unpleasant, snippy and rude. I understand it can get crowded, but even when I put on a smile and niceness - they are tough as nails.   So - I like the food - but the last two times I've left I keep wondering why I go back only to be treated like something unpleasant they've found on the floor."}
{"text":"Stopping in around noon on Monday, this place was buzzing! The staff was very friendly and they had a variety of options on the menu. We settled on cups of broccoli cheddar soup and a half turkey sandwich (there is a 1/2 cold sandwich / soup combo deal). The food was fine for a cafe - I would return, but what I had wasn't much different than other cafe's in town. There is extra seating upstairs so even though it was busy, there were seating options.  After we had checked out and begun eating we realized the food was either expensive or we were accidentally charged extra. Not concerned enough to ask, but the bill for 2 cups of soup, a half sandwich and two drinks came to $15. (again, might have just been a mistake).  I'll stop in again for soup and to see the friendly faces behind the counter!"}
{"text":"Apollo Cafe is still a solid, unpretentious place to get a decent lunch.  I met up here with a friend of mine this past week. I opted for my usual soup & half a sandwich combo.  Now my ham sandwich was good, but that Greek lemon with rice soup was o-so heavenly.  Their menu is right--their soups are almost meals unto themselves!  I don' remember what Lisa had for her lunch, but we did share an order of carrot cake for dessert.  Yum!"}
{"text":"Nice breakfast and lunch spot. Only reason I took off one star was because it opens at 7...then same time I start work. The good is good, priced right and the staff is friendly. Saw a dish I want to go back and try so tomorrow I just may do that. Today I had a greek salad with grilled chicken. The chicken was seasoned just right. The salad was fresh and service was super fast. Great for take out."}
{"text":"Apollo Cafe is one of the best breakfast spots in downtown Pittsburgh. Apollo opens early for those early workers to have a hot meal before starting the morning shift. I love the Mediterranean/Greek feel to the atmosphere of the cafe. The food is very good and at an affordable price for eat in or take out. I have always enjoyed the friendly staff that greets you in the morning to start your day with a smile.   I have tried all the Omelets and highly recommend. The food is fresh, hot and delicious.  I have been to Apollo mostly for breakfast, but have had the homemade Quiche once or twice for lunch. They offer a daily Quiche that changes from day to day, but I have never been disappointed with the choice.    Highly recommend for breakfast or lunch. They are only open for breakfast or lunch hours. They are only open on week days."}
{"text":"Apollo Cafe is the perfect little downtown lunch spot!  Tons of delicious choices, and you can tell that everything is made fresh, with care.  The soup menu is always good and very filling, a meal in itself as the menu claims!  You can't go wrong with the cup of soup and 1/2 cold sandwich special either.  The only thing I don't like at Apollo is the hummus, but everyting else I've had over the years has been perfect.  I've never had breakfast here but I've heard it's good and should probably try it soon.  Also worth noting, the people that work there are very friendly and helpful if you have a question.  They are a little hurried, as someone said in a previous review, but it's understandable because they get busy!"}
{"text":"Best place to get a Greek salad in town! Really fast service and giant portions for a fair price. Their homemade vinaigrette is outstanding! I go here for lunch all the time."}
{"text":"I heard that the Apollo Cafe had good soups; plus they are close to my office. I opted for the broccoli cheese soup...which was excellent. However I thought that they might have more Greek food on their menu. Not really. I opted to get the quiche (spinach, tomato, feta) as well. It was not bad, but I don't think it was worth the $5.25 that I paid for it (would have been happier with a bowl vs. a cup of the soup!). With a drink, everything came to more than $11...which isn't expensive....but isn't cheap enough for me to go every day either. Plus it's small inside and gets really crowded really quickly.  Overall I was very pleased with the quality of the food. Marginally pleased with the price and atmosphere. I highly recommend the soup...but get it to go!"}
{"text":"Over priced sandwiches and the one lady working stated that she would put a $100 saying the Trump will be shot before his term is up. Very inappropriate talk for a restaurant that was full of customers."}
{"text":"This little CASH ONLY lunch spot beside Macy's makes some great, great stuff.  They have a daily quiche and about 4 different soups, usually half of these are vegetarian along with a pretty large menu of sandwiches and salads.  I don't think I've ever had a meal here I didn't absolutely love. I usually have either a small spinach salad (with their dill dressing, yum!) and a bowl of soup or a side of hummus w/pita and soup.    So here's the few reasons I can't give the place 5 stars...    1.  It's a very small, cramped cafe.  The tables are tiny, very close together and when the line goes out the door you may have people in line hovering over you while you eat, depending on where you park yourself.   2.  The ladies who work there are NO-NONSENSE.  Figure out what you want before you get to the front of the line or you will be glared at.  They want to get you your grub and keep the line moving so there is no time for smiling or humoring someone indecisive.    3.  The place gets filled with grill smoke when they are going full-bore at lunchtime.  Maybe it's time for a new exhaust fan...  Bottom Line: Excellent homemade food & a great selection of it.  But have your mind made up and your cash ready!!!"}
{"text":"O.K. So I have my own health scale. Raw Vegan would be at the top followed by Real Fresh Food.  In the middle of my scale is Gym Rat.  I'd place the University of Phoenix Cafe between Gym Rat and Real Fresh Food. Why? Because that's the kind of food they offer.  So if you're looking for raw vegan, you're out of luck. However, if you're looking for sometimes fresh and sometimes vitamins produced in a lab..this is your place.  No value statement here. The food tastes good, its not that loud, and you can walk in whether you have anything to do with U of Px or not.   Make the trip and enjoy the experience. P.S. They have fresh sushi!"}
{"text":"I love their bean & vegetable soup as well as the broccoli & cheese soup! :)"}
{"text":"Great soups, piping hot and reasonably priced.  Good salads and pie too, not the easiest setup to order and pay though."}
{"text":"This is a more than decent place downtown to grab a bite that I happened upon. I had a ham and cheese omelet here prior to a job interview last week, and it was quite good. Their menu leans heavily towards Greek, Arabic, and vegetarian fare. Recommended."}
{"text":"Meh, sad that this is one of the better options on this side of downtown.  Decent selection of salads, hummus, and tabouleh but nothing to get really excited about.  Prices seem fair but portions sometimes leave a bit to be desired."}
{"text":"It's neither here nor there.  Bottom line - it's sustenance for your body.  I had the chicken noodle soup and it was \"A-OK\", not great, not even that good, but it did the job - made me full.  It was inexpensive which was a positive.  I think a bowl of soup costs $3.10.    The one thing I will mention is that it definitely seemed homemade in that there was shredded chicken instead of cubed chicken pieces that are sponge-like and marginally taste like chicken.  There were also carrots, spinach, and onions - and of course noodles.  So while I was not overly impressed or dramatically disappointed, I did feel like it's a healthier option than some of these other lunch joints dahntahn."}
{"text":"I think this is a fantastic small place for lunch.  The food is basic but good and homemade.  The price is right for an appropriate size for lunch. I got the homemade basil and tomato soup and a half sandwich for $5.  It was the perfect size without feeling completely full.  The salad is also pretty good.    There's so many fast food joints in downtown Pittsburgh...Apollo Cafe is quite refreshing for a lunch option. I will keep coming back here."}
{"text":"I'm not exactly sure how Americans can distinguish between American restaurants. Like how do you tell the different between greases used?  Anyway, despite the name Apollo, it has nothing to do with Greek food here. Sure, they serve a Gyro sandwich and salad, but then again, who doesn't these days? I could damn near go to Starbucks for one.  So, I had a steak burger with cheese. I guess the new fashionable trend is to call items by fancy names because what they were serving was, well, hamburger. There is in fact a difference between hamburger and steak! It tasted fine, but then again it is really hard to f-up a hamburger (this is one of the reasons why I ordered it too). It came with chips that had the appearance of lay's ruffles. The total price with tax was $5.08, not a bad deal.  So, looking at my dining companions meals, about all I saw was fried grease. A Reuben, and a  chicken melt. The foreigner seemed pretty excited about his greasy sandwich. Maybe it's just me.  *this place is cash only*  Food Quality/Taste = 2 Stars Portion Size Given Price = 2 Stars Price = 3 Stars Service = N/A Experience with Staff = 2 Stars Decor = 3 Stars"}
{"text":"Used to be much better. A little pricey but if you order the daily specials the price is good. There is a good variety here and the salad bar has a lot of options."}
{"text":"I know this is weird that I am writing about a cafe at University of Phoenix, but this place is amazing.  UPX has a couple of cafes...one that is next door to my office, which I can't even think about reviewing because I am not thrilled with it and I find it odd that you get a grilled cheese with fries for $7.    If you drive the I-10, you have noticed the new buildings that UPX has built.  Well, inside one of those building is the most amazing cafe that any office can offer.  I mean they have Executive Head Chef's making amazing dishes.  And there are like all of these different food stations...and you can get a grilled cheese and fries for $4 instead.  And if you want, you can have prime rib for lunch, or amazing salads, or any of their specials of day.  For a reasonable price.  You feel like you are going to an upscale Golden Corral....but tastes so much better.  Amazing....I just wished I worked in one of those buildings so I can go there more often."}
{"text":"Apollo cafe is a go to for me during the week. Two Greek sisters just doing classic hot and cold lunches with a Greek twist.   Each day they have a variety of soups with a featured soup almost daily. I personally love to go on Thursday for their lemon chicken which is delicious. You can't beat their soup and sandwich combo which comes to like $6.37 or so, or switch it up and get soup and salad. Anyway it goes you get a nice meal for a decent price.  They have a nice menu and the food is fresh. If your downtown and looking for something quick and delicious this place has something for everyone."}
{"text":"The Apollo Cafe is an adorable little cafe underneath my office downtown. Service is always quick (sometimes a little too fast...hurried). They offer soups, sandwiches, salads, delicious sides, and even breakfast. I have had their sandwiches and sides. They have the best coleslaw I've ever had (asian chicken slaw with almonds). They only accept cash, which can be annoying, but I just have to remember to carry cash when I go. Pricing seems fair. You get a ton of food for the price of one side. You can even order a half cold cut sandwich (excluding the Apollo Club).  The sides do not skimp on the good ingredients. For instance, they have a cucumber, parsley, and tomato salad with some kind of dressing (maybe Greek?), and feta. There is always PLENTY of feta cheese, which I find can be a problem at other places (usually not enough).  It is clear that their food is homemade. I love that. It really is the perfect place to go when I am in need of a midday snack!"}
{"text":"First of all, I ordered the vegetarian chili, and it was WAY TOO HOT!  It was literally steaming!  Then I was steaming...MAD.  Also, portions are much too large.  I had to leave work early I was so full.  NOT RECOMMENDED unless you like endless vats of scalding chili!"}
{"text":"I went there for lunch and had the Apollo club. The breadworks bread was really good but they put only 2 slices of turkey and 2 slices of ham along with lettuce and tomato. It also came with a handful of store bought potato chips. The only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 was the bread was fresh and really good. Don't waste your money on this place."}
{"text":"Food is much healthier than it used to be.  Since I work in the area and am here often, the variety seems null. However, they have specials sometimes that are really good. You can get a decent lunch her for under $6."}
{"text":"Great, fresh Mediterranean Food!  Loved the grape leaves and the hummus. Tina was so friendly!  A plus is that they incorporate sustainability into their practices."}
{"text":"Love stopping by in the morning! Friends...food...good times...all at work!? What beats that!?"}
