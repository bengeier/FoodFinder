{"text":"Excellent restaurant. Great food, excellent cocktail list (Vesper Martini is a must) and a fun and inviting ambience."}
{"text":"Awesome place!!!! Great ambiance, amazing food, good service. They let us stay a long while to study and no one bothered us!!! I highly recommend it for a sunday afternoon lunch."}
{"text":"I was visiting my sister for the weekend when we came across this sophisticated restaurant in Montreal's Mile End. The food was very high quality for the price. We were served a large portion of soft herbed focaccia bread accompanied by olive oil and balsamic vinegar. We each ordered salads for main course: she had the goat cheese, beet, spinach, shallot and walnut salad and I went for one with tilapia, green beans, chickpeas, new potatoes, walnuts and watercress.   Our waiter was friendly and attentive. Since we're both students we chose the cheapest white wine and he didn't react with any snobbishness or disdain. The food came quickly and was very filling.  I would recommend this place to anyone looking for an affordable yet elegant meal."}
{"text":"Pour ceux qui, comme moi, ne sont pas trop fan de bistro, Voro vous laissera agéablement surpris. L'ambiance sombre et intimiste en fait l'endroit parfait pour un souper entre ami ou un tête-à-tête. Coté menu, y'a pas l'embarras du choix, c,est selon les goûts du chef. Par contre, quand il est inspiré, on en redemande.  Charmant bistro."}
{"text":"GREAT little spot. After breaking the bank at several other locales across the city this one was a hit! A good friend of mine suggested after I put forth my suggestions (cheap, good, nearby) she came back with 3 options. This one seemed the best and a reso was made.   Our gang of 5 was busily sipping wine at a friends place nearby and so we decided to call and push the reso by 30min. Considering how busy places get on a friday night I was surprised it was not a problem. When we arrived, we were pleasantly greeted and showed to our table. I liked that Voro also has a communal table although it is a bit wide...2 people sitting across from each other would have a hard time having a convo given the distance, other people and music.   We had 2 bottles of wine, an appi and entree each...all delicious (stuff calamari and chicken tagine were both delicious!) and at the end of the night the bill was about $40 each! WHOA!! About half the price than what we paid at Le Bremner although we were much less boozy.   They did have a really great looking cocktail list but given my imminent 5am wake up call for a flight back out west and knowing full well we were going to be dipping into the mezcal later anyway, we didn't really see the point in excessive boozy mixing. Ah maturity!!! Sometimes you are wise.   Would definitely recommend this spot."}
{"text":"Oh corner of Jeanne-Mance and Fairmount, you've housed many restaurants! The latest is Voro, and so far, it's had a much better run than its precursors.  The space is modern with some rustic touches. Actually it reflects the food, surnamed \"rustic Mediterranean\" by the chef - it's essentially a modern take on traditional ideas and dishes from all countries that border the Mediterranean (plus a few token American recipes thrown into the mix). The menu is impressively inexpensive, especially for a place that's been a major source of Mile-End buzz.  We started with a bottle of wine; it was both good and very decently priced. The homemade foccacia followed. Verdict? Fresh, spongy and delicious, especially with the accompanying olive oil.  We ordered three dishes. First came the salted cod and tomatoes with olives, capers and fresh dill ($7) and the grilled calamari stuffed with Phoenician rice, chorizo, and olives with a yoghurt sauce on the side ($8). Meh. Times two. I realize that \"salted cod\" is the big dry fish in Portuguese grocery stores that's so salted that it doesn't even need to be refrigerated, but I also know that to become edible, it must be soaked in water for hours and hours. In any case, the fish was slightly tough and seriously \"salted\". I've never made it myself, but maybe it wasn't soaked for long enough? The fish was just ok but the tomato sauce was good.  Next I had the calamari. It was ok, but nothing special. And actually, the fact that it was stuffed with rice was awkward. Why not just lay a nice piece of grilled calamari on some nice rice? That's what I ended up doing - de-stuffing my stuffed calamari - and I enjoyed it a lot more. In the end, it was good.  We also had the grilled cheese with Camembert and BBQ sauce on the side ($5). When you think of grilled cheese, what comes to mind? A decadent ooey-gooey cheesy sandwich that's too good to be left in your childhood memories. However, this grilled cheese was made with the homemade foccacia, which, while delicious, is much too thick for sandwich making purposes. Inside? A half-melted piece of Camembert with a slather of Dijon mustard. Sad face.  Finally, we ordered the chocolate mousse. Whoa boy, it was watery and excessively sweet. The chocolate mousse was not ok. Un point, c'est tout.  In all, the space wows and the atmosphere is great, but the food just doesn't live up to the rest of the package. Or, maybe it was the dishes I chose? Don't know. But, despite the slightly amateur-ish cooking, the place is very affordable, fun, and has an upbeat atmosphere. Instead of dinner, I would suggest a cocktail or glass of wine with a nice cheese plate to nibble on. And here's something to remember - the lighting is perfect for a date. Slightly dimmed, it creates a warm effect and makes everyone ridiculously good-looking.   Food 6.5/10, Atmosphere 9/10, Pretty people 8.5/10, Music (funmixofoldandnew) 8.5/10, Service 7/10.

{"text":"Amazing ambience, cocktails and brunch! Favorites are the Strawberry Lemonade cocktail, the French Toast for brunch and the Chicken Tagine for dinner. Located in the heart of Mile End on Fairmount. Great terrasse in summer."}
{"text":"This place is definitely one of the Northern Plateau dining gems. Beautiful open space, very reasonable/great prices, and delicious food.   Had the salmon and lentils and the stuffed calamari. so good.  looking forward to next time."}
{"text":"A restaurant that does it all. Breakfast, Lunch, Brunch, Dinner, Cocktails  Summer Terrace and a nice upscale decor inside.  Food is very well executed as is the service. Prices are very cheap considering the quality, the attention to detail and ingredients.  It is a bit Hipster-y, just a tad though"}
{"text":"The staff here are what make this restaurant 5 stars.  Extremely warm, friendly and thoughtful.  Example: an appetizer of kefta comes with 3 pieces.  Upon delivery there were four meatballs.  Minor point but realizing that two dudes not of the Brokeback persuasion wouldn't be down with Lady & the Tramp spaghetti kiss action, that was thoughtful.  Each time we interacted with our waitress she was kind, patient, warm and charming.  I wanted to hug her at the end of the evening.  Points for improvement: - time to serve main course, could be shortened.  But the focaccia tides one over very well.  The house made focaccia bread served warm in a cloth lined bucket, along with olive oil and balsamic, was moist and awesome.  The best I've had texture wise and perhaps ever.  The resto is open late.  M-Th kitchen closes at 11 and resto closes when people have left.  Fri/Sat, kitchen stays open till 1am and resto closes at 3am.  Location is quiet (which is awesome), dark, and decor is minimal and modern.  Picnic tables set up along rue Jeanne-Mance are great for summer outdoor dining with just enough light from street lamps and table candles.  Café style 2 person tables along Av. Fairmount can be put together to make bigger tables.  I'll definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Hello lovely neighbourhood spot. On my most recent visit to Montreal I had the good fortune to visit Voro on two occasions. Between sips of prosecco and roses, I dined in the company of good people and delicious morsels of food.   Delicious and memorable mentions: pickled beet salad, gravlax and stuffed eggplant with onion confit.   Better luck next time: potato latkes. I'm pretty sure my homemade latkes and can take yours in a schoolyard fight.   What I love most about Voro is the real neighbourhood feel. Staff mingling with patrons, chatting like old friends. That's the kind of place I like to call home."}
{"text":"Hello Voro. Cool mood lighting. Way to set the tone. But it was unmatched by the shrieking French man who felt the need to clap, sing at max volume and bang on the table. Who knew we were also getting entertainment! It was not a flash mob. Even the servers didn't know what to do! So I continued eating my kale and lentil salad. I know, girl choice! I just care about health like that. It was delicious, a bit spicy. My partner had the pulled short rib burger. Verdict: \"Can you say it was OK but not incredible and they are also using the words 'patatas bravas' WRONG.\" Basically - we were wronged. But here's to hoping another visit, sans loud Frenchie, will do us right."}
{"text":"Visiting from Vancouver where food is great, we just ate here for lunch.  We had the fennel-potato latkes with gravlax and a dish of chevre with dill and caper berries, and the french toast with smoked bacon and chicken topped with spinach and lovely sauce.  Both came with delicious grape tomatoes and roasted potatoes.  This was likely one of the best, most unique, and tasty brunches I have ever had.  Aside from being unique, the food quality was excellent with an incredible mix of flavours.  The service was also great.  Fluent in French and English, pleasant, and helpful (what is a caper berry?!).  I can't wait to be back in Montreal and eat there again - I want to try it for dinner!"}
{"text":"Le brunch est mon repas favoris. Je suis par contre très simple dans mon choix, je termine souvent avec les deux ufs tournés, saucisses, patates. Voro n'a rien de simple. Le menu est différent. J'ai pris la frittata bacon, oignons rouge et patates douces, avec un à-côté de latkes, ces fameuses galettes de pommes de terre, oignon et ail. Tout était très goûteux, sur l'assiette un filet de sauce crémeuse à l'aneth et une autre petite sauce très épicée. Les galettes étaient délicieuses. Le mimosa.... 5$!!! Le service, sympa et courtois!!!! et pour couronner le tout une petite gâterie sur le bras du resto, un morceau de pain foccacia à la cannelle. Grande amatrice de cannelle juste ici... ils sont tombés sur la bonne personne... c'était un pur DÉLICE. je donne rarement des 5*, c'est un de mes meilleurs brunch à vie, délicieux, du café américano jusqu'à la gâterie de départ en passant par la facture. À refaire sans faute!!!! profitez de la terrasse lorsqu'il fait beau!!!"}
{"text":"I heard this place was cool before but something happened to it. We went there for brunch. The menu was really weird , it had like 4 salads and 4 sandwiches on it nothing else, even if on their website they have listed quite a nice selection of plates for brunch. The service was extremely ..bad. The waiter mistaken the orders ,then took a lifetime to bring them to the table, then he forgot a part of the items even if like i said there were like 8 items in total on the menu :))  we ate after more than one hour after getting there. They couln't even serve what they had on the 5 cocktails menu list , they either had no Baileys , or no fresh mint or no Bourbon or etc.  After trying to get like 3 different cocktails from the menu with no success he asked us if we want wine.... lol? NO! Anyway the salad i ordered included some few tomatoes with a bit (3 small pieces) of cheese and some not baked \"croutons\" = $10 salad Say what? Sounds like a ripoff kind of business and that waiter can gain a prize for the worst waiter of the year ...no tip for you..not coming back there"}
{"text":"Delicious brunch menu. Around 9-15$ range. Great ambience. I didn't give five stars because service was really slow.   I had the Italian sausage sandwich and buttermilk biscuits starter with steak butter and blueberry jam. The biscuits are awesome and you get 3 big ones for 6$. Very worth it !"}
{"text":"Since Lawrence was closed for holiday, we found Voro by chance for brunch.  We sat at the bar, and had excellent service from the bartender.  My vegetarian frittata was delicious and packed with lots of veggies. I ordered a side of chorizo and it was good, not the ground type that I expected like I find in NY Mexican restaurants.   No drip coffee here. Their cappuccino was good, and espresso better.  Free wifi. Their bloody Mary with clam juice was delicious. I forget the name of it. Check it out."}
{"text":"I love the decor and ambiance of Voro. It's totally what I wish my apartment would look like if I could afford it. I went there on a Sunday late afternoon for a quick bite to eat and could totally hang out there for hours and hours. I like how the tables are well spaced out so you don't have to worry about people eavesdropping while you dish out the dirtiest gossip to your friend. The menu is totally what you'd expect from a restaurant that looks like that: everything seemed to have an air of 'je ne sais quoi' about it. Even if you'll end up with basically chicken salad, alfalfa and chopped onions tucked in between crusty panini bread. It was quite yum, though if I were to go back there, it was so that I could benefit from the place, instead of the cuisine. My nearly vegetarian friend ordered the aubergines rôties from the lunch au brunch menu and she thought it was quite the culinary delight. The only thing I was kinda wondering about was that we didn't get a drinks menu at all. Not sure if our waitress simply forgot to bring one over or none exists!"}
{"text":"Sorry to hate guys, but this restaurant shan't be getting a penny of my business.  It seemed like a nice little location to check out since a) it's been open a few years so it isn't just some flash-in-the-pan sort of doomed location and b) the interior looks nice enough.  Big wood dining table?  Great!  I'm in...and sitting down at said giant slab of lumber ready to have a nice little meal and a beer.  Oh what's that?  Some dude jamming loud boring house music from his laptop now?  Alright....that's a sidetrack and doesn't accurately reflect the restaurants' service or kitchen.    ANYWAY, the \"server\" made sure to go and check up on said dude with laptop twice before even noticing me and my other potential client with our menus towards the edge of the table so as to say \"hey, inattentive person attempting to work in a public service position, take our order please.\"  We ordered a beer each (no good local stuff, wtf?) and moved ourselves away from the sweet yet loud table.  After moving over to the antipode of the restaurant, we meandered through the menu and made a couple of choices to sample this supposedly good restaurant.  The server came over and promptly informed us that our choices were unavailable.  Now, I'm mostly a cook and have some serving experience, but even if you're in the Mile End and the majority of the clientèle in your restaurant are young folk with disposable income and no taste, it's just common knowledge that when you can't serve an item since it isn't available you preface whatever you say with \"I'm sorry.\"  MAYBE this server was about to quit or going through some sort of life-altering horrible endeavour, but in any case it was enough to make me and my date get up and go somewhere else.  In closing, the cuisine may be lovely, but if the service is crap, one can never really know."}
