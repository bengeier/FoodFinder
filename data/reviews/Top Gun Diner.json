{"text":"This has to be the most mediocre diner in the area. The service was unbelievably SLOW and just all around bad. The food was quite ordinary and I couldn't believe it when I was served a cold canned biscuit. I will definitely not be returning."}
{"text":"Excellent food (try the oatmeal with bruleed bananas), staff is attentive, owner is a hoot!  Have we had to wait a bit for our food?  Yes...have we gotten there on a Sunday morning when church-goers are there and it's packed?  Yes.  But still, the food is consistently prepared well with great flavor.  Excellent place to go, read the Sunday paper and relax with a good meal!"}
{"text":"Truely I have been on a life long search for the perfect burger.  This is one of the closest I have ever come. I had a 1/2 lb burger coated in Panko deep fried to MRare.  Pepper jack cheese melted on to with torch topped with house made \"kamakzi\" mayo (awesome, drown me in a bucket of it please). I couldn't get my mouth square around the thing. So juicy so yummy.  I will still search but this is now the burger to beat!"}
