{"text":"Some friends and I tried Skinny Pete's out today.  We tried the muffulleta, the cuban, and the Evil Mr Pork Chop.  All three were really good, but the muffulleta and the cuban stood out the most.  The bread always makes or breaks a sandwich for me, and the ciabatta on the muffulleta was great.    We all had the pasta salad as a side, and all of us liked it.  Overall, a nice edition to the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Tried the lunch offerings at my most recent visit. Very tasty flatbread with generous toppings of fresh ingredients- I will definitely try additional varieties on return visits.  The star of my meal was the tomato basil bisque. Holy delicious! Creamy, bits of fresh basil, the big croutons soaked up the soup and added a delicious flavor and texture. And of course, the always friendly, efficient service."}
{"text":"3 stars instead of 2 because the lady who brought our food out was extremely nice and welcoming. The main hostess/server just did not want to be there that day, and it was pretty obvious. The food: we went for Saturday brunch, and I was beyond excited. However, my omelet was burnt and watery. Not enjoyable to eat, but I was hungry so I did anyway. I just picked out the artichokes and red peppers and at them separately from the burnt egg and watery gorgonzola. The veggies were good!  I still want to go back and try their flatbreads and pizzas, but I will not be going back for brunch. Why would you serve a burnt omelet? After we left, I was talking about how disappointed I was, and then realized I should have asked them to re-make it. But you always risk getting more in your food than you ordered when you do that, so maybe it's best I just suffered in silence."}
{"text":"So, my husband I went back to Skinny Pete's Kitchen for brunch today and it was amazing! I had the breakfast burrito. The presentation alone was enough to impress, but the taste made it even better.  I predict that we'll be going here a lot."}
{"text":"Really good and reasonably priced breakfast. Egg sandwich comes with a nice side of fresh fruit. Side of home fries $1. Clean and friendly, too."}
{"text":"Once again ive come here and im in love with their specials.  Plus their  regular menu is AMAZING!!!!"}
{"text":"All I can really say is that I can't wait to go back. I've had breakfast once and brunch once and, each time, I was extremely happy with every facet of the place. The food is delicious. They have unique items and homestyle favorites, and wonderful specials. The service makes you feel like a welcome old friend, and the place just has a happy vibe to it. I will definitely be supporting this business and contributing to what I hope will be a smashing success in the Pittsburgh restaurant scene."}
{"text":"I really like this place. I first heard of them from the Pittsburgh Restaurant Week kickoff party. The place itself is pretty small, and it seems like everything they cook is cooked in the pizza oven, which is fine by me. I had the cheese plate and Sarah S. had a flatbread. Both were awesome. I have one gripe here though. I can not find the same hours of operation listed on more than one document. I have 3 takeout menus and the website and they ALL have different hours, which led to me going there 3 times when they were closed... Super frustrating!!"}
{"text":"We have been to Skinny Pete's several times & have yet to be disappointed! The staff is so friendly & accommodating. The food is super fresh & flavorful. The menu offers a nice variety & there are always several daily specials. I have honestly loved everything I've ordered! Prices are reasonable & kids are welcome. Do yourself a favor and check this place out!"}
{"text":"Since I wrote my initial review Skinny Pete's have started dinner service and it's fantastic!  Tonight I had the special, skirt steak, beans and risotto.  It was really tasty, served with an egg on top all in one bowl.  Perfect comfort food for a chilly fall night.  One thing I love about SP's is that they have a wide range of prices for dinner, so you can get a pizza or mac and cheese for under $10, or you can spring for a special like I did, for $18.  Service is very good and I can't wait to see what their new menu includes.  Still highly recommend Skinny Pete's!"}
{"text":"You have no idea what your in for when you sit down for a meal at skinny Pete's. The menu is perfect, small and everything is incredible. No fill in items. I've eaten at every major food spot in this city. This place is it. Awesome service awesome food awesome prices. Get to skinny Pete's!"}
{"text":"Was in Avalon a little after 8:30 on a Monday morning, and had some time to kill  while my puppy was getting groomed. Was just going to run to Eat n Park, when i found this place on Yelp. Adorable and cozy, nice homey feel. Would much rather support local business, and not a huge fan of the EandP breakfast. It's in a more residential stretch of Cali Ave - not a lot of foot traffic I'm afraid.  Found myself the only one there. Had some good coffee and an omelette with cheese, mushrooms and tomatoes. Everything was nice and fresh, and the omelette was nicely browned - just how I like it. Had some sausage patties and Texas toast too.  There were several menu options, and they all sounded delish. Was chatting it up with one of the owners - very friendly, funny, down-to-earth - a great all-around personality!  Will recommend Pete's to my friends, and looking forward to stopping back."}
{"text":"What an awesome little place!  Rather than go to the same places that we always do, we opted to venture to Avalon and try Skinny Pete's for brunch.  I'm so glad we did.  The space is cute. Small, quaint and inviting.  It was packed when we got there, but thankfully there was a table for 2 right by the window.  We were greeted promptly and kindly, and were told we could have a seat there.  At a glance of the menu, I was not sure, did I want breakfast or lunch?  I opted for breakfast but also decided to try the Tomato Basil Bisque.  Everything was great.  My eggs were perfect, the hash browns were awesome, toast was perfectly done and the sausage and bacon was perfect too.  The soup was the best though.  I would go back just for that.  My husband got the Goat Cheese flatbread and it looked amazing.    I love how they use local purveyors and take great pride in it.  The two ladies working were attentive and super sweet.  Service wise, they were top notch!   Can't wait to go back to this awesome little place... Perhaps for dinner next time!!!"}
{"text":"Charming little restaurant with a delicious brunch menu. We had the chicken salad sandwich, pizza and breakfast burrito. Great food with good prices! We're from out of town but would definitely go back if in the area."}
{"text":"Yummmmo! Had Saturday brunch, breakfast burrito and pancake breakfast...both were excellent. Great prices, atmosphere, food, and service. Go, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"My new favorite place to grab a bite. Nice decor, good food, affordable prices."}
{"text":"I stopped by here yesterday with my father for lunch.  While I have never been to Skinny Pete's before I have tried their food on a number of different occasions at tastings and have always wanted to come here.  Whenever we made it inside the restaurant it did not look anything like I had expected it to as it looked like a coffee shop.  That's not to say that it was a bad thing, just not what expected.  Beyond that I was also able to see the brick oven that they have for cooking their flatbreads and pizzas.  For my lunch entree I decided on the mac and cheese which allowed you to choose three different mix-ins from a list of fifteen of which I choose avocado, turkey sausage and artichoke hearts.  I really don't know what I was thinking picking that weird combination of ingredients except that I enjoy all of them.  My dad ended up ordering the most expensive item on the menu which was the steak sandwich.  It came with a side which he did not want and so he allowed me to make a choice and I went with the soup du jour which that day was a broccoli cheese soup.  I started off with the broccoli cheese soup first.  It was a little thicker than I was expecting but still tasted good with a nice cheese flavor in it.  About midway through my soup the mac and cheese arrived at the table and I quickly abandoned the soup.  The cavatappi pasta used in the mac and cheese was the perfect noodle choose for the flavorful and gooey cheese sauce that was on top of it and I really enjoyed it, especially whenever I got some turkey sausage in a bite as well.  What I didn't really enjoy was my own doing in the avocado and artichoke hearts.  The creamy avocado with a creamy sauce was just not that smart of me while the sour artichoke against the savory cheese was once again a miss.  Oh well, you live and you learn.  I was also able to try a piece of steak from my fathers sandwich which ended up being both tender and flavorful.  Whenever I asked him about it he told me that he was enjoying it although it was a bit dry.  I then pointed out the cup of horseradish thyme mayonnaise the server had brought over but for some reason was not on his plate.  Judging from the amount he used on the rest of his sandwich that was a hit with him and made it taste a lot better.  The bottom line for me is that I would stop by here again in the future.  While it is not at the top of my list of places to visit again, my food was certainly good enough and I think I probably should have tried a flatbread or pizza with the oven that they have,"}
{"text":"There aren't too many great places for a casual dinner in this neighborhood, so I was very happy to try this place out.  The tomato bisque was delicious.  We split an order of \"skinny dippers\" (breadsticks) with queso and they were yummy. We also split a BBQ Chicken Skinny Bread (Flat Bread) which was big enough for two. Excellent food, reasonable prices, decent atmosphere (the chairs aren't very comfortable) and great service. We will be back."}
{"text":"This place deserves a review.    I heard through social media that this place was opening.  It is nestled in the business district of Avalon, a few miles from downtown Pittsburgh.  My kiddos were sick, so my wife and I  thought we would order and pick it up.  The person who answered the phone was courteous and very happy to speak with me.   I asked about the special.  The special for the day stuffed hot peppers which is not normally on the menu.  They said 15-20 minutes and that was spot on.  The cost was $16 for two orders.  It had two perfectly stuff hot peppers and toasted baguettes.  There was plenty of food. When we got it home, it was well decorated even in the to go container.  I am was impressed it was still warm.   The sauce was homemade and well balanced.  I was impressed with the whole package including the portioning.    It is rare that I rate a restaurant, but this place warranted a proper 5 stars for food, courteousness, and price.  Jonathan Bernstein"}
{"text":"LOVED THIS PLACE. Delicious food, nicest workers, and the decor was awesome. They also make a great cup of coffee which is rare for diners in this area. I can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"Not sure who Skinny Pete is but he mades a mean sandwich.  A small unique lunch and breakfast place.  Had some homemade tomato basil soup and a really tasty Cuban sandwich.   Menu items are kind of gourmet diner food.  There is a brick oven for pizza.  Will have to stop back and try that in the future.  The Menu has some interesting sandwiches (Pete-wiches) like the Muffulleta, Evil Mr Pork Chop, Roasted Captain Veggie or you can build your own.  Same idea with the Pizza  on handmade dough,  pick from a couple on the menu pizza or build your own that includes tofu or portabella.  Some Salads, Skinny bread for those that like flatbreads, and a couple pasta dishes.   Did not look at the breakfast menu but SP's does not open until 8 and closes at 3 M to F, so not sure if they will get many before work unless you work in Avalon or Bellevue.   Saturday hours are shorter, so do not go early.   Great artwork on the walls from a local artist.  Some fresh flowers on the tables, nice touch.  Service was freindly and very good."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have been to Skinny Pete's numerous times and will continue to support this local business. It is such a small, cute restaurant with a ton of art on the walls, which is available for sale. I'm not sure that this would be a good place to bring your kids as it has mostly small tables and limited seating. Each time we have gone to Skinny Pete's we have had a wonderful experience. We love the fact that it is BYOB. They have such a friendly wait staff, and always provide good service. We usually order the special of the night and are never disappointed! They also have very tasty flatbreads and a \"skinny dipper\" appetizer. I have not yet made it to Skinny Pete's for their brunch but im sure it's nothing short of amazing as others have said. This is just the kind of place Avalon needed!"}
{"text":"This place is so cute with a very friendly staff and fun art on display. The breakfast tasted like true home cooking with a unique spin to the flavor. Very good! I can't wait to try their lunch menu."}
{"text":"I really wanted to keep it skinny here yinz guyz. But ya know what? That make your own grilled cheese was a'callin' to me! So I took the bait!  One happy looking grilled cheese came out to me with my pick of horseradish cheddar cheese (HECK YEAH), tomato and caramelized onion. All were included in the deal. You could also add a spread (with many to choose from) but I thought the horsey flavor would be enough.  Sure was! It was ooey and gooey, and smart choice with the onions I might add (I'll pat myself on the back later). Comes with a side salad (or fruit or potato salad) that was a decent size. Loved the honey vinaigrette! Never had something like that before.  I think they're destined for great things, and I'm destined to be back!"}
{"text":"\"Honey I'm Home\" is a unique and delicious sandwich!  More sandwiches need Brie cheese!  I didn't even know about this place until a friend told me about it.  It's a 2 minute walk from my house!  I know exactly where I'm going now when I'm too lazy to make something at home.   A number of the other menu items looked good. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Mmmm amazeballs for brunch. Made a reservation to try out Skinny Pete's for brunch during Pittsburgh Restaurant Week, and ventured to Avalon.  Not as far away as I thought, about a 15 min drive from Lville.  SP is small, so reservations are def recommended. There isn't anywhere inside to wait for a table. If you come w/o a res, be prepared to wait outside.  Not open on Sundays, their brunch is on Saturdays.  Emphasis on local here. They serve La Prima coffee and almost every dish on the menu incorporates ingredients from the burgh. Our bacon pancakes featured bacon from the Allegheny City Smokehouse.  Both our server and the owner were very friendly. I love that the owner was out and about in the dining area, interacting with patrons (all with a huge smile on her face!)  And a Bring Your Own Vodka Bloody Mary Bar? Total genius! Plus free coffee with a Yelp check-in."}
