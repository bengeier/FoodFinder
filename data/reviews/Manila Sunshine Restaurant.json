{"text":"Delicious food!  Friendly staff!  Great value for your money!  I say GO FOR THE BUFFET! :)"}
{"text":"The restaurant is now a pizza joint.  I called to confirm there wasn't a new location & the phone was out of service... another one bites the dust. Too bad."}
{"text":"If it's homecooked filipino food you're looking for, this is the place.  It was refered to me by a friend.  It has that hole-in-the wall appeal, but isn't most good food in places like that.

The staff are friendly and greet you right away.  It's an almost everyday (closed obn Sundays) buffet of \"Kapampangan\" cuisine.  Mainstays like Dinuguan, Papaitan, Kare-kare and Abobo are favorites here.  These are complemented by a selection of Sinigangs, Paksiws and and sauteed veggies.  Short orders include breakfast plates of Tapa, Tocino, Logganisa or Tuyo with the usual Garlic Rice and Fried Eggs anyway you want it.  You might wait a while for them to prepare it, but it sure is worth the wait.  

It's a family owned restaurant and that's the feeling you get when you eat there, you're treated like family.  And that makes for good eating."}
