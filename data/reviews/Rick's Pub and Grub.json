{"text":"Food was delicious... Pork tacos and beans should be on the everyday menu! Service was great and happy hour prices open thru 7pm everyday!"}
{"text":"Went to Ricks Friday night with a friend....greeted immediately by bartender and another man while heading out to look at the massive patio (little did we know this is Rick himself)   
First impression: Excellent....super welcoming staff!

We started at the bar, drinks were great...Rick suggested his specialty pizza with a chipotle sauce, I asked if I could try if first....it was tasty!

Second impression:  great drinks and \"I like this place, the employees make me feel comfortable\"   ....love how the bartender kept an eye on our drinks and checked several times if we needed another, cool she never let us go empty.

Chicken chipotle pizza was great....thin crust...  We got more drinks and headed out to the patio to enjoy the sunset...

Nice experience, awesome neighborhood bar with many tvs, pool table and several patio games...

I will go back again."}
{"text":"We entered and spied a few Spartan tables and smaller TVs raised to absurd volume levels with sparsely populated walls containing nothing to absorb any sound which resulted in us being battered with a cacophony of football commentators and loudly conversing patrons. We stood in an area near the door for roughly three minutes and didn't observe a single waiter/waitress but did observe one bartender frantically trying to serve every customer seated at the bar. No one was eating any food supposedly served there.  No one spoke to us. We promptly exited and likely won't return. I'm always rather perplexed when proprietors open a bar and seem to want to make it fly by managing it on the cheap. Maybe it was a bad night but we were unimpressed. I'm betting this place is closed within a year."}
{"text":"The perfect neighborhood pub.  The food is excellent (have the patty melt!), and there are frequent drink specials and tasty cocktails.  Add in a friendly staff, plenty of games, a great jukebox, and a kid and dog friendly patio and you've got a great place celebrate, gather, or just have a family meal out.  Tip...you can't beat the $5 breakfast burrito with tots inside."}
{"text":"Have visited Ricks on several occasions to play billiards with my elderly father. The staff & maybe the owner (not sure) have been very nice & welcoming. We've eaten the food a few times. Cheeseburgers & fries, hot wings another time. Pretty good \"bar food\". Seems like they keep busy updating & making improvements. It's a nice little neighborhood bar."}
{"text":"Tried it for the first time. Sat at the bar. Had the chicken fingers, cheesy garlic bread and a sausage pizza. One of the best pizza's we have ever had. The appetizers were great too. Owner and bartender were very friendly."}
{"text":"Came for karaoke.... there were some really good singers! Chelsea (the kj) did a great job and the waitresses were very attentive.  Pretty big place with a nice patio out back. I'll be back, and bring more friends :)"}
{"text":"This used to be a pretty good place to get a burger. But my burger came rare when I asked for medium well. When I told the waitress that maybe she should write stuff down she attacked me for being rude. And this is after I got the wrong side as well. Such a bizarre experience because this was even after someone left their apron in the bathroom which I returned to the waitress but then she calls over 2 other employees (men...i had been in the ladies room)to discuss whose apron it was...ok?  We had been to Rick's a few times and the owner is nice. She is awesome with customers AND she writes down your order!!! But we're done now. Why go back?"}
{"text":"I give 2 stars for their nice patio. Pizza was poor quality & extremely over priced. My husband & I tasted the rubbery canned mushrooms with every bite. 1st pizza we chose not to finish. Wings were Ok. Needless to say- we will enjoy the beer & Patio only if ever we visit again."}
{"text":"We WILL be back. Great atmosphere,  not too loud, many drafts to choose from even a couple seasonal too!. Food was amazing, seriously. We don't go out often, but this was amazing. Pizza is a thin crust, East coast style,  Italian sub was the same, reminded me of my hometown. To.Die.For.bread, seriously folks. .great bread. It's a sports kind of bar, but with good food..more than just chicken wings and chicken strips, no offense to the wing and strip lovers...this place has been a few things, let's keep it going.. the owner is from Ohio..how cool!!!"}
{"text":"Best pizza I have had in a long time. The pizza sauce awesomeness great taste with a kick, damn good, new best pizza place in town."}
{"text":"Where do I start best patio in chandler the smoked wings are the best in town, beer prices and liquor prices are amazing.  Not to mention the new ownership is awesome check it out if not your missing out. P.S industry night every night 20% off"}
{"text":"ricks was perfect for an evening nba game with my young daughter. good kids menu, good beers, great service, valerie was friendly and attentive.

i will go back again,
brandon"}
{"text":"There onion rings are extremely delicious! And the Karaoke is nice and a very fun environment! Great TVs for watching live sports and event."}
{"text":"We just moved into the neighborhood and really hoping to find a great local place for good food with a nice atmosphere. We found exactly that in Rick's! The burgers were incredibly juicy on a brioche bun, super tasty onion rings.. and cold beer! Service was superb, we didn't want for anything.. we will be back! Give it a try, you won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"I love this place! Been there a few times. It's open, not crowded, and the employees are very kind. Oh and the patio is really nice!!! Also you can't beat $3 bloodys and mimosas on the weekends!"}
{"text":"Great local spot for pizza and beer. The owner and staff are really friendly, like Midwest friendly. And hello!  The pizza is delicious. We really loved the crispy pepperonis on the thin crust. They have a full bar and the selection of local beers is pretty good (Kiltlifter, Devil's ale, and Huss blond) And if you're an Ohio sports fan, this is your place because the owner and staff hail from the Buckeye state. Dining al Fresca? They have it! I love a patio when the weather is nice and their patio sports corn hole, ping pong, and giant Jenga!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service. Hailey remembered my grandson and the fact we were here for his birthday. And she even remembered what he was drinking.  She is awesome. The food is always good and you won't go hungry.  They have great beer on tap.  Food is reasonably priced. Love the happy hour."}
{"text":"This location is CURSED!! I'm not sure if the last three previous owners, and now Rick get such a good deal on the lease for a year or two that they just say screw it and try a restaurant/bar out. The menu here at Ricks is limited, and the food is below mediocre! I had the pepperoni pizza and it was nothing but grease, and the crust is HORRIBLE!!  It is ALWAYS dead in there with almost two, maybe tree people at a time in there unless you go on a fri, or sat there might be seven or eight people. Maybe it's due to their beer prices! I ordered two small Lagunita IPA BEERS and it was $11... Seriously, $5.50 a beer for a place that probably won't be open a year from now... Rick, go a mile west down to Jerseys, or Teakwoods and take notes!! Nobody wants to pay $5.50 for a beer unless it's 32oz. SAVE YOUR TIME AND MONEY PEOPLE!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I came in here for round two since the drinks specials were great the last time we were here and we decided food was in the equation for tonight. We had the wings (smoked and baked) and a burger. Hands down some, if not, of the best wings I have ever had in my life. Juicy and plump is all a girl needs in her wings! Also the sauce lended itself perfect to the smokey flavor of the wings (ps the burger was amazing too). Valerie, the bartender, was a comedic relief after the long day and was more than accommodating with any request... and kept the drinks coming!"}
{"text":"Ricks is the BEST!!!!!  I highly recommend it its like \"Cheers\" where everybody knows your name.....Rick is amazing and Valerie is the best bartender ever!!!!! She remembered my drink and name after the first visit! Great food too! Go to Ricks you won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"Super friendly. Cold beer, great peeps & the service with much charm & character  . Fun, fun, fun!!"}
{"text":"A clean Bar & Grill with open space to watch a game and have a beer while enjoying some good, heat laden wings. Had a chance to talk to the owner and he has a good thing in the making.  Glad to see their craft beer selection will be expanding and you can't go wrong when you hear that habanero is used in the hot wing sauce. I look forward to coming back and ordering a North Coast Crazy Bitch Double IPA. Support local familes and businesses like Rick's Pub & Grill!"}
{"text":"No. Just No. I was in from out of town and my friends do karaoke so I went to meet them. It took over 30 minutes from the bartender who was on her phone behind the bar to even realize I had walked in. There was less than 20 people in the whole bar so it's not like I was lost in the crowd. I sang a song in karaoke and sat back down and it was another 5 minutes before she came over to check on the table and noticed I was there. Then it took 14 minutes to bring me my drink. If it had been alcohol it would have melted most of the ice and been terribly watered down. Thankfully I only got lemonade. I had decided three different times what I wanted to eat, seriously, staring at a menu that long makes you change your mind! I sung another song then finally got to eat. I asked for a water I never received, sang one last song and then went to the bar to be ignored for a minute, while she was finishing up story time, paid my tab and left. I was there for 2.5 hours saw my server bartender 3x and again never got my water. Nope. When I go back to visit friends and family I will not be going to Ricks. Sorry karaoke friends I love you and I love karaoke but when service beyond sucks somewhere I will not go. I have boycotted another bar for the same reason."}
{"text":"I took some coworkers here for drinks and a bite to eat after work.  The place was clean, had a lot of tvs and nice decor.  The beer menu was limited.   They had about 8 beers on tap.  The food is very basic bar food.  The pizza is a pre-made cardboard crust with toppings added, while the wings were pretty average.  Rick came out to say hi.  He seemed like a nice guy.  The waitress did her job but didn't have much to say.   It was pretty empty...about 6 other people there.   Not sure where the other reviews were manufactured.   This is certainly not a 5 star place."}
{"text":"The pizza, subs and atmosphere st Rick's was great. They welcomed us with done amazing Garlic Cheese bread and the pizza and subs were amazingly good. Check out Rick's for you next night out."}
{"text":"10 TV's all brand new, awesome bartenders and servers, excellent food and cheap well made drinks!  Monday-Friday Happy Hour from 3-6 $2 drafts $2 well drinks! Plus 25% off your apps.

You must absolutely try the pizza here! 

Its a new unknown spot so get in to be a local before your chair is taken!"}
{"text":"Just got done having a wonderful lunch! Nice lunch specials and options! Would come back to watch football or sporting event. Talked to the owner and she was very nice and the service and food was great!!"}
{"text":"Not bad. People were having conversations with other people and not staring at their phones. An enjoyable time. Food and apps were good. Service was great for the bartender being the only employee other than the kitchen staff. No complaints."}
{"text":"One word....hospitable.
Rick was such a nice guy to meet. Good beers on tap and the pizza is great.
He sat down and talked to us for a while, telling us about his restaurants he owned and the the future for his new place.
I wish him the best of luck."}
{"text":"3 stars because my wife liked her Patty Melt. Onion rings were good. Happy hour $2 beers were good. Wings were not good at all. Ordered hot wings and asked for them to be fried crispy. Not hot at all and definitely not crispy. I think they sat in the window quite a while before they served them. My wife was halfway through her meal when my wings arrived and were barely warm. Ate half threw away other half. $10 for 8 wings. Not a good value. Server made a price adjustment and apologized. They seem to be trying. Will try this place again later on. Hopefully with better results."}
{"text":"Best kept secret for a year!  We stumbled across this hidden gem on our way to a different bar.  What great wine prices. Happy hour everyday. Food menu looks good... We will be back for sure!!! Nice and fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"This is definitely my favorite place to be! There  has yet to be something on the menu that I didn't like. The smoked fried wings are the best I have had. Plus, can't beat their great drink specials including the daily beat the clock that starts off their nights at 8 pm. The patio is massive with ping pong, corn hole, and  giant jinga. When it's too hot out, there is darts and pool inside. The staff and service is also top notch! You gotta try it!"}
{"text":"Good beer and wings, very efficient bar tenders/servers.  Nice neighborhood bar.  We had smoked, extra crispy hot wings and fries, with hellu hot sauce on the side.  The smoke flavor was intense and the wings were really crisp."}
{"text":"I went there for the first time last night with a large group. Not only was the manager super attentive but he passed us off to one of the coolest bartenders after he left. It's dark in there, doesn't maybe feel like a place you want to go during day, but it's pretty rad. The DJ that was there M97, was awesome and would play just about anything you could ever ask for! I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"The burgers are really good.  The light crispy beer battered onion rings are the best I have ever had.  My friend said her fries were fantastic.  Terrific $5.00 lunch with burger/fries and a soda.  Can't beat the quality for that price.  
They should keep the doors shut though so the flies don't come inside and pester while you try to eat. 

Terrific food."}
{"text":"We Iove Ricks! Great Pizza! Great Happy Hour! $2.00 domestic pints 3-6 M-F. RIcks is a very friendly guy, great neighborhood bar."}
{"text":"DONT BOTHER. My husband and I walked in for the first time....no one greeted us for five minutes so we seated ourselves...still nothing. We walked up to the bar and the girl with half a shaved head tells us \"Here are your menus\", then didn't seat us!!!! She then became angry when we said we wanted to sit outside and said \"I am the only one here and I really busy.\" 
There were empty tables with old glasses everywhere! They were never cleared!!!! We said thanks anyways and left! NEVER AGAIN!!! When the reviews on here say the service SUCKS and is UNPROFESSIONAL and RIDICULOUS.... IT IS TRUE!!!! SO many other better places! Trust us!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Ally was by far the best attraction on a slow Tuesday night.  If the new management capitalizes on her skills the business will go far.  As we learned tonight the prices are fair for alcohol but we did not eat a meal so will not comment on food. It is a new  business and the  bartender expectations are high.  We are personally hoping for nightly drink and dinner menus so we can plan our week (taco Tuesday - wings Wednesday etc!).  These specials need to be visible on Ray and Rural roads otherwise no one will know where they are.
  Go Buckeyes Rick...we truly hope you can make it after watching 3 bars unsuccessful attempts in this location.  Our best hopes to you..."}
{"text":"I came in to ricks pub and grub. Tia the cook was amazing, served up some green Chile pork Mac and cheese that was incredible. Everyone at work loved . Tia and Elizabeth made my trip today wonderful , the best burrito EVER! Tia ( the cook) even came out to ask how I would like my burrito or if I would like more meat. Elizabeth the bartender, was happy and provided great service!!"}
{"text":"Their chicken quesadillas are amazing. I would definitely recommend. Very reasonable happy hour as well!"}
{"text":"Great Bar, Great Prices, Great Owners!  What's not to love?  Tons of TV's to get your sports fix too."}
{"text":"Nice clean pub with really good food. Wings are great and beer is cold off tap. The owners are very nice people and it's a fun place for kerokee"}
{"text":"The bartender sparked some attitude and was a bit  confrontational.  The drinks came when requested but as for overall customer service I'll rate it a 1 tops,  I expected more. Doubt I'll ever go back."}
{"text":"Great fkr what it is. Good priced food. Their drinks are also eztremely affordable. Everything is good and relatively cheap, they never seem overly busy, go support them!"}
{"text":"This was a cool place to get in a get a quick breakfast while my husband watched his football game."}
{"text":"An amazing place!!! This is a great neighborhood place let it be your favorite bar like it is mine!!!"}
{"text":"Under new ownership and the owners are amazing!!!  They are ready to update some things and willing to hear what their customers want!!!  Cold beer and good Burger!!! Huge patio. Cant wait for it to cool down."}
{"text":"The food is delicious here especially if Tia is working. You have to try the green pork chili it's to die for. Elizabeth was our bartender and she made us bomb drinks and gave us great service. And I even found out they have karaoke every night. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great local watering hole! Servers and bartenders are outstanding and the food is great and quick to the table. A must do around Ray & Rural."}
{"text":"We were looking for a meal after 9:30PM on a Sunday.  We stopped at other places that were closed even though their websites said they'd be open.  We found Rick's Pub & Grub on Yelp and we are really glad we did. 

The food was served quickly and hot off the grill, the proportions were generous and at reasonable prices. Best yet, everything was delicious.

We met Jessica, the new owner, she's really nice.  And she has fun plans for her new venture:  different specials each night of the week, games for fun on their huge, dog friendly, patio.

My grown sons and I are likely to be regulars. I'm so glad some of our regular spots let us down so we found Rick's Pub & Grub.

Family owned and operated, it's a great neighborhood bar

Check it out!"}
{"text":"Great bar, service was excellent. The atmosphere was awesome and the layout of the whole place was spacious and friendly. Most importantly their pepperoni pizza was great. they had the pepperonis that curl up and they load the pizza with them. Cold beer, good food, and great people (even if they are buckeye fans) what more could you ask for in life."}
{"text":"I was part of a very large group that descended upon Rick's this past Saturday evening for an \"after-party\" following a Raiders fan convention in Phoenix. 

Rick's is a very clean, spacious and welcoming establishment. I was very impressed with the physical appearance, set up and back patio. We arrived ahead of the majority of the over 200+ fans that planned to make their way to Rick's and were immediately greeted warmly and taken to our seats by a friendly waitress. The pub's namesake Rick kept the joint jumpin' that night and he was very nice and very accommodating. 

My lack of enthusiasm and three star rating is for the food. The menu is extremely limited, consisting of a couple of pizzas, wings, maybe 2 or 3 salads and a couple of sandwiches. I could live with that I suppose and I imagine it keeps food costs down when you specialize in only a few items. Our selections included the cheesy garlic bread, an order of wings (flavor: hot) and a large pizza advertised to have over 100 pepperonis on it. Over 100 pepperonis??? That's a no-brainer for me and my guy!!  

The cheesy garlic bread lacked flavor. Yes, there was cheese and yes there was garlic but I don't know how else to describe it other than blah. The cheese was nicely melted but not crusty or with carmelized edges, just lightly cheesed. It was served with a side of marinara which I felt it really needed. 

The wings were flavorful and oh, so tender. I just love tender wings where the meat just slides off and right in to my mouth. But these might as well have been Cornish game hen wings. They were very tiny. And at 10 for $10, I felt they were not worth my money despite the tenderness and flavor.

And that large pizza with over 100 pepperonis that we could hardly wait to sink our meat lovin' mouths in to? They were MINI-pepperonis. I fully expected to have a meaty, greasy, delicious pizza and I was disappointed in what I got. Sure, it was good  (not great) but wouldn't you expect a pizza advertised as having over 100 pepperonis to be COVERED in them with just little glimpses of cheese coming through? Yeah, not the case.

I really did have a great time at Rick's Pub & Grill and the crowd was A-MAZING. Rick, thank you for allowing the craziness to descend upon your establishment. RAAAIIIIDDEEERRSSSS!"}
{"text":"Great pizza and cold beer. Pizza is Ohio style not as good as Tommy's but close."}
{"text":"The staff is nice, and it's a nice little place. Just know that if you order a cocktail you're going to get a double whether you like it or not...and get charged double too."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been frequently been coming to this establishment since it opened. The last 2 times we have been there it hasn't been a good experience. The first time it was on president day, the person that was working at the time ( whom I have never met or seen there before) her name is Elizabeth. There was not that many people in the pub. There was 2 guys at the bar that she was having conversation with and did not come over to us for awhile. It took so long that I was the only one that ordered then we left. The second time was today march 3. We came in and it was her again. There was only a couple at the bar but she worked on the sign behind the bar for awhile. She finally came over and we ordered drinks and food but we didn't get our food for a good half hour. She had disappeared in the back for awhile. In that time a family of 4 came in and then they left because of no service and then 2 more people came in then they left she was still in the back. Then she finally comes out with a bottle of champagne and that took awhile. Finally the food came out and at that point it was not good we ate some of it but not very good. Another couple came in and they ordered and got their food in a timely matter. The cook brought their food out for them, I don't understand why that could not have happened for us. Needless to say if I go back I will not stay if she is working there."}
{"text":"Now this is a nice place right down the street... The food is great, and service is on point..my only knock i just wish there was more of that good food on the menu ...Still it is a great place to take friends and family....Cheer's Bluesman Mike"}
{"text":"First time visiting Rick's Pub and was lucky enough it was on a karaoke night. Good drinks and food, and great staff. The karaoke girl was probably best of all! A+ will come in again and recommend to others..."}
{"text":"My husband said his burger was good. I ordered the Asian chicken salad and it was lame. Lettuce looked a little old, dark chicken, no sunflower seeds or mandarin oranges, not enough almond silvers. Dressing was good but I wouldn't order this salad again."}
{"text":"So I'm here at ricks at happy hour only because I have already reviewed the 3 premier or tier 1 taverns in this area CKS 3rd Dirty Blonde 2nd and Charlis Tavern 1st - so Ricks is my 1st evaluation of the 2nd tier taverns in the area - kind of funny 1 server handling the entire bar - but two cooks - the server is spot on in handling the 20+ patrons - I never waited a second for anything - $2 well drinks and tap beer - nothing close at the tier 1s - then chips and homemade salsa at 3.99 - so for 10 dollars you are happy for a few hours - homemade salsa is great and chips a plenty - their yelp menu is all messed up so you really can't see anything there today - I mentioned it to the server - the tavern front is away from Ray so you drive right by it and don't see it - it's in the same complex as the library - needed the channel changed for a game - done in two minutes - nice part - server was dressed conservatively - and she talked about her husband and a party she held for her child - I'm old school - so I appreciate honesty - good food and good service with no games and no drama - try ricks and ask for Valerie"}
