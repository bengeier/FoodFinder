{"text":"Horrible costumer service, took an hour and half to get my food and didn't even get the order right. Incredibly rude staff."}
{"text":"Absolute the worst service that I have ever had in my life.  Food was OK but very overpriced.  I will never go back again."}
{"text":"Standard pizza place. Slightly overpriced for specialty pizza. They have wings and hoagies and that kind of thing as well."}
{"text":"Food was a bit cold and didn't get drink refills until food came pizza was good and so was the pasta and meatballs"}
{"text":"We walked in, sat there for five minutes, the waitress never took her eyes off her iPad, we left. Nobody said a word to us."}
{"text":"Dont be fooled.... it's not crowded for a reason.    No children's cups The TVs didn't work  They were out of taco pizza  And it's slow AF   ... there are plenty of other great places around. Wait the time it takes to get seated at those places. You'll be much more happy.    The long island were strong. ... I didn't say good.  I.forgot to say, we didn't get our food yet"}
{"text":"Pastas-calzone were good. Steak salad was steakums. Not 1 person was in the restaurant eating which was a bit uhh-oh. Overall the experience was good. My daughter is now ill from the steak salad."}
{"text":"Don't order the 'steak' salad. It's not steak. I'm told it's 'steakums'??? I'm unfamiliar. It wasn't great.  Anywho...pizza is fine but and mozzarella sticks are deep fried in a weird way I wish I could describe.   They're friendly and we'll likely use them again but kinda sad."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. I go here for lunch every Friday. I usually go here with 2-5 people. Everyone is always happy with their meal. We sit at the bar, always to be greeted by nicest lady on the planet. She is Turkish. She is always smiling and chatting with us. We look forward to seeing her, and she looks forward to seeing us. I get the same 2 things because I am so happy with them. I always either get the Buffalo Chicken Pizza(maybe my favorite in all of Pittsburgh, and I love my Pizza), or the Deluxe Italian Hoagie which is also awesome. I love my hoagies and pizza, and this place is top notch in both. MY co workers venture on the menu a bit with pasta, strombolis, calzones, and wedgies. Everyone ALWAYS likes what they get. We will continue to show our faces to this establishment every Friday. The bar is nice with a huge tv. This is where we usually all sit. It has 8 stools or so."}
{"text":"So delivery is rather quickly. However the driver is terrified of dogs. This is an issue as he won't even walk up to my door because my extremely friendly golden retriever is in the window..."}
{"text":"Via localflavor.com I purchased a 30 for 15 voucher, and finally had the chance to use it.  The place is clean and decorated with the typical Pittsburgh sports decorations.  The dining room is relatively small although it would be able to handle larger parties by pushing a few tables together, being there was 4 of us, we decided on a booth.    Beer:  I did notice it had a fully stocked bar, since I was having dinner with my kids, I didn't even look at the drink menu.  Food:  Is there any better meal than Pizza, Wings, and French Fries?  The French fries where not fresh cut but they were really good.  They came with a side of cheese sauce and even though it was a little on cooler side, it still was melty and tasted good.  The pizza was a little better than average.  Plenty of cheese and the sauce hit the mark.  As for the wings, we got the butter garlic wings and they were probably my favorite part of the meal.  The sauce had plenty of garlic flavor and the wings were fried perfectly.      Pros:  It is very clean.  The service was good and the food was good.   Conclusion:  My kids enjoyed the meal and it is now on the list of places to return to if dining in the Robinson area.  So I will be going back again."}
{"text":"Food is good, but the service is just absolutely terrible. We tried it for the first time because we had a coupon and the waitress was not friendly at all. We gave them another chance a week later and this tome it was even worse. The waitress was complaining about customers and gave an attitude when asked for plates. So we will not be going back."}
{"text":"I ordered take out from here tonight. The online ordering was really convenient and straight forward.  My wife and I both got gyros with a side of fries, garlic wings, and their breadsticks that they throw in for online orders over $20.  The gyros were ok, however all of the toppings were wet and soft. Worse yet, the gyros were really oily... how you turn what should be crisp gyro-goodness into a wet oily mess is beyond me. Adding insult to injury, they didn't include the cucumber sauce.  The fries...oh, the fries... I've had fries before that were sort of soft and oily that were delicious, these were not one of those. The fries were really greasy and soggy tasting. After sampling 5 fries, my wife and I concurred that they were destined for the trash. I ate a few more after that just to give them a fighting chance. Nope, I just couldn't do it to myself anymore. Straight to the trash can.  The wings were also sadly mediocre. Fairly oily without much flavor, enough said.  The saving grace of this meal ironically turned out to be the complimentary breadsticks! Hooray! They earned one additional star to the one I'm already obligated to award! But just to be clear, the breadsticks weren't really epic, they were just good, not great.  After our experience here, I doubt we'll be returning again in the near future. Even if we felt like ordering pizza instead, I think we'll take a gamble on one of the  several dozen other pizza places in the area."}
{"text":"I'm pretty upset about the experience here. I think the entire staff needs training. Waitress did not take order for 30 minutes. Once order was taken the food took an hour and a half to come out. Our friend didn't even get his food until after we were finished. Charged additional for refill. Was told that we were stealing when we got a refill......and told us we were on camera.  Charged additional gratuity. Said that bc there was a party of 6 that checks could not be broken up. Rude. So ridiculously rude. Can't understand what is going on? Is this place for real? This person was a manager apparently. No one else was in the restaurant! Service is bad. Work on it because the food is good!"}
{"text":"The chicken salad was bad just it was more lettuce than anything else.  At least out cucumbers there are more veggies"}
{"text":"This is the best so far pizza place in Robinson. I was there at least 20 times with my friends to grab some drinks or to have an awesome meal. All of the times were on high level. Service is fast, bartender is super friendly, the food is so delicious, the restaurant is very clean and has so many tvs so you can come here to watch a game. The portions are so big so you can even share for little money. The drinks are strong, and the bar has a great selection of liquor.  Besides a good dining experience, I also did order deliveries to my house. Usually it takes about 40 mins, food was always warm and made  to perfection. My favorite is jumbo chicken wings in hot sauce with homemade ranch on the side. OMG! You gotta try it especially if you like spicy. And for the pizza, ranchero steak... Yaaaamiii yaaaamiiiii. So I can definitely recommend this place for dining or deliveries or drinks! They always will treat you right!"}
{"text":"My fianc√© and I used to absolutely LOVE this place but recently the food has gone down hill...a lot. We would always get pepperoni rolls that were HUGE where I could barely finish 5 of the 8 given which made $7 totally worth it! They'd fill the entire to-go box. Now, the quality has gone down. This was not the first time, I gave it three try's the past month and each time they've gotten smaller and smaller...less cheese, smaller portions of ranch AND it's still the same price. Needless to say, we're not going to waste our money here again."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery from here for the first time using the Slice app. Was delivered right at the estimated time. And all of the food was nice and hot. I enjoyed the meatball hoagie and wing zings. My son have the tenders and fries. There was a healthy amount in the container. My wife had the baked ziti and it was perfect. Will definitely order there again."}
{"text":"Great little pizza restaurant in Robinson. Our recent visit was with a party of 15.  Nothing but great food and service.  Pizza, sandwiches , salads were all very good.  Full service bar and plenty of Tv's.  You won't be disappointed if it's a family night out or a group to enjoy a ball game on TV."}
{"text":"Pepperoni pizza was good.  The ratio of cheese to toppings was on point!  I would definitely order again! Oh, & the delivery was on time and the pizza was still hot"}
{"text":"The guys I work with go here every single Friday. So far their food picks haven't been great but I didn't bring a lunch so I figured I might as well. My boss also said they had his favorite buffalo chicken pizza of all pizza places in Pgh! And well, I am going to name my first born Frank, so I had to give it a shot.   I am very surprised there weren't more people in this place! It has a super convenient location with parking! And the atmosphere and food were both really good. The bar isn't that big so I don't really see this as being a huge Friday night spot? But the tv is gigantic and the bartender was really pretty. Hidden gem, perhaps? Also, and this is huge, the bar area was so clean. Like, immaculate. After watching so many episodes of Bar Rescue, it was a refreshing change!   I didn't give this place 5 stars for 2 reasons: we were there on lunch and the food took entirely too long to come out and because I am still wanting to try more before I commit to 5. My boss and I split the buffalo chicken, another friend got a stromboli and the 4th friend ordered a house salad. The pizza was very good. But if you like Franks hot sauce on your buff chix this isn't for you.  Their sauce was very good, don't get me wrong, but I prefer Frank's. My friend said his stromboli was great but I heard otherwise on the salad. Nothing to write home about really and it was all iceburg... but I mean I didn't expect much from a house salad.   The bartender/server remembered the guys and was very welcoming to me, the newbie. This is probably the only establishment I will continue to accompany them with for lunch."}
{"text":"Very nice, friendly place! Cozy dinning room and excellent service. Very nice place to have a dinner with your family or grab a drink with your friends. I often go there for my lunch break. Good selection of food. Waiting time no more than 15 min. Portions are huge! You can share them with your friends."}
{"text":"I really like that their online ordering allows me to include the tip, so that they basically just drop the pizza off.  However, the pizza is really mediocre. I had a small pizza with italian sausage and mushrooms. The mushrooms were basically poured right out of a can. The italian sausage were those little, tasteless rabbit poop type of sausage bits. Horrible.  Just don't expect quality food. If you're drunk and need fast delivery, you'll be good to go."}
