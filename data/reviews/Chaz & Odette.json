{"text":"My first and only experience with this restaurant was a week night dinner with a group of nine people.  The bar was great.   The appetizers were delicious and served expeditiously.  Some of the main courses  - mostly the sandwiches, appeared to be nicely prepared and presented.  My own dish, a paella, was uninteresting.  Over 10 minutes elapsed from the time the server arrived with the first person's main until the last main was presented, leading to cold food; I can't fault the server for lack of trying; the kitchen was obviously understaffed or inept.  

Since I initially wrote this review, I have learned more about the particulars of this event.  The owners graciously agreed to open just for my group, but they were extremely short on kitchen staff.  Given that circumstance, I now appreciate the situation and would absolutely return with my wife for an evening of good wine and food.  That said, I still didn't like the paella but would be very interested in trying some of the recipes that my associates obviously enjoyed."}
{"text":"We too wanted to love it BUT the service was slowwww very very slow and the food was eh and lukewarm as in temperature."}
{"text":"I was very excited by the menu at Chaz & Odette's, but the whole experience was extremely disappointing. They originally got our reservation wrong, but we were thankfully seated anyway. Service was very slow, from our waiter who was difficult to find to the *very* backed up kitchen (despite being one of the first tables there). We ordered the lamb meatballs and brussels sprouts for appetizers. The meatballs were luke warm, though the flavor was nice. The sprouts were tasty and probably were my favorite dish of the evening.

We then waited almost an hour to get our entrees. The brisket mac and cheese was very disappointing. We had three small pieces of brisket with bland mac and cheese. The collards served with it were completely unseasoned. I cannot believe they charged $24 for such a small, bland portion. The apricot goat cheese pizza was tasty, but the toppings were very sparse. Each bite was mostly just dough. The burger was overdone, and the accompanying fries were burnt and honestly the worst fries I've ever had. The chicken wings and waffles were cold, which is not surprising given how long we waited to be served.

Everything was just uninspiring, cold, and not well-seasoned."}
{"text":"went for lunch........

the zucchini pancakes were under cooked and the batter still apparent...and rather tasteless.. Then had a BLT with home made bacon and homemade bread.. Completely boring... No interesting dressing on sandwich and skimpy ingredients..Shared a friends grilled cheese with soggy homemade cauliflower bread versus a nice crusty one to complement the soggy cheese ingredients..Probably will not try the place again."}
{"text":"I have now been sitting at this restaurant for an hour and forty-five minutes and still have not received my entree. It doesn't matter how good the food might be, my experience (and by the way, everyone else dining here is also waiting for their meals) is terrible. I'll never come back here again. It's not the waiter's fault, it's totally the kitchen.

I left the restaurant at 9 pm, without ever receiving my entree. I got here at 7. I'll never go back."}
{"text":"we made a reservation for 10 people, all of us had paid for babysitters that night AND driven in from various suburbs and parts of town. there was snow that weekend and so had called the restaurant MULTIPLE times to confirm our reservation. NO RESPONSE. we got to the restaurant and it was closed! all the other restaurants in the area were open. (THANK YOU Avenue B for accommodating our large group, dietary restrictions and a delicious meal). 
It's fine if you choose to close your restaurant, but the professional thing to do is to call your patrons to let them know so they can make alternate plans. 
no one even bothered to call/respond to our numerous voicemails when the restaurant finally DID open. When we finally got in touch with them, the guy was completely unapologetic and acted like \"what the hell do you want me to do about it\". Here's an idea: how about, apologize, offer to make it up to us, etc. etc. NOTHING! 
If this is the obnoxious and lackadaisical attitude they have toward customer service, I worry about the quality and care they put into their food. we will definitely not be back.

{"text":"I wasn't impressed, and I thought it was too much money for what we got. The food was unremarkable. We ordered the brussel sprouts and meatballs as appetizers and korean chicken flatbread and brisket mac & cheese for mains. The best thing out of that bunch was the meatballs. Besides the food being meh, I thought the dishes were skimpy on the meat. The flatbread had some meager pieces of chicken on it that were pretty tasteless; and the \"brisket mac & cheese\" had a piece of brisket on top and then a few and far between small pieces in the pasta - both examples annoyed me especially when considering what they were charging. 
If you go, order something we didn't so I know if we just chose poorly! 
A lot of other reviewers complained about the service, our server was just fine."}
{"text":"I went there for dinner on Valentine's day weekend.  It was a great meal, the wine list was excellent and the food delicious.  The Brussels sprouts were among the best I've ever had.  I had the duck cassoulet (sp?) and my wife had le coq au vin.  They were both great.  To top it off, the chocolate raspberry cake was absurdly good.  Chaz was cooking that evening and was a gracious host, he visited our table and didn't rush the conversation.  

Honestly I was suprised at the reviews being as low as they currently are, I can only assume they had some kinks to work out upon opening, which it appears they surely have.  I'll be back without question."}
{"text":"I visited this restaurant last night on 8/17/16 with a group of 4 friends for restaurant week. We made a reservation beforehand so we were expected.  We arrived around 6:30pm and did not leave until 10PM.  There was a humogous delay between meals.  We were all so disappointed.  
We received our restaurant week appetizer in a decent amount of time.  However, afterwards we waited forever for our entree.  When the waiter came back to check on us, he said he was bringing our dessert and we told him we hadn't had our entree yet.  We continued to wait and noticed other patrons waiting as well or leaving.  We also saw patrons that came after us, get their food before us.  Finally we received our dinner entrees and the food the temperature was off.  Everything was cold. I ordered the steak.  Eating cold steak was not funn or delicious but I was starving at that point.  Also the waiter stopped asking us if we wanted more drinks.  We watched a waitress spill water on the floor, look at it and walk away.  She never came back to clean up.  It stayed there the entire time.
Finally when dessert arrived, everything was ice cold as well.  My friend ordered the mousse and it was liquidity; not mousse quality at all.  2 friends did not get their dessert.  When the waiter came back to tell us he was bringing us the check, we reminded him that we were still waiting on 2 more desserts.  We were completely confused at the lack of service, the cold food all night, and the excessive amount of time it took for everything.
The waiter did discount our bill which we appreciated, but it did not make up for the experience.  While everything seemed like it would have a good flavor, being served cold/ room temperative food and poor service made it a terrible experience.  This was our first and last time visiting this restaurant."}
{"text":"This was our first time at Chaz and Odette and it won't be our last. The service was amazing, Eric, our waiter was warm and attentive. He took particular care with our drink orders and made great appetizer suggestions. We started with the Brussel  
Sprouts they were to die for. We continued with more small plates, salads and flatbread. All were wonderful. My favorite however, was the  smoked brisket flatbread. It was absolutely heavenly. The farro salad was also outstanding. For desert, we had cheesecake that was homemade and quite good. The downside to desert was the lack of chocolate on the menu. The coffee could have been stronger and more flavorful ( that was our recommendations). All in all a great dining experience. I would recommend the restaurant and plan to go back in the near future."}
{"text":"I had really high hopes for Chaz & Odette and hope that a future visit will be better.  My main beef with the restaurant was our service. Now, I don't want to rip on the service of the whole restaurant, but our server in particular was not good. In the beginning, the server rushed us and tried to get our order when we were clearly not ready (right after 2 of 3 of us had sat down). Then, when my glass of wine had been empty for 10-15 minutes, I tried to ask the server for another glass but the server walked away as I was speaking.  Then, it took me two attempts to try to flag the server down so I could order a second glass.  The place seemed busy but not overcrowded, so I was a little confused.  Later, after dessert was ordered and I ordered coffee, the server acted confused as to why I was ordering coffee (\"do you want decaf?\") after dinner (no, I didn't want decaf).  Then when my coffee was brought out, I had to flag the server down again to ask for cream, as none was brought.

The server was nice but seemed absent minded and maybe wasn't trained well?  I don't think the server had previous service experience.

The food was fine.  I had the pork dish but the rice and red beans served underneath the pork were completely cold as soon as I got the dish.  The dish tasted good, but the pork was also dry.

The table split the beignets for dessert.  Only half were covered with powdered sugar.

The food tasted good, but the bad service and cold food left a bad taste in my mouth.  With so many great restaurants popping up in Pittsburgh, I'm not sure I'll find the time to get back to a place I only felt so-so about.  I'm hoping things change for them."}
{"text":"Brussels sprouts are a must. Farro salad was excellent. The staff was very courteous and helpful"}
{"text":"Very surprised to find upon arrival that the restaurant was locked up tight with a for sale sign  on the door. Their website shows no indication of this. Disappointed"}
{"text":"Don't think I've ever had a worse meal at a restaurant.

I went to Chazz & Odette with high hopes. I'm a huge fan of the many new restaurants in Pittsburgh and have enjoyed many, many wonderful meals at them. But this may have been the worst meal I've ever had. 

I was greeted rudely when I told the waitress that I didn't have any lunch reservations but was hoping to get a table for two. Even though there were many empty tables (that remained empty through our lunch there), I was treated brusquely and was told to wait while she made a phone call that went on for minutes. Another waitress saw me standing there and asked if she could help but when I told her I was waiting to be seated, she merely nodded and went away. I was eventually given a table and it was then set - for one. I reminded my waitress that there was someone joining me and she did set a second setting. We eventually  placed our order. The waitress forgot my order of hot tea until I reminded her of it ten minutes later. Then she forgot the sugar I had asked for. After waiting for five minutes, I got up and asked the bartender for sugar. We had to wait an inordinately long time for our food. Ironic, given that most of it was drastically undercooked. Our appetizer orders of zucchini latkes arrived with the inside cold and almost liquid. The main dish arrived and was simply awful. My friend couldn't eat his burger - it too was undercooked and the toppings were horrid. After lunch, I ordered coffee and beignets. The coffee came without the cream I had asked for and with no spoon. Again, I had to wait until I could grab a waitress and get what I needed to have a simple cup of coffee. The beignets arrived and when I bit into the first one, the liquid center came out. I wondered if they were custard stuffed or some such but, no, they were just so undercooked that the dough was liquid in 50% of the inside. 

Absolutely awful food and horrible service. I will never go back and I would suggest you never go in the first place - there are far too many good restaurants in this city vying for customers that are completely worthy of your money and will treat & feed you well."}
{"text":"Their Reuben baked flatbread and hunters stew were delicious... plus a new drink was wonderful & potent... great service in intimate setting ... a great relax and kick back place"}
{"text":"Wow, what can I say - it was fabulous!  We split two starters (roasted brussel sprouts, and the lamb meatballs); plus the beef brisket Mac n cheese, and the roasted Tuscan vegetable flatbread- all of the were them were excellent.  We ended by splitting two desserts ( the beignets, and the apple cobbler) again delicious.  The only reason they are getting 4 stars is that the wine list was very limited but I'm sure it will grow over time.  Chaz & Odette keep up the great work, we can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Zagat got it wrong.

I went over the holidays on a seemingly slow night (half the seating was full) excited to try the menu after the Zagat article mention.  The first disappointment came with the 'wine list', there was absolutely no selection. We passed and went with water.

We started with the charred brussels sprouts appetizer, this was the unflattering highlight of the night.  The flavors were good, the honey and balsamic played well together.  The downfall was that half the sprouts were just mere burnt leaves rather than full or halved meaty sprouts.  It left us wishing for much more at the $9 sticker price.

***approx 60 minute wait until dinner was served after the app***

Finally the mains. Spicy Chicken Wings and Waffles on one side, Brisket Mac and Cheese on the other.  Let's start with the biggest let down, the Spicy Chicken Wings and Waffles.  The wing sauce was actually quite delicious and the wings were slightly overdone but not bad.  Now for the abhorrent, the waffles were cold, hard, dry and rather tasteless.  I literally asked the waiter if they were supposed to be that way or maybe they were cooked the previous day?  He said no, they should have been served warm.  Maybe it was the 60 minute wait that did them in (hint, hint)!  C'mon Chaz, $22 for 4 wings and a hockey puck waffle?

The Brisket Mac and Cheese was warm and steaming, but once you broke through the few strands of brisket on top, there was no more meat to be found in the watery bowl of tasteless cheesy/soupy slop that remained underneath. And to top it off, we paid $24 buckeroos for that bowl of slop!

The waiter was courteous but never offered to fix any of our issues with the food, nor offered any $$$ remedy when it came time to pay the man.  We gladly passed on desert, paid the check and said \"See ya again, never!\"

There are way too many great restaurants in this city, don't waste your time on this pretender.  Let them work out their kinks on someone else."}
{"text":"I love the concept behind Chaz & Odette's and I love the food. The Brussels Sprouts were delicious, an unusual appetizer and beautifully prepared. I also enjoyed the Spanish sausage and peppers. For dessert I ordered the cheesecake with mango, which was phenomenal. The staff here is welcoming and the service was excellent. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"You have got to try the mojitos! Fresh mint grown in house and a knowledgeable bartender makes all the difference. Drinks are a bit pricey but this isn't your average \"College kid Oakland bar\"."}
{"text":"This place is really great and worth a try. They make all of their cured meats in house- and their bread as well. I had the margarita flat bread and the dough was beyond amazing. Salad was really fresh and light. Great wine and they had a limoncello pound cake that was divine."}
{"text":"We were excited to try this place out given the press, and the owners' backgrounds. Unfortunately, the experience was awful. And for the life of me, I can't figure out why for once I did not read the Yelp reviews before trying a place!

Beers: 4 were on tap, no bottles. Strange selection, a smoked porter, porter, IPA and something else odd that I don't recall. Beer lovers should look elsewhere. 

Wine: The wonderful Toast list is long gone. The list is admirable in supplying 15 or so wines at $30-40, but there is little depth to the offerings at this price point.  We had a bottle of prosecco for $34. Probably a $14 wine. Such is dining out. 

Food: Would give zero stars. 

\"Korean\" chicken flatbread with \"roasted corn:\" the sauce was tomato with red pepper flakes. There was maybe 2 ounces of dry chicken. The corn was drained canned corn that had been sporadically hit by a torch. Do not order. And it was small. And $16. 

Cassoulet: dry duck, in a somewhat tasty sauce, served barely warm. For $24. 

We marveled at how quickly the food came out, then realized what this meant. There is no way a cassoulet should come from the kitchen at a fine restaurant in 10 minutes. The food was pre-made and re-heated, we speculate. 

Other random thoughts: the point-of-sale screen at the bar still has huge Toast! graphic screen saver, making us long for the good old days. The large Chaz and Odette sign behind the bar fell off the wall when the binder clips holding it there failed. The bartender was nice enough but was texting a lot. Perhaps when it is not too busy, engaging the customers would be more appropriate. 

Overall a huge waste of $72 before tip. We will not return, but we wish Toast! would."}
{"text":"Went to Chaz and Odette for my birthday dinner last month... made reservations at 8pm in advanced for 5 we had the upstairs back room to ourselves which was really nice. 

Things started out pretty well.. we got a bottle of wine and other drinks. It took a long time but he seemed busy so we didn't mind. Since it was going a little slow we decided to order our apps and main course at the same time. The apps came out fine. The pizza was a little burnt but it was still edible. 

Dinner was awful though.. Every dish except the mac n cheese was cold. Like not even warm, cold. We had the Chicken and Waffles and they were hard as rock, the grits were so disgustingly cold, the second pizza was way to burnt etc.  The worst part was the server didnt come around to check on us because we would have been fine just asking him to microwave it or something to heat it up. 

When he did finally check on us we pointed out that 4/5 dinners were cold and he straight up said he \"probably let them sit down there too long\" 

He then asked if we were interested in dessert but we said no because it was already after 10 and dinner was over 2 hours so we didnt want to wait another 30 mins for dessert. 

I hope these were just some new kinks that they straighten out but if not i would not recommend going here."}
{"text":"Beautiful and cozy atmosphere. Jazz music is playing in the background, and there is also live jazz music on Sundays! 

Food is delicious and very unique. Waiters and waitresses were also very nice and professional. The bar area is also really nice, and a great place to go to with friends. 

The brussel sprout appetizer is to die for. The tapas (small appetizers) are also great. I got the margarita flatbread, Acaraje tapa, and the sliders. All were amazing and cooked to perfection!"}
{"text":"Just opened up in the same space as Toast under new management.  Menu is still evolving but the food is very good and prices reasonable especially for lunch.  Flatbread and roasted veggies were especially good.  They have kept the shrimp and grits from the toast menu but the current rendition seems more authentic

The restaurant looks small (less than 10 tables) but it has an upstairs area that can accommodate groups."}
{"text":"Oh, I so desperately wanted to like this place.  As a pretty firmly anti-chain, pro-small business person, I'm such a cheerleader (albeit one who wouldn't look good in a skirt) for the independent restaurants popping up around Pittsburgh.  However, two things can really sum up this experience.  The first is that both of us looked at each other and said \"Well, our moms could eat here.\"  Though we both love our mothers dearly, they are the type who tend to ask \"what's that interesting seasoning you have on this?\" and you have to honestly answer \"salt and pepper.\"  The second factor is that we were looking for some place we've never been for restaurant week, and looking over the menus online, my husband chose this restaurant.  He had to have apologized 20 times throughout the course of the dinner for his \"bad pick.\"  

First, the positive.  The cocktail menu, albeit small and not especially cohesive, was much more reasonable than a lot of other local restaurants.  One sangria and one kir flight of chardonnay ($14 bucks total), and I was definitely buzzed.  Secondly, the servers were all very friendly and attentive.  There was a new girl training with our waitress who was still a little unfamiliar with things, but hey, people have to start somewhere, and she was definitely trying, so zero complaints there.

Sadly, the lionshare of what you pay for at a nice restaurant is the food, and this was soooooo not worth it.  It was restaurant week, so they had only two menus available (a vegetarian price fixe and a carnivore price fixe).  We both had the meat-laden options.  First, if you're having only such a limited menu available for restaurant week, most likely to showcase what your restaurant is all about to new customers, you better nail those three or four dishes.  We had the sausage trio and the brisket trio.  All of the meat was dry as a bone, though the pickled vegetables, cheese, and bread were good accompaniments.  Also, no one told us what the different meats or cheeses were...that's rule #1 when serving any type of charcuterie platter.  We just sort of ate it.  The entree was a mixed grill.  First, I love me some meat, but come on...let's balance the meal out a little bit!  Secondly, apparently Jimmy Buffett isn't the only one in Margaritaville looking for his lost shaker of salt...where the heck was the flavor?  The meat was dry and tough, it sat in a pool of water (I'd say broth but broth has flavor), and it was served with potatoes (also unseasoned) and a half of an ear of corn (which, when you're at a \"nice\" restaurant sipping wine and eating charcuterie, is a big ol' ear of corn on the cob the most elegant vegetable choice you could come up with?  Lastly, the dessert.  We both had the chocolate crepes.  How can you do this to crepes?  They were cold as ice...clearly all pre-made.  Not even a browning mark from the crepe ever being in a skillet with a little butter.  The filling tasted like chocolate pudding, topped with Cool-Whip (or, as the menu calls it, chantilly cream).  The only redeeming quality was the chopped hazelnuts and chocolate on top.  Normally I'd give this place a one-star based on food, but the service and my wine-induced sense of generosity are making me \"ok\" with 2 stars.

Unfortunately, the complaints weren't limited to us.  The table behind us said the same thing about the dryness of the meat and the lack of flavor...they complained to the waitress and had their drinks comped, so I guess we should have been more vocal.  I try to be more subtle with my dissatisfaction, so I paid for all of my drinks.  The table beside us barely touched their entree, and their waiter said \"you must be leaving room for your crepes!\"  They were not amused.  I want for this place to succeed, because I believe in the power of small business over the processed, pre-fabricated food that a lot of chain restaurants push on us, but if they don't change quickly, they aren't going to make it.  This is a smaller city with a burgeoning foodie population, and a lot of restaurants coming and going.  To survive, they have to not only acknowledge the shortcomings, but do something to fix them FAST.  This many negative reviews is not a coincidence.  I wish them the best, and whoever Chaz and Odette are, I hope that they can pick themselves up and do some productive reflection.  At this stage in the game, however, as we sit depressed that we spent over $100 on a meal where both of us would have rather eaten at TGIFridays, we most certainly will not be back."}
{"text":"I took my wife there for my birthday dinner tonight. the food was great, loved the brussel sprouts, and we both had paella, she had vegetarian and I had regular.   The menu was great because she is vegetarian and I'm not and there were ample choices for both of us.  The decor is quaint an the ambiance is enjoyable.  I would say if you get a chance check them out."}
{"text":"I am a physician at Shadyside, unfortunately I will not return. Disorganized service, many things on the menu unavailable, food unmemorable. French fries were raw potato in heavy beer batter, not a great accompaniment to the burger. Good location and atmosphere for after work drinks, however restaurant was empty and food was too mediocre to return. I would give it another chance if there is improvement."}
{"text":"I stopped by here 2 nights ago with my wife and her parents for dinner during restaurant week.  After looking over a number of different restaurant week menus Chaz & Odettes looked the best.  So I called them up to make reservations and secured a table for 7:30.  Our party actually ended up arriving about 15 minutes early.  We stood in the doorway for a bit before being greeted and ultimately being taken to our table.  The inside of Chaz and Odettes isn't very big with a bar on the left side of the restaurant and a number of tables on the right.

For dinner on this evening I decided to go with the carnivore pre fixe menu.  I chose the brisket three ways for my appetizer, the sirloin steak with hobo bacon for my entree and the palmier for my dessert.  The brisket came out on a chopping block with some cheeses and a side of sourdough bread which resembled a pita.  I would say that I enjoyed both the corned beef and pastrami versions of the brisket while I didn't care much for the third, the smoked brisket.  It's odd because my wife had the brisket as part of her meal and it was really good.  I did really enjoy ripping up the bread and putting the meat in it like a sandwich. After we had finished with our appetizers our entrees came out.  My sirloin steak was topped with the mushrooms, onions and hobo bacon (Canadian bacon?) as mentioned on the menu and came with some roasted potatoes and the fresh picked vegetables which was a half an ear of corn with mayo on it.  I dug into the steak first which I had ordered medium.  Sadly it was extremely overcooked to the point that I think calling it well done would have been generous although it wasnt burnt.   Due to that it was the driest and worst steak that I have had in a long time.  Thankfully the toppings for it were tasty but didn't do much to add moisture to it.  I was similarly disappointed with the potatoes and corn both of which were ok but neither of which I would order again.  Last but not least was dessert which for me consisted of a palmier along with vanilla pastry cream and blueberries and raspberries.  I first broke the palmier in half and tried it on its own.  It was hard and didn't have much taste to it so I added some pastry cream and fruit which made it taste good.  Weirdly the other side of the palmier was quite good as instead of being hard it was flaky and gave off a caramel flavor.

The bottom line for me is that I probably wouldn't head back to Chaz and Odettes in the future.  Much like the palmier, some of the food that I had was pretty good, some of it also was not.  Due to that inconsistency I don't really see a reason to come back."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch and was blown away...I started with the Brussels sprouts for an appetizer, they were the best thing I have eaten in a while. Perfectly roasted with honey balsamic glaze, the flavor combination in this dish was a home run. For the main course I tried the cured meats 3 ways charcuterie plate and found this to be perfection as well; the meats were great and the cheese, pickled vegetables, and sourdough bread accompanying them were all fresh and terrific complements to the meats. 

Service was great and the restaurant itself has nice decor and a cool atmosphere. The bar is gorgeous! I can't wait to go back here and try the rest of their menu and cocktails."}
{"text":"Wow, those other reviews are harsh!  They don't reflect my experience on a Friday night. First off, don't worry about parking...there is plenty on the street.  The interior is intimate, banquettes against the wall, kitchen in the back. Bar against the other wall.  Unlike many restaurants today, you can hear your tablemates.  Yes, the beer list is small. But it is well curated with local brews from Grist Mill, Spoonwood and others.  If you want 60 taps, go to Houghs.  Similarly, I thought the wine list was very good. Small but thoughtful.  The Old Soul Lodi Cabernet was delicious.  When we ordered it, the waiter, without prompting asked if we would like it decanted.  But of course!  When was the last time someone offered to decant your wine?  As far as pricing goes, it is better than most.  The reviewer who complained about  paying $38 for a $14 Prosecco, got off easy;  the usual markup for wine in Pittsbugh is 3x. Besides, they are serving wines that you cannot get at the State Store.  

On to the food. The charred brussel sprout appetizer was as advertized, charred. But not burnt...that's a fine line. Very strong flavor but, hey, they are sprouts.   The Mrs. had the Smoked Beef Brisket Mac and Cheese.  It's plenty rich but not overly smoky.  The cheddar and smoke are a good match.  Our guests ordered the moussaka and the cassoulet and both enjoyed them. I was busy with the Aux Champignon flatbread.  The crust had the right amount of snap; not soggy at all.  Mushroom had a deep, woody flavor that worked well with the tang of the goat cheese and the sweet of the marscapone.  This would be a good appetizer for four.  

Service was attentive, noise level was pleasant, food was good, wine fairly priced (and they decant!)  We all agreed that we would return to C & O."}
{"text":"Been to Chaz & Odette's twice. 

The Goods:
-- Charming décor, both downstairs and upstairs. Downstairs is more of a warm, casual feel, with small tables lining the wall across from the visually-appealing bar.  Upstairs is exposed brick décor with a bit more formality, but still casual.
-- Location. Ain't much else in this quality range near the area. Like an upscale good neighborhood restaurant.
-- Promise. There's so much to like here: aspiring menu with contemporary American cuisine. And the staff is eager.

The Others:
-- The food. Two visits allowed me to try 3 appetizers and 2 entrees. All were good, but not the standard I would expect for the price point. The Brussel sprout appetizer was less Brussel sprouts and more almost charred Brussel sprout leaves. Cooked too far beyond the caramelizing point. The meatballs lacked the punch you want in an appetizer. The spinach salad was dominated by the spinach taste, not a mix of flavors with the spinach as the base flavor. On the entrees, the mac and cheese was just too much for my taste (hey, mac & cheese is a side). The Tomahawk Chop was under seasoned and overcooked, so it was dry and had little taste.
-- The presentation. Every hot dish we had was moving rapidly toward cold when delivered. The plates and serving pieces (steak knives, etc.) were ice cold when delivered to the table. As a result, the food soon was tepid temperature, at best.
-- The service. Gosh, they are trying hard. But not quite there. Both times servers walked past and didn't clear finished plates or extra utensils. They don't seem to have the rhythm of a meal down, either. Ready to order? Oh! you want drinks first. Let me bring your check. Oh! You want dessert. Friendly, warm, but not trained.
-- The upstairs. It was moderately chilly outside, but the upstairs was freezing. We moved tables 3 times to try and find a comfortable place. And we finally opted for our coats (downstairs seemed warmer and cozier). And all three tables we were at had issues. The first: it was wedged against a light so one of the two chairs was unusable. The second: it was crammed against the wall, so getting into and out of the chair was a chore. Once you were in, the space was adequate, providing you didn't want to lean back or scoot away from the table. The third: there was a palm that was eye/ear height behind me that kept poking me...even after we pulled the table out a bit.
-- The bar. No single malt scotch? Really?
-- The price. Had the food hit its objective, it would have been acceptably pricey. But for the experience, it's not appropriate.

Bottom Line: I hope the owners get there. Chaz & Odette's has such promise it would be a shame if they don't. But I won't be back for a while until they do..."}
{"text":"I haven't written a review in a while but I feel I must share my experience about Chaz & Odette.  We went 7:30 on Saturday night and the place had just a few other guests.  We ordered two drinks - Daiquiri and Gimlet - they were both fine.  It is the food that really needs work.

beet/spinach/egg salad - really not worth $8.  it was underwhelming, not hand tossed, and the croutons were soft. 

korean bbq flatbread - BURNED.  it was basically not edible because of how much black was on the bottom.  i had to send it back.  they said they could make another one but said they couldn't promise it would look different so i just said forget it.  

chicken and waffles - the waffle was dry, soft, nowhere near crispy, and mealy.  we left most of it on the plate.  the chicken was the only saving grace, it had a good flavor.

Overall, nothing irks me more than paying good money for bad food.  I was disappointed that the burned flatbread still made it onto our bill of $68.  We won't be back obviously and I'll be trying to forget the taste of burned flatbread for a while yet."}
{"text":"Stand-out seasonal menu, great food, and great service.  Local beer menu is a plus.  House-made charcuterie and satisfying portions.  Will be back."}
{"text":"We got a few dishes to split--the macaroni and cheese, the brussel sprouts, the curry chicken flatbread. We weren't sure what we liked the most, and we weren't sure how we ate it all so fast. The beignets for dessert were served with two sauces--we unapologetically drank the sauces after the beignets were devoured. The chef gave us two glasses of champagne to celebrate our birthdays, which was the nicest gesture.

Chaz & Odette's offers a quiet and inviting atmosphere with multiple floors of seating, friendly service, and fantastic food. They also cater and host events, which is tempting. It's always worth heading a bit out of the way for a good meal."}
{"text":"I went for dinner here with a few friends on a Friday. We ordered cocktails and appetizers to start. The cocktails arrived in time and were really good. I had a negroni which was very nice. 
We ordered Asian shrimp and Korean bbq pizza for apps. They were quite spicy and incredibly delicious. Since all of us love spicy food, we were quite happy. For dinner we ordered pasta, coq au vin. The chicken was tender and full of flavor. The pasta was one of the best I have had. We also shared a sweet potato dessert which was very good. Overall everyone loved the food.
I would have given this place five stars but the food took a while to arrive and the ambience is meh for the price. I would like to try this place again soon."}
{"text":"The reviewers have done a great disservice to this business.  I was there last night and couldn't have enjoyed it more.  First, the atmosphere, intimate: a lovely bar and about twenty tables, rough wood paneling that absorbed sound.  It's a quiet restaurant!  And, layed out in such a way that the cold winter air stayed outside when guests came in.  Warm, quiet, comfortable, what more could you ask for?

Next the staff, both the bartender and waiter were very helpful with recommendations.  The cocktails and wine were great and affordable.  Oh yeah, they had five local CRAFT beers on tap, if you're looking for a tall frosty Bud Light, go to Chili's!  

Our party had flatbreads, moussaka, pasta and coq au vin and all of us were delighted with our choices.  Apple cobbler and sweet potato / coconut tart for dessert were delicious.

I really can't say enough good things about Chaz and Odette's and am genuinely saddened by some of these reviews.  They slander a small business and make it more difficult for them to survive.  Go to Chaz and Odette's.  See for yourself.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great vibe and seasonal menu. On Sunday they have jazz. The chef came out to talk to us and was so wonderful. Definitely check it out."}
{"text":"This place is super cute. The menu is diverse with its NOLA flare. The service is excellent and the wait staff is so kind. The was so kind and talks to each table. Live jazz on Sunday nights creates a great atmosphere."}
