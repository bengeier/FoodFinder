{"text":"Poutine is one of my fave foods. Unfortunately I cannot go as often as of like because the do not have a wheelchair ramp, and it is really hard trying to get a stroller up 3 stairs and hold the doors open.   The poutines are good, the prices for the amount isn't the best, but it fills you up. Staff is friendly, good, sometimes a little loud music plays.  Along with the poutines they sell fresh baked treats. That just thinking of them makes my mouth water."}
{"text":"The BEST pouting I've had! It is so good and they have so many options and toppings you can put on top of your poutine. They also have hot dogs and other things I believe! The employees are so friendly, nice and inviting. The owner is really cool and fun..   They also have cards they stamp for every poutine you get and than after I think it's 6 you get 1 free"}
{"text":"I was walking along Main St in Brampton, and was hungry, but what to eat? My conundrum left me hungry, cold and bewildered. I walk aimlessly looking for food, and a behold; a green smiley face. Could it be?! A poutine restaurant in Brampton?!? You mean I dont have to drive downtown to go to a competitors restaurant like Smoke's Poutinerie?!?  I tried this place yesterday whilst out with a friend yesterday, and I have to say, I loved it.  The staff behind the counter was really friendly, and the pricing was pretty fair considering the portion sizes. Its a little pricier than the Harvey's and other burger joint poutines, but its worth it.  One thing to note, they use a vegetarian gravy, which I wasn't particularly fond of, but C'est la vie. -1 star for vegetarian gravy. Vegetarians have oppressed us meat eaters long enough, they can f**k off and find their own restaurant for all I care. You made a choice to be vegetarian, don't come to my restaurant and demand vegan gravy....yuck.  Asides from that slip-up, this place was fair. I ordered the regular Pulled BBQ pork poutine with a steamie and water and it came out to around $15.   Taste wise, the BBQ pork is cooked properly and its moist and tender, the way it should be. Fries are thick cut with the skins still on. Being an Irish Canadian, I consider myself quite the potato connoisseur, a spud doctor if you will. These fries are fresh cut, I know that for a fact because my taste-buds tell me so.  The steamie was an ordinary hotdog, I liked the steamed effect, reminded me of a boiled hotdog as a kid. Real Canadian soul food.   All in all, this was a good choice. My stomach was purring, and all was good in the world.   Give it a shot, you wont be disappointed."}
{"text":"Am glad that I can eat finest poutine in my neighborhood, actually its one of the best in GTA area.  I personally didn't like butternut squash & sweet peas, nothing wrong with poutine but it just personal preference.  Anyways chili-cheese supreme (vegetarian one) is the best so try that if you are vegetarian like me.  Make sure you mention vegetarian or else you will end up getting beef one.  Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"Although I am from the US, I love Poutine!  The food at this restaurant was very good and there was a varity of Poutine dishes. The staff was very friendly and polite to us. The atmosphere of the dining room was bright and colorful. If you like good food especilly Poutine I highly recommend this eatery. I will be back whenever I am in this area."}
{"text":"Was waiting for my order to be prepared at The Works which is right around the corner from this place. I decided to buy my poutine from here just so I could try it. This is more of a take out type of place, there were a few seats but not a pleasant sitting area. The poutine was made within minutes and was good."}
{"text":"Their Classic Poutine was delicious and quite \"authentic\" tasting. I'm from Montreal so I know a thing or two about poutine!   The gravy was the star -- dark, rich and tasty!  The fries were thick cut and held up well under a hefty serving of gravy. The cheese was proper -- the squeaky curd kind -- although I would have liked more cheese. The serving of cheese was light compared to other poutine establishments I have visited. *hint hint management*  I will be back the next time I'm in Brampton.  Hopefully my next poutine will be cheesier!"}
{"text":"Hungry naked lady: I'm hungry. Hot Canadian dude: You're always hungry. What do you want to eat for lunch? Hungry naked lady: Umm, something Canadian? *pulls up Yelp in Brampton* Hot Canadian dude: Like? Hungry naked lady: Hmm, do you eat poutine? Hot Canadian dude: Yeah. Of course.  Hungry naked lady: Ok, have you tried this place? *shows him yelp page* Hot Canadian dude: Nope but it's about 20 minutes away. Do you want something closer? Hungry naked lady: *insert inappropriate comment about gravy* Hot Canadian dude: Ok, it's time to feed you.  And feed we did. Clothes. Car. Order. I finally had piping hot poutine with crispy fries, slathered in a sumptuous gravy and perfectly melted cheese curds to quell my hunger. Add extra mayo, and ohhh, it's so heavenly. Breaded dill pickles, fried egg, bacon, onion rings -- you cannot go wrong here. Next time, a steamie to go with it all.  Apparently from my experience in the States with poutine, I've never had it so good. It doesn't seem to be that difficult to make fries with gravy and cheese curds. But after countless times of eating what seemed like mozzarella cheese and powdered gravy mix on top of soggy fries, I pretty much have given up on crappy US poutine. Thankfully now I know where to go, albeit, I'm nine hours and several thousand miles (or rather kilometers) away. Still, I'm so delighted that even my experienced poutine connoisseur agreed that this place was absolutely delicious.  So there you go. Hot Canadian dude approved.  If you're in the area and looking for poutine, this poutinerie does it right. Condiment bar included. Don't be surprised though when you have a food baby at the end of your meal. Yep, be prepared to be rolled out the door (and hopefully across the street to the ice cream/gelato shop.)   Happy eating!"}
{"text":"This was my first time here and it was amazing! Dont let the size of the restaurant fool you. The Poutines here are to die for. My favorite is the BBQ Pulled Pork 10/10, you cannot go wrong with it. They have amazimg combinations and something for everyone.   The only thing i wouldnt recommend is the desserts they offer. I tried 3 out of 5 and found the all very sugary with little taste difference.   Even the kettle cooked popcorn they sell is good....just not the desserts. Try them if you want but if you have diabetes I highly suggest that you don't.  Other poutines i tried were the beacon double cheese burger 8/10. You have to be a huge beacon lover for this because there is a lot.  As well the Philly cheese steak poutine 9/10. This was my dads favorite. Great mixture of ingredients, but would have preferred mushrooms instead of onions.  The chicken fingers are really food as well. Good size and some extra to have woth the Poutine if your feeling extra hungry but honest not necessary if you order a medium or large poutine as it will fill you up.  Happy eats xoxo"}
{"text":"I wanted some pouting and this was first time coming here, well they didn't appoint me. The feel and look of the place was great but their are few seating in the place. The cashier was friendly and helpful with the menu.  I went ahead and ordered their Vege Mushroom Melt Poutine... basically it was fries topped with sauteed mushrooms and plenty of cheddar! The poutine was quite tasty and enjoyable.    The only off thing was if you have a stroller you will have pick it up as they have 2 steps in the front."}
{"text":"Will definitely return.  This place has been around almost 5yrs,  first time I've gone. Delish!!!!  I had the Fully Load Poutine (I'm not a bacon lover) it was great. Alot of bacon on it. Gravy was a perfect thickness.  My husband had a Chilly Cheese Dog. He ate it all pretty sure he loved it.  Again will be returning.  I've had alot of Poutine and was craving for a good one, thought I'd give this place a try and I'm glad we did.  The guy working there was very pleasant, polite. Good customer service"}
{"text":"Drove down Main St. Brampton and saw a big sign that read Poutine on the green sign. Had to stop by and check it out myself.  Place looks nice and tidy with friendly staff.  They had around 10 different flavors to pick from.  Poutine was very flavorful but a big drawback is that they don't use real cheese curds.  That is a big nono in my books for Poutine.  And pricing was pretty expensive for not real cheese curds. Around $12 after tax for the large.    My friend that live around the corner told me that is the only Poutine in the area so I guess they don't have much competitor to face off against."}
{"text":"After reading the reviews and bookmarking this place ages ago I was more than a little excited when my Brampton travels found me at the front door of Poutine Dare To Be Fresh.  The location is less than a block away from the intersection of Queen and Main St, and from a branding position, I love the lime green coloured smiley face which greets you at every corner. I think the concept is pretty cool...  Unfortunately their name is about the only thing Fresh I encountered. I should preface this review by stating I can't speak to if this is the \"normal\" practice or merely I caught them on an off day. This review speaks only about what I was served yesterday.  I ordered the following: - Montreal Smoked Meat Sandwich which came with a pickle - Local fave, Bacon Double Cheeseburger Poutine  To begin, the sandwich meat came in a single serving plastic bag which was microwaved to warm it up. Having had pre - packaged Montreal smoked meat here in the GTA before I know it should be warmed up Sous-vide style inside the bag in a hot water bath. What was worse was the sandwich was tossed together on remnants of rye bread which by the time I opened my wrapped package, had crumbled and gotten soaked through for the grease of the meat brought on by the microwave.  I didn't finish it....  The sandwich came with a 1/2 pickle, I LOVE the fresh snap of a good pickle so I asked if I might have a second to go along with my lunch. That was no problem so I was thrilled to see two MASSIVE pickle halves waiting for me with my sandwich. The pickles however had no snap, were overly pickled to the point of being mushy. I typically don't spit out my food but after trying a bite of each pickle I had to spit it out and get rid of them....  Lastly, I decided that the poutine was the reason for really coming here and so i shouldn't really judge them too harshly on things they don't specialize in. That said I was disappointed with the \"freshness\" of my order. The fries were not made to order, they were simply scrapped together from the remnants of the two previous orders, so my fries were lukewarm not hot and crisp. The gravy tasted alright and the rest of the toppings were good as well. I did however have an issue with the cheese sauce being served from a pump, I've had this at other joints and they've served it from a warming pot with a ladle. To their credit, I did appreciate that they layered the poutine (fries + cheese + gravy, followed by more fries + cheese + gravy) without being asked. ALSO, unlike trips to Smokes, I ate the poutine and didn't feel terrible afterward!  I'd gladly come back and try this spot out again (that's why my 2 stars are always open to a second chance) but I hope management addresses the gaps in their freshness offering.  Eatcrest Out"}
{"text":"Our 1st time and it wad great! They were very helpful and super friendly! Poutine was amazing. We went with the loaded anf buffalo chicken. Definitely will be there again!."}
{"text":"Not recommended for families ... had a hard time explaining all the f-bombs in the music that was being played to my 8 year old daughter.  That said they did accommodate when I asked if they had something less explicit.  Food was marginal ... perhaps I'm spoiled with Montreal poutine.  My 8 year who begged me to take her there said it was 'ok' with a smirk.  I had the butter chicken poutine .... don't recommend mixing butter chicken with gravy and cheese curds.    If you stick with the basics you might like it."}
{"text":"I may be slightly generous with my rating, but it's it's based simply on this: their poutine. Others reviews have rightfully mentioned that their non-poutine items are only fair (or worse). The one time I ordered their chilli dog it certainly didn't exceed average.  BUT, as their name not-so subtly suggests - they're about poutine, and doing it fresh. The half dozen or so times I've been here and ordered the poutine, the (fresh-cut) fries were made to order. Freshness: achieved. It's done with proper cheese curd and they also tier it properly, with a layer of curd and gravy in the middle as well. Poutine: as it should be.  They offer nearly a dozen or so options for the poutine. To be honest, I can't really comment on them since I've only ever gone for the classic. I like how there's a number of options for the condiments and I learned that I really enjoy a bit of diced pickles in it as a result.  Nice decor inside and lots of seating. Service has always been great.  My advice: give it a try, but \"dare to be\"...predictable. Stick with the poutine."}
{"text":"I came to Canada with a vague idea of this 'poutine' thing with fries and gravy. Thanks to a coworker, I left Poutine Date to Be Fresh with a full understanding of the poutine.   This is a poutinerie, and you should only get your favorite poutine of poutines --diets come here to die. I had a Great Canadian poutine -- bacon, caramelized onions and mushrooms crowned my basket of fries and gravy. Its huge, its salty, its messy, its poutine in all its glory. The large portion sizes are pretty large and can be a meal and snack for later. My only complaint is that there is no alcohol served here.  The place is located on Main facing the street, and you will need to find street parking in the area. There's plenty around the neighborhood but you may need to pay if you come for lunch (I think its free parking after 6)."}
{"text":"Just pile on the toppings and the gravy. Smother me in hot sauce and sour cream...deep fry all that artery clogging goodness. Roll me out in a wheelbarrow and just leave me.  ......thats how good this place is.  Just go. Go now."}
{"text":"Prepare yourself my Canadian friends: I don't LOVE poutine..... But before you come to my door with pitch forks, I have to admit it's the best leisure food ever...which I treat myself once every couple of years perhaps? I came drawn by the large green smiley face and with high hopes that the \"Dare to be Fresh\" on the logo meant that someone had finally invented a semi healthy version of poutine.  But...no...it was still as deliciously unhealthy as poutine I've had elsewhere. OK I admit, probably \"healthier\" than food truck poutine. This place gets no big award for name creativity, but they do keep it simple and to the point.  It's clean and well maintained and while they had only one guy working, he could have been fresh out of high school but managed to work the register and whip out poutines with efficiency and an attitude that indicated he liked working there. With a few seats in front of a flat screen playing the Jays game I would have loved to plop down there with my food if I had the time. My poutine was fine, it was fresh in that it was still too hot to eat, so I had to let it cool for a while and I would say probably one of the better poutines I've had (I haven't tried any fancy gourmet stuff from restaurants though).  They have a large menu (in size and variety) from which to choose from and also the condiments stand was well stacked with interesting options and I didn't hesitate in piling my poutine with jalapeños (it's really the little things in life that make me happy). My only hiccup is that the prices could be lower.  So in 2 years, when I venture out to slowly kill myself with poutine I would love to come back here and see what other exciting fresh condiments they provide for my enjoyment!"}
{"text":"I thought that the gravy of McD's poutine is the best until a friend and I stumbled upon this place. We were on a hunt for 'out of the usual cousine' downtown Brampton for lunch and with a disappointment of not finding anything, we just walked in to \"Poutine\" at 20 Main St S, Brampton, ON L6W 2C3. What a pleasant end to the hunt it was. A good choice of music, friendly staff, and amazing poutine. Now it is our Monday lunch."}
{"text":"Just tried the Vegetarian Poutine with Butternut Squash & Corn (without Sweet Peas), and added Caramelized Onions & Sautéed Mushrooms. It was a crazy combination for poutine, but surprisingly worked really well with the Cheese Curds & Rich Dark Gravy! Comfortable & cozy ambience, warm & friendly service, and delicious & satisfying food -- what an awesome combination! Thanks to Graham & Chris for the personal attention and accommodating welcome! :)"}
{"text":"When you are craving Poutine... this is the place to be.  I came here with three other people on a random Tuesday around 2pm.  I went to their register and ordered for everyone.  We all shared the following and their description:  Breaded Dill Pickle Spears ($5)- An order was five pieces.  They were perfectly breaded, seasoned, and fried.  I really enjoyed them and they are a perfect snack.    Bacon Double Cheeseburger ($14/Large)-  This was monstrous and insane.  You can get a small, medium or large.  We went with a large and ended up not finishing it.  It consisted of lean ground beef, bacon and cheese sauce.  It was smothered with goodness.    The Dead Ringer ($10)-  This was my favorite since I love onion rings.  It was perfectly fried onion rings, rich gravy, and cheese curds.  It was basically a classic poutine but in onion ring version.  Its a must get if you are an onion ring fan.    It was about $35 for our entire order I mentioned plus one lemon grapefruit soft drink.  Between the four of us, we couldn't finish it all.  Everything was delicious.  I appreciated the many variety of poutines they had on their menu.  So many options!  As for service, the guy and girl working there were really nice and our food came out fast.  I like that they had condiments such as ketchup, jalapenos and onions on the side so you can help yourself.  This place is super causal.  You order at the register and they call you when your food is ready.  The inside is pretty small.  There are only a few tables.  It's definitely worth checking out if you love poutine and are in the area."}
{"text":"Had an amazing 2nd date with myself on another visit. They have it down, it's entirely delicious."}
{"text":"So, I've eaten here quite a few times and I'll try to keep this organized.  Design/Appearance:   Poutine Dare to be fresh has  a great looking facade with a sliding glass front so you can enjoy those warm summer days.  The interior has trendy bar stools which have those pneumatic gas deals to adjust to your weight.  Also the exposed brick and good lighting are a nice feature as well.  The place is very clean and asthetically pleasing.  I'd give a 5 out of 5 in this respect.  There is also free wifi and outlets available at the location for customers.  Food:  I've had several variety's of poutine here as well as their chili.  I find the pricing to be quite good actually.  A Basic 16oz poutine will run you 4.99 and the 24oz 5.99.  Chili is a real steal at 3.99 for a regular and 4.99 for a large.  The toppings for the Poutine are awesome and fresh.  Everything from pulled pork, butter chicken  to sundried tomatoes.  The owner's told me he try's to source as much as he can locally and you can really taste it in the food.  The fries are golden brown and the cheese curds are just epic.  I suggest the loaded poutine, it's your basic poutine with a thick cut bacon, a couple dolops of sour cream and fresh chives.  And it's presentation is excellent.  Even for the veg lover there is a veggie based gravy and plenty of veggie toppings to choose from.  I've also had one of his farmer market type deserts, a butter tart to be exact.  It was epic, a good size for the money, plenty of rasins, and the crust wasn't over baked so it crumbled nicely in my mouth.   They have plenty of cold drinks to select from as well as salads and ready made sandwiches.  Their chocolate milk though is excellent.  Way better than the Beatrice brand seen practically everywhere.  It's probably one of my favorites.  Overall I'd say food was excellent and for the price you can't go wrong.  Customer Service:  These guys are just amazing.  The owner Graham is always there and he remembers your name.  Just real quality people.  Interested in engaging their customer base.  Food is served pretty damn fast.  So no issues that way!"}
{"text":"Well executed poutine, good gravy, ignore the fancy.  When you walk in off Main, you're surprised that a fries-and-gravy joint looks so sharp. Nice wooden bar-height tables, leather stools, good lighting and attractive decor is more than one would expect. The people behind the counter are really friendly; the place has a nice feel.  They follow the now familiar formula for poutine shops - offer the basics at a reasonable price, upsell you on special additions. In this case, their small and large basic poutine run 4.99 and 6.99 respectively and are good portions for that price. The add ons include the expected pulled pork, sauteed mushrooms, and thick cut bacon and well as some curve-balls like butternut squash and sun-dried tomatoes.  Focus, young yelper. Their basic poutine is what earns them the four stars. Fresh cut fries cooked properly. A good, rich beef gravy. Proper curds, and they layer things well (fries-curds-gravy-fries-curds-gravy) instead of just dumping some cheese and gravy on top and leaving the bottom fries unloved. It's a solid offering.  The addons are a distraction - thrown on at the end as though the staff has learned nothing from their own careful layering. Overpriced, too, compared to the value of the basic deal.  Pro-tip: KISS. Keep it simple, smartypants. Poutine. Period. End of sentence. If you do this, you're in a 4-star poutine joint. If you don't, you're on your own."}
{"text":"Been here few times already.. came here with my significant other and the rest of the times with my kids..   Location is go pretty good it's in front of the city hall and close to a park so if you wanna enjoy the nice weather outside you can ask for it to be to go  and eat it at gage park.. there's not much space in the actual place so it's  it recommended for big groups.  Staff here are always friendly today we had a gentleman who was very friendly esp towards our 1 year old daughter they interacted with her every time she would smile at them..  Food wise I always choose the MEXICANA just because I am a fan of Mexican food.. has the meat salsa sour cream guacamole  cheese and also had the regular cheese curds and gravy so you get a savoury and fresh taste.. fries are always made at the time of order.. so you get nice warm crispy fresh fries which I think is a plus esp for a poutine.   Overall I would say this place is doing pretty good since they are still there and food wise my personal opinion is good can they make more combinations I think they can bit we would have to wait and see"}
{"text":"I've been here twice with wagjag vouchers in hand, both times were quite different...  1st experience was with hubby and we got a classic poutine (normally 4.99/6.99) with two montreal steamies  (normally $2.49 each- hot dogs with coleslaw- we got them naked instead) I thought we were able to order 2 toppings or one of their special poutine but the girl at the cash said no, unless we opt out of the hot dogs :s never heard of that before. None the less a poutine is a poutine...is a poutine lol so we stuck with original! The complementary condiments bar is close to the ones you'll find at any hot dog stand, but with a few extras like cayenne pepper, and curry, bbq sauce (YUM)  The hot dogs were basic but the poutine was rly yummy, i saw them making the fries fresh and they were crisy and the gravy was actually pretty yummy (not the best I have had- hello montreal) but it was tasty. The girls was nice and there was only another couple there when we came.  I like the bar stools type set up they have with high tables, but my hubby definitely was not a fan. he felt like he was going to fall off lol needless to say they are not for hanging out more than an hour before your back starts to hurt type chairs.  Second experience: was with my sister, her fiance, and my mommy (lol somehow got her to come along) A few more guests this time around.  We got the same coupon this time but now I think the owner, was behind the bar and he said I could get two toppings on top of the classic or pick a specialty one- I KNEW I WAS RIGHT LAST TIME! Lol I got bacon and mushrooms, which was really good but I didn't finish since my mom wasn't much help. Their cheese curds are good and melt a little bit, just enough to not overbear the gravy but tags along for the ride lol  The steamies this time around was really off, the hotdog itself was bigger than last time BUT the bread, it was soggy and squished and just not a good texture, my sister ate the hot dog sans bread because of this. We saw the guy take it out of the freezer and microwave it, I get the need to be \"fresh\" hence the name but if you realize the bun looked or felt wet and mushed up, why would you serve it like it was okay? :s that threw me off, my sister also got the classic with smoked meet and caramelized onions (YUMMY) $7.99/$9.99 normally.   They also have soup, sandwiches (still to come) and desserts with a range of drinks. Huge amount of toppings to purchase with the freis including olives, chicken, pulled pork, ground beef, squash???, sun dried tomatoes, sweet peas and olives.  Over all I think they have to have more consistency with the food and price knowledge. BUT their customer service is really great, they were friendly, helpful and for a order-at-the-counter type, really interacted with us. If I am in the area I will go back for their poutine but will be apprehensive to try their steamies again, without the coupon!   Overall: Customer Service 5* Poutine 4* Steamies 2*  They also have branded merchandise which is for sure a montrealers thing lol"}
{"text":"Tried this place with a friend. Decided to just get a regular poutine t judge how they treat their product before sampling anything else. The fries were a bit salty, though not overbearing, and the cheese curds and gravy were pretty delicious! Overall, I definitely would give them a second chance though I am not really ever in downtown Brampton to begin with! Great place if poutine is all you want!"}
{"text":"One of the best restro i ever went to...  Ambience was breath taking.. i am very foodie kind of person and this place fulfilled my expectations.  Taste was yummm!!! I mean it was heavenly l!!  For sure one of my fav. Restro these days!"}
{"text":"First time having poutine was fresh hot and very tasty... It's also filling... Great first time.."}
{"text":"1st time experience at poutine dare to be fresh. By far the best poutine i've ever had with generous portions. I've ordered bbq pork bursting with flavour. Layered fries, cheese curds with tons of gravy hits the spot. Reasonably priced, wish management would address the pricing more clearly. Sm: $7.99, reg: $9.99  xl: 12.99. Crazy busy joint in small welcoming atmosphere. Def place worth checking out, highly recommend! Can't wait to dive in again."}
{"text":"I think its over priced. Like you cant even get a combo.  26$ for 2 small poutines and over mustard sandwich smoked meat"}
{"text":"Delicious and quick service. Duck was cooked perfectly, onion ring poutine was epic, as was the classic poutine. Overall great experience. We will be returning to try the other items on their menu. Service was quick and friendly."}
{"text":"Crazy good poutine spot.  Love my poutine.....but only if it is done right.  This place nailed it.  Fries are perfect and sturdy, don't get soggy with the gravy and toppings.  Great varieties to choose from.  I am a Smoke's snob and was skeptical when my colleague suggested we try this spot instead but am so glad that we did.  Give it a shot, you will not be disappointed.  For Yelpers, Yelp says they open at 10:30, they in fact open at 11.  We arrived at 10:50 and the owner was friendly enough to let us in early.  Thank you Sir!!  We will be back!!"}
{"text":"Not so good. I went here with a group on. I thought the hot dogs were nothing special the small kind too wow. And the poutine was one of the worst I have had. On a good note the owner was very nice and friendly and really appreciated my business"}
{"text":"Love the Poutine from here! Tried many places in Toronto but I would have to say this is the best I've had. There's a few other creative ones but I love their Bacon, Sourcream, and Chive combo! As a Toronto girl, moving to Brampton, I thought I would be missing out but this place really delivers! Just tried Smokes and it can't compare."}
{"text":"The Hungry Gills hit this place up last Saturday. It was our second time here, but our last time was about a couple years ago. We had a hankerin' for some poutine and didn't want to hit up a franchise store (New York Fries/Smokes). We wanted something with some Brampton flavour to it.  We got there around 2:30PM on a Saturday. The place was empty, which was perfect for our video review --- Just it was a bit too loud to hear our voices on camera (no complaints here, we love hip-hop).   The menu at Dare to be Fresh is extensive, lots and lots of variety.   Karn ordered: 1) Buffalo Chicken Poutine  2) Chili Cheese Dog Neetu ordered 1) Mexicana Poutine (sans beef)  Buffalo Chicken Poutine (Medium- $11) The fries are nothing to go home and brag about. Pretty standard fries here, good length and width with a softness to it (Karn isn't a fan of crunchy/crispy fries -- so this is a good thing). The gravy was good. Rich flavour while being nice and thick. The curds did not melt though, which leads us to believe that the gravy wasn't at an optimal temperature, although the fries and other toppings were fresh and hot. On top of this base of a regular poutine was about 3-4 chicken tender pieces and a 2-3 spoons of buffalo sauce. What Karn really enjoyed was the amount of chicken in the poutine, they definitely did not skimp out on it! This was all served with a side of blue cheese sauce to give it a wings and fries feel. If you like chicken and you like fries, this is a good choice.  Mexicana Poutine (Medium - $11)  Neetu enjoyed the fries, she liked the thickness and cuts of em'. The Mexicana is the classic poutine loaded with fresh guacomole, salsa and sour cream. Neetu ordered it without the lean ground beef. The guacamole was delicious --chipotle esque (which is god like lol). Neetu really enjoyed the guac/sour cream combo with the classic poutine. She said she wouldn't get it again though simply for the reason that they have so much variety -- you kinda want to try all of them.  Chili Cheese Dog $4.75 The dog was recommended to be eaten with a fork and knife due to the sheer mess it is to eat it, but Karn went hands in. The dog is a mess to eat without utensils (no regrets here still). The bun is nice and soft and the dog was juicy and hot (win-win!). The short coming was the actual chili and cheese. The cheese did not melt (seemed like some Tex Mex you would get from the grocery store), and the chili was beyond underwhelming. The chili had zero kick to it and was if anything sweet rather than adding some heat to the dog. Karn would not recommend getting it.  Environment notes:  They do play hip hop music which does contain vulgar languange, which might be a turn off for parents --- just get the food to go rather than dining in (but then the fries get soggy! ahhhh decisions..). The weather was good so they had windows open and wasps were swarming in and disrupting Neetu, which was not cool.   BOTTOM LINE These guys got Cherry Coke!! which place has Cherry Coke nowadays!? Karn almost teared up when he saw they had it available. The poutine is delicious, and a medium portion is quite large even for a big guy like Karn. Don't get the dog, use the money on something else. We came out of there paying $35 for the both of us with our stomachs STUFFED --- which is pretty decent value. Check the place out if you wanna try some funky poutines. Our cravings were satisfied, we are going to lay off the poutine for a bit now lol   We did a full video review if you care to check it out, hope you enjoy it and subscribe.

{"text":"LOVE this place. My husband loves their bacon double cheeseburger poutine and I'm a huge fan of their chili cheese steamie. Nice casual restaurant but tables need to be wiped more often which is really the only negative I have."}
{"text":"The poutines looked very nice. Fried done fresh to order.. However my boyfriend and I both suffered from food poisoning shortly after we finished our meal and left! Perhaps the improperly stored meat was the culprit? Only one guy working at the time and he seemed more focused on taking personal calls and stepping outside every few minutes to speak to a strange guy lingering by the door...   Open to trying again. Hopefully the second experience will be much better than the first!"}
{"text":"I saw this place on a Yelp list of poutineries in the GTA, and since we were in Brampton and I like poutine, we decided to give it a try.  They also have steamies, which are Montreal's signature style of hot dog: steamed weiner on a steamed bun, with mustard, onion, and in this case a lightly pickled cabbage. It's pretty small, but I also ordered a regular size classic poutine to go along with it, and that combination made for a filling lunch.  The poutine was good - with fresh fries, good beefy gravy, and a good amount of cheese curds.  Lee decided to go with The Montrealer poutine, which was poutine with smoked meat and mustard in addition to gravy. I took a sample and although it's not quite as good as the version that my local place (Allen Street Poutine) it was still tasty.  I have seen in previous reviews complaints that things didn't seem to be the freshest, I will have to say that when we were there, everything was fresh, the fries were nice and crispy when not covered in gravy, and everything was quite yummy.  The owner is very nice and definitely a go-getter, he gave us some free samples of cookies when we were on the way out, and if I hadn't been so stuffed, I would have gotten a couple!"}
{"text":"Too pricey for a subpar poutine. Tried the ones with pulled pork & it tasted weird. I've had better poutine at New York Fries."}
{"text":"Nice little late night eat. Courteous staff members and decent food. We got hot dogs and poutine. Nice variety available for the poutine including vegetarian options."}
{"text":"Don't be fooled by this place!  Terrible!  Expensive!  Cheap on ingredients!  Among the worst dry poutine I have ever eaten, I'm from Montreal, I know poutine and I know it's not fair to compare to authentic Montreal poutine.  You go in with such high expectations since they have a lovely menu and you come out with a poutine lacking ingredients to essentially call it a poutine.  I'm sure the great reviews are fake, I've given this place more than it's fair share of tries but in the last year or so every time they fail badly, it's just more frustrating and wasteful (dry poutine fit for the trash can) than it's worth. Most of the staff, specifically the manager, are extremely rude and I believe not properly trained.  Do yourself a favour and go to The Works, you can get a great burger, fries and acceptable service for about the same price.   Pics to follow."}
{"text":"Poutine might be the perfect drunk food... but it might not be a good idea for a half drunk cannot think clear poutine rookie to order here.  In my moment of weakness and my Yelp poutine expert friend on his washroom break, I randomly ordered a \"Ducked Up\" poutine which is Poutine Dare to Be Fresh seasonal special.  I have to admit it was all my fault, I didn't read the description till now:  \"Our Classic Poutine Topped with Lean Pulled Duck Meat, Caramelized Onions Kissed with a Sweet Orange Marmalade\"  The sweet, sour and savoury combination definitely not working. Sadly even the Classic Poutine base was off without the use of real cheese curds and there were barely any cheese strings. The fries itself was pretty good though.  I guess I should have stayed with the Classic Poutine from now on.   We packed the leftover to go and sadly it was still sitting at the back of the fridge... I guess it is not so fresh anymore.."}
{"text":"Had my first poutine here and I'm not disappointed. You can add toppings for an additional charge. Relish, pickles, jalapenos, onions, ketchup can also be added."}
{"text":"Amazing service and legit poutine. Arrived with group at 1130pm and they were so happy to serve us.  Everyone loved their grub and jad a blast. Montrealer and fried pickles a must!"}
{"text":"I was in town on business and wanted to have an authentic Poutine experience. Found Poutine Date To Be Fresh here on Yelp and decided to give them a try.  Tucked away on the main strip in town, it's the kind of place you might find on Diners, Drive-In's and Dives. The staff was instantly welcoming and friendly and my dish was made to order.   The food did not disappoint! It was fantastic! I had the Bacon Cheeseburger Poutine and...just wow.   Do yourself a favor and check this place out and keep them going.  I hope to be back in town soon and this will be on my list of places to have dinner again, for sure."}
{"text":"this is the BEST poutine place in Brampton.  the owner came into my work looking for parts.  ever since he recommended i try this place i've been hooked.  i cannot come to brampton without eating at this place absolutely amazing flavors  and amazing variety, the price is a little bit high so far as poutine standards go, but the flavor is amazing.  highly recommend, no complaints  p.s. i just saw a picture of the \"ducked up\" poutine and im jealous i never had the chance to try it!"}
