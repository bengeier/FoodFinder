{"text":"Have been wanting to try this place and finally stopped down this afternoon. The bar was full, and three tables of people on the enclosed porch. We chose a table on the porch and looked over the menu, waiting about 10 minutes with no service. 

So, we moved to the small table in the bar, hoping to be noticed by Bob (the owner, who was busy at the bar but also occasionally serving dishes to the folks in the dining room) or one of the two servers. Eye contact was made a few times, and we even waved a hand to signal that we'd like to be served, but they actively avoided acknowledging us. 

After waiting another ten minutes or so, we gave up and left. Super disappointing. We waited very patiently for almost 20 minutes, trying to give them the benefit of the doubt; maybe they'd already made enough money this afternoon. There were a lot of shots being poured at the bar - perhaps if we'd have made friends with those folks, we'd have been noticed. 


I've had Bob's giardienara (which is *delicious*, and I intended buy some to bring some home) and was psyched to eat at the new location in Braddock, but I'be got a really bad taste in my mouth (well, none, actually) after today's experience. Sad face."}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere!  Good prices too.
Cool patio with live music (at times).

We got vegetarian stuffed banana peppers and I actually thought they made a mistake and brought the sausage version they were so good. Spice level was perfect. Huge portions too. Menu has tons of options. Believe me, everyone you know will find something they like.

I was just there but already craving to go back."}
{"text":"I've been hearing great things about this place for weeks so, today my wife and I met my brother here. Our family is Braddock born and raised for a couple generations. We live in the suburbs now but,I love checking out new life in town. This place is great. I'm going to keep this simple. Great food, great prices, good beer selection and Jessica, our server, really got our smart ass sense of humor. 
We'll be back again and again. Yinz guyz will love it. ( they'll get the 5th star after I finish eating everything on the menu)"}
{"text":"Just had the best chicken salad sandwich on a toasted pretzel bun.  4$ beer special. What a great place for lunch."}
{"text":"Great food, great prices, great service.  Friendly owner who is passionate about preparing and serving high quality products.  Different specials daily.  Nice clean quiet place.  I'll be back many times."}
{"text":"Wow! Why have we not been here before now? This place will become one of our go to places no doubt! Lovely patio seating with bocce and corn hole games makes this a great place to gather with friends. 

Food is very very good. We love the stuffed banana peppers. Amazing red sauce for all their Italian dishes has a bit of a kick and is delicious. The chicken Parm and meatballs were reported as tasty, but that Italian beef was outstanding! Their special gardenia peppers make this an extra special delight. Try the Italian beef fries, you will thank me. I wish they made this in a nacho version with chips (\"hint hint\").

We plan on trying many dishes here as we will be going back for sure."}
{"text":"The service is terrible. I called in an order and was told it would be ready in 15 minutes. I went in 20 minutes and waited 25 minutes for my food. No explanation until I asked and was told the crab was in the oven. I asked for my money back - cause they had time to ring it up after 10 minutes. Handed me my food - No apology - nothing.
Now the food - the crab cake that took so long wad a piece of moosh- terrible. The seafood gumbo is sooo salty I cannot eat it. I threw everything away and $15.00 later - no lunch."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful time here. The patio was packed. The Italian beef sandwiches were delicious.  The owner greeted us and told us of his famous Giardinera served with the sandwiches. Also available for purchase. Then the surprise of live music which they have several nights a week. Relaxing, friendly and very enjoyable. Will be back with some friends later this month. Best of luck to \"Peppers\"."}
{"text":"I was in the mood for a Chicago style Italian beef combo sandwich. I saw that this place made their own giardiniera, so I decided to give it a try. 

It was decent, but if you're expecting authentic Chicago beef, you'll be severely disappointed.

First, the beef is shredded roast beef, not sliced. Secondly, they put red sauce on it without asking.  The giardiniera comes in plastic ramekins, so you can put as much or as little as you want on your sandwich.

I will say the Italian sausage served in the Combo was very good. We asked whether they made it on site or sourced locally, but our server didn't know.

The red sauce was also very good, so food served with it might be better. Decent number of beer taps as well.

Worth checking out as long as you don't want a Chicago Italian beef sandwich."}
{"text":"Today, I had the tripe di Porto and the ham hocks
With black eyed peas and greens. Yum yum yum! Nothing here is ever even close to being bad! All is worth trying."}
{"text":"I thought this place would be better. Cole slaw was very spicy not cream based. Waitress was not friendly. I thought it would be more homemade, but tasted like frozen prepared food that was put together. Nothing special, and to top it off my friend had a hair on her plate! I would not recommend!"}
{"text":"I have been to this place many times. The food is always delicious and the beer cold. They have a great selection on beers on tap. The menu is primarily \"meaty\" but it's all good. My favorite is the meatball sub. My husband gets the Chicago Italian Beef with giardinar, made by Portogallos. Yummy place for lunch, dinner, and happy hour."}
{"text":"What a great spot! Great food and enthusiastic service, what a great combination.  I got meat balls n the Italian beef sandwiches. They were excellent. There is a dining area and a small bar. What else do u need? I'm a customer there forever."}
{"text":"Was in town for HS reunion and tried the Kamikaze as it is compared to the Triangle Bar Destroyer. Had both a Day apart and my favorite was the Triangle Bar Destroyer. The bread used with the Kamikaze is bland and does not taste like the Italian bread used by Triangle. The meat tasted bland as well compared to the meat used by Triangle. Maybe I'm used to the taste of Triangle Bar sandwiches as I've been going there every time I'm in town for some 50 years, but my choice for an Italian hoagie will be Triangle Bar hands down."}
{"text":"Peppers N'at is a wonderful addition to Braddock.  Formerly located in Swissvale, this new location offers a small bar area, dining area, and patio.  The menu has had a few minor changes but still revolves around sandwiches. 

The location is conveniently located near the Rankin Bridge. Parking can be an issue on busier days but typically is fine. The building itself is very clean and seems to be new or at least newly renovated. 

The food is fantastic and the portions are generous. I go with the Chicken Parmigiana sandwich and it is delicious! The sauce has a kick to it, it's super thick and hearty also. I know those who I've dined with enjoyed the Monongahela Meat Monster and Hot Sausage sandwich. 

I look forward to returning to try the pizza and wings, both of which I've heard good things. If you're driving by the area this spot is definitely worth checking out. If you live in this area, and are not dining here then you are seriously missing out!"}
{"text":"Beer selection is pretty good, but each time I have been here the service was slow which probably made the food cold.  Also, it seems like every time we are here they are having some kind of facebook reunion or get together for a local group.  I can see maybe once a month, but out of the 6 times we visited, it was the same deal.  Much better choices in Homestead."}
{"text":"Dinner tonight on the closed in patio.  Meatballs and blast furnace sandwich was great.  Stuffed banana peppers were great but really spicy.  Great if you can handle it.  Sadly I couldn't.   Wait staff was very attentive and sweet.  Owner was very personable.   We'll be back again for sure.  Wish there were more entrees on the menu (i.e. Lasagna or stuffed shells)."}
{"text":"I will be back to make sure my experience wasn't the norm.  First the beer selection is great!!  But much of the food was not served hot enough. The stuffed pepper appetizer has hot sauce but it appears the pepper and stuffing are made ahead.  They were just warmed and not well enough.    Same thing with the cheese on my sandwich.    Maybe next time I will try pizza because you know they cook it when you order.   I so want this place to make it    I hope they correct these issues"}
{"text":"I just like the vibe of this place.  Good food and I buy the giardenia to go.  I have been there twice and both timea I enjoyed my sandwich.

Just an FYI, the fries are gigantic and almost like a wedge in size.  I frankly have never seen fries like that before and they are hard to explain.  I didnt love them but the sandwich and beer selection mkre than make up for the fries.  Love that it is a local place too .

I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"What a great addition to Braddock!  I've been here three times so far over the past few days and I'll be back again. They have a very good beer selection (two hard to find European beers, Bavik Super Pils and Okocim Lager) and a better than average bar food menu. I've had the Chicken Parm Sandwich and the stuffed peppers. They were both served up quickly, the portions were plentiful, and the quality was delicious. Pepper's N'at has a cozy feel to it and it's big enough, with the attached patio (closed in for the winter months), where as you don't feel cramped. 

But what sets this place apart has definitely got to be the people. Bob, the proprietor, can be found on the floor pleasantly conversing with the customers when he's not in the back cooking.  The last time I was in, he brought out homemade chips for everyone to sample.  Then there's the bar staff. Lisa and Jeanna take pride in their pours, will remember your name and go the extra effort to make you feel welcome.  And police and military veterans are treated to a 10% discount on food AND alcohol. 

So now, in addition to the Brew Gents down the street, there's another reason to cross the Rankin Bridge and visit \"Historic Braddock\"."}
{"text":"This is a great hidden spot in Braddock that my BF introduced me to. Great \"higher end\" bar food with a homemade touch. The menu offers a lot of variety. The Chicken Eggplant Parmesan sandwich and fresh cut fries are some of the best I've had. The service needs a bit of work if you're not seated at the bar. It was too slow on our last visit that we ended up canceling our appetizer after waiting 40 minutes for it. Luckily, the waitress took the stuffed peppers off of our bill and sent them home with us to compensate for the extreme delay. Bobby the owner does bring in some great jazz singers/bands which is a nice touch for a summer night on the patio."}
{"text":"Strolling on Braddock Ave I stumbled into the place because as a kid I was always curious to what was inside as it used to be Jimmy's Donuts. The space itself takes a minimalist approach to decorating and it's quite cramped. I'm glad I took my order to go. The staff did mention enclosing the patio soon but until then you might want to stay inside and just feel in the way because I rather be crowded than cold. Now to the food... Their prices are awesome sauce. I got a chicken parm sandwich and a Redd's Apple Ale for a decent price and you get a lot of food. Me and my mom split the sandwich and still didn't eat it all. I love that it was a different take on a chicken parm and it was more of a sub than a sandwich. For the most part the staff is friendly. One of the bartenders seemed frustrated that we were in the way because it was crowded,  we had nowhere to stand that was out of the way and I just chalked it up to her being overwhelmed. This place doesn't have much competition when it comes to eateries as Braddock is a bit of a food desert but if it was the middle of the night and I was in the mood for Italian,  I would give this place a go. I just couldn't eat it every day. It's good but it's not that darn good. Glad to see some new faces and businesses coming to Braddock. Triangle Bar and Grill though will forever be at the top of my list of the best subs in The Rust Belt."}
{"text":"If your like the old Italian sandwich similar to Tootie's on the Southside or Old School in Homestead you are probably going to like Portogallo.  Good bread with some good Italian beef, but the the giardiniera makes the difference.  Good sauce with a little bit of heat but not to much served in a cup so you can decide how much to use.  Use it all, it is a large sandwich and the giardiniera is what makes it so good.  You can buy the giadiniera in bottles/jar to take home along with some local t-shirts.  
Will have to come back and try the Italian taco.  
Service was friendly, we were so busy talking that I forgot to take a picture of my sandwich.
The shop is small with just a few tables and about six seats at a counter."}
{"text":"Been wanting to try this place out for awhile. Stopped in for lunch got seated in the dining area which is an addition on the building with plastic walls with a cold draft blowing in. Nice set up for the summer time but on the cold side for winter. They were out of a lot of things on the menu. I got the Italian beef sandwhich as my choices were limited. Took awhile to get out drinks and our order. Other people in the dining room were complaining of the wait also. Waitress was lackadaisical as I'm sitting in my work clothes on lunch break there was no rush to get me in and out... she was pleasant though. Took way to long for the food to come out, we're talking about a Italian beef sandwhich come on now!! So I finally bite into my sandwhich, it was good .... way to long of a wait during my lunch break . I'll try back in a few months"}
{"text":"What a find in Braddock. A authentic Chicago beef sandwich in the 'Burg. Anyone familiar with Chicago will know how great this sandwich is. 

Other menu items always are suburb. Definitely worth the trip. 

Now jazz and entertainment, a great destination. 

Get there soon. You will love it. 

Henry"}
