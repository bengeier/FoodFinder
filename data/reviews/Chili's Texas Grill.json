{"text":"Avoid if you hate being frustrated...  Brought my 4 year old for a quick bite.  Literally 1 table occupied in the entire place.  Staff including two managers kept running by trying to figure out sections.  The occupied table turned out to be employees, who had an opinion of the sections, but little desire to help.  I tried to sit on the empty self seating section, but was evicted because my daughter wasn't 21...  Ten full minutes later we left for the place next door."}
{"text":"Been coming here with my family at least 6 years. So very surprised at the service ... Or lack of when we came in last night . 

Our drink order was at least 15mins. Our food order was 30 mins (ordered at time of drink order ) family across from us was there before we were and they didn't get their food until at least 10 mins after ours. 
I ordered sweet potato fries and the basket was half as full as my sons order. We asked if I could get more. The waiters complained a bit, then said she would. These never came ... (They did adjust the cheque) but it's not about money at this point. 

Back when our orders did come, the 2 waitresses that brought them out dropped them in front of us regardless of where our hands or utensils were. 

Not sure if we would go back. Not cheap , crappy service, small portions. Not sure why we would . Too bad , was one of our regular places."}
{"text":"Must be honest, after years of running restaurants and eating in a variety of them, the world over, this was by far the worst experience I have ever had. We had to wipe down or own table on the patio, the service incredibly slow, the waitress complacent and finally I had to get up to get our cutlery. Wow! It takes a lot to shake me up, but it was an upsetting experience. Even my children noticed. And all this on a quiet eve in the restaurant. I will not return. I've never written a negative review, but feel folks should know before making this choice."}
{"text":"I came in for dinner on a Tuesday night around 6:30 and was extremely disappointed with this new location. While the food was good, & our waitress was friendly, the restaurant was disgusting and seemed very understaffed. 

The floor was covered in squished french fries among other foods and that was not just under one table, nor was anything done about it in the hour and a half we were dining. The table beside us was also full of dirty dishes that were not touched from the time we arrived to the time we left. The fact that the parts of the restaurant in which customers are in are not kept clean is not only unsightly for those trying to enjoy a meal, but also makes you wonder how clean/sanitary the kitchen is.. Will be bringing our business back to the Southcentre location."}
{"text":"You would have to pay me to get me into a Chili's again.  The service is horrible.  The food SUCKS.  It's all this nasty tex-mex fusion junk.  No way!  Do yourself a favour and do not eat here."}
{"text":"Went there last night, will not be returning. Was told after the fact that it was the waitresses first night, but still didn't excuse the attitude she gave us when we ASKED for a drink refill: \"oh, alright\".  Sorry for the inconvenience! She didn't know what beer was on tap or soup (carry a cheat sheet if you don't know!).  Not once did she come during our meal to see how things were.  And it didn't stop there - food was horrible also.  Fries so salty no one could eat them, steak was way over well done like a hockey puck, veggies were soggy, meals incorrect and portions were a joke.  3 tiny fajita shells dished out, and of course no waitress to come back to serve more, so my husband only got to eat 1/3 of his meal.  Appetizers came after entrées were served.  Only saving grace was that the manager comped our meal, but still, there was SUCH a lack of service AND poor food quality, it was just a waste of time.  Had to come home a prepare a meal for my daughter because it was that bad.  Too bad, considering I've had the same meal at the one in the NE and it was phenomenal - never had issues there."}
{"text":"Great food. Good prices. Free dessert on your birthday if you sign up for their emails"}
{"text":"All was well until we got our meal- after that we were completely ignored by the waitress. She helped everyone in the isle except for us and another couple that was across from us. My husband ordered the 8oz steak and we were told it came with loaded mashed potatoes and \"fresh vegetables\"- he got this sad little scoop of what had to have been instant potatoes and the \"fresh vegetables\" consisted of three pieces of asparagus and two slices of red bell pepper. We weren't offered a top up on drinks, check to see if the food was okay and we had to hunt down the waitress to get steak sauce. 

The food was eatable at best but the service was amazingly poor."}
{"text":"After finding a $20 bill on the ground during a shopping excursion on 17th Avenue my boyfriend and I decided to use it for somewhat of a free meal at Chili's....however I wished we went elsewhere to spend the money. 

With the restaurant having two levels, the first level for families, we were directed to go upstairs to the lounge, where it was a much nicer and quieter atmosphere.  Upon sitting down, we were promptly given menus where we both ordered burgers (mine with a vegetarian patty).
I found the wait for food a little longer than necessary considering that it was just burgers and fries.  And once the food did arrive, it was \"meh\", I definitely had better food elsewhere.  I might have enjoyed the meal more, if I wasn't trying to sadly figure out the entire time if my patty was actually a veggie one.  I had the feeling that the chef may have forgotten to scrap off the grill before cooking mine as it had the odd aftertaste of beef.

Price wise, I was shocked at the bill as my boyfriend and I nearly racked 45 dollars.  So I was a little turned off by that but thanks to the freebie $20 bucks that we found earlier, I was happy to pay the remaining amount.
So to sum up all matters, I say to avoid this place and go elsewhere, as there are definitely other places better in the food and prices."}
{"text":"We were in town for Fallcon and running a bit behind so we decided to compromise sense and taste and eat at Chili's.  Don't get me wrong, I've had decent experiences at Chili's restaurants in the past, but with so many outstanding choices in Calgary it just wouldn't be at the top of my list.  

Oh wow, was this awful.  We sat down at a table and were handed menus that were filthy, sticky, and smeared with various substances.  I felt like I needed a hazmat suit and tweezers to be able to handle them safely.  Our interactions with the waitress could best be compared to your standard mosquito-human interaction.  She was constantly buzzing around our table before we ordered.  She gave us about 30 seconds look before asking us if we were ready, then about a minute, then maybe 2-3, then another 30 seconds, it became almost impossible to actually look at the menu because it felt like I was constantly putting it down to assure her we would order something.  She delivered most of our order quite a bit later.  My wife's food didn't arrive until the rest of us had finished eating.  The food was mostly lukewarm, my burger was undercooked, special instructions were not followed (like no onion, etc) and the waitress who had been like a fifth person at the table before our order was nowhere to be seen once we placed it.  We had to flag her down for the check.  

This was one of the worst dining experiences I've ever had.  The table was gross, the menus were filthy, the food was cold (my wife's chicken was refrigerator cold when she finally got it in a dish where that isn't supposed to be the case) and served in a disjointed way.  The waitress needed hospitality training, the meals were overpriced for what they were.. I just.. man.. please don't go here.  Just don't. 

In all fairness, we didn't give them an opportunity to remedy the situation.  I didn't contact management - we ate there because we were in a hurry and wanted to get to the convention.  I didn't want to waste the time it would take for them to have gotten the food right.  That and the condition of the table and menus told me this isn't a place where they're overly concerned about you having a pleasant experience.  We should have left as soon as we saw that sitting down, it was just a rough day and we wanted to get some food so we could move on."}
{"text":"I always go to this place when we go through the conversation \"Where do you want to go to eat tonight?\". And we are out of ideas. I always leave this place spending more than it is worth and feeling salty. I think they keep all the experienced wait people in the lounge where the tipping is more consistant and put the new  and grumpy servers in the general population. I often get the very fake smiles and weak attempts at small talk everytime I am there. It would be better if the just took the order, stopped pushing the alcohol and served the meal promptly. 

This sure sounds like a complaint, and I guess it is. I am comparing this place with the likes of Hard Rock Cafe service in Japan, California or Singapore and it does  not even come close."}
{"text":"Very disappointing. The wait time was very slow - even though the restaurant was only half full. We have 3 kids - their meals were sadly lacking.  The hamburgers came with just a bun - no asking if they wanted any toppings, condiments. Just dry bun with meat.  The Kraft Mac and cheese looked like the cheese had clumped on the macaroni - maybe added after macaroni was cold?  The enchilada was extremely dry and the half rack of ribs that were promised to be juicy were also very dry with little flavour. I asked for ketchup for the kids but actually used it to help moisten the ribs to make them easier to eat.  The Chili's chain used to be one of our favorite places to eat.  I am so disappointed in this experience."}
{"text":"Zero stars. Horrible experience. We asked for hot tea and got cold water, after waiting for forever our steak came and was definitely not even close to what we had ordered, it was basically all red and we wanted well done. So we waited again as the chef recooked it and it came back exactly the same. The waitress was like, \"what do you want me to do\" as if it was our fault that they couldn't get it right. The manager came over, not even apologetic in the least bit and reluctantly said that the steak only would be on the house. He asked if we wanted to wait some more as they recooked another steak. We had been waiting forever and the service just ruined the night for us. The manager never even checked back with us. We just wanted to get out of that place asap. It was my dad's birthday and they ruined it for us. We will definitely never come back to this location. I was telling my coworker and she also had a bad experience at this location. BEWARE."}
{"text":"We came here Friday night. Two of us ordered steak med rare. They both were very well done.  I ordered pasta and it was barely cooked. The server didn't seem to interested in us. We barely saw her. We defiantly won't be coming back."}
{"text":"I don't know if because it's a chain they think they can get away with poor service and bad food or if that's just part of the whole experience at all Chilis. If so, they exceeded expectations.
My girlfriend and I had to seat ourselves after asking the host if there were any tables upstairs. \"I don't know\", she said, brushing us off. After locating an upstairs table, the poor service continued. I had a NY steak and my girlfriend had a chicken wrap, which we were able to order after a waitress finally found us. The food was barely warm when it was served. I was hungry and ate the whole thing, but my girlfriend wanted to take half her sandwich home. This caused a lot of bad noise and we were told if we wanted to take anything to go, we could damn well box it up ourselves. The server mumbled something about \"health codes\" or something and brought us our very own styrofoam box to do with our left overs as we saw fit. It was crazy. I might as well have poured my own beer while I was at it.
I won't be back and I'm sure they don't care. There's enough people in Calgary at this point that they can offend someone and someone else will come and try it for themselves. But that can only go on for so long. They'll learn to take care of their customers long after everyone stops going...."}
{"text":"I hate you Chilis. The $9 nachos my friends and I ate at your Calgary rest. on Saturday were literally just a few bagged chips tossed onto a plate, accompanied by bland, watery salsa. Our 'appy' platter was $16 and consisted of about 12 pieces of similarly bland chicken and jalapeno poppers. At this point in the meal my fellow guests and I began to wonder if what were even eating could be understood as \"cooked food\", or whether it some cleverly disguised cardboard with the price ratcheted-up. Our drinks were margaritas with Caronitas in them. They were fine but cost $10 each. Our guess is that Chilis is run by some sort of alien CEO, operating with only a tenuous grasp of what human food is like (see cardboard) and what it should cost. I hate you Chilis. I hate you so, so much."}
{"text":"Worst chili's I have ever been to. Will never go back to this location. When we arrived there was so much garbage out front I couldn't believe it. Why didn't the manager have this cleaned up? The service was the worst I have ever experienced. To many problems to mention."}
{"text":"I love Chili's but they have gone a bit south since I used to eat there a couple times a week.

This Chili's is pretty good. Lunch is really cheap and the food is good but not great. Overall I liked it and for lunch time I'd hit it up again."}
{"text":"Awful!! I gave it 1 star coz I can't give less, disgusting food, I've been to chilis all over the world as it's an American franchise but chilis here is awful, the picture u see in the menu has nothing to do with what u get! Food is dry n tasteless veg is soggy and the service is the worst.. Never going again for sure!"}
{"text":"The food can be hit and miss sometimes, if you go on an off time you can find yourself in a long wait, but that's the nature of going out for dinner sometimes, ultimately though they deserve a 4.5 in my books simply because.. Waitress said I looked like Mark Wallberg 10/10 would blow my ego up there everyday ! Seriously though, I may open up a restaurant and base all of my interactions by complimenting people on how they look like celebrity xyz, as long as they're good looking."}
{"text":"Had a decent meal. The 1 appetizer and 2 entrees for $30 is a great deal. Cheap date night."}
{"text":"Poor beer selection, high prices. They have a few new items on the menu, and I was hoping they would be great. I got the beef enchiladas, they were way over cooked. The tortillas were rubbery, and the beef was super well done. I usually love chili's, I don't think I'll be going back to this one."}
{"text":"Checked online to see what the hours were, the site said open until midnight, we got there at 5 to 11 and we were turned away by the person working. She said they were closing at 11. You do not turn a customer away even if you are getting ready to close. I know as I have worked in this industry before and stayed open hours after closing time because of customers. I have had good experiences here in the past that is why you got the higher rating but because of tonight I am unsure if I will return."}
{"text":"Service 5/5, food 5/5, the space is deceivingly large. I can't wait for the blue jays season to start. A great place to take the family and watch the game. Fresh Shredded parmesan cheese in the Caesar  salad is just one example of how this chilis goes the extra distance for there customers."}
{"text":"Chili's used to be our 'go to' family restaurant. The food was consistent and so was the service.
We went again last week after a long absence. Walking to our table my teen daughter commented on how sticky the floor was. Yes, we were sticking to the floor. Gross! You know that awful snapping sound your shoes make as you pull them off a floor that has had pop spilled on it? Well the entire floor from the front entrance to our table at the back of the restaurant was like that.

We were seated and were given menus...and even the menus were sticky. They seriously needed replacing or at the very least disinfecting. I have children.  I'm not a germophobe. I do like things, especially places where I eat, to be reasonably clean - and this restaurant was not. Makes me wonder how clean the kitchen is and how thorough the dish washing is, too. I doubt I will ever return to Chili's. I like to be fed, not grossed out!"}
{"text":"We have been to this chilis 3 times. First time was good. Service was fast and food was good. Second time was horrible. We ended up leaving before or dinner came out and they probably didn't notice because it was an 1 hr wait. We decided to try it out again tonight. What a horrible mistake. Service was slow and food was not what you would expect. I ordered a steak sandwich and it was so small I could finish it in two bites and it only cost $17. Then my friends wife ordered a room temperature water that took almost 30 mins to arrive. She went to drink it and it was boiling hot. She didn't notice how hot it was because it was in a pop mug. It ended up burning her tongue and the inside of her mouth to a blister point. They gave us a small discount on our meal but that was it. I'm really disappointed because we really love chilis and was excited to hear it was in our area. Don't go unless you want to have a bad experience."}
{"text":"Had a good time at the bar a couple days ago. Super slow at first with only 1 bartender running the show with a full bar. I'm guessing it was a mix of people watching the Calgary Flames pre-season game and People having pre drinks prior to the show at the Jubilee. 

Once we were served, we were smart to order what we needed all at once and pay right away before the bartender disappears in the tickets of drinks and thirty customers. One can only do so much.

Drinks were good and satisfying... Worth the wait... But when your thirsty, anything taste good right. 

The time prior to last, the service was extremely slow and non existent and waited forever for the bill. You would think they would staff properly if they know there is a show at the Jubilee or something. 

Anyways, everyone has their slow days but overall, it was a good experience even if it was at Chilis. I'd try them again if going to another show at the Jubilee."}
{"text":"Are you kidding me?!  Not only did we wait for 15 minutes to be recognized at our table, no specials were mentioned or the soup of the day,  Finally the server comes to our table and takes our drink order.  Then 10 minutes later our food order.  Wanted to order a second beer right away as we were on a time schedule, but alas, no.  I had to wait a good 15 minutes after that.  We get our bill.  A DRAUGHT OF COORS LITE IS $6.76 FOR A 16 OZ GLASS!  $14 FOR TWO BEERS!!!  ARE YOU FRICKIN' KIDDING ME..AT CHILI'S?!  Never mind the mediocre chicken with the rubbery bacon for $14.00 and cold fries.  Never again!"}
{"text":"We hadn't planned to come here but after several failed attempts at other spots that were abnormally busy, the man decided this was where we were going to eat -  for our impromtu date night.

The service was great...very efficient, bordering on cheerleader bubbly. Anything we asked for we got quickly and with a smile. They were also very clear in explaining who our server was and what other people were her back up if we needed anything. So for this they get three stars. Everything else....more like a two.

We ordered wings to start. They have a choice of regular or boneless. We went with regular. They arrived on a glorified side plate with some celery and blue cheese dressing. The wings were absolutely swimming in barbecue sauce.  It looked like the wings had been thrown on the plate \"naked\" then douses with a bottle of soupy sauce. My date thought  the BBQ sauce tasted like ketchup -  he was kind of right.

He had a steak dinner. They made him cut into his steak as soon as they put it down to ensure it was cooked properly. It was but he said to me later that it lacked flavour and wasn't overly warm. He was also surprised you couldn't get a baked potato, just loaded mashed potatoes. It came with a very yellow looking piece of garlic toast and a few little carrots.  I had the jalapeno burger. It was okay but nothing to write home about. The fries were VERY salty. I had opted for a side of peppercorn gravy. It was good and I needed it to offset the salt of the fries.

Margaritas were decent and they offered a range of rums for the man to chose from with his rum and coke. Despite the great service, the food, the decor just was too \"chain\" for our liking -  it really was like a Tex Mex version of a Denny's.

The one fun part was the music they had on...think one hit wonders from the early 90's. Baby got Back, Ice Ice baby, Pump up the Jam, Technotronic. It was like being on a date in high school. Or something."}
{"text":"Have not been to this location in awhile due to poor service. well tonight beat the last time, poor service, long wait times between food, cold food and overcharged to the hilt.

two veggie fajitas, spinach dip entree, single pop = $60.00

Ran out of wraps after 3 wraps each, waited almost 15 minutes for waiter to come back to order more wraps, then he brought out stone cold wraps, waited 10 minutes between appy and entree with no drink refills.

When we questioned the bill, as two veggie fajitas (no meat) should not be the same as Chicken Fajitas they took $3.00 off each entree. Really... the \"manager\" could not authorize appropriate pricing.

This restaurant is like most others.... dram you next to everyone else so you might as well talk with strangers.

Never go back, stay away."}
{"text":"Big disappointment. . Had chicken wings at airport several years ago. .. Was excited to see one again (I live on Vancouver Island ). 8 small wings for 
$12 is just BS.. Ordered guacamole that says prepared at table sucks big time and was not prepared as advertised. .. Watery not fresh at all.. NEVER COMING BACK..."}
{"text":"DO NOT EAT HERE! GOT SICK FROM THIS PLACE! My boyfriend and I came in on a Monday night. There were about 15 people eating there. No one was at the front and it took them 5 minute to notice us and another 10 for someone to come over and take our order. Our server introduced herself as NOT our server. Bizarre. It didn't seem that busy. I wanted to ask where our actual server was. Didn't matter, none of my business
We just put in an order for egg rolls as an appy and 2 steals.  1 med and 1 med rare. 

The egg rolls came on top of shredded lettuce that were  old and brown. But since the lettuce wasn't why we ordered it, we just ate the rolls. Our steaks came 37 minutes later (I timed it with my phone) and not only were they Medium well, they were also BURNT. 

It doesn't make any sense to me that it took them that long to grill steaks on a none-busy night and have them come out less than acceptable. If it weren't for my side order of gravy, I wouldn't have even been able to eat it. Pretty much had to pay $80 for nonexistent service, mediocre appy and potentially cancerous meat. 

We usually don't complain about service or food but on the same night, I started to have an upset stomach which kept me up all night and my boyfriend had the same thing happen the next morning and throughout the day. Needless to say, we are not coming back at this location. I am not only disappointed, I am annoyed about how much money it cost me just to get sick. We should have just stayed home and cooked the meal ourselves. Same out come, just less expensive ;)"}
{"text":"When I lived in Calgary this place was one of our standards. They have a restaurant downstairs and lounge upstairs. They make good middle of the road Tex Mex style food. I came here last night to hang out with an old friend.  Amber had a steak sandwich. It was ok but she said it would have been better at a steakhouse. Shea had a quesadilla and no complaints. Looked good. I had a fajitas. You get a choice of 2 meats. It was all that was all good. Only complaint was that the salsa should have been better. To drink we all had ceasars and the were great. I then tried a crafted ceasar with bacon and it was not as good.  Thought bacon improved everything but not a ceaser."}
{"text":"I had the original ribs last Friday night for dinner.  they were okay, I've had better.  i kept hearing chili's ribs on global.  i should have ordered the enchiladas, next time!
little meat and too much bone, I'm not trying to sound erotic either, but that is my review of chili's ribs."}
{"text":"Have been to many Chilis restaurants, and this by far, exhibited the worst service I have ever experienced.
First off...we were the only table in the restaurant, aside from the employees hanging out around the bar...and our server still couldn't seem to keep up. I had to get up to go to where his \"party\" was at the bar to get a refill, and then when he finally brought our appy, he didn't bring cutlery, plates, or napkins. So then we had to wait again, and hunt him down again.
So all in all, food was decent, service horrendous. Will not be coming back to this location, which is sad because I live in this area and eat out often."}
{"text":"We went here when I decided to go to Calgary as i had a craving to find a Quiznos lol, the food here was good, I had a Chili (of course) and the waiter was really good at making sure my glass was full of Pepsi :) One thing I like about Canadian restaurants (Im assuming its a law here they have to do this?- wish they did it in the USA!) is when you pay with your credit or Debit card, the waiter comes to your table with the charge machine thingy, I like that!"}
{"text":"After a brief stop in Kensington, D and I stopped at Chili's for lunch because I'd never been before.  It was an interesting experience.

We waited at the front reception for someone to notice us and a staff member who was off duty took us to our seats, which was very nice of her though we did wonder where the on shift staff were.

We perused the menu and I pointed out that under Bottomless Beverages there were some neat things like Wildberry Iced Tea and Strawberry Lemonade.  We both ordered the Lemonade which turned out to be quite good.  It was lightly strawberry, not too acidic or sour from the lemons, a good balance overall.

For the meal itself, D ordered the Southern Smokehouse Burger with fries and gravy and I ordered the Bottomless Soup & Salad - my starting choices being the fully loaded baked potato soup and the fresco salad, with a side of garlic toast.

When the burger arrived, it looked really good.  The fries were delicious (I stole a couple at the end) and the gravy looked really thick.  The downside was the gravy wasn't actually gravy - it's peppercorn sauce.  Unfortunately the server never said anything about that and if D had known he'd have ordered something else.  I love peppercorn sauce but he doesn't care for it usually.  The other thing was they need to learn to balance the brine of their inhouse pickling mixture.  The pickles were pure garlic and D found them to be quite disgusting (we're huge pickle fans so that was quite disappointing).

My soup and salad arrived with a side of chips and salsa but no garlic bread.  The server apologized and said it would be coming shortly.  The salad was delicious enough I inhaled it - light spring greens, with a cheese that is a little like mozzarella and a nice light lime dressing.  The soup was fantastic.  It was thick, lots of potato and bacon chunks, fresh green onion, and lots of cheese.

When the waitress came back she asked how things were and I asked for a refill on the salad (since it was bottomless).  Ten minutes later the salad arrived, by which time the soup was gone, and she took the empty salad bowl but did not do the important thing any good customer service person should think to do, which was ask some variation of the question \"Would you like more of the potato soup?\"  I would have said yes.  Unfortunately, she was around so infrequently I couldn't catch her attention to ask her to refill it (there's a reason I ordered bottomless).  Also, by this point we were half an hour into our meal and the garlic toast still hadn't shown up.

She walked away for another twenty minutes.  We finished our meal, she came by asking if we wanted the bill.  Ten minutes later she came back, dropped the bill, and walked away again.  After waiting another ten minutes we went up tot he front where the hostess helped us.

She asked how our meal was and we mentioned the food was good but refills were lacking and the garlic toast never showed up.  She said that it was \"good that the toast was never put on the bill\" and all I said was that I would have sent it back if she had put it on there.  The next thing she said, which we had to restrain from laughing at, was that it was super busy, unusually so, and that the server wasn't one to ask for help.  To tell us that when she's the only one on duty that we should just put up with it was...shocking to say the least.  A few alarm bells started to ring in my head at that:

1. That's not busy, it was practically dead in there, and if that is what they call busy they should have more people serving whether the server thinks they need help or not.

2. If a server looks like they need help someone should step in and assist, not expect the customers to 'deal with it.'

3. If a server needs help they should have no problem asking for it or they should be doing a different job.  There is NOTHING wrong with asking for help and if you're bogged down it's a good thing, because otherwise people like me who have higher expectations and who will actually appreciate it if someone gets assistance won't come back.  Ever.  I may try chili's again but not that one.

Honestly, the food was great with a few tweaks, I would have liked to have tried my garlic bread and another bowl of soup since I did order the bottomless version of soup & salad (if I only wanted one I would have ordered that version).  Unfortunately the service was so non-existent that I have no interest in going back to that location, and may or may not give the franchise itself another try based on the food possibilities at another location.

I may not decide that one for a while...."}
{"text":"The restaurant was full so we sat at the bar. Comfortable stools, lots of table space and 3 great big screens to watch (it's currently NBA playoff time).  The bartenders were friendly and made sure we menus and drinks.!  The food arrived in a timely manner and did not disappoint. So, good food, great drinks and fantastic staff - 2 thumbs up!"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant- we dont have one where I live, so we eat there most times we head to Calgary, service s good, the food and price can not be beat, love it!"}
{"text":"Wow. I have no idea how this place stays in business after our experience tonight and all the reviews on Yelp here that I have just read.
Having not read the reviews prior to going (which is highly unusual), it was my brilliant idea to ask some friends to join us at this Chili's location. I had been to one once in Michigan many moons ago and it was pretty good so I wanted to hit this place up to see what it had to offer. OK, even I can make foodie mistakes. :(
We walked in and our friends had already grabbed a table. It took 15 minutes at least for me to order a drink, a lime margarita. My friend across the table from me had asked me if I had read the reviews about this restaurant. I shook my head. She advised that out of approximately 18 reviews on another review site, 17 were bad. Oh no, I thought to myself but opted to hope for the best. At least the company we keep is good!
I asked the waitress what was good to eat here. She told me to stay away from the tacos, that she gets a lot of complaints on those. She pointed out maybe 6 things that she felt were satisfactory and I opted to go for one of them - the $25 ribeye steak that came with mashed potatoes, veg and a piece of garlic toast. I ordered the steak RARE, same as always. The food took awhile but it was just an observation, we were in no real rush. My marg was pretty good so I kept busy enjoying that. It was cold and frosty and the mug size was pretty good for $7.
My meal finally came out and I could just tell that the meat was going to be overcooked. I guess the look on my face said it all and I was asked to cut into my steak to check for doneness. Yep, it was cooked well-done! Grrrr! ????? How could this happen! The server scooped it up right away knowing I had asked for a rare steak so now I got to watch all my friends eat their food! Lovely! Other things ordered by friends were fajitas, ribs and a steak sandwich. No serious gripes about those.
When my meal came out I thought it had to be a joke from the kitchen staff. Now my meat was so raw, it looked like it had just come out of the package except for a couple of light grill marks on the surface! I just did not want to deal with it so I kept it, took it home later so I could cook it myself. My friend kept remarking how gross it looked. The server at this point whether she really cared or not, I have no idea but she advised that she was removing the steak from the bill. Ahhhh - ya, do ya think?! The manager had come over twice and apologized but really, what could be done to make things any better? OK, maybe a bottle of wine but that did not happen.
I will never, ever come here again nor recommend to anyone. A Tex-Mex restaurant that cannot even cook a steak? C'mon.
I would have given it 1 star but the margarita I had saved it and made it a humble 2 star experience."}
{"text":"Based on the other reviews here, I appear to be the dissenting opinion.

I arrived here around 630 on a Monday night.  Chili's was moderately busy.  Being the single business traveler outside of the downtown core, I was seated in a booth for two.  My romantic evening with my laptop case was about to begin!

My waitress was really personable, and admitted to me that she was still in training.  After looking at the menu, I asked her for a recommendation between the three items that I had narrowed my selection down to.  She suggested the Crispy Chicken Tacos, with sides of beans, and chipotle rice.

In about 10 minutes my order arrived.  It was delivered by a beautiful woman in a bright blue shirt.  The tacos were huge due to the size of the chicken.  I enjoyed them, especially after dipping the taco into the sauce that the beans were in.  

I would have considered the food slightly over average, it was good, but not amazing.  I will credit my trainee-waitress on dropping in and making me feel welcome in the restaurant.  The manager even dropped in once to ask how my meal was.

I was pretty full by the end of the meal.  I really wanted to order the fried ice cream, but was too full to eat any more."}
{"text":"So I've been to Chili's a few times in the past few weeks and it was alright. The first time was a few weeks ago and it was alright. I ordered a margarita, and those are pretty awesome let alone huge! I always get raspberry ones now because I apparently was oblivious to the fact there are raspberry flavored drinks. Plus I think they taste delicious, better than strawberry. I ordered their mushroom swiss burger which wasn't that great to be honest. There were few mushrooms which I was disappointed about and the patty itself was quite dry. My boyfriend had the fajitas which looked pretty delicious. The next time I was there was this past Saturday. I ordered the grilled chicken sandwich. The chicken was moist and it tasted pretty delicious. Their fries are good but too salty for my liking so I didn't touch them much. I got a side of gravy which was pretty spicy. It was peppercorn gravy which I think they should state on their menu. I was with my grandma and she loves pepper and even she thought it was a bit too much.

Overall i think that Chili's is a good place but they're over-priced and their food could be a lot better for what you're paying."}
{"text":"Had a decent dining experience.
Menu was broad with a lot of varity which helped for our diverse group including vegans to carnivores.

Appetizers, drinks, pasta, steak, salads all were good for the price. It isn't a speciality place for the cuisine, but for the price and locale its a good option in the budget range.

Weekday dine-in experience wasn't great, the service should be improved."}
{"text":"When I walked in I was slammed in the face with the decibels blaring from the home theater system in the bar that was tuned into a football game. I wouldn't normally put up with that type of abuse, but it was -12 C / 10 F and snowing and I didn't have a car as I was staying at the hotel next door.

The other speakers were playing Christmas music and the combination of noise was disorientating. 

Otherwise, the service was good, the people were nice and my meal tasted fine."}
{"text":"Food was all microwave cooked nothing their is fresh, drinks were horrible they need a real bartender at that location. Just has bad as macdonalds"}
{"text":"Wow, lots of bad reviews. Weird. We've come here maybe 20 times over the last 5 years. We find it reasonable. If you're expecting a super high-end dining experience, then you should move on. Chili's is a decent family type restaurant (there is a lounge too). They have fine burgers and the like. 

My only real complaint is the \"Classic Nachos\". You get like 12 tortilla chips, each heavily loaded with good stuff. It costs like $10. It's expensive for what it is, and defies my notion of \"classic\" completely. 

Anyway, for the price, this is a fine middle-of-the-road chain restaurant."}
{"text":"Went to Chili's Southcentre last night with my family.  We were the last table ordering for the night.  The three of us ordered steak sandwiches, 1 medium, 2 medium rare.  When they came out, there were 3 different shapes and sizes, 2 well done and on med. rare.  We sent two back... Instead of refiring them, the tool the one I cut into and sent it back out to my wife... After I'd cut into it.
Then they asked us if we wanted new steaks... Yes we did.  So, the second set came out again, 17 minutes later, both again well done... At which point we were told \"That's how we do Medium rare\". Keep in mind, one was to be Medium!

Worst meal I've ever had here!

To top it off, we were close to the kitchen, and the Language coming out of there was far from child-friendly.  All for a $77.00 meal...

Went to email the restaurant, can't seem to do it, Canadian website is even out of date!  When required to enter dining date, it won't allow a 2016 date!

A real let down!  Shame, we used to enjoy going here.  Will be some time before we try them again... If ever."}
{"text":"Great place for burgers! Awesome spinach dip too. Totally recommended, even better than in US"}
{"text":"This review is based on one visit from last year for a group event. We had 20 to 30 people and all were served reasonably fast and almost at the same time. This is not an easy thing to do and I applaud Chili's for that. I don't remember any surprises either, but I am not some kind of picky gourmet who complains about the crust being 36% excessive. As a chain, Chili's felt very average but reliable. What I liked about the chain is that the menu seemed a bit lighter than that of competitors. This is not the kind of place where everyone would need a take home box."}
{"text":"worse Caesar salad I've ever had. Server was indifferent. Waited over 30 minutes for food. Cajon club was mostly bread barely any chicken. Overall the worse meal experience I've had in quite a while."}
{"text":"We decided to go here for my Grandma's 61st Birthday. We called in the morning, when they opened, and made a reservation for 12 people. Therefore, they knew in advance that we were coming and were able to secure a table. 
When we arrived we were seated right away and our table was clean but all the tables around ours were dirty. Our waitress took our drink order in a timely fashion and drinks came in a timely fashion but after that things went downhill. 
She took our food order and it was an hour before the food started to come. Even when that happened the waitress could not remember who ordered what and we were left to figure that out ourselves. The food was coming at different times so some of our party was waiting for us while there food was getting cold and then j just decided to eat. By the time they were done is the time that some of us were just getting our food. 
The waitress even completely forgot about my order and. had them back it and then brought me the plate which had just come out of the oven and didn't warn me and I Burnt myself by touching the side of the plate. 
The waitress was the only one in the restaurant and was running around, getting angry at people (you could hear her yelling at the kitchen staff). My family tried to make sense of it and asked: \"Did someone call in sick?\" to which she replied: \"No I am usually the only server but we are never this busy.\" 
Then came time for bills and she still hadn't cleared any of our dishes. We had only got one drink this whole meal and some of us were thirsty and when bills came they were all mixed up and wrong."}
{"text":"First time here and I thought it was really good. I enjoyed the food . My hubs and son ordered the steak dinner for $35 for 2 6oz steaks, loaded mash broc  and an appy. I ordered the chicken and waffle appetizer and it came with 2 . It was actually quite substantial. It was exactly what I was craving. Loved it . Wish there was one closer to my home in Vancouver. Our server Hailey was also very helpful. Good service good food and good value."}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE !!!!

I always come here when I am in Calgary :)  Food is fresh, nicely cooked and the server Colby was awesome !!   I was very impressed with my dining experience here.  That is exactly WHY I keep coming back !!!"}
{"text":"UPDATE - Decor - great. Service - great. Food - very average, portions small (unless its fries or the like) and prices have gone up to the point that there is little point in returning. Of note, the nachos were without any hesitation or doubt the grandest lacklustre display of $1.50 worth of chips with approximately 0.99 cents worth of real cheese lathered upon the exactly 12 micro thin chips all for the asking price of $14. No exaggeration required. If you have to thrust yourself into this establishment, come for the $3.99 Thursday beer night but please don't order any food. Resist at all costs. There is better for the same or less in every corner of the city. Stay Away. Please."}
{"text":"Service was good. food hot and tasty. Could have been better but could have been a lot worse"}
{"text":"One many sit down restaurants on 130th SE Calgary and definitely underrated. 

Restaurant is very clean and staff is extremely friendly. 

Price is on par with the competitors and these is a kids menu too. 

Lots of booth seating and bar section and many TVs throughout entire restaurant. 

Been here many times now and have had consistent hot food and great service. 

New menu now and can't go wrong coming here for lunch or dinner. Overall this Chili's is fantastic."}
{"text":"Not a good experience.  The food was generally ok and tasted all right.  The restaurant was loud and it was hard to hear what my kids were saying to me... And that is something!  The kids had the chicken strips, which were coated like fish batter.  They thought that was weird and pulled it all off.  I tried some and agreed that it was not so great.  Why mess with chicken fingers?  My chili was good, but 8 bucks for a small bowl?  They even charged me an extra buck for a small piece of burnt garlic toast.  Give me a break.  The meal also took a while to prepare.  To top it all off, some jerk kid in a nearby booth spit a mint at my daughter.  Not the restaurant's fault, but it was the perfect end to a bad experience."}
{"text":"First time at this chain. Looking at the menu thought it might be promising or even hold up to maybe the Cactus Club...NOT. The service here was TERRIBLE. We had a trainee and server, the two of them seemed to have no idea how to do their jobs, big fail. I order fajitas and the tortillas came warm 20 minutes before anything else and were totally cold by the time the actual tops came. We had to wait 15 mins in between drinks for another and they kept forgetting everything. Certainly didn't feel like a night out for dinner, complete waste of money. The food was Meh:( Honestly, go eat anywhere else. Worst place I've been to in a while."}
{"text":"We were in on Sunday and if rumours are true that this is new staff day the service /food showed. The food took a long time-especially the appetizers! Glad we ordered that at least. The jalepeño wings lacked flavour/zip, they were quite bland. The avocado dip was good. One of our orders was two types of meat, it came with shrimp which wasn't ordered. Our other two orders came with mostly undesirable avocado (spoiled). We got one refill and rarely saw our server though it wasn't busy. Probably won't be back"}
{"text":"Wow, service was none existent. After saying we would be seated in \"just a minute\", we sat and watched as they sat anyone and everyone that walked in!
When we tried to ask about this, she walked away.
Not a place I would go back to."}
{"text":"We were able to make a reservation for a Saturday night by phone, even though the web site said there was no availability.

We were seated promptly and were quickly served drinks while waiting for the other guests in our party. 

The appetizer platter seemed a bit lacklustre, but the guacamole made fresh to your specs at table side was amazing. Would recommend Chilis serve this with more substantial taco chips as these  were too flimsy for the chunky guacamole and kept breaking up.

Four different entrees - all were good. My husband really liked the seasoning on his steak sandwich.  Good, filling fare at a reasonable cost. Attentive and friendly servers. Will definitely be back.

Recommended - Bellinis, guacamole and steak sandwich.
Skip - south west egg rolls, buffalo chicken"}
{"text":"Solid 3.5, while it looks tall and big from the outside, just average size.

Friendly hostess asked if we wanted the restaurant or the bar, so of course the sports tv's drew our attention.  Liked how the booth seating's available.

Ordered the pulled pork wraps off their specials of the month, good tasting with the various sauces, comes in 4's.  A bit too overdone with the sauces but worth eating again.

But not the cookie in a skillet with a scoop of vanilla ice cream, pretty average.

My 1st time @ a Chili's since none in Vancouver.

At the mall, but separate entrance."}
{"text":"Do you remember that Dane Cook skit where the woman is getting really excited about pickles? \"And the pickles.... *gasp* and the piccckklleeessssss...\"? That's how I feel about Chili's deep fried pickles. They're thinly sliced so it's not like eating a tube of lava when you get wedged fried pickles. The batter is flaky and amazing and the dip is divine. If there's a heaven, it'll be filled with Chili's fried pickles. 
We usually go for burgers or ribs and are never disappointed. The fries tend to be pretty salty but definitely edible. Service can sometimes be a bit on the slow side if they're understaffed but that's to be expected."}

{"text":"On a vacation, we stopped by this Chilis because we don't have Chilis where I live.  1) the service was slow, our server said it had been a busy night, which tells me the managers (of which there was two on duty who never checked on tables) understaffed.  which leads to 2) OVERPRICED!!!  Holy crap!  To compare, we stopped at a Chilis in Spokane WA.  The salad i ordered at this Calgary Chilis was $14.99, Spokane has the exact same thing for $8.99.  Half rack of ribs at this Calgary location? $18.49, half rack at Spokane, $9.99, Full rack will only run you $17.99.  Now i know Canada establishments are higher than their US counterparts, but I have never seen this high.  Red Robin us only $1-2 more for their food over US Pricing.  I would avoid the place just because they are this expensive, there are plenty of other places in town that don't rip you off, AND have adequate staff on hand who WANT to give you good service."}
{"text":"We walked in a 11:45am.  Stood there for 5 minutes or more. No hostess around. Saw one waitress serving a few tables but no one looked our way. We walked over to milestones and were seated promptly by a smiling hostess."}
{"text":"Went in late afternoon for a birthday dinner. Had a wonderfully delicious margarita. Drink prices were very reasonable for the size, I might make this my go to place for drinks!  Ordered chips and salsa, which are now bottomless. They were thin and crisp and the salsa was very good. 
Dinner was their famous fajitas. My only complaint is the steak was sliced with the grain so it made for a chewy bite and I couldn't bite through it so I'd end up with the whole slice hanging from my mouth.  Flavour was nice and I would definitely order them again. 
Service was exceptional! She was on top of refills and anything else that was needed. 
It's been awhile since I've been here and they used to not be the best but it seems things have changed. I hope it wasn't just the day we were there. I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"I want to start off my review by saying I go to this place ALL the time. and if I was doing this review last week. I would probably give them 4 or 5 stars. 

Today I was there and we got our usual server. She knows what we want because we usually order the same thing. 

Today the service was HORRIBLE.  it took forever to get our food. 

As it turns out our food was sitting under a heat lamp for some time. 

When I got my quesadilla (gluten free), The same thing I order every week when I come here. 
It was burnt to a crisp., It was dry and gross. They offered me to replace it but we waited for almost 30 minutes to get our food and I needed to be back at work. 

the insult to injury at the end of the day is that they charged me for my order. Full price. 

I am extremely disappointed as we've had way better service from these guys in the past.


UPDATE!!!!

We thought we would give this place another try. Sadly the same thing happened to us in almost the exact same way. I will not be returning"}
{"text":"We have yet to have a bad meal at chillis having dined for lunches and dinners. That being said the last time that we dined we were bombarded with the most horrible children in a restraunt i have ever experianced. It was to the point that people with other children were uncomfortable. Managment did drop the ball for us here... our service was not up to standard 6 dads at one table 6 mums at another and 8ish 10yrold boys running wild at extremly loud levels (all one party) seemed to get all of the attention service and consideration"}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night. 26 degrees out and the patio was closed. If it weren't for the great snow-jitos we would have gone elsewhere."}
{"text":"Let me tell you a little story about Chili's.

The ladies in my family were off to a lovely evening of dinner and a play at the Jubilee.  We thought since Chili's was so close, we'd stop there for dinner before heading to the play.   Turns out, some other people going to the play thought the same thing.

We were seated fairly quickly considering how many people were in the place and were immediately asked for our drink and appetizer orders.  We received ours drink right away but waited and waited and waited for our appetizers.  After waiting for close to an hour for appetizers, and needing to get to our play soon, we unfortunately had to tell them we couldn't stay.

We were pretty peeved about the fact that we didn't get to eat before sitting through a lengthy play.  Lucky for us, the restaurant understood and gave us our drinks for free.  It was better than nothing, I suppose.

This experience (which wasn't my first but was definitely the most memorable) was enough to make me not want to go back to Chili's again.  Sorry, guys, you're just not good enough to put up with that."}
{"text":"Full of flavour. Ribs and loaded mash potatoes were the best I've had in a restaurant.  I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place is pretty decent. The fajitas are really good, but the cheese is a little overwhelming if you decide to put it on. All the other condiments you can choose to put on are great though. Portions are gigantic but everything's bigger in Texas. I got the crispy chicken crispers and it's basically 5 huge pieces of strip (and I mean ridiculously huge) - but the gold yukon fries are awesome. I couldn't even finish and had to take it in a box home with me and managed to finish maybe 3 pieces of chicken. 

It should be noted we went on a weekday afternoon around 3pm when it wasn't busy but the service was quick and pretty much efficient.

We did not get \"welcomed to Chili's\" though. If you get it. [saxophone in the distance]

+ Good service
+ Solid wait time
+ The door handles ARE LITTLE PEPPERS
+ Chili cut-outs in the chairs
+ The condiment stand that came with the fajitas had a handle shaped like a chili pepper

- Huge portions and on the pricier side but those are related to each other. If you get the crispy chicken crispers or the fajitas, just make sure you're splitting it between two people, unless you're ridiculously hungry/plan on taking leftovers home. 
- When we finished, my friends stood up and that's when you really, you know, feel it. But we were eating at Chili's so obviously we knew what was coming.

I'd recommend this place if you're prepared to eat a lot and you're not like, bringing your boyfriend or girlfriend here on the first date.

Also, you should make it so that the toilet flushers in the bathroom become shaped like chili peppers."}
{"text":"We've been here a few times (never my choice) and I have been disappointed every time. The service is so slow even when the restaurant isn't busy. Then when you finally get your food don't expect the server to come back and check in with you until you're ready to pay...which by the way, you need to wait forever to do. The portions aren't great. I have been to the Chili's in the NE and the service is much better there. Wouldn't recommend!"}
{"text":"We stopped in for lunch after shopping. It took around 30 minutes for soups and salads and a rare steak fajita. The staff is not even on top of the coffee or drink situation. My steak was over cooked and my friend's salad was dry. No dressing. I am in the industry and there is no reason for anything that we ordered to to take this long. It wasn't even busy. The baked potato was very bland and there was no salt or pepper on the table. My fajitas were cold so i asked for new ones and the camw out cold again.  Although my steak was seasoned well it was over cooked and cold to the point of I could pick up the skillet when it came. We will never be back. The manager did however take care of our bill. That was very good customer relations."}
{"text":"HAHA.. it's funny when you logon and plan to write a poor review and then discover that the place you are reviewing IS ALWAYS BADLY REVIEWED. So, I don't feel bad anymore...I guess I never really felt bad anyways.

It was a quick stop in before a show at the Jubilee at 7:00pm on a Wednesday. Much to my surprise, it was pretty busy for a random location in a poor mall. We were seated quickly and given menus fast which was effective given we had very little time. We ordered beers and desserts only as it was a birthday for one of the party, so we celebrated with some gratuitous sugar fixes. We ordered two of their \"lave cake\" and one paradise bar. The beers came fast and were deliciously cold, and the desserts shortly followed. This is where the uber letdown occurred. The lava cakes were overcooked (assumedly) and were \"lava free\". It was like modern day Kaua'I - a big Hawaiian island shaped like a volcano, but no lava. The plates contained large, dried chocolate flavored sponge cakes with an oversized scoop of cheap vanilla ice cream (I'd prefer a smaller scoop of decent vanilla bean any time of the day). Essentially these were a huge waste of empty calories, and a disappointment as the menu on has two desserts and you would expect both to be superstars. (I am also a hard critic as I reviewed a Joey Tomatoes lava cake last week that blew my ganauchey mind). The other dessert was better, but still MEH. Again, too much ice cream, so any flavor or taste was lost or soggy. Trying to make a quick escape proved difficult as the server never came back after we got the desserts and we had issues flagging her down for a bill.

Based on my experience, it's definitely not a place for beers and desserts. Maybe supper proves better but I'm willing to doubt it."}
{"text":"Went to Chili's for a light lunch on their patio after shopping at South Center.  

The staff was friendly, however our waitress didn't show up so someone else took our drink and food order.  
I ordered a caesar which was delicious and made with horse radish - just how I like.
My SO ordered a beer, but the staff member taking our drink order had no idea what beers they had on tap were local.   Big pet peeve is having an employee NOT know anything about the beers they serve!

Anyways, our food came promptly.  He ordered the chili cheese fries which were very tasty and had bits of bacon in the chili, very cool.
I ordered the steak tacos - the flavour and the onions were great, however the steak chunks tasted a little odd, sort of like moist beef jerky, not steak.  I really enjoyed my salad and overall the service was OK.

Nothing fantastic, but not terrible either."}
{"text":"I've tried to eat here a few times and haven't been impressed.  The food is way over priced.  I had the same nachos as the previous reviewer,  they worked out to be $1.50 per nacho.  Way not worth it.  Also the place isn't very clean and the wait staff aren't very courteous or overly professional, it can take a while to get service sometimes."}
