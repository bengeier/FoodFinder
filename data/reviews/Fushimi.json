{"text":"Have been here a couple of times, for take out as well as eat in. It's located right on Church Street and is unassuming. You could easily pass it because the entrance is more narrow than some of the other storefronts on the street.

Good value/prices, good seating in the back and they're really accommodating for take out. They also have an all-you-can-eat menu.

This time, we came for take out. Ordered quickly with the front hostess. They even us asked us if we wanted water while we waited for our order. The atmosphere was chill, music wasn't too loud and the seating was decently packed around 7:30 pm.

For around $36, we got: Tuna Pizza, Volcano roll (8 pcs), Chicken Fried Upon and the Spicy Platter (18 pcs), which comes with soup and salad.

Very yummy and a ton for the price!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. Quality was premium.. Better than I was expecting. Price is a very good deal for the quality."}
{"text":"Great portion (unlike some all you can eat place you order 20 pieces of sashimi they bring out 5), innovative menu!! Theres no particularly bad dish, everything we had (and thats almost the entire menu) was decent. Although weekend price is higher than a normal all you can eat place, its completely worth it, and i speak for the 9 of us. Strongly recommended! (Maybethe service is not the best lol)"}
{"text":"Love the sushi buffet here. They made food looks pretty but also tasty. All worth my money spent. For sure I'll go back and bring my friends too. :-)"}
{"text":"OMG so much food!  I just took my dad and brother there, I never thought I would witness this...but: Fushimi (1) : Brother (0).  We ordered the salmon ceviche, pepper salmon, truffle white tuna, crab salad, tempura and a bunch of specialty rolls (I've lost count); everything was delicious and well put together.  My brother ordered two sushi pizzas despite the server trying to explain their size (obvious hint that we've ordered too much).  As said by other reviewers, the portion sizes are smaller and perfect for gaining variety.  The mango and black sesame pudding were yummy, the tiramisu was tiny and adorable.  Fushimi is a great AYCE as long as you know your limits and eat responsibly."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed Fushimi last night. Salmon wasn't a strong point across the rolls or the sashimi but everything else was tasty. Nice decor, reasonably priced and while a quick explanation of the system would have been handy for our first visit the lack of service didn't bother us.
Note that the portions are small but found this great as we were able to try lots of things with out filling up or wasting food. It's worth noting though if you would like more of a particular dish."}
{"text":"Do not bother going to this place. It's not worth the price.

I recently went on a Sunday night. The place is huge but we noticed only 3-4 tables were occupied by customers... thought it was strange how empty the restaurant was on a Sunday night, but now I know why.

The food was not good. For $24.99 they should've done a better job. We ordered a lot of food but it came SUPER SLOWLY and some of the items were not in the quantity we ordered (it was either too much or too little). They also missed a few of our orders (i.e. we had to order our rolls 2-3 times before they arrived). The dessert part is usually what I look forward to the most in AYCE, but their dessert SUCKS. Like seriously, they have the worst mango yogurt ever. 

We practically received no service at all. Even though there were only a few tables of customers, we hardly received any attention or service from the waiters/waitresses. We had to wave our hands so many times before they came to take our order. And when we paid the bill, the waitress just handed us the credit machine without saying anything like thank you or have a good night... not even a smile. 

I will never return to this restaurant again."}
{"text":"Food quality is pretty good but the servers are very rude. We didn't get everything we ordered in the end and the servers took very long to get our order.."}
{"text":"Good AYCE Japanese in the downtown area. Reasonable prices.

Fushimi offers a good selection of sushi and cooked Japanese items, nothing really different, mostly what you would expect. If you're really into rolls, they have the standard ones and offer a short list of \"special\" rolls. Overall, they may not have the same variety as some of their Asian fusion counterparts, but after our first visit today, I can comfortably say it's one of the better AYCE Japanese restaurants I've been to in the downtown area (i.e. compared to Wild Ginger, Kyoto House, Gallery Sushi, Masa, Takumi.) 

The quality of all the food we ordered (sushi, cooked items) was consistently good. The restaurant wasn't overly busy, so service was good and quick. Decor is OK, nothing to write home about, but it seemed clean. 

Weekend lunch is $13.99, which is very reasonable. And a bonus is that dessert is included (ice cream). The dishes we liked most from our lunch today: Beef Negimaki (beef wrapped around green onion and mushrooms), Agedashi Tofu, Spicy crab salad (not spicy), Chicken yakitori. I enjoyed my sushi (including spicy salmon hand roll, their \"Out of Control\" roll). The Salmon pizza was only OK, I found the rice pizza part a bit too thick; it was crispy a wee bit mushy on the inside. The Red Bean ice cream was bland, as was the Black Sesame pudding, but the Green Tea and Mano ice cream was good."}
{"text":"A hidden gem and a cozy Japanese restaurant located in Toronto's gay village.  Good value for money, great seating, and a good selection of veg and non-veg choices from the menu."}
{"text":"Fishimi... Former Taste of Japan restaurant... Same people different food... They changed the Hot Table menu, now is a poor quality food... But dont get me wrong, cooks are great! They try to entertaining you while you get serve... Quite different from the waitress...

Anyway, like i said, restaurant was a little better before they change the name..."}
{"text":"We went Fushimi for lunch last Saturday.  We have been to several other Chinese owned Japanese AYCE restaurants in GTA ( like Ten-ichi etc) and we like this one better.
The waiters were very friendly and served attentively. And unlke Ten-Ichi, Fushimi never missed the orders. Everything we ordered came to our table. The food is above the level of other Japanese AYCE restaurants. But some were too salty while others are quite fresh and tasty. 
The only thing we want to complain about the food is the sweet potato tempura. You have to order 4 pieces in each order. And each piece is huge in size (more than 8 cm of diameter and about 1 cm thickness. In other AYCE restaurants, the normal size is about 4 cm in diameter.) so if you don't want to waste food and don't have people to share with you, you will feel almost completely full after eating this sweet potato tempura. 


We enjoyed the lunch and most likely will try dinner in the future."}
{"text":"Had their AYCE lunch today and it was very satisfying. Sushi rolls, noodle soups and salads were all good. If anything disappointing it would have been the beef steak. Otherwise, it was all very good considering this is just an Asian fusion restaurant and not an authentic Japanese place. The service was reasonable given the restaurant was very full too. Will definitely come back for more."}
{"text":"Great taste and great prices. Never expect a ayce can do the dishes that pretty and food are really fresh. Fushimi really surprised me and my frd who almost tried all the Japanese restaurant in town"}
{"text":"bad service. I won't return again. people there have some weird ass attitude. I dont like fake nice people. I accidentally knocked over some stuff, and the waiter told me nice job. WHAT KIND OF SERVICE IS THIS?"}

We were craving Teppanyaki, so we picked AYCE Teppanyaki.  Way too rushed.

{"text":"This place is amazing. I've been to several all you can eat sushi joints in Toronto, but this one takes the cake by far. The menu is HUGE and everything is so delicious..And if you're lucky, your sashimi will come out on flashing colourful ice... The Volcano roll, peppered salmon, and truffle tuna are probably the best items on the menu. If you choose to go the a la carte route, the prices are really cheap. Great value, amazing service. Definitely highly recommended for all you can eat lovers."}
{"text":"First 2times the service were very good. But 3rd time and 4th time the servers were very slow eventhough i went during non busy hour. Around 9pm on weekday. The servers were very rude and didn't seem like they care about customer service at all. However the manager there is a nice guy there."}
{"text":"For AYCE, it was a little more on the expensive side, and no discount for using cash. It came out to $27 per person on a weeknight including tip and tax.

However, the food is yummy, there is very wide and unique selection, and the staff are very friendly and prompt, so it's justifiable. 

The mutton skewers were VERY salty, I didn't like them very much. The meat was cooked deliciously, but all the salt really took away from it.

I did really like their baked cheese oysters though. The fact that they even serve oysters here is a big plus, however it appears to be a limited seasonal thing or something. Call ahead to ask if you're unsure.

I also really enjoyed the fried squid skewer. It was like a miniature version of those you find at Night it Up or Taste of Asia.

They also had calamari maki or handrolls which was a surprise for me because I never usually see those on the menu at sushi AYCE restaurants. The handroll was amazing, I really enjoyed it.

The interior was okay-looking, nothing spectacular. It actually kind of felt like I was sitting in someone's house because of the carpet and how there's only one light source in the room I was in. The music taste was all over the place; they played a lot of instrumental piano music or jazz music, but then it suddenly switched to traditional Asian music, and then a lullaby. But we didn't come for the music, we came for the food, soooo......

Overall, it was an enjoyable meal! However I wouldn't come too often because of the price."}
{"text":"Went there with a friend of mine about a week ago. We went on a weekday evening and seated right away; however, people who came a little later than us had to wait a little bit to be seated. After comparing the prices of the regular menu and AYCE price we decided to go for AYCE. Both rolls and AYCE prices were cheaper than some other places I've been to - it was about $23 on weekdays.

There seemed to be only one person serving the tables so we had to wait a bit to initially to be served. However, our orders came within reasonable amount of time. The shrimp sushi had a little bit of funky taste to it. It was a bit too vinegary. The rest were okay, but I guess that's what you get for cheaper sushi. We also ended up getting a roll that neither of us ordered. Since there is a 'fine' for leaving food, I had to force myself to eat it."}
{"text":"The decor is definitley lacking but I don't expect very much when I go to an AYCE.  It was clean so that's good enough for me as  I'm just there to eat.  All the food was fairly good and decent for an AYCE place.  The service was good and we didn't wait too long for our food to come out.  I like that you can mark down on the sheet what you want and give it to them.  I hate the AYCE places where you have to order it from the server.  Some of our stuff didn't come out and the girl was very nice and checked for us and our stuff finally came out.  And she came back to check that we got everything.  They have a huge menu and lots of variety.  They have your standard AYCE items plus lots more.  Everything was tasty and fresh so no compaints.  The fried rice dishes were good, they weren't very oily and you can actually see pieces of egg in it.  Their signature rolls were all tasty and different from the standard fare you usually get so that was a nice change.  I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"I went back. I wish I hadn't. 
They do this thing where they stop making your food when they want to. And if you ask about your order, they say that they are busy and that you must wait, even though you have already waited 30 minutes. Not even one dish from our later order came.
Each round of food takes SO long to come out. We waited one hour total out of our 2 hour period in the resto. They must not have enough people working in the kitchen. It is a pity, because the food is good (although it wasn't as good since the last time I went, but still very good). Eventually, we just left because we thought it was ridiculous how slow our food was coming out.

TL; DR  Food is VERY slow to come out, you will be waiting so long to eat. They stop giving you food when THEY think you've had enough."}
{"text":"I read the reviews before coming here and was expecting decent food because of the 4 star reviews. The fish was not that fresh (one dish was came to us the sashimi was totally submerged in melted ice water -ew.) and the shrimp totally went bad and so much more. Definitely had better AYCE, I don't know why there are so many 4 star reviews."}
{"text":"Its a little on the high side price wise but definitely the best all you can eat sushi in downtown TO in my experience - certianly worth the $3 or $4 premium over Kyoto house"}
{"text":"If you want all you can eat Japanese food, this is the place to go.  You are given a menu and then you are supposed to write what you would like on an order sheet.  Everytime we bring guests to this restaurant, they are shocked by how many items are available.  Lunch on weekend is $13.99 which is a great deal compared to other restaurants.  The reason I didn't give this place 5 stars is because the service can be less than desirable.  The servers could smile once in a while.  At least the manager is really nice to us so I'll still keep coming back."}
{"text":"I always went to Maizon for all you can eat lunch and even though they have quick service their food isnt HALF as good as here. For anyone going for lunch in Markham
THIS IS THE PLACE TO GO!"}
{"text":"AYCE: Consistently fresh sashimi, great selection of desert, great maki rolls. They also have specials that are updated regularly that keeps visits fresh. Menu also includes items that aren't found in any other all you can eat sushi places: baked mussels, mutton skewers, etc. 

Staff is responsive and gives you what you order."}

cons
-pricey for the all you can eat

{"text":"I live in Markham, so Japanese AYCE (all you can eat) places are pretty common and I've tried most of them.   Fushimi used to be a \"Taste of Japan\" location before which I've tried so I know what fare they used to have as well.

I'm amazingly surprised at the not only the fast service but the quality of food as in the sushi and sashimi, and the cooked dishes on the menu as well.  Usually AYCE places the fish used in the sushi & sashimi is subpar, but I found it to be fresh and tasty here.

I agree with the previous poster, Maison across the street another AYCE has great service -- but like most AYCE places they use too much rice in their sushi & sashimi and their fish is usually subpar.  Edible and probably not a problem for the average AYCE participant, but I'd rather go eat at Fushimi.

I found that plain named dishes like for instance shrimp on a skewer were fresh and cooked to delicious perfection -- I dunno if they did them over open gas flame or charcoal but they were simple and tasty.

I love when they use prawns in they're tempura and not butterflied tiger shrimp that is hidden under batter.  You can really taste the difference and they didn't over batter the tempura at all; which as you know can become very oily if they did.

My suggestion try everything.  I love avocado and the avocado maki were to die for, like butter.   I had really given up on AYCE places, but this one is an AYCE with regular restaurant quality food.

I didn't give it 5 stars cause the decor didn't change much from when it was \"Taste of Japan\" apart from many yellow wood dividers between tables.  But really this is an AYCE restaurant, as long as the service and food stay up to par or exceed my expectations --- you can count on me coming back again and again.

And as well the food was well known fare so I would give it a 4.5 out 5, but not the most perfect meal I've ever had that blew me away which would get me a 5 out 5.  Still amazingly surprised for an all you can eat place.

Its only been open for roughly a year now, so take note when this review was done.   I say this because most AYCE places then to be really good for the first few months then the quality trails off."}
{"text":"Fushimi offers a very fair price AYCE sushi in comparison with other restaurants downtown. It cost $22.99 for a weekday, however, it costs $25.99 for weekends and holidays.

I love how the sashimi here is served on ice. It definitely reinforces the freshness. 

They also have several specialty rolls that are unique here such as: the Fushimi Roll, and the Out of Control Roll. All of which were excellent and I would definitely recommend. I also ordered Salmon Tartar which was topped with a Pringle! I absolutely loved the layers of this!

Their cooked items were also excellent. I especially loved the grilled mackerel and gyoza.

In terms of service, the waiters/waitresses were incredibly attentive. They checked up on us occasionally to check if we wanted to anything else and were friendly. However, the guy who picked up the phone when I made my reservations was a bit odd. He would quickly hang up on me without confirming the reservation. At this point, I wasn't sure he had actually understood what I had said, prompting me to call back again just for confirmation. 

Atmosphere: 3/5 | Service: 4/5 | Price: 5/5"}
{"text":"Their regular menu is tasteless and there's a huge difference between the regular menu and all you can eat. Since I had a bad experience with regular menu last time so I tried all you can eat. Terrible service everything comes so late! long wait between serving each plate made me leave the restaurant. rude waitresses speak in their language and barely understand what you saying. Ruined my weekend"}
{"text":"Average sushi.. Nothing to brag about but then again nothing nothing to complain about.. Service was good.
 Wish there were more roll options.."}
{"text":"I don't know how people rated 5 stars. Came here for lunch and it was terrible. If you are avid sushi lover, you know quality...this is not quality grade sushi. So disappointed that those reviews were misleading. Not to mention the parking meters are broken on both sides of the street."}
{"text":"I can't complain about the food. It tasted good. 
However the service was very very bad.
The restaurant wasn't even busy when we were there and the server took forever to get our little all you can eat sheet with our order. Then when we had written down the order the third and last time, we waited forever for one of them to get it- we finally say excuse me- the server takes our order and I thought the food would come.
25 minutes go by.. Finally we ask.. What happened? They were completely clueless- almost as if they took the paper and threw it out.
Finally the food came.. We put steak.. They simply ignored this completely. 
Also the sheet system for the all you eat is so old school. 
Usually if the place has the paper, they have all the options on the sheet and you just add numbers. HERE we had to get the item number for each one like write down I 176 or I 156 and then the quantity. WAY TO MUCH WORK.

So never going there again- there's a million sushi places that don't treat you like this."}
{"text":"I am in love with Fushimi. Great rolls and super great prices! I pick-up Sush probably two or more times a week from this location. 

I would love if they offered brown or black rice for a healthier option, but other than that- this is the best option for Sushi in the whole area!

Try the Yam Tempura roll! Amaze-balls."}
{"text":"Decent prices, great all you can eat selection and fast too!!!
Portions are decent, service is great, I absolutely love this place, great addition to the neighbourhood"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE! AVOID THIS AYCE Fushimi!

Went there during a weekday night. We all started to get excited to try out this AYCE because we were hungry and ready to order a lot.

First impression, there were at least 5 little flies (suppose to be those little flies born from the soya sauce) flying around our table and head. The first drop of soya sauce had a dead baby brown flies. Then as we start to eat, there are more than 5 little flies flying around our food and face. For the worst, we saw a tiny creature like baby spider or wood bugs or something that runs around very very quickly on the plate.  @.@!

We then request to move our sits, and it got better away from the corner table. 

The sushi is overall acceptable, but the kitchen food is the worst I have ever had so far from all the AYCE in Richmond Hill.

You can see the attached picture of a seafood ramen, it tasted like salty instant noodle with some mix of seafood? I can only see mix of mushroom vege though. Check out the picture, the soup base is brown in a way that is not normal. 

We did not re-order the third round and I can't believe myself eating Eda Mame to stop my hunger. Did not try the dessert menu too because afraid of getting stomach ache from the kitchen ice cream. I really have a doubt about the sanity in the kitchen.

The reason we tried this place is because the previous reviews and all the pictures look so amazing and thought of giving it a try. But I guess they went downhill a lot recently."}
{"text":"As far as AYCE sushi places go, this place is  my favorite. Ive been to many, including sushi on 7, yangs, akbane, ajisai, syogun, and maison du japon, and this one is still the best IMHO. I dont bother going to other AYCE places anymore. (Ok, maybe Akbane occaisionally)"}
{"text":"TERRIBLE service and above average food. We waited for 1.5 hours and there's still 4 dishes from our first order missing. We ordered surf clams in sashimi twice and none showed up. There's only one or two waiter working while there's more than ten tables waiting. Be warned! This is not the place to go if you want any good service at all. I was here 3 months ago and it was a good experience and this time everything is ruined. Will not return, ever!"}
{"text":"I'd never been here before, and never had sushi, so I went with a friend who knew it all. We were handed paper order forms along with the menu so we could begin ordering the all-you-can-eat. I let my friend order everything. We had at least 15 different items. Each was served quickly and efficiently, each one very delicious. The tempura shrimp was something definitely worth going back for. Overall a solid stand out in a neighbourhood full of restaurants."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is very pleasant and the staff are very polite. The service was pretty fast and the presentation of the dishes was impressive. Sashimi was served on a mound of ice and salads were served in large and showy plates. The quality of the food was also higher than I'm used to seeing at all you can eat joints. The overall experience would lead you to believe that the bill would total more than 21.99 per person for dinner. I'll be coming back!"}
{"text":"I love this place. However the last time I went here was about half a year ago. I moved so it is a little difficult to get here. 
I always get the AYCE because I love paying a set price for a variety of items. The peppered salmon, and tuna are my fav. Their sashimi are placed on a mountain of ice. The tar tar tuna is really good too. They have dinner specials for weekends which is worth it. 

Service is not the best, but when there are less people in the place the service is better. I don't mind it because doing a AYCE, it is hard to expect good service. You write what you want on paper corresponding to the item."}
{"text":"Fushimi is a hidden gem. Their sushi, sashimi,rolls are among the best as far as all you can eat is concerned. Their cooked food is great as well. Service is also good. Dinner is 20.99. 

About the food 

Special mention is that this is the only place I been to that serves eel sashimi.  Truffle white tuna is a must try. Mutton Kebab is tasty and tender. Fushimi signature roll is really good. Tempura and teppanyaki is decent. 

Place 
The place is a little dark and old hence the 4 stars but clean. 

Conclusion 
eat here, you won't regret it. It's worth it."}
{"text":"Service can be improved, takes around 3 times for them to actually give you a glass of water
Food is decent and comes fast though
I always go here because it is close to my house and alot better than alot of other ayce sushis"}
{"text":"Great AYCE place!!! I have recommended this place to a lot of my friends they all liked it!!"}
{"text":"Its hard to find a good AYCE sushi place downtown but I think this could be it.  My friend and I were there last Sunday and everything was spectacular.  The staff were nice and food was delivered timely.   Goal at buffets is to eat as little cards ie. Sushi rolls,  so we tried almost all the apps. The truffle sashimi was amazing we ordered 3 times.   The black sesame ice cream is to die for."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch. Good variety for AYCE lunch. Would've been better if the seaweed salad was availabe for lunch. Staff is attentive, not sure if this would be the case if it was busier. Overall great value for the price. I found it interesting that the yakitori was served skewered onto a large piece of orange peel. The taste of the orange overpowered the entire dish. Didn't like it too much but some might find the fragrance a nice touch. I would come again to check out the dinner menu which is twice the size of the lunch menu."}
{"text":"3.5 stars
I've only gotten sushi take out from this place, which was tasty and price was reasonable. The rice to filling ratio here is how i like my sushi - not so much rice that you barely taste the filling. Might try their AYCE some day, since I live nearby."}
{"text":"Great causal place to go to satisfy your sushi craving! I ordered from the regular all you can eat menu, which was well priced - $24 per person before tip (I was surprised that tip wasn't already calculated in like most ALYE). I was craving sashimi and it was amazing here. Very fresh and perfectly proportioned. I particularly loved salmon and the clam. The specialty roll that's made of cucumber shell, without rice was also really addicted. Be sure to order the chicken skewers, butter mushroom and short ribs for hot dishes. However, stay away from the rice dishes, it was really oily and salty. Lastly, dessert was the best part of my meal! I highly recommend the mango yogurt, red bean pudding, the panna cotta and pretty much any of the ice creams. I had to have ordered desserts 3x. Also, there was great service! Staff was friendly, food was brought out quickly and hot! I really enjoyed my experience here and would highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Best AYCE sushi downtown by far, lots of unique menu items that make it way more interesting than the typical joint."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times before and it's usually not bad. This time I came in and barely got acknowledged at all. They didn't say anything at first, then proceeded to even pick up the phone before even saying it will be a minute to get a table. 

The food was fairly good, but the service was horrible. They took quite a while between orders and even forgot some stuff. It's not like my boyfriend and I really ordered that much food at once, I've ordered more before. I asked them about the missing item and they said they sent all of the items out but they clearly didn't, it was on the iPad. Finally I got my Naruto rolls after waiting almost an hour for them. 

Not sure if I'm going to go back there anymore. Food was still half decent but the service was lacking. Maybe just had a bad experience, but I don't know if I want to risk it next time."}
{"text":"Certainly not the best sushi I've had in Toronto. Not the worst either. My main problem was with the service. Went for AYCA with my girlfriend, and in the beginning everything was great. First bit of food came out in no time. Portions weren't too big, or too small; however, as time went on and new tables arrived, we were totally ignored. When we finally were able to order our final dishes, the desserts never even came. There were only a few tables and at two servers. We were continuously bypassed and ignored. When we finally did get a servers attention to re-order, they brought out twice as much as what we ordered...and the desserts weren't even good. It then took another 15 minutes to attempt to get out bill. At that point, I just went to the front myself to grab someone, just so we could pay and get out of there. All in all, we probably spent a good hour of waiting when it wasn't even busy. Would hate to see what would happen on a busy night. Ignoring the service, we did enjoy the food. Unfortunately, there are just so many other great sushi places in Toronto for me to want to bother going back and dealing with service like that again."}
{"text":"Food is great! Service is great as well! Food might take abit to arrive, but not a big concern!"}
{"text":"A group of us decided to try this place for lunch from a recommendation.  We were given an iPad to order from, and it wasn't too difficult to navigate.  The service was not too bad.  We didn't have to wait too long for food to come.  Although getting someone to refill our waters was somewhat of a challenge. 

The lunch AYCE  is a good deal. I thought the variety of food was great. Can't complain about quality for the price."}
{"text":"I thought Ten Ichi in Scarborough was the best all u can eat but Fushimi has refreshed my rating list. Fresh sashimi, great service, great price and fast serving speed. I am in love with their walnut shrimps, we ordered three times! Their ramen was amazing, the soup base wasn't salty at all ! Also, the Japanese octupus nuggets were special, aged tofu was hot and soft. Can't leave without trying their mango yogurt or pudding. The sesame one was very light and yummy too. Tiramisu was kind of a joke because it barely covered the bottom of the cup. Overall great dining experience and would definitely recommend to friends and go back."}
{"text":"So mean to a lady with baby!! Tonight I hang out with my gf. I saw the waiter asked a lady who already seated stand up and change the seat to the very corner of the wall, dim and tight space. They insisted that she can only sit in the corner with a stroller even if there are still many vacant seats at 7 pm. The lady left then with her baby quietly, while the waiters were still talking abt her behind her back...my gf let me open the door for her. I believe we will never come here again will choose the Spring Roll next time. ;P"}
{"text":"The ebi sushi was salty and dry there. The rolls are also quite large so you won't be able to order too much. The servers and very friendly, but the options are limited. Very few rolls to choose from. At $20 including tax and tip on a weekend for lunch downtown, you can find a better place."}
{"text":"Actually, I had to say this place is too far away from my home. I even cannot understand why TTC will ask me to pay extra 4 dollars for going through the steels street.

My classmates gave me this location, sushi, sashimi and some meat taste very nice. Each of us just paid over 25 dollars for dinner and each so much food as we.

So, 2 stars might be my great comments for this place."}
{"text":"If you are looking for an AYCE sushi place with quick, friendly service, nice atmosphere and excellent sushi, well this is the place for you. We went to Fushimi on a Friday night and had no problems with the speed or accuracy of their service. They were fast and very attentive, even though we pestered them with a lot of questions. 

Food: Furthermore, we loved the unique combinations of rolls and offerings they had.  They had a number if rolls with Mango in it, and they were quite delicious. They also did not stuff their rolls with rice which a lot of places tend to do.Their traditional rolls themselves were quite good. Their appetizers were also quite fresh, and great variety. Finally the Sashimi- we love LOVE sashimi in general and were very pleased with how fresh the Sashimi was here. My only complaint is that each piece itself is smaller than your typical sashimi pieces. However, since you can order more, this really isn't that big of a deal. I just enjoy the thicker slices more. 

Overall, it was an excellent experience. I think I've found my new favorite spot!"}

{"text":"We went to Fushimi one weekend lunch for my wife's grandmother's birthday. They have a very interesting All You Can Eat option where they featured a teppanyaki menu with a chef that cooks and performs in front of you. However, because the chef cooks and performs, he only does it once, so you can only order off the teppanyaki menu once which was a little strange. The food though is really good. It is above or on par with most AYCE places. The service was prompt and the servers were nice in general. They did not miss our order which is rare with AYCE places. The rolls were good and the sushi was not bad either. No Sashimi option for lunch which I guess makes sense as they would lose too much money this way. The holiday price is $14.99 which is how much a lunch bento costs in some places. I would recommend this place for all to try."}

{"text":"Came here Monday night for dinner.

Restaurant looks small when you first walk in but there is lots of seating at the back. 

We opted for a la carte but there is an AYCE option for $23.  

Sushi was very reasonably priced. I was quite surprised.  Sashimi slices were cut fairly large and tasted ok.  Rolls had a minimal amount of rice.  

Service was quick and efficient, not overly friendly.  Will be back."}
{"text":"I used to love this place. Even when the waitress before was kind of clueless. But now the horrible service is overshadowing the quality of the food. Well the food has gotten worse too. Hope it will get back to what it used to be."}
{"text":"The food was delicious and the presentation was impressive! I highly recommend the out of control roll. With an ayce lunch menu for $15, you can't go wrong. However, the service wasn't the greatest. Our server threw one of our orders on the table and was very unpleasant. Overall, good food but don't expect the service to be up to par. 3 stars!"}
{"text":"The menu has a lot of items but the execution is poor on almost everything. All the rolls are loosely rolled and fall apart almost immediately after being picked up. The eel pizza had a strong fishiness to it. The sashimi was moderately fresh but the pieces were cut too small. The restaurant was also severely understaffed so prepare to be totally ignored if you're seated close to the entrance. Overall, a very forgettable meal even for AYCE sushi."}
{"text":"The food here was ok, however the service was appallingly bad. The other 5 people I went to dinner commented on the bad service which was mentioned several times on other reviews. 

Food:
iPad ordering with lots of options. Nothing spectacular that stands out over other ACYE places I've been to. The salmon sashimi was good but the white tuna sashimi looked like it was recently thawed and still looked a bit frozen. The rolls are too big with too much rice. 

Atmosphere:
The floors were sticky and there was a lot of food spilled on the floor. Bathrooms, although interestingly designed was out of paper towel in the dispenser, and looked like 1am at the bars. There were overflowing garbage bins and toilet paper everywhere.

Service:
Everyone seemed annoyed to serve. The servers would drop off the food without saying anything, kinda just harshly sliding the plates towards you. When we went to pay, there was a sign that said \"10% student discount, ask for details\" and we were yelled at \"10% OFF FOR CASH ONLY!\".
Ok bro, calm yourself. 

I'm not sure why this place gets really good reviews? Maybe because it's AYCE in the downtown core but just go to KaKa AYCE or Spoon & Fork. It's worth the drive and the food is 100x better. The cleanliness of this place leaves you wondering if you'll get food poisoning and then the service leaves a bitter taste in your mouth."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. For all-you-can-eat dinner, there is no better place to go. The quality of the food is unmatched with any other AYCE places, and they also put more effort into the presentation of the food. The sashimi here is so fresh and the rolls are also great. We've tried a lot of AYCE places and once we found Fushimi's AYCE dinner, we haven't gone anywhere else. The honey wasabi sauce they have on some of the rolls is really, really good, and the black sesame ice cream is also SO good. They've recently switched to using i-pads, which I am thankful for, since they've lost our tickets on 2 separate occasions, and you know how annoying that is when you've placed an order for 2,500 rolls and 12,000 pieces of sashimi and you have to redo everything. 

I'm not as big of a fan of their lunch, but I only went once a few years ago, since the options were much more limited compared to the dinner, and also compared to other AYCE places around. The quality is still better here, no doubt, but all the 'good' rolls (in my opinion) were not available."}
{"text":"To start there were many more good things than bad. We were very impressed overall and will definitely go back. Nothing was actually bad.

First, if you expect amazing service and feel let done by your visit here, then you're forgetting that you are at an AYCE restaurant. It's basically a buffet. You're not going for service, and if you complain about it then you should loosen your wallet and go to a quality a la carte sushi restaurant. Service isn't \"engaging\" per say, but they get the job done fast, and they do things right.

Ok so all the good things that usually are a headache at AYCE sushi restaurants.
1. I love the iPad not because it's modern but because every dish has a detailed description which means no guessing games when ordering.
2. Water: I usually have to beg for water and even then I have to pour it into the green tea to cool it down so that I get more liquid to drink. At fushimi they give you large glasses and a full carafe of water in the middle of the table. Awesome!!
3. Last call at 3:30. This is about an hour later than most places for lunch AYCE.
4. The place was pretty clean and modern. Washrooms were also pretty interesting and in good condition.
5. My girlfriend really liked the food. To me be it was just OK. To be honest that's all I was hoping for so it was still a win for me. That cheese wontons are definitely top of the line though, and sushi rolls over all had a pretty good rice to ingredients ratio. Sometimes the rolls are 90% rice.
6. Food quality was pretty good (for the price it was amazingly good). Food was as advertised also.

We will definitely go back for our sushi fix in the future."}
{"text":"This is my favorite AYCE, I love their food and I live in the neighborhood, so I'm here 3-4 times a week with friends. The problem with this place is the servers. They are super rude and full of attitude. I want to comeback here, but they either need to train the servers on customer service or hire somebody who knows customer service. I usually tip 20-25%, today I'm tipping $0, and I'm not happy about it but hey, tip is based on customer service."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the all you can eat menu at dinner tonight.  Excellent selection of sushi, sashimi , salads, soups and more.  Not a buffet, and, in my view, much better.  You order from a menu and the wait staff brings what you ordered.  Then, when you are ready, you order some more.  The items were presented well, and I found the service generally to be very good.  For $21 for dinner (midweek), it was a treat and a good value.  Meal comes with desserts, also ordered off the menu, including green tea ice cream and tiramisu.  

Overall, a very good meal.  A couple of people commented earlier on Yelp that the rolls were not heavy on the rice, and I would agree with that.  For example, the spicy tuna roll was a thin circle of rice around a large amount of spicy tuna.  Very good and satisfying.  The rolls wrapped by cucumber also are very good and the cool and crunchy cucumber complemented well a spicy tuna or other spicy item.

Wait staff were prompt and very friendly.

I am here on business, and it is unlikely I will be able to come back. I am disappointed we don't have this restaurant close to home."}
{"text":"First time eating here with the family and i was very satify with the food. Its nice to try different sushi for once cause most AYCE sushi almost serve the same thing over and over however this place was different. I do however wish they had octopus sashimi, it one of my favorite."}
{"text":"I don't know what happen ever since they move to Ipad menu the quality of food has gone down a lot. I use get excited thinking about coming here. Not so much anymore.




Previous Review 2015 with 4 Stars:

I've been to this place numerous of times. It is one of the better tasting sushi places with all you can eat near the downtown core. The food to me was either a hit or a miss at times, however they often they nail it.  

They have a great variety of food, and staff is friendly and the service pretty quick.
If they miss an item that you ordered just let the server know and they be on it asap.

A thumbs up for me."}
{"text":"This place is the best in the city.. ive been here 4 times in 2 weeks .. service is amazing and adam is a very attentive and fun manager making sure myself and anyone I come with is well takin care of and always gives advice of must have foods.. this is a must go place dont miss out its amazing .."}
{"text":"I love this place. Probably not the best sushi in town, but I highly recommend. The place atomsphere and design is amazing. Very clean place, washroom as well.
Servants are very friendly. Food presentation and taste I could give it 8.5/100
Try the shrimp with orange its my fav. They open on holidays. Portion is filling..
Well-done!"}
{"text":"My favorite AYCE sushi in the city after pretty well all my favorite places closed or had such dips in quality that I no longer wanted to go there. Fushimi is a gem however. The sashimi is fresh, beautifully cut and served on ice, the tartare and ceviche dishes are delicate and lovely with pops of acidiy and pepper depending on what you order. Presentation is creative and interesting and the food is always novel with a large menu as well as weekend and seasonal specials that change every so often. Cheese mussels are unexpected but creamy and divine. My personal favorite, the walnut shrimp. The tables have tablets on them for easy ordering and the atmosphere is usually boisterous (which is a plus to me but some diners prefer quiet places). Line ups are frequent and rightfully so!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times now and LOVE this place. Service is super, food is super and presentation...... super.

Very friendly staff and great selection of food. Not one thing bad to say about this place, I hope other people thing the same and keep their business vibrant! 5/5"}
{"text":"TOXIC CONTAMINATION.

While the food is quite good and the service is...okay (the servers look tired,  unhappy, and overworked), there's a significant downside to this restaurant that far far outweighs any positive attributes.  When orders are sent out to patrons' tables, the chef places thermal receipts directly on top of the food (pay attention when you're there and you'll see for yourself).  The servers quickly remove the receipts as it gets to your table.  I used to go here a lot until I realized this was happening.

What's the problem with thermal receipt paper touching food you ask?  Bisphenol A (BPA) or it's cousin, Bisphenol B, is in thermal paper and comes off pretty easily onto food it touches.  What's wrong with BPA you ask?  It's an extremely potent endocrine distributor linked to a myriad of health problems...even in extremely low doses.  And at Fushimi, you're getting a fairly large dose.

Don't take my word for it, check out the links below:
https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/just-how-harmful-are-bisphenol-a-plastics/
http://www.newsweek.com/2015/03/13/bpa-fine-if-you-ignore-most-studies-about-it-311203.html

I brought this concern to the server's attention but they ignored it and continue the practice...so I'm never going there again...and if you truly care about your health, you won't either."}
{"text":"This place is closed. Tried to call to make reservations and no one picked up. When we arrived there was notice advising that it is shutdown. Visited December 5, 2914 7pm."}
{"text":"I'm very confused by all the strong reviews on here, but I did see one that mentioned dinner was much better than lunch. 

Lunch was .. terrible. Don't come here. The sushi rolls don't fit in your mouth, and you don't want to eat them even if they do. The mango pudding was watery and the red bean ice cream was powdery. The ingredients are clearly poor quality and no love was put into these sushi - which is not okay even if it's cheap. I've had much better at this price point."}
{"text":"I have been to Fushimi countless times with my girlfriend. Never got disappointed. This restaurant is by far the best Sushi place I have been. In terms of the Food. No complains, they make really really good shrimps and cooked beefs. Favorite sushi: Black Dragon Roll and Spicy Salmon Sushi. And when you open up the menu, take the top 3 from the first page. I rarely pay attention to the names but they are their house specials. Very Good! 

In terms of services, I will tell you a story. On a valentine's day, I took my girlfirend to Fushimi around 7PM, it was jam packed with people. In order to accommodate customers, the restaurant hosted more tables near the entrance. Well, there was an empty table right beside the gate when we arrived. It was winter and really cold. Every time someone opens the door, the wind blew me away. So I asked the waiter to check if there was any other table. Well, I knew it was packed because I could tell how many people were there and I knew the wait time was approximately 40 minutes. But I didn't want to ruin the special night on the valentine's day, so I asked anyway. The waiter asked me to wait and he called someone who made a reservation. It turned out to be that guy cancelled the reservation but did not notify the restaurant. Bang, suddenly there was an empty table in the inner area which was warm. And he told me I could take that seat since I checked with him. I was soooooo happy~~~~~~~~~.  

I usually went to Fushimi for their dinners. It was a bit pricey, $22. But it was worth it with the food you get. AYCE by the way. This is also a good restaurant to choose when there is a large group social event. Say a group of 8 friends hangout together. Fushimi can arrange tables into a very long row and they can do this quickly. Weekday such as Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday are perfect days for large group gathering because I don't usually see that many customers on these days. Oh, when you call in to make reservation, you need to be patient with the server because her English is not that fluent. But I believe she improved over the years. Lol"}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite AYCE sushi place and it's quite cheap. They have a lot of varieties (A bit disappointed there wasn't tobiko sushi) and have ramen too! They also give a jug of iced water. Their chicken is the best chicken ever, it's so soft and it's even softer than the onions in the fried rice! I recommend this place :)"}
{"text":"Nice service, great cost benefit. Fresh fish. Weekends all you can eat = $24/person. Grand opening special 15% off."}
{"text":"I honestly have to say I've been to a lot of sushi places and this restaurant has to be my all time favourite. There was never a problem with their service, they are quick and the foot comes out fresh. The price is what you pay for. The proportions are on point and I'm always left satisfied!"}
{"text":"This is the TERRIBLE story 


I have been the restaurant since it opened. I was a regular customer taking many of my friends in University of Toronto going twice a month at least. Sometimes I had the dinner menu for lunch for treating my guests. When the restaurant opened it was the best around the downtown. I thought. 

BUT! What I realized was the rice in the sushi was getting bigger, the hand rolls were getting less crispy, and the taste of the noodles was getting worse. Last time when I took 9 people on Monday lunch, the food was the worst. I was embarrassed  so much but I told my friends that it might be because of Monday lunch after busy weekend.

Then today it is Canada day thus I went there with my son again with high hopes.

But when I sat on the chair the waitress, she told me her name is Hebe, whom I have seen from the first time I came, did not ask what to drink then just brought cold water. 
 
When we ordered the food, she snatched the order sheet. When I had the sushi I could not chew a whole piece of the sushi at once because the rice was too much. I separated rice from the fish to eat easily and ate them as much as I could at once. I thought I could eat the rice with other dishes slowly.

Then the waitress took out the plate which I did not yet finish with saying  \"If you don't like sushi you can order the dinner for eating sashimi.\"

What the heck is she talking about? She thought we ordered the sushi for eating sashimi? My son and I are sushi lovers.  We ordered 12 pieces of sushi for 2 people. And 2 pieces of them were egg and 1 piece was kani, which was artificial crab meat. 

Thus, we had only 9 pieces of sushi made of fish for two people. We did not order sushi for eating sashimi. Sashimi is different from sushi fish as I used to have it there.

It was because I could not eat the sushi as  the rice was too much to eat at once.
If I left the rice, the manager could charge me for that. But I did not finish my eating yet. 

I asked her why she snatched my order sheet. Then she answered it was because she was so busy as there were only two waitresses in the restaurant although I saw three. 

She told me that if I had anything to tell her, I should tell the manager. Then she came to the chefs and complained with loud voices. 

What the rude waitress she was! 

I was even embarrassed with her behavior: who were  the customers and who should complain about the service? Is it acceptable because she was so busy that she serviced customers terribly and acted like that? Does it make sense? is the terrible service okay if the waitress was busy?

My son reminded me of the other kind waiters and waitresses we usually met before in Fushimi. 

This waitress made my feeling terrible. The manager should train her how to work for the customers properly."}
{"text":"I used to love this place before i saw a fucking mouse on the floor running around while i was eating....never going there again!! Disappointed"}
{"text":"Worth the price? - Yes. 
This is an All-you-can-eat Sushi so we did not expect much from it, turned out surprisingly good for the food quality and variety, we liked the weekend special menu. 

I strongly recommend calling them in advance so you can get seated shortly."}
{"text":"It is my proffered all you can eat sushi in downtown Toronto so far. The food is decent and the service is fast including the modern iPad menu. The venue is nice and clean. I like the traditional Salmon Roll which I find it not too bad! I've to this place several times and I'll keep coming."}
{"text":"This place was amazing at first place. Their quality is getting bad though. Last time, I had to wait about 40 minutes for a dish and it ruined my entire dinner. Also, the food isn't fresh or good anymore."}
{"text":"Food quality - Above average. Sashimi is quite fresh and the food taste is slightly above average. Though mostly just sweets, nothing new or crazy.

Food variety - Great. There are many items which are uncommon between AYCE sushi here in Toronto and GTA. If you are looking for something new, give this place a try. 

Service - How do i put this... Its about the same as those busy chinese restaurants in China town. Where food is thrown onto the table while the waitress doesn't even care about the customer. They were not busy, there is zero excuse for this poor level of service.

Would recommend as the food choices are great and they dont taste bad. My set of server might be terrible, yours could be better. If that is the case, then it is a pretty nice AYCE Sushi."}
{"text":"A pretty decent AYCE. Came with a party of 8 and orders were taken really quickly. Food also arrived very promptly. My favorite part was the oysters. They offer a lot of things that other AYCE places do not. However, I am not sure if I will be going back. Not because its bad but because AYCE is just getting expensive and I rather eat good quality a-la-carte"}
{"text":"Came here with family for a birthday and though the price was higher than other AYCE sushi places, it was probably worth it, though we would not indulge like this very often at $23 a head. It seemed that service was quicker for the hot items and desserts than for sushi, sashimi, and rolls, but perhaps more people ordered sushi.  Was very impressed with variety and taste of dinner menu items included in the AYCE, the variety of the rolls especially. Had silly little items such as a small piece of fish with a bit of sauce served on a Pringle chip, and deep-fried scallops with a dollop of katchup on them. Come hungry and as I recommend for every AYCE joint, go with friends to maximize the number of unique items you can order and be able to taste more of a variety. Try to make a reservation if you will be more than three people- the place was packed and it was a Tuesday night (albeit the week of Christmas)."}
{"text":"Decent AYCE restaurant.  Limited vegetarian sushi options though what I ordered was tasty - veggie blast roll with sweet potato and avocado and honey wasabi sauce.  Veggie handrolls were decent, not overfilled with rice.  Vegetable teriyaki was flavourful though not authentic - stir fried broccoli with garlic and a few chunks of carrot, zucchini and mushroom.

Dessert options were typical ice cream flavours - green tea, mango, red bean as well as mango pudding and mango yogurt.  I opted for the latter which was a small shot glass of plain yogurt topped with mango puree.  Yummmm..

Service was prompt and efficient with no missed dishes.  I do wonder how long they will stay in business.  Noticed they removed their hibachi option and the teppanyaki tables.  I miss their previous incarnation - Taste of Japan.  It always seemed to be busy so not sure what happened."}
{"text":"Excellent AYCE! (based on the one's that I've tried at least). Fushimi has all the essential requirements of a good AYCE:
- iPad ordering system
- fast service (food arrives very quickly to the table)
- Everything ordered comes to the table
- The food actually looks like the pictures on the menu!
- Leaf symbol beside vegetarian items (lol!)

What I especially liked about Fushimi was the variety they had on the menu. A couple of friends and I visited for lunch and we were surprised that the lunch menu was so large and comprehensive. For a price of only ~$15, we had soo many options to choose from and so many different speciality rolls, which I thought would only be available for dinner. There was also an option to get the bill and split the bill using the iPad which I thought was very cool. Minimizes human interaction even more, which for some people might be a bonus. 

The food itself was also really tasty. Not only did it arrive hot to the table (which I'm always a stickler for) but it was fresh and flavourful :)

Would definitely return!"}
{"text":"Came on Friday night for all you can eat sushi. It was very nice , with a good selection of dishes including seasonal and some that are only available on weekends. The calamari was good as was some other sushi rolls."}
{"text":"Probably the best AYCE in town. End up eating here at least couple times a month. The shrimp yakitori, spicy crab salad, walnut shrimp and salmon naruto must be given a try. The only downside is the lack of vegetarian options."}
{"text":"This sushi spot is great! I came here with a friend and it was a great time. We left feeling 100% satisfied and full. There all you can option is the way to go. I loved loved loved the tapanyaki and sweet potato tempura :) such good flavour!service  was fast for a busy night. The interior is a fun lively atmosphere perfect for a night out:)"}
{"text":"Lunch menu for $10 with free ice cream. The maki rolls have decent amount of fish(meat) in them.  Good quality food and well priced. Will be back"}
{"text":"Only tried the AYCE menu here - 22.99 on weekdays and 25.99 on weekends. It's the only AYCE downtown that I go to and was introduced to it by some good friends who only eat sushi here. I find it reasonably priced considering the variety of sushi, sashimi, apps and other signature dishes. 

Must try:
Walnut shrimp
Pepper salmon
Truffle white tuna
Any of the sashimi - it's served over ice which is a nice touch
Short ribs
I love eel so anything with eel!

On weekends this place is packed! On weekdays it's not so bad but you miss out on some of their weekend specials. Service depends on how busy they are but they try to be as quick as possible. It's good for big groups as well."}
{"text":"I have a bit of concern after reading the reviews about how dirty the place is.
It's not bad, but the lights and the entire space does makes you feel like you are in a place that is about to get shut down...

The food was fair. Some items are pretty good, like the fresh oyster, and the sashimi in the special sauce.
Some other food items had a really good concept, and/or looks great, but failed as you can't pick it up in one piece to eat, it falls apart as you touch it.

The way they push out the orders are really bad. They group all the same type of food and cook them together. So if you ordered few different deep fried items, you will have wait for enough order, then the kitchen will cook them all at once.
You will have 6 different deep fried food at the end of your meal.
(You can see the same type of food or exactly same food items came out of the kitchen all at once, and they get send to ALL the tables.)

It's another place that's not too bad, but I probably won't visit again..."}
{"text":"Had AYCE lunch there, food was ok, not as amaizing as could be listed on the best Toronto sushi buffets, but not bad too. If you just want to go sushi buffet then it's a go-to place."}
{"text":"Went to eat here on a Monday night for their all you can eat dinner.  We walked in and it took forever for someone to acknowledge us and seat us.  Before I could even sit down the waitress asked me \"what do you want to drink, water, beer?\". Not even a hello.  I ordered water and she vanished without even offering us a drink menu, or explaining the all you can eat menu to us.  

We found the the paper you order the all you can eat off of and ordered a few things.  It took the waitress 20 mins to pick up our sheet of paper and it was because we finally flagged her down.  We wanted to order wine but before we could open our mouth she disappeared.  We had to get up and order the wine from another waiter.  

The food came in a timely fashion.  The sashimi was frozen solid, for some reason they thought it was appetizing to serve it on ice.  The rest of the food however was delicious.  Especially the \"chef's creations\"; salmon civiche, pepper tuna.  The rolls were good as well.  The fushimi roll wasnt my thing, the mango in it was very sweet, but other people seemed to enjoy it, so it may just be a personal taste thing.  Half way through our meal we flagged down a waitress (which was almost impossible) to check on our wine, which we still hadn't received.  She came back and said \"its almost done\"...?

We finished our food, and wanted to order more but it was so hard to get a waitress we decided to just leave.  Our wine never came. The food was good except for the frozen sashimi, Too bad the service was probably the worst I've ever experienced."}
{"text":"Maybe it was the company mixed with the food, but it was a fantastic experience for us and I would highly recommend this restaurant! We made a reservation for a table of 6 the day before (we were lucky and were able to get a 7pm reservation on Friday night). 

Upon arrival, we were slightly concerned with the sign on the door that said \"Conditional Pass\". The inside, including the tables and corners, could be a bit cleanier. Otherwise, there were no other problems with our dinner. The food was delicious! It's AYCE, so especially great for those would live off sashimi. Service was quick, we were given an Ipad to order from and never had an issue with our order or the quantity. 

If I recall correctly, if you are a student or pay cash, you get 10% off!"}
{"text":"I'd been here before (twice) and not had a problem. My most recent trip here, however, was with a group of friends (around 10 people) at maybe 7pm on a Tuesday. We waited about an hour to have something other than chicken wings and sashimi arrive at our table. When we asked what happened to the other items we ordered, they told us it was coming and to wait. At a certain point, they started telling us that they were our of the other items we ordered and that we should order other things. 

At one point, two of the members of the party (one of which was vegetarian) had to leave in 30 minutes for a meeting, so told the front desk that they weren't going to pay for their meal, as none of the items they ordered arrived at our table. 10 minutes after saying this, two orders of each vegetarian item we had ordered and more kept on coming to our table (I thought they were out of this stuff)! 

Another half hour into the meal, I asked to receive a discount for the table, because we had only really received 1/10 of the items we ordered. This triggered just everything we ordered to come to our table twice (again, they said they were out of this stuff before!!).  We ended up getting a 15% discount (though i feel we deserved more). 

TL;DR, the food was good, and above average for an AYCE sushi place, but they really need to up their service game. Typically I don't have a problem with the service, but just be wary that they do have off nights (as described above)."}
{"text":"Okay super weird experience. This sushi place isn't bad. The only problem was that me and my boyfriend felt like we were gonna fall asleep during the meal. 
We ordered the all you can eat lunch. The sushi itself was good but after a few rolls, we were like wtf I'm sleepy right now
I don't know what they put in their sushi but we were going to fall asleep. So we quickly left after. 
We even asked ourselves if it was us.
No, we didn't eat that much, we eat even more at other sushi restaurants. 
No, we had enough sleep the night before 
3 stars because the sushi taste was decent"}
{"text":"I went here for à la carte and was disappointed. The food was only so-so and they served us brown lettuce, which I couldn't appreciate as it's not hard to remove a brown piece. The service was horrendous when we arrived. We (there were two of us) were told we couldn't sit at a particular table because it was for groups. Two minutes later, the waitress sat an individual dinner there. We ordered tea, but they only brought one and then forgot about the second. The servers did not check-in with us and would dump our plates on the table and run before we could say anything. It was still before the dinner rush, so I'm not sure why they couldn't have offered better service throughout the meal.
For the first time in my life I was tempted to not leave a tip. Luckily two of the four servers were nice, so I felt compelled. I'm not likely to return."}
{"text":"I went to Fushimi with a few friends for AYCE lunch and I thought it was a great experience! I really liked their iPad ordering system and the food exceeded my expectations. I'm usually not a fan of AYCE because they're not vegetarian-friendly, but there was a huge variety for everyone. Great value for the quality of food and service."}
{"text":"The best AYCE Sushi downtown. 

After discovering this restaurant, I have visited once a week, for six weeks in a row (I think I over did it, so currently taking a break but will be back soon). 

There is great variety - Beef tataki, salmon tataki, seared salmon, baked mussels, and i'm always the most excited for EEL SASHIMI. The eel variety is unseen-of: there's black dragon roll, eel roll, eel sushi, and eel sashimi. This is the only retaurant that truly understands my eel needs. For dessert, they also offer black sesame ice cream and pudding, MANGO YOGURT, Mango pudding, and Tiramisu. 

The iPad ordering system is efficient - orders come out extremely quickly and before I know it, the table is full of food. Because most communication is done through the iPad, you could go through the entire dinner only exchanging a few words with the staff. 

Food is insta-worthy - the sashmi is placed over a bowl of ice. Definitely keeps it fresh longer, and looks much more appetizing. Skewers are poked into an orange peel and plate is garnished with sauce and fruits. 

Tip: visit on the weekend for the dinner menu and make a reservation! I've also visited during lunch, and weekday dinner and the menu is not as extensive."}
{"text":"Heading in and seeing the iPads on the table had me thinking that it would be very much like every other generic AYCE joint. I was quite surprised that it was a little different from most places I've been to. They had a few more dishes on the fresher side (cucumber skin rolls) and salmon sashimi ceviche (different from real ceviche) as well as salmon sashimi steak. The space and dining experience was calm and roomy which gave it a very warming vibe. The food came out in a timely fashion and the whole experience was great. I would definitely recommend people who love AYCE and getting their money's worth."}
{"text":"Great all you can eat sushi spot. It's a nice ambiance. The service could be a bit more friendlier, but overall pretty decent with the service. It's location is pretty nice as well since it's by the village - lots of places to go or things to do before or after eating. Easily accessible by TTC, though you do have to walk for about 5 minutes once exiting the station. 

I would come back here again with a few friends since it's not as busy compared to other AYCE sushi spots."}
{"text":"This is definitely one of the best ayce japanese restaurants downtown. I really like the variety they have on their menu even though we only came for their weekend lunch ($16 before tax). I'm a huge fan of their iPad ordering system and we got everything we ordered. One criticism I have is their portion sizes. One order of maki rolls and a lot of their hot dishes were huge, which makes it hard to try a variety of food if you're going with just 2 or 3 people."}
{"text":"This place is close to where I live, I come here from time to time for lunch. The restaurant itself is clean and the service is pretty quick. I haven't tried the all you can eat, but the lunch specials are great, good bang for your buck. Only critique is that their sashimi isn't the best, not to say it isn't good (especially the tuna)."}
{"text":"Not bad, not bad. A little bit steep with the $14.99 ayce lunch since nearby competitors only cost about $12.99 but the overall value was satisfying. 

Although they do a wonderful job with plating and making their dishes look fancy, I must say I have an issue with the SIZE of their plates in comparison to the size of their tables. As a party of 6, I felt like we were constantly rushed to eat everything because we had nowhere to put the oncoming dishes. Granted, service was fairly fast because we had just arrived when the \"business worker lunch rush\" just ended at around 1:30pm.

That aside, the food was pretty good. I'm always skeptical of ordering sushi because of nonproportional sashimi to rice ratios but they did a pretty good job of keeping the system fair and not trying to exploit us by stuffing us with rice. The cooked foods were also alright, the teriyaki calamari was quite tender. There's nothing spectacular about this place that I would want to mention but nothing that I would warn against either.

So would I come back? Maybe. I wouldn't crave for it but I wouldn't be opposed to it either."}
{"text":"I'd say it's the best AYCE sushi place in downtown. Great selection of food and great quality as well.

I've tried almost all the AYCE sushi places in downtown already. Fushimi was hands down the best in terms of quality. 

Fushimi is our go to place when we have a few hungry guys who want sushi."}
{"text":"Fushimi has definitely went downhill. I received a plate to put the shared sushi on and the plate was dirty with some dried onion. I asked for a second plate which was dirtier than the first so I just tried to wipe it as clean as possible.

The first serving of seafood udon was delicious with perfect seasoning but the second was filled with a ton of black pepper. Maybe to purposely make us drink more water?

The sushi rolls came out with a TON of rice. Our salmon rolls took a while to come out but it was probably because they were making a new batch of rice to accompany the sashimi slices. There was way too much rice. For $15.99/adult why not make your high quality sushi the centrepiece instead of stacking a ton of rice?

The special rolls did not taste all that special. The veggie special roll had burnt fried yam in it. And again, they had a ton of rice in it.

Service was mediocre, food came and went. I do not think I will be returning."}
{"text":"Fushimi is my go to ayce AND take out. Their prices for both ayce and take out are reasonable. They have a good selection for the ayce menu. What I love about their ayce that I want to point out is their udon fried noodles and udon soup, I love the portion of their sushi (most places put a lot of rice and a very thin slice of fish on top), and their sashimi are nicely cut and fresh. They have a great selection for their take out menu. I just went there yesterday at got their take out lunch special which was $10 for 18 pieces of sushi which also came with miso soup and salad. My boyfriend and I love it! Their service can be slow at times so when I'm dining in I always have to be sure I'm not in a rush. I rate them 4 star for the food itself such as the freshness, presentation etc, decor, and reasonable price. They would've gotten a 5 star from me if their service was a little better (such as quick service, friendly staff, etc)"}
{"text":"I celebrated my anniversary with my significant other. We did not enjoy the teppanyaki as it is not traditional.

Traditional teppanyaki occurs when the chef cooks on a grill on your table and performs mini tricks. These includes tossing a raw egg up and slicing it open with the spatula or  turner full tang. The excitement from the live show while enjoying the chef's tasteful dishes is amazing!

On the contrary, teppanyaki at Fushimi does one-time ordering. Thus, customers orders what they want all at once and the \"chef\" cooks it. We ordered just enough for the two of us, little did we know, the chef places all the different kinds of meat and rice/noodle all at once on different sections of the grill. We witnessed the drippings from the beef merging with the shrimps and so forth. It was disgusting and of course cross contamination. 

The supposedly cooked food was served on our plates surprisingly neatly. We were pleased with the shrimp and chicken but not exceptionally pleased with their so-called \"AAA beef\". It was over cooked and the striploin was not seasoned. 

I ended talking to the manager on floor about our experience. He just made me another piece of AAA striploin. It was medium-rare just how I visioned it but the meat was still tough. Clearly, it was not AAA beef. 

I did not enjoy the service either. Most of the workers lacked in proper customer service and knowledge of their own dishes. 

For future reference, DO NOT CHEAP OUT ON TEPPANYAKI! They charge less than other teppanyaki restaurants!"}
{"text":"This place has good food. In fact I think it's the best AYCE downtown from what I've had. However do not come here for lunch. Absolutely terrible. It's not even close to their dinner offering. It's like a completely different restaurant. The amount of rice they use in the rolls DOUBLE. I had to pick off the extra rice off each piece. If I put it all onto a plate, my servings alone would fill an entire dinner plate of that extra rice. Menu is limited (though not bad), but the quality is just awful. The price for lunch is already the most expensive out of any other AYCE down here at $16 a person on a weekday. To make it worse this is the only AYCE I've been where a server comes around every table to tell you there's one last call before lunch is over (it was 3:13pm). Other places let lunch customers finish their meal regardless of how long they stay and just start the dinner menu for customers that walk in after the lunch cutoff. Disappointing. 

TL;DR: Don't ever come here for lunch. Tastes like a different restaurant. Double rice on rolls. Stick with dinner."}
{"text":"The best AYCE sushi place in Toronto!
I've been here many times, and still my favorite"}
{"text":"Had dinner at Fushimi last night finally. I was first impressed with the menu (many pages with some unique dishes).  The quality of food was so-so overall. I was very disappointed when the spicy salmon sushi arrived, they were falling apart - not enough rice and was poorly done. Quite a few dishes we ordered didn't come and we needed to keep asking them to check our order; however the girl who served us was very nice. Another thing that I wasn't very pleased with was pops were not included, it was fine since some other places don't have have pops on the menu, but there was no refill. For the price I paid ($20.99), I believe there are many more better choices. Probably won't go back again."}
{"text":"Fushimi, the Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon of AYCE

Tucked away from the rest of the AYCE, Fushimi is a  AYCE by itself. It ranks #2 on my best J-AYCE here is why. 

PROS: 
Wait Times, Quickly seated, orders came promptly after ordered 
Food, everything is freshly made and presented, Hot foods were searing, cold foods were chilled appropriately.  
Sashimi (beautify presented over ice with lightings, perhaps the most unique way to serve Sashimi at is finest)  
Comforting Japanese style dining environment, Service was great 
Versatile and Flexible ordering style (lots to choose from and you name the quantity)
Very good impression on first Visit instantly hit on my top 3! 
Website (worth browsing at, it speaks for itself)  

CONS:
Price: anything on the top deserves the premium price tag, 
Some of the dish portions are surprisingly large (you realize that too late, when its on your table :P) 

Overall a stand alone unique approach to AYCE, Not my usual Japanese AYCE place to go but definitely worth the stop if in the area."}
{"text":"First, the service is really not great. At all. They will ignore you for ages. Even though you were seated and haven't ordered yet. Then they will bring you the wrong things. They will bring you rolls and tereyaki before sashimi or tempura or other apps. And the images of special rolls on the menu, some of them differ from what the roll looks like in real life...?

Second, the rolls were alright. A bit too much rice and unevenness in the sizes of the pieces. I might be nitpicking now.

The rest of the food (non-sushi) was also just okay. We didn't actually do AYCE because part of our group didn't want to (and your whole group needs to do one or the other). The prices were okay considering we hadn't done AYCE. But I feel like there are better options within walking distance that this place does not need to be frequented by me.

It also seems like they are open to dine and dash? We asked for the bill. It came, separated like requested, half an hour later. No mention of weather they will come to the table or we should go to the desk. So another 20 mins go by before we are told that we should go up to the front. This sort of stuff is really a turn off. Especially considering they weren't really busy. Definitely did not make a fan out of me."}
{"text":"Good food for the price. Your better than average AYCE sushi downtown. iPads to order, service is pretty good even when busy. Try it!"}
{"text":"Came here with a few coworkers and didnt expect much because in my opinion the AYCE sushi restaurants dt are hit and miss and less than average compared the ones north of the city. However, after doing a bit of research in Yelp, I decided to give Fushimi a shot based on fairly decent reviews.

LOCATION: conveniently located within walking distance to Wellesley subway station

AMBIENCE: modern decor with lots of tables, nice quiet atmosphere and perfect for large groups

FOOD: there was a wide selection of AYCE menu items to choose from for the price of $21.99 on weekdays; the sashimi was fresh and nicely cut, the rolls were also tasty and unique; the cooked items on the other hand were fairly decent, was disappointed with the beef short ribs and beef teriyaki as i've had better BUT the shrimp yakitori was delicious. There was a decent dessert selection including mango pudding, black sesame pudding and tiramisu. Also, the presentation of the sashimi and rolls was pretty immaculate considering most ayce places just throw the items on the dish.

SERVICE: subpar service but what do you expect from an AYCE restaurant

Definitely would consider coming back for an AYCE meal downtown!"}
{"text":"I would give it 1.5 stars if I can. Came here with a couple of friends for a weekday AYCE lunch ($14.99). I liked the décor - it felt pretty modern and comfortable. The iPad ordering isn't anything new but convenient nonetheless. 

The food was decent, nothing special at all. I usually don't like cheese wontons but they mixed something in the cream cheese that made it pleasant to consume. However, the sushi and the rolls were a completely different story. The fish was not fresh at all, it felt like it was frozen for a while and they defrosted it way too fast - there was no flavour and the colour was too light. The rice did not hold its shape and consistently fell apart. The rolls are massive, and like the rice, does not hold its shape either. If you advertise yourself as a sushi restaurant, you need to get that right or else what's the point? Also, there isn't a lot of options to choose from. Most rolls are either 6 or 8 pieces (typical) but when you're on your 2nd or 3rd round of ordering, you don't want so much. The apps or other items were pretty bland as well. What's worse is the subsequent orders for fried foods (cheese wonton, chicken nuggets, etc.) came out cold and soggy. 

I came here looking for some decent sushi as it was ranked 4th on Yelp for AYCE sushi in the downtown core, but this was a pretty big disappointment. Suffice to say, I will not be returning here anytime soon."}
{"text":"Not a bad choice among all the AYCE sushi place in downtown Toronto. Maybe a little pricy but they offer some exclusive items so if you are really into those ones then its acceptable I guess. Food quality is above average, but the service is not that good. Last time I been there, It took forever for them to bring the food to our table. I will say at least give it a try."}
{"text":"I went to have dinner ($23.99 per person for the AYCE) on a recent Saturday evening at Fushimi and I was really interested to see after reading some reviews, if Fushimi was better than there Japanese AYCE counterparts in Scarborough and Markham.

Upon entering, my friend and I were quickly seated, the place is spacious, clean and well lit.

We first ordered two oysters each which were part of the AYCE menu (max 2 per person). The oysters were fresh and a pleasant surprise.

Next came the Japanese baked mussels (2 pieces), these were well done and not too oily/greasy.

Then we had the Spicy tuna tartare, the taste was okay, nothing special but the plate presentation and creativity is something you won't see at any other AYCE Japanese restaurant.

Next up was the sashimi, the sashimi offered was your basic fare: salmon, white tuna, shrimp, red snapper, albacore tuna and a few others. It was somewhat fresh and pretty average and comparable to the offerings at others Japanese AYCE restaurants in Scarborough/Markham. The plate presentation really stood out though.

Then came the Pepper beef tataki, this dish was quite disappointing, really difficult to eat because it was way over seasoned even for a pepper dish.

We then had two of their global signature rolls:

Sex on the beach: this comprised of fresh salmon, mango, kani, avocado, cucumber & fish eggs, the rolls were fresh, tasty and well executed.

Angry roll: this comprised of fresh salmon, kani, cucumber deep fried with a special chef sauce, these rolls were okay, fresh and decent tasting.

Grilled and Fried Food:

Beef short ribs (3 pieces): Minimal meat and a lot of fat and did not have a good charring.

Steak teriyaki: The meat was really tough and not flavourful.

Chicken wings: The wings were pretty decent and barbeque flavoured and similar to what you would get at a random bar.

Shrimp tempura: The shrimp was fresh but the batter was a little on the heavy side.

Dessert:

Tiramisu: It was pretty standard and comparable to its competition since most of the Japanese AYCE restaurants outsource this dessert and are not made in house.

Black sesame ice cream: Was decent and nothing special but not all Japanese AYCE restaurants offer this flavour.

Service: 

The service was slightly above average for an AYCE Japanese restaurant, waiters were quick to take your orders but empty dishes were not quickly taken away.

Overall, I think Fushimi deserves a 3.5 star rating because I am in between A-OK and Yay I am a fan. The plate presentation and creativity of some of the dishes are quite amazing for an AYCE Japanese restaurant, some dishes in regards to taste are better than others and it is a little cheaper than itès competitors ($23.99) but one area where the food could improve quite a bit is the grilled foods."}
{"text":"I've been here twice since my last review and they haven't disappointed.  Actually, what I'm surprised is that their service is still good and the food is still good.  Usually, AYCE's go downhill after a couple of months of opening due to volume and they hire less experienced sushi chefs. This doesn't seem to be the case here.  

Servers are very good at explaining each roll to you, and presentation is impeccable (especially for an AYCE restaurant).  Now let's get real here, you aren't going to experience Omasake quality sushi here, but it is still very good.  It's probably the best AYCE sushi joint (though not the best if you include a la carte) I've been there and some of the best service.  For example, I must have had a brain cramp and ordered seven L21's (chicken yakitori) instead of seven L31's (salmon sushi).  So it got brought to us and I thought we didn't order it - they offered to take it back, which is good whereas other AYCE would be \"you have to eat it, you ordered it\".  However, it looked so delicious, that we said we would keep it.  IT WAS AMAZING!!!  It's basically tender chicken teriyaki on a skewer and then they stuff it into orange slices for presentation.  7 orders or 14 pcs shared between the four of us. I think I ate 5 or 6. haha

Props to this place and keep up the good work."}
{"text":"I've been to quite a few AYCE places before. I've got to say, this is definitely one of the top ones I've been to. You usually do not expect this kind of quality at an AYCE place either. At a price of $15.99 for lunch on Christmas, this was definitely a surprise, though not too much of a surprise, since I checked the Yelp ratings beforehand ;) Here are a couple things that really stood out to me: 

1) Sushi: fish to rice ratio was very good. My brother, who is my food connoisseur, was impressed with how the fish can droop over the piece of rice and touch the plate, as it should be for proper sushi according to him. The fish was also very flavourful and fresh. 

2) Sushi rolls: There was good variety and about 3-4 unique rolls. What made me happy was that the rolls came out warm and not cold. There was also a good amount of stuff in the middle and only a thin layer of rice. The only roll I wasn't a big fan of was the Calamari roll, which was too big and fell apart while being picked up. The mango sauce was also a strange accompaniment to the squid. 

3) Ramen was quality ramen. Usually at AYCE, you order ramen and you get some flimsy noodles with a mediocre amount of seafood/meat, maybe some lettuce, all served to you in some watery soup. Not at Fushimi. This is the same kind of ramen you could expect from an actual ramen store, with bamboo shoots and half an egg included! My only regret is that I was too full from everything else to order more. 

As someone who's from uptown, I don't venture downtown to eat too often. I might have to make an exception for this next time I want to have some really good AYCE."}
{"text":"The food here was decent. I wish I could give this place zero stars however. I went here on April 25th, and 3 days later, someone starts making purchases with my credit card and does so for a few days, until I noticed it today. I did not purchase anything with my credit card between April 25th and 28th, which is when these fraudulent transactions started occurring. Never coming back here again."}
{"text":"I loovvvee Fushimi! I've been about 3 or 4 times and have enjoyed every visit. There's quite a bit of seating inside considering how it looks a little small from the outside. 

During my most recent visit, I came for their dinner AYCE. Basically, you are seated, and there is an ipad on the table where you choose all the food you could ever hope for! They used to have little paper slips to make you're order on, but it looks like they've upgraded to ipads, which makes ordering numerous times much more convenient! 

The portion of each ordered itwm is a bit on the smaller side which in my opinion is a good thing since this method allows you to try a larer variety of foods, even ones you potentially may not enjoy.

One of my favourite things on their menu is their walnut shrimp, it's deep fried and covered in a lovely sweet sauce, I get soooo many orders of thia every time I come!"}
{"text":"TBH. They are serving restaurant level food at AYCE. I live near this place and the fair price ($20 for AYCE lunch after tax &a tips) motivates me to pay frequent visits."}
{"text":"Its not mind blowing at all. The food is okay bordering on mediocre. The price is alright for AYCE lunch but dinner is too pricey. One redeeming quality is the freshness of the sashimi and the flavour from the spiced and rare salman and beef slices. I would come back if I had another craving for sushi and if I were in the area otherwise there are so many other places to go for better food."}
{"text":"Quality of food 3/5
Service (electronic) 3/5
Atmosphere 4/5 
Overall 3/5

The place usually gets busy past 5, but not to the point where a line forms. Food is ordered electronically and usually food is freshly made to order at the front, but the AYCE sushi portions didn't seem too fresh. The price at 26.99 you're better off going to another place"}
{"text":"Loved this place when they first opened, but the quality of the food and service has been going down. Portion sizes of sashimi have been getting smaller. When I was there in Jan 2014, they gave us salmon slices the sized of cashews. When we placed a second order of sashimi, it never came. They have a tendency of never following the orders we placed for sushi/sashimi; most of the time, they skip giving us several items and don't explain why. However, the quality of the hot foods has been maintained. I still love their beef ribs and coconut shrimps. They took some short cuts with their desserts too. Ice cream has been the same, but the other desserts like mango pudding tasted bland, and the tiramisu was in a shot glass! I am not sure if I will continue to visit this place."}
{"text":"One of the best AYCE's I've ever had - and I've been to at least 20 different ones all over the GTA/downtown/London.

The sashimi was served freshly on ice (see in my pic below).  Not only was the fish/sushi on point, but the rest of food was hot and fresh as well.  They offered a variety of unique dishes and the service was prompt too.  And just look at the presentation of the food - I know of no other AYCE that does it this well.

It's a bit of a distance from the downtown core, but I'd make the trek again!"}
{"text":"Overall, I was not pleased with this place. I came here with a large party of people. We didn't have a reservation but they were able to seat us. You can have all you can eat or order a la cart. We decided to do a la cart as we only had 1.5 hours with the table (we had to give the table back at 8 o'clock as they had reservations). The food was below average for the price that they are charging - I would even say that the sushi and sashimi was good but everything else was just not good. The service was just awful. I ordered a dinner combo and one of the items was Walnut Shrimp. One of our server's English pronunciation was not great, so nobody at our table understood that she was saying Walnut Shrimp. She repeated herself a few times and still we didn't understand her. The part that ticked me off was the way she spoke to us - she was rude and her tone of voice was condescending. In addition, the place is so under staff for an all you can eat place, you can't even get them to come over to give you more water. I might get sushi take out but I will not dine here again."}
{"text":"I went to try this place a few weeks ago with my friends. I had pretty high expectations coming in, but I left disappointed. 

Food: It was good but not spectacular. They have some unique rolls such as the Fushimi Roll and good sashimi. Overall, for AYCE, it wasn't too bad. 

Service: The waitors/waitresses were what really disappointed us. Whenever we requested for anything, they would come to us unwillingly. But what really disappointed me was that they would talk about their customers unkindly. A few of my friends came late so we stayed a bit longer than expected. When we finally left, one of my friends who was Chinese overheard the waitresses saying \"wow, they finally left\". i was shocked and appalled. 

To be honest, I don't think I would go again. The food is definitely not worth it for the terrible service."}
{"text":"Hands down best AYCE in town! Love it! The specials on nights/weekends are the best!"}
{"text":"First time there. 

Decor. Foyer is halfway decent. Inside looks like a cafeteria. Tables tightly packed together (like two feet between tables). Noisy. I've never seen Japanese restaurant with such cheap decor. Lots of people though. Entire restaurant was filled.

Service. Lots of waiters. Half of them can't see your hand raised because the cheap wood dividers separating tables blocks their vision. Orders got forgotten. Ordered soft-shell crab. They didn't have it. They neglected to tell me. They just never brought it. I had to follow up. On the upside, a lot of their waiters seem to speak fluent English.

Food. Lots of fancy food names. White tuna with truffle oil? All I could taste was the spices on the tuna. Sashimi was sliced inconsistently (some were extremely thin and some were fairly thick). Yuzu-miso sauce and tomato sauce apparently taste the same. The deep fried milk had no coconut taste. Rolls had a lot of cheap ingredients in them and the rice was sticky the way day old sushi rice is. Mango panna cotta and mango yogurt taste the same, except mango panna cotta is served in a pretty glass with fruit, topped with whipped cream and chocolate sauce. In my opinion, the mango yogurt is more worth it. More mango. Less filler. Their Japanese baked mussel is pretty good. Think mussel with alfredo sauce baked with cheese. They have avocado sashimi, which pretty much just means sliced avocado. The best thing is their sesame pudding. It's not very sweet, has just enough sesame taste and is unbelievably creamy.

For the price, I'd say this was a one-time thing. As much as I appreciated the sesame pudding, I could have had better food elsewhere."}
{"text":"Their sushi is pretty good but there's a problem with consistency in their service and pricing."}
{"text":"One of the best AYCE restaurants in downtown Toronto, the menu carries quite a bit of unique dishes that you can't find at other places, at a reasonable price. Service was pretty attentive and food came out quickly, despite how busy the restaurant was on a Friday evening. However, the rolls could've been made a little tighter, as they were falling apart easily."}
{"text":"Best AYCE sushi in Toronto.  Food is high quality.  But too crowded and could be cleaner.  But overall can't complain bc food quality."}
{"text":"Great restaurant, price is very good, very clean, and the sushi was fantastic! One of the best AYCE sushi joints in Toronto ."}
{"text":"This place is the brand spankin'(ish) new place in the village.

It's the first on the strip to do AYCE sushi. The bears in the village are going to looooooooooooooooooooooooove this.

But I'm torn. Here's a list of what went down guyz. 

Trust me yo, it'z a ride.

PRO'z

1. The food presentation. I have never been to an AYCE joint that has put that much effor into presentation. It's a great effort. But let's get real, it just opened.

2. They have some really imaginative makis. Definitely try the veggie blast. Who knew I could love veggies so much? (OMG I hope Val G doesn't see this)

3. Super super friendly service.

4. Ticket system, but it's kinda basic. You just write down the item number and how many pieces you'd like.

CONz.

1. Okay so first things first. We got in there for lunch. It looked nice. Until we sat down. There were really funky booths, but the seating was MAD RIPPED. Like. Did you find this booth at the dump? Come on guys. You just opened! Atleast reupholster that shiz.

2. A lot of the grilled items we got tasted mad stale. The beef teriyaki was inedible. 

3. We went around 11.45 to the place for lunch, and it said it opened at 11.30. We waited a good 15 minutes outside because one of the staff asked us to wait. Then the owner came out looking really confused and sat us down. Not really a con, just a curiousity. I got a couple of smokes in, na biggz.


Here's my final verdict about this place:


I dunno if it's going to stick around that long. Try it out while it's there. They have a 10% off special going right now.

Definitely try all the fancy makis. Its worth it. 

Other than that, it's not the best. It's not the worst either."}
{"text":"Ohhh no... What happened!!?!?!
This was my favourite AYCE sushi in Toronto and it changed.  I went today to find that they added this cool iPads for ordering. This definitely amped up their service where the food comes so quickly but we lost the great food and playing of the food.

The sushi rolls are now humongous with 60:40 rice to content ratio. The sashimi has become tiny and plated regularly. The hot food lost their charm and heat where it seemed microwaved.  The price also seems to have gone up slightly as well.  

I wonder if they had a change in management..."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch AYCE.

The atmosphere was really nice, music wasn't too loud and tables were seated rather nicely.  Service is fast enough, you receive a paper order menu, and write down what you want (not as cool as the ipad menus, but effective nonetheless).  

Took about 3 minutes for the first appetizer to arrive, and the rest of the food came together about 5 minutes later. Quality wise, it's just okay.  What you'd expect from a sushi all you can eat.  The rolls were quite similar to the quality you'd get from 168 Sushi or Heart Sushi.  

Interesting dessert item: black sesame pudding.  Had the taste of black sesame ice cream, but lacked the sweetness (could have been due to the fact that I was eating it with ice cream). Since it was my first time having it, I could not tell if that was the way it is supposed to be.  I will admit that it looked disgusting; dark grey jiggly sludge. 

Overall a fairly decent experience, for about 15.00 before tax."}
{"text":"Food was very eh. I know all you can eat sushi is often a bit dodgy, the photos on the menu looked great then when we ordered them they were less than spectacular. 

We have a negative experience before entering the restaurant, as a male prostitute was sitting on their front stoop wearing a speedo attempting to solicit. 

No one from the restaurant seemed to mind. Weird

Anyways, for mediocre all you can eat do aji sai instead."}
{"text":"1. Everything except sushi taste really bad, steak and calamari taste like nothing 
2. Foods so slow, we wait for like an hour and the order never came 
3. Don't recommend this place, not worth it."}
{"text":"We visited Fushimi after reading the rave reviews on yelp and unfortunately, we were slightly dissapointed by the food. They have a large selection of AYCE food but there is nothing that really stands out. They do offer a larger than average array of choices when it comes to hot/kitchen food as well as rolls but when it comes to the fish, whether in sashimi or in nigiri, there are just the usual ones.

Sashimi is served on a bed of ice, which was nice but it kinda gave the fish a \"just defrosted\" texture which isn't the best. We also had mackeral that was way \"fishier\" than average and asked the waitress maybe if they could check the fish to see if it is still fresh but she told us that that's the way the fish tastes like ... If every institution did that and something was indeed not fresh, how would be be able to know? Rolls were too big in our opinion: between the two of us, we couldn't even finish 3 rolls... Food from the kitchen was also very oily which at the end of our meal made us feel uneasy. 

Overall, they do have a larger array of options but I think I'd rather stick to an ayce with less choices but better quality food such as gallery sushi."}
{"text":"This might just be another one of my favourite AYCE Sushi restaurants. The place is quite big and mellow the music isn't loud and the service is pretty good. The food is above average and it comes very fast. I would definitely recommend this place if you like sushi and are open to new restaurants."}
{"text":"while I enjoy the food, waiting for 20 minutes after completing our meal for our bill is a bit much, the server asked us if we were ready for the bill and he has passed our table 4 times now and still no bill..."}
{"text":"I won't recommend this restaurant at all, I used to think this restaurant is worth to eat and come again. But now I guess they change the server, the food taste ok, but the server or that particular manger has a very bad temper, she even curse me at my back although is in Chinese but yet I can still understand which I am not appreciated and certainly won't come back again. I even bring my friends here and told them it's good place. Now it's just embarrassing me

If you like to know how the female server looks like:
Long black hair with pony tail
Left risk have a silver watch/ may be a bracelet
Position should be higher rank that server could be a manger, because she always tell other people what to do
And one more thing she look younger than other servers"}
{"text":"Went back but was disappointed. A day after the dining there both my wife and I felt a bit queasy. We discussed this with friends and they shared the same feeling. We were pleased by the 'highly spiced' offerings, but these probably are applied to less fresh fish. We did not explore how the tepanyaki works. 

The day following the second visit....a bit of queasiness........I could be purely coincidental, but......................

I will not return."}
{"text":"Looked on BlogTO for the best Japanese AYCEs and this came up for the downtown area. The service is great, and the ordering system was a cool new experience for me (they provide every table with an iPad). I came here for lunch with family and the food was mediocre at best. Food quality at Fork and Spoon is much better. I can't say anything about dinner as I've not tried, but the pricing for lunch is very reasonable."}
{"text":"Meh, wasn't as good as everyone says it was. The fish was pretty fresh but you could tell that the servers really didn't want to help you. 

The sashimi wasn't even cut all the way through and my date and I had to pull it apart with our forks. It was really hard to grab a waiter to come help us. 

Sushi was unique and tasty but overall service was terrible. It wasn't even a busy day..."}
{"text":"On the more expensive side for lunch,  about 20 a person but you get AYCE and to order from iPads! 

Long story short, VERY good kitchen food. But dry sushi. It's disappointing because if both were good this place would be a 4 star or more. 

Service is very good and so is the decor. Please improve your sushi and I will be back."}
{"text":"We have AYCE here, Wednesday early dinner around 5PM.  Poor customer service, waitress put my food on dirty plate instead of take the dirty plate away, like stack it on top.  Some maki will taste weird in your mouth.  Food come out tiny in a large dish presentation."}
{"text":"The best AYCE sushi place located downtown Toronto. The selection is great and filled with some unique items. Price is set at $25.99 for weekend dinner. 

Some notable dishes include: grilled mackerel, special cucumber wrapped sushi, and black sesame desserts (ice cream and pudding)."}
{"text":"Never have I, in my life, ate somewhere and wanted to run home and shower from feeling so violated, but Fushimi accomplished that. My wife and I definitely got food poisoning after eating here, our bodies couldn't flush out the spoiled food fast enough after we got served here, and other reviews here confirm that. Mere words cannot describe the disappointment that is this disgraceful establishment. Don't fall for the food pictures like we did, they're an illusion! 

Where to start? 
The service at Fushimi is horrible, when they aren't forgetting your orders, they make sure to let you know what a favour it is to be serving you. 

The place itself is nauseating, from the dirty tables to the still greasy plates, the sticky floors, hell! even the jug of water has stains at the top with some fine grease to add. 

The seafood isn't fresh, and to testify to that, we had an entire roll of SPOILED bbq eel that made me literally run to the washroom to spit it out to avoid barfing. 
The seaweed they wrap the maki rolls in are beyond chewy and stale, and the ratio of rice to ingredients are ridiculous. 
None of the sashimi was fresh. 

we couldn't, morally, tip  here, and it takes really horrendous service and food to go to that extreme for us. 

We will never be returning here and caution others to not even start going here, I've never felt this disgusted in a long while, and Fushimi did the job.

Congratulations Fushimi, for running an atrocious restaurant so consistently and against all odds."}
{"text":"This is probably one of the best... if not the best sushi place in Toronto. The rolls have a beautiful portion size. It's all very fresh. 
This is our favourite place to dine. 
Service is fast but get there early if you don't want to wait  as it is very popular. 
We have since moved out of toronto and I can not find a sushi place even close in comparison in out neck of the woods. 
I'm drooling at the thought of returning soon!"}
{"text":"Went with fairly low/mediocre expectations with the AYCE menu. Every dish we had was \"not\"disappointing! Presentation for each dish, especially for an AYCE joint was great/better than most AYCE places. Selection was varied with several items not traditionally found at other AYCE places. Sashimi was fresh/on ice when it arrived at our table. Fushimi is my go-to AYCE joint now when Im in the area without breaking the budget!"}
{"text":"Came here today after seeing the good reviews. We sat down and was handed the ayce menu, without being asked. We were not here for ayce... They brought us the normal menu without a fuss though. We ordered the fushimi plate, kama kaze roll, fushimi dragon roll and the tobiko sushi. The salad tasted like it had been out for a while. The tobiko sushi came out after and tasted fine.  We waited for our next order to come. And waited... and waited... we saw our plate on the counter ready to come but they just left it there what the heck? Finally the plate came, on a bed of flashing ice lol. At first bite we understood why they waited. It just finished unfrosting. The fish tasted watery, bland and cold.  This was supposed to be quality chef selected fish... The rolls weren't great either.  The only plus was that our waiters were kind. I had an upset stomach after as well. Most definitely won't come back."}
{"text":"This is BY FAR my most favourite sushi place in Toronto since I moved here on Canada Day!

I absolutely love the menu and how fast it is since you can use the iPad to order food efficiently and quickly (sort of). They even have pictures, so if you're noob, you can look at the pictures and see what you like and order it!

This one time, we had a really rude waitress because my friend was unsure of the portion of this one order, and she was really defensive about the order and gave us the rudest attitude, which is why I can't give a 5/5 because of this one waitress that decreased my level of respect for the restaurant... other than that, the food is delicious."}
{"text":"I came here for an early dinner with some friends on a Wednesday night. None of us had ever been before and we decided to try it out for a change from our usual sushi restaurants.

The restaurant is quite large. It is clean, spacious, modern, and dimly lit. They have both an AYCE menu (I believe around $19-20) as well as an a la carte option. We decided to order a la carte as we were a small group and not particularly hungry. The menu also has a number of unique rolls and dishes that you would not necessarily find at typical sushi bars. I ordered the following dishes:

1) Fushimi Salad ($3.5 - assorted seafood, cucumber, green onion, with homemade sauce) - the only seafood I found was bits if calamari, and it was only small pieces of tentacles, not the nice smooth pieces if the squid's body. Given that the menu said 'assorted seafood' I was also hoping for some shrimp or crabmeat, but alas, did not have any. The dressing had a bit of a kick to it, was rather salty, and there was just too much dressing - the cucumbers were drenched! I wouldn't order this dish again.

2) Shrimp Asparagus ($5 - cooked shrimp and asparagus with yuzu miso sauce) - this was four pieces of shrimp settled upon four spears of cooked asparagus. I would order this dish again and it was my favourite of the night.

3) Eggplant Roll ($4, 4 pieces - eggplant, lettuce, cucumber, with house sauce) - warning: the eggplant is tempura eggplant! I wish the menu had said this as I do not like tempura and would not have ordered this dish had I known. Nevertheless, I had one piece.

4) Cucumber Roll - because I did not like the eggplant roll, I decided to order a standard cucumber roll as it was a dish where I knew I would not be surprised with tempura again! It was a typical cucumber roll, although I found that there was too much rice (same with the eggplant roll).

My friends also enjoyed the dishes that they had ordered. The serving sizes are quite generous here and everything is presented artfully. A dish of wasabi and ginger was brought to the table before we had even ordered. I didn't particularly like this as it meant that these items were not freshly served, and these were communal dishes meant to be shared by everyone at the table.

I am struggling with what to say regarding the service. Our server was very sweet and brought water to the table immediately. Although green tea was complimentary, you had to ask for it, and it was served in typical coffee mugs, not the little green tea cups. There were definitely some language issues with our server as she was not able to explain what was in the fushimi salad and I had asked for the house sauce on my eggplant roll to come on the side, but when she brought it to the table, she explained that she had forgotten and asked if I wanted a new roll. It was hard to turn down the roll once it had already come to the table. In addition I was surprised that she didn't ask about the fact that I had only eaten one of the four pieces of the eggplant roll. It would have been appreciated if she had asked and realized that I did not like the dish and then removed it from the bill. 

Although there were a few snags in my meal, this is a restaurant I would come back to in order to try some of their other dishes.

Some additional notes:
1) They don't accept American Express
2) The bathrooms are co-ed - it's a series of single stalls with shared sinks and the stalls' doors are made of frosted glass."}
{"text":"Fushimi is definitely my favourite sushi restaurant in Toronto. The waiters are always nice and friendly. 10/10 would recommend the gyoza, teriyaki and sashimi which is always fresh. Can't wait to visit Fushimi again when I'm back in Toronto."}
{"text":"Regularly eat here, fast friendly service super customer focused!  Do a great bento box and a la. Carte sushi.

Owner regularly helps and is in restaurant.  Very reasonable $$!

Love it."}
{"text":"The sushi is fresh and well plated, it's our go-to sushi place after trying many nearby. The service is always really great, not always fast (it's always super busy so that's to be expected) but very friendly! It gets very noisy at the back so we tend to sit in the front--not so great for the hot summer or the cold winter, but the noise level is just too much to deal with in the back-this is the only reason it doesn't get 5 stars."}
{"text":"This used to be a great place around 2 years ago. Now it's a hit or miss. They used to have the best selection and quality for a Japanese AYCE place. The seasonal specials and unique items were amazing. Easily my favourite in Toronto.

But that's changed these days because it seems the owners became complacent and didn't innovate or want to improve anymore. Especially with such a competitive food scene in Toronto and so many great restaurants. To be fair they're now just mediocre, not bad, so you can still give it a try if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Food was excellent but the service was not. Had already placed my initial order when a couple came and sat down beside me. They were served over 6 plates of food before I got my second item. Servers drop off food on the corner of your table away from you, not even making eye contact to see if you need anything like extra napkins, ginger, etc. Often, servers weren't sure which table ordered what item - weird because each table is numbered and orders are sent directly to the kitchen via iPad. Chefs were excellent and everything was deliscious and plated nicely. Some common items like mango or seaweed salad were missing from the menu but a good selection otherwise."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of this place for their food but not their service. I've been here a few times, hoping their service might improve but it has been a let down every time. Upon arriving during lunch hour, they were busy, they didn't acknowledge my friends and I, and we waited for awhile to be seated. Food took longer than usual to be served (I know they're busy). We did ayce lunch and they forgot to serve some food and we ordered the second time, same thing, which was frustrating, plus the long wait. We weren't over happy with that of course. However, their food has been consistently good. Hence the 3 stars. I'd say go when it's less busy coz it ruins one's experience."}
{"text":"Great sushi for the lunch deal! The service is quick and everything tastes great. 

We even had left overs that we couldn't finish and they didn't charge us more for it!"}
{"text":"I think I might have just found the best AYCE sushi in the city!! Thanks to my Yelp friends I ended up visiting this place for lunch with my coworkers (although it's far from our office). 

We didn't have an issue with finding a table even though it was 6 of us on a Friday. The AYCE lunch is $1 extra Friday and weekends. I think it was $13+tax.

The service was a bit slow as the restaurant started filling up quickly. They had a huge party of around 20 people that day. We had to ask the waitress to get us water. They were quick in giving us the ticket to write down what we wanted. Our first order came in pretty quickly but some of the subsequent orders took so long we thought that they almost forgot them.

Salad - Tried the Fushimi salad, sounded good from the description but it was just meh. We preferred the seaweed salad.

Rolls and Sushi - We tried almost all the rolls on the menu. All I can recall is that the rice didn't have enough flavour and they were kind of stingy on the fish too.

Hot Food - The star of the lunch was the hot food here especially the teriyaki, deep fried calamari and chicken wings. We ordered quite a few wings but they didn't come for a long time. We thought that the waiters lost our order so we ordered more. And the next thing you know we got a huge pile of wings on our table. They were soo amazingly crispy, flavoured and cooked just right though that I am not going to complain about it!! 
We also loved the chicken and shrimp yakitori. All the hot food felt like it was freshly made.

As usual, there is no sashimi in the AYCE lunch menu.

Dessert - Yummm. The mango pudding was spectacular!! They have very small portions for the pudding and I could've easily eaten 4-5!!! The green tea ice cream had good flavours too but nothing different than other japanese places. 

The presentation for all the dishes was fantastic! They deserve a pat on the back for keeping up such a high standard despite being an AYCE place.

Service was not great but not terrible either. Felt like the waiters didn't care and we had to flag them down every single time we needed to order something. 

Food - 4 stars
Service  - 3.5 stars
Overall - 4 stars"}
{"text":"If I could give 0 stars I would. Just came back from fushimi with a friend and we're both experiencing symptoms of food poisoning or something was not fresh tonight. 

Service was bad. No one came to clear the table of empty dishes. Now that they use ipads they hardly check on the diners.

Food was not good. Noodles were salty, my miso soup had uncooked mushrooms. $25 for ayce I would expect better. Kyoto House had fresher food than this place.

I should have known better when they changed their menus to iPads. No restaurants with ipads are ever good (Spring Sushi)

Sincerely,
My butthole"}
{"text":"We came here for an AYCE sushi lunch at 12:30pm on a Sunday and left satisfied and a little too full! The restaurant was spacious and could seat around 40 - 50 people, but the interior was unfortunately a bit drab and didn't seem that clean. The service was nice and attentive, although they mainly focused on bringing orders of sushi to the table since Fushimi has iPads with a decently usable self-service ordering app.

We ordered a variety of items, including salmon/tuna/mackerel nigiris (4/5), chicken karaage (3/5), grilled mackerel (4/5), spicy salmon and tuna rolls (4/5), sweet potato roll (4/5 + interesting!), Philadelphia rolls (4/5), other specialty rolls, and green tea ice cream. The quality of the fish was satisfactory and it was an enjoyable feasting experience overall.

I'll admit that when I first walked into the restaurant, I was a bit worried that the fish quality would be on the low side and that our AYCE sushi would be tainted by fishiness in our food, but that wasn't the case! For a ~CA$18 per person AYCE sushi lunch, Fushimi offers a worth-it sushi experience and is definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"February 24, 2018 - This restaurant is really good and just across from Crews and Tango  .. The food was delicious better than some sushi restaurant I went to.. the quality was good also. And I ate my money's worth"}
{"text":"A solid sushi place for an all-you-can-eat sushi.   The AYCE option is available for $21.99 on weeknights and $24.99 on weekend nights.  Not a bad deal for a menu that includes *most* of the sushi, a lot of yaki tori, salads, tempura, etc. 

The FOOD:  I chose to focus my efforts primarily on the sushi.  The sushi here is of moderate quality...it definitely won't blow you away, but it's solid, and relatively fresh (I'm guessing most has been frozen at some point).  The Unagi were actually quite well done.

A big heads-up though.  The AYCE menu EXCLUDES certain sushi including all of the real TUNA (Maguro...they don't carry chu-toro or o-toro), as well as Hamachi (yellowtail), Tako (octopus), Hotate (scallop), and even their simple roll cousins like Tekka Maki (tuna rolls).  These were sadly the items I most wanted to order and felt a bit swindled that they were excluded from the AYCE menu, although I'm sure the over-fished tuna weren't too disappointed.  They have some disappointing substitutes like what they call \"white tuna\", which is really Escolar and not all that healthy anyway or albacore.  Most of the rolls on offer star Kani (imitation crab), which is something I steer clear of.

The other food items were pretty good.  The chicken Yakki-Tori were solid and interestingly enough had pretty good presentation.  Surprising to see an AYCE place that gives a crap about presentation.  

Drink menu is pretty ho-hum.  Stick to the Asahi Super-Dry, which is an excellent complement to the sushi.  Maybe it's just Ontario, but the sake on the menu was both pretty low quality and quite pricy.

The SERVICE: Hmm...I wouldn't call anyone we interacted with friendly.  I did get my hot tea on my 4th request.  The servers also all mumbled and looked at me impatiently...the food does come out pretty quickly though.

The AMBIANCE: I really like the vibe of the place.  It has a modern design, although it looks like the design elements were glued in place.  It gets just the right amount of volume when busy to make you feel like something is going on, but you don't have to shout.

OVERALL, I would have written this place a 4-star review.  With the food though, I'm subtracting a whole star for the exclusion of most of the sushi I actually wanted to order.  For a weekend night, that really reduces the value proposition unless you want to eat a whole lot of the other types of sushi.  I think next time I'll try the a la carte offerings."}
{"text":"Decent AYCE. We went for dinner & were promptly seated. Pretty big space. Service was good. Decor was nice, nothing too fancy or boring. 

We ordered a variety of food: assorted sushi (8/10), assorted hand/rolls: green dragon, volcano, dynamite, spicy salmon, out of control + more (8/10), chicken skewers (9/10), grilled salmon (10/10), CREAM CHEESE WONTONS ARE A MUST ORDER (10/10), calamari (9/10), tempura shrimp (9/10), deep fried scallop (5/10),  green tea ice cream (10/10), tiramisu (2/10), mango yogurt (5/10), mango ice cream (10/10). We must have ordered more, but that's all I can remember! 

Overall, this AYCE was pretty good & I would come here again!"}
{"text":"Probably one of the better AYCE sushi restaurants in downtown TO! I've been in search for a good AYCE sushi place forever( ever since Aji Sai's quality gone down). I finally got the chance to try out Fushimi and it was decent. Thankfully, it's only within a 5 min walk from where I live, makes it all the better (why is it all these good food places so close to me?!)

First, pro-tip : don't forget to make a reso! We did so and when we arrived we were able to bypass a long line (it was on a Saturday afternoon). Not only we felt like VIPs, we were also able to get seated at one of the nicest booths, far faaaar away from the entrance (it was a cold day)

In terms of the food, we loved the kitchen menu! Huge selection that includes chicken karaage, steak yakitori, various tempura options, Udons, scallop fried rice and black sesame pudding. For all you black sesame fans, don't miss trying out this delicious pudding with their red bean ice cream. Absolutely magical combination!

Now, the sushi. We weren't really big fans of the sushi. We tried their special 'out of control' roll and it was really strange. They had asparagus in it :S We also tried the red dragon roll and spicy salmon roll, and they were all really hard to eat. They were all really dry, unfortunately. 

I would certainly come back for the kitchen menu (and the black sesame pudding!) - they were certainly worth the price. Plus, with an awesome service, I will definitely be recommending this place to others."}
{"text":"This place went down the hill. Entrance, floors and walls are too dirty.

Quality of food used to be good. Now, you find bones in the fish all the time, oily, edamame is woody, etc

I used to eat here every other week. But I won't go back. Only thing good left is the beef, nicely done."}
{"text":"Excellent service and food. Highly recommended as I went to several different Japanese buffets, this is the place to try. I've been there weekends, weekdays, evenings before and the food and service quality is excellent."}
{"text":"As far as my experience with AYCE sushi restaurants downtown go, Fushimi is leading the pack. And it is found in such an unexpected location - the Church and Wellesley village. I live quite close to here and it is hardly a culinary destination. There are only a few businesses I would frequent regularly and their names are Fuel+ and Fushimi. Okay okay, let me just add Lola's Kitchen and Smith to that list. But on this immediately block the majority of other restaurants are highly underwhelming and overrated (or they are just chains or gay bars).

The main differentiators of Fushimi over the other AYCE places I've visited are as follows:
- it is not a chain
- the restaurant is cleaner, nicer and large than most with spaces for two and moderate/large parties
- decent alcohol selection incld. wine by the glass
- prompt service and a huge, varied and flexible menu
- lots of veggie options including salad, inari, avocado rolls, tempura etc
- the global signature rolls (read: fancier rolls). I love the veggie blast one
- the washrooms won't give you nightmares

The real hero of this restaurant is the gentleman who runs the front of house. He takes payments, seats customers, manages the cue and expectations, takes phone orders and is constantly talking to the chefs and running back into the restaurant to complete other tasks. I'm not sure if he is the owner or the manager - but whoever he is, he is highly competent.

Fushimi is not attached to any delivery or food ordering services such as UberEats, Foodora, JustEat, Ritual or Maegan. However, they do take telephone orders that can be ready in as little as 15 minutes. This place is always pretty, full even during the week, and also takes a lot of takeout orders. Be careful not to miss its tiny entrance next to the fruit market if you're hangry and in the mood for AYCE."}
{"text":"Awesome AYCE sushi, 5 stars!!

The thing that impressed me the most is their presentation of the food, because rarely do you see an AYCE establishment making much effort to make the food look appetizing. I've been to too many sushi buffets where they simply put the food onto a plate and just serve it to you. My group couldn't stop taking pictures of everything they serve to us. Some of my friends thought we went to a high-end establishment when they saw my pictures on FB lol.

The price is pretty cheap for an AYCE sushi restaurant in downtown, only $22.99 per person for weekday dinner, especially for the quality of food. The location is very convenient to get to as well, less than 5 minutes walk from Wellesley station. The store front looks small but when you get inside the space is actually larger than it seemed. 

The first two pages of their specials and chef recommendations are worth trying. I liked the salmon/tuna tartar (looks great in photos), walnut shrimp, pepper salmon, truffle white tuna, and shrimp skewer. Their sashimi were very good too, and they were served over ice, another nice touch that you don't see at other AYCE places. You get a thick cut of the piece of fish and for the fish eggs they serve them on a piece a cucumber, which made the taste come out more.

I had a great time with my friends at Fushimi: the food was great, the presentation was beautiful, the noise level was decent, and the price was inexpensive for a night out."}
{"text":"I went to Fushimi for the second time last week and I am definitely a fan! The first time I dined at Fushimi was over a year now and honestly I didn't think there was anything special about this place. For some reason the second time around I had a completely different opinion. The sashimi was fresh and the menu had a wide range of items from appetizers, to noodles, to rice and of course their specialty rolls. We tried the Fushimi, Sex on the beach, and Lava roll. I liked the mango sauce that was served on top of the Lava roll. It was refreshing and delicious. Fushimi also has monthly/ seasonal specials that they offer on their menu. We tried the live oysters (limit 2 per customer). They also included 2 specialty rolls in their seasonal special but I didn't really enjoy it. 

The place is spacious and clean. The servers were very attentive and quick. We did not wait very long before our food was served. I think during our time there the server only missed one of our items which I think is pretty good. I really don't know whether some servers purposely omits a few items from your order because they think you will not be able to finish it or they genuinely really missed it... This has always been a mystery to me... We ended our meal with a variety of different ice cream, pudding and my favorite Mango tapioca! 

I would say that the price point is also comparable to other AYCE sushi places. This is definitely one of my top favorites now. Definitely going back to see what other seasonal specials will appear on the menu. What a great way to keep the menu fresh and exciting!"}
{"text":"Such a nice experience! Great customer service, great quality, and great atmosphere. Would definitely recommend for any age group!"}
{"text":"The pros:
-Good price for AYCE
-The service was fast (around 1pm on a Thursday)
-The rolls are small (4 pieces), which allowed me to try more options
-They have good green tea ice cream

The cons:
-Everything was sticky. Literally. The floors, the table, the menu, and even the wall
-The menu doesn't explain what most of the rolls are
-The seafood ramen is all imitation seafood.  This makes sense given the price, but I found it inedible 
-The shrimp tempura was soggy
-The restaurant has very little character, especially given its location"}
{"text":"Arrived really early at 5:30pm on a Wed evening. We were one of the first ones there so once we ordered the food it came flying out blazing fast. I like how you place the orders here. On the menu each item has a code and on a small sheet of paper you just write down the code # and the quantity. The waitress then simply enters these codes and quantities into the computer and the food is made and sent out through the kitchen. 

Things to point out:
skewers were all seasoned with this spicy flavour that I really dislike which is commonly found in Mandarin style BBQ joints. Its hard to describe the flavour but once you try it you will know what I mean. Its definitely an acquired taste. I have more of a sweet tooth so I prefer sweet flavoured type seasoning like in Korean BBQ. Also all skewers were super salty and most of the meat was tough and difficult to chew. 

The quantity you order is the quantity you get. So if you order 20 pieces of salmon sashimi that's exactly how much you are going to get. Trust me, I Counted every single last piece. I found the slices very small and thin. All sashimi were served on a pile of ice which kept them nice and cool. For the most part the sashimi was fresh and delicious. 

Sashimi shrimp was terrible because it wasn't really sashimi shrimp since it was boiled which made them rubbery. I feed my pet turtle better shrimp than this.

I like how they have BBQ eel sashimi. I'm addicted to eel. I also like how they had frog legs....mmmm taste like chicken...but once again it had that spicy seasoning which I don't like. 

One of my favourite parts of AYCE is the desserts. We ordered a table full of ice creams and puddings between the four of us and we felt no shame in doing so :)

Mon - Thurs Dinner AYCE $21.99 for adults
Fri - Sun AYCE Dinner $24.99 for adults"}
{"text":"I've gone here for the all you can eat. The selection is great, with the staple buffet options and then some. 
It is very spacious, lots of room for large groups. 
For dessert try the black sesame ice cream, mango pudding, and mango yogurt.
I love how they display each plate like a piece of edible art - very carefully placed and for some dishes they even have a colourful light that just adds some fun touches to the meal. 
Definitely would recommend going if you are craving a mass amount of sushi/Japanese food that is good quality and a fair price."}
{"text":"This place has very fresh sushi and tasty creative rolls. We went for lunch on a weekend. I enjoyed everything we ordered, especially the spicy salmon roll and the Out of Control Roll. It is definitely the best AYCE sushi in the area. I also really enjoyed their icecream-much better quality than the standard AYCE icecream. I especially liked the mango and red bean (not the same red bean as you get at most places-very pink!)

The only complaints I have are that the rolls are larger than average for AYCE, and I prefer a little smaller so you can try more things. Also, I would like it more if it had seaweed salad on the lunch menu."}
{"text":"Great place awesome menu and very good sushi!!!! I would advise that you order as much as you want right when you sit down because it takes a while for the food to come. My favourite was the out of control sushi roll, chicken wings and crab salad!!!!  Easily One of the best all you can eat sushi places in the downtown core."}
{"text":"Good prices, good food. Shrimp tempura here is bomb! Definitely coming back here a lot more!!"}
{"text":"Food variety was good, and quality was alright, though not up to par with price. Service was bare minimum. Didn't check up, nor looked content. Staffs were just talking to each other. Atmosphere was just alright. More of a Chinese style layout and design. Conclusion: only food selection was nice, but the food itself was just alright."}
{"text":"They seem to have followed the trend of using iPads to order which I always appreciate because the paper system seems to always get mixed up during a busy evening.

Staff: They seemed a bit disorganized. We were a large party of 13 and typically in these situations you'd get two iPads (which we did after asking for the second one) and half the party orders on one and the others orders on two. The problem is, half the servers just plop down the food on a side without announcing what it is and then we're left to fend for ourselves. The silver lining is, the other half of the servers knew exactly which side to put it on and mentioned what it was each time so kudos to them.

Ambience: It's a long set up so the better seating is in the back. However, the front had some seating too. It was loud, but not too loud so I could still hear people in my party talk. There is a lack of space on the table and so we ran out of room really fast on the table.

Food: For the most part I liked it. They had great noodles, the rolls were well presented but fell apart on the occasion, and the tempura was fried nicely. For an AYCE, it's definitely a great option in terms of quality. Please note: they love to stack multiple orders into the same plate so it adds to the confusion of who ordered what and how much.

Great food, but awkward service when it comes to a large party. I'd say it's worth coming back."}
{"text":"As far as all you can eat sushi joints go this place is top notch.    Great service and good mixed clientele.     Cannot go wrong."}
{"text":"Price is good, but the food depends. I came here before and it was better than today. My friends told me that it really depends on the day.
Service is terrible, slow, not kind at all, they barely speak with you. Order one kind of sushi and didn't like the sauce, when the server came I asked her to take it because I didn't like and her answer was \"but you need to try\" and made a bad face. I repeated that I didn't like, she grabbed the plate rudely and left speaking in her language."}
{"text":"I posted the pictures of the menu because they have some unique, delicious AYCE options that you don't see at other AYCE sushi places. 

This place received five stars because the quality of the food, presentation and the various unique food options makes this place a must try. 

I loved salmon tartare, seafood salad and the coconut shrimp along with the sashimis. 

My only recommendation for the business would be to use smaller bowls and plates as it makes very difficult to eat when you are at a two person table."}
{"text":"A friend and I were exploring The Village when suddenly the sign for an AYCE Sushi restaurant catches my eyes!
I am a lover of Japanese food and I have been to at least 5 other AYCE Japanese restaurants, and I must say this one is the best (and the only one I plan returning to)!

Food: Awesome! For an AYCE, I think the food is pretty good. What I particularly like is that they don't skimp on the fillings, that is the filling-to-rice ratio is acceptable. I know that other AYCE Japanese restaurants like to skimp on the fillings and most of it is just rice. At Fushimi this is not the case. And THIS is why I actually like the sushi rolls (or cones) here; try them if you haven't before. ALSO, the noodle dishes here are actually GOOD (not AMAZING, but good)?! At all the other AYCE Japanese restaurants they always lacked flavour and were just plain bland, but here that was not the case.

Service: I didn't really expect the service to be great anyways, I mean it is an AYCE after all. I think the wait time was reasonable, and I liked that they actually got our orders right?! At all the other AYCE Japanese restaurants I have tried, they usually manage to mess up at least one order (probably because there's so much food being ordered?).

There's so many restaurants in the city that I don't want to make repeat visits to any, but Fushimi is definitely a staple for me, and my go-to place for when I'm getting the sushi cravings!"}
{"text":"I went there day before yesterday, and it was my second time. Same as my first time, the service was so bad. When they put foods, they didn't say anything and they forgot our orders again and again. No smile, no hospitality. Foods are fine, but they made me so uncomfortable."}
{"text":"This is really a great place for a casual big crowd dining. You get to have your own cooking performance and the most important of all everyone gets to choose their own food and enjoy it together.  The only down side is not much service.  You need to catch the waiter or waitress like trying to catch a butterfly and also hope that they will remember to fulfill you order the first time wtihout reminding them.  Anyhow, for the price and the food quality, they deserve a 4 stars."}
{"text":"Not a fan of this sushi restaurant. The sushi tastes like ewww but the sashimi is good tho. And the udon noodles are not good"}
{"text":"Some of their items were Great, other not so good. For instance my friends and i were raving for their sushi, sashimi and walnut shrimps. However their seaweed salad was a messy gunk that tasted too sweet. A bit disappointing for a Japanese restaurant.

Having iPads to order made everything go seamlessly and the staff was pleasant.

Somewhere to go for a casual fair only."}
{"text":"Really good quality All u can eat sushi place. They have a lot of selections to choose from. All the dishes are well decorated as well. The food come in small portion so that u can try out more dishes!!! 
Highly recommend the Volcano Roll!!!!
Weekend dinner for $25.99 

Only one thing to improve is the service from the waitress."}
{"text":"This is my go to sushi place, and it just happens to be around the corner from my house...can you say amazing!  My friend and I end up here I would say once a week to fulfill our sushi cravings.

I've checked in about 10 times, but have been here way more.  I hate to say it, but sometimes Yelp is not on my mind.

At first Fushimi was only AYCE, but they have no implemented an a la carte menu option as well.  I never eat just a small amount of sushi, so AYCE is the only way to go for me.  The food is a great price ($21 for dinner), the service is fast (especially if you're a regular like me...they pretty much know what we want to order before we sit down), they offer rolls I've never heard of, and the quality is very good.  The rice and noodle dishes are yummy and the miso soup is some of the best I've had.

There are a few down falls to this place, one being that the pop is not bottomless.  Second, the bathroom is very small and unisex, so don't be surprised if you see a member of the opposite sex washing their hands next to you. Third, they need to redo the seats as the material is cracking and it brings the place down. Finally, the grilled meats can be a bit tiny and not consistent in quality.

Over all = I give this place two chopstick up!"}
{"text":"Sushi was super fresh, the owners are very nice as well. Definitely one of the best AYCE sushis in town !"}
{"text":"I used to have nothing bad to say about Fushimi....but lately it's just gotten worse and worse. This used to be my favorite AYCE restaurant because the quality exceeded all the other sushi AYCE places downtown.The quality of food isn't there anymore and they removed some really good items from the menu. This is probably the last time I eat here."}
{"text":"Oh man, the emoji with the heart eyes perfectly describes my reaction to Fushimi.
It is a bit expensive  ($28 for ayce dinner on a weekday), but it was so good.
Think seared. Think sauces.
Everything they set down was amazing.
The salmon was delicious. I enjoyed every type of sushi we ordered. I can't give examples. I can't remember.  Just know, whatever you order, they won't steer you wrong. 
Even the grilled food was on fleek.

No wonder this place was packed! 
Definitely the best AYCE sushi I've had in Toronto thus far."}
{"text":"Overall experience: 3.75/5
 I went with a friend for dinner, to try this place that had good reviews. I've got to say, it was quite impressive with the variety on the menu, and ordering on a tablet. This place has lots of seating with a great clean atmosphere. The customer service could be better.. as they barely make eye contact and communicate with you. They pretty much drop your food off at the corner of the table. Anyhow.. I did enjoy mainly the sashimi, which is important.. as you want your moneys worth ( if you're into raw food).

AYCE dinner: $25.99

Salads:
I had the seaweed salad and I enjoyed it, My friend had the avocado salad but didnt like the dressing. 3/5

Apetitzers:
We got shrimp and zucchini tempura, which was quite tasteful! 4/5

Sashimi:
Small portions, but its AYCE so cant complain. It tasted really fresh, especially because they serve it in a bowl with ice! We had salmon, white tuna , mackerel, and surf clam. Sashimi quality is 5/5

Sushi: 
-bbq eel and mackerel : I was very satisfied so 5/5
-salmon rose: my friend really enjoyed this and ordered a few. 5/5

Rolls/handrolls:
- Spicy salmon hand roll: spiciness is on point. I find that most sushi places call their rolls spicy, but doesnt have that kick! The only thing is, they use a bit much of the tempura bits... So I just removed as much as I could. Other than that.. 4/5
- salmon special roll: again, I love the quality of their sashimi but this also had tempura bits on top, didnt look so appealing but was tasty! 3.5/5


Dessert: 
- Mango pudding... not a fan of this, was almost flavorless 2.5/5
- Red bean ice cream, not the best I've tasted. Tasted like strawberry milk bubbletea with some beans. 3/5
- Green tea icecream, pretty standard taste.. So I enjoyed it! 5/5"}
{"text":"This is a pretty good all-you-can-eat sushi place in the middle of Church and Wellesley. I've been here a couple times and the food has always been good. The iPad menu is easy to use, and the servers are always prompt when you ask for them to come to your table. The dinner price is a little more expensive than I'd like, but there aren't many AYCE places in the area so it's worth it. The interior is nice, nothing too spectacular, but there's a lot of seating so you probably wouldn't have to wait. I'll definitely continue coming here so long as they keep their AYCE menu."}
{"text":"This place has lost its bearing in the village. I come here all the time and this Friday evening was the worst. I came in to get my name on the rsvp paper and wasted an hr and half waiting.. STILL WAITING..  management needs to actually do something about the shitty service. You can't claim intially it's 15 mins with 4 tables ahead of you and then claim it's 30 mins with 6 tables ahead of you. Stop doing double RSVP lists and ACTUALLY let people go in and stop holding it for people who are late. It's an absolute waste of people's time and effort to actually respect a restaurant that doesn't give a shit. Big rant."}
{"text":"This place is our favorite. Absolutely everything is top notch. Great quality sushi,  tons of great appetizers,  service. We love it!"}
{"text":"Great AYCE place! Their presentation is always very pretty and never quite the same. Shows that they put some effort into serving the food instead of just putting what you ordered on a plate and sending it over. 

The servers are usually quite friendly and the food all tastes pretty great! I would give it a 5* except sometimes they forget some things in your order and they never come."}
{"text":"Great presentation on the sashimi! The hand rolls were perfect and full of eel and spicy tuna. Not rice. The service was quick and very friendly. All the other reviews of slow crappy service are false. 
Must try the salmon ceviche and the pepper salmon..though looks small it was a treat. 

The only thing that sucks is the location being in church st.... it's like being in rainbow bizzaro world."}
{"text":"My friend and I came here for lunch on a Friday, and had their AYCE lunch. Note that on Fridays the lunch is $1 more than Monday to Thursday ($13.99).  The food was okay. My favorite dish was the sushi pizza. I hated that almost every dish had onions. It was like the kitchen simply could not let a single dish go out withut garnishing each plate with green onions. Yes, I hate onions. Chives, okay, I can eat chives. Oh, and every portion is tiny. Which is a good thing, in case you hate the dish. If you like it, just get more!"}
{"text":"So I discovered this restaurant thanks to a friend. The food at first seemed good and hey ipads to order your food. Great! I thought, cut back on paper waste and messy handwriting. Well, the first time we went there my partner and I got cold miso soup and cold Edamame and service was slow. Well, yesterday was my birthday (09/20) I first went in and tried to get a table and was blatantly ignored by the server (named Iris) when we tried to get a different table as I wanted a table with a back to the wall due to my anxiety. We got our food at a very slow rate, a lot of the food was for sure a frozen product. The coconut shrimp was just a grocery store product drizzled in some cheap mustard-like sauce. my boyfriend got the beef ramen and it was totally bland. no seasoning, no salt nothing, after some soy sauce it had SOME taste. We also ordered a carafe of Sake, now I don't claim to know a lot about sake but I do know you shouldn't be able to essentially set fire to it by the fumes given off. as our final meal we got a \"dancing fire log\" it looked and sounded interesting... Yeah no. DO NOT GET IT. it looked like something my cat puked up. All in all the food isn't that good. a lot of the food is pre-made frozen, and all in all not that good. The servers are rude and the decor is outdated. not worth the time or money"}
{"text":"The food on the normal menu was good sushi. However I came here for a la carte with a big group of people and it was busy & was let down by service in every aspect. The waitress was rude, did not accommodate an allergy, which my friend then had to leave to buy benedryl. The service was incredibly slow, no drinks were taken, the orders were screwed up& it took up to 30 minutes for each tray of food to come out. They further messed up everyone's bills, screwing up my friends birthday. I'm sure this place would be good with 2-3 people. Unfortunately with such a bad experience I will not be returning here and I don't recommend big parties eat here ."}
{"text":"I usually do not have very high expectations of AYCE sushi places during lunch time, as I find the quality and service is just not quite there. Well, colour me surprised when we stopped in for lunch on a Saturday. The hand rolls were the first to be delivered and it was crunchy and fresh. The sushi presentation was on point for AYCE as well -- none of that sloppy crap on a plate with teriyaki sauce. The rolls are not filled with too much rice and none of it was loose. The lunch menu was pretty good as well, with a good selection of cooked appetizers. Other than the lack of sashimi (which I admit I don't truly enjoy anyway -- blasphemy, I know), it pretty has all your standard AYCE dishes and ice cream desserts. I would definitely be back to take advantage of the lunch prices and the fresh rolls."}
{"text":"Love the quality of the food this place offers. however, their service definitely needs an improvement. I've been here more than a handful and I've noticed that whenever it's lunch or dinner rush, their service goes out of the window. my friends and i went last night and we were a party of 6. we didn't get our sashimi order until one of us actually spoke to a waitor and asked them about it...and this was closer to the end. we waited because we honestly thought they were gonna bring our sashimi without us reminding them. the waitors were so rude, curt, and dismissive of our needs and requests. my friend had asked for a tea and a lady brought it over and instead of handing it to him, she literally slammed the cup on the end of the table. if possible, go here when it's not busy or else your experience would be the worst. if not, i'd recommend avoiding it in general"}
{"text":"Went a lot during when it first opened and the food was pretty amazing. Even added extra and tried the teppanaki option. 

Best plating for an AYCE place in my opinion.

Still pretty good but found a place with scallop sushi and sweet shrimp sashimi. Yum."}
{"text":"When you have killed prices, amazing staff, great selection, nice friendly ambience,and good food, I can't help but to give 5 stars.  
 
First night in Toronto we stop here for dinner and the place is packed! And stayed packed until closing, after a 15 minute wait we were seated and admittedly a little confused by the process. You have full access to the entire menu, specials and all minus drinks, and you are given a note pad where you put your order ( by number and how many servings). Each time they take this paper you are given a new one. 

To be an AYCE sushi place I wasn't expecting phenomenal quality but still the food was really good, didn't get any sashimi so can't comment on that freshness and quality but the food we did have was super tasty! 

My friend loved her salmon tartare, didn't try any because I don't like salmon. The crispy tuna was amazing! And the eel and avocado roll we had was great as well. Other rolls ( tuna hand roll, spicy crab, and some salmon thing) were really good nothing to brag but have nothing bad to say. The Karage and katsu were so crunchy and delicious. Mussels sooo good, and everything else ( ramen, shrimp yakitori, udon, and gyoza) were standard good dishes. The Red bean ice cream was great tasted like strawberry with beans and the black sesame pudding was good too. Black sesame ice cream I didn't care for not because it was a bad dessert it was was very very nutty lol not my thing.

The portion sizes is great as well because it kinda keeps you from over eating. With all the food and mango alcoholic drinks we spent around $30 US a piece so around $40 CAD. Pretty great in my opinion. Staff was nice including the manager who served us a few times and the crowd was varied and laid back."}
{"text":"About $25 after taxes for all you can eat dinner on a Monday. Tea is complimentary, good variety in the all you can eat menu, good food and it comes out fast too, and service is a lot better than most AYCE places. Only complaint is that they should ask how scopes of ice cream should be allotted instead of putting two scopes of green tea or red bean in the same bowl."}
{"text":"I love sushi. More, I love all you can eat sushi. A couple friends and I went here; I wasn't gonna get all you can eat but after my friends started discussion their plan of action, I couldn't resist. 

I'm not going to list all of the things I ate because, well, I don't want to bore you. We ordered a ton of food and it all came out pretty quickly. Generally the sushi was good. Not the best I've had, not the worst. If I was rating just the food, I'd give it about 3 stars. 

What brings us down to 2 is the service. We waited for a table for 3 for about 10 minutes when there were clearly several tables available. Maybe they were too busy and the kitchen couldn't keep up? Yeah, maybe, but they could have communicated that instead of just making us wait. Finally we were sat at a table closest to the kitchen, beside the area where the servers drop off their jackets and bags and things. There were other tables available, but for whatever reason, we were put here...felt like we were just being put out of the way. 

The service began by my friend asking if they had papaya juice. The server scrunched her face, said \"no,\" and walked away. Ok...we would have ordered a different juice, or anything for that matter, but we were left with our waters. Fine. This trend seemed to continue - every request we had was met with an eye roll, as though we were inconveniencing them. I would admit if we were being difficult, but I swear our only crime was ordering udon noodles which we didn't like, and leaving them there on the table when we went to pay. You're supposed to pay for dishes you dint finish but we weren't going to try to communicate that at this point. 

Too bad. Just a smile or some common courtesy could have turned the whole experience around."}
{"text":"I hate to leave bad reviews but this place was nasty. Service was great, I didn't have a drink but other people's drinks looked good. I did like that you just order from the iPad and the food comes in 10 minutes or so but that's about all I liked. The spicy tuna tasted like a weird chemical."}
{"text":"For AYCE downtown this place is legit.  We came at a good time too around 6:30, at around 7 it filled up. Reservations are recommended. Food was good, fresh and came out quick. Servers were quick to remove dishes and were friendly. Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Great selection and price for downtown ayce! Ive been here twice in a month now and had a great time. Easy to order with the iPads, for came quick. Loved the Walnut shrimp, all the tataki options, cerviche and specially rolls"}
{"text":"This place has gone super downhill and it makes me really sad because I used to love it! 

We made a reservation for a Friday night at 6:30 pm. When we arrived, there were people scattered everywhere in the doorway. It was super crowded and clearly busy (fair enough). That's fine, but it was such a hot mess. The hosts were all over the place and there was this weird pane of glass in the middle of the waiting area that was dangerously slanted and looked like it was going to fall over! The place has gotten seriously filthy. I didn't use the bathroom, but my husband said it was nasty. 

The food was OK. The rolls took forever. I think we waited over 20 minutes for our rolls to get there and then they weren't even that good. The rolls were falling apart. We also got a grilled shrimp dish, which we had before and was delicious, and the shrimp were so teeny and dinky. Not yummy. I wasn't very impressed with the food. The salmon had a bit of a funny taste. 

Overall the cleanliness and quality of Fushimi has gone downhill. It can't be a surprise when it's busy on a Friday night and they were clearly understaffed and unable to handle it."}
{"text":"This may be my new favorite AYCE sushi place and I don't even like AYCE that much.

The food is delicious and they offer an extensive menu. Tuna naruto is my favorite! Cucumber wrapped instead of rice. So good. The sashimi is served on a bed of ice so they don't get warm from sitting out. The sushi rolls were decently sized although a bit too much rice for my liking. 

Grilled foods were flavourful however don't expect great cuts of meat for all you can eat. Beef was a bit chewy. What really blew me away was presentation of the foods. Each dish came out nicely presented. You can tell they put effort in it and it looks nice but we quickly ran out of room on our table because the plates were so big. 

They serve black sesame ice cream which is a win in my books. Didn't bother to try the other stuff.

The washroom was also surprising as it's unisex so just be wary of that. Service was alright. They weren't that busy when I was there however and it still took a while for refills.

Overall, one of the better AYCE I've been to. Definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"We went at lunch but we ordered for dinner. The food was so good, lot of options and fresh. The environment is also good. For me their service is good. I asked them for vinegar and they gave me more than I ever gotten from others. My friend order teriyaki sauce as well. I will go back again and again. So the price with out tip is 29.37$."}
{"text":"My favorite AYCE spot ever! I've read other reviews having problems with service but for the amount of times I've gone there, I did not have any problems with the waiters. I like how they implemented ipads to order, they used paper and pencil before. Price is very decent, I love their walnut shrimp & seafood udon. Sashimi all the way!"}
{"text":"Slow service, order the hot food first then sushi if you are doing AYCE. The sushi was meh, not much to say didn't wow away"}
{"text":"I'm very ambivalent about this place. The service was very slow, but the quality of sushi was good. The washrooms are unisex and the doors did not lock!!! Very mediocre AYCE place."}
{"text":"This is by far the best sushi ayce I've had so far in downtown Toronto. I like how they serve their sashimi on ice.  I know it's suppose to be room temp but I like it kind of cold. Their menu is big and their food isn't bad at all for ayce standards."}
{"text":"This is the to go place if you're ready to have an all you can eat sushi experience around the Church Wellesley area! The rolls are fresh and tempura is crispy. They also have iPad menus so it makes it super simple to order.

Some of my favourites:
-eel sushi
-tempura
-agedashi tofu
-sashimi
-california cone"}
{"text":"$26 for weekend dinner. The inside was kinda sketchy, they had a big tv monitor with what seemed like a video of fishes on playback. The service was average. Food was mediocre. I was hoping for a nicer atmosphere and food but it didn't reach expectations - very loud inside too. We came here with a group of 6 and I could hardly hear others. I likely won't be coming back but trying another ayce sushi."}
{"text":"Horribly atrocious service!  Avoid it at all cost!

Have you been to an AYCE restaurant and LESS than half of your order came out?

have you been to an AYCE restaurant where the attendant refuses to deliver your order because according to her I ordered too much? (There were three of us and each only ordered three items... We actually ordered LESS than our regular non-AYCE order)

Have you been a restaurant that when you complain about the above lack of service the manager actually defended the staff?"}
{"text":"I have been here many times and you can't beat the all you can eat for $28! It's located just down the street from me (dangerous!) and it's a nicely laid out restaurant, clean, great food and has fast and friendly service. I even brought my parents here when they were visiting from Australia and they loved it! 

Highly recommended :)"}
{"text":"I have no idea that Fushimi is an AYCE restaurant. There are no menu or any signage that indicate that it is, all I saw \"Authentic Japanese and that sucked me in.

From their website: \"FUSHIMI, derived from the French and Japanese language, truly reflects upon the delectable cuisine of our restaurant. 

As the Executive Chef of Manhattan's finest International 5-Star hotel, head chef MICHAEL LEE have created unique dining experiences for guests and visitors for over 20 years. Now he is bringing this 5-star French and Japanese fusion experience to Toronto. With dedication, creativity and passion, FUSHIMI promises to take Japanese fusion to the another level.\"

Frankly, as an AYCE Japanese place, Fushimi is quite decent. I don't see any \"Fusion\" nor \"French\" influence at all in the dishes I tried. And as usual people going to AYCE is just trying to eat as much as possible and be stuffed?! I really doubt they expect a \"5 star\" experience with a $12.99 Lunch??

- Steamed shrimp Meat Dumplings
- Avocado Salad with Sesame Dressing
- Hibachi 4 oz steak (done perfectly medium rare but just drowned in sauce)
- Salmon Sushi
- Unagi Maki
- Spicy Scallop Maki
- Shrimp Tempura (shrimps were fresh and were not mushy)
- Sesame Ice Cream

All done quite well. I was quite surprise to find that all the rolls and sushi were not over stuffed with rice....

Services were lacking.. though the staffs are nice and friendly but lack the training.

I was seated with no one asked me what to drink or if I ready to order till I waved one down. I was without tea until after my first order arrived and I asked the waitress again to get me some tea.

It also took me awhile to get my bill, even the restaurant was empty at 3:00 pm.

Fushimi is just another Chinese ran Japanese AYCE.... if you don't have any \"5 star\" expectation you will be ok. And I don't find anything fusion or French with all the items I ordered, maybe I am missing something?"}
{"text":"One of the better, if not the best AYCE sushi restaurants downtown. The sashimi is served on a bed of ice and they have such a huge selection with specials. The walnut shrimp, ribs, and chicken wings are delicious, non-sushi choices. The rice to fish ratio for the rolls is good too. Desserts here are top notch. Served in small shot glasses, don't be afraid to order 20+ of each.

The service is not the best though, I always have to ask multiple times for water, ginger, any extra sauces. Also, if you order a ton of sashimi, even with a big group of people, don't expect them to live up to your amounts. It's okay though, just keep ordering more."}
{"text":"I came here twice on a weekday for lunch with a friend and I'm surprised that an ayce sushi place had such a  good quality a la carte lunch menu. Did I mention it's a great deal? 

$10 - teriyaki calamari with vegetables, 3 thick pieces of sashimi, 2 pieces of beef gyoza, salad, soup, rice and ice cream. 

$7 - 2 rows (your choice) + soup, salad - I got the spicy salmon and spicy tuna. But you can also choose eel, dynamite, Alaska to name a few.

Don't forget to remind them to scoop you the ice cream at the end if your meal comes with it. I forgot once and I didn't get my ice cream. Service is really basic. Unless you flag them down, they aren't going to attend, which is fine when I just want to catch up with a friend without much interruption."}
{"text":"Made reservations for dinner thinking it was A Taste of Japan restaurant. The person who took the reservations said that they renovated and changed the name, but didn't mention that they are now a AYCE restaurant.

Arriving at the restaurant, other than the new name and sign, everything looks similar to A Taste of Japan, but with a fresh coat of paint and some very minor changes to the decor. It looks like the mild renovations actually cheapened the atmosphere of the restaurant.

They do have an á la carte menu but you will have to ask for it. But since it is an AYCE restaurant, the AYCE menu looks impressive, and the price is reasonable, we decided to do AYCE. The only downside was some of the sushi items were additional $1 per order and the Hibachi items were $3 extra per order.

The food was decent, though most of the fried items were too oily. I didn't care for the flashing coloured lights that was served with the sashimi which I thought was too gimicky and tacky. 
I found it odd that no wasabi or pickled ginger were served with the sushi/sashimi, you will need to ask for it.
Service was fast and courteous, though at times they didn't seem that well organized or was confused -- probably because they were so new.

When the bill arrived we were pleasantly surprised to receive a 10% grand opening discount.
All-in-all I thought it was one of the better AYCE restaurants, but as a Japanese/sushi restaurant it was rather mediocre. The restaurant change is a step down to what it was before, but I am guessing it will improve over time."}
{"text":"Yet another, what I like to call, chinese/korean fusion sushi place, I'm a bit judgemental of these places since, they are touting authenticity and \"real japanese food\", creating an impression on North American minds, that THIS is Japanese, when it most certainly is not. However, this one is rather a more expensive one! They used to have a grand opening price, and I think that that price was much more reasonable for the quality of food we are getting. 

The food is plated on overly pretentious plates that take up a quarter of your table for just one item, so unlike most all you can eats, I would advise you to use caution and order a few things at a time, unless they are the same thing, ex mixed sashimi will come on one huge plate but each tuna tar tar, noodles etc will each have a dinner plate. The tempura is overly battered and rendered into skinny little grease sticks with enough oil on them that one could use it to weather proof their shirt and I swear there is a slight livery taste in the beef teri-yucky.  None of the cooked items taste anything like they should, things are not marinated or seasoned enough or correctly for what they are calling it, everything is just slathered with the usual sauce. The tartar is okay, but comes with a huge portion of rice under it, and is essentially the inside of a spicy tuna/salmon roll plopped atop a disc of rice. My biggest pet peeve is the deep fried takoyaki, octopus balls... They are most certainly frozen product, and not only that but the name Tako \"yaki\" has reference to the cooking process which is not deep frying until they've turned into hard little spheres of oiliness. If you want the same balls, Korea town's PAT grocery has them.  What I do credit them for is that their sashimi are not gargantuan sized hunks of fish flesh that are too overwhelming to enjoy even a bit like some of the other restaurants that use precut fish.

The service is I guess, pretty excellent, compared to most other \"authentic\" japanese places.  If you want a real taste of japanese food, try the actual japanese places like Hiro and Kaji, and watch Jiro. In comparison this place is like paying for a steak and getting cup noodles."}
{"text":"Came here because Hibachi was included with the dinner, so why not?

Anyways, the atmosphere looked a bit... off. Maybe it was the colour of the walls or the lighting (which wasn't quite a lot even when it was pitch black), or how empty it initially was (though eating at 6pm doesn't help), I don't know.

Beyond that, the food was alright, the sashimi/ stuff from the kitchen is what you would expect for a decent AYCE place, the waitresses were helpful, and the chef we got for the Hibachi turned out to be quite experienced, so that left a rather good impression.

All in all, not bad for a newly opened AYCE, though the additional charges for certain things does seem weird."}
{"text":"This is in my neighbourhood and it's an easy go to. It's located in a building that was custom designed for the Italian chain ill Fornello, and when the lease was taken over by the current owners they absolutely trashed the award winning design. The front wall used to be moveable to allow for an outdoor court yard, and the interior paint lighting and decor was spectacular. It's both trashy and tacky now, but then again I wasn't there for the design I was there for the food.

The food was OK and very well priced, despite the fact they've now gone to iPad menus which were so frustrating to navigate we eventually had to find a waiter-and that's not easy.  Service sucked.

But here's the one star clincher, wow, is this place dirty! 

The floors don't look like they've been washed in months, food splashes down the wall, crap crusted it in the corners... And if the public areas look like this you can only imagine how dirty the kitchen is.

On my way out I pointed it out to that maître d' who shrugged and completely dismissed me.

We really noticed the lack cleanliness on our exit - and you can be rested assured that will be our last time walking out of there, much less into there."}
{"text":"I had beet waiting to come to this place. Unfortunately it was lacklustre.  If you want a real treat go to Inaka in Caledon. It's heaven"}
{"text":"We do a lot of sushi ayce and this is so far the bessst quality and bang for the buck. Service isn't as bad as others but still no where near great."}
{"text":"One of the better sushi places. Their out of control roll is very good. Cheese wonton is superb. Will definitely come again.

AYCE prices can be seen in picture."}
{"text":"I loooove Fushimi! AYCE (dinner) is worth it no matter what meal it is. I really like the walnut shrimp; which isn't part of the lunch menu among other things, and many of their rolls. I'm docking a star for it not always being consistent with food (quality and quantity) and service isn't always great but its not like you're there for anything but food when you go for AYCE."}
{"text":"I liked how this place has ipads so the customers could order comfortably, and I loved the food as well. However the service was terrible."}
{"text":"One of the best AYCE sushi restaurants in Toronto, located in the heart of the Gay Village.  Cool, modern atmosphere with comfortable seating.  A bit noisy, but the turnover on the tables was quick.

Really fresh sushi, service was very quick and the menu was varied, very interesting.  Washrooms were really gross for such a nice place, which was the only drawback to an otherwise really enjoyable/satisfying experience."}
{"text":"Definitely one of the better AYCE sushi places I have been to. The decor here is a lot nicer than most I have experienced. 

The food tasted fresh, the dishes were bigger than most other sushi places I have been to. Also, the food we ordered here ACTUALLY came to the table, unlike most sushi places where half the order never makes the table. 

We came on a Sunday night and had to wait 30-40 mins for a table for 4. The place is definitely well known. 

My only complaint was random slow service throughout the meal. Other than that. No complaints

I would return for sure if I was in the area again."}
{"text":"I went two times both on weekend for dinner. They were fully packed both times.  I did not try the teppanyaki.

Food Selection/Quality: Variety of food is above average. Sushi/sashimi is below average. Hot food was average. 

Service: Average service. The food came promptly. They did screw up orders a few times but I find that a lot of AYCE restaurants make the same mistakes so try to be patient.

Price: Average in comparison with the competition

Atmosphere: When it is packed, it can get quite loud but that is to be expected. I felt a bit cramped sitting in my seat.

There is nothing outstanding about Fushimi but the food wasn't so terrible that I wouldn't go back again."}
{"text":"All I have to say is WOWWWWW!!!!

I tried this place last night with a friend who lives nearby. He had really wanted to try it and we were both pretty hungry. We checked out some photos of the food on Yelp before heading over. We couldn't believe some of the things we saw! 

Usually all you can eat sushi is the same old standard stuff and quality and presentation isn't always the best.

Fushimi really blew us out of the park. The first couple pages of the menu were chef's selection and specialty things. Usually I'm a picky eater but I surprisingly was down for a whole bunch of them so we started off with those! SO GOOD!!

They had an awesome roll wrapped in cucumber, tuna tartar, walnut shrimp and truffle tuna. All unreal!

Some of my other favorite things on the menu were the spicy crab salad and the spicy tuna hand roll which was filled to the brim with a ton of fish. I kept ordering those things over and over!!

The staff were really friendly but one star off for them taking long to take our next order at times but hey maybe they didn't think we were ordering more considering how much we had ordered in the first place!

I'll be back :)"}
{"text":"Best ayce sushi I've found downtown so far! My friend and I went on a random Sunday for the ayce dinner ($26.99) and we had to wait about 15 minutes as we didn't have a reservation. After being seated we ordered a few rolls, shrimp tempura and cheese wontons. The rolls came out so quickly, maybw 5 minutes tops! Which was great because we were starving.  Service has always been good an consistent. There has never been a visit where I had an issue. Everything from the kitchen (fried apps, etc.) were always piping hot. Maki, nigiri, and sashimi always fresh and tasty. Highly recommended if you are in the area looking for yummy ayce sushi!"}
