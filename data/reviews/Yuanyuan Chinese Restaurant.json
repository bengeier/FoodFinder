{"text":"I can totally see why this place has a low review. Yes it's dirty and pretty run down looking, but it's also very authentic to northern chinese cuisine and serves alot of strange chinese things that other restaurants do not.  I came here with my mom around 3pm on Saturday and it was half full on an off hour.  We had this dish that was basically fried dough wrapped in a crepe with chives and preserved tofu inside- sounds gross? it was yummy.  We also had dumplings that were delicious and homemade.  This place was so cheap I couldn't even believe it.  3 of us ate for $14. whoop whoop."}
{"text":"Pretty good Northern cuisine at your average cheap Scarborough pricing, but the hygiene is highly questionable."}
{"text":"My go to place when craving northern Chinese food, great prices( $1 appetizers) and tons of options when it comes to steamed buns and homemade dumplings. *Dill is my favourite! 

If you can look past the lack of interior design, and just want a cheap wholesome meal this is the place for you! 

Order: 
Spicy Potato Shreds 
Tofu Brains (sounds gross, but it's very good) 
Dill and pork steamed buns 
Any type of dumplings 
egg and fried dough pancake 
Any type of deep fried pork/ sweat and sour pork"}
{"text":"This place is a bit rundown. The price is cheap and the food is decent. I came here with a friend around 230-3pm so there weren't many people. So I can't really judge them for their service because we were able to get their attention.

Many other restaurants serve this kind of food so I wouldn't rush back here because its not the most comfortable place to eat at."}
{"text":"Hygiene and quality of the food is very questionable. Presentation of the food is also terrible. We ordered three dishes and barely touched them. Made a few suggestions to the waitress and she just shrugged it off. Left with an empty stomach and 25$ wasted. Never coming back again."}
{"text":"Yuan Yuan Chinese Restaurant is a Northern Chinese restaurant. 

Deco here is minimum. Almost all the waitress and patrons here are Mandarin Speaking... I have to say it must be quite authentic! 

Lunch Special at Yuan Yuan seems like a good deal at $5.50 includes taxes and the portions are huge! But it is the Worst tasting Beef Noodles I ever ate! 

- Soup is warm... and taste bland... like colour brownish water 
- Noodle are not cooked properly.. oh so flour tasting and chewy and bland... just hate it! And so plentiful too. 
- Beef tasted so dry and tough. And not much of a taste and they are like cold.. just hate it! And so plentiful too! 
- Veggie is the only thing I like in the beef noodle! And hardly have any! 

I just could not finish even quarter of that! Just feel like throwing up when eating it... hey this is REAL bad! 

BTW, the waitress here was not too nice, frown on me when I ask for the Lunch menu... 

The other dishes might taste better, just don't order any noodle soup! But I don't know if I going to be back to check those out!

Cash Only!"}
