{"text":"I am now regular at Brar's, especially at their Great Lakes location. Since last 3 times, Kumiss Kubreja is taking care of us. She is great and always ensures my mother is doing good with her food selection. Employees like her really add value to overall customer experience. Thanks Kumiss for the best service you have been providing us, and I am sure many more customers say the same thing. 

Another great experience at Brar's. Food and crew both are very good. Feels like eating at home. 
This time Naira took care of our order, recommended stuff and all went wonderful. Service = Excellent 
Food = Excellent 
Price = Economic 
Overall = Great value
Thanks Naira for the great service. Will be visiting again soon"}
{"text":"Horrible place do not go! Wish I could give it a one star. Food took forever to come and when we finally got the water we were sh op Ked to find a spider in it horrible place do not go"}
{"text":"This has been by far the worst restaurant experience I've ever had. The portions were extremely small and the food not even cooked properly. The side dishes of rice were still hard and not edible, the few rotten pieces of veggies in a tiny bowl (which they call salad) was disgusting. I requested to speak with the manager to give him my feedback. He was extremely rude and snobby and refused to even listen to was I was telling him. The service was very slow considering there were only two other tables being served at the time. The waiter was friendly and the atmosphere was nice but that's the only positive thing I can say about this place. Would not recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Uh uh.!
Definitely a place where you take your gora friends to impress them...... but wait for it..... you will fail... 
This isnt your daily ...go grab the snacks place... not going to be good on your pocket...1bread pakora is bloody$4 where everybody else is giving it for$1.50 easy...and they are dry on the outside like so thick after eating half of it you be like ..this aint worth it
only good snacks you can enjoy are paneer pakora...
Sweets are good.
My only problem is money hungry mofos... who  place the old samosa in a fancy basket and think they can charge more.... every snack of theirs has a thick layer... so you done enjoying anything..... 
most indian places you can revisit...shit not this one... nothing i had ...i enjoyed.... bread pakora...chilli pakora...gobi pakora(dont even try) ... dhokla was alright.... paneer pakora.... like i said wanted to buy samosa.. but they were sitting in a basket lit under a lamp...shit looked like old bazaari samosa... 
cant suggest them shit...they look fancy as f... so they have to take it out of customer's pocket..."}
{"text":"Service is very slow and way more price than any other restaurant. You have to wait forever to get ur order finally arrived."}
{"text":"Poor service and very expensive. Be prepared to wait for a long time if you are dining in. Food was ok."}
{"text":"We were a group of 11. Service was poor and extremely slow. Had the dahi puri, saag, daal, shahi paneer, and naan. Food was lackluster. Most probably wont come again or reccomend."}
{"text":"All I can say is I have a new favourite spot to go to the classic Indian comfort food of chole bhatura.  My god, when the lady came out with the plate of food the smell hit me first.  It smelled sweet and kind and just screamed at me to poke at the balloon like bread! I did. And then I didn't have time to take a picture.  It was delicious and tasted pure like they were fried in especially clean oil. The chole was the standard but had a little sweet savoury taste that other places nod not have.  They lose a star because the price is much higher than other places."}
{"text":"Have visited this location twice now, both times with my fiance's family who hail from Punjab, India so I feel they are the experts in this cuisine in my opinion (and they love this place!).

To share we started with the platter (had fried chili, bread pakora, paneer pakora, fried gobi and pakora) and a tikki chat. Both dishes were delicious. The fried platter items were nicely spiced and not greasy. The tikki chaat is basically a fried potato patty covered in savoury yogurt along with spices and chutneys - the hot and cold combination is like heaven in your mouth, so good.

For our mains, we ordered a dosa, channa bhatura, shahi paneer, malai kofta, and some naan breads. All of the subjees tasted delicious but my favourite was the malai kofta. Well spiced, super flavourful and their naan breads were light as air.

We ended the meal with Indian cappucinos, and shared plate of galab jamun with kulfi (think cake and ice cream) and milk cake (similar to fudge perhaps). 

Overall, we enjoyed our meal. Food was fresh, tasty, and seems to be prepared with care. Service was a bit lacking but that's not a huge draw for me in this scenario, it's the food.

Note to my carnivorous friends : food here is vegetarian but I promise you won't miss the meat, just try it! I am sure we will be back for a visit again soon!"}
{"text":"I love Indian food!!! I was craving for Chai this morning so I literally waited for it to open at 11am today. I got three combos of Chai and Samosa for $2 each combo and two additional cups of Chai. 

I enjoyed the Chai very much however the wait time was a little long. When I ordered there was no one in front of me however I still waited 20 mins for total 5 chai and 3 samosas which were already there to be served. 

A man ordered after me got his food and chai ready before me I was wondering why?! Anyways..

While I was waiting for my food there was a caucasian lady who inquired about the price of \"that deep fried broccoli\" thingy, she found it pretty pricy and the employee replied her \" yes! It is very expensive, very expensive...\" the customer turned over and left without saying a word....as a customer I thought it was pretty rude that an employee emphasized \"ya it is very expensive.\" 

I will still come back for chai as its close to where I work. However the customer service def needs to be improved."}
{"text":"We were visiting Toronto CA in September, We were told about the multiple item buffet of this place, so wanted to give it a try. This place was packed, yet we were able to get our large group of 8 ppl seated together. The waitress were very attentive and served water and drinks promptly. The best thing to talk about this place is the Vegetarian Buffet it is around 150 items and all are amazing including the sweets and deserts, There was a Dosa Station too which offered unlimited dosa and very quick. There is a selection of Indo-Chinese dishes too. The lassi, and Milkshakes were large and amazing. Only one drawback is the Sabzi that they put in the Dosa smelled a bit stale, may be it is because of the end of day.  

Highly recommend this place for Indian food Vegetarian and for Indian sweets. Will look forward to going back there on my next trip to Toronto."}
{"text":"If you love spicy Indian food, then this is the place!!
You can enjoy a wide selection of street foods (pakoras, chaats) as well, in a nice fine-dinning like ambiance. 

Service is really good. Servers are polite and attentive. Foods are cooked with a wide range of selected spices and herbs, tastes good, spicy. 

It's located in a nice plaza, with ample parking spaces."}
{"text":"Visited this restaurant with a party of two. The ambiance was nice and the restaurant was clean. The waitress employed excellent customer service. The food was delicious however it did not arrive in a timely fashion. When we asked the waitress we were told that they did not have many cooks. Perhaps this restaurant can add more kitchen staff to speed up the process and get more customers in the door? The menu items are for individuals and not large enough to be shareable. The food was delicious and tasted fresh."}
{"text":"Super yum Punjabi food. Their buffet is amazing. Every dish is superb.

You will never feel like going anywhere else if I've been here once. Heaven"}
{"text":"Go see \"Muskan\" to have a MUSKANING experience. The man had a smile on his face the entire time and was extremely humble. Great Service!!! Definitely will come back. #muskan@brar"}
{"text":"Amazing atmosphere and decor,

The food was good but pricey, 

Something you never really see at an Indian restaurant is single portions. Usually you order a few subjies and naans for the table and you share everything. But in this case everything was a single portion. They've designed it that one person orders one subji and one bread item. 

It was an interesting concept, but we still ended up sharing amongst the 5 of us. 

service was also good, we didn't eve duo eating too long but if you arrive right in the middle of the after movie crowd, you'll definitely have to wait longer."}
{"text":"Decent food but the service was really really slow, it's took them 25 minutes to get the food to the table. When we ordered refills, it was 25 mins again. The part that ticked me was we ordered a Coke on our table which also took 25 mins to come on the table. The staff working on the floor does not explempify good customer service."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good; although it seems they are one of those Indian restaurants that use the same gravy for a range of curries. 

The ambience is nice and family friendly. Our server was also very polite and was well versed on the menu. 

The only issue was all our food didn't arrive at the same time. So some of us had to wait about 10 minutes while others' food got cold. They should probably work on that."}
{"text":"Ordered garlic, butter and Tava roti from their new location at Trinity Common. Pathetic experience, breads were super hard, unable to chew. If I could rate 0, could have done that. Not worth a single penny. Dinner experience ruined with high expectation of brand name..... Ack!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and food. A lot of home cooked Punjabi recipes to choose from. Mom approved and that's not easy to do!"}
{"text":"I don't eat out Indian food very much because I can just get my mom's wonderful home cooked Indian food. I love the fact that it's a vegetarian restaurant! 
But this place has changed my mind a little about eating out. 

The four of us were seated quickly, however, the initial waitress was a little soft spoken. Our glasses were not super clean. When I took a sip, the glass was salty which was kinda gross... 

We ordered some garlic naan, shahi paneer, matar paneer, and dal makhani, and a mango milkshake.

Personally, I've never been a huge fan of paneer in anything but I absolutely loved their shahi paneer and it has changed my mind forever. I was super excited for the mango milkshake which was really great except it wasn't cold which was kinda disappointing. 

Our total was about $43.00 which was a little surprising because the portions were quite small. 

TLDR: Food is awesome, price was disappointing, cleanliness is questionable."}
