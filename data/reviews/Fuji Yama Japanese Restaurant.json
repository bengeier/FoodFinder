I created a Yelp account JUST to write a review/complaint about this specific location. I'm only giving this a 1/5 review simply because I have to, 0/5 was not an option but definitely my chosen rating.

I have eaten at this location a few times, since it is close and convenient to walk to from my work. It was never a favorite of mine, but it satisfied my craving of sushi/japanese food at the very least. I never had any complaints before until now...

I literally just got back to my office and I could not wait to write this.

We all know how busy it gets for most restaurants during the lunch rush, I get that. The ladies I was with at lunch (there was 6 of us) weren't even offered drinks until after about 15 minutes of being seated. Didn't really bother us, but we ordered our food at the same time since we had the 15 minutes of sitting around with our menus. Our bento box specials came after maybe 35-40 minutes? We were all pretty hungry and ready to eat at this point. 

I ordered a 2 item bento box consisting of Chicken Katsu and Gyoza. I enjoyed a few bites of my salad, chicken and rice first. Then i get to my first piece bite of my Gyoza....

[Gross, descriptive statement warning..]

I literally GAGGED as I stopped myself from swallowing my first bite of gyoza. To my HORROR and DISGUST I pull out the piece of Gyoza waiting to be swallowed BY THE PIECE OF HAIR THAT WAS ENTANGLED INSIDE THE MEAT OF MY GYOZA! My eyes started to water and I had a few more gags after that. My co workers were completely shocked and as disgusted as I was. 

We call our server over to inform her of the current situation. She apologies and gets her Manager to come and see us, I asked to look at the menu.. but I lost my appetite after that, so I was contemplating on getting something \"to go\" to eat later on. Then I think, would I even want to eat anything from their kitchen ever again? 

That was the first strike. Second strike happened when I got told by the MANAGER that they would take care of that meal.. BUT!.. I would have to pay for my replacement meal..

SERIOUSLY!? If I were to go to let's say The Keg, and had this happened? Meal would be taken care of completely! A smaller chained restaurant like this? Couldn't even offer me a free meal? Hmm..

THIRD STRIKE. After I was told that I would have to pay for my replacement meal, she also mentioned that my food was not going to be rushed because they were very busy. As in, my order would be placed at the end of the line of ticket orders even though I had been in their restaurant for an hour at the time I was being told this. Waste of an hour of my life that I will never get back.

YOU'RE OUT. I was completely upset and disappointed at this point, then our server comes back and offers me a \"$10 Gift Certificate\" specially signed by \"SAID MANAGER\". For one, I would never go back to use this gift certificate out of pity because I would never eat anything from their kitchen ever again. Two, um.. $10 does not even cover the cost of their Bento Boxes. So thanks, but definitely NO THANKS.

I left a note on the counter stating my point of view, hoping that customers who fell in line to pay would see this, and that I would make sure that anyone I knew or read this would never eat at this restaurant ever again!

I gave them back their oh so, CONSIDERATE gift certificate as tip, because none of my co worker's left them a penny over what they owed.

So there you have it, my first Yelp Review. Share it and spread it, Fuji Yama on 5th Ave is NO GOOD. Manager was rude, clearly did not want to help me, and even told her server she was \"Too Busy\" to deal with my complaint. Great Job Manager, you just won the \"Worst Customer Service\" award of the year. Good luck."}
{"text":"Love this place! We always come in a group with groupons, because sushi is expensive... But it's decently priced for good sushi. The sashimi is always very fresh. I usually get the dragon roll (unagi- not as good as it could be, but still good) and always a nice piece of salmon sashimi. I can't remember what it was called, but I tried the one with mango and cream cheese and salmon... So good, but very sweet! It's nice to alternate with another roll so you're not overwhelmed with sweet sushi. I crave that one! They also have assorted plates of sushi and sashimi that's nice to get with a group. Usually we'll get that, unless we're not in a sharing mood, then the we get the rolls or something else. I can usually fill up on 2 rolls (about 20 pieces of sushi) and a piece of sashimi, which usually comes to about 20$, so not bad.  And I love their salad! Yum!

My husband doesn't eat any seafood, so he likes the teriyaki chicken, the teriyaki skewers, and the curry bowls (weird it comes with a sweet pickle, but he just picks that out) There's lots of other options for those who don't like seafood.

Never very busy, service is always good. Not terrible, not superb. Just good. Parking in back is usually pretty good."}
{"text":"I really wanted to give Fuji Yama three stars, because of the nice decor ( a lot cleaner and brighter than former Kyoto 17) and the food was delicious, from the crispy tempura to the awesome seafood noodles and fresh rolls, BUT it wasn't busy and it took forever for our server to get to us. Two of our dishes were forgotten about, and no one acknowledge that fact, plus they didn't care  enough to put away the giant pile of dirty dishes stacked two tables in front of us. With some work, Fuji Yama could be an awesome sushi spot  . . I'm crossing my fingers for them."}
{"text":"LOVE Fuji Yama! I discovered it a few years ago with a groupon and have been obsessed ever since.  Whether you do takeout or whether you go in to eat (I live just a few blocks away) their service is always prompt and so good. If you go in an afternoon, its less busy and you have a little bit of a quieter lunch. I also love the price. Can't complain whatsoever. Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite Japanese restaurants in the downtown core. The food is quite authentic and the service is good.  While it may not be as traditional and authentic as some of the other Japanese restaurants that I've been to around town, it is a convenient place for lunch if you're craving sushi. They have 2-item or 3-item lunch sets that you can choose from (which includes soup and salad) and you can choose from a whole menu of items (some cooked and some raw). It has items for everyone... so if you're lunching with some co-workers who're not die hard raw fish fans, there are menu items for them too. The lunch set prices are quite reasonable and in my opinion, very good value.

Not only is it good value, but the texture of the rolls and sushi is very good. I personally can't stand sushi rice that have been pressed by a machine. I'm pretty sure the chefs at Fuji yama hand squeeze the sushi rice as it is reflected in the texture of the sushi."}
{"text":"If you don't wanna honor your sale voucher, don't offer them.
I went there today to have lunch with my wife to take advantage of the dealfind voucher. I cannot believe they turn me away. I understand, it did say reservation required. But I have never been turned away if the restaurant is empty. What is really stopping me from turning around and call to make a reservation for \"now\"?  Did I already mention the PLACE WAS EMPTY? I though the Mr. Lube commercial was funny and a bit exaggerated, but I can't believe a real business will pull that stunt off!

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHmf-PPg9ZI&NR=1

If their intention is to use dealfind to promo their business, I believe they have just promoted there restaurant to be customer unfriendly, stubborn, and non-flexible to the needs of their customer. Might as well throw the money they spend to promo their business down the drain. Horrible!!!!!!!!
and I haven't even had their food yet."}
{"text":"used to work right next door so maybe went for lunch every few weeks and had a lunch special, nothing really great, nothing really bad - filled the spot. Had a deafind coupon so ordered outside the box and while the sushi was good the wait was not acceptable for a lunch time, about 40 minutes after ordering (despite repeated reminders to server who just smiled) had to gobble down and take half with us - so if you want something other than the lunch boxes, go at night."}
{"text":"Tonight was my second time going to Fuji Yama on 17th. I really want to like it due to its convenient location, but I just can't.

The first time we (boyfriend and I) went there the service was poor and there were some small quality issues. A big pet peeve of mine is when servers are slow to bring the bill or pick up payment after you have clearly stated that you are done. Our server was definitely in that category. The miso tasted off and the sushi was nothing to remember. Also, the top to the soy sauce was not secured or very full, so when it was tipped far to pour, the lid came right off and the remainder of the sauce ended up on the table. 

We didn't finish our dinner (which is rare for me at a sushi place), and due to the slow service, some lady who I can imagine was a little sketched out (I am not sure why she was in there), noticed that we weren't finishing it and asked if she could have it. I had no issue giving her food that we weren't going to eat... but it was unusual to be approached like that during dinner.

The second time we went there (tonight), wasn't much better. However, our server was very nice and attentive. Unfortunately, the salmon was chewy and slightly fishy, and the rice did not seem fresh.

I find that the prices are a premium for a product that is poor. Although I can see why they need to charge so much, both times I was in there only about 20% of the tables were being used. It is a large space in prime real estate... I can't imagine they will be in business much longer unless they get crowds, which isn't going to happen with their current food."}
{"text":"Yuck.

This is the new Fuji Yama location.  I was really excited because I heard that I really good chef was going to work there.  However, when my friends and I arrived, he wasn't there.

The atmosphere was really bright and cozy.  The guy waiter that we had must have been really new.  He seemed really nervous, but he was really nice and he took care of his customers really well.  However, when my friend went recently, he had another waiter and he forgot to enter the WHOLE SUSHI LIST, he found out after 1 hour into the dinner.  But anyway, the waiter we had was great.

The sushi was similar to the quality from AYCE.  The rice was way too wet that it made the seaweed super soggy and chewy (we ate it right after it was served at our table).  The quality of the salmon in our salmon roll was disgusting.  It felt like plastic and looked like it was rubber!  

We ordered a roll with mango in it.  At least the mango in the roll is fresh mango.  You can tell because it has started to change colour.  However, you cannot taste the mango in the roll.  

Long story short, the place was horrible.  The quality it similar to any AYCE place in Calgary.

Service: 4/5
Food: 1/5
Atmosphere: 3.5/5
Price: Overpriced for the quality 1/5
Overall: 1/5"}
{"text":"Good food and good beer and sake.    And friendly staff and usually parking available just outside on the street."}
{"text":"Hard to find and expensive.  Went for the open mic and sat in the regular seating area...discovered on the way out that there's also a bar (that goes under a different name, for the record), which is where the open mic is held.  But while there is a sign indicating that there's an open mic there, nothing indicated that it was in a differently named part of the restaurant.

The sushi was decent, not anything special.  I felt as if our server was trying to get rid of us.  She brought the bill immediately after clearing the table, and said \"take your time\", but then about 15 minutes later basically showed up at the table with the POS machine.  For the record, this was a Sunday night and it was nearly empty, so it's not as if we were taking up a seat that they could have filled with someone who was waiting.

Clean place, nothing special."}
{"text":"Good food - some rolls are very creative. Highly recommend the Flames Roll

Fairly slow service - took over 45 min to bring our food for 2, only rolls. There were perhaps 12 other customers at the time.

Would be back to try some more items of their creative menu"}
{"text":"A small update as I have now been there and ordered off their regular menu. Disappointing that they don't really have much for interesting fusion rolls. The menu is fairly standard though I was happy to see a former Kyoto 17 favourite on there: the Kushiage Chicken & Beef Skewers (tempura-style) ($8 for 4). I've had to downgrade my star rating to 3 because of their prices. A basic salmon roll is $4 and their age dashi tofu is $6! I think Fuji Yama is capitalizing on what so many businesses do on 17th and that is charge higher prices for the coolness of their locale & venue. While this is is a nice place to go for sushi, I think I'll jump into Kensington to Tenshi or Sushi Kawa on 4th instead."}
{"text":"Fuji Yama is a great restaurant in my opinion and is highly recommended for any one who likes japanese food or sushi.  Fuji Yama is a great value for the price, and both the food and service I have experienced is above par for any Calgary restaurant.  The chirashi don is one of the best I have found in any sushi restaurant yet! The Udon/Yakisoba dishes have great flavor and are prepared very well.  The appetizer list is both extensive and well done. I cannot comment on previous comments on rubbery sushi as I only eat sashimi. Recommendations include chicken and beef kushiagi, ika sugatayaki, soft shell crab, beef salad, chirashi don, and their lunch menu.  I've eaten almost everything on their menu and eat at Fuji Yama on a fairly regular basis. The service has never been below par in my experience and the food is as good if not better then similar restaurants in the area, but at a better price."}
{"text":"I've been to Fugi-Yama a few times and I have to say, it used to be better...

I don't know what happened in the move to 17th avenue, but the quality of the sushi seems to have gone downhill in both freshness and originality and the staff has a hard time with large groups or when it's quite busy.

That said, the cooked dishes on the menu are still very nice and you can't go wrong with the tempura, edamame, gioza or a chicken teriyaki dinner - but to be fair, that's not why you go to a sushi restaurant is it?

The best thing Fugi-Yama has going for it is location, it's conveniently located on 17th ave and is a good spot to grab a bite if you happen to be jonesing for sushi before you head out to drinks; but I wouldn't make this restaurant a destination for the evening.

T."}
{"text":"I visited Fuji Yama on 17th for the second time last night and I continue to be impressed!  We ordered salmon sashimi and a few different rolls including their featured fusion roll of the night.  All of the food was tasty and I had no issues with the salmon sashimi besides the fact that the pieces seemed to be a maybe bit on the small side.

Our server was very friendly and engaging and she accommodated my husband's gluten-free meal requirements very very well.  I'm always happy when servers have a clue and don't get the \"deer-in-headlights\" when confronted with allergies and food intolerances!

I found the service to be kinda slow but not so much that it detracted too much from the quality of the experience.  I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Found myself here on a Friday night with a group of 8 people. Nothing personal against this place. The staff are very friendly, but seemed bewildred by such a large group. They seemed to lack the artful assertiveness to take charge of the table and get those orders done. They also seemed to lack knowledge about the wine list. When we asked for umeshu, they had no idea what we were talking about even when we explained it. And they kind of left our table for long periods of time without checking up on us. That's service 101! 

The food, sadly, wasn't stunning. It was ok, but the Toro and Maguro could of been more succulent, the Ika could of been less rubbery and the Ikura could of more flavourful. The price is not bad, but if I can get the same quality at T&T, what's the point of paying more. Too bad, I wanted to really like it here because it's near my place. 

For all the knocks on the service, I did find them friendly and even fun.  It's probably what will have me come back one more time to see if I caught them during a bad night."}
{"text":"Right on the south border of Chinatown, Fuji Yama serves much standard fair to be expected at a Japanese restaurant. My dining companion enjoyed his udon noodle soup and some spicy roll (the variety of which I sadly do not remember). As it had been a hot day, I had a tofu appetizer--soft tofu served with some aromatics (green onion etc.) and bonito shavings. It seemed to be a bit messy to handle just with chopsticks, given the tofu wasn't firm. However, this appetizer was rather refreshing. For my main course, I had shrimp curry over rice, good rich flavors, not very spicy, if at all (I could have used a bit more kick for sure). And it seems a bit of a misnomer, as it was tempura shrimp covered with the curry sauce atop the rice. Attentive, timely service, paired with rather reasonable prices. The sort of place I would come back to when visiting Calgary again."}
{"text":"Went last Friday with Groupon in hand. I haven't been to this Japanese Restaurant, since it was Kyoto 17.
I made my reservation before coming, as per the guidelines on the Groupon. I also stipulated to the girl who took my reservation that I was using a Groupon.
First off I'd like to add the girl who answered the phone wasn't super friendly, nor was she rude. I just found her to be abrupt.
I arrived @ 6:30 p.m. and I told the lady at reception, that I had a reservation. She immediately asked for my Groupon. I said to her, oh you want it now ? Normally I would present it at the end when asking for the bill.
Whatever, we were seated and the proceeded to order. The gentleman serving us, was efficient, and took our drink order plus appetizers.
We ordered the following. Tamago sushi (NOT good here), the Battleship roll, (good), unagi or eel (good).
We also ordered beef Yakisoba, which was a good sized portion and tasted good. The chicken katsu curry (good), as well.
The waiter, was right on with keeping our drinks topped off.
We ordered $80.00 worth of food, since I  had a Groupon worth that much.

In conclusion, would I return to Fujiyama's. I might if I was in the area. It seems like there are so many Japanese restaurants opening these days, and it's hard to find one with authentic flavors.

I try and stick to ones that are still operated by Japanese people themselves.
To me its like going to a Korean restaurant run by chinese.

It may have good food, but it's just not as good as if a Korean person were to make it. The flavor can be off just a little.
A good example of this, is Teriyaki sauce. I get it sometimes on food, and for some reason it's been salty and runny. True teriyaki, should be a thicker sweeter taste."}
{"text":"My friend bought a $25 voucher (order for $50 or more, you get half price).  It was a Saturday night, the restaurant was not too busy and yet their service was slow. 
As for the food, it was alright.  We tried the Brooklyn salad, it was very tasty and refreshing.  I am not sure if it was just a one time thing, but I found their sushi not as fresh.  I am quite disappointed at this restaurant, to be honest, I had high hopes for this place.  
Their decor is quite modern, and other than that, I have nothing to rave about this place."}
{"text":"I really like Fuji Yama. There are the all you can eat places in town that we go to for the stuffing of our faces, but when we feel like a nice meal and some great sashimi this is our place.

It can be a little hard to find so always give directions like this - \"You know that bridal store on the corner of 8th Street and 17th Ave? The one on the second floor? Yeah. Its just below that\"

Service has always been attentive but when we have been taking our time they have left us alone to just chat and catch up. Always order a mix of rolls and appetizers and mains to change it up and try have something different every time we go. 

Never had to make a reservation as it seems to be pretty quiet alot of the time. They also used to have a night time bar on the other side of the restaurant that seems to be under renovation at our lat visit. Interested to see what it looks like once it is done.

Give this place a go. One of my favourites."}
{"text":"We entered an empty restaurant and were seated at a dirty table, then moved a minute later to the next (clean) table. We ordered edamame and 3 rolls, and it took FOREVER. Then the bill came, so yeah, they forgot about the edamame.

The sushi rolls were actually really good. The tempura stayed crispy throughout the meal and all was fresh and tasty.

Definitely worth the groupon ;)"}
{"text":"Soul Train and Sushi. Who knew those two things went so well together? Like vodka and gummi bears.

There are two sections to Fuji Yama. At night, she puts on her bangliest; spangliest hoop earrings, closes off the restaurant-only section and turns in to a restaurant bar with dancing... well... that is, if their DJ could figure out how to beat match. Soul Train plays on every TV, and there is a video dart game for those that are such inclined. 

Despite the awkward playlist, the Soul Train was much appreciated while we nommed on delicious rolls, three of which magically appeared even though we did not order them. The deliciousness trumped the mysteriousness, although, now I wonder if a Soul Train passenger was left longing for their Unagi. The avocado rolls were generous and perfectly buttery, and the yam tempura rolls were scrumtralescent.

Sad that I did not stay for stand-up."}
{"text":"Meh, nothing special. I'm not super picky but I won't eat anything so, it's no from me"}
{"text":"So, I've ordered delivery from Fujiyama twice, and both times I was very pleased with the service. The food arrives cold and fresh, with enough soy sauce for the whole meal. I recently tried the Boston roll, Yam Tempura roll, Caterpillar roll and Autumn's Peach roll. All were delicious. 
Delivery can take a while, but I'm happy with the food that arrives, so we don't mind waiting."}
{"text":"Wow!!! Not a good time at all. Came here for lunch with some co-workers based on central location in downtown for all of us. We got there at 11:45 and it was pretty quiet. I wouldn't say it ever got busy actually. We ordered our sushi before noon and didn't receive anything until after 12:30. I'm sorry but it's raw fish! I don't understand how it takes almost 45 minutes for food, when it wasn't that busy. 

Finally came, a friend has to scarf down their food as they had a 1pm to get to, as most people do. 

Then we got our bill...$95! for 3 people to eat just sushi. You've gone to be kidding me. I've never paid more then $20/pp. So needless to say I will not be coming back. I'm not paying outrageous prices for sub-par sushi that takes forever to come. For as many sushi places as there is downtown, this will not be on my repeat list."}
{"text":"Fuji Yama's service is slow and at times they avoid serving you during busy times, it can get a little pricey and they expect you to tip (even when giving poor service). The food is satisfactory. The real downside is finding the place, which is hidden in a basement of a old historic building and doesn't provide a good view or much natural light into the dark restaurant.

 What it comes down to is this: Fuji Yama's a reasonable quick fix when craving Japanese sushi down on 17th Ave but if looking for 5 star service you might want to look elsewhere."}
{"text":"Ocean Roll, Paradise Roll, Toro & Salmon Sashimi, 2 Large Sapporos and 2 Miso Soups please. 
I've had this order about half a dozen times. It's perfect, delicious & the right price when using the groupon coupon. 
Fuji Yama has become our go-to sushi spot, it's never busy, the food is great and the servers are friendly."}
{"text":"I bought a $40 for $20 Dealfind coupon for Fuji Yama towards the beginning of the year and finally decided to cash it in. The benefit of the coupon was that I felt like I could try things I hadn't before without feeling like I'd wasted too much money if I didn't like them.

Let me tell you - Octopus sushi? Not my thing.

We ended up spending about $20 on top of the coupon anyhow, with the order of sake to end the meal. The only disadvantage was the Sunday special on sake didn't apply because we were using the coupon. It might have been nice if they'd mentioned it when we ordered.

All in all, Fuji Yama was pretty good - fairly well aligned with the prices. It probably won't be my default go-to place but I'd go again if a friend suggested it."}
{"text":"I've eaten twice at Fuji Yama in the past month and like the place overall.

The atmosphere is very cheery, which is definitely needed when you dine in a basement location. When you walk in, a recording calls out \"Irashaimase,\" or \"welcome\". When you leave, it says, \"Arigato gozaimashita\" (thank you).

On my first visit, it was a dreary, rainy Saturday. There weren't many people there, however, we came in just between lunch and supper. The waiter was fairly attentive and friendly. The restaurant was clean and sunny.

My companion and I opted to try a bunch of appetizers (the 20% discount was an incentive). The Avocado & Salmon Salad was absolutely delicious. The explosion of flavours danced in my mouth with each bite of Coconut Tempura Shrimp. The miso soup was flavourful, while the Philadelphia sushi roll was a delightful surprise (salmon, cream cheese and cucumbers). The tamago sushi was huge compared to other places (not too sweet, just right). The edamame croquettes were also tasty, very tender. The chicken karage was nice and crispy on the outside and juicy inside. It wasn't greasy.

The only dish we weren't crazy about was the calamari. At first, we thought they were ordinary squid rings but when we ordered it on the next visit, we learned that that's just Fuji Yama's version of calamari. There's something interesting about the batter but the calamari was a little rubbery.

My second visit was for lunch on a weekday. My companion and I felt badly for the waitress for she was the only one taking care of nine tables. Needless to say, service was slower the second time round.. 

I ordered the tonkatsu (breaded pork) and tempura lunch special, while my companion order the gyoza and tempura lunch special. The portion sizes were comparable to Sushi Ginza, Tokyo Garden and Banzai. My tonkatsu was quite dry, so much so that I needed to dip it in my tempura sauce. Everything else, however, was top notch.

This time, I had room for dessert. The waitress recommended the ice cream over the pie. The green tea ice cream had just the right amount of matcha. Very tasty!

Prices are pretty comparable to other Japanese restaurants. We definitely want to go back again to try other items on the menu (just not the calamari or tonkatsu)."}
{"text":"I wouldn't call myself a sushi connoisseur by any stretch of the imagination.  In fact, I think I can count on one hand the number of times I've gone for sushi.  I've found some rolls and things I like, but to date I just can't get past the texture of the larger pieces of raw fish you often get in sashimi dishes (or always get?).

When my coworker suggested we go to Fuji Yama for lunch, she noticed my uncertain expression and said \"don't worry!  They have some non sushi things on their menu as well\".  And she was right.

With an assortment of cooked items and even rolls with no fish (I did consume pieces of the spicy tuna roll) - try the yam rolls - it was a successful sushi outing for this girl.

The service here could use some work, I'm on board with Amanda L's comments about the server being slow to bring the bill, but if you're looking for a place to get your feet a little wet in the sushi world, Fuji Yama seems a safe place to start."}
{"text":"Dark and dingy, in need of MAJOR cleaning. While the sushi prep area is clean and looked sparkling, the rest of the restaurant was LITERALLY held together with duct-tape. 
The vents/ductwork was covered in a layer of dust, and the walls and pillars (painted in white) are more or less grey with hand-prints and grime.
The upholstery on the chairs was thread-bare.  
The bathroom was out of toilet paper with none to be found. (that was an interesting McGuyver moment let me tell you!)
While I'm no snob when it comes to dècor and cleanliness, as usually the best food is found in hole-in-the-wall dingy little places, this place is NOT saved by it's food quality.
And really - if you're charging the prices these guys are - the food AND the decor and atmosphere and EVERYTHING better be top-notch.

I had been jonesing for Japanese curry, so ordered that. The rice was not fresh, the curry was most certainly boil-in-the-bag. (I ate enough of them in Japan, so I know the telltale flavours) and it was SOOOO salty! The salad that we got with our meal was simply a bagged salad (purchased from a grocery store) COVERED in 1000 island dressing...yuck.

My wife ordered some sort of roll, some sashimi and a few nigiri. While the fish was fresh, the cuts were strange, and the nigiri was cut so thin that the rice to fish ratio was way off...she said that the rice was not seasoned very well. And frankly the pieces of fish were so thin that they were falling apart. (not the best presentation).

Overall - for the money, there are FAR superior places to eat sushi in Calgary.
MANY better places to eat Japanese curry, and frankly places that I would much rather spend my time in considering the dark, dank and grimy atmosphere of the restaurant.

Service was adequate, somewhat curt and not particularly friendly. NOT poor, just not outstanding."}
{"text":"After a super intense workout, I felt like I really needed to treat myself and go out (not the actual way you should be thinking ;)).  Michelle suggested sushi and I was all in for gainZZ.  We were in Ramsay and thinking of a place when Michelle said that Fuji Yama was on 17th avenue and was good and decent priced.  It was about 7:30 when we headed over on a Tuesday.  Parking is free after 6PM on the streets.  I've never been to Fuji Yama before so I parked out front wondering where this place was.  I look down and into a window and noticed that Fuji Yama is literally in the basement of a complex - I probably looked quite lost but I followed the signs where it guided me to the back to enter where there is additional parking.  

You walk down a set of stairs, then to a little hallway where there is a sensor and you are (creepily) greeted by an automated welcome in Japanese.  We were seated at a four person top across from the sushi bar and it wasn't busy at all and ordered some tea first.  Fuji Yama is a modern sushi place with simple décor, comfy chairs and glass table tops. The menu has an extensive selection of appetizers, entrees, sashimi, sushi rolls, noodles, rice bowls, salads and Japanese curry.  I went with a house green salad, some California rolls, Philadelphia rolls and 3 pieces of salmon sashimi.  Michelle went with an avocado sashimi salad, gyoza, and Japanese curry with chicken.  Michelle's favorite is the avocado sashimi salad appetizer - pieces avocado, some mixed spring salad with various pieces of sashimi with a miso sauce.  I had a taste and it was different than I had expected - sweet because of the miso sauce but good.  The gyoza was gyoza, good but nothing special. My plate of sushi and sashimi came out and it looked delish.  I enjoyed the Philadelphia rolls, there was a good salmon to Philadelphia cheese ratio, the mango on top was a nice fruity touch and the rolls were nice mouthfuls.  The salmon sashimi was great! They were nice large fresh thick pieces, definitely money's worth!  Then came Michelle's Japanese curry, wow was this dish ever big!  Japanese curry is kind of similar to Indian curry but much more mild.  It the best mixed with rice!  There were some vegetable and lightly fried chicken strips mixed within.  It was a great combo.

Our server was sweet, came by and filled our waters as well as asked us how everything was.  It was nice and quiet so I would recommend Fuji Yama during the weekdays after 6.  Everything was reasonably priced and portions were good."}
{"text":"I can't speak about the restaurant, decor, and atmosphere as I ordered take out.  I decided to have the shrimp termpura and chicken yakisoba.  The tempura was delicious as it was lightly battered and not heavy tasting from excess batter cooked in oil.  There were 4 shrimp served in the small order.  There was a lot of noodles and pieces of chicken in the yakisoba.  It wasn't the best I had though.  There were ample onions and taste but it reminded me of the home style spaghetti my mom used to make.  It wasn't anything special and I was expecting a little more zing.  The food was decent and if there's a next time I'd try the sushi."}
{"text":"We tried this place with a dealfind. We thought everything was really good!"}
{"text":"The 17th Ave outlet of Fuji Yama, based in the basement of the Devonshire building, is a bit of a mess in so many ways.  The decor, minimalist at best, had tables that reminded me so much of hospital cafeterias.  The rolls, while adequate, seem to be a bit uninspired.  Service was average as well, with little attention except when we either received food or had to chase down people for something or another (like chopsticks).  I would write more, but how can I go through everything without sounds like I'm dragging the place through the mud.  Basically, the whole experience was just middling at best.  
Oh, their application of coupons and reservations are pretty much absolute as a warning people.  No reservation, no coupons allowed.  While I wasn't affected, the table behind me were.  Considering that the resto was actually 1/2 empty at the time, their absolutely insistance with no flexibility on using a coupon without reservation probably lost them a few customers for life.  The things I was hearing from that table were definately not very complimentary, and again, the place was 1/2 EMPTY.  Honestly, this treatment was just embarassing and portrayed this place in a truly negative light."}
{"text":"The rolls were good... The octopus ceviche was not my favorite; the avocado appetizer was very good... The service was not bad... I'm not going to say this is my favorite sushi place in the city, but is not the worst I have tried in Calgary. There are definitely better places in town; however the schedule of this restaurant is very convenient if you want sushi later in the night..."}
{"text":"I had the chance to eat at this Fujiyama location on 17th Avenue SW.  I find it strange that a restaurant can be in the basement and survive.  Even when we were there at lunchtime and there was no one that I could see in the restaurant.   

I had the endamame, miso soup, salmon sashimi and uni sashimi.  The endamame and miso soup complimented my sashimi.  I love, love, love salmon sashimi and the slices are just right, length about 2 1/2\" height about 1/2 of your pinky size.  Uni sashimi - just SMOOOOOOOTH!  Love what I ordered.  

Wait service was good.  Restaurant was clean with white and beige colours making it very open and cheerful.  

Thanks to my boss for bringing our group there for our lunch."}
