{"text":"Had a really great savoury crepe, great customer service and great food. Will definitely go back for more."}
{"text":"Best crepes I've had in Toronto. Great atmosphere and interior. I live across the street, so I love coming here for brunch on weekends. Fair price. Loved the Elvis desert crepe. Definitely try the gluten free option on buckwheat flour"}
{"text":"The best crepe I ever had.  Fresh, clean and ultimately tasty. It was a great experience. I am sure it will not be my last.  If my stomach can handle all the menu I won't leave until I try them all. I am just wondering what souse are you guys using!!!!! Delicious food and great staff."}
{"text":"Delicious food! Great girls that work there, they're so sweet. I love going there for breakfast or lunch, if you're a crepe person, I highly recommend this place, delicious!"}
{"text":"Amazing place to eat. Wonderful food prepared fresh right in front of you. Very accommodating for kids."}
{"text":"Amazing quality food and extremely reasonable pricing.  Try the buckwheat crepe for a healthy choice, or a smoked turkey panini."}
{"text":"Crepe Studio Bistro is located between Eglinton and Lawrence on Yonge Street. It is far from both Subway stops. When you go by car, it is hard to find a parking spot. It is a crepe place, but they have good coffee, too. I ordered Coffee studio. It was $3.50 and had good size coffee. The place is nice. I think the tables are too high for the seats, though. There is a TV. You can go there alone to have meals or have just a cup of coffee. The staff is polite and kind. I really like the place!"}
{"text":"This is a little caf√© European style. With a really cozy atmosphere. I got the crepes and yeah they definitely know what they're doing!"}
{"text":"Pretty good crepes! I highly recommend the crepe Benedict with chicken, it was really good. The classic eggs and cheese was not as yummy, but still ok. You get HUGE portions, if you just want a snack or aren't too hungry it's definitely doable to share one between two or three people. Also, the place is run by real French people!"}
{"text":"Delicious crepes and the service was lovely. We'll definitely be back. My friend and I each had a sweet crepe and they were very accommodating with substitutes for my particular friend. The americanos were well done as well. The best part was that their prices are so reasonable. Next time we'll try their savoury crepes.  We hear everything  is made fresh in house."}
{"text":"So glad that my friend and I stumbled into this little cute restaurant for lunch on a dreary cold day. It was a lovely surprise, from the great service to the quality food at a good price. They seem to have a lot of repeat customers because the two ladies serving and cooking greeted almost everyone by name. It completely satisfied my crepe cravings and will definitely wander back here whenever I am need of a good crepe.  I got the O Canada, which came as a huge folded crepe stuffed with pulled pork, bechamel sauce and cranberry sauce.... with a side of maple syrup. It may sound weird but it was delicious, a strange mix of sweet and savoury that worked well. The crepe itself was on the thicker side but was perfect since it had to hold up to all the filling and sauce. A great filling meal on a cold day.  The only draw back would be the location of the restaurant. It is quite a walk from both subway stations on a cold day and there isn't alot of parking in the area for the car. But definitely worth the trek on a warmer day!!"}
{"text":"Pleasant staff who are accommodating and welcome you with smiles (rude companies, take note). We tried the eggs benedict with chicken and one of the dessert crepes and their grilled cheese. All good! The eggs in the eggs benedict crepe were cooked and not runny, which is a win in my book. I especially like those PC pop drinks they have. Unique flavours like watermelon and mint etc. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"A wonderful addition to a quiet strip on Yonge Street (North of Sporting Life).  The staff are friendly and the food delicious.  Many wonderful flavours for dinner and dessert crepes.  A great place for kids and the prices are affordable.  We will definitely be back!"}
