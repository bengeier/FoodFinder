{"text":"Great Pizza, Great Price, Great People.  From street view this family owned pizza shop would not have been my fist choice, but I was being treated so I did not object. The white pizza was really good, I couldn't get enough. The seats were not very comfy and the decor is nothing to write about, but they made up for it with their service!"}
{"text":"Supreme and sublime. Best pizza and calzones (whole wheat) on the Near East Side.  In my opinion, the Near East Side could have a better pizza place. The calzones in particular -- made from whole wheat and with some 30 toppings to choose from -- are phenomenal.  Dave, the owner, will not only match any coupon, but he has all-you-can-eat spaghetti every day and $5 pizzas when you buy a regular pizza.  PLus, this place is open until 11pm. Which means you can stay and study. That's right - 11pm! The coffee place next door closes as a wimpy 9pm.  Sadly, because \"Pizza Extreme\" has a similar name, this local and independent spot has not received the attention it deserves."}
{"text":"I'm more than a little wary of cheap ny-style pizza.  I've made my way through a few different Lawrenceville spots and mostly felt pretty underwhelmed.  Greasy and boring seemed to be the trend, but I was very surprised by how I just couldn't stop eating the large cheese we got from Supreme Pizza!  I think it's the crust, super tasty, chewy, delicious.  I'm looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"Supreme Veggie & Punjabi Special - Confused between a Indian or a Pizza get the best of both world , I was very surprised how tasty this was a cultural mix that tickled the taste buds, It was fresh and warm , If you've never had something like this before, you're probably skeptical about this one, and hey, I hear you-it does sound weird, but if you like Indian food, I promise you, this is a joy to eat. This to me is a every day pizza where every element of the pizza has been revitalized and revisited.    The chicken Special  was a hearty, rich curry sauce, a perfectly doughy but crisp crust, freshly made, creamy cheese, and all of those tangy, spicy, chicken with delicious toppings. It was a great meal and much more interesting to eat than the pizza I'm used to A perfect job!   11/10 Can highly recommend."}
{"text":"Not a good pizza.  Crust is too puffy, sauce is too sweet and cheese is not very flavorful.  If you like the grossness that is Papa Johns, you will like the pizza here, otherwise, go to Graziano's.  Unfortunate because the woman behind the counter is very nice."}
{"text":"No no no. I don't get all these reviews. Yes the people are nice, but the place is filthy. The refrigerator stuffed to the brim with frozen food is the dirtiest fridge I've ever seen. The chicken wings served were freezer burnt and the cheese burger was bland and just tasted like death. Apparently the pizza here is good, but would you eat pizza at a place so darn dirty? If I could give it no stars I would."}
{"text":"I actually love their pizza, but the fact that their debit machine is a hunk of junk my debit card didn't work. So they tried cutting my card... I just took my debit card away and left. I'm very disappointed at this company and will never go back again."}
{"text":"One of the best hole-in-the-wall pizza places. Their regular amount of cheese is everyone elses' extra cheese. Very good toppings and their dough is very decent and tasty; wish they had a thin crust option. This place has really good pick-up deals so if ya don't mind a drive and saving a few $$'s, you'll be more that satisfied."}
{"text":"Walked in only to order only to see that the back tables were occupied by \"stuff\" that obviously belong to the owner/family?  So you can't sit at those tables.  The place is rather dirty.  Visible clutter everywhere.  Staff left while I was waiting for my food to go get ice cream somewhere?  I was left alone in the shop?  Odd.   Pizza quality seems cheap... Cheap cheese and poor topping quantity and quality.     Save your money...."}
{"text":"Even though we were the only customers there, we had to wait an hour for our mediocre pizza. At one point while we waited, another customer (apparently a regular customer) came in with his dog.  We watched as the dog walked through the kitchen area.  Yuck.  If we hadn't been starving, we would have left immediately."}
{"text":"Vincent's Pizza has another spawn, this one having slithered into Lawrenceville shortly after its birth.   Kay wanted pizza prior to the Danzig show Friday night. If you know her, you will find that peculiar considering that she is generally averse to pizza for reasons not fully understood by anyone.  We ordered an 8 cut Meat Lover's, and I was surprised at how it differed from the slices I had the last time I stopped in.   It's a sloppy, oily pizza, just like Vincent's but tamer; Mighty Joe Young as opposed to King Kong. I.E. it's a bit easier to eat and not as horrifically epic. If Vincent's is too much for your heart to take, try a Supreme Pizza instead. Accessible would be the most appropriate descriptor.   The crust is angelic, delicate despite it's charred exterior and is worth the price alone. Not that I didn't like my sidewalk cuts from close to a year ago, but the whole pies are even better, stratospherically better.   Kay beat me 5 -3. That never happens. If she liked it...  Support Supreme Pizza ya beatniks. They do good work and are nice people."}
{"text":"Tasty pizza, but hardly supreme.  We ordered a 12 inch thick crust double bacon cheeseburger pizza, and paid about $15. The crust was thick, soft and tasty, but the sauce seemed to be straight tomato paste with no seasonings aside from an excessive amount of oregano. They were stingy on the meat, to the point that we had to hunt for the bacon and even the hamburger seemed overwhelmed by the flavors of oregano and pickles (yes, they put pickles on their cheeseburger pizza).  I enjoyed the food, but there are a lot of pizza places in Madison, and you can get better food for less at most of them."}
