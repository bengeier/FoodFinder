{"text":"I agree w/ the previous comment. Service was very poor and waitress kept on telling us that they have only 1 chef  and that was the reason why the food came so late. Food wise, nothing special."}
{"text":"Live band Friday night!! With delicious food, they know how to prepare the meat... I am a pure cannibal and I can't remember when was the last time I had soo yummy goat!   Generous plate, and it is all you can eat before 9pm. For $7.99 on a Friday? You cannot go wrong!!"}
{"text":"Ordered 6 Rye and Ginger and 2 shots of tequila. They water down the drinks. I'm sure others have experienced this but didn't realized. Try spending $200 in drinks in this restaurant you won't feel single alcohol in your system. Don't let me start with the waitress and their service! This will be our last time here."}
{"text":"The food is awful and not worth it.  The women who is doing the barbeque is extremely rude and unfriendly.  I think she doesn't know the meaning of customer service and respect.  One tip to everybody, don't waste your money on this place.  There are other filipino restaurant around the plaza that is far better than this junk.  I cant put a zero that is why I rated it one star."}
{"text":"Their barbecue on a stick is yummy and so as their sisig, but the SERVICE? OMFG. shut this place down. You guys suck with your service. It's quite embarassing. Never going back again.    Maybe for takeout?"}
{"text":"We've been driving past this spot for years and always wanted to try it. A group of us went on Friday evening and it was a blast.   First the food. If you've never had Filipino food before the buffet is a perfect introduction. Though I would avoid the fish, it is Talapia which isn't a very good fish. The Pork Belly is rich and buttery smooth with just a hint of spice. All the vegetable dishes were really tasty. The real star here is the barbecued skewers of pork and chicken that they cook fresh outside on the patio.   The service is fast and friendly though a little chaotic due to the crush of people on a Friday night.   If you have a large enough group and are feeling like a real party book the Budda's table which is a communal dinner of just about everything on the menu served on grape leaves and rice. It has to be seen to be believed."}
{"text":"Terrible service, food came an hour and half later cold and terrible. Very short staffed and no customer service  Our bill was redone 3 times and was still inaccurate, we just wanted to get the hell out."}
{"text":"This is my second visit to the restaurant. I chose all you can eat this time and was served by a lady. The first visit I chose a la carte. I liked it thats why I went again. After this I wouldn't come again.  This time, I was expected to take a seat myself and pay by the bar. When I paid, she already charged me my 10% gratuity and was prompted again for more tips in the debit/credit machine.   I would have tipped regardless but if I did not check my receipt I would have tipped 2 TIMES.   Food For a la carte, appetizers are expensive. $12 for 5 pieces of lumpiang shanghai. That is a price for a meal so I just tried the lechon and some rice.   For the buffet, i tried everything. All of it are not rich in flavors. It is $9.99 per person so it is incredibly cheap but still not worth my money. It tasted so bland."}
{"text":"The Filipino food was good and the bbq was extremely well done. If you haven't been here before it can be a confusing atmosphere because there isn't really a server and you are expected to seat yourself.  I would say this is a neighbourhood Filipino hot spot where everyone knows each other.   The buffet ($11.99) is decent with some Filipino favourites such as kare kare, adobe and pansit.   We also ordered bbq skewers and lumpia on the side which were delicious.  My tip would be come for the variety of food but don't expect much service - for the price of the food, it doesn't really matter."}
{"text":"My friends and I originally planned to come as a table of 6 and had preordered one of the preset boodle fight meals. We ended up being a party of 4 and we weren't able to reduce the food portions since it was ordered in advance.  The food itself was mediocre. I find that I've had much more flavourful food Filipino food. The rice wasn't very soft and although the spread was nice, that's as good as it got.  We were given the option of using our hands (they provide gloves) or utensils. My group opted for utensils as one of my friends said the gloves made the food taste funny (he had tried the place with gloves before). The spread comes with some veggies (okra, eggplant, and a bowl of stewed veggies), squid, skewered pork, grilled pork, shrimp, and a small fish - none of which particularly stood out.  The meal wasn't especially cheap at $24 per person. I don't  think we would have gotten the service we received if my friend didn't speak Tagalog to the servers!  All in all, don't think I'll be coming back!"}
{"text":"The smell of the outdoor BBQ was what drew me in. Unfortunately, the smell was the best part of my experience. I went inside and no one seated is until one of the customers alerted the server and the selection at their buffet set up was unappetizing at best. We went back out to try their BBQ skewers and the lady who was BBQing was simply rude. The meat itself was ok, the sauce was tasty but I would definitely not recommend this place or come back again. Once was more than enough."}
{"text":"WARNING: It looks bad but tastes good...BUT it's not good.  Whole family suffered stomachaches from the food.  We ordered: BBQ: pork and chicken, goat, beef cubes in a gravy and pork short ribs in sauce.  Something wasn't made right."}
{"text":"Food is good but horrible service, waitress don't seem to care and you have to remind them about food and drinks more than once."}
{"text":"last night  after we watch toronto maple leafs hockey  i don't  feel like eating out and it's  late so we went and we order take out. they have a camera to the kitchen and i saw the other chef picking some of our food and he's  eating  it. That's  disgusting. i pay for my order and said something  to the server but she's  playing dumb. NEVER GO BACK TO THIS PLACE YOU CANT  TRUST THEM HOW THEY HANDLE THE FOOD. WORST EXPERIENCE  EVER. ...."}
{"text":"Pork/chicken Bbq is tender and saucy.  At $3 a piece, and CASH only.....no receipt given, Revenue Canada civil servants (ahem...me) better not patronize this establishment.  I only bought three.  Will not come again; I don't like cash-based restaurants; they cheat on their taxes.  Period.  While the rest of us pay."}
{"text":"They offer all you can eat buffet dinner from Monday to Thursday at $9.99 and weekend at $11.99. Food was generally okay and fresh but we didn't understand that they didn't have any pancit noddle options which is a stable in Filipino cuisine. But their service is terrible that no one came to our table to collect dishes or offer a glass of water (we had to go get our water at the bar and threw out our own dirty dishes into bins!) They are more focused on selling alcohol beverages and Karaoke stuff than running a restaurant. Come here for a cheap dinner but do not expect any service and as some other reviewer said, don't bring a date to impress."}
{"text":"Good food and service was ok. I've never gone when they are really busy tho. No where in the peel region can touch this place in taste. Their sisig is amazing. Sad it's pretty far from my house."}
{"text":"Do not go to this place I know its tempting because they B.B.Q the meat on the outside patio, but that's why i got sick in the first place. I ordered a chicken and pork on a stick from the bbq lady. She freaked out on me when I changed my order within 10 seconds of still talking to her. The chicken was cold on the inside after eating two pieces I took the rest home to microwave to make sure it was cooked. I had a stomach virus which kept me in bed for a few days. Service is horrible and the food was not really cooked."}
{"text":"Very poor service,they served us cold food,and worst part was the HAIR on the food.Luckily I noticed it right away but loss my appetite.Will never go back to this place."}
{"text":"FOOD:  Pro: The only thing I liked here is their Pork BBQ which they cook outside/in front of the restaurant, and the live band on Saturday night (Singers are really great).   Con: Don't bother trying out the buffet, it's MEH. Sisig here is good, not great but I will give it a shot next time still.   AMBIANCE:  Pro: They have an acoustic live band on some nights like Saturday nights. The male singers I've heard so far are really good. They give a good vibe on this restaurant.   SERVICE:  Con: The staff looks like they are mad at you every time you call them to order or to ask something. They are not smiling and looks like they have a lot of tension.   Pro: The owner is very friendly though, he will usually ask you how's the food, which is great."}
{"text":"Buffet style restaurant.  The taste is ok on some of the items but out of ten items on the buffet only 2 were good.   The spicy eggplant dish was actually really good and the curry chicken was ok!  The place is run down and not the cleanest place.   I would suggest not bringing a date here!  And for the price $15 for lunch on Saturday the value for what you get is not worth it.   I can't  say that I would rush back but I would try quite a few restaurants around first!   Overall not the best but if your adventuress, go for it!"}
{"text":"Did not get to dine in because of lack of supply of food got disappointed as we came all the way from Mississauga and went into an hour and 30 mins of travel time . Suggestion to the management is to anticipate people traffic since they have a viral video and a lot of people are very eager to try their menu and this is a great time to boost their clientele.I would return to taste their famous delicacies and hopefully it won't disappoint me this time."}
{"text":"One of my friend took us there, she is Filipino and she likes the food here very much. We tried buffet here, the fish head soup is good. Recommend to you if you wanna try Philippines food in Toronto. The location is not convenient but the car parking is ready."}
