{"text":"Great place. They will be seeing more of me. Good food, good area to stop in, and stay"}
{"text":"Food is horrible..... The place is called taquitos and beers, and they serve you microwaveable taquitos......Nothing made fresh or from scratch..... Just a dive bar, good for a cold beer....."}
{"text":"I'm loving Ricky the bartender. He's attentive, quick witted & knowledgeable. I can recommend the Sonora Dogs, Fish tacos, Civeche Tostadas & Ricky. We tried the fish & chips & yeah not so hot unfortunately, but hey that's what we get for trying fish & chips at a place called Tacquitos & Beer. Right? Right!
Definitely try Tacquitos & Beer if you're in the SW Valley. So fun!"}
{"text":"Was hoping to have a place nearby that is fun with fresh Mexican food.  The place there prior used all real ingredients and had great cooks and fun regulars.

It is a fine place to get a beer buzz....Staff is a bit clueless and inexperienced.   

Most advice:  USE FRESH PRODUCT.  Everything there is (tastes) frozen or canned.  You know the Guac is not hand made when it is thin as ketchup.  This comes from many years in a kitchen.  :)  You will double your business using better product!  Good luck!"}
{"text":"Great find.  Small neighborhood place with some good eats and can't go wrong with beers and a full bar.  Went for the first time and it will not be the last.  It's close to home and fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"How do you call yourself \"taquitos and beer\" and not have taquitos? My boyfriend and I stopped by this establishment on Saturday, hoping to get \"Taquitos\" and after ordering them the young incompetent waitress tells us they are out, how!? We end up getting jalape√±o poppers which were typical frozen poppers and some street tacos which had bland carne asada.. Overall  this place was a disappointment.. We most likely will not be returning."}
{"text":"Good place right near our house. I really want this place to make it!  They have a decent menu, and serve great margaritas. The last bar/restaurant had to close down and we miss having a local hangout. Fridays and Saturdays they usually have some form of live music. They also have a great bar with HUGE TV's to watch all the games. Recently they added a couch/lounge area to relax near the back of the restaurant.  I highly suggest the marinated pork street tacos! Give them a try!"}
{"text":"I think this is a nice addition to the area. Locally owned and operated by what seems like a group of 3 or so women. Food is good. Taquitos I wouldn't recommend because they seem to have more tortilla than meat. The street tacos are pretty good though, I recommend the marinated pork. The happy hour is definitely good, usually 2.50-3.50 beers and a few different shot specials. The girl at the bar seemed very short handed and had too many people to tend to but once it hit 730 or so a few more people came in to help. 

The music is interesting. One minute they are playing biggie and tupac and the next they are playing some all Spanish dance music then they are playing TLC. 

All in all I think it's a good spot, if we want to be in the local area and not too far from home."}
{"text":"Food and service is unacceptable. But you can enjoy dining with twitchy vagrants that may eat your leftovers for you."}
{"text":"Sheesh, there is a tough crowd around here I guess!  I'm not sure where else they are going but last I checked, there isn't anywhere better anywhere close.  Seriously, if you live nearby (which I do), you will realize that the closest bars are up at 75th & Thomas or 99th & McDowell.  Drinking & driving is no bueno so stay local and give this place a shot!

Let's be honest, this place isn't a classy, trendy spot that is where you want to go to get laid or have a wild night out with friends.  This place is your typical local bar where you get to know the bartenders and go in for a drink or two or ten.  Nothing fancy inside but it has seats to sit your a$$ down and what else do you need in a bar?

Let me highlight a few things... 
- Great drink specials for Happy Hour!  Nice, strong drinks and their well liquor doesn't make me sick like most of them do.  
- Great bartenders who remember your order and actually talk to you (if you are friendly and not a complete a$$hole).  
- Best damn tacos from a bar ever!  I love, love, love their pork tacos!  Chicken and steak tacos are good too.  Tuesday's are Taco Tuesday so all tacos are $1.  Muy importante... DON'T go in here expecting americanized crap with lettuce, tomato and cheese on them.  These are the mini street tacos with pico and their addicting guac verde schtuff.
- They have this green sauce, guacamole verde or avocado verde or something along those lines, it is out of this world!  It has guacamole flavor but thinner like a salsa.  Just trust me, it's good!  
- They have a few big TV's that you can see very well from the bar (and I think the seats too but not 100% sure) and they usually have a few options on."}
{"text":"Not a very popular joint food is alright sort of bland. Think prices are a little high on food especially since they don't come with sides"}
{"text":"By far some of the worst Nachos I have ever had. I would have had better nachos at a run down tweeker 7/11. I am pretty sure I just gave myself food poisoning.  I am from El Paso and I know good mexican food and this is far from it.  None of the cheese was melted and they used can nacho cheese also.. you can totally tell the pulled everything out of a can."}
{"text":"Last 2 times I stopped in they were closed even thou according to the hours on the door they had opened hours ago. Tried calling and just got v.m. .  No note saying they'd be back soon. Nothing.  Luckily i hadn't planned on meeting a friend there."}
{"text":"I recently just discovered this place, and thought I would give a review on it. As far as where it is located, I think it is in the perfect spot since there are not that many bars in the area. As far as the food goes, I only have ever tried the street tacos which on Tuesdays are only $1.00, you can't beat that price with the other restaurants near by. The atmosphere is ok, the windows are dark so it's pretty cool inside with the heat. Our waitress was really nice, but I am willing to try other things that the tacos. If you're in the mood to relax, then this is definitely the place to be."}
{"text":"was hoping to find a convenient and friendly regular since it's less than a mile from my home. 
my brother and I went on a Saturday afternoon for a quick bite and a few beers. The food was just average. my brother had fish and chips (probably frozen fish patties), and i had a carne asada burrito. the worst part that I have to mention is that the food made me sick for over 3 straight days (in an embarrassing way). 
for dessert we had a cookie sandwich, which was just a scoop of vanilla ice cream sandwiched between 2 store bought and stale cookies. 
unfortunately there was just nothing remarkable about the place. I've been wanting to give it a second chance, but I don't want to risk getting sick again. 
only reason for 2 stars is because the place has potential, and I'm sure they can make a place I'd love to bring my friends to."}
