{"text":"AMAZING!! We had the crab fries, the Brussel sprouts, the Gotti's lux  burger and the Salmon BLT.. Divine.. Dana took great care of us.. We couldn't eat all.. My new favorite place.."}
{"text":"i have been meaning to get in this place for the past few months.  Finally a lunch date suggested it so we went.  It was fun to order off the selection list, all kinds of options from 6 different types of buns, different size burgers, and meat etc.  Sort of like filling out a Sushi order!  Burger arrived and it was delicious.  Usually i would only eat half but i couldn't stop, ate the entire thing!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! We walked right in on a Saturday night and got seating right away. Manny was our waiter and he was awesome! Such a pleasant environment and amaaaaaazing food! Their burgers are so incredible and I can't believe the restaurant was not busier. If you love great burgers I highly recommend this!"}
{"text":"Cool concept but the beers are radically overpriced. Burgers could be thicker, juicer, more accurately cooked, etc., esp. for a place with burgers in their name. Good service though."}
{"text":"Been there twice and two different experiences. First time, my burger was cooked perfectly and was very juicy. The second time my burger was well done (ordered medium) and super dry. I have not eaten in the dining room so my experiences are only in the bar. The layout of the place is very strange. I know they took one large restaurant and cut it in half. You can kind of tell once you are in there. The bartender was pleasant and helpful. There was poor planning in the design. The bartender services the tables in the bar yet there is no cut-out in the bar to allow them to easily reach the tables. They have to walk out the back of bar and all the way around the bathroom just to serve a drink. Dumb."}
{"text":"I liked this place!  Been open about a year apparently and this past Friday was my first time in there.  Went in for lunch, sat in the bar area.  Service was prompt and friendly.  Their prices are MORE than reasonable for the portion of food I got.  I ordered the Quinoa Patty and it was HUGE!  Delicious too.  Came with roasted onions and peppers on top with goat cheese.  Superb.  I will definitely be back.  

Only thing I found a little odd was that it's a burger place and they don't have pickles.  LOL.  No biggie tho."}
{"text":"(Decided to give this place a second shot. Owner reached out to me and genuinely wanted to make reparations for my bad experience last visit. I'm glad I did. 
Ordered a 1 lb burger, and oh man. I had to bite once on top, and once on bottom. They loaded my burger UP! Had the cheese curd appetizer. REALLY good with the Chipotle aioli sauce. Girlfriend had the lamb burger, and wouldn't stop telling me how delicious it was, she actually wants to try making it at home... and she's never even had lamb. 
Now last time i was here i had the onion rings... and was disappointed. This time... they literally melted in your mouth. The onion didn't slide out of the batter, nor was it overcooked. Utter perfection. 
If they can maintain this level all the time, then i highly recommend coming here."}
{"text":"Very impressed with this burger! I had the Notorious B.I.G. and it was awesome. The brussel sprouts were amazing. The beer selection was great also. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Wow!  I wish I could give this place zero stars...as in this place sucks, avoid at all costs.  

As others have stated, we purchased a deal voucher for what seemed like a lot.  We were greatly looking forward to our visit.  It happened to be a football weekend so we called ahead and asked if they were a \"sports bar\" and if they had NFL ticket.  We received a definitive \"YES, we have all the games\".  When we arrived, no one was at the host(ess) stand and someone from across the room yelled \"sit wherever you want\".  Nice first impression.  We headed to the bar.  They had ONE game on...the local game. The bar was empty so we asked them to put on a certain game since they had NFL Ticket.  After fumbling with multiple remotes and guides,  they tried to sell me that it was the ONLY game on.  IDIOTS!!!  We should have left right then.  

We decided to stay and use our deal voucher.  Upon presentation to the bartender, they acted confused and had to scramble to show us what was available.  The deal seemed pretty clear cut but they acted as if it was in foreign language.  What was listed on the deal was NOT offered by the restaurant. Ok, so we move forward.

I asked about their beers (their taps are way off to the side and barely visible).  The bartender couldn't tell me what was on tap nor did they had a beer list (really?!).  He did offer samples, but if he can't tell us what's on tap, how am we supposed to order a sample?  He then proceeds to pour us three (very poor pours) samples...OF HIS CHOOSING!!!  I got up, walked to the end of the bar so I could see the tap handles, and ordered a couple beers.  They were good.

The food...first they have had a huge menu change.  It used to be based on burgers, not now.  It's a totally different concept, not a \"burger joint\" which is what the name suggests and what we expected and purchased the deal.  Here we go again.  The bartender says they changed because there were multiple burger places in the area and more coming.  I heard a few customers complain that the \"build a burger\" option was gone.  I guess that was a highlight...hard for me to see any now.  The food and appetizers, which came out randomly, were just ok.  And the desert...premade frozen thingy...not good!  Oh yeah, and milkshakes that were to be included with the deal...not offered anymore at this place.  

And ambiance...the place seems cool and normally would've been nice but we were lucky enough to be there when an older woman was bitching (not complaining) about a baby crying.  It was mid day and the place had maybe four tables of people.  It's a baby for gosh sakes!!  Instead of apologizing and letting it go, this bartender spent in excess of 30 minutes sucking up to this old bag.  I have no kids and can tolerate an innocent child (yes parents should use common sense but).  I would've escorted this old hag out and saved my other patrons her annoying whining.  Instead he allowed his other customers to go unattended while he kissed her .....
 
I could probably continue but you get the point...No, Nada, Never returning.  Waste of time.  Absolutely the worst experience!!!!"}
{"text":"Permanently closed, & they have tried to put a BBQ joint in here. 
Although it's not real BBQ, the food doesn't even taste smoked. A half-hearted interpretation on BBQ."}
{"text":"The owner of Notorious Burger reached out to me after he saw this review.  (Not sure what happened to his response as it was here) offering to make things right and to comp. our next meal if we came back in to the restaurant.  We will definitely give them another chance - even though I can't print out his response since it is now gone.  It was so good initially, we'll give them another go.  ***To the owner - thanks for replying so promptly."}
{"text":"Very well done food. My only reason for 4 not 5 star is their selection of food. it's not a big menu. If they add more to the menu. Deffinetely a 5 star."}
{"text":"I tried this place for the first time today. I went there with a client and wasn't sure what to expect. First the service upon arrival was quite bad we waited a few minutes to be greeted and seated which is frustrating when you are on a time limit for lunch. We waited an additional 4-5 minutes for someone at the table to greet us and take our drink order. Also since this place is new and we were new, it would have been helpful if the greeter would have explained the concept and menu options and not just \"here's the food menu here's the drink menu\". So not a good start. 

The decor is more Steakhouse than speakeasy but I didn't get a very good view of the bar since we were seated in the main dining area. I agree with another review we sat right next to a huge window and didn't get that dark/exclusive vibe that you would expect. Maybe if I go back for dinner service it might be a different atmosphere. 

The burger was ok and I like the create your own option. I felt as though they should have had some explanations on sauces etc. Every time I asked the server another question he was kind but I could tell he was bothered by the number of questions I asked. 

Overall I was happy with the food but I wasn't impressed with my salt and vinegar fries. They also serve the burgers with coleslaw. I would recommend leaving this off the plate and offering it as a side. I personally don't know to many people that eat it and it seems to go to waste. I'd rather have the option to upgrade to a side salad or fries for a few more dollars.

I would try this place again but would go at night and order a different style of fries."}
{"text":"I have my fave burger joint in town but when im east Notorious is where I go Iv'e tried the capone burger and the truffle burger both out of sight! I have also done the build your own burger too and thats was every bit as fantastic the sides are great and plentiful. The prices are great for what you get very large portions. I've eaten at the dining room and at the bar the service was great on every occasion! If you find yourself in Scottsdale and itchin for a burger then give it a shot you will love it!!"}
{"text":"our waiter was very nice and patient. there were 4 of us and being first timers, had lots of questions. 

the burgers were good but they werent great. we ordered medium rare but came over cooked. we all prefer some of the other burger places in town. 
sweet potato fries were disappointing as I read a yelp review recommending them... the onion rings were good but again, not great. fried calamari was okay. Brussel sprouts were good but you better like spicy or dont waist your time. 
unfortunately, we won't be coming back."}
{"text":"The staff was super friendly and helpful , superb atmosphere in the building , connected and owned by the same people who run Cuttle Fish another great restaurant. I believe I have found my new favourite spot near my mums here , the list of specialty craft beers on tap is impressive and the burgers are absolutely DELICIOUS!!! I HIGHLY recommend that you know and try this place out ! Don't miss out!! Your truly depriving yourself of a great time"}
{"text":"The new menu for Notorious Kitchen is excellent.  Grass fed beef, Mary's chicken and lamb.  The brussel sprouts were top notch.  Check it out!"}
{"text":"I have been looking for a good burger place since I moved to Phoenix and this is the first one to fit the bill.

Let's just talk about burgers for a minute: When you're burgin' (meaning you have an insatiable hunger for a burger which comes from within), what do you want?  A third of a pound of meat?  Half a pound?  A pound?  These are all options at Notorious.  What about a turkey burger?  Well, then you're probably a communist, but they have turkey burgers too!

What about a bun?  Do you like a standard, bun?  Or maybe you're a healthy person and you want a whole wheat bun?  Or maybe you're in the mood for something more exotic like a pretzel bun?  Notorious has these varieties of buns.

So you've got your meat, your bun, and it's time for the toppings.  At Notorious I'm talking about some premium toppings.  I'm talking about aged cheddar, bacon ketchup, rich chipotle pepper sauce to spice it up, and avocado to cool it down.

We're not done yet people, because don't just bring me a burger on a plate because I need some SIDES.  Now a lot of people don't like cole slaw, and I respect that, because it's usually not good (PRO TIP: Load it up with pepper and you can get your daily helping of slaw and pepper at the same time, even if the taste isn't so great).  At Notorious, they have some magical slaw.  Is it the best cole slaw I have ever tasted?  Probably.  And they give you a nice helping with a burger.  Hey maybe throw it on your burger and go Pittsburgh style!  But also give their fries a try.  They're not perfect, but they're delicious with a side of bacon ketchup.

All of that for maybe $13, which isn't bad for a fancy lunch, and is damn good for a delicious dinner burger.  So what's the catch?  This place does get a little busy, and it's usually full of square looking bankers in awful suits.  But hey they're just loving their burgers just like you, so get in line and chow down."}
{"text":"To start off, this will not at all be a negative review. I might be a little overly critical of this place but where the rating was brought down a touch was the flavor. My overall experience was enjoyable to include excellent service, interesting and enjoyable food menu items, and a very large selection of local and national microbrews. To start off, we got the wings wrapped with bacon!!! The idea and taste was great, but one drawback was the overload of BBQ sauce. The crispiness of the wings held up surprisingly against the extreme amount of sauce. The bacon brought and extra crispiness to my bite, and who doesn't love bacon??!!! We also ordered the Kale Salad, which was not bad at all. For the main dish I got the lamb burger. A nice size piece if meat cooked to order, but lacked in flavor. The toppings added on helped a little bit, but I was hoping for something a little more impacting.  My other half got the grilled cheese. That was pretty good and if she was satisfied, then so was I. The 3 star rating comes from this place being good, but not great. I would recommend this place, but don't expect it to be the best place to eat in town."}
{"text":"This place sucks.  I would give no stars but that option is not available.

Saw their ad` in a mailer we received and decides to try it.  This place is dark and reasonably quiet.  

We were seated promptly.  The waiter greeted us and took our drink orders.  They have a great selection of IPA beers but no Hefelvisens - very unfortunate.  We looked at the menu and found the prices to be out of this world.  I know hamburgers don't taste better just because you are in Scottsdale.  Lamb burger - $13.00 with no sides.  Fries are $4.00 extra.  $17.00 for a burger that any restaurant in town will happily sell for $10.00.  You can build your own for a fortune and a half.  We ordered two beers and the lamb burger with fries.   Service was Ok.  Got the bill and found that each glass of beer was $7.00.  The ad said happy hour fron four to seven with draft beers at $2.00 off.  I questioned the server and he said you have to sit in the bar for happy hour.  I told him the ad did not say that.  Next thing I knew the manager was standing before me.  He said all servers know the beer is discounted at happy hour.  I told him that is BS and you are trying to feed me shit a`nd if you were true to your word this would not happen.  I told him they don't have the integrity for me to eat here again and he said he didn't want me to eat here again.  But, he comp'd the meal.

Spills on the floor are not cleaned up.  They just walk around them.  

Bottom line:  if you want to pay 150 to 200% more for your meal and take dishonest advertising - eat here.  Food is ok but integrity is not.

WOW!!!!!

After posting this review I received a personal e-mail from the restaurant attacking and telling me how bad a person I am and I need psychiatric help.  Does anybody need this type of treatment?  Especially from someone trying to establish a business.?????  This place still sucks."}
{"text":"An unexpected slice of heaven! To set oneself apart from the pack in the burger world is a task that few are up to. NB sets a new standard which others can only claim  degrees of jealousy. The menu has something for all.  Burgers grilled to perfection. You can build a burger in thousands of different ways or select from a variety of house combos. All of this with coleslaw that boasts a different twist and a craft beer or wine. Will definitely try and make it back before I leave town to try the lamb burger."}
{"text":"Once again Notorious Burgers knocked it out of the park. The appetizer prime rib bruschetta was amazing.  Fresh Italian bread fresh tomatoes and garlic. Amazing. Next the Gambino burger - a lamb patty well seasoned with tzatziki and bacon.   My wife had the Prime Rib dip. Wonderful. 

Justin took care of us. Great service."}
{"text":"Had a great meal. The Brussel sprouts are amazing besides the burgers being off the charts. One of our favorite gourmet burger spots. Kelly did a great job as hostess and waited on us too. Tracy is a great manager too."}
{"text":"Went in around 330 so the place was empty except for a couple people in the bar. Server was friendly. We started with the calamari which was pretty ok, could have been crispier. Along with 1 build a burger and one notorious 9, a side of fries and onion rings. My build a burger was pretty good actually...Loved the pretzel bun. The notorious 9 was ok, I believe it came with the brioche bun which fell apart immediately and this burger was a bit under cooked (burgers come medium). The fries and bacon ketchup were great. The onion rings were ok. I didn't like how large and thick the onions were. Not a bad first experience but probably won't go again as I feel there are better burgers around."}
{"text":"I had very high hopes for Notorious...
My friend and I went for the first time and decided to share the Capone burger, and at the recommendation of our server, the Notorious Fries.

Everyone working here seemed almost sad. No energy at all, but still friendly...

The burger came out on two plates, which I love when you split something! It was piled high with egg (yolk still runny, yes!), avocado, onion strings, cheese..it was huge! So glad we decided to share. The burgers also come with a side of slaw, it has almost an Asian type flavor, not my favorite, but OK.
The burger was great! The flavors were good and the bun held up to all of the generous toppings.

The side dishes is where Notorious goes wrong. The Notorious Fries were really bad. I love chickpeas so this seemed right up my alley, but they tasted like a mix of tofu and Styrofoam. Absolutely no flavor at all. The dipping sauce that comes with them is the only saving grace. We ended up sending them back and asking for onion rings instead.

The Onion Rigs are HUGE! They arrive pipping hot and each has a thick, still crunchy onion inside, but the batter was again very bland. It's almost as if they just forgot to use seasoning on any of the side dishes on our visit.

All-in-all, great burgers, but don't waste you $$ on the sides...get a cocktail instead. :)"}
{"text":"Great experience. Great flavors in the lamb burger (gambino's broken leg of lamb) and the Capone burger with fried egg and sriacha sauce was also delicious. Great bun as it's light and does not overtake. Be sure to get the brussel sprouts appetizer.   Looking forward to trying other items. The s'mores dessert was a nice finish. Also a great bar. Many beers on tap and whiskey selection but opted for the wine."}
{"text":"The burgers were good, but the service stinks. The hostess, waiter/bartender were not necessarily rude, they were just not friendly. Can tell they don't like working there. They just wanted us out of there as soon as possible.  A shut up and eat attitude. Would we go back? No. There's plenty of other burger places who would appreciate our business."}
{"text":"The salmon on the salmon burger was the best part of the meal. Ordered 2 kinds of fries that were both awful. They didn't arrive hot and tasted as though they were frozen not freshly made. The tomato was mealy and the gluten free bun also tasted like it was defrosted. The concept is good, dining room is comfortable and our server was attentive. If notorious burger is going to make it in scottsdale, it's got to step up to some fresh food!"}
{"text":"What a disappointment. Great  food bad inattentive service. middle of the week and one bartender to help with drinks and serving tables. Although he was very polite and nice, they were short staffed and took forever for everything and dishes started piling up without anyone caring. The hostess kept walking by it without any concern. Several people actually just left without ordering. When I mentioned that to the bartender who came to visit from the sister restaurant Cuttlefish next door, he did not even apologize and had a smart ass remark.

The burger and appetizer was great. The small portion store bought desserts were the same price as entrees and definitely not worth the price.

What a shame to have good food but not know how to make customers happy."}
{"text":"There was a small wait for dinner on a Sunday night, but, worth it. Once seated,  service, with Ethan, was excellent. He was very knowledgeable of their extensive beer menu, and, offered several recommendations, when asked. We had the \"Notorious Burger\"as well as a build your own turkey burger. The \"Notorious burger\" came just as ordered, med-rare. It comes with cheddar cheese, nice crisp bacon, notorious sauce, lettuce and tomatoes. The bun was nice and fresh. They serve it with a side of their homemade coleslaw, which is slightly spicy and excellent. The build-your-own,was a turkey burger, which was also excellent. We ordered a side of homemade regular fries and a side of their homemade onion rings. The fries are served with tomato bacon ketchup. All of the food came promptly and freshly prepared. The onion rings were huge and nicely battered. Next time I would order one, and, not both, because it was a lot of food. The burgers are large and juicy, with very flavorful beef. No room for desert. We would definitely return. They do offer a full bar with a large beer selection. I would like to suggest offering a 1/2 and 1/2 with the onion rings and fries, that way you get a little of both worlds...."}
{"text":"Simply put, the best burger I have ever had.  Great service, and especially great craft beer selection on draft.  I know there are a ton of burger places, but this, as a nice sit down, table service is the way to go.  Started with the fries and calamari, both we're great.  And the fries come with bacon ketchup!!!  Where has this been all my life?   Burgers were fresh, juicy, and perfectly cooked.  And love the option to select your own type of bun ( go with the pretzel bread).

Finished off with the chocolate milkshakes.  Superb!!!"}
{"text":"YUM!

Service is great here.  This is a 'come in and sit wherever you want' type of place.

Their milkshakes are delicious.  They have a great beer selection.  Their burgers are good.  Plus, it's not too expensive.  

I will definitely return when I'm in the mood for a tasty burger and beer."}
{"text":"Last night was my families 3rd and final visit to Notorious Burgers.  Every time we have been there our food has been screwed up and we have just been ordering off the set menu, nothing was customized.  Wrong food had been delivered to the table, which we began to eat because the server assured us that was our food only for it to be yanked off the table after a few bites when they delivered our correct food. Wait staff has a shut up and just eat it attitude - gee thanks - but I can't eat my crab fries because someone in the kitchen added thin jalepeno slices!  This place is a waste of a night out, kitchen needs some serious training on the menu and food prep, wait staff needs to learn customer service."}
{"text":"Worst quality hamburgers in Scottsdale and worst dining experience at any of the hamburger places in Phoenix. Started with bacon wrapped wings. Great idea. Poor execution. Bacon was only attached to one out of 5 wings in a half order. The rest had an inch of bacon falling off of the wing.  Ordered the truffle burger at lunch time on a Saturday. Not busy at all. One other table 3.  Took half hour for burgers to come out. My cheese was wrong and should've been blue cheese. Had a slice of white cheese and the worst part, the paper on the cheese was left on and melted to my whole burger.  My roommate got the leg of lamb burger and they forgot to use lamb meat and gave him a regular burger party.  Whole burger was disgusting and overwhelmed with bitter bitter sunflower sprouts.  Coleslaw was bland also.  This place won't be open in 3 months."}
{"text":"They call this Notorious Burgers for a reason!  I have been working professionally as a restaurant consultant for over a decade and keep my mouth shut unless it is worth or not worth a review.

This blew my mind.  They are on to something here.  With Kale, beets, make your own burger with choices from beef, to lamb, to turkey to quinoa and over a dozen cheeses and sauces and about a dozen buns (including pretzel and gluten free,  as well as us carb conscious ones, with a lettuce wrap).

I thought I died and went to heaven!  A Chicago native who attended UW-Madison undergrad I can not tell people enough how goooooood cheese curds are.  Well....here is your chance!  Not only are they heavenly, but being a professional chef I know when you have taken the time to hand batter your own stuff.  They are super creative and makes you anticipate the next time you get to walk in the doors.  

I always sit by the kitchen or the bar when I can talk to the staff.  What a great group I got to meet!"}
{"text":"I had diner here and will come back. The atmosphere was comfortable and the server was attentive. My cheese burger was cooks perfect and I loved the Vinaiger fries. Nice draft beer selection."}
{"text":"I went here because I was aware that it just went in business. Therefore, I brought my mom and brother with me to give it a try. The location is pretty good. The lightning in the restaurant is a little dim. The lightning could definitely be better. Along with the lightning, the food wasn't that great. I mean it wasn't terrible but it doesn't meet Scottsdale standards."}
{"text":"Good burgers. I got the Notorious B.I.G. and the wife built her own. You get a card to check boxes so you can build a burger just like you prefer if you don't want one of the menu choices. 
I enjoyed the notorious sauce ( tangy 1000 island type sauce) on my burger and the bacon ketchup with the fries. Wife loved the \"grain mustard\" on hers.
Good food. I think they just opened up. Give them a try, I think you will like it. Beware, If you build your own it can get a little pricey. The preset menu ones are about $9-$12 which is not bad considering they are 8 oz burgers with toppings like cheese, bacon, avocado, grilled onions, etc! 
Cool Al Capone theme inside. Located in Shops at Gainey Village."}
{"text":"BIG burger was pretty good. Very high quality meat and bacon, and large portion. The \"special house sauce\" was just okay. The chicken pot pie was HUGE and amazing!!!!!  Would go back again and try a different burger and would highly recommend the pot pie to anyone.  Cool ambience and very good service."}
{"text":"We were disappointed on a Friday afternoon with the pace of the meal. Onion rings took ages to arrive and my husband's and my burger came 5 minutes before our 3 young hungry children. Were they too busy to accommodate us? Nope. Only 1 other table filled. We won't be back and this place won't last."}
{"text":"There's no shortage of good burger places in the Phoenix/Scottsdale area so it's a tough space to operate in.  The food was pretty good but the atmosphere of this place is tragic and totally counter to the concept of a speakeasy or mob themed burger place.  First, it's very bright and many of the spotlights are poorly aimed.  Second, the place feels like they ran out of money or were on a tight budget as it's very spartan and also very quiet, no music or ambiance at all.  Finally, the service was mediocre, slow, and generally blah as the staff showed little hustle or enthusiasm for their jobs.  

Very bummed out, was hoping this place would be a cool, dark, and delicious new spot to add to the rotation.  Oh well, back to Zin Burger or Rehab Burger, or Delux, or Stax, etc, etc, etc."}
{"text":"Not sure what to say about this place. Some aspects pretty good, others not so good, some prices not too bad but mostly it felt overpriced, and so on. While at its sister Cuttlefish we looked at the menu and it looked good and there are some good sandwiches. I had the Notorious B.I.G. Burger which was very good. At $10 it was the bargain but the burger itself was complete. One friend built a chicken burger for $12, my wife had a $12 burger and the other spouse had a lamb burger for $13. There were no sides included which at $3.50 and up prices a burger about the same as one at Capital Grille.  We had some soggy sweet potato fries for $4.  We had Bang Bang Brussels Sprouts for $7 and that was pretty good. It was the best thing we had though the burgers  were good enough. There is a decent wine list though the wines by the glass are overpriced to grossly overpriced. There is an impressive draft beer list but the cost of a beer is slightly to amazingly higher than what you see other places: I mean $7 to $9 for some beers with which I am familiar and would expect to pay $5 or $6 for at places I frequent, sometimes less  the whiskey list is amazing if you want to try some interesting ones. I can't comment on pricing for spirits. We sat at a table so I can't comment on booth comfort though I saw one couple move twice. Service was adequate but we actually had someone greet us at the door and seat us. Most people came in, waited, then walked to the middle of the restaurant where they were eventually noticed and seated.  Our waiter kept track of us and got us served. Would we go back?: probably not though food was good and service adequate. Price seems high for what it is."}
{"text":"Used a deal chicken to try out the restaurant.  It was delicious.  Amazing appetizer fries, good burgers and shakes.  Will go there again."}
{"text":"A creative menu, juicy burgers, and...I know, I know; this sounds crazy...incredible brussels sprouts. Really. \"Bang bang\" brussels--chili, peanuts, crisped pork, and kung pao sauce. If you haven't had a sprout since your mom made you eat one at the dinner table, you need to order these. The crab cheese fries was another favorite appetizer, served good and hot. My husband also ordered the crispy calamari. For entrees, I had the Big Poppa (aged cheese, bacon), and I'd be excited to try other ones when I visit again since there are so many good options that I had a difficult time deciding which to order. My burger was a perfect medium, as requested.

Service was competent, friendly, and very on top of things even though the restaurant was bursting with people (We went on opening night). We had Tracy, and he made the whole night even more enjoyable by his attentiveness. The drinks (whisky sour for me, beer on tap for DH) were delicious and generous. Way too full for real dessert, so we split a cotton candy. The ambiance was vibrant and energetic.

I should also mention that we brought our 16-month-old, and the staff not only tolerated him but brought him all sorts of foods and drinks to keep him occupied, well fed, and happy, which helped us adults relax and focus on the food. 

I'm sure that we will return to Notorious on our future trips to Scottsdale! In the meantime, I'll be dreaming about those brussels sprouts."}
{"text":"We ventured into the Restaurant  based on a review in the Phoenix magazine identifying their turkey burger as the\" best \"in Phoenix. We expected a great burger and got a mediocre burger at best. The burger was dry, the bun soggy and the toppings tasteless.
I have no idea how Phoenix Magazine  rated this place so high, possibly a good PR agent. In any case , if you want quality burgers , I suggest you look elsewhere."}
{"text":"I am not sure why there are so many bad reviews of this place.... The food is simple (burgers, salads, fries) but OH so good!! We also got beer flights, which were enjoyable, and desserts were out of this world!! We came with a 20% off coupon from the clipper coupons, and a dinner for four ended up being a $100 tab!! Highly recommended and coming back next time for Build-Your-Own burgers."}
{"text":"I really like this place. Very good burger, great beer selection and a nice menu of other items that are not burgers. I prefer this place to Hop Doddy, but I do like HD too. It's more similar to Zinburger. This place has a really solid happy hour too."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful experience. Great selection of beer, good happy hour menu. Burgers are exceptional, haven't had a burger so good in long time. Everything from the bun to the topping tasted and looked fresh. Will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"Came to the opening night with my wife and my 16-month old. We were told initially that there would be a long wait due to the number of people ahead of us, but we stuck it out and were seated within 20 or so minutes. 

Service: We had Tracy (guy) and one other gal who both served us through the evening and they were both attentive, friendly, and welcoming even though the place was packed and very busy. 

Appetizers: Since it was their opening night, we decided to try lots of everything...fried calamari with cuttlefish, bang bang Brussels sprout side  dish (basically caramelized Brussels sprouts in a Thai chili sauce with pork rinds--which I swear is absolutely worth coming to try by itself--ridiculously good), cheese crab fries (my wife had these solo since I am allergic to dairy and said they were very good, but agreed that the Brussels sprouts side was best. 

Drinks: Wife had a whiskey sour and I had Odell's 90 shilling on tap. Both were very good.

Burgers: We both had the BBQ bacon burger, though I had the dairy free bun and no aged cheese on mine. My wife had the the burger as it was meant to be and really liked what she could eat of it (we were basically stuffed by the time the burgers came because we ended up liking the appetizers so much!). My own burger was cooked a little past medium and could have used more BBQ sauce (which I should have just asked for), but still was good all in all. The bacon was particularly good and the servers let me know that they are looking for local sources of even better quality gluten and dairy-free buns. They toasted the buns so I did not have complaints there anyway.

Dessert: We were too stuffed to have serious desserts, so we split a cotton candy. I have never been to restaurant that served cotton candy for dessert! Perfectly light complement to a great mean given the fact that we had both eaten to the point of pain thus far.

Ambiance: open, mob family and prohibition themed. They were light on the decor but what they had was really unique and provided a cool vibe.

Bottom line: we would definitely go back and recommend this place! Expect the service to take a little longer for the next few weeks or so as they ramp up (they just opened tonight). Food is really good. Service is friendly. Ambiance is a lot of fun."}
{"text":"The staff is really great: friendly and attentive. I actually walked into this place by mistake thinking it was Cuttlefish. I only had an appetizer, the Bang Bang Brussels. I didn't expect quite so much sauce, it was kind of like a soup and drowned out the flavor of the food. The glasses smelled weird and the bar where I sat was dirty so I stopped at the appetizer and didn't order anything else :(

The place has potential as its in a great location. Three stars because the staff was so great."}
{"text":"Just ok. Ambiance..3. Prices...3. Burger...3. Fries...4. Service...4. Parking...5. Coleslaw...4.
Cocktails...2.
No kobe or Angus burger available. 
First time at this restaurant just ok not much to rave about or complain about. Will be about 5th on our list of good burger places. May visit again but prob. not anytime soon."}
{"text":"We were pretty excited for this place for some reason but it turned out to be just meh. We arrived right after it opened and were told to sit anywhere by the hostess, who was also the only waitress there. The booth we chose had a bunch of crumbs on it, which was odd considering we were the first ones there. Guess the night crew doesn't clean? Started with some shakes. The Nutella one was good, salted caramel was just okay. We ordered various burgers off the menu (nothing custom) and a couple side orders of fries. The burgers were good, cooked well. The crab fries were good but the pork belly on the other order seemed dry. There was what seemed to be nacho cheese on the fries which made it kind of soggy and overly salty. The bathroom was filthy. There was poop in the toilet (not the restaurant's fault, I know) hair in the sink and only a few paper towels on the back of the toilet. For being a fairly new restaurant it seemed it like it had an old bowling alley bathroom.

We will not likely be back as ReHab Burger is much better, cleaner and closer."}
{"text":"Good first impressions. Nice gangster themed decor, clean, good selection of drinks and food at a moderate price ($10-$15/entree). 

I visited during lunch hour on the weekend. It was a completely empty dining room, just one other family who already had their food. We ordered straight away, but still the food came out s l o o o w. I took my kids outside to play (several times) just to kill time. A few patrons walked thru the door and actually left because they couldn't find staff and were unsure if the place was open. That's a bad sign. I only saw one guy working the entire time we were there, a little over an hour. Despite all this we did decide to stay and order.

Good news, the food was very tasty. My burger was juicy and side salad was very fresh with just the right amount of dressing. That was a nice surprise.  Worth the wait? Depends on your schedule. But I enjoyed enough. One curious note: there was only one unisex bathroom. Even with a near empty dining room, I had to wait in line for the toilet. Ugh."}
{"text":"Our server (Anthony) was really good about pairing my taste of beer with all their selections of draft (2$ off on happy hour). He was patient, nice and knowledgable. Food was SO good. Felt like a taste of LA all over again with the atmosphere and flavors!!"}
{"text":"My family and I have been in Notoious  burger several times in the past few months and each time the experience has been wonderful. The food has been excelant, as was the service. A super variety of beers and ales on tap and a great menu.  Servers have always been great and attentive.
Way to go Notorious!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place has totally grown on me... they remodeled the bar which opened up the space a ton.  Great selection of brews on tap as well as some solid cocktails.  Can't go wrong with their burgers either.  Check'em out."}
{"text":"It was my first time there an I thought the food was awesome,  I had the build a burger an we all shared 3 different kinds of fries.  The cheese curds were the bomb!!! They could of had a little more help, our server was the bartender an the waiter, I think for the whole place but he took care of us pretty good!  Can't wait to go back!"}

Burgers Burgers Burgers can I taste

Came here with several Yelpers after a gather at the Cuttlefish next door.  Needless to say, same owner different restaurant!  

Thought I was just gonna hit up for some drinks, but I couldn't resist a good looking burger!  The place was packed full of us Yelpers so service was a tad bit overwhelmed!  After a few shots and a craft brew, we ordered the Capone Burger and a milkshake (yes at the bar!)  In the end, the burger was phenomenal and the ingredients worked well; habanero jack cheese, pan fried egg, avocado, siracha, and crispy onions - Yummy!  I'm a texture guy and this burger really gave my palates a fun time!  Spicy and crunchy at the same time plus the over-easy egg and avocado gave it a creamy warm savory bite! The milkshake was interesting order since I didn't think it really mesh well with the theme of the restaurant, but also my burger.  However, it was good.

Service again was in a way slow, but then again the place was packing!  So I can understand.  In the end, I would definitely recommend you to stop by and enjoy a great tasting burger with a few drinks! - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Disappointing. A customer should never hear \"that's my least favorite thing on the menu\" from wait staff. My burger came out before my appetizer. Bang bang Brussels were over-sauced. Doubt I'll be back."}
{"text":"There is a lot to like about this place.

First, the Al Capone gangster theme is pretty cool and the servers all dress the part.

Second, they have a great selection of craft beers.  I had a delicious Ballast Point IPA and a Stone IPA with my burger.

Third, my Capone burger was spicy and cooked perfectly.  My fries were very good and the bacon ketchup was a nice condiment.

Put these guys in your burger rotation if you're in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Bridgett was the best server ever! Seriously! Not only did she greet us with a smile, she was attentive, offered great recommendations and invited us back to try other items based on our comments. The coleslaw was some of the best I've ever had! The onion rings were really good although slightly too doughy for me. Will definitely be back to try some of the other burgers."}
{"text":"My husband and I were excited to try a new place. Our server was delightful, very friendly.  I ordered the Flat Iron Steak Salad with steak medium well.  When it arrived the bowl/plate it was served in was so hot that the server actually carried it out with a napkin.  Needless to say, the lettuce was like soup.  She gladly took it back and brought me a new one.  Unfortunately my steak was dripping in blood.  I ate the lettuce that didn't have blood on it and the salad was actually very tasty.  My husband also asked for his burger well and it was almost solid pink.    I observed a man send his food back and walk out right before our food arrived.  Seems a shame that a restaurant with good recipes can't get their kitchen act together.  It was our first time and we won't go back.  Too many new other places to try."}
{"text":"I wasn't planning on stopping there as I'm not much of a burger-eater.  I saw the menu outside & saw the quinoa burger which is right up my alley. It was AMAZING! it was a burger with roasted red peppers, grilled onion, goat cheeses (all melty) & arugula. Very very delicious. Nice side salad."}
{"text":"I chose this place as my pick for our monthly girls night dinner; we go to different restaurants each month & try new places.  I was very happy we went!  From the moment we walked in the customer service was great.  They seemed a bit short staffed, however the waiter/bartender was very attentive & didn't miss a thing. I had the Notorious B.I.G burger & it was excellent.  The notorious sauce it delicious. We also shared some of their side dishes; cheese curds, sweet potato fries & onion rings; all were very good. I will definitely be going back to try the other burgers on the menu & to get more of the cheese curds."}
{"text":"Our waiter was very friendly and helpful. The whiskey drink that he suggested (it was something with strawberry and vanilla) was fantastic.

I wasn't really impressed with the food especially for the price. My burger was good , but not $13 good without fries. The prices here are similar to Burgr in Vegas , but the food isn't even as close to as good. The fries were sweet and has a weird sauce with them that didn't have any taste at all.

It was just okay, but I probably wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for a nice little post party after last night's Yelp Elite Event, for which I was a +1 :)  Didn't eat or even venture into the seating areas, but based on my experience with the bar and bartenders, I'll give it a solid 4.0 for now and will amend the review once I've had the opportunity to grab a burger here.  

The bar is a little tight, with several pub tables against the wall, and the long bar opposite them.  It works though, I loved the ambiance!  Further, despite the fact that the bar was completely slammed with Yelpers, the bartenders were friendly and knowledgeable, service was good and quick.  I had a couple of craft beers, and was pleased.  

Nice spot to grab a drink.  Looking fwd to checking out the menu."}
{"text":"I really want to give this place 4 stars but just can't. The short version is that this place is flirting with awesome but, given a choice, I'd opt for Zin Burger over Notoriois Burger. 

Plus: awesome friendly staff, cool concept, great decor, good beer and whiskey menu, and great menu concepts. 

Minus: Burger was over-done, cheese in Dungeness Crab cheese fries totally overpowered the crab (gooey pretzel cheese), everything was so rich! 

Overall: I'll totally be back to see how they develop and the Living Social coupon that got us here was a screaming deal. The wait staff were awesome all around and we had a good time. Zin burger does the cool beer and burger thing better but the gangster vibe here was a lot of fun."}
{"text":"Notorious Kitchen is a great place for lunch or dinner!  I came in to check out the burgers and I was not disappointed.  I got the Notorious BIG burger and it was perfect.  Even the sweet potato fries were crispy and tasty!!!  I love the comfortable atmosphere and the service was really good.  Thanks folks,  I will most definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"This place is ok, not great, and I'm afraid does not set itself apart from the other great burger places in the Valley. First off, the good: almost everything we ordered was tasty, from the calamari to the burgers to the milkshakes. Good selection of wine and draft beer. Overall we thought the food and drink was about what we expected at this price point. Now, the not so good: it feels like this place opened a few weeks before it was ready. Hosts and service were harried, disorganized, a little confused about the menu, and though they appeared to be trying their best they left something to be desired. The kitchen doesn't seem to get the menu yet, as more often than not the food that came did not match the description. 

And finally, the biggest issue: the space. Other reviewers called the atmosphere nice, or trendy, or classy. We do not get that at all. The space is a very cheap makeover from the previous tenant McCormick & Schmicks. It kind of feels like it was thrown together with little regard for how the room flows or atmosphere. There's no music or what is being played is too low for the cavernous space and loud diners. Frankly, it seems like a fake restaurant built for a commercial where they \"surprise\" diners with a menu item being switched with something downmarket (e.g. \"see what diners said when we switched notorious burgers for Carl's Jr's Six Dollar Burger\"). Throw in a mafia \"theme\" that has you ordering food using infamous mobsters' names and it just seems cheesy for a place where you're looking at $25-30 per person for an a la carte meal with a drink.

Overall, while there were some service/kitchen problems and the atmosphere was non-existent, the food was good enough thst we'd give the place another shot in a couple months and see if the kinks have been worked out.

UPDATE: after posting this review I received a message from the owner asking about my complaints about the atmosphere and and asking if I was in his shoes, what changes would address the issues I raised. I told him what I thought, and who knows if the suggestions will go anywhere. But I do have to respect a business that listens to feedback, good or bad. I'm definitely going back and I hope when I do, I can add a star or two."}
{"text":"This place is a shaky three stars. We've been here three times (four, if you include the time we came just for drinks) and every time, we've found the food to be good, not great, and generally forgettable. Let's get to the breakdown.

We've ordered everything off the appetizer menu. I love crab. I love pork belly. I love fries, zucchini, cheese, brussels sprouts, and calamari. I should be the perfect customer. But the cheese on the pork belly little crazy fries and the crab fries are like a nacho cheese. And there's so much of it! It absolutely demeans the flavor of the higher quality toppings. Completely obliterates it, actually. The calamari is pretty good, but is not at all crispy. The notorious fries are a different sort of texture. It reminds me of a flavored tofu mixed with zucchini, and the sauce doesn't fully compliment it. The bacon wrapped chicken wings are pretty good.

The burgers are pretty good. I'd opt to get any sauces on the side, as they tend to be pretty oversauced, IMO. I've enjoyed the turkey burger, Notorious BIG, and truffle burger (though a very rich flavor, so be prepared). We've had good luck with them cooking the meat to order, so A+ on that! I've also gotten the salmon salad, which I didn't love. If we went again, I'd probably have to try the grilled cheese with mozzarella, prosciutto, tomatoes, and pesto.

Dessert-wise, my companions enjoyed their donuts and I thought their crème brulee was okay. The tiny sorbets can be pretty tasty. The shakes have been a bit thin, so ask for thick when you put in your order if you know you like to eat with your spoon. And they can have some great beer selections! I like that they cycle certain ones out. 

Service is hit or miss. But it's a good location for us with okay food and is nice to look at."}
{"text":"Decent beers on tap, great service, and mediocre everything else. Both burgers we tried had improper proportions of cheese to meat, very little toppings of interest, and there was nothing special about the meat-- you could barely taste it. It has to be a darn good burger to charge $12 with no sides, and that, it wasn't.

The website and online menu leads you to believe it's a much hipper, younger place but the atmosphere was lacking. It felt like a stuffy, dark place that older people would feel comfortable in, and it was mostly older people eating there.

There were two servers for the entire restaurant, one of which was also the host and bartender. They were super friendly, composed, and helpful. The water was room temperature which is a little untraditional for American dining. The music was awful... drab and slow.

Nothing we tried we would order again, and we're definitely not going back. Bummer!"}
{"text":"Loved it!  We live quite a distance and would not have just come into Notorious Burgers, but I had purchased a Groupon, that we used last week.  The place has an inviting bar and the dining room is club-like with dark walls and wooden booths and tables.  There's a huge picture of Al Capone and other interesting artwork throughout.
We were told to sit wherever we would prefer and immediately a server greeted us and gave us menus.  We asked what items were covered by the 4-course Groupon and he pointed out the couple of items that were not included. 

Then our server, Anthony, came by, welcomed us and introduced himself.  Within two minutes we felt totally at home!  The service could not be improved in any way---check backs were quick, there was time between courses so we didn't feel rushed, beverages were promptly refilled and Anthony made recommendations that he followed up on.  

We loved the food and found it far from \"meh\" as another reviewer described.  The chicken wings were wrapped in top-quality bacon and were huge ---- I swear they were from a chicken on steroids!  They were perfectly cooked and coated in an amazing barbecue sauce.  The calamari was not the usualy ring type, but rather cut from calamari steak.  The sauce it was served with was good, but Anthony also suggested we try the lemon aioli with the calamari --- amazing.  The burgers were prefectly cooked .  My husband had a more traditional burger with bacon and cheese and onion rings, which he loved.  Mine was out there --- with feta cheese and sunflower sprouts (I've never seen them before: reminded me of LIttle Shop of Horrors, and sunflower seeds.  It was fantastic.  The burgers were huge and we took half of each home to enjoy the next day. We took home the dessert that came with our Groupon package because we couldn't eat another thing.  We each got the cannoli which were made while we waited !!!  Can't be any fresher than that.  They were amazing, just like the best Italian bakeries in NYC and Boston.

At the end Joey, the owner, came over.  He was appreciative of our business and I promised him I would write a Yelp review.  My husband and I love mom and pop restaurants and have definitely found a new favorite spot!   When we want an amazing burger, we will jump in the car and ride up from Chandler....yes, that is how good Notorious Burger is.  Worth the drive!  The Groupon enabled us to try a lot of their menu, next time it will be difficult to decide what to order!"}
{"text":"I may be a little aggressive with my 4 star rating, because I haven't had a burger yet.

I've been 2 times now for networking meetings. Both times they've been very organized and done everything they could to accommodate us. 

Being a large group, our menu has been a shorter version of their regular menu. Both times I've gotten a salad with KALE, of all things (and it was super yummy).

One of these days I'll need to schlep the hubs over there and try their burgers!"}
{"text":"The best burger I have had in a long time! I love the build your own burger option. They have a good beer selection too!"}
{"text":"Somebody needs to tell the chef at Notorious how to form and cook a burger.  Burgers were overcooked and tough.  Our burgers were ordered Med. rare... They were served Med. well at best.  Burgers were under seasoned and my bun was extremely soggy.  Draft beer was WAY overpriced too.  

There are too many VERY GOOD burger places nearby... Sharing the same parking lot, Downside Risk and Village Tavern are FAR better choices.  I also recommend HopDoddy and Burger Rehab.  My wife and I will not be back to Notorious."}
{"text":"Amazing! Love the menu, drinks, and service! Everything I have eaten here has been amazing everyone is super nice and you can come dressed casual! Not to mention the music is great!"}
{"text":"Bought a coupon deal and tried this place with friends for the first time on a recent Saturday night.  Our deal included 2 beverages (beer or milkshake), 2 appetizers, 2 burgers and 2 desserts = too much food so we shared all among the 4 of us. 

Warning:  EVERYTHING here has bacon on it in some shape or form.  Now I'm a bacon lover so that shouldn't present a problem, but bacon, bacon, bacon - be careful because at some point, it becomes too much bacon.
 
We started off with bam bam brussel sprouts and Little Crazy Fries - fries with cheese sauce and toppings.  Odd to order brussel sprouts at a burger joint but they were roasted and quite good, although somewhat rich with very sweet kung pao sauce and a tad greasy for my taste.  The Little Crazy fries went fast so I guess they were good.  

Shared a Notorious Big burger and a Big Poppa bacon burger (note: MORE bacon).  Burgers were enormous by my standards and I was very glad to share.  They are tall too, not sure how you'd manage to shove this in your mouth intact but I guess some do.  

Dessert - NO bacon (whew!).  We shared some kind of little mini donut thing in nutella sauce with ice cream and more sauce stuff.  Donuts were a little tough but they tasted pretty good.  Milkshakes were also tasty but by this time, we were all pretty full.

So - I don't know if Notorious lives up to \"Notorious\" but it was memorable, the food was pretty good, and our waitress was really good.  The atmosphere is a bit strange, dark and kind of lacking any form or focused design.  The chalkboard art in the front entrance is cool.  And speaking of cool, it was really cool, no make it cold, in there.  Yes, the A/C works very well.  One small annoyance was the process of clearing/cleaning tables.  I guess the staff is just used to the noise but they were scraping chairs & tables across the slate tile floors making quite a racket.  Not the most pleasant background noise to eat by.  

There are so many specialty burger places available now.  And here's one more...  See for yourself.  Bacon, Bacon, BACON.  Nuh said."}
{"text":"Okay, so I gave this place another shot. And I am so glad I did. My husband was craving a burger and it was \"date night\" so we went here. The service was good (really great at first, then it waned off toward the middle and end of the meal). We got to sample different beers before finally ordering one so that was nice. The beer menu was very outdated, so you have to ask the server what they currently have. I got the chicken and quinoa kale salad which I was conflicted about since I really did want a burger but the salad sounded soooooooo good, and it was! My husband got the build your own burger. I love how you can choose your protein, type of bun (pretzel roll!!), cheese, veggies, sauce, etc. I was tempted to try the White Balsamic Mint sauce on a turkey burger...see why I was conflicted?!?! We also got the sweet potato fries which were good and crispy. My husband didn't care for the sweet dip it comes with, but I liked it. Overall the experience was much better and I am happy we came back."}
{"text":"We went here yesterday and won't go back. Bought a living social deal...first ordered two shakes when they finally came out they were chocolate milk, next the appetizers, wanted to order the bang bang Brussels but apparently no sprouts today, so we had the wings and calamari, wings were ok, calamari was like rubber. Moving on to the burgers, we both ordered them med. rare, they came out RARE, boxed them up to take home and cook. Finally the dessert we both ordered the Warm chocolate mousse which was suppose to have flourless cake in it, no cake just a bowl of hot chocolate soup, disgusting.. somebody needs to go back to culinary school!! They also only have one restroom for both men and women to share and it was filthy!"}
{"text":"Since there are now an abundance of burger places in the area, we didn't know what to  expect.  What a great surprise!  My husband and I ate here last night and,  my husband who is a \"hamburger aficionado\", was very impressed, as well as myself.  Joey, our server, was great and knew the menu and was able to answer all our questions very professionally.  We built our own burgers and they were delicious.  We ordered a side of onion rings...they were so good we ordered a second one. By the way,  the burgers were delivered with a side of slaw, which was not your usual run of the mill, but very good with a twist...a little bit of spice.  We didn't have room for dessert, but they have a great dessert menu...so check it out.  We only live less than ten minutes away, so having this in our neighborhood is a plus."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went for the first time on Saturday night and we will DEFINITELY be going back! They were very busy so we just sat at the bar so we wouldn't have to wait long. The entire staff was working HARD, it didn't look like any of the servers or bartenders had a minute of down time.

The drink list was extensive. Beers were pricey, but the wine and cocktail prices seemed about average. Now the food. THE FOOD. We started with the crispy calamari, which was thick and perfectly cooked! It came with a gingery Thai inspired sauce which was flavorful but not heavy at all. For entrees, I got the truffle burger and my bf got the Capone burger. Both were very unique and extremely satisfying!!! We also split the waffle fries that were topped with cheese sauce, crab meat, and truffle oil. I'm sure we shaved 5 yrs off our lives, but it was worth it AND I'D DO IT AGAIN."}
{"text":"I just hopped on their website to look at their beer selection.  $8 for a draft of Stone IPA????  Seriously?  I'll pass."}
{"text":"Notorious Burgers was awesome, but I will not be back since they changed their menu to Notorious Kitchen. No more build your own awesome burger with high end ingredients. Now it's a mix of everything I don't want to eat. The cravable burgers have  been replaced with ribs, turkey burgers, salmon sandwich, tacos, just a mix of nothing you would ever crave enough to return for. They were intimidated by new burger places opening which I've tried and are so inferior to what they were doing. I feel sorry for them if they're intimidated by the new \"burgers and fries\" fast food down the street because it's horrible. I will continue to patronize Cuttlefish but never come back to Notorious \"kitchen\". It's just going to turn into a sports bar with an eclectic mix of mediocre ideas. Very sad. My friends will be sad when I tell them. Guess we will try Hopdaddy now. They needed more business, oh well. I will miss them."}
{"text":"Like many people, I enjoy a good burger.  I also enjoy a nicer, more upscale dining experience.  Here, I got both.

The food was great!  I had the truffle burger and my wife had the lamb burger.  The truffle burger was a good balance of the meat and the bacon, and the truffle flavor came through without overpowering everything else.  The lamb burger tasted like the best gyro you've ever had - only better, and on a brioche bun!  Very nice!

The salt, pepper, and vinegar fries were subtle and done well.  I like a stronger vinegar presence, but you can always add more.  Even if you aren't a fan of vinegar (like my wife isn't), these fries were good.  I like the creme fraiche for dipping, too!

The drink menu was beer- and whiskey-focused, which was just fine by me!  A good variety of options in both depth and breadth, particularly in the context of a burger restaurant. 

Overall, I had a great experience, and I'll be back.  Ask for Tracy; he was knowledgeable, engaging, and attentive.  Can't wait to try it again!"}
{"text":"Never had so many unique options to put on a burger! Very exciting concept to choose your toppings and fixings, pair with a draft beer and keep it reasonably priced. A favorite for a classic American regal atmosphere and weekday dinners for the family!

Best to try your hand at a custom burger - 4.25"}
{"text":"I was pretty excited about the menu at Notorious as all of the burgers sounded great, even the quinoa one. The location is great. The restaurant was clean and had a cool vibe to it. A little more upscale than we expected which was nice.

The food was a mixed bag. The burger and onion rings I ordered was pretty tasty. However, there were a few more misses than hits. Fore example, the cheese on the grilled cheese sandwich is actually battered and fried. It comes out very oily and brings down the whole sandwich. Unfortunate because, the other ingredients are good quality. Overall, it seemed like they fried way too many items.

Our server was great. He was nice and had a strong grasp on the menu. They have a nice selection of beers and mine was filled to the brim.

3 stars because the food was a bit too inconsistent for me."}
{"text":"I am stuck between 3 and 4 - I would give Notorious Burgers a 3-3.5 (A-OK or better) and my boyfriend would give it a 4 (yay! he's a fan!). 

I did like the decor entering through the front, but something felt a tiny off in the back main dining room. I can't put my finger on it. Maybe just because it is so dark. 

The waitstaff and manager we SO very nice. They were attentive, kind and really really nice. 5 stars on that. 

The chocolate shake was good, a bit rich. They don't bring you the extra, just the part of shake that fits into the jar. I should have asked for it at the same time as my food, it was a little runny by the time the food came. My fault. 

My boyfriend loved his burger (something with bacon). My cheeseburger was pretty good, nothing life changing, but good. The bun was a little dry - I think that was the biggest drawback. 

The fries were not great at all, they were kind of hard - like overcooked (not burnt, just hard, not crispy, but hard). 

The cheese curds are probably amazing to 99% of people, but since I don't drink or like the taste of beer, I didn't like them as they are beer battered. I bet you for anyone else though, they would just die over these cheese curds. mmmm. 

Overall, our lunch was over $50, which is pretty expensive for just ok/good. 

I am sure I will be back to try again."}
{"text":"The wings were amazing as are most things wrapped in bacon and smothered in BBQ sauce but everything else was mediocre. The Lucky Lucciano Burger was ridiculous. Not the good kind of ridiculous but the kind of ridiculous where if the patty, bun, onion strings, etc had balls, the blue cheese that seemed to be infused to the very being, very soul of this monstrosity would have not only kicked them but would have castrated them as well."}
{"text":"Hands down, excellent food! Hip bar side looking vibe. Nifty lighting on the stools making them a sultry red. Bar flights! Whiskey flights! The beer keg room has a chandelier! 

They carry a porter! The beer menu has an interesting array of stuff to sample from. (I say this without having tried a flight. I was on a business lunch. I sip tasted the Odell Nitro Cutthroat porter. A little watery for my taste.) The flight options are laid out for you. However, I was told if you wanted to try something not listed under the flight beer menu that could be arranged. Neat!

The bar has two large sized televisions allowing anyone in the bar area to enjoy programming. No sound was available during the day. However, I'm not sure if that is standard all hours.

We meandered in slightly before 2pm Saturday for lunch at the bar. There wasn't anyone stool side and two tables finishing up behind us. After ordering Diet Coke's we kind of waited. And waited. But eventually were able to place burger orders.

Sweet Heaven. Goodness Gracious.

Let me smack your lips for you. If we were dating I'd kiss them. The Gambino's Broken Lamb of Leg burger is a *must have*. On top of the artisanal, all-natural lamb patty roasted peppers provided the perfect amount of moisture, balancing out goat cheese, and an over abundance of sunflower sprouts, cucumbers and white balsamic mint syrup. I'd order that again in a heartbeat. 

At this point my Diet Coke ran out. I was in the middle of ravaging the side of spicy slaw that is served with my burger, so I shrugged off my thirst. The slaw is not your average fun of the mill slaw. Protect it from your hungry friends. Put it on the *other* side of your plate. GOOD STUFF.

The battle with thirst was on a slippery slope.

Eighteen minutes later our Diet Cokes were refilled. And our new neighbor who we befriended, in town for the golf tournament, had his beer refilled. I had a taste of the Big Poppa Bacon BBQ Burger. This generous sized burger comes loaded with bacon and cheddar cheese. The kitchen / ordering process has a few kinks to work out. My friend had ordered the onion ring on the side. (It came on the bun.) When I pointed this out the bartender had no comment.

An hour and twenty minutes for a sober lunch is fine if you're not in a hurry. (We were in a hurry.) However, if you're sitting around with empty draft beer glasses. Well..that might be frustrating.

{"text":"Great Service.
If I return, I will Build My Own burger as the ones on the menu had clashing flavors.  If you want medium rare, ask for rare, ours came out medium.
Great Beer Selection."}
{"text":"I only tried a chocolate milkshake here, so I can't vouch for the food.  But I liked the shake!  It came in a mason jar with whipped cream and a cherry on top.  The shake itself was really thick and creamy.

The decor is trendy and classy and the theme is creative - each of their dishes is named after a infamous gangster.  The bar has this brewing/tap room enclosed in glass walls with a cool chandelier that's a pretty neat decorating touch."}
{"text":"Came out for the grand opening friends and family. Great new spot. Should be interesting. Have plenty of great craft beers on tap good food great atmosphere, friendly helpful staff."}
{"text":"Update. The burger joint is gone. A victim of bad service/expensive prices and a basic lack of understanding of the local demographic. The owners have rebranded it as a bbq joint. Not my taste. I wish them well. They also owned the seafood joint next door and that failed too. Now rebranded as a breakfast spot. I wish them well but the kids who run this place are not like their father."}
{"text":"We had an amazing dining experience with myself and my four kids here in Scottsdale on vacation. we know notorious burgers well because we dine at the location in Carlsbad regularly where we live. The burgers were amazing as well as the milkshakes and the french fries and dessert!!!! Tracy was great as well as all of the service we received. The environment is really awesome and overall it was a great experience!!!!"}
{"text":"Burgers don't come with fries.  Several bucks ($4?) extra for those, and the burger prices weren't exactly modest to start with.  Quinoa burger had some of the most uncooked, crunchy black beans in it that I've ever had in a veggie burger.  Our pints of craft beer were $8 each.  With tax & tip, easily a $25 burger/fry/single beer lunch, per person.   Upscale shopping center location is nice, though parking was a bit cramped due to all of the people at the other restaurants such as Pei Wei."}
{"text":"I went to Notorious Burgers after seeing their coupons on several different mailers. I was not sure what to expect, but at the prices for the burgers, I was expecting something good. Unfortunately, this restaurant failed to deliver.

Before I get to the food, I should point out a few things that really detracted from the dining experience. When I went into the restaurant, I noticed it was quite dark. After looking around the floor and seeing how dirty it was with the remains of food and even a spilled drink, I concluded that the lack of lighting is to hide how poorly the establishment is cleaned. There also seemed to be a lack of servers, and the wait time for everything was quite long. Finally, the air conditioning was either not working properly or was set high, as it felt very hot inside and I saw someone at the table in front of me using a makeshift fan.

I ordered a burger using the make your own option. While the burger itself was not bad, the toppings were mediocre at best. I did not like how both the ketchup and mustard were very spicy, and the lettuce and tomato were not appetizing looking at all. 

For the prices that were being charged, even with a coupon, the food should have been better. There is absolutely no excuse for the lack of cleanliness in the restaurant, and it was an uncomfortable experience waiting around a long time for the food. The overall experience was bad, and I will not be returning."}
{"text":"I am definitely a burger fan and this place has great burgers and beers for great prices! I am not even a beer fan but the flights are fun and only $7! You get to build your own burger with many different options or they have options on the menu if you dont trust what you would build. We've been back 2x in the past 2 weeks already and even saw Kurt Warner and his wife dining there last week. The only reason I give them 4 stars and not 5 is because they can do a little bit more work on their french fries and believe their truffle fries should come with the truffle sauce and but a little bit more thin. Otherwise delicious burgers!"}
{"text":"Great location in the gaineys ranch shops next to variety of upscale restaurants. Notorious burgers is located next to cuttlefish and the restaurant is larger than it looks from the outside.

The service and atmosphere is very nice and the selections of burgers are plentiful. I chose to do the build your own burger with a pretzel bun egg and bacon and chipotle peppers. The burger comes with coleslaw and we had the bacon ketchup which was pretty awesome in itself . The chipotle pepper was very spicy so when you first bite into the burger with the chipotle pepper doesn't kick in until a few minutes later. After cutting the burger in half, I had to take out the chipotle pepper on the second half of the burger. The fries were recommended by the waiter but were not as crispy as I like them. We also shared a strawberry shake and it tasted like a malt shake .
I will certainly comeback and try a different burger and bring the rest of my family. Very nice overall and would recommend this place"}
