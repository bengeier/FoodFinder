{"text":"So glad to have fast Mexican food nearby! I recently moved to the area and my one petty complaint was how few dining options surround us. Now just a mile down our street, the former \"Mr. Torta's\" was bought up and converted to \"El Rancho Mexican Grill,\" a second location identical in function to their popular South Park Street restaurant.

My wife and I both got takeout burritos. They tasted fantastic and were ready in a few minutes. It reminds me of Chipotle but without the corporate nonsense. Will be back... again and again..."}
{"text":"The steak tacos are great. Prices are a *little* steep. I'll definitely be back here to try a new item on the menu!"}
{"text":"The quesadillas were excellent and you MUST get them if you go here! I also especially enjoy the homemade guacamole! The tacos were excellent too!

I will admit, though, that the prices are kinda high. At least they are not outrageous, however. And the rice and beans were not the greatest.

Quesadillas and tacos, though, just amazing!"}
{"text":"Just opened on 4/25. They have a location on Park st with a loyal following. 

It's a no frills Mexican joint. Tacos were good and very reasonably priced! Tons of meats and topping options as well. Super friendly staff. 

I heard they eventually will start delivering to the area. 

Looking forward to this being a staple on the Far East side. We need it!"}
{"text":"Solid Mexican food and a sister restaurant to the one on Park Street. Very tasty and quick. The ground beef tacos are very savory. Probably worth splitting with a friend in my case!"}
{"text":"I've been to the El Rancho on Park.  Staring at the menu, just wanting a quick bite for under $7.    OK, the menu does not allow that.   So at Park I got a \"bowl\" with al pastor and the works.   The 'bowl' doesn't really work - - piling all those ingredients in a heap, is not a pretty meal.  Though it did taste considerably good.

Here, at the east side location,  I went for a burrito, and WOW was that the treat.   The formula is simple:  ask the customer what the customer wants in the burrito,  piece by piece, bit by bit - - and if you are a thinking customer, you can cobble together something very satisfying.

Asked for minimal rice (rice, in burritos, folks, can be empty, tasteless filler - - just saying);  then the black beans,  and then the choices of spicy lovely yummy accents that kept rounding out the deal, till it got bigger and bigger,  and finally you get the burrito wrapped up like a juicy, packed, BOMB in silver foil - - loved the spicy onion accent,  the layer of guac,  the succulent al pastor, the pungent bites of jalapeno - - the more you say \"yes\" and round out the burrito, the more of the BOMB it becomes.  (The advantage to a burrito, over a 'bowl', is that the ingredients are packed together, and stay warm, and the flavors start to blend.)

Thoughtful, caring staff;   quality ingredients, I have to say;  and the sum of the assembly is greater than the individual parts.   Best.  Burrito.  Ever.  (but maybe I'm getting old in the tooth).  At least I am still very much happy in the tooth that devours a burrito like this."}
