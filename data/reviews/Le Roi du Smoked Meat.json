{"text":"It has the usual diner food. The food is good but a little pricey. Open late. Salads are good, sandwiches are good. Standard stuff."}
{"text":"Parlez moi d un endroit qui a de l ancienneté , de l expérience Cette endroit est succulente.  Faire l essaye d un smoked meat vaut le détour"}
{"text":"Une petite faim ou une grosse faim, à midi ou à minuit, il y a de la viande fumée à toutes heures et tous les jours chez le Roi du smoked meat!  À déguster sur place dans un décor style USA ou à commander tout est possible et c'est super bon!  Près du métro Beaubien, idéal en after après une bonne soirée, arriver à 3h du mat' et se faire une bonne assiette de viande fumée avec les pickles et tout et tout!"}
{"text":"I love this place!  The service is great and friendly. The food is served in a flash and is always hot and tasty. The smoked meat is excellent and it's my to-go place when I crave it. The restaurant have a vintage feel but it's spotless.  Not the trendiest place, but always a good choice when you want something simple and good."}
{"text":"Smoked meat sandwiches are lacklustre and the poutine is really something to avoid. The gravy is this gelatinous mess that has clumps in it, and the cheese \"curds\" are just chunks of mozzarella. My stomach is feeling rather ill just typing this - I definitely wouldn't be returning."}
{"text":"Entrer chez le Roi du Smoked Meat, c'est tout d'abord s'offrir la chance d'assister à quelques stéréotypes typiques des bruyants diners américains. Il suffit de choisir sa banquette rouge et d'ouvrir grand les oreilles. Pas de jeunes et jolies serveuses par contre. Elles sont pour la plupart âgées, complices, et ne se gênent pas pour partager leur état d'âme à la clientèle. «F*ck  it the bacon Costa!» de s'exclamer l'une d'entre elle, au cuistot affairé avec ses pots de cornichons, sa viande crue et ses plaques brûlantes. Costa, ce cuisinier vétéran, qui n'arrête pas de blaguer haut et fort avec ses comparses, me lorgne de loin et finit par me lancer : « C'est bon mon ami? » Je lui réponds que son smoked meat est très bon. Il rétorque : « C'est sûr, c'est du bon que l'on mange ici! » Effectivement, leur smoked meat fait l'affaire; tendre, juteux, généreux, je l'ai commandé maigre, et malgré cela, il n'entrait pas dans ma bouche. Je n'imagine pas leur « King Size » avec fromage suisse. J'ai un problème avec ce sandwich, peu importe la sélection, il m'est impossible de le terminer uniformément. Quoi qu'il arrive, il se met à perdre sa viande et se noyer dans la moutarde et le jus. À en écouter leur slogan, il s'agit de la meilleure viande fumée en ville depuis 55 ans, mais un slogan, ça vaut bien ce que ça vaut...il est bon, sans plus...  Le restaurant est assez achalandé, ouvert 24 heures sur 24, mais le service n'en demeure pas moins ultra rapide. J'ai reçu mon repas 2 minutes après l'avoir commandé. Le menu ne se content pas que de viande fumée; vous y retrouverez autant de spécialités que de mets traditionnels de la malbouffe maison, allant des poutines bien grasses jusqu'au steak de flétan avec riz et salade. Bière en fût disponible ainsi que deux marques importées (Corona et Heineken). Vins rouges, blancs, rosés disponibles, dont deux bouteilles grecques : le Naoussa Boutari (rouge) et le Kouros (blanc)."}
{"text":"Beaucoup de choix sur le menu, bon service, le smoked meat est excellent. Dans le genre, c'est un endroit très recommandable."}
{"text":"This place is highly underrated...  It is still the authentic diner you remember from your childhood. The place is a timeworn 1950s... probably because they've been sitting around since then while Schwartz and the like got all the love. I know it's weird... St. Hubert? Between the cheap wedding dresses? But yea. right there. They are GOOD. I dare you to do a blind taste test... For the price you get really good quality here.  I alway get this \"take home\" deal of a lb of smoked meat, a loaf of rye bread and 2 sides for 18$... it always lasts a couple days between 2 or 3 of us. Wonderful staff!! Always kind, always laid back, and never fail to make a good impression with out of towners I bring.  I have waited in lines forever at other places and have been much less impressed. The only problem with Le Roi is their sides are not too great. Even the half sours are kinda limp. Great smoked meat though!"}
{"text":"Vous êtes soudainement épris d'une envie irrépressible de vous retrouver au milieu des années 60? Le roi du Smoked Meat vient à votre rescousse ! Banquettes faux cuire rouge, exemplaires du Journal de Montréal à profusion, bocaux de piments dans le vinaigre dans la vitrine. Il s'agit du meilleur endroit à Montréal pour parfaire votre accent québécois avec les serveuses cinquantenaires. Bien sûr on y mange un délicieux smoked meat ... gras ou maigre selon votre condition abdominale ... Authentique."}
{"text":"Wow the Spencer steak was incredible! The meat was very tender with delicious rich flavor. Great prices, great good, excellent service."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for years now and I think the prices are getting ridiculous. When you constantly add a sticker to raise the price of an item because printing new menus take too long... Personally, if the keeps going up and the quality stays the same ( or the decor for that matter) I find enough is enough"}
{"text":"Literally the worst service I have ever had. We decided to mosey on over after the bar, yes it was late and yes we had been drinking but the waitress seemed drunker than we were.. She came back more than a few times to ask what we wanted and she couldn't even look straight ahead. The food was awful, the gravy on my poutine tasted old and the chicken burger was like a frozen Costco patty.. We were four and they brought our food out all at different times. If I could give 0 stars that's what it would have been."}
{"text":"Mellow Yellow Time Travel!  So, Donovan's hit (Mellow Yellow) is playing in the background as my gaze turns from the red, vinyl booths to a killer king-sized smoked meat sandwich that came with pickle, cole slaw, and fries and ... WHOA! I time travel to the 70s! Flashback!!! The servers rock too! They don't get a five-star rating only because the fries were a bit on the limp side, as was the rye.  Shame!  The Roi Special with smoked meat (smoked-meat spaghetti at the next table ... or did I hallucinate that?) looked unbelievably good too! I'm looking forward to getting the Super Special on take-away very very soon!"}
{"text":"Lorsque l'on franchi les portes, on se retrouve dans un décor des années 60 avec l'impression d'être dans un vieux dinner. Le service est à la bonne franquette et le smoked meat pas mal"}
{"text":"Old rock hard re-cooked old french fries... Used to be a good spot, now they try to pass you junk. Service was great and to be fair she did offer to change them.  Was the 3rd (and last) time in a row this happened to me so it's sadly Bye Bye! for me. Never will go there again..."}
{"text":"The food was good, the place is open since the mid 1950's and it seems like time has stop there. The menu is an authentic Quebec dinner style with pies, soups that come with Premium Plus crackers, Jell-o,  fast-food, grill. The beer pitcher costs less then 14,00$. They make their own smoked meat and pickles. You can buy smoked meat briskets to go. I was happy to find on the menu  that they do beef liver and onions because it's not available in a lot of dinners in Montreal. I recommend also the smoked meat and you should ask if you can put your order on a \"table d'hôte\" they will do it. Then you'll get soup, main course, coffee and dessert."}
{"text":"Tous leurs plats avec du smoke meat sont excellents. Vaut le détour. Service rapide et courtois."}
{"text":"They claim to have the best smoked meat in Montreal. Is that the case?   After eating a metric ton of meat and sugar at Cabane à Sucre Au Pied de Cochon hours before, apparently it seemed like a good idea to eat a giant smoked meat sandwich before bed. I wasn't mad at it.   Being a huge fan of pastrami, it was pretty similar to what you'll find at places like Katz's and 2nd Avenue Deli in New York City. A little less fatty, but a nice flavor and stacked quite high. Served to you in a diner atmosphere by women that probably went to elementary school with your grandma, it makes for a fun experience.  As others have pointed out, skip the poutine."}
{"text":"As long as you lower expectations, things should be fine.  Old school diner with a varied menu, generous portions and pretty good prices. They used to stay open very late, but now it's until 2AM (I think)  Hits: Chicken Souvlaki, pizza (thick toppings and lots of cheese), smoked meat (best in area, but not overall in mtl  Misses: Lamb chops, T-Bone Steak  The service is pretty good and they have a takeout special for smoked meat, there's a small park behind the resto with picnic tables for a nice way to enjoy the summer."}
{"text":"I've had Schwartz's (tasty burnt ends, but overhyped) and Dunn's (good overall) on my previous visits to Montreal, and on this visit I planned to try The Main's offering, but while I was out walking/exploring the Petite Italie / Petite Patrie neighborhoods, a friendly local and I struck up a conversation and he strongly recommended the nearby Le Roi du Smoked Meat, so with lunchtime at hand I decided to give it a try. No line-up to get in (in contrast to Schwartz's), a full menu of good-looking food in addition to the signature meat, and it did not disappoint. I ordered it Medium as I tend to do upon first sampling of any Montreal smoked meat, and while it didn't have as many of those yummy \"burnt ends\" that Schwartz's usually provides, I found it overall to be a superior product. Sliced thick and properly, it was tasty and flavorful, and of course plentiful. My new local friend also strongly recommended their Smoked Meat Pizza...and for sure on my next visit I will have to return and try that.  Take a trip off the beaten tourist path to this interesting neighborhood (Beaubien station on the Orange line) and discover this hidden gem, and then walk off your meal along Rue St. Hubert, a shopping strip where it extends for blocks and blocks and blocks covered by glass awnings. And/or: Visit Marche Jean-Talon, the huge outdoor/covered market, which is nearby."}
{"text":"Smoke meat galore.  You need to take the smoke meat sandwich.  Order an extra pickle. Because pickles are great to cut the grease and spices.  Yeah, don't take the extra lean. Medium is required to at least get some taste."}
{"text":"I can't believe people are griping about the service here, it's a freakin' diner not the Four Seasons.  There's need to be some perspective of what type of restaurant you're reviewing.  Having said that, I really enjoyed this place.    It's a neat-o classic looking diner.  Very, very clean with an 80s new wave, art deco appeal.  We had soups and smoked meat sandwiches. Both absolutely fantastic. The smoked meat was simply and tender and delicious.  I know my smoked meat sandwiches and this was a king among kings.  Check it out."}
{"text":"Tried the smoked meat and the poutine via delivery.  The smoked meat was great and was in my opinion superior to Schwartz due to less fat (personal preference), though it was not as well seasoned which would possibly have made Schwartz' better had I ordered lean when I tried from them. Got the super i.e. double meat  The poutine was the first one I have ever liked in my life. I never really understood why people were so in love with soggy fries with gravy and lumps of cheese until I ordered from here. The cheese was layered on top instead of dropped in in chunks and actually amazed me that I liked it since the other versions I have tried were not overly impressive. I now understand the hype!  Delivery was painfully slow but saved me from having to drive so I will take the trade off.  A must try for those who dont want to drive to Schwartz or endure the reported long lines."}
{"text":"Short review:  Smoked meat good.  Poutine bad.  Longer:   Service was swift and as expected in a diner.   The smoked meat sandwich was rich and juicy and wonderful.  The poutine was boring.   Bland gravy and fries that obviously came from the freezer.  Stop in for a sandwich.  Get your poutine somewhere else."}
{"text":"If there was a zero star rating,  that's what I would give this place. Seriously the worst service I've ever  had, hands down. There was 4 of us, it was late at night mind you but we waited forever for our food. The waitress had to be reminded of our orders multiple times and our meals were all served at different times. The food was alright,  nothing special but not horrible.  What was really irritating was when we were almost finished, another couple of people came in that seemed to know the waitress and they were given bread and what not almost as soon as they got seated. We were given nothing while we waited probably over an hour altogether for our meals.  Definitely NEVER going back.  Do NOT recommend."}
{"text":"Plus 10 points pour la déco qui n'a sûrement pas changé d'un poil depuis les années 50, mais moins 5 pour la nourriture qui est pas mal bof. Le smoked meat manque de goût et de texture, et la poutine semble être concoctée avec des frites congelées.   Ce n'est pas très cher, mais ça ne vaut même pas ce qu'ils chargent, quant 'à moi!   Idéal pour les fringales alcoolémiques, car ouvert 24h."}
{"text":"Most people will have you believe that the only smoked meat worth having in Montreal is from Schwartz's Deli, however in my neighborhood most people will gladly tell you that Le Roi Du Smoked Meat is as good if not better than Schwartz's. There is no line out the door, the service staff is not hurried and pressured because of a hungry mob outside smacking their chops and elbowing their way in and best of all the food is excellent. Although I always take our order to go, I rather like the classic 50's diner setting of the restaurant. I took my mother here and she offered to babysit two nights later solely in exchange for another Le Roi Du Smoked Meat sandwich. As she put it, she couldn't stop thinking about her first fabulous Le Roi Du Smoked Meat sandwich."}
{"text":"Another Montréal smoked meat institution. They have nothing on Shwartz and they don't brine their own brisket, but it's still a damn good smoked meat sammich with Cott cherry cola. Never had anything else on the menu. It's all about the brisket."}
{"text":"Voici un bon comptoir de sandwich à la viande fumée situé Plaza Saint-Hubert. La viande est d'une qualité très acceptable, sans être exceptionnelle ou géniale. En général, la bouffe ici est bonne, le service est rapide et courtois. Le menu est un peu trop classique pour ce type de restaurant.   Les deux points forts de l'endroit sont les suivants :  1- Les prix sont abordables, plus que certains autres resto à smoke meat très connus comme Schwatz's, Lester et Reuben. 2- Le décor composé de banquettes rouge vous ramène à la belle époque des diners des années 50.   Vous visiter Montréal pour la première fois ? Vous êtes à la recherche de votre toute première expérience avec la viande fumée ? Mon conseil : ce n'est pas ici que vous trouverez LE sandwich qui fera vibrer vos papilles gustatives. Mais si le temps vous presse et que la faim vous tenaille vraiment, alors prenez place au Roi du SM quand même, mais gardez en tête que la viande fumée a mieux à offrir."}
{"text":"Was  craving  for  a smoke  meat  place... My  boyfriend's father  has  been  speaking to  us  about this  place  for a  while  now  so  we  decided  to  finally  try  it.   We  went  for the  combo.  One  pound  of  smoked  meat  with  1  bread and  choices  of  saladeor fries. For take out.  The  service  was very fast and  friendly..  we  got  out  order  in  no time.  Smoked  meat  was  pretty  good  but not the  best  I have  eaten. the salade  was  pretty good,  but the  fries  were  not good at  all.  Over  all  smoked  meat  was  Okay  but  really  not the  best  place  in  montreal"}
{"text":"I mean, the decoration is cute I guess, it has that 50's feel. For a place that's supposed to be specializing in smoke meat, we found that the bacon pizza was way better than the smoke meat pizza. Don't get me wrong, the bacon pizza was amazing and the creaminess level of the cheese is unparalleled.   It's really hard to find good pizza in Montreal, but this place's bacon pizza is definitely worth to try! Careful though, we were almost overcharged for the pizza and they rectified it but it's always a bummer when you feel like you have to be on guard and checking your bill, instead of  just trusting a place to charge you the right price."}
{"text":"Le Roi Du Smoked Meat est l'un des derniers delicatessen de Montréal. Croyez-le ou non mais les sandwich à cet endroit sont vraiment bon, juteux, gras et chaud.  La décoration est un peu vieux et «cheap» avec des bancs en cuirette rouge et des chansons des années 50-60 mais les prix sont abordables.  Le service est très rapide et courtois. Pour environ 10$, vous pourriez avoir une sandwich à la viande fumée, des frittes, une salade de choux, 1/4 de cornichon et une boisson gazeuse."}
{"text":"i had the Poutine with smoked meat on top - was ok... I was cold and hungry so it filled the spot at the time, but definitely have had better poutine!  I kind of expected the meat to be dispersed through the gravy sauce - but it ended up to be the poutine/gravy/cheese on the bottom with a whole lot of chopped meat on top. Tasty, but could've done with better presentation. I think all up was around $10... Canadian food always seems more expensive!   They're more famous for their smoked meat sandwiches- but I ran out of time to go back and try!   Friendly service - there was no line and maybe an avenue from the Jean Talon station - so worth trying if you can't be bothered going to Schwartz's. But maybe not as much of an \"atmosphere\"."}
{"text":"I had the smoked meat omelet and it was good. nothing mind blowing, but not bad either. Friendly staff! came here to eat before heading to the Grand prix.  The service is pretty good and they have a takeout special for smoked meat, there's a small park behind the resto with picnic tables for a nice way to enjoy the summer.  The place is not bad. they are open quite late so if you are in the neighborhood and have a smoked meat craving and can't wait, the place will do. no lineup or anything as the place is always empty  I will be back again when I'm in Montreal!"}
{"text":"We came by because Schwartz had no power when we got there and they had nothing cooked and ready to go, but you know?  We were pleasantly surprised at how good the smoked meat sandwich was here!  for 11.95 you get an awesome sandwich that rivals the size of Schwartz's sandwich and it's just as good (from my memories 2 years ago).  You have a choice of fatty or lean cuts of \"smoked meat\" and you'll get fries and cole slaw.  Fatty is the way to go though.  So if you're looking to go off the beaten path for smoked meats, you can check this place out.  Caveat though - they may only speak french soooo be patient.  The person seating us was very nice and patient with out being able for us to speak french."}
{"text":"We stopped in for lunch today and the smoked meat sandwiches really hit the spot.  It had an old time diner atmosphere, and the air conditioning was wonderful as it was quite hot. If in the neighbourhood again, I'd come back."}
{"text":"L'ensemble des plats n'ont rien d'exceptionnels mais le poutine à la Roi est la meilleure poutine au smoked meat à Montréal."}
