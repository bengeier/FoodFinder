{"text":"I'm not really big on most if the menu but the salmon chop salad is amazing. I need that recipe!! Who can I bribe...?"}
{"text":"This is one of the most overrated restaurants in town.  People rave about it - then you find out they know nothing about food.  The noise levels in the restaurant are deafening. The food is fine, but nothing special.  The wine list is ridiculously long.  Ask for help w/ the wine list and you'll quickly be directed to some overpriced wines."}
{"text":"Simply the best airport meal I've ever had.  The servers go out of there way to explain every item on the menu to make for the dining experience you've always wanted in an airport.  Not stuffy, anything but.  Super hip and cool atmosphere.  The open faced steak sandwich was delicious.  Blue cheese on potato chips - genius."}
{"text":"Cowboy Ciao has a great selection of American Foods, with the Chopped Salad being a weekly craving of mine.  The wine selection couples well with their menu and the flights are a great way to go if your just stopping in for a night cap."}
{"text":"This used to be one of my favorite restaurants but I had actually not been here in a few years. A friend and I walked in at 8:00 at night and were taken back by an extremely fishy smell. This is shocking as they are not a \"seafood\" restaurant. We both ordered the Chopped Salad which is a huge favorite but neither of us could eat even half of it as the pesto dressing was solid garlic and it covered the taste of everything else on the plate. I could actually taste the garlic all night and next morning no matter how many times I brushed my teeth and gargled with mouthwash!"}
{"text":"Probably the best airport food you may have had. Service is typically good as well. Try the chop salad. Healthy and tasty."}
{"text":"Finally made it over to try one of the newer concepts in the airport! I kept hearing about how awesome it was but I have to say, I don't think it lived up to the hype. The staff was super nice and helpful. The restaurant itself was nice, reminding me of the street side location but the food was nothing too awesome. I will go back and have a try of something else cause I don't want to just write off a place based on something like the West Coast Wrap, which could be a taste preference. I think I'll go and have a try of the mac and cheese and judge it off that cause that'll be a make or break thing for me lol."}
{"text":"Good food, the chop salad is good. Not mind blowing, not life changing as the servers will suggest but good. Impressive that this restaurant has been in buissness nearly 20 years in an industry that doesn't lend itself to longevity,  that being said menu items are not trendy or inventive but honest and simple which is not a bad thing.  But nothing great either.  As we were seated next to the window we were able to witness a comrad of our servers pressing his naked nipple to the glass, which was  frankly hilarious."}
{"text":"This place has good food hands down, the wine list is absolutely ridiculous...Okay wine book I mean. I had the chopped salad, it was good. I didn't like the part where the waitress insisted on smothering it in ranch so I had her keep it to the side. My boyfriend's meat loaf was absolutely delicious. They're cocktails they have listed as \"specials\" werent all that great and the reason why they lost a star is because the waitress kept resting her buttcheeks on my shoulder, like enveloping it and never said excuse me...and she did it a lot."}
{"text":"Arrived early at the airport for once and couldn't get on stand-by...of course...why should I expect travel go smoothly...shame on me.  Normally I am wandering around concourses C or D...but...same old, same old...plus my local Mexican cantina was closed down...so I wander down to concourse B for something different...and I discover Cowboy Ciao...the host was friendly, greeted me right away and seated me right away.  My waitress, Monique, was both friendly and knowledgeable.  She recommended a wonderful, rich, smooth Cab.  I ordered their Puerco Lento (lovely slow roasted pork on the bone dish) with only vegetables...soft, tender, melt in your mouth pork...so surprising to find this in an airport.  Loved it!  The tables were full, littered with business travelers...so it appears to be a well known spot for those of us that live in airports.  If you haven't tried it, don't wait.  Grab a seat, order a nice drink, have a little slice of comfort after a long day...cheers!"}
{"text":"Had the testosterone salad yesterday and it was pretty darn good I'm back again today and had the breakfast enchiladas they were even better I would recommend ordering a side order of flour tortillas with butter to accompany them.  Gave it 5 stars since it is outstanding for airport food."}
{"text":"We've been meaning to check out this place since they made the Rep's Best years ago.  On a whim we decided to stop by for dinner.  The wine selection was so large but the server was able to recommend a wine.  We split the mac & cheez, which was delish!  They we both ordered the espresso-rubbed filet.  My new thing is to try the dish as it was meant to be prepared rather than alter my order and driving the server crazy.  Not a big fan of this one.  You can order the steak without the rub, which I will try next time.  The menu was quite eclectic and next time we are definitely going to try their special mushroom dish (which you can also order in a smaller portion).  The food overall was very rich but the portions were just the right size.  Worth checking out this place.

Quick tip - it's easiest to valet park in that area; otherwise you could potentially be driving around for a while looking for a spot on the street.  Most of the valet guys are going to college, so think of it as a donation to their college fund."}
{"text":"Had breakfast here. 
The food was delicious, and the service was divine.
Thank you TJ! 
We had a wonderful pre-flight meal and TJ had us in a in a great mood while dinning!"}
{"text":"We went here because of the great reviews at yelp, but we were a little underwhelmed.  Both of appetizers we ordered didn't disappoint (scallops and berkshire belly with waffles) but the main dishes were just ok.  The skirt steak was not tender enough (I know it's not a filet, but I've had tender skirt steak elsewhere) and and the puerco lento was just ok.  It's worth going back to try the other things on the menu."}
{"text":"Love this place!  they never disappoint us. Mary Ann at the bar is a true professional and knows her stuff.  She can manage a bar full of patrons and the service bar for the waiters without missing a beat.  If you have not eaten here, its a must do.  The food is wonderful and creative.  The beet risotto with scallops is to die for!  We love Cowboy Ciao!"}
{"text":"Stetson Salad.  If you have never had it, just get it and do it now.  Wow!  Also, love the tuna when they have it on the menu.  It is always cooked to perfection and I am always disappointed when I order tuna elsewhere as it pales in comparison.  I like the decor, it's quirky and whimsical.  Also love the Ciao shots with the lime on top.  Delicious."}
{"text":"Great meal, but just not worth it.
Too expensive, too loud, and very outdated.
There are just too many great restaurants around to make this place worthwhile.  
The interior is well past needing a major renovation. Drab and even a little dirty feeling."}
{"text":"Anytime i have a delay in the PHX airport, I trek over to the B gates to get some Cowboy C.  The stetson salad is very good with a generous portion of salmon, and the open face steak sandwich is steakhouse goodness on a bun.  

The bread pudding is excellent with the right amount of sweet and a surprise bit of heat from some pepper flakes in the sauce.

Definitely ask for TJ if it is your first time in.  He will guide you based upon what you like and wont steer you wrong.  In addition, they can get you in and out quickly if you are pressed for time."}
{"text":"We have been coming here forever. The long bar is a great place to grab a cocktail or glass of wine on a weekend, but the real reason to dine at Cowboy Ciao are two of their signature dishes: The Stetson Salad and The Exotic Mushroom Pan Fry. The salad is mixed table side. Order your own, you will not want to share it. Fresh arugula, plum tomatoes, salmon, corn kernels and couscous, blended with a dressing that will make your mouth happy. Yum, I get hungry just writing about it. The Exotic Mushroom Pan Fry is just as good. It is a mix of shitake, oyster, black trumpet, morel, magic (just kidding), porcini and any other kind of mushroom the kitchen can lay their hands on, swimming in an ancho cream sauce and served over polenta with avocado on top. Double yum! This is a great dish to share or order in the appetizer size."}
{"text":"My boyfriend took me here on our first date, the food was delicious and the service was great. The restaurant is adorable and we have returned about 5 times in the last 6 months. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"AAAAmazing :)  We were in the Phoenix area for a few days and checked yelp to see if any yelpers had found a good place nearby.  They did, and they led me to Cowboy Ciao.  Thanks yelp, you've never steered me wrong!!!

We went for the sharing approach and we ordered a lot, so that we could try different flavors.  Two of us= one salad, one appetizer, two entrees = YUM but stuffed.  

We had the Stetson chopped salad since everyone seems to love it. It really was what people say, amazing. It wasn't a typical chopped salad, it was a mix of very unique but beautifully complementary tastes and textures.  Israeli couscous, smoked salmon or chicken, air dried corn (yummy, sweet, and with a texture that reminds me of astronaut ice cream), currants, and some other things I can't remember mixed together with Buttermilk dressing.  YUM!

Appetizer = steak and eggs.  Very strange, needing \"instructions\" from the waitress, but it was very good.  Essentially some really smokey, good beef jerky, one pickled egg, and some shoestring potatoes, but more like chips.  Alone they taste aok but really interesting and good when eaten together, as advised.

Entrees = a mushroom pan fry which was essentially a really really good mushroom sauce with lots of mushrooms in it (different types) and some polenta. Really good!  I advise that only mushroom lovers order this dish, it is definitely chock FULL of mushroom taste. AND pork chop...amazing with blue cheese inside, a nicely seared chop, yummy figs on top, really good bread pudding. 

Summary: really good mix of flavors, complexity, combinations, etc.  Highly recommend for those looking for new flavors!"}
{"text":"On a receommendation - we went to CC...was told that the chopped salad is to DIE for!  No joke - get this salad.   It is the best.  People that don't even eat salad eat this.

I also had the mushroom and the crab.  Crab needed some acid and the mushroom was great - except where were the cool mushrooms.  They listed lobster, black trumpet, yellow foot, etc...and all I ate were portobello and button.  Nothing wrong with that, but if those other shrooms are really not going to be in there, then don't list it and I'll eat something else.  Dessert was ok as well.  Their shining star - for sure that dang salad!

Our server was awesome too - loved her!"}
{"text":"I had lunch there on Tuesday, I was a little disappointed with the WBTG list. I found a nice Cab and ordered the steak sandwich, which the bartender said was a very good choice. My lunch came out quickly and the presentation looked great, the steak itself was very good but the potato chips were stale and very little cheese on them. Now here is where my experience turned south- A cock roach started crawling across the bar towards my plate, I tried to get the bartender's attention without too much noise, finally the other server speaking to him heard me. He came over killed the cock roach like it was an everyday occurence and walked away and never said another word about it. No one else approached me about it nor was any adjustment made to my bill. 
I had heard so many wonderful comments regarding this establishment but, between the cock roach and the apathy of the staff I will not return."}
{"text":"Every time we go to Cowboy Ciao, I vow to get something besides the exotic mushroom pan fry and the Stetson salad. And every time we go, I break my vow. Except for the one time I got the ultra ham and cheese, which although very good, was not worth getting again. Which is why I keep breaking my vow.

The service is amazing; attentive without being annoying. We love the atmosphere, too. We usually luck out and get a spot in the front by the window with a view of the fountains across the street.

Highly recommended. Be sure to make a reservation to avoid potentially LONG wait times."}
{"text":"I was at the airport this past Sunday I asked the prospect cart driver to direct me to a nice place to dine in he took me on over to cowboy ciao I was greeted felt welcomed enjoyed my dinner Liz was my server she was out standing but I couldn't help but to notice the manger watching the football game on he never moved restaurant was extremely busy but he was so disengaged then towards the end of my dining experience he sat down at the end of the bar to have dinner"}
{"text":"Such a delicious dinner!
We started with the brisket app, then shared the pork, the salad and the scallops app and all were insanely good. Perfectly cooked, great flavor combinations, the salad tossed at the table. They also have a very extensive wine list and blue cheese olives for your dirty martini ;)
Delicious"}
{"text":"Impressive wine list, but the service was a little apathetic, and very high prices for the quality of food.   Food was lukewarm when it arrived and the \"menu description\" to \"product\" ratio was pretty far off.  I essentially had a BBQ-sauced ham hock over far too buttery grits.  But I will say that the wild board meatballs were awesome.

I think I just expected more."}
{"text":"The atmosphere of the restaurant was great.  I have to agree with some of the other posts that it seemed that we were an inconvenience to the waiter and took a long time between ordering and getting our food.  We were there a total of 3 hours,  and most of that was waiting.  The food was Ok. I had the spare rib.  It was a little dry and the portion was a bit small for the price. The best part of the meal was the bread pudding dessert, it was fantastic.  Overall,  it was not a bad place,  but not sure I would return with choices that taste better for less money."}
{"text":"I just had the best hamburger of my entire life. If I lived in Phoenix I would drive to the airport just to eat here.  Great staff, great food I have to tell you I wish my flight were another hour later. Elizabeth T. Could not have been more pleasant. I will be back but not soon enough."}
{"text":"We had a long flight from the east coast and a long layover at the airport. Time for a comfortable and filling meal. The quesadilla  del dia  and truffles macaroni and cheese were straightforward, filling and tasted good. A cold bottle of beer helped as well. The waiter was very tuned in and efficient. The room was close quarters and a bit warm--it was 107 outside. The menu was only two pages which can be a good thing. Lots of wines to choose from. Dining room was fairly quiet."}
{"text":"I went to Cowboy Ciao for my birthday dinner this past Saturday. I chose that restaurant so I could have their lamb dish. When we arrived, we were advised that the menu changed 24 hours before we arrived. And sadly, my lamb dish had been changed. I was .  When I asked if they could make an exception for my birthday, I was told no as they did not have the ingredients (the waitress didn't even ask...she just said no). 

I ended up having the filet mignon, which was tasty. My husband and I shared the Stetson Chopped, one of my favorite things on the menu.  He had the pork chop, which he enjoyed (although his potatoes had no flavor).  All in all, the food was fine although not as good as previous menus. 

I must say that I was disappointed with the service. It was my birthday, which I noted in my reservation on Open Table and I mentioned to our waitress. She said nothing. Not a single recognition....not even a Happy Birthday. That seems like an easy way to give impressive service."}
{"text":"I love Cowboy Ciao!  We go out of our way to eat there many times during our 7 months spent in AZ.  The chop salad is unlike anything you can find elsewhere and is the major reason we frequent the place.  We have been patrons now for 14 years and will definitely keep coming back!"}
{"text":"ordered the pork lucero, and ate the whole thing to the bone"}
{"text":"Breakfast Enchiladas were beyond delicious. Presentation was 5 star, and flavor backed it up. I will make dining here part of my regular airport experience. Definitely not what you expect for \"airport food\". Great job!

BTW - The service matched the food!"}
{"text":"My sister and I had dinner here last Monday night for the first time. It won't be our last. We were greeted with smiling faces and were seated right away. Our server, Mark, 
was very attentive and very knowledgeable about the menu. He suggested we start with the Stetson chopped salad, which we split. I have to say that it was probably one of the better salads that I've ever had!

We decided to try the pastrami style smoked short ribs which Mark said was big enough for us to split. It was plenty. The meat was excellent. The dijon mashed potatoes and brussels sprouts were very good. After all this we were fairly sated, but since it was my sisters birthday Mark suggested that we try a piece of their lemon birthday cake. This was almost overkill but we did eat it, (groan) and it was very good also.

It was a great evening with an excellent meal and as I said earlier this won't be our last time here."}
{"text":"Rockin.  So many reviews on this one, just putting my four stars in there.   

Great wine selection, great food, great fun."}
{"text":"Just went again after a 3 mo absence....holy crap the quesadillas are phenominal!! To top it off the bartenders are even better- can't believe they remember me!!! I must have left a terrible impression.  In all seriousness this is the best airport bar/restaurant and I credit that to the service and secondly the food. And I love the food!"}
{"text":"I give this place to start is a 1 at most I was really disappointed basically lot of corn and hominy on your plate for large dollar amount, ordered tiger prawns basically they lie on their menu they're not tiger prawns they were Mexican gulf shrimp tiny tasteless :( manager didn't care didn't show any concern That they're serving a totally different species and saying something different on the menu wow"}
{"text":"I spend a lot of time in airports, but i think this may be one of the few trips i've been in Phoenix airport long enough to need to sit and eat a meail. Luckily the Cowboy Ciao restaurant was close to my terminal. It's  cute, nice music, nice ambiance. I'm stuck between 3 or 4 stars, but there's more factors pushing me to 3 than 4 so far,....
  The hostess who greeted me was very sweet, and for any business traveler used to being scoffed at, when asking for a seat by an outlet, this was a refreshing change. the entire bench seating of about 7 tables, has one outlet per table on the bench seat 
  The waitress was less than friendly, and for some reason reccomended bottled water because she won't drink the tap water here ..... I drink tap water even in most latin american countries over my last 10 years of travel, so maybe she's just looking for a higher check charge - therefore higher tip?
     Anyway, it's cute, clean. Food came quick. Although it appears they're going for a guormet spot to replace a reportedly horrible place (according to the story on the menu). for example on a layover i'm not usually going to splurge $17.50 for a basic salid nor $17.50 for a steak sandwich as i eathalf while running to board a plane....
   i did find a decent compromise on the \"Truffled 'Mac n' Cheese'\" appetizer. It's not the best new spin on mac n' cheese, i've had in the last few years, but it's good. Very decent size for a $7.50 appetizer,
  Wine by the glass list isn't too bad either - which for ME personally, can make a or break a place LOL :)

  Anyway, overall i'd probably give 3.5 Stars, but i'm still here....so let's see how this story ends :)"}
{"text":"Two words: Stetson Chopped! You have to try it, I get it every time!  Extensive wine list, upscale decor that is perfect for date night or an evening out with friends, excellent service.  Everything on the menu is incredible.  The birthday cake is a different flavor everyday.  My only complaint: no chocolate dessert to indulge in after dinner.  One of my favorite places to dine!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious food.  Excellent VEEV cocktails to begin. Mari the bartender shook up a VEEV cocktail with Casis and muddled berries and mint.  WOW. Stetson salad is out of this world and the pastrami braised short rib is completely insane. Like candy.   Still thinking about it!   Our waiter Mark was so attentive and gave us the best suggestions of what to order.  Really wish there was a restaurant like that in LA.  Congrats Cowboy Ciao!"}
{"text":"So good I amost skipped the place due to it's stupid name.   Definitely eat here for airport food it's da best!"}
{"text":"I ordered the NY and the mushroom dish and shared them with my wife and they were pretty tasty.  They have a very extensive list of wines but when I ordered a bottle of 2010 Vineyard 29 Cru and they said it was out. The manager recommended a bottle of 2010 Vice Versa Le Petit Vice and it was quite good. The service was good and the atmosphere was great. I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Breakfast customer. Not busy - one other customer at the start, almost a dozen when we left.

First moments: I asked for a Gluten-Free menu due to my wife's allergy (Celiac), the host/waiter literally laughed and said \"no\". We then went through the menu and the waiter was \"kind\" enough to explain how some things are prepared. We were able to figure out how to accommodate my wife.

Another member of my party is lactose intolerant...asking for non-dairy creamer and again, another response of \"no, only milk or half/half\".

The food arrived and it was reported that one of our party's meal was \"forgot\"...and \"...they were starting it right now.\" I was 3/4 done with my food when his came out of the kitchen. 

 The server eventually became attentive and respectful towards the end of the experience. He then offered to let us hang out in our seats to be more comfortable than in the airport loun

The food we did order was good by all members of our party (5). The service and accommodations are simple fixes."}
{"text":"I dined here about a year ago and remember enjoying a 5 star quality meal. That is why today I welcomed a 2 hour layover around dinner time so I could go to cowboy ciao for a delicious open face steak sandwich.  

I walked from a17, which is about a 10 minute walk, but not a problem when I know what delicious food lies ahead.  After waiting about 10 minutes for a table I was seated and promptly ordered. 

When my food came it was nothing like I remember. The steak itself was hardly warm, like it had been sitting out for 5 minutes waiting to be delivered. The demi glaze was virtually non-existent and the ciabatta was bordering the heel and challenging to cut through. It was lacking. For $18 I expect it to be pretty tasty. 

After delivering the sandwich my server never returned to the table to check on me or even refill my water glass until she brought the bill. If she had come by I probably would have mentioned the temperature.   

Overall, it was not that bad, especially by airport standards.  The experience was just so much less stellar than I remember, and the poor service bumped it from a 3 to a 2. 

Cowboy ciao you can do better than this. Make me want to give you another shot."}
{"text":"Food was excellent.  Incredibly overshadowed by dis engaged service.  Not rude. Just clueless.  We visited on 3/11/14 for a 6pm dinner.  Arrived 15 minutes early and promptly seated.  Good so far (or so we thought as we later got a no show nasty gram as the hostess didn't actually check us in under our reservation.). We decided to order some cocktails and do a graze option of the small plates for dinner.  When we inquired about the ingredients in one of the cocktails, she responded with a comparison to another type of drink we had never heard of.  We asked for further clarity and got a blank stare.  We then asked about the ingredients in the famed chopped salad and got a hushed mumbled reply.  (Still wondering what she said!). Ended up ordering barrata salad and mini mushrooms app to start.  Said we would then graze on the scallops and prawns and order some wine with that.  Ten minutes later, everything showed up at our table.  All at once.  Cocktails, apps, grazing dishes!  (And no extra plates?????). We would think that a place like this would get the concept of pacing a meal.  Instead, we were stuck having pre dinner cocktails, apps, and entrees all on our table at once!  AND we hadn't ordered our wine yet!  Start to finish, dinner would have taken less time than a visit to a burger joint if we had consumed at the pace they served!

The food was excellent.  Nice portions with plenty to share.  Too bad temp suffered on the dishes from sitting given how they were all dropped at the table simultaneously.  Wine list was likely good had we had some time to consider an appropriate pairing.  Cocktails were tasty and creative (as mid and post dinner).  Service was lacking in attentiveness and just plain basics for a restaurant like this.  They could do so much better!"}
{"text":"The food is always amazing. The best chopped salad on the planet!  The meat main entree was superb amd the dessert was matchless - stawberry gelato, cookie tower. The service and atmosphere  are always a treat too. A must visit when in Phoenix and Scottsdale area."}
{"text":"Cowboy Ciao is one of my favorite Scottsdale restaurants. I have been visiting here since moving to town ten years ago and I can't think of a time I have been disappointed.

The food has always been quite enjoyable and service is always on point. The atmosphere is comfortable and not the standard thing you find at chain style restaurants.

Definitely one of the few spots that are on my short list of favorite restaurants in town."}
{"text":"We were excited to visit Cowboy Ciao last Friday night for a business function which turned into the worst experience of our lives in a restaurant.  I can get over the fact that our entrees took well over an hour to arrive and one of them had a long, blonde hair on the plate to boot.  What I will never get over is how I was treated by the manager after choking on the short ribs at the table - one of the most terrifying experiences of my life.  I'm not sure exactly why this happened; perhaps, because my entree was cooked on the same grill as shellfish, which I'm allergic to.  I started choking and literally threw up at the table in front of my friends and clients and nobody came to help; offer a napkin, glass of water, anything!  (However, I will give the waiter credit for bringing me a mint 15 minutes later.  Lost points though for adding in an auto gratuity for subpar service).  The only time the manager stepped up was 10 minutes later by yelling at our wives for being in the men's room stall with me because I was having a hard time breathing.  And then he had the gall to insinuate that I was drunk.

I spend about $40k/year entertaining clients in restaurants and our tab this night was $700 (which I was picking up).  You can bet your ass that I will never set foot in this place again and I will be sure all my business contacts do the same.  The manager should be fired because for being a total disgrace and sorry excuse for a human being."}
{"text":"I came here with my husband and 3 other good friends while making our cross country move to San Diego. All of us were visiting one friend who lives in Phoenix and I am so glad we came here!
I literally crave the food we had here at times and will come any time I visit my friend in Phoenix! 
Their chopped salad....get it. I could have easily eaten the entire giant plate of it and been content but am glad I didn't pass up my meal.
We also ordered the Pork Belly & Waffles...salty, sweet...the apples and the syrup...wow. So good.
I got one of their specials of the night, a Guiness ribeye which was absolutely delicious, awesome flavor. It was pretty fatty...ok...really fatty...even for a rib eye, and I enjoy fatty steaks but this was pretty bad. Our server saw this, apologized and even brought out free dessert for the table!!! It was an ice cream sampler....I seriously have never had more delicious ice cream since. The goat cheese ice cream...to die for. Maple bacon ice cream...delicious!!! 
As you can guess, the service was amazing, our server was funny, attentive but not bothersome, and our food and drinks came out in great times. 
My husband got a salmon dish which he devoured and was very happy with. Everyone at our table enjoyed their food as well.
The atmosphere was great, bathrooms were clean.
I love this place, will definitely come back!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is delightful.  Service and ambiance are excellent and the chopped salad is a personal favorite.  My wife and I often go there and share the Birthday Cake for desert - it is always on the menu and always delicious.  We have never had a bad experience."}
{"text":"I was in Scottsdale this past weekend for a little R&R before attending a conference at the Hyatt at Gainey Ranch.  My friend and I went out to Old Town for dinner one night without any reservations- - we wanted to walk around an see what looked good.   We found ourselves at Cowboy Ciao for dinner.  We only waited about 20 minutes (sat at the bar) before a table opened up.  While we were at the bar, the bartender (a woman, I did not catch her name), was very friendly. 

We were given a table for dinner pretty quickly.  First, the service during dinner was top notch.  Our waiter helped us select a great wine from their huge wine list.  We told him what we liked \"white, not too sweet\" and our price range, and he gave us a great recommendations.   On to the food-

We didn't try any appetizers because we were determined to make it to the dessert round, based upon the delicious sounding desserts on the menu.   I really liked the fact that the menu had about 8-10 solid entree choices (in addition to a ton of small plates, salads, etc.) - - not too big, not too small.  When I see a restaurant trying to be \"all things to all people\" with a huge menu, I always wonder how many of the ingredients are actually fresh as opposed to frozen.  While I certainly wasn't in the kitchen, I can say that both of our meals tasted fresh.  

I ordered a slow cooked pork shank which fell off the bone with a fork.  It was freaking amazing!  It came with these fingerling potatoes in a garlic cream sauce that was out of this world.  Nice big portion of food, too.  My friend ordered a swordfish steak with a light cream sauce and vegetables.  I tried a bite and it was really good - the sauce was light and did not over power the fish.  Overall, 2 delicious meals.  

Onto dessert - - despite our efforts to save room for dessert, I found myself starring down the dessert round with a very full belly of pork and potatoes.  But alas, we are not ones who give up easily.  We ordered the chocolate bread pudding to share.  It came with some smokey chocolate ice cream.   I wasn't the biggest fan of the smokey chocolate ice cream, as I am not a \"smokey\" flavor person.  But my friend liked it and it was on the side so it did not stop me from diving into the chocolate bread pudding, which was really, really, really good.  

Overall, I would definitely come back here if I find myself in Scottsdale again.  We had a great meal."}
{"text":"I have sat at the bar hear numerous times and have gotten great service. Twice I have been seated at arable and have had terrible service and once told I needed to have at least three in my party to sit at a table.
The same man and women have provided poor service and were unprofessional both times."}
{"text":"I pride myself on being 'that girl' that tries out every restaurant I come across. It's practically a hobby for me. For YEARS I kept saying, \"I want to go to Cowboy Ciao\" but we never made it. Then, thankfully, the hubs' best friend had a big birthday dinner there, so we just HAD to go. (Thank you hubs' best friend!)

I have to say that the service was incredible, and the menu was almost overwhelming. There were SO many interesting choices, but I had to stick to the tried and true chopped salad - everyone and their mother has told me about this salad, and I wasn't about to miss out. The hubs ordered the Tenderbelly Pork Shank. 

The chopped salad has earned its reputation. That thing is de-freaking-licious. The Pork Shank dish was fabulous as well, but I couldn't get over how great the salad was! AND the server always came over to make sure that my wine glass was never empty. Seriously, can it get any better?

For dessert we ordered the spumoni- I have had better (no offense) but I'm not sure anything served after that salad would have made me happy :)

I'm very glad we finally made it to Cowboy Ciao and I look forward to going back - SOON!"}
{"text":"Can I just say THE best service at the bar.  The servers are QUICK, attentive and so very nice.  Anticipate your every need.  Food is 3-4 stars but service is 5 stars.  Made my flight delay tolerable."}
{"text":"Good but not great. We shared the chopped salad which was really, really good. They don't describe it on the menu but we ordered it based on all the other Yelp reviews and were not disappointed even though we probably would not have ordered it if we knew ahead of time what was in it. We also shared the fillet mignon which was cooked perfectly and they split it for us at no extra charge. The wine list by the glass was not acceptable and the glass of chardonnay that my husband ordered was room temperature. The waitress asked if he wanted some ice when he complained! He sent it back and ordered a diet coke which pretty much ruined what could have been an exceptional meal."}
{"text":"Came here for our annual Holiday Dinner and was not disappointed. I've lived in the valley a long time and have had drinks at the water hole next door more times that I can remember but for some reason have over looked Cowboy Ciao...better late than never.

I had the lamb and wow...it was cooked to perfection. It melted in my mouth. I ate every morsel on my plate and could have probably eaten more. Thank god for portion control! It was served with couscous or something similar which made for the perfect accompaniment. For dessert we shared bread pudding - now who doesn't appreciate a good bread pudding? I mean what could be better than ooey gooey bread and custard with fresh cream. I was in heaven!

Our server was great and very helpful. I'm allergic to nuts and sometimes eating out can be a rather nightmarish experience but not at Cowboy Ciao. Our server took the time to check with the kitchen on all our dishes to insure my safety. Thank you Cowboy Ciao!"}
{"text":"So I used to be amazed with this place.  An awesome breakfast in an airport!   Not any more.  Bartender just told me they used to do that (baste my eggs) but they don't anymore,  they got to busy.   Got busy cuz the food was good and prepared to order.  I have to wonder, if they don't do that anymore, will it stay busy?  I recommend you find somewhere else to eat."}
{"text":"For airport food, this is pretty good. I had a 3-hour layover in Phoenix and wanted to actually sit down and eat rather than just grab a premade sandwich or salad and eat at my gate. 

I got the West Coast Wrap (chicken, tomatoes, avocado, lettuce, pickled onion) which also came with homemade potato chips. The wrap was good, really good combo of flavors and textures. The chips were not good though, they literally had no flavor. Now I admit I'm not a big chip fan in general but I know good ones when I taste them. These had no flavor and no salt. Good crunch but after trying one I didn't eat any more. 

Service was good (I sat at the bar). Overall it was a good choice for airport food but nothing outstanding."}
{"text":"I had been here once for dinner back in early 2000's .. not exactly sure when. I don't even remember what I ate but I do remember it all being very good and I had intended to come back.  

Finally, I returned today, meeting some friends for brunch.  I had the Breakfast Enchiladas.  They were pretty good. I like spicy but not hot and the salsa worked for me.  However, the waitress didn't ask me how I wanted my eggs and I had kind of forgotten they came with eggs... I like mine over easy and these were not.  Also, I didn't really taste any chorizo.  But the flavors were otherwise good.

My only complaint is the service.  The waitress was dressed as if she should have been out clubbing.  She wasn't very professional as she was only able to handle two plates at a time.  My food wasn't as hot as it should have been.  She also knocked down a drink on the table and even though she cleaned it up she didn't apologize or check to make sure the liquid hadn't gotten on us."}
{"text":"We ordered wine and scallops apptz plus the tiger prawn shrimp appetizer , which I was very excited about being from Seattle , what we got was disappointing ! It was gulf shrimp small and tasteless ? I felt I was lied too, by menu description thinking I was ordering a totally different expensive tiger prawn species of shrimp ! Like being told your getting lobster but they serve you langoustine ! Total disappointment ! We left without even ordering dinner !! Felt like cattle being run through."}
{"text":"This is our first time to Scottsdale. Yelp reviews didn't disappoint at Cowboy Ciao. The Stetson Chopped salad with avocado was tasty and just the right size for lunch. The pepitas gave the salad the perfect crunch. My mom had the mushroom plate with polenta. She loved it. Both were great meals whether you're a carnivore or vegetarian. I don't usually have dessert at lunch, but I have to admit I went to Cowboy Ciao for the peach bread pudding. It was made with biscuits and was amazing."}
{"text":"Cowboy Ciao.. What can I say? Absolutely amazing! If you haven't had a chance to dine here make a reservation immediately. Ciao is by far one of the best most consistent restaurants that one can find. I was in an indecisive mood so I asked to do chefs choice for food and wine pairings. Rich paired 5 courses with multiple wines and knocked them all out of the park! The chopped salad with brut rose champagne was incredible. Sencere and Gewurtztraminer with the trout were both fantastic.  The Coudolet Beaucastel blanc and the porc belly made my evening probably my month! The flat iron steak was cooked to perfection and melted in my mouth. The Malbec that accompanied the dish was beautiful with ripe fruit an earthy backbone. The whole meal was exceptional. Great food great service great ambiance, Ciao  exceeds expectations at every turn. A true gem in the Phoenix dining scene. And don't sleep on the wine list! If you want any suggestions just ask Rich he really knows his stuff."}
{"text":"Great service, super sweet wine list. The chopped salad is amazing, mushroom pan fry is to die for, mac and cheese perfect. Been here a few times and we are still working our way thru the menu. Great place for dinner for 2 or a big group. Everyone we bring here loves it!"}
{"text":"Sat us quickly. I'm eyeing the Elvis' has chocolate chip pancakes. It's Mother's Day. The chocolate chip pancakes were to die for, and so was the burratta and grilled peaches salad. I am definitely going back there. The only downside was the interior decorating was very strange."}
{"text":"For a restaurant that touts to have the largest wine list in Phoenix and carries Fernet Branca to boot, I am alarmed to learn that they no longer stock Drambuie. 

The consequence? No ordering a Rusty Nail to go with those awesome mushrooms. Much less any other drink that requires this apparently elusive liqueur.

Also off the list:

Bonny Prince
Cumulus
Kiltlifter
Loch Lomond
Warm Wooly Sheep

Bon appetit and but no bottoms up."}
{"text":"The Stetson Chopped Salad with chicken is fantastic.  Located in Terminal B across from B21."}
{"text":"My wife & I went here for our 3rd anniversary dinner. Bottom line is the food was excellent & the server did a great job, but they mashed us into this tiny table with absolutely no room to move. My chair was pushed all the way into the table & the back of it was still hitting the chair of the person behind me. My wife's chair was up to the table, & she hit the wall behind her every time she pushed away from the table. Very disappointed by that. When you chose a nice restaurant to eat at, you should expect a little elbow room. If we ever go back, I'll be sure to demand a table with some space."}
{"text":"Got stuck at PHX on a 6 hour layover. Had some great local brews and tasty sandwich. 
Made the layover worth while. 
Thanks CC."}
{"text":"Had an hour layover in Phoenix and decided to give this place a shot. Not only was the food/drinks phenomenal, but the service (Ty was my bartender) was even better. A bit pricy, but you're definitely getting what you pay for! I'll 100% come back if I ever happen to be in this airport again."}
{"text":"Excellent chopped salad...really unique blend of ingredients.  Another person at the table said burger was one of the best he's had.  Didn't taste like airport food and very fast service."}
{"text":"What a GREAT surprise. And, in an airport of all places. 
I had lunch in NY, then, was fed in first class on the plane to Phoenix for my connecting flight. I was full. 
But, my next flight was late so I stopped in Cowboy Ciao just to have a nice spot to sit. I saw the food coming out of the kitchen and couldn't resist, even though I was not at all hungry. 
TJ the server is really friendly, answered various questions about dishes happily. That alone was refreshing Then, the food arrived. So good. 
Then that corn bread desert. I ate my way through desert shops in NYC and this was right up there with them.
\"Disgustingly too good.\""}
{"text":"Some delicious dishes at this place, but very uneven.  Start with the Stetson Chopped Salad, which is delicious.  But steer clear of the mushroom dishes.  They all sound delicious to me and everyone else I bring to Cowboy Ciao.  The restaurant itself is sure proud of them.  But they come out in a goopy sauce that steals the show, leaving the mushrooms as afterthoughts.  I now know why -- after sitting at the bar and watching the kitchen, the murshrooms come out of an enormous pot better suited for a prison kitchen than a restaurant like this.

Ok, I'm being too negative -- this restaurant has a lot going for it, but it's too uneven to really deserve the fourth star."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner and were very impressed.  First of all, everyone we asked recommended this place, so let me add my part by saying this, 'highly recommend this place'.  It does get busy at night but the place still retains its coziness and trendiness.  Now that you're here, remember, stetson salad!  No really, it's a must!
Besides the salad, we had the duck and flat iron steak, both were delicious and tingled our taste buds in different ways.
Our waiter was excellent, very efficient, never forgot about us, would check up on us at exactly the right times, tossed out salad, brought out the dishes in exactly the right order (unlike some places that just bring them out as they come, or worse, and then you end up with your appetizer after you're done with your steak...)
Overall, great food, great service, great vibe so I place high marks!"}
{"text":"4.5 stars. It's pricey and has some room for improvement, but this is quite easily my  favorite place for date night to get a consistently high quality dining experience. Great place to take out of town visitors as well.  Southwestern vibe and flavorings mixed in with ultra hip grub.  Wine flights are always a good choice. They know their wine pairings and have an enormous wine selection. Been there for dinner countless times and Sunday brunch two times including today.  I've tried to replicate the Stetson salad and get pretty close, but they have the perfect balance of ingredients that I still get it pretty much every time I'm there for dinner. I wish it were a little cheaper. If so, I'd go there more often. I like that the complex has self-parking (it's hard to find, but there is a huge underground garage; so if you don't want to valet you don't have to). A lot of places like this around town have gone to all valet which seriously upsets me and automatically drops my rating by 1 star. Over the last 15 years the price has gone up and the portions smaller, but that's the way of the world and they don't really need my business. The place does very well.  Make a reservation!"}
{"text":"In all my years in AZ, I've failed to visit cowboy Caio. I figured it was about time to give it a try. I would say that I would come back, for sure, but I felt it was all good not great. The famous chop salad was good. Presentation was awesome. The ahi tuna was avg, but admittedly I'm not, a huge fan of jerk seasoning so maybe my fault for ordering. I just really felt like tuna! Drinks were good, service was good, ambiance is very nice. Had a bite of my dates pork chop and it was very good - Cooked rightl and flavorful. 
 Nothing bad by any means, just not really \"wowed\". Overall an above average experience."}
{"text":"Meh, interesting fusion of foods but the beef needs work. Cocktails are eclectic. 

Its ok, not for everyones taste. 
  
Service was good. Of the options around the area, I wouldn't make it my first pick."}
{"text":"Solid dining experience all around. Apps were great--mushroom fry and bread-cheesy dip thing. I had the duck-duck-goose.  Duck meatloaf was a little strange, enjoyable but perhaps not the best use of duck. I love foie gras, so that was fantastic. J had the elk....very heavy. M had the salmon--so yummy. E had the stetson salad...a little small for a meal but fantastic.  Cuppa hot chocolate was great as recommended...loved the spiciness. Brownie cheesecake was good but didn't blow my mind, but the pistacho ice cream was mmmm...."}
{"text":"We decided to try Cowboy Ciao for lunch and all I can really say is it was interesting but nothing spectacular. While we didn't dive into the wine list to kick off an early day of day drinking, I was pleased with the unique variety of non-alcoholic drinks including spiced ginger-ale, real Dr. Pepper (sugar cane), and other kinds of non-standard liquid refreshment. The Ahi Tuna sandwich was quite good but slightly skimpy on the tuna and the bread on my wife's sandwich honestly had the characteristics of being micro-waved. Table service was rather lack luster and not terribly impressive, our waiter seemed more like a wind up toy just going thru the motions. While I was disappointed, I do think that they are aspiring to a certain culinary excellence, as you would expect in Scottsdale where within 200 yards of this restaurant you can find a flood of exotic ingredients with fish and even burgers made of Buffalo and Ostrich thus I will plan on trying Cowboy Ciao again perhaps dinner will be the key."}
{"text":"I spent last Saturday in Scottsdale and ate dinner at Cowboy Ciao. It's in Old Town pretty much right across the street from the steps leading to South Bridge. I have eaten at Cowboy Ciao a couple times in the past and I was looking forward to returning. 

Cowboy Ciao kind of rocks the \"Rustic Minimalist\" approach combined with a touch of artiness. I don't mean that in a bad way, because it works well and is a nice change from so many Scottsdale eateries that ooze pretense. Some of the walls have murals on them that add a splash of color to the decor. The bar is in the center of the restaurant and the bar top is large, angular, and beefy. The restaurant seating and the tables are \"plain Jane\" for the most part. The one exception is a booth that is raised up on a small, decorated platform. Overall, the place has a warm feel to it. Noise levels in the restaurant can be elevated at times, but I never found it hard to carry on a conversation. 

If you are a wine fan, you will find Ciao's wine list both a blessing and a curse. The blessing is that they source their wines from Kazmierz (same owner), so there is something for every price range and palate. The curse is that the wine list is H-U-G-E and it's not in a user-friendly format. Instead of being by varietal, then by winemaker or price, their list set up by wine color, then price. When there are 20 wines, it's no issue. When there are 2,000 wines, well now you have to start digging. 

I wanted to order a half bottle of chardonnay, so that meant turning to the Whites section (mind you, it's the size of a phone book) and then looking page after page for what I wanted. Yes, I probably could have asked, but I'm a self-proclaimed wine snob and asking would ruin the treat of picking out something yummy myself. I finally bailed on the half bottle idea and looked to the wines by the glass list, which by comparison to the bottle list was very small and there were no Chardonnays I liked, so I ended up getting a glass of Kunin Grenache. It was reasonably priced ($11) for the quality of the wine and was very good. Earthy, fruity, and very well rounded for a Grenache. 

OK, onto the food. Cowboy Ciao's menu is best summed up as being eclectic. Now in my foodie experience, there is eclectic food that is just weird and then there is eclectic food that makes you say, \"I'd never think of combining all that, but damn that's good\". Ciao is definitely in the latter group. They have a nice selection of both small and large plate offerings. We ordered a variety of small plates to share. 

Here is a rundown of the items in the order we ate them:

Stetson Chopped - This is one dish that simply must be ordered anytime you dine here. It is like no salad you will ever have because it's a salad in the loosest sense of the term. Arugula, tomatoes, couscous, dried corn, bacon, smoked salmon, and a couple other items that you wouldn't expect. All tossed together in front of you with an amazing basil pesto buttermilk ranch dressing. Order it and you will not be disappointed. 

Mini Mushroom Pan Fry - This is just a smaller version of what the menu proclaims as \"their signature dish\". About eight different kinds of mushrooms sauteed and served with an ancho pepper cream sauce over polenta. It's unique and good, but very filling. I'm not sure I'd want the entree-sized version all to myself. 

Dungeness Crab Stack - Large hunks of crab mixed with shaved fennel bulb and a little diced avocado. It has a light lemony vinaigrette that is infused with tarragon. It all worked together, but it was almost like there were too many subtle flavors in the dish and it added up to it being a little bland. Plus, I got tired of the fennel after a while as I felt there was too much there. 

Elvis in New Orleans - At least I think this is what the dessert was called. All I know is that it was so good. A fresh, warm peanut butter cookie, topped with bourbon ice cream, salted caramel sauce and other things to make your dentist cringe. Completely unredeeming - the way a dessert should be.

The food is priced moderately for what you get. Most small plates are in the $11 - $15 range and are shareable. Entrees range from $20 - $40. The service was very good. Our server was attentive without being a pest and the front reception acknowledged and seated us very quickly. 

Final Take

Cowboy Ciao delivers a solid meal and offers a unique variety of food. Pair that with an impressive (yet cumbersome) wine list and you have a great spot for dining. I will be back again as Ciao has much to offer.

Overall Grade = B+ (Very Good)

{"text":"A friend and I were up  in Phoenix for the day and chose this place for lunch  d/t other Yelp reviews. Must say the Stetson chopped salad was out of this world. A crazy combination of ingredients that work so well together. The high point was the server giving us a copy of the recipe for it! Yeah!  BTW, never knew Mexican Fresca was so different than domestic."}
{"text":"I went to cowboy ciao for my birthday and was very pleased with it! My family typically likes to get a bunch of stuff and share so we started with a chopped salad, the shrimp appetizer and the mushroom appetizer. The shrimp were cooked perfectly and the mushrooms were really flavorful and delicious, however, the chopped salad was the star of the night! It was so good I ended up ordering another one because the first one was devoured so fast. I typically don't think of salads as memorable dishes but this is by far the best salad I have ever had and I would come back just for the chopped salad. To finish it all off, the server brought me a huge piece of delicious chocolate cake on a plate that said happy birthday which was a nice touch! I would definitely recommend this restaurant - great atmosphere and even better food!"}
{"text":"AMAZING!! Start to finish, the BEST lunch we've had in awhile.  We shared the Chicken and Waffles and the Buffalo Shrimp, and finished with the Oh Canada.  Chicken was breaded and fried to perfection. And although a bit tough, the red velvet waffle complemented the rest of the dish well.  
The shrimp were incredible; the perfect heat and light, crisp breading. The pickled carrots were the best Ive ever had.  The dessert was the perfect ending to a truly amazing meal.  
Service was average; the two waitresses seemed upset with someone and were overly chatty with each other, which left our glasses empty and cleaned plates sitting longer than acceptable.  Even with this, I cannot give our experience less than 5 stars. 
The restaurant space and location was nice and clean.  The big open windows gave us a lovely view of Old Town."}
{"text":"Went based on reviews. Highly disappointed. Strangest wine list. Completely arranged by price. We are wine drinkers and gave up on bottles.  Sweet savory fusion not successful. Worst risotto ever, tasted like perfume. Big group tasted lots of things, only liked cop salad and mushroom dish. So sorry"}
{"text":"This place is perfect! Great food, great service and friendly people. We will be back over and over again! We ordered a few different things on the menu and all were excellent (Stetson chopped salad, scallops, testosterone salad). Lovvvve it!"}
{"text":"Have to say, this is one of my new favorite places because of one host. I came in looking for hot chocolate for a special occasion with a good friend and they said they didn't serve anything like that, but he would see what he could do. 15 minutes later, a chef came out with two, delicious cups of hot chocolate made just for us. A+ customer service and definitely made our night!! Thank you again!"}
{"text":"Fantastic chopped salad.  I had the pork shank; very good.  We went to dinner with another couple and really enjoyed the whole experience."}
{"text":"Dropped waaaay off.  Been going here several times a year for years. Loved it for all, until now. The food is good not great like it was, the sides are bleh. It wasn't that one dish was worse, which I might think that's an off might no big deal, but every dish was just meh.. And the portion sizes shrunk, the dessert was maybe a quarter the size it used to be, a total joke. Top it all off, the manager is a putz, all the good managers and service staff that used to work here are gone. The food is 3 stars (down from 5), but the prices are high so on that basis I'm giving it one star."}
{"text":"This place is a nightmare! Food is not good and is over priced. The manager is rude and the restaurant is disgusting. I don't know how this place stays in business! Horrible first time experience,  will never be back. Save your money and go elsewhere!"}
{"text":"For a place with such an interesting and hopeful menu, I was terribly disappointed. Putting chile powder on everything does not make the dish flavorful and is far from creative. Will not be back. Decent service though and would try f n b next door."}
{"text":"Outstanding. Started with a chop salad, tossed table side.  Great rendition with salmon. Had a 12 oz ribeye, grilled veggies, as good as it gets. Great service and ambiance. Decent wine menu, beer selection and desserts worth tying yourself to the treadmill."}
{"text":"Amazing!  Never had airport food this good...ever!  The Open Faced Steak Sandwich was amazing as well as the homemade kettle chips w/Blue Cheese.  My new favorite Airport Restaurant, period!"}
{"text":"Restaurant week rip-off

While reasonably tasty, all of the items were available for less if ordered individually. One might save two dollars over regular prices, but there's no ice cream with the bread pudding, so it's a wash.

More importantly, they surreptiously add a 20% tip and never mention this on the menu or anywhere else!  The couple next to us sat down at the same time as us and were onto entres before our appetizers were served.  One wonders who was the priority.... 

We were also told the first table wouldn't be available until 9:30, but many tables remained uncleared while we ate at the bar (from 8 until 9:20).

I normally think this place is okay, and while the food remained fine, it was a very poor decison to go tonight. Stetson salad remained singular."}
{"text":"Awesome, friendly service. The beef in my salad was melt in your mouth tender. Far exceeded my expectations."}
{"text":"We enjoyed our meal at Cowboy Ciao.  The Chopped Salad is a specialty, and it was delicious.  We split it as a starter, and it was fine, and would probably have been fine for one as a main course.  When we remarked about how good it was, the waiter gave us a copy of the recipe.

We saw that the bread pudding was also recommended, and in order to save room for dessert, we decided on one small entree (crab enchilada) and one larger one (pork).  Both were good (not fabulous, but very good), as was the bread pudding.  

It was full and lively on a Tuesday night.  We had a nice glass of wine with our meal, but the cocktails could use some help.  The cocktail menu is very interesting, but the 2 we ordered were too sweet.

Between the good food and the great service, we would return next time we're in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Eclectic or just \"off\"?  I really can't knock anything about the food, but I can't rave about it either.  The decor is a combo of modern (think Citizen's Public House) and one of the stores you find in Old Town hawking topaz and Indian jewelry.  Not my thing but oh well.

Our server was average at best, and seemed pretty disinterested.  I would recommend some prompts at various stages in the meal vs. his approach of just standing there.  Here are some examples (I base these on having dined out once or twice):

-May I get a drink order put in for you?
-Would you like to start with some appetizers?
-Would you like to see the desert list?
-Can I bring you the check instead of making you wait here 30 minutes in these tiny wooden chairs while your buttcheeks cramp up?

The short rib I had was cooked well, but had little flavor and the jus just appeared to be basic beef broth.  Little Lady had the mushrooms (which were excellent) and the pops had the swordfish which he enjoyed.  I was amped about having Anchor Steam on tap...but alas, it was warm!  The brew from local San Tan Brewery was slightly cool.  Such a disappointment with the suds.

There is obviously some skill with the chef, and 2 stars would be unfair, so based upon the whole shebang 3 stars it is.  'Nuff said!"}
{"text":"Have to say I was really disappointed with my experience. Stopped in for a late Saturday lunch, we were seating immediately and then Forgotten about. It took 20 minutes to get a couple glasses of water. The waiter was distracted with side conversations with the kitchen staff. The food descriptions looked amazing, but felt they were very over priced. Our food came out cold, very dry and bland (panini and scallop risotto were ordered). Overall, may overlook it but won't be back any time soon."}
{"text":"Creative, great-tasting dishes and good cocktails. Service leaves room for improvement. Server was disinterested and would disappear for long stretches."}
{"text":"Cowboy Ciao cannot be relied on to deliver consistently good food. 

A recent visit on a Saturday night rated 4 to 5 stars with exquisitely seasoned food and good wine. Slow/distracted service and an uninspired pea-infused vodka cocktail were the only blemishes. --So I talked this place up to several folks and went for a return visit....on a Tuesday night. 

Big mistake. This last visit rated a 0-1. The food as a whole was overly salty and Brussels sprouts were nearly hard as rocks. Service was very slow with long gaps in between dishes).

On the first visit a Pastrami-style short ribs came accompanied by mashed potatoes and Brussels sprouts - all perfectly cooked and seasoned. On the second, this dish was overly salted and the sprouts were hard and bitter. The waiter brought out new sprouts, but at the time, we had finished eating. 

On the first visit a licorice-infused cake was wonderful, it was the same on the second.  

On the second visit, the scallops appetizer was dreadfully salty and lacked a decent sear. The initial risotto was inedible per so much salt. The waiter brought new risotto out that was edible, but actually needed some salt. (Has the chef thought of tasting his food, I wonder?) The scallops appetizer touted an accompanying \"heirloom tomato salad,\" which comprised five halves of cherry-size tomatoes (or 2.5 cherry-size tomatoes) that seemed to have a bit of oil on them. If I were writing the menu, I don't think I would call it a salad.

The chopped salad was good, but not remarkable, and not worth returning.

On both visits, I noticed that the wait staff sometimes seemed over-burdened with other tables and were slow to deliver things like the next course or a glass of wine. I think that management should step in and help and/or provide ancillary help to the wait staff, who sometimes were dealing with some very large parties.

Ambience is lacking at Cowboy Ciao. It is decorated in a shabby-chic style with faux paint finishes that are tired and even dirty. Artwork is tacky and uninspired. While the dinner tables have white table cloths, they are covered by white paper on top. (I became very aware of the white paper after we walked from bar to table with our glasses which turned out to have bedraggled herbs stuck to the bottom of them (and not herbs that had been served to us --the bar had likely been not wiped well from prior patrons).

On the most recent visit, we learned that the sous chef was leading the kitchen. A companion noted that restaurants often have junior chefs head up the kitchen on less popular nights. I suspect that the executive chef, was at the helm on the weekend night that I had such good food. I guess it pays to know who's in the kitchen, and if they are getting adequate support to do a good job.

I also should have paid attention to the erratic reviews Cowboy Ciao received - many high and lows recently."}
{"text":"i've eaten here all 3 times i've visited scottsdale. my most recent visit to scottsdale was 50% motivated by wanting to eat here (i had free plane tix). my faves (must try's) are the stetson chopped (which i often make at home cuz i crave it so much), the mushroom pan fry and the pig 'n puddin'. i also *loved* the bacon brittle i bought because they were out of the bacon chocolate chip cookies. i've also tried the duck of the sea and buffalo carpaccio, but they were \"just\" good. the cuppa' red hot chocolate had a wonderful flavor, but i couldn't quite finish it cuz it was very rich. love the fun atmosphere here too."}
{"text":"My girlfriends and I were visiting from California and wanted to try Cowboy Ciao.  I don't know if the waitress did not want to work that night or she did not feel like serving us but we received subpar service.  We were a party of 7 and 3 of us wanted hot water with lemon--when I asked the waitress she gave me a look like she was irritated and when she brought out the hot waters, she said \"You know, we do have tea!\"  I have never received any attitude about this request before from any restaurant!  It was not like our party only ordered water and bread.  We ordered plenty of appetizers, entrees, and desserts.  I think that was more than paying $2 per person for tea!  We were served with a lukewarm attitude at best.  Also when I asked where the restroom was, she also seemed annoyed that I was asking her for something.  We've tried other restaurants in the area and received much better service so I know that this waitress is not representative of Arizonian hospitality.  The experience at Cowboy Ciao's was very disappointing."}
{"text":"Very, very good food here.  Get the short ribs if they have them. 

Desserts are unbelievable as well...would be a good place to go just for that!

The short-ribs are served with a cherry BBQ sauce that is unbelievable.  I was so full, but couldn't stop eating.  I've also catered an event here before for a large group and it was awesome.  The menu can change often though based on the chef's desires/etc.

I've been here twice and never left disappointed at all.  It would be a more frequented place if I lived closer to Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I had my first Cowboy Ciao experience this past Saturday. I had the \"Pig and Puddin\" (yes, that is the name). I believe this dish is only served during lunch. The atmosphere was very nice and the staff was great.

The meal was superb. The pulled pork was very tender and seasoned perfectly. The meat was placed on top of some polenta. The polenta was very rich, but wasn't served with a huge portion. There was also some dried cranberries and baby pumpkin seeds on top of the pork to top off the dish.. 

I wouldn't have thought these items would go well together, but they did.

My wife has been here several times and really enjoys the food, especially the Stetson Salad."}
{"text":"This has become my favorite restaurant in Scottsdale for a nice dinner out.  The menu was very unique and they serve generous portions, unlike most of the Scottsdale restaurants.  

To start, our party had 5 people and we had reservations on a Saturday night.  We were seated immediately upon check-in, something that many of the nice steak houses and other restaurants still can't quite figure out.  

We all started with a glass of beer, which they have a great beer and wine selection.  They carry many great choices at reasonable prices.

Our group split the quesadilla of the day, which was very good.  It changes, so I can't remember the actual ingredients, but one of the better quesadillas I have had.

For the main course, I had the pork porterhouse, which does not appear to be on the menu currently.  It was great.  The side came with potatoes au gratin, but was a very unique taste and this alone would bring me back.  I also sampled the mushroom pan-fry, their signature dish.  This was absolutely great and I may order this when I come back again.

Overall a great restaurant in Old Town.  Make sure to have reservations though!"}
{"text":"Had a fabulous dinner last night. Service was excellent! The wine list was extraordinary - largest I've seen. The Stetson Chopped salad is a MUST!!

If you are ever in Scottsdale - don't miss it."}
{"text":"Cowboy chow is great!!! Been here a dozen times at least and always pleased with food and service.  Order the scallops on risotto and as an entree you can't go wrong with the puerco lento, fall of the bone pork served on well seasoned potatoes"}
{"text":"Cowboy Ciao is fantastic!

There is a variety of great food. The staff is courteous and quick. It is family friendly and is fun environment. 

I cannot wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch yesterday with my dad and stepmom. Firstly, the decor certainly didn't \"wow\" me. I was expecting prices for lunch ranging $8-15 considering the decor and paper table covers. 
We ordered the chopped salad, the chicken and waffles and the scallops. Firstly, our waiter was ho-hum, and not prompt with service. 
Our meals ranged from $14-16 and were SO small we all left absolutely starving. The chicken and waffles was HALF of ONE waffle with one SMALL chicken breast. 
My dad's scallops came out undercooked and by the time they came back after he sent them back, we had finished eating. (15 minute wait to recook scallops?!) 
They didn't offer from fresh ones and sent back his original ones which were all cut in half. Appalling. 
Dad then ate by himself and we weren't offered any compensation nor any appetizer free of charge considering we were waiting for him to finish. 
The flavor was good but this is the most OVERPRICED, SMALL-PORTIONED food I have ever encountered in such an establishment that isn't a 5 star restaurant. 
So disappointing."}
{"text":"I bought a Groupon for Sunday brunch a while back & decided to finally use it for Mother's day. I made reservations a couple days prior for my parents, hubby & myself at noon. Surprisingly we arrived before my parents & were seated at a table in the open dining area.

I started off with a glass of milk (skim) while my hubby opted for dr. pepper. FYI- they only have bottled sodas, cute but at $6 a pop too damn expensive! My parents arrived & my dad started off with a bloody mary & my mom got her usual sprite, hers may have been a tad cheaper at $4 but still ridiculous. They really should invest in a soda fountain, just sayin. For apps we ordered the quesadilla (which had bacon, onions, potatoes & cheese with a delicious drizzle) & the bruschetta. The quesadilla was amazing, I wish I ordered 2 more for my entree! The bruschetta was just ok. For our entrees: dad & hubs ordered the breakfast enchiladas, mom ordered their signature mushroom dish & I ordered the fried egg & bacon sandwich. The boys enjoyed their enchiladas, mom didn't care for her mushroom dish & my sandwich was just ok. Disappointed with my entree I wanted to order dessert, but no one else did so I opted for a bag of their chocolate & bacon caramel popcorn to take home. I loved the popcorn, the sweet with a lil bit of salt from the bacon was such a yummy combo.

What annoyed me about this place were the prices, even with my $30 coupon our total came out to $87 (not including tip). Not too bad, about $30 per person, but my dad was the only person who got cocktails (2) & the food was pretty average at best. I'm glad I finally tried this place out but I don't think I'll be returning."}
{"text":"Well I was looking for a new and fun place to celebrate my Fiancé's birthday but this wasn't really the place for that. A higher end restaurant, it was very pretty and the stenson salad was as everyone says to die for but everything else was pretty mediocre. Service was very slow and poor, I called and made a reservation even letting them know it was for a birthday and the birthday boy was the one who got the worst service. Our drinks took a while to get and one of them was forgotten twice. The food that was suppose to be hot was luke warm. So little to say we prolly won't be coming back. I was very sad as I've read how nice of an experience everyone else had but ours wasn't that. Service is very very slow. Took 2.5 hours to get outta there and it wasn't very busy."}
{"text":"I feel this restaurant seems to be having an identity crisis when it comes to the ambiance.  It's a mix of the Texas Roadhouse meetings Le Cirque but definitely not on Le Cirque's level.

We had high expectations after seeing the other yelp reviews and drooling over the menu, but for me those quickly faded within 15 minutes of entering.

I ordered  the wagyu burger.  Being the incredibly picky eater I am, I asked the server what would come on the burger.  He didn't exactly tell me everything on the burger that when I got it, I had to remove some stuff that I didn't want.  So that in itself ruined my experience.   The end result was okay but left a bad taste in my mouth.

Another instance of what I feel was bad communication was that I wanted to order a side of fries.  I knew they had fries as there were other entrees that had fries listed.  However, the waiter looked at me like I was from Mars when I asked if I could order a side of fries.

Other reasons for the bad review

1. No free refills on soft drinks.
2. We had a waiter that seemed to have a stick up his you know what
3. The decor made me feel like I was inside a pepto bismol bottle while drunk.

Just not my cup of tea."}
{"text":"Awesome chop salad... get it!
Country fried fish was spectacular.  They let us in even though we came in a couple of minutes outside of their business hours.  Cool atmosphere,  very friendly staff.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I would probably give this 3.5, but not an option.  I liked the looks of the place, and the menu was unique for sure.  I of course had the Stetson salad, which was fantastic.  I also had the scallops in goat cheese and beets.  This also was quite good.  The people I went with said their meals were good, but not great.  My main issue was that they were out of the bottle of wine we ordered, and brought a different one (which they recommended).......which also cost more, and it was not good at all....We went to order a second bottle later (yes, we like to drink LOTS) and they were out of that bottle as well.....so we drank Polish beer instead.  I like restaurants like this and they have a great menu, but at least update your wine list."}
{"text":"The food is tastes great. It's creative and inventive. I'm only giving the place 3 stars because the decor is VERY outdated and distracts from the great food."}
{"text":"A fantastic oasis in the desert of bad food and drink plaguing Americas airports. Stop in for a nice glass of wine and a delicious salad accompanied by a good playlist."}
{"text":"Don't be fooled by the all the people inside and the vibrant atmosphere.
I will eat anywhere including dives as long as the food is good. The food here not good. Its average

One of the worst feelings is going out to dinner with your spouse and spending over a $100 and not liking your meal. This place consistently gives you this feeling. I ordered a rack of lamb and they served it with a sauce that simply overpowered the meat. Good meat need only be lightly dressed in my opinion. The second time I ordered a steak which was underwhelming. I will not be back for a 3rd try."}
{"text":"The service was good and the chopped salad was excellent. Unfortunately we didn't enjoy the scallops or shrimp dish on the starters menu. The risotto with the scallops was really bland and the the corn nuts made me feel like the scallop had sand on it. The shrimp was also horribly over cooked. Was surprised the server didn't wonder why so much of the food wasn't eaten. Don't think we'd go back."}
{"text":"So, so good! My newest favorite place in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Fast service and not bad prices for an import restaurant - however - I ordered the chicken wrap and was horrified when it came out with a completely cold spinach tortilla on the outside.  It had grill marks and everything but was so cold that it obviously came out of a plastic package looking that way, as a result the contents were also cold. For me that's a big faux pas."}
{"text":"Meh, It didn't live up to the reviews.   It's a bit pretentious and probably best left to the foodies. I like to try local wines and asked specifically about them twice, but still had to search through the very large wine list to find something local to AZ and under $100. To be fair my husband is pretty picky, but he ordered a filet medium without the peppercorn/tomato butter. He got a very rare steak.  He ate around the edges and when the waitress checked in she took it back to be cooked longer, however still came back very rare. We didn't want to send it back a second time so essentially wasted 1/4 of a $38 steak. And I didn't want tomatoes or salmon on my chopped salad, so we probably insulted someone's sensibilities by changing their \"vision\"- I think they were so upset they forgot to put the truffle oil on my truffle Mac & cheese ( really Mac and béchamel) making not worth the calories. However, that chopped salad was amazing ( even without tomatoes and salmon).  Bottom line: this place is for open minded (and \"palated\") people who are comfortable in places that have an overblown sense of who/what they are."}
{"text":"2/05/16
This was without a doubt the most ridiculous experience I've ever encountered in the 6-8 times I've been at this restaurant in the past year. We walked into the place at 5:00, our reservation time, and was walked over to the table 2 or 3 stations away from the hostess station. Considering it was literally a ghost town since they just opened and we were waiting on our guest, I didn't want to feel like we were at Dennys slamming down the Early Bird Special, so I said I'll be at the bar for a drink. The hostess looked at me with a perplexed expression as if I said I was going for a jog and I'll be back later. She informed me that they needed the table by 8:30. Not a problem, I think we can be in and out in 3 1/2 hours. 15 minutes into the first and only drink the bartender put the bill in front of me and asked me to close out. He said they needed the table, \"ya, at 8:30 they do, its only 5:15\" At that point they sat a party just next to ours who objected to the sun burning their retinas to a crisp and was given our table. As I watched I thought, no big deal, the place only has 2 tables occupied, I don't think getting another table will be a problem. Don't you just hate being wrong? At 5:30 we asked to be seated and was shown the table closest to the door and reception podium. Basically its like being seated at the kids table on Thanksgiving when the adult dinning room table is completely empty. We were told since we didn't close out the bar bill immediately it showed we didn't care about the table and they were able to give it away. WTF, where did that assumption come from? I inquired about the other 30 plus empty tables and the poor excuse of a manager said this was the only table available. I asked about another specific table and his response was \" that's for the party at 6:30\", my reply of course was \"so why not give them the table next to the door\", again no response. He also said in between smirks, that 2 feet shouldn't make a bit of difference to me.  I  brought to his attention that it wasn't  his call to make, and all he had to do was walk over 20 feet to the bar where I was dropping money to inform us as to what was about to transpire. Again he just looked at me like Martin Shkreli, thinking that his hipster smirk was an awesome answer. Honestly, I didn't know whether to be totally pissed at him, look for cameras from a Tosh.O production company or feel sorry for him because he might be suffering from mild brain damage. After asking him if this was really his day job or just a hobby, we left and went across the street. Its very unfortunate that CC has someone working the front who is so anti cerebral and doesn't have a clue on how to treat clientele."}
{"text":"We have eaten here a number of times when visiting the Scottsdale area and by and large they really a do a nice job with their menu.  Our waiter knew both the wine list as well as the menu and did a great job steering us in both directions.

I do have a major gripe about the wine list. It is unapproachable. I get why you sort your list by price but in today's modern era of iPads you are doing yourself and your customers a disservice by not being able to sort your 2,500 bottle list by varietal or vintage.  I can and will pay for something that might fall outside of the price range that I may be targeting, but as this list is so massive I don't know that you have it."}
{"text":"If there were less than 1 star, or negative stars, I'd rate it with that. I have been sitting here for upwards of 40 minutes and have not been approached once. I ordered my beer at the bar and then took a seat along the wall, and on two separate occasions the waitresses; two depicted in my attached photos, stood around socializing scanning the room, and conveniently not realizing I was sitting 10 feet away from them. So my glass is empty, no one has asked me if I would like an appetizer or a meal, and there are probably two or three other people with a quizzical look on there faces, wondering if someone will notice them too.  I wish I could have attached a picture of the time going by as I sit here with an empty glass and the table with no food on it.

So the girl depicted in my photograph finally approached me and then scolded me for having not followed whatever protocol they have for establishing a tab. Apparently if I bought a beer at the bar and then chose to sit down at a table I am prohibited from attaining any additional service.  It's the girl with her hair in a fountain style ponytail."}
{"text":"Really fun place to go to with great food. The Stetson salad came highly recommended and for good reason. Simple fresh ingredients just came together in the best possible way- Israeli couscous, crunchy dried corn, nutty arugula, sweet currants, I'm drooling just thinking about it! Wild boar meatballs were medium rare, not gamey at all in a cream sauce and the mushroom entree with the a millions different mushrooms in a sinful cream sauce what a winner. Finish it all off with any of the house made desserts but you must have the brown butter ice cream- yum!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been going to Cowboy Ciao for years. We moved away from Phoenix nearly 10 years ago, but still go back when we can. The menu and the service is amazing! There are so many unique dishes, I recommend the risotto (the one of the lamb chop is spectacular!) also the mushroom pan fry cannot be missed! Recently we had a wonderful dinner, and when they didn't have the wine we wanted, the manager made a great recommendation and let us try it first to make sure we liked it. I would highly recommend Cowboy Ciao, but make your reservations well in advance! Depending on the time of year, its hard to get in - they are so popular! Also, try Kazimerz around the corner for pre-dinner drinks and fabulous appetizers!"}
{"text":"Never got a chance to taste the food.  I had 25 minutes until my flight and ordered.  When I asked after about 15 minutes I was told my ticket had been lost.  I paid to speed up the process and the waitress was going to put it in a to go bag.  It just took too long and I had to leave.   $23 gone and no food.  The waitress tried but...."}
{"text":"Great salad. Great wine list. Chronic Cellars Purple Paradise for under 30, incredible deal. Kenna was a GREAT server, very friendly and attentive. Good to see local restaurants represented among the chain madness in the terminal."}
{"text":"I've been here so many times. Celebrated special occasions, date night, and just to have a good meal. The food and service are always good. They have an extravagant wine menu (a huge binder) and I've had pretty much everything on the menu. I'm never disappointed. However that Stetson Chopped Salad has been my favorite salad for years now. No matter where we go there is nothing like it. It has its own Facebook page - which would tell you a thing or two about its fan base."}
{"text":"On a whim, we stopped by this restaurant on a Wednesday night in Old Town Scottsdale after reading rave reviews on Yelp and elsewhere.  We completely understand why!  We were greeted enthusiastically at the door, and took the last two seats at the bar.   We eat out at least four or five times a week in Philly, and are seriously spoiled!  Without a doubt, KEIFER is one of the very best bar tenders/servers we've ever had.  Fun, attentive, helpful and knowledgeable about the food and wine, Keifer took phenomenal care of us.  He is just awesome and made a delicious dinner even better just by being him.  Owners of Cowboy Ciao:  This young man is a gem!  We're in Arizona every few months and your restaurant is now on our \"must do\" list.  We split the filet mignon which was prepared to perfection, the potatoes were \"rave worthy\" and the lightly breaded summer squash simply divine.  We also had the peanut butter dessert - very very good if not a bit pretentious.  We saw - strangely for the southwest - many appetizer plates of scallops coming out of the kitchen which we'll try on the next visit.  Bravo Kiefer and Cowboy Ciao - well done!"}
{"text":"I positively love this place!  ...But I am glad I didn't read the reviews before I went for the first time, because, if I had, I might have had such high expectations that nothing could live up to it!!

I have been lucky enough to never have to wait though - once on a fluke \"not very busy\" Saturday night and three weekend lunches.

The Stetson salad alone is worth it.  It is unlike anything else, anywhere else, but it's very rich.  I recommend sharing it!  I have also had the Mac & Cheese (good with a spicy little kick), the stuffed pork chop (extraordinary), the Duck and Brie sandwich (interesting, but not quite as good as it sounded), and the Flatbread (delicious that day, and even better the next!)

And, I've always had good service too."}
{"text":"Great food and service. Unique dishes without getting too crazy. Typically have good specials as well.  The wine list is the size of a novel and almost has too many wines (don't know where to start).   We will continue to go back."}
{"text":"Walking around the neighborhood and saw a local and asked for a recommendation and he sent us here. Great choice! Came in for dinner on a Saturday night without a reservation and we had no wait. Everything was delicious!! We shared a Stetson chopped salad (YOU MUST TRY IT!) and had the mushroom pan fry and steak. Everything was perfectly cooked and so tasty.  At our servers recommendation we tried the frosted flake dessert...gosh I might have that name wrong. Hot cookie with ice cream rolled in crunchies...delish!! Drinks were good, service was great..I will be back!"}
{"text":"We just went to Cowboy Ciao (because I had LOVED it in the past) last night for our anniversary, and I have to sadly say we were SO disappointed.  There was a wad of chewed up gum stuck to our table, that I put my elbow in. The service was slow, and it took over an hour and forty minutes for our main course.  After our server promised us for the 4th time that our dinner would be right out,  we finally just asked her  to pack it up to go.   I had a sneaking suspicion that she had forgot to put our order in after our appetizers and it was confirmed today when we went to heat up the pork chop (30.00) and it was RAW inside!  So disappointing.  The one bright spot in the night was the pork belly and waffles which was heaven, the Stetson salad was good as well.  I waited tables all through college and understand the kitchen can get in the weeds, or as a server you can forget to put an order in, but this was ridiculous and her way of dealing with it was to ignore us all together.  Not a good experience!"}
{"text":"Come here just for the chopped salad!! It is AMAZING.  Strange but delicious, corn, couscous, salmon, and a lite and wonderful dressing... do I need to go on??  Just come here, eat the chopped salad, and be happy I told you to do so :-) You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Good was excellent and the chopped salad lived up to expectations. Wife had a wine flight and it was not very good."}
{"text":"I am in Cowboy Ciao at the airport now waiting on my flight and I am very happy I stopped in.  The chopped salad with salmon is really good. I just finished it.  Can't wait for my next trip through Phoenix."}
{"text":"I've eaten here at least 70 times over the years.  Its food is consistently very good, and it certainly is not cookie cutter or formulaic.  They may try too hard to be unique at times, but they almost always get it right.  The wine list is the most amazing in Arizona, but I wish they organized it by varietal or region so you can navigate it better."}
{"text":"Great service, nice place to chill if at airport early, quick walk over to b gates if flying Us airways.  James was a great server, nice, and enjoyed the enchilada breakfast with scrambled eggs rather than fried."}
{"text":"Writing the a bit into the future, so some of the details are hazy..

Stopped here on a layover in Phoenix on the way to LA.  Ordered the Lester Burger which could have easily been two meals.  Burger, bacon, avocado, pulled pork and more on a single sandwich.  Delicious.

Met a new friend in the military also on a layover and we bought drinks for each other.  

Waitstaff was attentive and seemed happy to be there.  Food came out quickly and drinks didn't stay empty for long. Had a nice time.  Easily one of the best airport dining experiences I've ever had."}
{"text":"Loved this place!  Came here with girlfriends and we had the mushrooms, filet and short rib entrees. Each meal was phenomenal. Would definitely recommend and visit again."}
{"text":"I came here as part of a food tour we took during our stay in Scottsdale. We tried their pulled pork tacos and homemade chips and salsa, everything was DELICIOUS!!! Our guide also told us about happy hour taco night ( I can't remember when it is) but next time we are in Scottsdale, we will for sure have ourselves more of their amazing tacos!!!"}
{"text":"We had a layover in Phoenix on our way to Albuquerque in both directions on our recent vacation and happened across this great find.  We couldn't believe it was airport food.  There were 4 of us and everyone loved their meal, both times we went.  The chopped salad was amazing.  We all split a piece of chocolate cake for desert and it was great as well.  If you're at the Phoenix Airport, this place is a must.  Service was great as well - we got in and out in plenty of time for our flights."}
{"text":"Not often you find an airport restaurant that you would frequent if not stuck in an airport.  Very prompt cheerful service.  I sat at the bar and had the open faced steak sandwich.  Very flavorful with a 5 star presentation.  For the price I was expecting the typical airport food value vs price disappointment.  This is definitely not your fathers airport food."}
{"text":"Every anniversary my wife and I try one of the better restaurants in the valley that we've never been to before. This year, we chose Cowboy Ciao.

We made reservations and were quickly seated even when we ran 10 minutes late (thank you!). We saw a lot that sounded good on the menu, so we asked our server for a reccomendation and started with a Mini Mushroom Pan Fry. Mushrooms were well-cooked, and a tasty sauce, but the polenta hiding underneath really didn't add much.

For our entres, we had the Grilled Swordfish and the Rack of Wild Boar. Both weren't particularly tender, and the miscellaneous roots and vegetables served underneath the protein really didn't impress at all. Throughout the meal, it felt uncomfortably warm. I just can't imagine that an established restaurant in Scottsdale wouldn't be conscious of the temperature on a summer night.

At the end of the meal, our server brought a slice of cake to go after we said we were too full for dessert. Overall, the service was average.

Two stars because at the end of the night, when my wife and I walked out, it wasn't just an average experience: we were a bit disappointed."}
{"text":"I seriously cannot knock the quality of food. I had the fillet mignon which was cooked to perfection and my knife sliced through like butter.
It isn't easy on the credit card, but it is very good food and attentive service."}
{"text":"Such a nice surprise. Fantastic food, unique drinks and service at an airport. I recommend the short ribs!"}
{"text":"The worst service I have had in a long time.  Given the prices, the service should be flawless.  Food was good but ruined by terrible waitress.  I will not go back."}
{"text":"one of my faves. i ALWAYS take my nyc friends here for something unique that they wouldn't expect from,,,,,phoenix??!!#% :D

me, i like to graze. small bites and i can't keep away from the berkshire pork belly/ berkshire anything + pork belly = can't pass it up. truffle mac/cheese. my two faves. salads are great too"}
{"text":"AWESOME BREAKFAST ENCHILADAS! And a friendly bartender who provided quality service. Countertop was sticky but otherwise the best place I could have passed time in Terminal 4."}
{"text":"Had a few hours delay because of AA - but what's new... Best delay ever. This bar rocks, super good food and friendly/nice people. 
Doug at the bar is the best! Thank you to make my miserable day a bit better."}
{"text":"We were in Phoenix area and wanted to try different. We went there for dinner, for the price you are paying its just OK.

There are other restaurants better than this one around the area."}
{"text":"Had a fabulous dinner starting with a delicious cocktail and a wonderful meal.  Our waiter was very attentive, informative and all around great.  Will definitely return back and recommend this place.  Thanks!"}
{"text":"First, the wine list is riddiculous, but that is part of their schtick.  I  mean silly the wine list. It is bigger than a phone book, I am not kidding! Worse, the list is organzed by price rather than varietal and region. The list serves two restaurants Cowboy Ciao and Kasmierz. Cowboy Ciao is successful, because of location, setting, and the food is good. I went with l and my dad and his new wife. We had the k vintners highly rated wine for $200. I have a better memory with wines than what we ate."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Cowboy Ciao last night and it was amazing!  Every time we go it is such a great experience.

The menu had so many options, but I went with the Smoke, Sugar, Shank.  It was so tasty and juicy.  So good!

The service was top notch as well."}
{"text":"Airports food normally doesn't invite feelings of warmth, comfort or health. On the recommendation of the security officers, we checked out Cowboy Ciao and were amazed at our experience. The menu was creative, combining fresh ingredients with good taste. I had the mushroom skillet, my hubbie had bruschetta and truffle  macaroni and cheese. The bruschetta was so so, but the other two were truly yummy. Perhaps most engaging was our waiter TJ. He welcomed us as if we had just arrived into his own kitchen. Made sure we knew how to reach him, brought our food and drinks promptly, and checked in frequently. Never had airport food or service like this before!"}
{"text":"So with an almost 2.5 hour layover, I needed a place to just chill and enjoy a good meal. Airports are not known for that. Thankfully I came across Cowboy Ciao. Make sure to give this place a spot if you are spending some time at the airport.

Service is excellent and friendly. TJ and crew are very attentive and welcoming. 

Got the soup of the day, a pulled pork. Looked great and tasted great. 

The mushroom dish? Awesome and filling. I can't go into more detail because I'm too full and satisfied."}
{"text":"Went to Cowboy Ciao about 6 or 7 years ago and got the Stetson Chopped Salad. Been craving it ever since and finally satisfied the craving when I went back earlier this month. The salad is exceptional, offering a very unique combination of ingredients (who thinks to combine couscous and salmon!?!?) and is mixed table side. We also indulged in the mini mushroom pan fry, the tiger prawns and the scallops so we could sample a few other dishes. In my opinion, you can't top the salad but the other dishes were good although I have to say I could have done without the scallops - nothing to write home about. Overall, good service, nice ambiance and definitely worth going (if nothing more than for the salad!)"}
{"text":"The food is not half bad. However the service at the bar is atrocious. I sat there for 10 minutes trying to get the bartender's  attention. He just kept ignoring me, or he was deaf. After I got my food, I got no silverware. Did not even get a water refill. I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Cowboy Ciao threatens us with a reservation cancelation fee which was never disclosed to us when making the reservation.  Poor customer service and rude receptionists."}
{"text":"TJ is an awesome server i have eaten here lots before always worth the wait to be seated."}
{"text":"The food is phenomenal!  However, the service - not so much.
We sat down, ordered some water, and began to look at the menu.  The server did not come back for quite some time...when he finally did, we ordered some drinks and the blue cheese stuffed olives. He offered my mom a taste of the wine before she ordered it, and that was helpful.  After we got our drinks, my mom and I both ordered the chopped salad which I called OMG in a bowl.  We also ordered some cibatta to go with the salad.  The salads came - they are AMAZING!  Halfway through the salad, my mom reminded the server of the bread.  At the end of the salad, the bread arrived.  The bread was...fabulous..but would've been nicer to eat WITH the salad, instead of after the salad.  At the end of the meal, the server remembered the olives, so he brought those with the check.  He did not charge us for them, but still it would have been nice to have WITH the drinks.  I joked with my mom that we had a backwards meal.
Bottom line - the food is terrific..a good value for the price.  However, the service was sub-par."}
{"text":"Had the Mac and Cheese and the Pork Hamburger with avocado. Good restaurant for being in an airport."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner with two other people while on a business trip.  The food was actually pretty good.  It is located in a great area also, near a lot of interesting little shops.

I'm not sure what the classification of food would be... it's eclectic.  I had the following:
Blue Crab Appetizer - Crab and avocado basically.  The crab was tasty.
Scallops - Pretty Good scallops, not really a fan of the risotto.
Mushroom Pan Fry - Good.  I am a huge mushroom fan.  I really liked the mushrooms but the sauce was a little too much and possibly drained the tase of the mushrooms a little bit.

Their desserts are strange too.  I don't remember what it was called but it had the word lavender in it.  The ice cream was \"Earl Grey\" flavored and actually pretty good, but the pie/cake thing was meh.

Atmosphere is pretty much pitch black.  Prices are on the higher side but not too bad.  Parking will be impossible at dinner time.  You will have to valet it nearby for $5 plus tip."}
{"text":"The chopped salad with smoked salmon, the Lost Highway Black IPA, the music....perfect!"}
{"text":"Have to admit, stumbled across Cowboy when I couldn't get into FnB, but I'm glad I did.  

Had the most wonderful short rib I've ever tasted.  Ordered the Korean BBQ Short Rib....seriously delicious.  The quinoa was a perfect accompaniment to the dish.

Also ordered the house margarita, perfect balance of acid and sweet.

The service was great and would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Wow, can't believe this is in an airport! I'm glad it is. Stopped here for a quick breakfast, ordered the breakfast enchiladas & they were AMAZING! Great ambience, great service, so full & satisfied!"}
{"text":"So many great options, it's hard to go wrong! Of course, do yourself a favor and try their famous Stetson Chopped Salad. Be warned it's almost a full meal by itself. The Truffled Mac n Cheese is a guilty pleasure. Then, if you're lucky enough to catch the 'One Time' on their drink menu, you better give it a try before it disappears again!"}
{"text":"Food wasn't too great, though the service was fast and thr price wasn't bad. I would suggest going to a different place."}
{"text":"There are so many better options to dine in this area - don't waste your time here. I went here with a larger group for a business dinner, it was the only place we could get in without a reservation. The food was sub par and way overpriced. You won't be missing out on much if you skip the visit to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Great service and excellent wine selection!  Stetson chopped salad and mushroom polenta!  Super awesome!"}
{"text":"I love that they have a \"different\" menu. Lots of unique choices - all good! 

My usual go to is the chopped salad with the lox and couscous. It is definitely my favorite, but everything here is good! 

Try something you normally wouldn't eat here and you won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"Chop salad: Servers are quick to make it sound like something special from a restaurant in heaven; however, it isn't \"the best ever!\" but rather a good salad.  Citizens Public house around the corner has almost the exact same salad, and the taste is negligible.
  This place is very OVERPRICED for the quality of the food.  We ordered the the chopped salad, Tiger Shrimp (I think that was the name) appetizer, and Filet Mignon with yukon mashed potatoes.  

Chopped salad: good
Tiger Shrimp: good
Filet Mignon: Worst Filet mignon we have ever had!  Very disappointing, and we have had Filet Mignon at some of the nicest restaurants in almost every city we've been in.  We don't have overly high expectations either, just that it is lean and taste good.
The filet mignon that we got was VERY fatty.  We almost couldn't eat it.  This is a big no-no for a more expensive restaurant. We left hungry so we headed to the Gelato Spot.
  The beer selection didn't have any flagship beers.  I didn't recognize a single one on the menu.  I love a wide variety of beers from Newcastle to Corona to Heineken to Widers Pear Cider to Blue Moon to Bud and Miller light.  None of these options were available.  This is okay because I'm sure there were unique beers, I just wanted to let you know in case you like sticking with your usual.
 Wine list was extensive though.

Service was good.  Our server was attentive.  With so many better places to eat right around the corner, I wouldn't pay the price they are asking for subpar food.  Also, the ambiance was nothing to write home about given the cost of the food."}
{"text":"This is a must try restaurant.  I loved the wine flights.  If you eat here, you should definitely try one.  I would recommend the Mexican Standoff (no, it's not Mexican wine).  You HAVE to try the Stetson Salad.  This was maybe the best thing I had there.  The pork belly sandwich was also very good but a little short on the pork.  The mushroom pan fry was good but I'm not sure why it's a specialty.  The entrees were good but I think the salads and sharing plates were even better.  The espresso rubbed fillet and the fish were both good but not the reason to go.  The dessert... wow.  That earl grey ice cream is amazing.  Friendly service, fun atmosphere... a must try."}
{"text":"I sat down at the bar to have a quick drink between flights.  After ten minutes and not so much as a hi, I'm moving on."}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to trying this place, especially after seeing that Phoenix magazine voted their upside down peanut butter brownie the best dessert in Phoenix.

I'm not a big salad fan, but the Stetson Chopped salad is delicious.  If the service wasn't so bad, I'd go back just to get the salad and dessert.

About the service.  It took over 1 1/2 hours for my girlfriend and I to have dinner on Friday night.  Granted, it was busy, but that seems an exorbitant amount of time for 2 people to have dinner.  Not only that, but it was really warm in there.  It was literally cooler outside when we left than it was in the restaurant.  Not a good sign on a hot summer night.

As if that weren't bad enough, the waiter refilled my water a grand total of once.  And that was only after I asked.  Twice.

The icing on the cake for me was when the bill came.  Not only had I been subjected to the worst service I can remember in Scottsdale, but they had added on a 20% gratuity.  Did I mention that it was just 2 of us dining?  When did this become acceptable?

Suffice it to say we won't be going back."}
{"text":"I will drive ten miles out of the way to eat here!  The salad is amazing and so is the carpaccio."}
{"text":"I live, work, eat, in San Diego however I happen to hail from the Grand Canyon State and happened upon Cowboy Ciao on a brief biz trip. I think this place has some of the most delicious food I've ever had and makes me miss Arizona! My parents took me there- they loved it and they even whipped up a special BBQ sauce ON THE SPOT for my Mom because she had a food allergy. Oh, AZ how I miss thee... Fancy Cowboy food included. I recommend the meat- of course!!!"}
{"text":"Food was amazing! Had the chopped salad, vegetarian style, and my waiter TJ was attentive, helpful, sold me on the salad!! Travel for work all the time which is not fun but can't wait to come back and eat here!  Please franchise in San Jose!"}
{"text":"I've had too many crappy hamburgers/lousy pizza slices while on layovers in airports.  Thought I'd try this as a change.  Ordered the scallops on top of risotto.  Amazing.  Scallops were done just right; risotto could not have been better.  Having cooked risotto myself, I know what a pain it is to make; theirs was perfect."}
{"text":"Wow.  You know you're in trouble when you try a place for lunch, eat the leftovers for dinner and return the next day for dinner.  This is that kind of place.

If you're a bread fiend like I am, you'll find yourself considering ordering two of the Asiago loaves - one to eat now and one to freeze, a pretty good system.  Mac and cheese is just so good, the ham and cheese sandwich is good, the open face steak sandwich is ridiculous, and the pastrami style short rib - in platter or reuben is absolutely one of the best dishes I've ever had.  The short rib has never been fatty, the portion is generous and the flavor is outstanding.  I've also had the filet entree which I thought was great, husband tried the burger and loved it with the confit.  Wine selection is outstanding.

We had one waitress that was a dud but service has been pretty good otherwise.  They get so busy for lunch and dinner it can be slow but that's ok, I can wait."}
{"text":"I have never had anything here that wasn't delicious. I am especially partial to the mushroom pan fry and most recently I had the confit and cornbread which was fantastic. Their wine list is a bit chaotic as the wines are listed by price instead of type/region and usually they are out of the first wine I pick, but the staff is very helpful with their recommendations. I do notice the occasional bout of Scottsdale attitude with the staff, but it's never been enough to keep me from loving this restaurant."}
{"text":"We went back again this year.  I had the best vodka martini at the suggestion of our server.  Blue cheese stuffed olives...amazing.

Oh...the food is still incredible."}
{"text":"Wow.  This could possibly be the worst experience I've ever had at a restaurant.  First, they seated us in a back room that had a completely different ambience from the main dining room... this was like a bad addition with high-watt fluourescent spotlights and rickety tables crammed into the corners surrounding a party of ~20.  The worst part, however, was the insanely loud party of Scottsdale douchebags that were having some sort of party in the room.  The staff acted like they didn't even notice and made no attempt to quiet them... I'm talking slamming on tables, screaming across the room at one another, and just general douchebaggery.  The food was mediocre... the appetizers were cold and my pork chop was certainly nothing special.  

Do yourself a favor and spend your money somewhere else."}
{"text":"Bad food, worse service.  Biscuits and gravy were rock hard, couldn't even cut them.  Stay away."}
{"text":"Food is great. Service is the opposite. We went with no reservations. The hostess was rude and dismissive when we told her this. Let us know we can go to the bar which is fine, but a kinder attitude would have been appreciated. One of our meals never came and the forgot a drink too. No apologies and nothing done to correct it. If the food wasn't so good this review would have 0 stars. Shame too because the restaurant has a great atmosphere overall."}
{"text":"Great breakfast spot, I walked from the other concourse to come eat here. I was recommended the enchiladas and it was tasty. Great layover restaurant for sure."}
{"text":"We had a gift certificate and headed out here on a Sunday for dinner.  It was very nice, great service, good food, will go back again!  I had the mushroom dish and it was enough for 2 people!"}
{"text":"We ate here over the weekend. $90 for two people with no alcohol. My wife's \"chicken\" was so dry she didn't eat it. I had the pasta with steak, which was no better then what you would get at chili's. Yet another mediocre place that doesn't even remotely live up to its prices."}
{"text":"Chopped salad is delicious! I got it with the smoked salmon. Service was good and the lunch was tasty."}
{"text":"Delicious dinner! Our service was great until our dinner was served. After that our waiter forgot about us. That made the last part of our experience disappointing. Wanted dessert however lost our appetite. Bummer because we were having a fun date night!"}
{"text":"Price is high but fast food and great tasting. People are very friendly and seem to no what's the best on the menu would eat here again"}
{"text":"Since being introduced to Cowboy Ciao over ten years ago, I have been a regular visitor on my annual trips to Scottsdale.  My friends told me to try their Stetson Chopped Salad.  It is very good, but do try their other selections and ask to see their extensive wine list."}
{"text":"The food was absolutely fabulous. Our waiter Jeremy was great as well. I had the filet and my wife had their salmon. Perfect!!"}
{"text":"Love the bold flavors. Most of the dishes have cream or something that makes it rich and decadent. Crab enchiladas had an awesome cream sauce. Oh and the bread pudding dessert is the best ever bread pudding. Try the cocktails- found that it went great with the food and an option to opt out of their lengthy and expensive wine menu."}
{"text":"Had the testosterone salad and it was really good. It's hard to mess up a salad but the beef that came with it was very tender and the salad itself was fresh and had the perfect ratio of blue cheese dressing which can be overwhelming if it isn't carefully added. Plus, it had potato chips which gave an extra crunch. I actually liked this place better than the restaurant I went to outside the airport. Customer service was also on point and they played cute, feel good 60-70s music."}
{"text":"Have been to Cowboy Ciao for the last 6 years when coming for Spring Training.  Always enjoyed it.  However, even though I made a reservation six weeks in advance, they tried to seat us in the back room which lacked any ambience of the restaurant!  They wouldn't change us so we just left!  Bad customer service.."}
{"text":"Cowboy Ciao states, \"Our aim is simple and true: thrill each and every guest, at every visit, with an entertaining and memorable dining experience.\" I wish Cowboy Ciao had lived up to its promise. The Roaring Fork is better for \"urban cowboy\" food, which is a surprise given the rave reviews that Cowboy Ciao has received.  

The restaurant has dubbed the decor \"Border Baroque,\" and they note \"one reviewer called it Addams Family meets Old West bordello.\" To me, it's more like a Disney version of Spanish Colonial/Santa Fe with a \"Touched by an Angel\" vibe. One of the weirder elements is a raised table for four surrounded by faux adobe walls.  Prominently displayed above the table is a vintage-style black and white photo of a nearly nude male that has some strong gay bar overtones. The photo is cool, but it has a Rudolph Valentino feel and the only part about it that is even remotely southwestern is the wooden frame. It's an odd choice, but that is true for the entire Cowboy Ciao atmosphere.     

The layout of the dinner menu is also odd. It starts off by listing the desserts at the very top. The titles leave lots to the imagination as there is no detail provided and it's unclear why the menu lists the final element of the meal first. The intent may have been to tease the diner with a tempting array of sweet (and savory) endings, but it really looks more like it was laid out by an inexperienced member of a high school newspaper staff. 

The Stetson Chopped salad ($12) was recommended by our server. It's odd that the menu provides no description for this salad, but that may be because the restaurant thinks this dish's reputation precedes it. The presentation of the salad is nice as it is arranged in rows of the individual ingredients running across the bowl (however, this presentation of salad is hardly original). The salad shows off good knife skills in the kitchen as the ingredients are uniformly chopped. The server walked us through the elements and then tossed the salad with the buttermilk pesto dressing. The BF really liked this dish and I thought the flavors were good and that the dressing was an interesting blend of ingredients. However, I really disliked the texture. It was chewy and gummy; almost like chewing salmon salad flavored gum. It's also over-priced. The entire salad would have measured less than a cup, so it made for a meager split appetizer. It's not like the ingredients for the salad are expensive. It's made up of cooked Israeli (pearl) couscous, Roma tomatoes, air-dried sweet corn, arugula, smoked salmon, and asiago cheese with toasted pepitas and dried black currants. 

Given the stingy portion on the Stetson Chopped, we decided to try the Mini Mushroom Pan Fry ($14). It's a scaled down version of the restaurant's signature entree. It features cremini, button, oyster, cepe, lobster, black, trumpet, shiitake, morel and yellow foot mushrooms in ancho cream. The sauce was a deep brown color, but it was in desperate need of salt. Even with salt, it was amazing how flat the blend of mushrooms tasted. The dish is served over \"double-cooked\" polenta. I'm not a fan of corn meal mush to begin with. Frying it after the initial cooking process is fine, but this version was dense and tasteless. When I order the signature dish at a restaurant, I expect to be blown away. That was not the case with this mediocre mushroom melange. Frankly, the Sauteed Mushrooms side dish at Durant's is better because those mushrooms are well-season and not enveloped in a sauce that masks the nuances of their individual flavors. The portion was more generous and the BF and I split reasonable servings for the price of this item.

The BF decided to go with the Rib-eye special ($40) as his entree. It was a huge portion with a full pound of steak. The meat was nice, but it was way too aggressively seasoned. A piece of quality meat does not need to be overwhelmed with spice. The rib-eye came with what was described as a sweet potato hash. Coincidentally, the BF makes a superb sweet potato hash that is on the order of caramelized sweet potato home fries. The version at Cowboy Ciao was really lumpy mashed sweet potatoes with nothing approaching the texture of a hash. There is no excuse for lackluster side dishes.

I ordered the Slow-Roasted Short Ribs ($31). The portion of meat was generous, but not enormous like the BF's steak. I liked the dried cherry BBQ sauce that was presented on the side. The meat was fork-tender and made even more delicious when dipped into the tangy sauce. The side dishes were again disappointing. The pecan grits were utterly flavorless and the pan-fried vegetables needed seasoning. Hiding the vegetables under the huge lump of grits was a less than stellar presentation.

Our meal was not thrilling. Since that it what the restaurant aims to achieve, it was a disappointment. When we have a hankering for this genre of food again, we'll make our way to The Roaring Fork.

Ciao, Cowboy Ciao."}
{"text":"We came with a large group and the waitstaff was fantastic. The atmosphere was casual but a bit loud. The appetizers and main dishes were inventive but some missed the mark a bit by trying to blend too many components (duck confit was good, the cornbread underneath it was good, together they were awkward). The chopped salad is an amazing dish, but the menu doesn't give you any idea what it is. 
Drinks were good, but the wine list was an unused gimmick. 

Dessert was hyped by the staff, but completely fell flat. Our table had a bit of everything on the menu and none of them stood out. One of them was a disaster (birthday cake), the \"famous\" bread pudding was dry. Ice cream flavors were exotic, but the duck fat ice cream tasted like soapy coconut. 

All in all, a really good choice, but missing on a few spots."}
{"text":"Yeah the chopped salad is awesome...was happy to see it on the Valentines menu.   Nice place for a special day, wish the service was special.  Wasn't bad, but more of an Applebee's type experience.

And then, in the dimly lit restaurant I look closely at the bill, and there in tiny print is a gratuity added.  For a party of 2.    C'mon Cowboy Ciao...  I had to wonder how many people tipped a full tip on top of that.

Ehhhh.  Was just OK."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic for airport food. It is prepared with dignity. The people who work here seem to truly care about the food/drinks they provide. 

If you have time to sit down for a meal at the airport and you are in Phoenix... This place is a no- brainier. 

Welcomed surprise during my travels."}
{"text":"Came to try the chopped salad as recommended by some locals. I got smoked salmon salad my aunt got the chicken.  Both were delicious."}
{"text":"Oh Cowboy Ciao..how I miss thee! It doesn't better than a Stetson Chopped and a glass of wine. Oh, and the mushroom pan fry and desserts aren't bad either."}
{"text":"Had reservations for a wed early evening dinner and glad we did...the restaurant was quite busy by quarter to six. Friendly, attentive and prompt service that was respectful to our kids.

Appetizers: Husband and I shared buffalo capriaccio and tiger shrimp.  Both were fabulous.  We'd been duly warned by other reviews that the plates are small, so we weren't surprised (only 4 shrimp). Re tiger shrimp: we would have tolerated it spicier considering the habanero but no complaints, as the flavor came through nicely.  I thought the crostini were a bit too hard but it didn't spoil the dish a bit.  

Dinner selections: Pork rib chop and Puerco Lento (neither of us usually order pork but apart from the mushroom choice, these two seemed like the least similar to what is available where we usually dine out)  Fabulous.  Moist and flavorful.  The Puerco reminded me a bit of carnitas, but the starch (fingerling potatoes) and sauce (creme) distinguished it.

Dessert: bread pudding and cobbler.  The bread pudding was nice, and we concluded we should have ordered two of them instead of trying the cobbler.  The cobbler was of strawberries, blueberries,and raspberry sauce, and served with honey ice cream that to me, tasted mostly like vanilla.  The bread pudding was served with brown butter ice cream.  The brown butter ice cream was my favorite part of dessert but my husband disliked it intensely for its unusual flavor.  To me, it was like a mouthful of butter, brown sugar, and candied pecan...much better than the LA food truck focused on gourmet ice cream.

I agree with a previous post about the tables being uncomfortably close together.  The only plus here is that we didn't worry about our young children's volume because the nearby table was loud!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place after all the great reviews, but unfortunately I could really only give it three stars.  

First problem--they couldn't find our reservation in the computer when we arrived at 9pm.  I'd called earlier that day around 4pm, and they said 2 people at 9pm was no problem.  We never did find out what the problem was, but someone may have said that they'd put us down for the wrong day?  Anyway, they apologized for the misstep and suggested that we have a drink at the bar while waiting for the next available table.  Comping one drink would have been a nice touch.  Not crucial, but a nice touch.  Alas, nothing was comped.  We waited about a half hour, and then were finally seated.

Waiter was initally friendly and accessible, and helped us out w/ deciding how  many small plates to order between the two of us.  We ultimately decided on the mini mushroom  pan fry, the famous stetson chopped salad, buffalo carpaccio, and the scallops w/ beet risotto.  

Salad and carpaccio came out first, and both were absolutley excellent.  Salad was the perfect amount for two people, with a ton of flavor.  Carpaccio was equally good, and well-seasoned.  I'd recommend both dishes completely.  

There was quite a long delay before we received our second two orders, with the waiter nowhere in sight.  Finally the mushroom dish and the scallops arrived.  I had very high expectations for the mushroom dish, and it dissapointed.  It was extremely spicy, to the point that it masked all the other flavors, and there was entirely too much sauce happening on the plate.  Mushrooms themselves were well cooked, but again, not much flavor because of all the spice.  Now, I'm a self-admitted wuss when it comes to spice, but even the boyfriend who likes spice thought it was too much.  It just seemed like an odd dish to be so spicy.  I do realize that the description indicates ancho cream, but still, was too much.  Scallops were overcooked and the risotto (normally one of my favorite dishes ever) was bland.  Very little beet flavor.  Waiter disappeared again for quite awhile while we were waiting for the check.  Service just sort of melted down throughout the night.  

To recap--first half of the meal was excellent.  Second half was sub-par.  I should probably go with two stars, but that salad was so good that it brings the whole place up another notch."}
{"text":"Great group dinner!!
The table got:
Stetson with Chicken & Avocado
Stetson with Salmon & Avocado
Crab Enchiladas 
Tiger Prawns 
Short Ribs
Pork entree ( can't remember the real name)
Small Mushroom plate
Peanut butter bar
Bread pudding 
Cereal killer

Oh My Yum!!!!

Everything!"}
{"text":"Eating here now and had to write this review. The Salmon entree (bottom right side of menu) is crazy good. It's salmon over arugula and a bunch of other goodness like avocado and pumpkin seeds and roasted crispy corn. Soooo good. Do not pass go, do not collect $100, just try this place. Also a decent wine selection. P.S. Their smoked salmon Stetson salad is also amazing!"}
{"text":"Better than most of the airport food; got the chop and it was almost as good as the Scottsdale location. Knowing they can only source through approved airport vendors they do a good job recreating their signature salad."}
{"text":"I had a friend in town from LA, to whom I've been raving Cowboy Ciao for years.  It did not disappoint, it never does!  

I'm still dreaming of the 4 appetizers that we shared instead of entrees.  One of the most amazing meals I've ever had to this day.... the Mini Mushroom Fry; the Jumbo Prawns; the Albacore-ke bowl, and of course the famous CHOP SALAD.  After tasting each dish, there is no way I could choose from just one.  Each was INCREDIBLE!  
(ps - Let them serve everything exactly as they do, they are food geniuses!)

Our waitress could not have been more perfect.  She was also a chef and chatted food & wine with us each time she stopped by our table.  It was a lot of fun!  She made the experience even more enjoyable.

They have a great wine menu.  In fact, she recommended a delicious dry white wine, that I wish I had written down. 

Every time I dine at Ciao, I enjoy a new memorable & mouth watering experience.  Along with the super yum food, there is also something about the vibe in this place that is very inviting.  My Angeleno friend visits often, just to eat Ciao!  :) Love love love!!!!! Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I was there to pickup some smoking pipes, at Ford and Fifth, review coming soon.
I finished my business, asked a local person for a recommendation, he told me about this place, a few blocks from where I was.  Went there with a friend, and to my surprise, great food.  When he first mentioned this place, I thought Cowboy Chow, not Ciao, so I was pleasantly surprised.  I had a lunch portion of scallops over some risotto, brown, with an added twist on this.  The scallops were very tasty, a bit firm, but still great, I also had a craft beer, housed in bourbon barrel, great.  My friend had a turkey sandwich, but it had grilled red peppers, cucumbers, excellent, and the very thin homemade fries, great.  The place has great ambience, I highly recommend you visit this place when your in the Scottsdale area."}
{"text":"Cowboy Ciao was an overall great dining experience! 

A group of six of us grabbed some late-night eats here immediately after a four-hour flight into the city. Our server was fantastic-- although we arrived less than two hours before their closing time, she greeted our group with much enthusiasm and satisfied all our curiosities about their menu highlights and extensive wine list. The atmosphere is classy, warm, and inviting-- a perfect date night spot!

Although I limited myself to a bowl of soup, I was able to sample some of my group's picks, which included The Stetson Chopped Salad (phenomenal), truffled mac & cheese (great!), Buffalo Carpaccio, and the Berkshire Pork Belly (very delicious).

Everyone walked away with a positive dining experience and only great things to say about their food. Next time I'm in town, I'll be returning to this spot!"}
{"text":"Great waiter. Fast food delivery. The hash was just ok. Wouldn't order it again. Short on meat and egg was jelly like. Wiling to try the restaurant again just based on the service alone."}
{"text":"Bad customer service, and very unaccommodating. My daughter is gluten free and they would make zero exceptions to their menu."}
{"text":"Had dinner at Cowboy Ciao last night and the food was outstanding.  We had mac and cheese and the Chopped Salad as an appetizer and then fillet Mignon, Hamburger and Korean Short ribs for our main course.  Every thing tasted expectational.  

What is holding me back from giving Cowboy Ciao five stars is the noise level in the restaurant.  there were eight of us at dinner and It was so loud that people at one end of the table could not communicate with the people at the other end.  For that matter it was difficult to speak with the people in front of you.  On two different occasions throughout the evening the waiter did not bring items out that we had ordered because he did not hear our request.  

The decor is great, I would suggest some type of treatment to work on the acoustics so people can have a conversation at dinner. 

This was my first time having dinner here.  I have been there for lunch a few times.  I will stick to lunch where it seems to be a little bit more conducive for visiting."}
{"text":"I've been going to this place since moved to Scottsdale. I've always found it to be a fun place with a contemporary western atmosphere. Today was my last.visit. The surly host was not inviting because of what must have been a hard day.

My guest and I came in for what I had anticipated to be a leisurely birthday lunch. The place was crowded and seating was tight. The table we were shown was cramped. I asked if there was anything else available. The response I got was surly \"This is the only table I have for 2\" with a clear undertone of \" Take it or leave.it\". I left it. There was no statement of something else would be available shortly nor was there any attempt of any sort of accomodation ( have a seat at the bar). I left and called telling the host. I told him that.the vibe I got from him was not befitting the.place I had visited several times before. As a full-time resident of Scottsdale who has recommended this place to visitors and hometown.folks, this incident 
has taken the fond memories of the food and the wait staff away. NEVER AGAIN will I patronize this place.  
Thanks host for making what should have been a pleasurable experience and making it one where it's clear you need to think how you interact.with customers via words and attitude."}
{"text":"The staff was amazing. Super helpful and fast. They earned the three stars. 

The restaurant closed its kitchen Before I arrived at 8:45pm so I didn't eat. I felt like that's a little early.  Besides that my beer was warm."}
{"text":"Had an hour to kill before our flight so we came in here on Friday afternoon.  Service was ok and the food was palatable just nothing to get excited about.  Booths are very comfy though so I'd recommend grabbing one of those if you stop in here."}
{"text":"I have to say I am a fan! The Stetson Chopped salad has got me hooked on this place. I literally get it go once a week! I have taken pretty much everyone I know here just to get this salad! 

The Exotic Mushroom Pan Fry is also a great choice! If you still have a sweet tooth at the end of your meal definitely try the Apple Cobbler with brie cheese crema and duck fat ice cream! WOW its truly amazing and so different from any apple cobbler I've ever tasted. 

The service here is always great and they are friendly and quick!"}
{"text":"I wonder when this place can get it right.  My first time here a couple months ago I had a hard time ordering some food to go to the point the restaurant mgr got upset with the bartender.  Today I stopped in for a beer.  And I had to make about 5 choices before had to settle on a beer I don't drink.  Out of Bud Light no keg on Sam Adams then the draft system is down.  Really?   Busy airport.  Please for the love get it together.  Without excuses"}
{"text":"I have frequented this restaurant over many years, including bringing large private parties for dinner. Food was always exceptional. Today, was a major disappointment. My son, husband and I had brunch/lunch. Food took quite awhile, and when it arrived was barely warm. Son had waffles with fried chicken. Bourbon maple butter had no bourbon or maple flavor. I had buffalo style shrimp with blue cheese grits. Looked more like an app than entree. Shrimp ok, grits cold with no blue cheese flavor. Husbands chicken wrap was boring and uninspired. Sad to see such a great restaurant go downhill."}
{"text":"A fantastic restaurant with excellent ambiance, food, service and cocktails.  I can't think of a single flaw of my last meal here, and so I can't possibly give them anything less than five stars.  If you have guests coming in from out of town, make sure to bring them here - it's cuisine that will keep folks talking."}
{"text":"For me it would be more like 3.5 but when it comes to round up, I guess CC deserves the upgrade.

We ordered everything to the center, as one of our friends likes to say, \"sharing is Karing (typo intended, local joke :)

We had the pork chop, the mushrooms, the porkbelly, mac and cheese, and flat iron steak. 

All the dishes were pretty good. The mushrooms had avocado that was ripe and firm (hard to find a good avocado and they nailed it).

The pork chop was kind of dry, hard and lacked flavor. The flat iron steak was good but a little salty.

The pork belly and mac and cheese were pretty good. 

Good wine (pinot noir from Oregon at 15 a glass).

So the food would be a solid 4 stars (specially because it wasn't like crazy expensive considering each one had 2 drinks of our party of 3). What I didn't get is why to put so much stuff in a good dish? All the garnishes were plain and uneventful.

The decor and setting doesn't go with the food, from my point of view. We were sitting like in the middle, by the bathroom and the kitchen divided by an ugly curtain.

The service was OK.

All in all, a good place."}
{"text":"Best airport food I've ever had. Better than most regular restaurants too!  Salads are super fresh and flavorful!"}
{"text":"The asiago ciabatta bread is awesome, the food was well prepared, the staff was perfect"}
{"text":"I have always loved this place!!! It is in the heart of Old Town Scottsdale next to the Canal area.  If you are into wine this is the place to go!! They have a very extensive wine selection and the staff is well versed in helping your way through the large \"binder\" (it is actually not a binder it is nicer than that but for lack of other words it is easier to picture how big it is).  They are famous for their Stetson chop salad which can be served with salmon or chicken.  It is the best chop salad I have experienced in the valley.  Now lets move on to the scallop dish.... WOW!  It is very rich but I crave it!  It is served with beet risotto a dill cream sauce as well as a few other wonderful additions that complement the dish.  Also if you are looking for good carpaccio as in the meat not fish realm, here's the end to your search.  I am a true lover of beef carpaccio and here they have a separate delicacy; buffalo carpaccio!!!!!  I could go on but I suggest you check it out for yourself."}
{"text":"Chopped salad is legit!  Mushroom dish and pork chop were phenomenal! Max is an amazing server, you can tell he has such a good heart. You will know what I mean when you meet him ;)"}
{"text":"Wow, this place is not nearly as good as remembered. The food was the problem, uninspired and one dish was just plain awful.
We had the wild mushroom dish that is served over polenta. On the menu is sounded delightful. It arrived with a sauce over it that tasted like a cube of butter was just melted into it. That sauce obliterated any flavor from the mushrooms and after a few bites just felt heavy. I only had a few bites before passing it to my husband who ate a few more bites before giving up on it. That dish sat in our stomachs like lead.
We also ordered the chicken fried trout - never would have ordered that if we knew ho heavy the mushroom dish was. The fish was crispy but basically flavorless with a slaw that was underdressed and also flavorless. A nice pop of acid in that slaw would have done wonders.
I still like the look of this place, but the lighting is so dark one has to wonder what one would see with the lights up. Not a pleasant thought.
The service was good, so no fault there."}
{"text":"I only tried one plate and it was awesome!  The person working behind the bar was great, the owner spent the time to talk to me about what she'd recommend.  They recommended the exotic mushroom deep fry and it was as good as any vegetarian meal I've ever had.  I recommend getting the bread with it for dipping.  I will be coming back here when I'm in town again."}
{"text":"Great food, excellent wine selection....makes you forget you're in the airport. Will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Reservations don't seem to mean much as the host/manager seemed annoyed when we arrived on time.  Then took is to the worst,  darkest table in the place and got super pissed when we asked to be moved.  Last few visits the food hasn't been very good, so when the service declines what's the point."}
{"text":"This will blow you away. Take my word for it... the Stetson Chopped Salad is a treat."}
{"text":"The service and chop salad was the only great thing here. We were very disappointed with the exotic mushroom and lamb chops. Both items were bland and over cooked. Speaking of over cooked our bruschetta was nearly burnt and we could taste that more than the toppings. Unfortunately I won't come here agin for the chop salad and I would rather go to the gladly for the same thing plus other delicious items!"}
{"text":"Always a fave. 

Last night we stopped in before a party and we had a wonderful meal once again. 

We shared the All-American Cheese Platter and the Chicken & Waffles. The latter was a complete splurge but I'm glad we tried it. I've tried making fried chicken with rice flour and never quite achieved the crunchiness that these had. YUM. Corn waffles? Sign me up!! There was sage involved too....ooooh it was good. 
Next we shared the Pork Ribeye that was wow & scrumptious rolled into one. Cooked to medium it had some pink but the taste was out of this world! And umm....came with a side of Mac & Cheese. Yeah so I was naughty all night but naughty tastes gooooooood. 
Last, we shared the bread pudding - very good but the icecream was even better!

Portion sizes here are quite large, I arrived on an empty stomach & there's no way I could have eaten an entree on my own! I know many think more for their money but really, when it's cooked that wonderfully you only need what you body can take!! Sharing like that was great & I wan't overstuffed for drinks at that party later on. 

Also had a cucumber drink - cannot remember the name! It was cold, frothy & refreshing. Not too strong & summery enough for it to be a perfect addition to the cheese platter. 

Cowboy Ciao is the place we hit when we can't decide on where - last night has proved once again they know what they're doing."}
{"text":"We ended up eating here due to lack of options at the last minute. My first reaction to the menu was holy cow, $27-38 for an entree?! That led us to order off their grazing and out of the box menu. I actually prefer orderly a bunch of smaller dishes so I can sample a variety of things.

Prok Barbacoa - not worth getting. Yes, it was tender and juicy but not flavorable at all. I wish it had more of the stone fruit chamoy toppings or something. The sweet potato/almod patata the pork was sitting on what not memorable either. We didn't really taste anything that made it stand out. Only reason why we even noticed it was because we cut into it while splitting the plate.

Brushetta Duet - I'm glad this dish was only $5. I would've been pretty upset if it was more. Two of the four bruschetta pieces were charred. Why would you even serve it? It doesn't cost that much to replace the pieces... 

Truffled 'Mac n' Cheese' - Winner! This was the only dish we ate that left us both craving for more and even fighting for the last bite. The mac and cheese is topped with broken potato chips and you'll find hidden pancetta pieces. Must try!!!

Berkshire Belly & Waffles - good and different? If you've had roasted pork from the Chinese BBQ stores it tastes very similar. You have to eat the pork and waffles together. The items by themselves didn't work. The dish comes with maple butter but it wasn't needed I don't think.

I have mixed feelings about coming back... maybe just for a drink and mac n cheese."}
{"text":"Stopped by this place after seeing it on a walk, made a night out of it for a birthday. We arrived before they got busy, so our lack of reservation wasn't an issue and we were seated immediately. Seriously impressive wine menu; their website's claim to \"wine bible\" was justified. The bruschetta was nothing to write home about, their mushroom pan fry was tasty, but had a bit too much filler. The meat on the \"Smoke, Sugar, Shank\" was cooked perfectly, but the beans were cold and tasteless and the whateverelse it came with wasn't memorable. The highlight of the night was definitely the desserts. The birthday cake of the night was a dark chocolate raspberry affair, and the taste was divine, even if the seeds added to an unusual texture. We sampled the ice cream trio with Orange Blossom, Chocolate Chunk, and Pickled Watermelon, and were extremely pleased. Three scoops of ice cream on a plate didn't seem enough to justify a $10 price tag, but with places like this it's to be expected. The desert wine was lovely after they filtered the cork out of my first glass. All in all a good meal, punctuated by occasional disappointment."}
{"text":"Rating for rudeness.  Walked up to the to go cooler at 8:55pm on 8/25, there was a ton of sandwiches etc inside.  A guy walked up and put a board over it telling me they're closed...  Gee, thanks, it would have taken literally 30 seconds to ring me up..."}
{"text":"This restaurant was delish.  I got the side salad and the mushroom pan fry. Both were really flavorful. Would definitely eat here agian!"}
{"text":"So I made it in to this charming restaurant today, and had to order the famous Stetson salad, and yes, it was very good. Personally, I actually preferred the Testosterone salad, and I think that salad doesn't get nearly enough play. The steak strips were like a little piece of carnivore heaven. So tasty, juicy, and ridiculously tender. Prices were a bit steep. 50 bucks for 2 salads, a glass of wine and an iced tea. Regardless of price, next time I go, I'm SO ordering a big juicy steak. 
Great people-watching spot right in Old Town, and the place had cute character. 
Nice place to take visitors from out of town."}
{"text":"I have been here three times and all three have been great experiences!!  I have always ordered the the mini Exotic Mushroom Pan Fry ..because after trying it the first time I was there..I just can't get enough!  Soooo yummy!  Very nice ambiance....great service...and probably the largest wine selection I have ever seen!  Love this place!"}
{"text":"It's no secret that I love cowboys. I love anything that has to do with cowboys. One day, I will make a cowboy mine...*ok calming down now* So the decision to dine at Cowboy Ciao was a no brainer! 
Next, I need to scold myself: WHY haven't I been to Cowboy Ciao for a meal before??? BAD Dottsy! BAD! Moving on... 

I visited CB's with two friends and didn't know I was going to be hit upside the head with some REALLY. GOOD. FOOD. We were greeted and seated immediately, which was quite a surprise for a Friday night, but there was a table just about to leave so we lucked out. 

I decided on having the special of the evening which was the Harris Ranch Rib-eye with creamy spaghetti squash. My dear Yelpers, I dream about the dish to this day! I had it perfectly rare which made me a very happy Diva! The spaghetti squash was perfectly cooked and perfectly creamy. It was amazing! I am batting my eyelashes blissfully as I type these words. 

We also split a dessert that was equally delicious, but I don't remember exactly what it was. I do remember a chocolate cup filled with a peanut butter mousse. Fab! Oh wait! How could I forget the cup of chocolate with chili mixed in? Again, another GREAT dessert...

So why not 5 stars? I have yet to return to CB and you all know I don't give it all away on a first date! I excitedly await my next visit to Cowboy Ciao. The food was masterfully prepared and I enjoyed my entire visit!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast I have had in an airport.  Breakfast enchiladas are amazing and the bacon was cooked perfectly."}
{"text":"Food was very good.  The service however was very unprofessional!!!  To start with, the bartender must have had a really bad day, because she had NO INTEREST in taking an order, smiling, or doing anything other than physically delivering a drink.  Didn't ask if we wanted water, or anything.  At least she made my drink correctly, so I will give her credit for that.

Hostess - when customers walk in, with a reservation 45 minutes early - and notices 7 tables all empty (on a Monday night), you cannot say that all tables are taken and we have to wait at the bar - only to sit us 15 minutes later at one of those empty tables!!  Did you honestly think that we didn't see that table empty when we walked in?

Please learn from this.  The whole restaurant should not suffer from a few unprofessional people"}
{"text":"Not your typical airport food... this was a welcome relief to a frequent travelers palate.   

Highly recommended if you have a few $$'s leftover from your travels and a layover!!"}
{"text":"I was expecting something really amazing as Cowboy Ciao is highly touted.  While the salads are quite tasty, the wagyu burger and the Korean ribs I had other times were just average especially for the price."}
{"text":"The cereal killer dessert is an oatmeal cookie pizookie with frosted flake ice cream and caramel sauce. One of the best desserts I've ever had! Great service as well."}
{"text":"Food was decent, but the wine service and specifically the know it all bait and switching snob of a somm will ensure I never return.

Went in anticipating a great dinner and a great bottle of wine, poured over the wine list with my partner and found several great bottles...that were all mysteriously out of stock.

You have a 200 page wine list that the server laughingly refers to as a 'novel' and somehow everything I picked is out of stock?

The somm came over and recommended a bottle I'd never heard of, but insisted it was similar to the things I'd picked.

It wasn't, I knew from the second the server popped the cheap composite cork.

When I got home I looked it up - a $12 bottle that they'd charged me $44 for. I hope the profit was worth it, I'll never be back."}
{"text":"Great service. $7 for mac and cheese. Not very impressive. Wish it had more flavor. Shpuld have stuck to the McDonald's idea."}
{"text":"Mushrooms and stetson salad are a must any time visiting AZ!  Great food, wine, and atmosphere!  Top 5 in AZ!"}
{"text":"So I order the wrap and was not expecting the spicy part (totally my fault) and I simply am NOT a spicy food person. The bartender recognized that and took it off of my bill with no guilt trip! THAT is customer service and THAT is what is missing in the restaurant business. I am so glad I decided to come here and will definitely frequent this place because of the outstanding experience."}
{"text":"It is all about the Stetson Chopped Salad! You get a choice of chicken, smoked salmon or avocado.  I went avocado and licked my plate clean.  Well, kinda.  Almost.. I am a lady.  Sometimes. lol. 

The wine list was above par for an airport spot and all the bartenders were amazing.  Nice ambiance and a friendly vibe all around.  All smiles. Aaaaaand power outlets everywhere! Seriously,  2-3 for every seat.  Brilliant.  Who doesn't need to charge their phone/laptop/ipad while traveling??? 

The name is odd to me because it sounds like a BBQ place made a baby w an Italian restaurant....when really it is New American/Southwest-ish.  Who really cares what the name is though? Definitely one of my fav airport spots.  Hats off."}
{"text":"I think for this review I'll try a pros/cons format:

Pros:
-The service was great! When we said we had to be at our gate in 10 minutes to begin boarding, our server boxed up our quesadilla without us even asking, which was very helpful. 
-The food was very good- we got two appetizer quesadillas and one member in our party got the mixed green salad. The salsa served with the quesadilla was fresh and flavorful, and the quesadilla itself was quite good. 

Cons:
-Not-so-great prices. 1/2 a medium/large quesadilla cut into four slices was $14. To be fair, it's an airport restaurant, but even so, it was pretty small for those standards, which was why we ordered two. 
-Loud atmosphere: I realized just how loud it was after walking out. 

Final take: Yes, I would probably come here again if ever in the Phoenix airport, because the food was really good."}
{"text":"Yummy slow cooked pork with pasta, green chile, roasted corn, black beans , cojita cheese and cilantro.  They had it ready for me in 10 minutes and packaged it to go so I wouldn't miss my flight.  Great service and delicious dish!  Recommended!!"}
{"text":"I want to give places the benefit of the doubt. Especially ones that have positive reviews, have been recommended by locals and have been around awhile even with heavy competition close by and a fairly pricey menu. So when our first round of drinks took 15 minutes to arrive, and our old fashioned was made incorrectly (a place like this with an expansive bar should know how to make an old fashioned, yes?), I reminded myself that the food was supposed to be awesome. We were on vacation, with good friends and were prepared to have a great evening so I really was not looking to spoil it for myself. 

And then our waiter opened his mouth. I asked for some explanation of menu items, many of which had either no explanation or description or was a puzzling mess of adjectives and much-too-hip-and-cool titles.  When asked for some help to decipher parts of the menu that - while it appeared to be in English - might as well have been written in a foreign language, our waiter started in with a host of racist remarks - like maybe he could find his Vietnamese friend to interpret for me, or go get me some dim sum instead. When I didn't laugh, he asked what I wanted an explanation of but I was so over it. He returned to the table after a few minutes, likely feeling slightly remorseful about his inappropriate comments (or more likely trying to resurrect his shrinking tip potential) and started rattling off at 100mph a verbal dissertation of a few menu items. No one at our table could understand much of what he said. I guess he was having a bad night and unfortunately it did rub off some on us. One bright star was the manager who came by to drop off a list of breakfast and lunch places he wanted to recommend after having had a conversation about this with our friends before our arrival. We did not mention our waiter - no one wanted to have a negative conversation and further spoil what was supposed to be a fun evening.  

As for the food, well, it's hard to be fair given the bitter palate created by the waiter. I had the mini mushroom pan fry (serious potential, but slightly greasy and sadly under salted) and a salad (which was \"fine\"). My husband had the swordfish (butter sauce was yummy), our friends the bison meatloaf and the filet mignon. Both were pretty good. Desserts earned higher praise, allowing me to move Cowboy Ciao up to 2 stars - bread pudding, ice cream trio and the birthday cake were all delicious and a satisfying end to an otherwise disappointing experience. 

I would not recommend Cowboy Ciao to anyone visiting the Scottsdale - there are too many fabulous restaurants in this area to waste time with poorly trained staff."}
{"text":"Cowboy Ciao is one of my favorite things about visiting Scottsdale! Every time I've been there I've had an unforgettable experience. Food is an amazing balance of funky and phenomenal. Wine list is extensive and service has never been short of fantastic. I can't stop thinking about the ahi filet the size of my head so so good. Can't wait for my next trip to AZ."}
{"text":"You will be happy you came here. I am always skeptical of restaurants that try and serve too many types of cuisine but this restaurant actually impressed me for airport food.  In fact, I don't feel like I am eating in an airport restaurant at all! I ordered the steak salad and the portion was generous and it was delicious. The waitstaff actually seemed to care about me as a patron and the service is good."}
{"text":"Tried the Stetson Chopped Salad (Good) an interesting and tasty mix of items. I Also tried the Truffled Mac n Cheese, Wow - this was fantastic (Best Mac n Cheese I've ever had!) and the Corn Nut Scallops (Good) cooked perfectly - had to get use to the Corn Nut crunch. Overall a good meal!"}
{"text":"Try the chopped salad. It's awesome!  Good place to stop if you need a quick bite."}
{"text":"Great food!  Buffalo meatballs with truffle oil are to die for!  Excellent  margaritas & wine list.  Atmosphere is fun yet sophisticated."}
{"text":"How have I lived in the Valley for more than 40 years and not had this Stetson chopped salad?! Omg! The best salad ever.  My mom and sister and I shared it as an appetizer and it was perfect. The service here at lunch is great. Our entrees were incredible. My mom had the scallops, I had tiger prawns over elote, and my sister had pork over polenta. We loved everything. Too full for dessert but the dessert menu looked amazing. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I really think they are going to shut down. It seems they have hired new servers just until their lease expires. Doesn't seem that they care anymore about the menu, food or service. Just getting by until doors close...? That's all that makes sense for the poor reviews in the past couple months.  --Here's my honest/unbiased review... Wanted to like it. Has good reviews, not sure why. Maybe people are just afraid to give an honest review...? Always want to give good reviews, not bad, but wished someone would have warned us and why I'm doing this review. Maybe just a bad night...? Dennis behind the bar was personable, drinks were good, but took WAY too long per drink. We suspected he was new...? There was literally only one other customer at the bar, no reason for the long wait. And why no one else at the bar on a Saturday night? Our appetizer, Burrata & Tomato Salad, literally came with one half of a cherry tomato...only one half of one, tiny, little, cherry tomato. We thought they must have forgotten the tomatoes, so we asked. Rob brought us four more halves of the smallest cherry tomatoes you've ever seen. We asked him to please take back the uneaten burrata that lacked tomatoes. We apologized for being, \"so picky,\" but did clarify that the menu does say, \"Burrata Tomato Salad.\" We were cool about it, not a big deal, maybe just out of tomatoes for the evening...? When we left, we went out of our way to say, thank you and to make sure they (Dennis/bar tender and Rob/server) were good...not the other way around...? Then, after we left, we realized that they bumped us from our opentable.com reservation, marked our account as a \"no show.\" Really...? We spent $70 on drinks and an appetizer and tipped them 20%, not cool. Called Rob and he apologized for his \"new hostess that didn't know what she was doing\" and he did reverse our opentable reservation status. Thank you, but don't throw your cool hosted under the bus. She made us feel most welcome. Wish I knew her name. Very friendly upon entering. Making sure she would check us in on opentable.com even if we sat at the bar. She made us feel very well taken care of. Wish they were all like her! --Ended up at Citizen Public House where we were well taken care of with amazing food and drinks as usual."}
{"text":"With every bite of my breakfast enchilada I would forget I was in the middle of my 2.5 hour layover having breakfast at an airport eatery.   

It took a little longer than I like for someone to come over and take my drink order but the waitress made up for it by being very attentive and knowledgeable of the menu.   Very tasty and way above the norm of what you'd expect to get at an airport."}
{"text":"Cowboy Ciao totally let me down during our last visit.  So much so, the manager had to get involved.  We walked into the restaurant a little after 6.  The place was half empty.  However, we were told by the snooty hostess that we had to sit at the bar for cocktails before being seated in 45 minutes.  We were a little frustrated because neither of us drink and it seemed an obvious scheme for them to get more money out of our pocket book.  When we declined her invitation she rolled her eyes and looked away, her counterpart whispered to her and pointed to some open tables.  She shook her head, I can only assume she did not want to accommodate us at the open tables.

We were seated shortly after by the manager.  Though we continued to receive a few glares throughout the evening from the hostest and one of her little friends we saw her whispering to after our encounter.  I eventually had to switch seats with my BF so I didn't have to witness their stares.  Sheesh.  This was unreal, you would have thought I made out with her high school boyfriend. 

As for the food, I ordered the chop salad again, as well as the tomato red pepper soup.  Now this may sound weird but when I tasted the soup, it took me back to an old family friend's farm.  When my BF asked how I liked it, I told him it tasted like cows.  He tried it and agreed.  It almost had a hay-like aftertaste.  I still ate it and I'm still perplexed by it's flavor.   

Regardless, most of my experiences have been better than this and I'm really hoping that this visit was just a fluke.  I'm sure at some point we will try this restaurant again but to be honest, I'm not anxious to run back like I once was."}
{"text":"I thought I already reviewed Cowboy Ciao, but apparently not. Actually, I'm really surprised I haven't gushed for pages about this place already because it's frickin' awesome.

I hate to sound like a foodie asshat, but the menu at Cowboy Ciao is truly inventive. Peanut Butter Chocolate Bacon Brittle (for Dessert)and Blue Cheese Bread Pudding Pork Chops (main course) are just two of the insanely good things I ate the Cowboy tonight. 

The best things on the menu are the Stetson Chopped Salad (hands down the #1 chopped salad of all time) and the Mushroom Panfry. (I can't explain it, just order it). I have to have both every time I eat here. 

Some people might be freaked out by the menu, but those people suck. So please do not suck and go to this restaurant immediately.

Giddy Up."}
{"text":"Try the pastrami style short rib Reuben!

I have travelled often on business and holidays and have spent a lot of time in airport \"restaurants\".  I have been to Cowboy Ciao a few times now and have always had great service. The food is quite good, especially by traditional airport standards.   The staff is excellent, and they know the menu.

If you are in the Phoenix Airport (terminal 4) you should try Cowboy Ciao.  The Calgary flights depart from here so you sun worshipping Cowtowners are a perfect audience.   

Two coronas and the Reuben were $30.  Not bad for airport pricing.

The steak sandwich is also quite good."}
{"text":"Absolutely atrocious service. I tried to get someone to cash me out and thy said only my server could do it. No one could find my server. I asked if a manager could do it, no he was on break. 15 minutes had passed at this point and I really needed to catch a flight. I asked if any other server could do it and but they said no. Eventually the server comes back and says sorry she didn't know we were in a hurry. This was despite me telling her in the beginning that we were in a hurry and her saying no problem we will make sure you get out on time. Everything else was fine other than this."}
{"text":"This place it fabulous!!  I love this place and the ambiance is awesome! I would not recommend it for young kids...I brought my son here and it was more stressful for me and I didnt feel like I could enjoy it like I normally do...Anyways back to this wonderful restaurant.  First off they have great wine selection...I like to get a wine flight that is sampling of wines...it is delicious!  
Then for a starter you should get the chopped salad to share with the table.  It is pretty spectacular, and its sooooooooo pretty!  It is so funny because I have tried to mimic this salad and I cannot!  My mom has and it was pretty good!  Just try it and let me know what you think!  Another few appetizers that are fantastic are the crab enchiladas, the Tiger shimp, meatballs, the pork belly and the risotto.  If you want you can have those as a meal!  
Now my favorite entree is the mushroom polenta dish!  OMG it is creamy and satisfying.  This is the only entree I get when I go here!  It is just something so different and they have just made this dish soooooooooooooooooooooooo right!!!  I have tried the ribs, but they do not touch this mushroom dish!  They top it off with cojita cheese its amazing! 
Now make sure that you save room for dessert!  The bread pudding is to die for and the blonde brownie nad if you like cobbler theirs is delicious!  You can always share desserts but do not feel bad if you want it for yourself!

 This is a perfect place to go for date night or for a birthday or just because!  Dress nice, but you do not have to wear a suit or anything!  Its fun and I know you will enjoy it!"}
{"text":"If you're like most people, the customer service you receive at an establishment is what will make it or break it for you. The cost of dining out is so exorbitantly high (especially at airports) that you would THINK an emphasis would be placed on customer service, right? Even decent customer service can offer some justification of the money you're doling out for airport food fare. 

For this reason, I usually don't visit a restaurant without first reading the reviews. Cowboy Ciao (Phoenix airport) has received favorable reviews because it does serve pretty decent food and it's a nice place to go for drinks and catch a game or two if you have a long layover. 

What made my experience a negative one was because of the hostess. I'm pretty sure her name was Kimberly. I went there today around 1pm. I was the FIRST of three people waiting in line for a table. When she came to seat us, she immediately grabbed the SECOND guy in line and said, \"Dave, right this way\". HE was even surprised that she skipped me to get to him as evidenced by the look of delighted surprise on his face and his response of, \"Seriously?\" As she marched him to the last available table, I looked back at the THIRD guy in line who shrugged his shoulders and laughed. When the hostess returned, I was fully expecting her to escort me to at least a comparable table but what she said was that there weren't any tables left! Instead, there were high-chaired seats against the wall where you get a beautiful frontal view of all the hustle and bustle going on in the kitchen, while you dine facing away from the TV. (Can you detect my sarcasm? ) I get that you may want to give special treatment to who I'm presuming to be a regular patron but there was absolutely no justification for that. I'm sure Dave would've come back even if you seated him in the kitchen. I, on the other hand, am forming my first impression of the place and that could've cost the restaurant my business as well as whoever else was in line after guy #2. 

So as upset as I was, I took the seat in front of the kitchen because I wanted to give the place a shot despite the unprofessionalism exhibited by the hostess. I ordered the Truffle Mac & Cheese, the Burrata Insalata and the Cornbread Bread Pudding. I enjoyed the Insalata the least but the Mac & Cheese and bread pudding were pretty good. My server James was nice and attentive. Was the food enough to make me return and drop another $37 on food & gratuity after the hostess set the tone for my experience there? Nope. 

I hardly ever write reviews but my experience with the rude hostess at CowBoy Ciao motivated me to write about it. And from now on, I will write reviews for good experiences too because establishments that provide good service should receive a positive shout out."}
{"text":"YUM! I'm always nervous when I stop at a sit down place at an airport. I always expect airport food to be overpriced and under deliver and with many people rushing to their flights sometimes quality is given up for speed. Here at Cowboy Ciao we received some great food, filled water glasses and made our flight with no issues. I grabbed the Stetson Salad because as soon as I saw the pictures on Yelp I had to have it. Anytime I can grab smoked salmon I am in and this salad was perfect. There was couscous, crunch and delicious bites of salmon. I was definitely satisfied after this salad and will be trying to replicate it at home. I also heard the Chicken and waffles were great, but I was too occupied with the salad to even know there were other people at the table. 

If you like colorful and delicious things you should try it!"}
{"text":"Chopped salads are simply amazing! It's my absolute favorite lunch spot! Only reason I knocked one star is because of customer service, however it has been improving! I highly recommend this spot!"}
{"text":"One of the best meals I have had on any vacation.  Cowboy Ciao definitely met my expectations.  
First off the wine list was incredible!  Very, very impressive.  With so many options, we decided to have a wine course pairing.  
We went for a couple of appetizers to share and a dessert along with wine pairings for each dish.  It was a real bargain!  I could not believe how cheap this option was compared to NYC.  when we got the bill, I thought there must have been an error.
We ended up getting the stetson salad (a must! I agree.  There is crack in that salad and i usually am not a salad person at all), the buffalo carpaccio (cut incredibly thin), the crab cakes (yum!), the tiger shrimp (exceptional), the tuna (average), scallops (yum! yum!) and  calamari (very nice).  It was a perfect amount of food, and actually really meant for sharing.  The bread pudding was also to die for.
The staff was really helpful when we needed to change our reservation.  I also loved our waitress, super perky without being annoying and very helpful with offering suggestions and explaining the dishes and wine for each course. 
While Cowboy Ciao claims to be Southwestern and Italian fusion, I would say that it's more like New American.   But, hey it is still very creative yummy tasty food!
Next time I am in Arizona, I will definitely stop by Cowboy Ciao!"}
{"text":"Airport bar restaurants. They have you captive. If you don't want food court fare, you can cool your heels at some place a little more chi-chi.
The decor and menu here appear better than what the actual offerings are. Fortunately I've found another place I truly enjoy in the hub that is the Phoenix airport, so I won't have to bother with Cowboy Ciao again.
Don't get me wrong, the food wasn't particularly bad. But it didn't merit the cash we splashed out."}
{"text":"The first time I came here I enjoyed the food so much that I planned months in advance to eat here for my birthday on November 11th. The time came to make reservations for a family of about 15 (quite a large bill) and we made sure to mention we were bringing my own cake so they can refrigerate it until the end of dinner. Come to find out it is a 3$ charge per person for them to cut my OWN cake??? The manager also made a comment that \"I was lucky to even be able to bring my own cake\" 
This is the most ridiculous thing I have ever heard.. And he would not even budge regarding that the bill was already going to be hundreds of dollars with everyones meal and drinks. 
Easier solution?.. Let me cut my own damn cake and let us save 45$ This restaruant has lost my entire families business including mine."}
{"text":"Lots of good recommendations and reviews about this place, and it didn't disappoint.

Tomato bisque soup - very good tomato flavor without being too sour.  Great starter.

Stetson cobb - really unique and excellent salad.  The buttermilk pesto dressing is really good (I never thought of this combination, but it works great).

mushroom pan fry - one of their signature dishes with 9 different types of mushrooms.  couldn't identify all 9 types.  it was good overall, but i think it needed a little more salt to really bring out the flavor.  Very rich sauce (lots of butter i presume).  Certainly a unique dish.  Tasty and interesting, but I'm definitely more of a meat person.

Pig-n-Pudding - my favorite dish.  Very rich, creamy bed of polenta.  The pulled pork was very tender and tasty.  Extremely flavorful dish, uniquely prepared.

The menu/dishes are certainly unique, and very tasty.  My only critique is that the dishes are extremely rich and heavy, which is good every now and then.  I'm not sure that their menu is one which you can eat every day, but then again, most people don't go to the same restaurant every day.

If you're in oldtown scottsdale, definitely check out this place, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"My favorite place to eat in PHX the only reason for 4 not 5 are the prices 
Never a disappointing meal 
Grilled prawns today but the testosterone salad is awesome too"}
{"text":"Fantastic meal!  The pastrami style short rib is a unique flavor combination, with a very generous helping.  The crab enchilada appetizer was a great way to start.  The cocktails were a unique Southwest twist on tradition favorites.  The service was outstanding, even on a busy Saturday night.  An Old Town Scottsdale institution that never disappoints!"}
{"text":"What to say about this gem of fine Scottsdale dining. We had a dinner party here and we did not know what to expect. Our server was eager to get this party going, but we were not in any rush.. in fact, we took in Europeanly slow. 

The drinks was very pretentious, and very good. I usually prefer less pretentiousness but when in Rome.. We had a talk to the sommelier regarding the wine choice for all even if we all ordered different dishes. After short debate we made our choice, and it was great. We wanted an Arizona wine, but they were out so we retreated back to a French concoction that we enjoyed in the mannerisms of true cognoscenti.

Strange things are that they have linens on the table, but paper covering the linen. I must say that this does give the unnecessarily cheap impression. Odd for an establishment that take so much pride in the rest of its appearance. The service is good, but a little hovering for my own preference. I was surprised how mixed the makeup of the patrons were. Thoroughly eclectic and heterogeneous, which is never a bad thing. 

It is a bit loud in here. Our party could still talk, but strangely loud for such a nice place.. and to top it off we had a party next to us with one amazingly loud woman. It's one of those things that you cannot blame the establishment for - and yet, it affects the overall fermata of the ambiance impression.

The tip: Pastrami-Style Smoked Short Ribs was voted by far the best meal that we tried. Very tasty."}
{"text":"This was my first experience and it was quite delightful the wine list was the most extensive I have ever seen. Even though I personally am not a wine connoisseur the rest of my group assured me of this fact. I mean they even will sell you a the wine list as a souvenir! 
Anyways on to the food the most important part! I had the lamb tenderloin which was great the sauce brought out juicy lamb goodness. I tried the sugar shank pork and that was quite good and a large portion. The sides were just ok so that is why this isn't rated higher.
Great spot for a night out in old town especially for the whom love wine. Get the lamb and don't look back."}
{"text":"Nice restaurant in the Phoenix airport. Delicious food, a nice bar to sit at if you're trying to grab a quick drink between flights. Nice booths with windows if you have a little more time to kill. Restaurant is pretty far down the B terminal, so keep that in mind with where your gate is and timing. Overall, a great experience."}
{"text":"My folks had a long layover so we decided to head to Cowboy Ciao for a unique dining experience. I hadn't been there for several years and was really looking forward to getting back. Unfortunately, the staff wasn't nearly as excited to see us. 

From our initial drink order, I could tell it was going to be a disappointing night. The waitress was frustrated with questions about the wine list and we had to ask over and over to have waters filled -- even for the kids. Next, the waitress was visibly put-out when my folks decided to split a dish because they weren't overly hungry. 

To be clear, the food was fantastic. The Pan-Seared Panko-Crusted Halibut and Espresso-Rubbed Filet Mignon were crazy good. For the kids, the Crispy 'Mac n' Cheese' sounded way better then it was, plus it was a little too spicy for our 12 year old (who typically likes a little spice). 

If you're up for great food that is a little over-priced, there are literally dozens of options within walking distance of Cowboy Ciao. It's just not worth spending an hour or more at a place with such lousy service in our opinion..."}
{"text":"I've seen some poor reviews here and I was pretty surprised. I've been here many times and have always had an excellent experience. Whether sitting at a table or at the bar, the service has always been great and the food...forget about it. Topping the charts would be the Stetson Chopped Salad - you honestly can't beat it, my mouth is salivating just thinking about it and the Exotic Mushroom Pan Fry - can I please get this recipe? kthanks.

I will admit that the wait can get lengthy on a busy night but lunch is almost always a breeze and is a perfect location right in the center of Old Town. Oh...and how could I forget the wine list...uhm, yeah - it puts all others to shame. That is all."}
{"text":"Worst service ever. I requested a quesadilla. When I asked the server what was in the quesadilla, she explained how it had beef in it. I asked if I could get it without meat. I was told no, that they would NOT. I said then I'll have to cancel my order. She rolled her eyes and stormed off!! My friends and I just canceled the whole order and walked out. Many more options at the airport."}
{"text":"I had a 2 1/2 hour lay over in Phoenix so I decided to grab some to eat.  As I walked by Cowboy Ciao I really enjoyed the vibe so I went in.  One of the best moves I made on this trip.  I ordered the Scallops, sea scallops crusted with corn nuts and seared, with baby heirloom tomato salad and risotto (as in over-the-top risotto: grilled corn, bacon, butternut squash, Manchego)  I strongly recommend this dish. Very! Very! Good!"}
{"text":"Food blew me away for being at an airport.  I had Thor famous salad with chicken and avocado and it was a great meal to have while waiting at an airport as it wasn't too heavy.  Someone else in my party had the chick n and waffles and she loved them.  The staff was super friendly."}
{"text":"Great food but gone downhill overall. The decor that was once whimsical is now tired and neglected. You will see chipped wall paint that hasn't been fixed in years, and you get a dingy feel overall. Yes the chop salad and some of the food is great. But not enough to ignore the other flaws. Our waitress was nice, but there were some serving incidents. For example, some of my salad had fallen out onto the table, and when she was picking up our dishes--I'm not making this up--she scooped up the pieces of corn and lettuce off the table *with her bare hand* and threw it on the plate. I was just speechless. And then shortly after she handled my credit card. Did she wash her hands? I doubt it. We were grossed out and won't go back. Adios Cowboy Ciao."}
{"text":"My favorite is the Stetson chopped salad. I walk to the B gates every time I'm at the airport to grab one to take with me. Delicious!"}
{"text":"The food and drinks here were yum yum and then some! The Cobb salad was well worth the visit alone... If u try u must buy the Cobb."}
{"text":"I loved the Southwestern influences and the really creative menu, so creative you wonder if it'll work, but everything we ordered did. Just looking at the dessert menu made me wish I could try them all, although \"settling\" for the Red Hot Chocolate (cinnamon/cayenne-spiked pot de creme with chipotle cream) was quite acceptable.

I highly recommend having dinner here the first night of your first-ever visit to Phoenix, as I did."}
{"text":"The food was great and really fast. My husband ordered the Reuben and I ordered the chopped salad. Despite the atmosphere and lackluster service, I almost felt like I wasn't in an airport. Let me reiterate, the salad was really really really good. 

I'm still trying to figure out why I paid $13.50 for a glass of cheap champagne with a drop of bottled orange juice though... stay away from the mimosas. Blah."}
{"text":"We arrived 5 minutes early for our 730pm reservation only to be told we have to wait an additional 20 minutes.  That Tapas Bar across the street looks good right about now."}
{"text":"Great service, If posable request Andy to be server, no regrets. Good food, shirt wait, not expensive and best of all good energy!!"}
{"text":"I like what HMShost is trying to do here by bringing in more up to date attractions/restaurants to combat the negative review in 2012 stating SkyHarbor as one of the worst places to get a bite. 
The hostess was sweet. We opted to sit at the bar, as it was very crowded. After being ignored by the bartender, my husband got up to ask the hostess if we could sit at a recently vacated table. She obliged, just in time too, because after her got up, one of the bartenders left the beer tap on directly in front of his seat and beer started to over flow on to the rail and on to my Husbands phone. I caught it in time. 
At the table, and our server was Jake. He was pretty awkward. Husband ordered the chicken wrap, I ordered Testosterone salad and we split a mac and cheese. Jake turned around before I could tell him how I wanted my steak cooked. Husband ended up liking his wrap. Chips were good. The Mac and cheese was ok. But my steak was borderline still mooing. I sent it back and got the green side salad. Turns out I don't like blue cheese. Or maybe I don't like how much of it was in the salad. Either way, not impressed. My water glass went empty for he second half of the entire meal. And my husbands coke was only filled when the hostess (yes, not the server) asked me if I wanted to send back the salad, then she took my replacement order. 
Go to McDonalds instead....I feel like I say that a lot. And I haven't been to McDs in yrs...so take that for what it's worth. Ha"}
{"text":"This used to be my favorite restaurant in Scottsdale but they have changed the menu options a bit and it's really not my style anymore. The steak was too salty and dry. It's a shame as I used to rave about this place and go 8-10 times a year when I get into town. 

Service is great though and the staff was very good."}
{"text":"Food selection is very \"boooshy\" and servers are way to pushy about there overrated / over priced food.  
Then the server proceeded to take my dish with a spoon and start going through all the ingredients and then stir it all together - just because he liked it that way doesn't mean that's how I wanted it ....... 
Calm down - it's an airport - it's not a five star resturant - it's not a place people are going to be impressed with ur attitude or how u think the food has such \"presentation\" or high quality ..... Get over yourself ........: never ever will I order food here - regardless of how good they think it is......    There a reason the fast food right next to it has a long line and this is the only bar and restaurant that has 25% open seating"}
{"text":"My family and I love this restaurant. I've been many times, for brunch, lunch and dinner and we've always had a very pleasant experience. The food is good, though can be a bit heavy, and the Stetson Salad really is as good as they say it is. They also have a nice drink menu and an extensive wine list. Would recommend, and will be back."}
{"text":"Loved this place during my visit to Arizona, all I can say is STETSON SALAD....YUMMY!!!"}
{"text":"This airport oddity offers a unique menu of delicious items with great, friendly service.  If you're stuck at Concourse B in Phoenix, hit this place up.  You'll be glad you did."}
{"text":"Okay - I went here with the mum and sis. We're not the bar or old town scottsdale types (well, maybe mum was back in her hayday, but the sis and I - we stay away). Really wanted to try this place out and it was fab. Had the Stetson salad, that was cuh-razy good - my sis had some burger she said was \"okay,\" and mum had their mushroom thing (there's only one on the menu, lol) - and that was awesome too. Service was slow, but courteous - they were packed and we did sit at the bar cause we just walked in, no reservations. Atmosphere is \"eh\" - bunch of people who think they're superstahs but they're not, lol so it's a bit overbearing - but worth braving at least once."}
{"text":"I didn't like the name much, but the reviews sounded good. I had the Stetson Chopped Salad with smoked salmon. It was delicious!! The best chapped salad I have ever had! Arugula, dried currants, orzo, pumpkin seeds and smoked salmon with a pesto dressing. It also had air dried corn for color, flavor, and crunch. The mixture of flavors and textures was amazing. I hope I get back to the Phoenix airport again, soon!"}
{"text":"The special stetton salad was great. Crispy corn was a great mix into the salad.  The comes separated and then you need to mix it.

The filet mignon was a good meat, but unfortunately it was a bit burnt and charred.  The meat was flavorful. The potatoes and sides were good."}
{"text":"Excellent service, waiter was knowledgable of the menu and very friendly. Highly recommend the Stetson chopped salad (not your average chopped salad)... unique ingredients, fresh and delish! Can't wait to eat here on my next layover!"}
{"text":"Had the Brushette.  Best Brushette I've ever had, hands down.  Who would've thunk a restaurant could put a bunch of diced crap on a slice of crispy bread and make it taste good? 

Price is about average for airport.  And service was friendly."}
{"text":"Darn good airport food. The bar and some tables have power, and Monday Night Football on TVs. Refreshing layover"}
{"text":"Really good chopped salad. I got it for take out and it was still delicious. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I really liked Cowboy Ciao. The West Coast Wrap was great. The service was excellent."}
{"text":"This place says Scottsdale... you won't find this food anywhere else in the world. Chef Lester leads a team of chefs that are the Bomb-Dot-Com. Gotta have The Salad. It's famous."}
{"text":"We ordered the mac and cheese for an appetizer, which I must say was extremely overrated. It had good texture and flavor, but I guess I expected some sort of revelation. Maybe it was too built up...

Anyway, the wine list was fabulous (we had a delicious Sangiovese), and the entrees were decent. Of course, I had entree envy, as always, and drooled over my brother-in-law's order of Asian style short ribs. They were SO tender. I ordered the mushroom pan fry, which was served over polenta. All in all, it was a good dish. The sauce wasn't so creamy that I needed to be rolled out of the restaurant afterward, and it had a nice level of spiciness (hence the Southwestern edge). My husband's hamburger, however, was mediocre at best. Five Guys is better.

Not sure why other reviewers were griping about the acoustics. I thought the sound level was reasonable, and apparently so did my six-month old son, who slept in his stroller next to me the whole time. Maybe these people went on a Saturday night at a peak time?? If that's the case, they should expect that anywhere, unless they're in a private room. I mean, who do they think they are - Branjolina?"}
{"text":"I usually try to avoid layovers at PHX due to the lack of good food choices.   I tried the cowboy Ciao today and my burger was legit!  Pulled pork on top of a nice hamburger patty. Great service.  The best food choice in PHX airport."}
{"text":"Bartender was cool. One male Wait-staff have ridiculously crap attitude. To the point he wouldn't move out of my way to let me pass by him to my seat; just stared at me as I had to squeeze by him running into other patrons. 
I'd love to hear why personnel like this have jobs."}
{"text":"This was an airport lounge so I wasn't expecting much, but was blown away by the chopped salad! Amazing! I had it with smoked salmon and avocado."}
{"text":"Cowboy Ciao is consistantly excellent, which is surprising, since they own Digestif across the street, which is one of the worst food I have ever eaten....Go figure.  Definitely get the chopped salad side dish/appetizer, and their margaritas are pretty good too!"}
{"text":"Not a fan. The service was okay. The atmosphere was okay. The food not so much. It was pricey and imo bland. We were told it was great causal dinning but I'd disagree. Not somewhere we will give a 2nd chance."}
{"text":"Cowboy Ciao just gets it right. If you've been the the full fledged restaurant before you won't be disappointed with the airport version. The food is on par with the traditional establishment and far exceeds what you would expect to find at an airport. However, with that comes a relatively hefty price compared to typical 'airport food'. If you're ok with paying more to avoid the traditional grab and go Chili's/Applebee's fare then give this place a shot. Restaurant is spacious enough and servers/bartenders recognize that you have someplace to be without bring pushy or rushing you.  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I was in old town Scottsdale today so I decided to find a place to park around 5th Ave and make my way over to Cowboy Ciao for lunch. I ordered the exotic mushroom pan fry one of the signature lunch dishes.

This dish has allot of mushrooms so you need to be a mushroom lover it has cremini, shiitake and grilled portabellini mushrooms the only mushrooms missing in this dish are the psychedelic and hallucinogenic ones. It also has avocado, tomato, cotija cheese with ancho chile cream sauce over double-cooked polenta, I was very impressed this dish was amazing. 

The hostess and waitress where very friendly and attentive throughout the meal so I give this place a 5 star rating for excellent food and attention to detail."}
{"text":"I have eaten just about everything on this menu over the years and keep going back for more. The Stetson Chopped Salad is as fresh as ever while you can't go wrong starting with the Mini Mushroom Pan Fry as an appetizer either.  Both are well complimented with a variety wines from of their over the top wine selection. Although I've enjoyed each dish their, I am always in the mood for their bone in short ribs. They just fall off the bone and melt in your mouth. If you think two or three short ribs can't fill you up, you haven't had this plate of goodness.  (You can never go wrong with their specials either.)"}
{"text":"With out a doubt at one time a place to go. Not anymore, felt dingy, dated, and close to dirty. Decor is interesting, place has not seen paint or a good cleaning in this century. Fixtures are original over twenty years ago and have not been updated or cleaned.

Menu had potential however I ordered Mac and Cheese not a good choice, she ordered a wrap sandwich which we took to go and unrolled it outside so the birds would have lunch. 

Maybe one time but, definitely living in the past.  Needs a good cleaning and update."}
{"text":"It was good overall with some notable dishes like the mushroom fry and mixed drinks.  I didnt care for the pastrami rib.  Also did not think they were helpful enough to the vegan in our group.  For these prices and to compete with the top restaurants in country they shouldnt be so inflexible.  Why not offer the mushroom fry without cream?"}
{"text":"First time at Cowboy Ciao and relied heavily on the waiter who was superb. Good advice on food, attentive, not intrusive.  The wine list was overwhelming so decided to seek some advice, we said we were looking for a wooded chardonnay in the $60 range, the waiter checked and came back with a Patz and Hall suggestion which was the very one we had been mulling over! So put us in the perfect mood. But I am getting ahead of myself. We started with cocktails, we had the minty Wyatt Herb and a cumin laced cocktail that I can't remember the name of, they were amazing and well priced at $10-12 (but then we had just paid $26 for a Singapore Sling at Raffles).  To start we had their signature Stetson Salad and enjoyed it so much we asked for and got the recipe. You have to have it, the smoked salmon and asiago cheese bring out the best in this salad.  We split the Chile Relleno and the Pork Shank, both were superb.  We finished with a flight of home made ice creams, I can't wait to go back. Well done."}
{"text":"Please oh please try the sea stew! Its a meal in itself and may be the best palette pleaser in the valley.

The atmosphere was so so, thrift store finds combined with generic catalog tables and chairs. The staff wasn't particularly friendly but satisfactory. Homemade ice cream and cookies were a treat low on sugar."}
{"text":"Casual atmosphere with friendly service. Very inventive menu. Food is high quality and expertly cooked. Definitely will return to try more onlf their dishes."}
{"text":"Great Food, Drinks and Service..  This is a place were you come casual and feel very relaxed.  I will be back on my next visit to AZ..."}
{"text":"The food here is GREAT!

I've come in three times and have been impressed by pretty much everything. The Pork Belly, the Scallops, the Mushroom Pan Fry, the Stetson Chopped Salad, and the Mac & Cheese are all incredible.  Unlike a lot of other Yelpers, I didn't really like the Short Rib.  

The biggest thing in my book that keeps Cowboy Ciao from being a 5 star restaurant is the service. The first time I came in, our server seemed to be in a bit of a hurry, and showed little to no personality.  During our second visit, service was even worse ... almost warranting a drop down to 3 stars overall.  We waited 15 minutes after our reservation to be sat.  I got up twice to fill waters for my group.  Everything, from straws to lemons to bread, came slowly.  It was very disappointing.  Most recently, our server pointed something out on the menu that we didn't know, and when we told him that was the first time we had heard it, he admitted that a lot of the servers didn't even know about it.  Seems a bit odd.

The food is great, but the service needs attention.  If you can handle that...

ENJOY!"}
{"text":"Seriously? I can't believe how good this place is. The atmosphere is great, although very dressy. The food will blow you away and is pretty high end. A little on the expensive side, but you get what you pay for with this place. The way it is designed is really sweet and makes it easy to spend a lot of time in there. The bar is pretty cool and kinda curves around the center of the place. This is one of the top places to eat in Scotsdale, or Arizona for that matter"}
{"text":"How is it that I've never been here before? This place has been around for quite a while but it wasn't until our annual office Thanksgiving lunch this year that I finally checked it out. Well, the good thing, is, I loved it and I'm definitely going back to try some other menu items. 

It wasn't very crowded at lunch so we had the chance to look around and the place is really well done. I love the funky decorations and would even be comfortable coming back and eating at the round bar by myself. 

After looking at other Yelp reviews I had to try the Exotic Mushroom Pan Fry. Growing up eating morels as a regular dish at my grandparents' house in Michigan I still have trouble thinking of them as an \"exotic\" mushroom, but considering the price they sell for in the stores, I guess they are. The other types of mushrooms included portobello, shiitake, cremini, button, and others. You could definitely taste all the different types and they went extremely well with the polenta cakes. 

Others in my party tried the pastrami, ham & cheese miraviglioso, chicken and waffle sandwich, and the west coast wrap. While I didn't try any samples, everyone was raving about their food.

I'm definitely going back to try the Burger 2.0 which is described as ground buffalo stuffed with duck confit and the Berkshire Pork Belly from the appetizers menu.

Cowboy Ciao definitely gets my vote as a great place to go."}
{"text":"This place is consistently good. Airport food generally sucks this place has really good food and the Bartender is always so friendly. Yay!"}
{"text":"If you're in the Phoenix/Scottsdale area, this is a definite must. Their wine list is over 100 pages long which makes it unreadable, but rest assured that any wine you're looking for, just ask and they'll have it.

That said, the food is incredible and creative and the staff is super friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"I totally love Cowboy Ciao. My first experience was shopping for rehearsal dinner places. We took the grandparents here for lunch and were impressed with the ambiance and food. We chuckled while reading  the fun sayings on the menu. We worked with Nancy to arrange our rehearsal dinner and were very impressed at the service and quality. We had about 35 people and rented out the cowboy room, in the back. All of our guests were pleased with the meal and service. I absolutely love the stetson chopped salad. I can not say enough great things about the salad!"}
{"text":"Here's the thing, I've been here a few times and generally love it.  This particular occasion was a serious disappointment.  I went here with a gf for my birthday, which also happens to be during restaurant week.  We made reservations, and it took 10 minutes of being walked around before we were even acknowledged. Once seated, we ordered our drinks, which took, no lie, 20 minutes to get to the table.  We should have taken it as a sign but the whole experience was kind of shit.  The server forgot to put in parts of our order, it also happened to be the part we were looking forward to the most. The food came out lukewarm at best.  I know Cowboy Ciao prides itself on better, I have personally experienced better but this time was truly suck."}
{"text":"The Stetson Chopped salad is something that has no equal.

If you're from the Phoenix area, or have visited a few times, you've probably run into a similar chopped salad at other restaurants, but Cowboy Ciao was actually the inventor of this yummy treat! So you should definitely try it here first if you want the true AZ Stetson experience.

I hate salmon. With a passion. In fact, I hate most seafood. But the smoked salmon in this salad is seriously delicious! It doesn;t even taste like salmon; it's sweet, slightly smoky, and the texture is similar to a ripe tomato. I know that sounds gross but I swear it's not.

I got my salad to-go before having a girls' night in with some friends, and I ordered it about 5 minutes before I headed out the door to grab it. To my shock and wonderment the salad was ready for me before I walked through the door, even though the hostess told me it would 15-20 minutes! Awesome. The guys behind the bar were efficient with getting me my food, eating utensils, and taking care of my bill. I was in and out in less than 5 minutes.

The salad isn't as good when you're eating it from a box, but it was still delectable. The dressing... to die for. It's a pretty pricey restaurant (I think my salad was around $20 total after taxes and a $2 tip) but I was craving it so what could I do? The only downside to the entire place is the lack of parking, which in my opinion is a big turn-off for this entire area of Old Town. But that obviously has nothing to do with Cowboy Ciao, more so it's just a complaint for me to take up with the local mayor."}
{"text":"Okay....told by many to come here. We had an excellent experience from start to finish. Service was great, wine list on steroids, most of the food was excellent. Hence the reason for 4 not 5 stars...dessert and one of the main recommendations were just not great. What was great was the Stetson Salad....you must get this. You cannot say you have experienced this restaueant without trying this salad. I shared with hubby, but I could have eaten the whole thing easily. Buffalo carpaccio...another must. Hubby ordered the short ribs and I ordered the small pan fry mushroom. The short ribs were amazing but the mushroom pan fry (which people go nuts for) was not for me. The dessert we ordered was the bread pudding...again just so-so. Bottom line, I would go back there in a heart beat to order other things (but I would get the stetson salad no matter what)."}
{"text":"Innovative southwestern cooking. Small plates can make a meal. The duck confit relleno is to die for. Truly a first class wine list."}
{"text":"Always an outstanding meal, whenever I go to Cowboy Ciao... their chopped salad is one that I've never been able to oversell - it lives up to expectations every, single, time. It's location is great with access to tons of great venues in Old Town Scottsdale.

Great value, excellent service, and exemplary food... highly recommended.. !"}
{"text":"Yay for Restaurant Week!  This place was fantastic!  I ordered the Scallops, Filet Mignon, and Peanut Butter Bar.  All were excellent.  The Filet was cooked to medium rare and it was perfect!  The sauce it came with was amazing and the veggies were delicious.  I wish they had put more on the plate (I only got maybe 5 small wedge potatoes and 5 small asparagus) cause they were so, so good.  I wasn't thrilled with the dessert options, but I asked the waiter which dessert was his favorite, and he chose the peanut butter bar.  He was right!  That was so good.  I had a bite of the bread pudding and that was also very good.  I will have to say that I definitely preferred the peanut butter bar though. :)  The staff was very nice and organized.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Truly wonderful, Beef cheeks with beans, a wonderful server she was awesome, Great wine list and wines by the glass, they get it, true good wines by the glass. Peter stopped by to help with the wines, Robert Foley Griffin and Marshall Family Pinot Noir.  We had a great time fun and laughs. then walked over to Kasmer."}
{"text":"Okay.  It's in an airport with all of the connotations that implies.  But oddly I have learned some really good places to eat are in airports.  The sad part is that if you are not flying somewhere you are not going to be able to eat there.
In any case, this place is nice, clean and, my god quick with the service.  We barely ordered and the food was out to us.
The Open Face Steak Sandwich is tender and flavorful.  I am impressed.  The chips served with it are excellent, the piece of advice I offer up is to be careful of the blue cheese on the chips.  Mild is not a word that goes with this cheese.  In fact my first bite clearly explained to me that I was having a chip with blue cheese on it.  Or more accurately I was having a chip with my blue cheese.  Wow!!!!!
Still thought it was good and if I pass through here again I hope to eat here again."}
{"text":"This place is packed - so why give a flying ... about a single traveller. First question at the door \"do you really want to wait???\" So what's the alternative? F*** off???

Next stage is the server with excessively negative and stressed out attitude. On the shittiest available spot at the bar he takes somebody else's order first who arrived with me and takes off. When I want to place my order he gives me s*** that I'd have wait my turn which \"for sure takes another 10 min hehehe....\". At this point I am ready to walk but give it another 30sec. Cancel the ordered drink and earn a loud and clear \"PERRRRFECT\". 

Picture of 'person' posted. Keep away from maniac and this hole. Actually, I liked them and had dinner with clients in Scottsdale many times (used to recommend their mushroom dish) but that's it!

Unfortunate and bad experience. Go to McDonalds next time"}
{"text":"The chop salad is amazing. We finished with the macaroni and cheese after the short ribs. The blackout cake has licorice and plum jam fennel pollen meringue and licorice syrup. We started with the pulled pork,  the shrimp, and then we were blown away with the mushrooms OMG. What just hit us? Our bartender was this adorable Hawaiian girl and she was bubbly and attentive. Everyone who served us was having fun."}
{"text":"Visiting from out of town and investigating Oldtown.  Almost missed this great place because my wife thought it was closed.  Dark windows make it hard to see inside. It was open and I'm glad I don't listen to her. :-) 

Great place, terrific drinks, incentive menu, and attentive service.  I can't say a bad thing except from the outside it doesn't appear open."}
{"text":"Definitely the only airport bar I've enjoyed in my life. I mean, I've been to fun airports and had fun times, but I've never heard Bernard Purdie, Evelyn Champagne King or Toro Y Moi, or anything at all that resembles music, let alone music that I carry around with me in my pocket. For real, I have 500 songs on my mp3 player ('08) and one of them is Hap'nin by Bernard Purdie (arguably the most sampled drummer of all time, really), so I was natutally excited to hear funky jams while drinking local IPA's despite plane delay. I forgot I was at the airport, and that's all that mattered to me at the time. Good chats with crazy folks from all over 'Merica, and amazingly swift and beyond competent service. These folks are trying, and they're winning. Decor ain't even that bad. All aces, even for a picky vegan from far away. You're lucky to be stranded in Phoenix if you end up here."}
{"text":"Great place to stop when travelling through Phoenix. Great selection of beer and i love the IPA. Had the open top steak sandwich, which I can recommend. If you are stuck at the airport, find this one!!!"}
{"text":"What's the big deal? The chopped salad was a disappointment after reading all the super reviews. We have been here several times over the years. They used to have a mushroom dish that was to die for but no more. Selection of wines is good but so are other places. Had the Good and Boar-ed. It was tasty but wouldn't drive across town for it.
Ambiance is a little tacky (hasn't changed in years) and service was par. Waitress did not seem very friendly but she took care of us ok. Kind of acted like she would rather be doing something else."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service!!  Especially the airport restraint in terminal C.  I would schedule lay overs to experience the fine cuisine! The salads are amazing and fresh!  A wonderful selection and variety of dishes!  YUMMMY"}
{"text":"You haven't lived until you've had the Stetson Chop! It's my favorite salad in the entire world, hands down. The servers are always friendly and they have quite an extensive wine collection; they have a winder (that's a wine binder) because they have so many options."}
{"text":"In Scottsdale on business; the residents highly recommended this place, and I'm so glad my group took the advice. 
Service from the wait staff and bar was attentive and knowledgeable, while being friendly and accommodating. 
The mushroom/polenta dish was wonderful, as was the Stetson salad. The lentil soup and fried trout got raves, too. 
Dessert was fun. We tried blueberry donuts and the Canadian peanut butter torte - delicious. 
Bar had a lovely assortment of whiskey. 
I hope I'm able to visit again!"}
{"text":"Average food.  Typical airport prices. All good used to it as a frequent flyer.  Probably worth a three star review.  But wait.....service, can't be any worse than the typical airport restaurant right?  Folks, it is terrible.  
Arrogant people in this place. I ignored most of it, just wanted to eat and get on my connection.  
I walked back in to get my receipt I forgot, and a jackass barked at me to \"back up....wait in my line!\" (And pointed back outside of the restaurant) I began to explain I, \"....wasn't waiting for a seat I need my....\" he interrupts \"I don't care, you wait in my line!\"   

Mmmm so guess what?  You don't get away with snapping at me. I don't care either.  

Last time I eat here.  Not worth the hassle, wait, arrogance and not too bright clown who has zero listening skills."}
{"text":"Highly recommended. Wine flights are awesome. Pork Belly appetizer and mushroom fry are to die for. My Halibut was the best I ever had. The wife's chicken fried trout was also excellent. Go."}
{"text":"Sorry cowboy , don't know what happened but went there tonight for your Stetson salad and had usual it was great ! Should have stopped there and went home ! 
It took forever to get our meal . The poke bowl was the weirdest thing I've ever eaten 
Your cold duck entree was cold and unappetizing . What a let down after coming here year after year , the only saving grace was your waiter Mark who is the most gracious man ever and so kind and concerned , he's the only reason we may return . We received a complimentary dessert of birthday cake which was just awe full  , we thought it was frozen but that was just the consistency , the chocolate sauce was Hersey syrup , really need to start tasting your own food , so sorry to post this review but it is what it is , hope you can make some real changes . Mark was very understanding and we hope it gets better"}
{"text":"The stetson chopped salad was totally not a salad... unusually delicious.   Tiger prawn with the homing and ploblano us my favorite.  Short ribs was a huge portion and mouth watering. Jerk tuna was a bit too undercooked for my liking, but the side was amazing.  Peach and biscuit bread pudding ... over the top!!  Let's not forget the service top notch."}
{"text":"I've been in the restaurant business for 45 years. The Wife & I had the opportunity to go to Ciao recently. We sat @ the bar where George and Luis were slinging drinks & food. GREAT choice! I had the Puerco Lento, my wife had the Korean-Style BBQ Short Ribs. Both were amazing!! It's really nice having a staff stocked w/true professionals! Service @ the bar was outstanding! Do yourself a favor, go NOW, sit @ the bar & let these guys work their magic...!"}
{"text":"Was out in AZ for spring training and wanted to try a place that wasn't a chain. (So many out there!) So...we tried cowboy ciao. So glad we did!!

Steston chopped salad: the weirdest but most delicious combination of ingredients! Tossed at your table for you!! Soooo yum. 

The mushroom dish...eh. Would pass on that next time. 

And then, the most delicious mouthwatering piece of beef to enter my body. Ok ONE of the most delicious pieces, I've had a lot of yummy steaks in my day! So this thing was a tower of delicious. It had risotto topped with veggies topped with awesome steak topped with stuffed mushroom. Oh my God. Heaven. And it was cooked to perfection. Did I mention I liked it? Yeah, just a little. 

I think I did a wine flight if I remember correctly, which was cool 

Ambiance was...different, but cool. 

We had a pretty good waiter. Wish I could remember his name to give him a high 5 on here!

Thanks for a delicious night Cowboy Ciao!"}
{"text":"Love this place! I try and eat here whenever I fly through. I highly recommend the mushroom dish. Cheers!"}
{"text":"This place is completely unaware it's in an airport. And you forget you are, too. Fantastic service, great food. Stetson chop salad so, so good. Fresh, tasty. Cornbread bread pudding delish."}
{"text":"Very traditional Scottsdale spot, we visited for a 40th birthday dinner and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. Exploring the wine list was a hell of a lot of fun, one of the largest wine lists I've ever seen (although we were a little disappointed when some of the bottles we ordered weren't available). Their stetson chopped salad is pretty famous and is worth ordering, the pastrami-style short rib was also delectable. Worth a visit for sure..."}
{"text":"We came in at 6 tonight, Sunday night, and the hostess said she couldn't give us a table because it was restaurant week, even though there were 14 empty available tables and only 6 tables with people eating.   She said we had to sit at the bar if we didn't have a reservation.  I said we only wanted a salad and would be finished in 30 minutes.  We were led past empty tables for 2, for 4 and for 6 and seated at the completely empty bar.   We shared a salad and were finished within a half hour and during that half hour only 4 people came in.  
On the way out, I asked the manager why we couldn't have been seated at a table, pointing out that we had only been there for 30 minutes and only 4 people had come in during that time leaving 80% of the tables empty and he said, and I quote, \"I didn't want my staff to be overwhelmed so we couldn't offer you a table.\"
The hostess said its restaurant week and they were expecting a lot of people.  The manager said he didn't want his staff to be overwhelmed and meanwhile, the restaurant was basically empty. 
So, great management skills and planning.  It's restaurant week and your staff can't handle serving 2 people a salad in an empty restaurant because they'll be overwhelmed?
Never again."}
{"text":"I find Cowboy Ciao hit or miss.  It is a great concept (mixing Italian with southwestern cooking).  The first time I went, I had the Pig in Palenta and it was amazing!  The whole experience was enjoyable.  I have been there a few times since and the food and staff have been just so so.  The choped salad is consistently legit.  Everything else I've had have been hit or miss."}
{"text":"Great food. Impressive wine list. Only complaint was that we couldn't hear what the waiter was saying because it was so loud."}
{"text":"Been wanting to try here for awhile and finally had a chance during Arizona Restaurant Week. My wife and I were both satisfied with our meals. The Stetson salad is as good as advertised!  Due to the couscous base, we had leftover that we were able to eat the next day. My wife had the short ribs which were very tender. I had the lamb lollipops which were okay but I'd probably get something else if I went back. The restaurant is pretty expensive so thats a definite drawback for a return visit. Service was very good!"}
{"text":"The only reason this is not a 1 star, because their food is amazing and the atmosphere is great is due to service. 

I understand Friday and Saturday nights can be busy but with as many people working as there was, but my service was horrible. If I go out, I expect great service, as should anyone. This was not the case here. 

I may try it again some day down the road but my first experience was not a good one..."}
{"text":"It is a restaurant in a airport.  Let's start there.  You can't have too high of expectations.  We ate here twice.  Once on the way out and once on our way home.  Basically, this was the closest sit down restaurant to our gates.  We had my 82 year old father with us and walking around is not an option.  Staff is friendly, if not trying to do a hard sale. They get where they are and try to get you in and out. Both times my husband ordered the breakfast enchiladas and loved them.  So much so that my dad got them on the second visit.  I got a Stetson Chopped salad the first visit based on the waiter's recommendation which was so so. I then got the quesadilla on return trip.  It was better.  My husband enjoyed their SleepyDog Tail Chaser IPA.  Prices were not terrible for being an airport.  Maybe a dollar more per entrée.  I believe they have a location not in the airport in Phoenix as well.  The way out the waiter was nice enough to let us chill for longer than we should without giving us attitude.  We had about a four hour layover.  Over all an ok place.  I wish food options were healthier.  However, nice to have a sit down option at all vs. typical fast food you usually can get in an airport."}
{"text":"As a fairly frequent guest of Cowboy Ciao in years past, I used to categorize it as \"Cowboy Wow! - Now I'd call it Cowboy \"Bow\" as in Bow-Wow - this place has become a DOG!  

This has become an overpriced memory of what it USED TO BE!  I paid $39.00 for a New York Strip steak that was tough and lacked any flavor.  The total bill for 3 was $165.00 with NO ALCOHOL!  The only remotely saving grace for the meal was the Stetson Chopped Salad which is a Ciao staple and continues to satisfy, but that salad isn't enough to get me to come back any more!

Perhaps Kazimier is too preoccupied with his Wine Bar to pay attention to his historically good restaurant that is fading from old glory faster than you can say \"Isn't that were Cowboy Ciao USED to be?\"

I'm Out!"}
{"text":"I actually ate my food before I could take a picture and post it. I had the open face steak sandwich, the steak was cooked to perfection, it actually melted in my mouth... As I closed my eyes I seen fireworks! Yes, It was that good. 
Amazing gentlemen, great steak sandwich"}
{"text":"The chopped salad with salmon is AMAZING they also offer a vegetarian  and chicken option , they are all great.  Fast and attentive staff,  fabulous bar.  We always recommend this restaurant to visitors of the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"The Stetson Chopped salad is everything you're hoping it'll be and more. Unless the more is a cheeseburger. It's not a cheeseburger."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing.  The wine list is like a college text book.  We had the scallops, tiger prawn, mushrooms, and filet.  The mushrooms were very rich, and a lot for a main dish... It would be best to get the smaller portion and share at the table as a side or appetizer.  The filet and prawns were outta this world!"}
{"text":"There was no actual description in the menu. 

Instead of the expected listing of ingredients, there was a single quote from a customer who loved the dish. From Yelp,  I knew it was a fav and saw the photos of the chopped salad that looked pretty unassuming. But when I asked my server if I should go with this one or the Testosterone Salad, she unequivocally pronounced that the restaurant is known for the Stetson. With this kind of enthusiasm, I went for it, and I wasn't disappointed. 

Smoked salmon, crunchy pepitas, coucous, dried currants, peppery arugula, sweet corn, juicy tomatoes came out with a side of buttermilk dressing. As I was about to stir it up, my server offered to do this for me, which seemed so formal in such an unformal setting, but I appreciated the gesture. The mixture was perfectly balanced and fresh, and I felt full without feeling guilty. Plus, I am a sucker for smoked salmon.

Would definitely return if I'm ever in this airport again, just for this salad. It was a hard choice considering the fact that there are actually quite a few restaurants in this airport that are rated highly on Yelp."}
{"text":"At PHX airport. New location. I assume this is a pale imitation of the real thing. PHX has taken it upon themselves to rip out a lot of the fast food joints and install local restaurants in the terminals. Some are better than others. This one was a pleasant stop for dinner while waiting for a connecting flight. One of these days, I'll have to try out the namesake"}
{"text":"The Stetson salad was super good!  And they have an extensive wine list with some interesting varietals.  Try the wine flight!  A fun way to try new wines from around the world!  Everything was really great here.  I will be back!"}
{"text":"The mac and cheese is amazingly good for airport food. This place is #1 at sky harbor.  The manager has been here 18 years. The bar tender Tai has been her 16 years. Their dedication proves worthy in the food and service. When visiting sky harbor in Phoenix make this a must between other choices!"}
{"text":"Best place in old Scottsdale. Rustic but hip deco. The item they are known for is the Stetson chopped salad and it is a party in the mouth. What flavors and I have yet to find someone who didn't like it when tried. Must see place in Scottsdale"}
{"text":"I would love to give it 5 stars but just can't. The venue , decor , and menu ( plastic covered diner menus) could've been a lot better. It also seems like a franchised steak house. Everything else was great. Food was amazing and drinks were really good. I would definitely come again. The scallops, short ribs, stetson salad, and pork chops were very tasty.The truffle mac and cheese and mushroom pan were very average. Our waiter was knowledgable but a bit passive aggressive and was basically telling us how to eat and not suggesting it."}
{"text":"Great place for lunch if you haven't been you have to go at least once. It's been in oldtown for a very long time and it's a staple of the old town experience. Great food great service. Next time you're around you have to stop by."}
{"text":"Gross. Don't know why there was such a big line for their stinky food. There's about 4 things to choose from. Waiter was annoying and a complete goo"}
{"text":"Do not order the cheese plate. It was pathetic. A tablespoon of capers, 2 tablespoons of Dijon mustard, 3 whole dried apricots, some grapes, and 3 cheeses that were ok, in tiny portion. The salad is still good, the mac and cheese was sad. This place has lost its work ethic. You can see in the open kitchen how the cooks care less. Not a place I would take anyone anymore."}
{"text":"Had the open face steak sandwich with home made potato chips.

Excellent!!!

Prices are typical for airport (higher than normal) but nothing outlandish.

Place is very busy even at 8:30pm, but that's a good sign.

I'll be back."}
{"text":"This was our last stop in the airport on our way home from a week in Scottsdale and I must admit I'm glad we stopped.  It did not look like much from the hallway - noisy airport-bar atmosphere and whatnot, but they managed to seat all six of us despite appearing packed with no wait whatsoever.  Not only that, but the hostess actually asked how long we had until our flight - to ensure either that whatever we ordered would be ready in time, should there be concerns, or recommend things that would be ready in our time frame.  I was quite impressed!

We were seated at a long communal table which worked beautifully, we took over one end and the other side just rotated people as they finished eating.  I initially ordered the pineapple wine with mom to try but they were out of that (supposedly it is quite rare) so I had the sangria instead.  It is very strong in the citrus flavour but the berries at the bottom help balance it and I really enjoyed the drink.

For a meal I tried their daily quesadilla.  Yesterday's was chicken, roasted Anaheim peppers, roasted corn, asiago cheese, and topped with something similar to a chipotle mayo drizzle.  It came with a pepper/mango salsa that was delicious sprinkled on top of the slices.  I got to sample some of the homemade chips which were beautifully seasoned and had come with my mother's West Coast Wrap.

I also got to try a bite of the chicken fried trout.  I highly recommend that dish to anyone who likes seafood - it looks like it would be spicy with the chili and sriracha but the dill aioli and the buttermilk coating on the fish blend out the spice so you get the flavour of the spicy ingredients but not the heat.  And the coleslaw...Derek is not a coleslaw fan so he had a few bite then let mom and I fight it out for the rest...It was one of the best coleslaws I have ever had.  It was a simple cabbage slaw tossed in lime juice and vinegar in such a way that it disappeared as soon as we were allowed to eat it.

We did not stick around for dessert, because our flight was supposed to board 20 minutes after we finished eating...but between the pleasant service and the delicious food I would definitely eat there again!"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere and creative menu, but poor execution earned Cowboy Ciao 3 stars today. 

My husband and ate breakfast here before flying internationally. We were in a good mood and looking for a yummy meal to kick off the trip. I asked how the Mexcal Mule was and our server told me it was horrible! I appreciate the honesty, but the margarita I ordered instead was a major disappointment. My husband's bloody Mary was watery and tasted like a bad mixer. His meal of Chorizo Enchiladas was a little bland, but not bad. I really enjoyed the flavors and textures of the Pig 'n Puddin' (or some spelling variation), but the polenta was more of a cream-of-wheat consistency than the toothier texture I expected. 

We finished our food but left our drinks 2/3 full."}
{"text":"I've lived here all my life and never even heard of this place. We went here for a work outing and they have very unique food. Their stetson chopped salad is something I've never had anywhere, and it is very good. I won't spoil it for people but if you go, order it and taste it for yourself. It is supposed to be western fusion, but I really don't sense that. Especially when I ordered the Korean ribs! 


Visited January 2012"}
{"text":"At PHX on a 3 hour lay over. This place is just what the doctor ordered. Breakfast enchiladas were surprisingly decent for airport food. Plus, when ordering a beer you could a shot for an additional  $4."}
{"text":"The service was not very good, and we sat at the bar. For the middle of the week, at the end of the lunch service. The service was disappointing since a friend had said they were known for their service and drinks. It took 20 min to get a draft beer another 20 min to finally see the guy to put in our lunch order. The food was good and the service got a little better, but it took the owners daughter to get better service."}
{"text":"Made a reservation for lunch on a Friday but one wasn't really needed. There was plenty of seating available with or without one. Heard so much about the Stetson salad that we had to order it. We got one with smoked salmon and one with chicken. I was initially skeptical about the smoked salmon option but it was the better of the two. The tiger prawns were really more large shrimp in size and the mushrooms were bland. I loved the pickle that came with the Reuben sandwich because it was a little sweet, sour, and spicy all at the same time. Come for the smoked salmon Stetson salad and skip the mushrooms."}
{"text":"Chopped salad is pretty delicious!! Don't waste $12 on it here. Go to Wildflower Bread Company and get the same salad less money more food, and in my opinion, it tastes better than Ciao :)

The rest of the food here is good though!

LOVE the Nikolashka shot- def worth trying if you haven't"}
{"text":"we went back - held our groupon coupon until it was time to pay. I'm not saying that is what got us better service because I don't believe that to be the truth. BUT this visit was very different from our last! It was great from the beginning to the end. We had an awesome waiter who was perfectly attentive. He did a great job & gave us great service! The food was well cooked, a bit salty, but delicious! I have changed my mind about Cowboy Ciao & would be willing to go back again. Still rave about the Mushroom Pan Fry!! Good save this time! Thx for the improved service, much appreciated - upgraded one star  :)"}
{"text":"It's been my intention to have dinner here again (we visited many years ago) but alas, it still hasn't happened.  We did a culinary food tour in Scottsdale and this was one of the stops.  We were served their famous chopped salad and it was tasty.  Delicious drinks too!"}
{"text":"I just had one of the worst customer service experiences of my foodie dining career. The server, Janet.... Or maybe Janice, a seemingly nice middle aged gal was sub par and did nothing to fix an easily fixable situation. In fact the head manager a tall thin man also seemed to not care about how customers were treated at all. The server was MIA most of the time, failed to fill my water twice and I had to remind her... Twice. And when she did fill the water glass it was only to 75% full. When I mentioned that she wasn't fully filling the glass, she filled my water glass to the exact same amount a walked away. Once I finished my meal I walked over to the to-go stand to look at dessert, since my server failed to ask if I wanted any. I ordered the pudding which was tossed into a blue \"McDonald's style\" water cup. I asked to have this item removed from the bill as this presentation was not logical to bring on a flight and not worth 7$. The manager came over aloof and disinterested in satisfying me as the customer. And just as I walked away from the to-go stand I see the server I had and then hear her chime loudly... \"Oh is that my shitty friend?!\". I was appalled. How does a manager hear this and do NOTHING. The food was wonderful as always and but the service (as a past server myself) was horrible. I did leave a $3 tip which was only $1 below 20% and now I'm wishing I left her nothing. The comment was more than inappropriate and I feel as though this is the only way to voice my concerns, as the manager behaved as though he could care less. I hope that things change in a positive way, because the food is so amazing and deserves great service to accompany it."}
{"text":"A lot of people rave about the Stetson Salad here, it is unique and very good. I had a business dinner here this week, and was very happy. I had the Pastrami smoked short ribs, absolutely outstanding! I travel for business every week and have had fine meals at some of the best restaurants around the country. This short rib dish I must say is the best piece of beef I have ever put in my mouth. The spice rub and sauce blend perfectly to make one of the best dishes I have ever had. 

The ambience is very cool, as you would expect in a Scottsdale spot. I travel to Phoenix regularly and Cowboy Ciao will definitely be on the top of the list of go-to spots."}
{"text":"Here's the good and the bad.  The host at this restaurant was either in a bad mood or hates his job.  No smile no welcome feeling.  Ordered the $20 hamburger.   Husband can't eat the potato chips that comes with it so asked if he could sub a side salad.l with blue cheese dressing.  No problem said our server.  Burger was yummy. Side salad was nothing more than spring lettuce.  Got the bill and we're charged an extra 3.00 for the lettuce and 1.00 for the watery blue cheese dressing.  Really?  Server tried to explain how much extra lettuce costs than potatoes.   Won't be back."}
{"text":"This place was so awesome...and we were at the airport. Literally one of of best dinner experiences of our vacation. Made our 3 hour layover a blessing. Doug was fantastic with his drink and food recommendations. Can't say enough great things about this experience!! Terminal B a must as the Phoenix airport!!"}
{"text":"The mushroom dish that someone was quoted as saying is, \"...so good I want to roll around in it...\" was AMAZING.  The ribs were AMAZING.  The service was AMAZING.  I love this place.  'nough said."}
{"text":"So, judging from the rest of the reviews, I guess I caught them on a bad day.  A day bad enough for food poisoning.  I don't think I would return, even if it was free.  meh."}
{"text":"One senses a unique bend of lighthearted swank and artsy irreverence when entering Cowboy Ciao. The mixture of these two elements is a dicey proposition that's fraught with peril, but management has successfully done it...and  created an ambiance that mixes soft and hip music, subdued and sultry lighting, and break-the-rules decor while still coming off as elegant funk rather than young punk angst.

Myself and my sidekick got here during prime time on a Friday night when the estimated table-wait was hovering right around the 40 minute mark.  Rather than hole-up for a table, we opted for zero-wait seating at the bar.  The waiters were great....both informative and talkative folks that made you feel comfortable with a genuinely friendly air about them that eschewed excessive fawning in favor of a down-home demeanor laced with neighborly charm.

Grub-wise, everything we had was fantastic.  We started out with a Ciabatta appetizer served with both green and kalamata olive puree.  Next up, the famous \"Chopped Stetson Salad\", an indescribably unique and wonderful taste that's often known to upstage the main course.  They bring it to you with six different ingredients set in rows and explain what each ingredient is. Next, their server mixes it up in front of you with a special dressing.  It's savory taste and simple recipe has presented experienced cooks with something of an inexplicable magic trick.  From what I gather, many have tried to duplicate the taste, texture, and nuances of this deceptively simple dish, and lack of success has created vexing puzzle that's become the local culinary equivalent of Fermat's Enigma or the Four Color Problem. 

My date opted for Pistachio-crusted salmon.  I went light and ordered the Exotic Mushroom Pan Fry.  Both dishes were fantastic.  Icing on the cake came in the form of my favorite beer on the planet....Anchor Steam on tap.  My only gripe?  My dish should have come with bread to soak up the excess Mushroom sauce.  We asked if we could get some, and the only option provided was to order another ciabatta appetizer.  C'mon people...bread is cheap!  My date and her raging sweet tooth opted for desert....I had another beer.  She satiated her sugary cravings with something called a \"zinger\" that looked like raspberry infused cheesecake, and sang it's praises while relishing every morsel of it.

Welcoming ambiance and staff.  Great menu and fantastic, creative dishes.  There's no TV visible anywhere, but the staff will update you on the D-backs or Suns games if you ask. Downtown Scottsdale is chock-full of incredible shops, and the surrounding area makes for a nice post-meal stroll. All in all, it's a truly unique dining experience that's taken the artistic ethos of it's surrounding area and successfully applied it to Southwestern Cuisine.  If you're in the area and looking to chow down in a manner that'll give you something to tell the folks back home about,  then by all means stop by, sit down, and check it out."}
{"text":"Cowboy Ciao has always been the place we go for special occasions.  When I got a promotion, we went to Cowboy Ciao.  When my parents and my (now husband's) parents met for the first time, we took them to Cowboy Ciao.  When my husband forgot my birthday, he (tried) to make it up to me by bringing me to Cowboy Ciao - it worked.  It has held a special place in my heart from the first time I walked into and was pleasantly surprised to see it wasn't spelled Cowboy CHOW.  I have NEVER been disappointed.

Until last weekend.

It's been a while since we've been to Cowboy Ciao so you can imagine my excitement when my girlfriend wanted to celebrate her birthday at my favorite spot.  We had reservations for 11 people (yes, a large group) at 8pm on Saturday, October 23rd.  The night started off fine but quickly degenerated. 

I started with the chopped salad, always a winner.  And, though I ALWAYs order the blue cheese stuffed pork chop (the ONLY place I'll eat pork), I'm pregnant and can't eat blue cheese.  Instead of being bummed, I thought it an opportunity to try something new - which I was sure would be fabulous.  

I went for the home style Mac and Cheese.  It was horrendous.  As if they had baked it at noon and let it sit out until 10pm when our dinner was finally served. Looking back, I should have sent it back to the kitchen (something I never do)... it was THAT bad. 

My friend had the chicken fried trout.  Bland.
My husband had the mushroom plate and loved it.
Another friend had the tuna and thought it was good.
And the (sausage?) risotto was also pleasing to another gal.
That's all I really know from my end of the table.

As far as wine... We tried to order 6 different bottles - none of which they had.  The water refilling never happened.  The services overall was terribly slow even as the restaurant was beginning to empty.

And though it is a small thing, they charge for the bread which just seemed tacky.

In the end, I was initially pleased to see our server had divided up the bill... and then terribly frustrated to find he had only separated four people, left the rest in a mess of confusion, and completely botched the checks he DID separate.  It took no less that 30 minutes to sort through it all and at 11pm we finally left.

In the end it was an expensive, unsatisfying, unnecessarily long evening and I'm sad to say that we will not go back.  With so many wonderful places to eat in the valley, Cowboy Ciao has some work to do to get back on top."}
{"text":"The food is excellent!!! Service is just OK, actually kinda bad, the servers act annoyed with simple requests and rarely visit table. Also, the dinner portion of The signature salad (that is incredible) is DOUBLE the price of the appetizer version and really doesn't seem like much more... kind of a rip off, other items also seem overpriced compared to other restaurants in the area. The salad is also at The Gladly and Citizen Public House..  they have great service at both of those restaurants. Will not be going back here any time soon."}
{"text":"I have been going to this establishment for a few years now, and it is by far my favorite restaurant in the valley. 

I have never had something that I did not absolutely love there. The fillet is astounding, and seems to get better every time i have it. I don't even like cooked mushrooms, and yet they somehow managed to make me a fan of the mushroom pan fry, delicious. I like to call in take out orders for their burgers on the regular because they are so delicious. 

All in all, if you haven't visited this place yet, put it at the top of your to do list. For such great service, AMAZING food, and outstanding ambiance, with reasonable pricing you really cant go wrong."}
{"text":"The food was Ok.....  I don't like crunchies  on my Mac and cheese.  I don't like grease cheese on my grilled cheese.  My dad liked his and they have a full bar."}
{"text":"If you are in Scottsdale, you must attend. The food is creative and outstanding. The mushroom dish is just about the best thing I've ever had and worth all the positive praise and comments you'll see from other patrons. Do not miss this place.
Great service as well."}
{"text":"interesting menu choices and just good food, but didn't impress me too much for the price."}
{"text":"The steak and lamb were excellent and reasonably priced at less than $40.00.  The dirty martinis were good but had to take a star off for a 1.00 charge for stuffed olives ( any steakhouse worth going to has blue cheese stuffed olives for FREE) and a 1.00 charge for more vodka in a martini.  Change the price of the martini to $9 instead of $7.  1.00 charges on a bill remind me of a fast food joint.  Excellent place with fantastic food.  Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I always give extra points for good service, even if the food isn't outstanding. I waited at the hostess stand for over 10 minutes! Wait staff kept walking by without even acknowledging my presence. It was so weird that even another patron asked if I was in line because I was getting no service.

Finally, I was seated in the back. It was so noisy that people had to scream to be heard. I was traveling alone so I just put on my noise canceling headphones. A weird way to eat, but it worked.

My waiter was actually really nice. He made great recommendations, was engaging, and made sure that my hot water pot was always full for my cup of tea.

The food itself was ok. Despite the large crowd, it was ready in a normal amount of time. The thing I like about this place is the variety. When you travel alot, the options seem to be burgers or salads. Expect something a little different here. 

If they turned the TVs down a little bit, I would come on every trip"}
{"text":"Went there about a year ago.  You gotta get the Stetson Chopped Salad (great mixture of flavors--very Southwestern) and also the exotic mushroom pan fry. Enormous wine list too...had to ask for some recommendations on that!"}
{"text":"Good food. Must put it on your list for at least one visit. Staff a bit overly arrogant, especially when there a several restaurants that offer the same type of fare with equal quality nearby. My filet was great, the quesadilla del dia was good and the dessert was very good."}
{"text":"Good Date Night Spot!!!  Went here the other night for dinner and it was really good. I had the steak and my wife had the casa dilla of the day.  Both were cooked to perfection.  Sometimes nicer places have really small portions and seem to pay more attention to how pretty the dish is instead of how good it is but this place was spot on with both presentation and taste. We did not have a reservation so we sat at the bar which has full menu service.  The bar wraps around and near the men's restroom there is some additional bar seats that nobody sits at.  I thought this area might have been a little more private than some of the two person tables.  I also thought it was cool to be able to see into the kitchen but that might only be appealing to me.  The bartender was very knowledgeable and checked on us several times during our meal.  This place has a good vibe for couples doing the date night thing but there was also a table of 6 near us who were also having a good time.  Cowboy Ciao is a win win.  The desert donuts are ridiculously good as well."}
{"text":"I can probably just give 5 stars just for the Stetson Chopped Salad. And the Wild Boar Meatballs with the delicious cream sauce. And the fabulously fatty Berkshire Pork Belly.

We also ordered the Cheeky Porky, but I found the pork cheek meat to be a little bit on the dry side. But, the accompanying pancakes were good, along with the sauce that topped it.

Our waiter was attentive. We had a table along the windows which provided a great view for people watching.

Great place to dine, if you're ever in the downtown Scottsdale area."}
{"text":"After 5 years of living/working a stone's throw from Cowboy, I finally pulled the trigger and ate lunch here with co-workers. First impression was subpar. I called to make a reservation for 7 people at 12pm on a Wednesday. I was a bit surprised that the host required a credit card to hold our table. Really? For lunch?

When we arrived, we were seated promptly but it took 20 minutes to have waters brought to the table. It took another 30 minutes for our food to be served. I had the vegetarian chopped salad which was delicious. It wasn't good enough to outweigh the bad service paired with high prices. Unfortunately, this place is a little pretentious for my liking. Too bad!"}
{"text":"Great staff and never disappointing.  I have a hard time going here and not getting the Stetson Salad.  Interesting food combinations that definitely please the taste buds."}
{"text":"Best chopped salad on the planet. No lie. Flat iron steak was perfect. Amazing overall."}
{"text":"Had a 3hr layover at Phoenix Airport and was super happy with this choice! The server was very attentive and quick to offer suggestions! Lots of choices sadly they ran out of steak for the steak salad but I choose the Roasted green Chile pasta and very happy with the suggestion and it was very good! Lots of flavor but needed a little salt - overall very happy!"}
{"text":"They would've been given 5 stars if it hasn't been for the horrible service given by my waitress. One of the managers helped me most of the time because he noticed she was ignoring me. Stetson chopped salad is by far one of the best salads I've ever had in my life! The mini mushroom dish was amazing, as well!! Two people could split both and be good to go-just FYI. Bartender made me a non-alcoholic mojito, which was great!! I would definitely come back, just hopefully served by a different person next time!"}
{"text":"We got here at about 5:30pm on a Saturday night. We did not have reservations and were told there would be a wait, although nearly every table was empty. We were offered immediate seating if we wanted to sit at the bar. This wasn't ideal for us, but we chose this option so we could eat quicker. The bar tender/server was very friendly. I believe his name was Sal. I had looked at Yelp reviews prior to the visit. My boyfriend ordered the Mini Mushroom Pan Fry and I ordered the Stetson Salad. The mushroom dish was great, but we did not get any morels in ours despite being listed as one of the mushrooms included in the dish (we hunt for morels every year in Minnesota so we're pretty familiar with this mushroom). I'm not sure about AZ, but in MN morels are only in season for a very short while. I never order salads at a restaurant, but the Stetson Salad looked good from pictures. It was probably one of the best salads I have ever had. I had originally wanted to order the port balsamic dressing, but the server talked me into the classic pesto buttermilk and I'm so glad he did. It was amazing!! My boyfriend could not stop eating the dressing! I struck up a conversation with a woman sitting in a seat near us at the bar. She had the Stetson salad and the filet Mignon.  She said she was a regular and those two were her favorite dishes. Her steak dish looked amazing. Overall I would definitely be back for the salad next time I'm in AZ."}

you should probably order the stetson salad. crazy delicious and the texture is to die for!"}
{"text":"I don't think you can go wrong with this place. I've tried multiple items on their menu and I have never been disappointed. My favorite, by far, is the cure for the common salmon. I get that 90% of the time I go there. The flavor, the dressing, the detail to each little thing is splendid.

One thing to note, the lunch prices are much cheaper than dinner prices, but the quality is just as good. I go there at least once a week for lunch and on occasions for dinner with friends.

Another thing I love, is that they have the huge Mexican Coca-Cola bottles, which makes the experience so much better!

Whether you live in the area or you're visiting Scottsdale, make sure you stop by and try something here, you won't be disappointed, I promise."}
{"text":"The food here is witty and fun and delicious, Chef Bernie should really get more recognition around the valley, the Stetson Chopped is such a great medly of flavors and texture and Pastry Chef Tracy Dempsey is a goddess.  She is the one who created the blueberry french toast bread pudding with maple ice cream and bacon brittle.  Even when I'm super stuffed with my meal, I always order the bread pudding, it's really an amazing and clever dessert.  Thanks Bernie and Tracy!"}
{"text":"Not cheap but great food. You get what you pay for and the filet mignon was perfect. Good selection of wines and friendly staff. TJ served us and was great, attentive and friendly and also knowledgable about the wines offered. 

It's airport good but it is good airport food and worth the money."}
{"text":"This place is off-da-hook! Yo. The menu is extremely creative and the food is incredible.  Large portions so forget the diet or plan an extra 45 minutes on the treadmill in the morning.

The famed Stetson Chopped Salad (I prefer with salmon) is to die for and the ribs are just a hot mess (the good kind). This is the place where Foodies and People Watchers encountered supernatural powers.  :-) Friday evenings are great for dining and then a stroll through Old Scottsdale. I strongly recommend an early reservation, particularly if you want to smooze a few clients.  No one will be disappointed."}
{"text":"I met up with two of my gal pals for dinner at Cowboy Ciao a few weeks ago while I was in town visiting family.  I had been eyeballing the short ribs dish ever since I checked out the menu online and hoped that the dish would live up the hype that I built up. The dish lived up to the hype.  The meat fell off of the bones and was perfectly tender. There was some type of cherry BBQ sauce that came with the dish, and it was pretty strong so I used it sparingly. Honestly, the meat was seasoned perfectly, and it didn't need the sauce. The short ribs were resting on grilled veggies and Gouda cheese grits. I thought that I didn't like grits, but apparently when they are done right and with a shit load of Gouda, I love them! :) I knew I would be pushing my stomach limits this night, so I only had a couple of veggies. I needed the room for the short ribs and the grits.  

Our waitress was attentive without being over bearing and helped us pick out a wine and beer for the group.    Good times were had at Cowboy Ciao!"}
{"text":"Great service - shared a communal table with some interesting people and watched a bit a football whilst waiting for a flight. Food would be 4 stars and service 5+."}
{"text":"So excellent as to be memorable years later. It is all about the Stetson Chopped Salad. I don't even like salmon usually. But this is a pretty medley of fresh ingredients, laid out in stripes on your plate. Should I have the pleasure to return to Scottsdale, I will be dining here for sure."}
{"text":"We do not go often. But everytime we have been I loved the food, the service and the feel of the place. As the old saying goes, try it you'll like it. ;-{)"}
{"text":"Is it just me, or is airport food getting better?  I stopped at Cowboy Ciao in a hurry before my flight.  Vegan food isn't always easy to find in an airport, but Ciao hit the spot.  I had a spinach wrap loaded with arugula, tomatoes, avocado, salsa and corn.  The wrap was super fresh and tasty but it was the potato chips that took the meal to the next level.  The homemade chips were a little thicker than average, and were very brown.  I used to toss out the brown ones in favor of the pasty white chips.  Not anymore.  These thick, perfectly browned and salted chips were among the best I've ever had.  If you're catching a flight at Sky Harbor, check out Cowboy Ciao, and get those chips!  Oh, and the counter lady was super nice!  Nice matters!"}
{"text":"Two words. Stetson Chop! Believe the hype, you HAVE to try this thing. Such random ingredients but the combination is so good it's almost sinful. I kind of cheat though and head on to Kazimierz and get the SC there just because I am in love with the atmosphere :)"}
{"text":"This not your ordinary airport dining experience! TJ the waiter is awesome- he is totally committed to providing you with a a fabulous description of the entrees- go for the stetson chopped salad! Thanks tj!"}
{"text":"Oh so slammed. I get it. But the waiters seemed a little deer in headlights. I enjoyed the mushroom polenta dish and yay for having Mother Road on tap."}
{"text":"On a 3-hour layover in Phoenix, I restrained myself from physically harming the multitudes of luggage-wielding cattle that walked right in front of me, stopped right in front of me, managed to trip themselves on my luggage, and be overall rude.

On a 3-hour layover in Phoenix, I searched for a place to regain sanity, relax, and eeeaaattttt. Well, that and grab a bloody mary.

Enter Cowboy Ciao. As soon as I stepped up, I was greeted and asked if I needed an outlet. 

Um, YES PLEASE.

I got to sit at a table with a plug, munching away at my perfectly-crispy breakfast quesadilla (yum!) and zesty bloody mary, away from the circus just outside of the restaurant. 

I left relaxed & full, and so did my iPhone. 

On a 3-hour layover in Phoenix, my faith in Sky Harbor was renewed by Cowboy Ciao."}
{"text":"Good place for a meal. Much better than airport fast food. The breakfast enchiladas have tasty shredded beef. The salsa and pico de gallo provide the right amount of spice. Two eggs any style provide extra protein. Avocado provides a splash of green. It also has liquid courage for your flight."}
{"text":"WHY did I not order a Stetson Chopped Salad for myself instead of opting to share it with my girl?! BAD BAD choice, on my part. Once again, after 2+ years of not having one, it blew my boots off.

We made reservations and they seated us as we walked in the door at our appointed time.

Our server, Gabe, was extraordinary- attentive and on the ball.

We split the Stetson Chopped, had an order of \"Crispy Mac N Cheese\" and the BBQ ribs with the cherry BBQ sauce. The mac n cheeze was okay, a little dry, though they did provide a nice salsa thingy to moisten it up. The ribs n cherry sauce, OMG!!!

Wish they would sell the Stetson Chopped and ship it to me in San Diego... I am sure they would for a price, eh? I'll let you know how that day goes."}
{"text":"Have been to Cowboy Ciao a handful of times - the last time being a few years ago.  I continue to believe that this is a solid Scottsdale option.  Cowboy Ciao offers a selection of dressed-up comfort food items - fish and beef.  The restaurant ambiance is nice and casual. 

Cowboy Ciao is known for the chopped salad.  It is a delicious salad and don't miss it.

I ordered the jerk ahi tuna.  It is seared and served rare.  It was very tasty.  My wife ordered the mushroom pan fry.  Fortunately, our waiter suggested that she order the appetizer version since the dish is extremely rich.  It was a perfect size for her and something to consider.

Cowboy Ciao also has a very extensive wine list for those who enjoy a nice glass of wine with their meal.  

Great service, tasty food and a nice setting."}
{"text":"I'm not much of a foodie, however, I love to eat, so when this place was recommended for a yummy and unique dinner, it was a no brainer that this was where we'd go. 

The mushroom polenta dish was so good that I googled the recipe in attempt to replicate it once I got home. Needless to say, I failed. But like they say, often imitated, never duplicated.

My only dislike was the minimal menu, and since I'm a vegetarian, there was only so much I was able to eat. If you're not a picky eater, you'll enjoy anything you order here."}
{"text":"STETSON SALAD!!! If you hate salad get the Stetson Salad, if you love salad, get the Stetson Salad. Everything was delicious here and the service was very nice. The wine list may take you a month to peruse, but there is something on it for everyone! Great spot!"}
{"text":"We came for the famous chopped salad.  My Canadian friend had never been, so it was quite a treat.  The salad was delicious as usual & the service was fabulous.  Our server recommended the bread pudding for dessert, so we decided to share it, big mistake!  It wasn't just the best bread pudding I've ever had, it was one of the best desserts I've ever had!  What a great experience!"}
{"text":"I've come to realize my reviews are getting too long and since I don't bother reading long reviews, I'll try and keep it shorter, but with enough details.

This place used to be all the rage back in the day and I always kind of thought it was overrated. Having gone again recently for a co-worker's birthday, I'd say it was a little better than I remember, but nothing crazy.

Server said the best thing on their lunch menu was the Reuben Wishes He Was This Cool. He said it was hands down the best. It wasn't though unfortunately. He even convinced the people in the group who don't even like Reubens to try it and all 4 of us were disappointed. The bread seemed stale and the meat was nothing crazy, just average at best.

A couple co-workers got the Corn Nuts About Scallops which was pretty awesome. I wish I had gotten that.

Bread Pudding was good. Definitely get it for dessert.

The Truffled Mac N Cheese was also great, but I'm a sucker for truffle anything.

Came here for brunch a while back and was unimpressed.

The place isn't terrible by any means, but it also isn't anything great. 3 stars seems fitting to me."}
{"text":"Fantastic chopped salad along with a very tasty Short Rib dish.  A Scottsdale institution, great food selection and menu along with atmosphere and good service placed this in the AZ rotation."}
{"text":"Do you LOVE overpriced mushrooms and risotto? Do you love 19-year old hosts who you wised were like 7 years older? If you like to share food, then this is the place for you.

I was in AZ for a bachelorette party, and two of girls in our party suggested CC for our Friday night dinner. A few of us ordered items to share: beet risotto, short rib risotto, crispy mac 'n cheese, mushroom pan fry...

Pass on the gazpacho, and the crispy mac 'n cheese was waaaaaay spicy. 

Anyway....the setting worked for our group of 7. The menu is definitely interesting."}
{"text":"The Stetson is amaze-ballz. Hands down my all time favorite salad. 

Super quick and healthy meal to call in for take-out (they make so many of them they can have an order ready in 10 minutes).

Only complaint: I wish the portions were larger!"}
{"text":"Best food in Arizona this trip! 
The chips are fantastic, the burger the greatest, the mushroom polenta dish has our inner foodies going, the drinks lovely, the service by TJ beyond the call...

Definitely, this is just a taste of the larger restaurant in Phoenix.

Next trip- already making plans."}
{"text":"Had the Testosterone Salad. The steak was tender, cooked to perfection and well seasoned. A bit too much dressing mixed in. I would suggusted to get dressing on side. 

Also had a Sangria, with fresh berries in it. It was pretty good. It seems to have OJ in it, which is a interesting twist. A hint of OJ would be better, as it seems bartender may have added too much OJ by accident. The person next to me had the same thing but mine was more orange in color than theirs.

Overall a decent restaurant and best airport restaurant ever had."}
{"text":"The food is decent, nothing to really go crazy about and not really worth the price. but it's decent and close to work so that makes it easy.

the biggest issue i have is with the service. after multiple visits i have come to the conclusion that the servers and employees are friendly but it takes 1.5 hrs to have lunch. and that wouldn't be a problem if i thought the food was spectacular enough to wait that long. and our drinks are almost always empty and the servers are hard to find. 

i'll most likely continue eating here every now and then bc it's convenient and it's easy to please everyone... but i wouldn't really go out of my way to go here."}
{"text":"Everything you've heard about the Stetson chopped salad is true.  When my family and I booked this place for Arizona Restaurant Week, we did so with the promise from friends that we would have a salad we'd never forget.  They were right.  In addition, the mac n cheese appetizer was also delicious.  I had the Pig-n-Puddin for the main course which was full of flavor.  It was a little soupy for my taste, but otherwise I really couldn't complain.  For desert we split a banana creme pie and the bread pudding.  Both dishes didn't disappoint.  Our waiter treated us extremely well and even gave my Mom the recipe for the chopped salad (I hope he didn't break any rules in doing so).  The atmosphere was eclectic but laid back.  I can certainly understand why this place has a loyal clientele.  Overall, I give them a four out of five for their restaurant week presentation.  The main dish options could've been a little better, but I plan to go back at some point to try some of their other famous main course offerings"}
{"text":"Walking in the service was prompt and courteous. Keep in mind I am traveling on a holiday which in my experience has been very light for airports in traffic. However I was seated and greeted very quickly. Our server was fantastic. Highly attentive and very personable. 

After perusing the menu for a while, it was very hard to choose as things seemed out of my normal dining choices, not bad, just different. So my motto is when in doubt grab a damn burger. So I got the pulled pork burger and my daughter, as usual, had a grilled cheese. (If you ever wonder where the good grilled cheese sandwiches are located, just ask me.)

My burger showed up and looked simply delicious. I could not wait to taste it!! I cut it in half and took my first bite....and I was slightly disappointed. It was lacking in all the flavor the menu description promised. The chips that came with it were okay but also tasted like nothing. I ate half of the burger then started to read my book. About 10 minutes later I picked at a few of the pieces of pork and avocado that had fallen off the burger and scooped them up with the chips. So good! It was like the meat needed to sit for a minute to get some flavor lol. 

Bow the burger as a whole was not horrible. The meat was very good and tender and cooked perfectly for me. (I ordered it medium.) Even after we spilt a glass of water all over the booth the server was still very nice and just ran over to help as much as he could."}
{"text":"Love this place. Right in old town gallery area. Great food and wait staff. Ask questions and get some interesting feedback"}
{"text":"We came to Cowboy Ciao during restaurant week and were expecting to have a great time. While the food was all pretty good, the service and the atmosphere was kind of a bust. The restaurant was FREEZING. Like 63 degrees....and we got sat directly under one of the vents. And the restroom was even colder. The food itself was pretty good- scallops with risotto app, pork with (not so great) acorn squash mash, and the filet, finished with the bread pudding (awesome). It took a good 15-20 minutes between each course and the waitress kept apologizing for the wait but we were starving! The filet was recommended medium, and my friend ordered it medium well. When it was brought to the table, it was definitely rare. She showed the waitress who agreed it was not medium well and took the steak back to get the temp brought up. That took another 10 minutes and by the time it was brought out, the rest of us had eaten about half of our meal and the other half of it became so cold because the vent was blowing cold air directly on it. I guess it's our fault for not speaking up to have our food taken back to have it heated up again (which is kind of gross in the first place) but the entire staff looked like they were ready to get the hell out of there closing up shop and then sitting at the bar for a drink when they were done. We would have gotten out of their hair sooner had the time between courses been a little quicker. We had all finished eating and for about 15 minutes our dirty dishes sat in front of us while the staff continued to clean and close. Once we ordered dessert, it took exactly (yes we even joked a little and timed it because of the 2 previous courses) 21 minutes to get.....21 minutes!? When she dropped it off she apologized again and told us \"I'm so sorry the kitchen staff all left so there was nobody to make it, I guess they didn't realize we still had a table.\"

 Sooooo that was the finale to what could have been a great meal. Luckily this was restaurant week so it was a deal with 3 courses @ $40 a person (normal entrees there are 30-40 individually) The majority of our bill was on wine that we kept ordering between courses because it was taking so long. Every restaurant week we choose 1 place to go to and we were really looking forward to this...unfortunately, it left a pretty bitter taste in all our mouths and I don't  think we will be going back :/"}
{"text":"We ordered a different type of grits than what came with our meal.

The completely unattentive waitress who I m almost possitive was on drugs, brought out the wrong ones.

So after 15 mins we finally flagged her down and she reordered them.

After seeing them sit on the counter for a while, we got another server to bring them to us..............

It was the same ones we sent back!!!

This happened three times before she got it right.

I dont think Ive ever experienced De Ja Vu like that ever!!

How many times can you reorder the same thing ?

The food wasnt bad but not great.

We got the ribs and the bbq sauce was too vinegary for me ( is that a word?)"}
{"text":"Everything is wonderful. Nice wine selection. I highly recommend going here to anyone wanting a nice meal while in Scottsdale. Romantic atmosphere."}
{"text":"This place was an unexpected find in the Phoenix Airport. 

I had more than 2 hours of layover here, so after spending money on stuff I did not need in the shops, I settled into here to wait out the rest of my time. 

The menu had an assortment to suit most tastes, from salads, to grazing (appetizers), to some signature smaller bites and entrees covering all the tastes from carnivore to pescatarian to vegetarian. I loved the wide variety on the grazing menu with items like pork barbacoa, bison tartare, buffalo carpaccio, crispy porkbelly, quesadilla, and a cheese plate. 

I settled in with the Truffled Mac & Cheese topped with potato chips and crisp panchetta paired with a nice Brut Rosé (which they offered by the glass or bottle). 

All I can say, is that this is not your father's airport food. I felt like I was in a trendy local spot. The food was delicious, the wine list impressive, and the service was some of the most attentive I have ever had (never mind that I was in an airport). 

While I rarely get to pass through Phoenix, I would definitely seek out Cowboy Ciao, in Terminal 4, the next time a layover permitted."}
{"text":"We have been here many times in the last 10+ years. The Stetson Salad is the best salad I have ever had. The combination of sweet, crunchy, savory and acidic is perfect to me. Lately, I have also tried the Scallops on Beet risotto. The scallops are great, but the risotto just doesn't work, though I love beets and I love risotto.  I have, of course, had the mushroom stir fry, which is very good but very hearty and heavy. Soups have been excellent. The current best desert is that peanut butter brownie. But beware...it is really rich and sweet. I also enjoy the wine flights here. Most recently, I took my 8 and 11 year olds at lunch. Though they were the only kids there, they thoroughly enjoyed the Kobe beef burgers. This is still my favorite place in Old Town."}
{"text":"As a Yelp \"Elite\" reviewer, we're encouraged to write detailed reviews and as much as I enjoy writing, there are times when a simple one-word review would suffice:

Delicious.  Period. Exclamation point.

Cowboy Ciao (what a great name) is terrific.  Sky Harbor, the Phoenix Airport, has morphed into one of the finest airports in the Country and really caters to the Foodies of the world.  Each gate has its own micro epicurean stranglehold to keep you nourished and delighted without having to wander to a different gate to indulge in typical fast food fare.

Cowboy Ciao is definitely part of a heavyweight triumvirate of restaurants in this corridor of Sky Harbor.  Although we were there during the peak breakfast hours, we were allowed to order anything off the menu, always great if you're not in the mood for breakfast or your internal clock is screaming for dinner.  

I ordered the breakfast enchiladas.  This was a meal worth the money ($14.99) in value and taste.  Perfect over-easy eggs blanketed enchiladas with chorizo and potatoes on a bed of homemade chili verde that was fantastic.  Service was terrific, understood we had a plane to catch, food came out quickly and check was promptly taken care of.  

As you travel through Phoenix, bring your appetite and definitely explore some excellent replicas of true Phoenician restaurants that native desert rats like myself enjoy daily.  Cowboy Ciao is high on my list-well done!"}
{"text":"This place is classic scottsdale. Great food and atmosphere and you HAVE to try the cowboy salad. We have been here a half dozen times and always have a good experience. Service is always quality and the food is even better. Give it a shot you won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"Alright, this place has been reviewed probably enough times for my review to not blow your mind with knowledge. But hey! I love writing reviews, it almost warrant's how much I eat just to tell you how awesome it is (and you know, cause food is awesome).

My experience at Cowboy Ciao was a prospective/struggling foodie's DREAM in the making. My friends parents invited me and 8 of my friends (yeah imagine that chaos) for a fabulous dinner (i.e. he was cuffing the bill). He kept ordering us cocktails, bottles of white and red wine and every appetizer known to man. We were there drinking, eating and laughing for 4 hours, and I can surely say it was worth every minute of it. 

Heaven. This is foodie heaven. I'm not even ashamed to say this is all the stuff I ate:

STETSON CHOPPED (Salad)
Its the reason why most people come to Cowboy Ciao, yet the ingredients aren't even listed on the Menu. Never fear, Yelper in need, here is what is in the famous stetson chopped: Israeli (pearl) couscous, Roma tomatoes,super-sweet dried corn, arugula, smoked salmon, asiago cheese, toasted pepitas, dried black currants. Dressing: buttermilk ranch $13

Since this is a fancy schmancy restaurant, the server will toss the salad for you and use half of the dressing, which is all you need to get the creamy, crunchy, sweet, salty, weird-yet-delicious mixture that is this fascinating salad. There is salmon, there is veggies, there is couscous, there is everything you could want in a motherloving salad, and this one, this ones the freaking best.

PORK BELLY & WAFFLES
A fancy take on chicken and waffles, the pork belly was tender and delicious but the 5-spice waffle was just a plain waffle that lacked sugar. The appetizer was topped with an alternative-syrup that made the sweet and salty dish super successful. Hmmmm, tasty tasty calories  

MAC AND CHEESE
This is supposed to be a \"different take\" on the traditional M&C but the taste is pretty standard. The spiral noodle is al dente and the brie makes the texture very creamy but super mild in flavor. I would have loved some stronger cheeses (asiago, goat, blue) or spices to kick it in punch. At $7 its a small cup of noodles that works great as a side dish or as a tiny appetizer for 2 people. Hmmmmm cheeeese.

QUESADILLA DEL DIA
Or queso-dila of the day for those that don't speak the language. This one was filled with (what I think was) pulled pork filling which was tender, blasting with flavor and topped with a creamy creme fraiche on a toasty quesadilla. Although it just was one shell folded in two, the meat filling was so..errr.. well, \"filling\" enough to be a meal of its own. Easy to say, best quesadilla i've ever had. Hands down.

DUCK CONFIT
Questionable presentation, amazing flavors. It was hard to actually recognize it as \"duck\" because they place a laaarge layer of cotija cheese on top that melted and covered the entire dish. Now, don't get me wrong, i looooooooove me some cheese, but this dish didn't need it, or it didn't need so much of it. The duck that I discovered under the cheese bed was cooked well and was quite tender, but the green bell pepper at the bottom was under-cooked and unnecessary for the dish. Great flavors but weird execution in some of those component.s

SALMON ENTREE
A giant piece of crispy salmon on top of arugula salad and veggies. The salmon was zesty/limey, tender and a had the perfect amount of salt. This is a protein-health-concious' dream: tons of perfectly cooked protein with simple ingredients, tender veggies and not a carb insight. Freaking fantastic and pretty guilt free.

PARTY MOUTH DESSERT
Meh, not the \"Big finish\" that I would need at the end of the feast just described above. This dessert was like a sticky pecan bar served with vanilla ice cream and a crispy cookie. It was overly sweet, sticky and nutty- and extremely hard to cut with a spoon. 

Drinks, Service and More
We drank. A lot. More than anyone should really ever allow us to, but oh well. I ordered a traditional Moscow Mule because their signature \"Mezcal\" version seemed a little too weird for me. Then we had two bottles of white, 3 bottles of red (all recommended by our server because we were too lazy to read the giant wine bible) and some grapas to finish off the meal. All our cocktails and wine selections were excellent and had a constant refill by our server. Our server managed a loud, needy and drunken table of 12 adults behaving like college students on a free meal. He was great when we asked him for suggestions and patient while we figured out what we wanted to do throughout the meal. 

I can't imagine what the total came out to (10 cocktails, 5 bottles of wine, 12 shots of grapa, 6 appetizers, 14 main entrees and 1 dessert), but I am happy I had this one chance to get so spoiled on the food and booze I love so much. The foodie in me was in foodgasm heaven. The healthy-small-portion eater in me had a really bad stomach ache the next day. Woops."}
{"text":"You just can't go wrong. I recommend it to any and all friends that ever go to Scottsdale (we lived here before) and most definitely make it for dinner every time we visit! I literally dream about the Stetson salad!!!!"}
{"text":"I travel all the time.  Great food in an airport is hard to find.  Fantastic food, perfect service, reasonable price!!!  Huge fan. Upper Manhatten was perfect"}
{"text":"We've eaten here 3 or 4 times - every time we visit from MI - and it's terrific.  The menu is unique from start to finish.  Their Stetson chopped salad is justifiably extolled by others on this site.  It includes arugula, smoked salmon, pepitas, black currants, sweet dried corn, etc. and has an awesome pesto buttermilk dressing.  And, just ask and they'll give you the recipe to take home.  Cowboy Ciao has a fun vibe, casual, and the employees seem to like working here.  Service has always been very good.  The server will take the time to explain items of interest on the menu.  Oh, and they have a creative mixed drink list and a better-than-average wine list as well.  I had the rainbow trout served with black truffle risotto and fresh vegetables.  Desserts are not to be missed.  I had \"rolo ole\", a chocolate tart served with macerated citrus fruits and homemade ice cream which was delicious.  My husband's dessert was even better -- I forget the exact name, something about Elvis -- with chocolate and bananas and peanuts.  Truly decadent and delicious.  I'd eat here every night if I could and would give it 6 stars if I could.  That good."}
{"text":"3.25- This was my second time there, it had been awhile since my last visit. I ordered the duck sandwich (baconapplewood-smoked duck breast on marble rye with arugula, bacon, double crème brie
and caramelized chipotle/granny smith apples, served with chilled roasted yam salad) the g.f. got the stetson chopped (sushi style salmon, roasted corn, roma tomato, basil dressing, trailmix, arugula, asiago cheese, couscous) she didn't care for it much..said it could have been a nice side. I enjoyed it. There were many flavors and textures-acidic yet easy on the palate. The duck gave me that \"next day micro's chx taste/smell) threw me off. But the apple and brie combo was great and the bacon was good. Also rye was really soggy, didn't hold well.  Sandwich came with aym salad which was just okay. Had some green chiles and was like a blah sweet potato. We also ordered a side of mac n cheese. Came with a tomato relish-okay. Mac n Cheese was average, wouldn't order again. It was dry and flavorless to be frank.  

All in all, I will not be back for lunch..there are far too many options in that area."}
{"text":"Amazing meal to start a night out in Oldtown. Broused the great beer and wine selection over bruschetta with a twist: some had marinated mushroom topping which I rather enjoyed. Dinner was served quickly considering the size of the crowd. I had the Sugar Smoke Shank which was very good, though a little spicier than I expected. The star of the show, however, was my wifes Pastrami Style Short Rib. Just order this. It's exactly what it sounds like, which is amazing. Seriously, don't leave here without some of this in your belly. Overall a great place for dinner if you're into that sort of thing."}
{"text":"I have been looking forward to trying Cowboy Ciao ever since my boyfriend visited Phoenix earlier this year. He needed a dinner recommendation, I told him I'd seen good things about Cowboy Ciao, and the next thing I know, he comes home raving about this mythical brown butter ice cream and bearing gifts of delicious bacon-caramel-chocolate popcorn. Clearly I had to try Cowboy Ciao for myself.

Thankfully, it lived up to the months-long hype! First, our server was fantastically good at his job. That wine list is insane, but he told us we could tell him what we were looking for and a general price range, and he would find something we liked. And he did! The mixed drinks were great too - one of my friends had what she claimed was the best martini of her life. 

Second, the food was aaaah-ma-zing. I now understand why the menu lists a rave review rather than a description of the famous chopped salad. We split it as an appetizer for the table, and it was utterly fantastic. Best salad of my life? It's possible. We also ordered a mac and cheese for the table, and it was good too - though I felt a little sorry for it, having to share table space with that chopped salad. I confess we neglected it a bit. Sorry, mac and cheese.

As for dinner, we all went with small plates which were generously portioned and certainly enough for a meal. I had the crab enchiladas, which were heavenly. One of my friends wasn't too enamored of her scallop and beet risotto, but I tried it and liked it. Not as good as my crab enchiladas, but still a solid dish.

By now, I'm sure you've guessed that I HAD to order the blondie with the brown butter ice cream.  We also ordered a bread pudding, which I thought would be my favorite, but I was wrong. I'm not usually a blondie fan, but this was really special - generously portioned, warm, and perfectly crumbly. Our waiter even gave us an extra scoop of the brown butter ice cream since he knew how excited I was to try it. How nice!

The best part? It wasn't even that expensive. Ordering small plates as a main course certainly saved some money, but even with two appetizers, wine, and two desserts, I was pleasantly surprised at the final tally. We had a great evening, wonderful service, and fantastic food. I will definitely be back the next time I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"I was skeptical about how their Stetson chopped salad could truly be \"the best salad I ever ate.\" And boy, I had no reason to be skeptical. This salad is DYNAMITE and I'm already planning my next trip back."}
{"text":"We stopped in for lunch since we found a parking spot on Stetson Drive.

I enjoyed my seared ahi tuna sandwich immensely.  The bread had lots of sunflower seed on the crust.  The tuna was perfect and the extras inside were perfect.  The rest of the gang had short ribs, bacon sandwich, sliders filled with pork belly, and hamburger plate.  Everyone was happy with their meal.

Service was quick and friendly.

On the way out, I had to buy a few bags of caramel popcorn with chocolate and bacon ($7 per bag).  Wish I had grabbed a few more since the bags were on the small size."}
{"text":"Got here pretty late, probably around 1030PM. It was pretty quiet at that time not a whole lot of people. Ordered the filet mignon and let me say it was good, if your steak love then give it a try. The vegetarian mushroom dish was good, I had a few bites from my best friend next to me..."}
{"text":"The Stetson Chopped salad is by far the best thing at Sky Harbor Airport in Phoenix. Order it with smoked salmon instead of chicken and be blown away. Every time I fly from Terminal B I eat here when I have enough of a layover. Actually crave this salad... Superb"}
{"text":"Charlett!! Awesome service felt like I was at home, food was great too thanks!! 

Ask for Charlett..."}
{"text":"Wow. This is an airport restaurant but my dinner took OVER 25 minutes from ordering. I was told the place suddenly got busy. Not my problem. Had to take it to go for a cold meal on the plane."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants in the Valley. It's my go-to place to take out of town guests. The stetson chopped salad never disappoints, and most of the entrees are delicious (didn't much care for the capon). One recent Saturday during lunch I had scallops with beet risotto and goat cheese that was especially divine. Great wine list with some excellent selections by the glass. Service has always been prompt and friendly."}
{"text":"Best airport food EVER! Located directly across from Gate B21. I highly recommend this place! The food is outstanding!! We ordered the truffle mac-n-cheese, bruschetta and THE STETSON CHOPPED SALAD! It was amazing! I got grilled chicken instead of the smoked salmon and added avocado."}
{"text":"I just wrote a decent review but then the post errored out.  annoying!
Food - Awesome.  Service - Excellent.  Atmosphere - A bit loud.  My only issue was that our table seemed more at home in an Ikea in-store cafe than this one-of-a-kind restaurant.  All-in-all 4 stars."}
{"text":"I have been living in Scottsdale for over 10 years and I have never been to the iconic Cowboy Ciao until last weekend. I say \"iconic\" because I can't tell you how many times the restaurant has been recommended to me by locals, resort concierges, foodies, etc...  And one of the reasons I never made it in until recently was because it can be rather challenging to get a table on a weekend. When I called to make reservations for Saturday night I wasn't surprised when the hostess gave me the options of 5:30 or 9:15. I mentioned I would have to double check with the rest of my party, the hostess quickly stopped me and proclaimed that she just found a table for four at 7:45. 

We arrived and quickly ordered a bottle of wine. The wine list is vast so 5 stars for that. The app I ordered was edible. A fried mac and cheese dish with salsa for dipping. The mac and cheese was shaped like slice of meatloaf with crispy edges and the cold tomato salsa seemed fresh but  for some reason didn't  really make a good match. I actually was expecting a more decadent experience like the mac and cheese sticks from FIX at the Belaggio so I was a bit disappointed. 

My main course was the Chicken Fried Trout with sriracha aoli and cole slaw. Two issues here, the fish was soggy because the slaw was on top. The way I figure it, when you order \"Chicken Fried\" anything you want crispy right? Why put wet cole slaw all over the top? Second, the sriracha aoli was not as spicy as I would have liked, but I spent a lot of time in New Mexico so my perspective of spicy may be a bit off there. 

On a more positive note I tried my dinner companion's Stetson Chopped Salad, and that may have been one of the top 2 or 3 salads I have ever tried in my lifetime (I had a salad nicoise in Paris years ago that will always be numero \"un\" in my heart). 

Also, the stilton blueberry cheesecake desert was fantastic. There was just that faint hint of moldy, blue cheesy, salty, stilton flavor which made it very unique and quite good. 

All in all, it was a good restaurant, and the service was adequate. I just think I ordered poorly. Serves me right for ordering 2 fried dishes, but hey, it was my Birthday so why not?"}
{"text":"It has been years since my last visit and decided to check it out again for the May Restaurant Week. We had such a great experience.  We got a nice side table. Our server was just amazing (that always enhances a restaurant experience)! Our food was delicious, with enough to take home leftovers.  I had the pulled pork over polenta... it was so tasty!  I would definitely recommend Cowboy Ciao and plan to go back sooner this time."}
{"text":"My husband and I enjoyed splitting the large Stetson Chopped salad (Large is not listed on the menu).  We are both light eaters.  This was just enough, but I would split an appetizer next time. Server was knowledgeable and engaging. Restaurant needs to be updated."}
{"text":"Connecting to Oakland. Flight delay allowed me time to check out this restaurant. Got the Sangria and West Coast Wrap. Liked the homemade chips that came along with my wrap thought they could do with a little seasoning. Pleasant wait staff, knowledgeable on the menu. Prices comparable to other airport restaurants. Definitely beat the paid for meal the airline was offering. 

I'm sure I'll be passing through again and would consider returning in the future if in this terminal area but won't go out of my way."}
{"text":"We had the Mezcal drink! Great. On to the Duck confit stuffed Rellano. OMG. The best we've ever had!"}
{"text":"Cowbody Ciao has been on my list of places to try for quite some time. Tucked away down a side street in Old Town Scottsdale, for years it has been \"out of sight, out of mind\" for me, until a few weeks ago when we stumbled across it on a walk through the town. The atmosphere left a little to be desired, but the food was light and delicious! 

We weren't terribly hungry, so we decided to give the famous stetson chopped salad a try. While it was delicious, when most people think chopped salad they picture lettuce. The chopped was the only salad on the menu without a description, and so when a bowl of mainly cous cous arrived, we were surprised. It was delicious, but not what we expected. 

For a unique menu with a southwestern flair, definitely give Cowboy Ciao a try."}
{"text":"1. Airport food rarely is this good.  2. Their prices don't necessitate a 2nd on your home."}
{"text":"There's nothing like spending tons of money and receiving poor service to really turn you off a place!  It was a large group of about 20 people and I'm not positive why but the server had this annoying look from the beginning.  We were celebrating my friend's birthday so everyone was trying to overlook it and not make a scene but how awful!

First he makes a snarky comment about whether everyone won't actually be eating a meal when we went around ordering some appetizers.  Then he decides to take someone's order on one end of the table but when the next person tries to order he says he will be going clockwise from the other end of the table.  He goes straight to the guy that just arrived who of course was not ready while everyone else is groaning.  We stumbled through the entrees and were starting to feel better after eating.  I had split a few appetizers and chopped salad with a friend so the plates were between us.  I was talking to my friend on the other side of me to turn back to find that they had cleared my plate and the chopped salad that I was still kind of working on.  After the fact he asks were you still working on that?  Um.. I still had a fork in my hand!  

Aside from the annoyed, misstepping waiter that apparently was in a rush to get us out, the food was still fairly decent.  The chopped salad was awesome as usual.  The quesadilla was pretty solid as well.  The cheese plate was a little different - they drizzled honey all over it which you kind of had to work through to get to the flavor of the cheese.  The croquettes that came on the plate was not pleasant or plentiful (4 pieces?? and very hard, no seasoning except honey of course!).  Mac and cheese was very good.  The pork belly is a bit off-putting the way they sliced it - it's basically a 4\"x4\" cube they cut diagonally so it looks almost like lasagna.  The problem with this is you get a whole thick layer of white fat staring at you.  The charred bits were good and the meat was good, but not a lot of people would (should?) eat all the fattiness that's conveniently in a layer for you.  It's fairly easy to scrape off.

I would've liked to get dessert but the server seemed to be in a rush so maybe next time.  I will definitely not be going back as part of a big group for sure!"}
{"text":"Breakfast enchiladas were good but someone put the whole salt shaker in the salsa. This made them hard to eat."}
{"text":"Went Christmas week and it certainly had enough business to shuffle our unreserved party of 4 to the bar.  Nothing wrong with that, as I love hanging with the bartenders and chatting.  Unfortunately, there was a slight stench of rotten bar towels somewhere in the vicinity that was unappealing.  The food was delivered quickly and everything was just ok.  Nothing to write home about.  then we thought the dessert would be awesome.  Well, the nuts on the side were stale!!!!  The ice cream was crystallized and the blue cheese cheesecake was eh."}
{"text":"You'll see pretty much everyone in this section raving about the Stetson Chopped Salad, and granted it is an amazing combination of flavors and textures. But Cowboy Ciao is much more. 

The ambience is a perfect reflection of the Valley of the Sun - western vibe, upscale but not stuffy. Service is friendly but not overbearing, our waitress was knowledgeable about all things edible and quaffable. Some inventive house made cocktails (Pastrami and Rye w pastrami bitters and maple syrup?), and a ridiculous wine list. 

Flavors of the Southwest are reflected in most items on the menu, with some global flair tossed in. The Buffalo Carpaccio melted in my mouth, and the chili cumin rub hung out afterwards alongside the smoky aioli. My cast-iron skillet seared lamb was great on its own, but the manchego leek risotto took it over the top. My wife's chicken fried trout was so good, I ate the leftovers cold for breakfast. How does a dish go well with both Cabernet and coffee?

Four days later, back home in snowy cold Boston, we wish we were back in sunny Scottsdale. Thankfully, we have memories of Cowboy Ciao to cling to."}
{"text":"Cowboy Ciao combines Southwestern and Italian food.  Try the filet mignon with blue cheese mashed potatos.  Can't decide what to order?  Check out the nifty fifty a one page list of customers favorites.  The blueberry bread pudding is a must for dessert."}
{"text":"I hadn't been to Cowboy Ciao in over 10 years, so we decided to bring an out of town friend here for dinner.  Much has not changed inside, but truly it doesn't need to...it has a good vibe to it.  The service is great and our server helped guide us with our choices.  He recommended the (Corn) Nuts about Scallops as a starter, so we gave them a try and really liked the different tastes to the dish.  I enjoyed the grilled swordfish for my entree and was so pleased with my selection - a nice mix of flavors that weren't too heavy.  We were too full for dessert, but need to stop back in and try some of the amazing sounding desserts on our next visit in."}
{"text":"The Stetson chopped salad with chicken is my go to every time I stop in. Its presented with each ingredient piled into a line, one next to the other and is served with a pesto buttermilk dressing. The flavor combination is so good. It's definitely a one of a kind salad.

I wasn't a fan of the restaurant's version of a Moscow Mule. My server did warn me that it was different and made with a smoky liquor, which I thought I'd be okay with, however it did taste more like tequila instead of vodka, and overpowered the drink. Very much the opposite of what I know a Moscow Mule to be. 

Lastly, I'm not sure why they don't serve the salad with your normal set of utensils. I'd assumed it was a one-off, but after three visits and only two large mixing spoons provided each time, I have to assume the idea is spoon feed the salad to oneself......Anyway, be proactive and order utensils with your salad, or walk to the hostess to grab a set like I did, because I don't know anyone who can eat a salad without a fork."}
{"text":"Awesome location, cool place....the Chopped Salad is by far the most amazing salad I have ever had in my life (but way...and I mean way to small)...If it were double the portion for the price I would probably visit more. I had a flight when I was there...it took forever (as I know flights are supposed to)...but this was ridiculous...the buffalo meat is so gross...it reminds me of when a stray dog visits my lawn...

The BBQ sauce is good....the staff is just OK. Nothing mind blowing. I think staff in a place with a pricey menu should spoil the guests a bit...Give away a free desert when you know the service and meal is just OK...this may bring your customer base back to visit just because you redeemed yourself at the end.

Overall its a cool place. It fits with the downtown Scottsdale lifestyle. But stay away from the buffalo, because it will give doggy bag a whole new meaning...."}
{"text":"I was introduced to this place years ago on business. I make it a point to visit whenever I am in Scottsdale. As noted the Stetson salad is delectable as the rest of the fare is interesting and delicious. Great ambiance. Easy and casual. Always wonderful service."}
{"text":"Brisket appetizer was super fatty. The tiger prawns were good. The service was poor for the price of the food. Dessert ice cream flight was good. Glad I finally went but probably won't go again, prices way to high for amount and quality of food"}
{"text":"I'm still not sure what I think of this place.  It is just a weird place to me.  I think the food is very odd...creative...but very odd...oh and random.  I've only been here twice and both my experiences were pretty much the same.  Friday night I came with a large group of people and the service was pretty good considering the size of our party.  It wasn't perfect but it was ok.

* Mac n' Cheese - I was very excited to try this but it wasn't good at all.  Not creamy, not cheesy, not bacony, not anything.  Very disappointing.  It lacked any real flavor and it was almost like they leave it out to become stale on purpose.  I didn't even eat the whole thing and that is saying a lot because I tend to eat everything.

* Chopped Salad - This was excellent and probably the high-point of my meal.

* Mushroom Pan Fry - Pretty much just what the menu said it would be.  It was over sauced which wouldn't have been so bad if the sauce was rich, creamy and flavorful and this just wasn't.

* Bread pudding - pretty good but not out of this world like some reviews on here make it out to be.  I would order it again though."}
{"text":"I have been going to Cowboy Ciao since it opened about 20 years ago.  The Stetson salad is amazing!  Last night along with our Stetson salads we split a pork ravioli......OMG, amazing!  Please keep it on your menu after restaurant week!  Great service too!"}
{"text":"Just to be fair, I went during Restaurant Week. So Scottsdale was busy and the restaurant was packed. We had good service, very nice waiter. We had appetizers, wild boar meatballs (no way for me, but they were devoured) unconstructed sushi, and a delicious gazpacho. It was smoked tomatoes and burrata cheese and it was the best thing about my meal. Entrees were the famous chopped salad, which everyone loved!, a few steaks with chimichurri, scallops, and I had the rellleno. It was just ok. I love the poblano chile but the cornmeal crust and filling were unappetizing. Dessert was a nice dense flourless brownie which was a nice bite. A couple of us had drinks, but were never offered a second, and that's just a pet peeve of mine. Anyway, I would go back for the chopped salad, but I'm really in no hurry."}
{"text":"I had dinner at the bar last night and it was fantastic.  I did not even make it to the Main menu between the D Crab Enchiladas and the Short Rib Risotto and 2 great wines.  All I could do was take a bread pudding to go and roll out.
Simply great.  
Next time I will grab the chopped salad deal (i think its called stetson salad) and likely their stuffed pork chop.  I may have to go back tonight.

Also loved the bar spot looking into the kitchen."}
{"text":"The food is good, nothing spectacular. Tourist trap feeling. I would give more stars if the server would have been nicer and also would have mentioned that the water she was serving is $9.00 per bottle. She brought out a bottle for each person and we did not have menus to know that they charge for this. Her offering, tap or sparkling? $36.00 later we felt weird about not being told the cost and spending that much on water. We won't be going back or recommending. I'll take our other awesome options in the area thank you!"}
{"text":"Olah Cowboy Ciao

Right in the heart of Ol' Town you find Luxurious Cowboy food. That seems right, lol

MUST GET
STESTON SALAD - WOW. This was one of the best salads ever. Smoked salmon, dehydrated corn, parsley, pumpkin seeds and cous cous. like crazy good

OVER-HYPED
PAN FRY MUSHROOM - eh. VERRY CREAMY. Like OD heavy cream. i loved the mushrooms, all of the different varieties were delicious. But it was just super super heavy, barely finished half while i knocked back a wine flight ;D It was good but temper your expectations.

My co-workers got steaks, And boy were they some hefty pieces of steak. Very generous portions. Plenty of craft beer options too

Phenomenal service. Very dimly lit. Quiet on weekdays. Try to snag that monstrous table nook in the cave! See pic!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for a date night on 6/28/08 and it met all my expectations by far.  The food was to die for.  We both can't wait to go back.  I had some pomegranate green tea to drink that was really yummy.  Then we shared the Stetson Salad.  I am a vegetarian so they substituted the chicken or salmon for chunks of avocado.  Yummy!  This was just the best chopped salad every.  I don't think I can remember everything in it but the many different colors, shapes and textures were just thrilling.  It had dried corn, couscous, the avocado, lettuce.....and some pesto ranch or something like that...

For dinner I had the mushroom panfry.  I have to say that I am not a huge fan of mushrooms.  I like them but I don't love them.  That said the waitress said it was the best vegetarian option and the reviews on it were so good that I went ahead and got it.  It has like 14 different kinds of mushrooms all cooked together in a tomatoey sauce with a couple triangles of polenta to eat with it.  It was good.  I was impressed.  Now I don't think I would order it again but that is just because mushrooms aren't really my thing.  If they are your thing I bet you will drool all over this dish.

My husband had some expresso crusted filet mignon.  He said it was one of the best cuts of steak he had in his life.  He also really liked to flavor of the coffee on it.  I had to feed him a bite just so I could experience the cutting of it with the fork.

For dessert we had the goat cheese cheesecake.  I think that is what kind of cheese it was.  I loved the filling of the cheesecake but not so much the crust or the sprinkles on top.  They reminded me of uncooked sugar cookies."}
{"text":"Looks like this meal may be the best of our trip to the west. Service was excellent, though I noted a full bus of people that came in before we left. That might have given the second seating some issues. But we were unscathed. 
   We did the chopped salad and it was good and creative. Creative is what best describes the fare. The pork belly rocked and the mushroom fry was nice, though a meal size would be too much. Jeff had had hamburger and whaoo! It was a 10 or close. A contender to Poag Mahone in Chicago!  
   We \"guilded the lilly\" with zeppoli and they were awesome, like mini Leonard's malasdas from Hawaii. Sweet!"}
{"text":"Rating: 4.5

I came here one night with classmates about 8 months ago. We walked by one night to see it PACKED. I wanted to see what the fuss was about. I'm glad I did. =) 

I was here last week again for school, and luckily my bf was in town for work so I dragged him here with me. 

I have ordered/tried: 

LEMONADE - This tasted like a mix of lemonade and limonata so it had a dash of spritz. I liked it a lot, but my bf didn't.

AHI TUNA ANTIPASTO - Good! 

STETSON CHOPPED SALAD - Holy shit, I LOVE this salad! They were NOT kidding when they said this was a serious customer favorite. It is a mix of sweet corn, salmon, marinated tomatos, Cowboy Ciao trail mix, couscous, and chopped spinach. It is so yummy! I am definitely going to have cravings for this. My bf loved this too.

MISO SPICY SQUID - This was really good calamari. It didn't have too much batter so you could actually taste the squid. And it wasn't over-fried. The pineapple salsa on top is an awesome compliment to it. 

SEARED SCALLOPS w/ DILL CREAM SAUCE & GOAT CHEESE - This was pretty tasty. I love dill and I love goat cheese; this was actually a nice combination. The scallops were cooked perfectly. 

RIB-EYE w/ AJI SAUCE - This was taken off the menu for some reason but it was cooked and seasoned perfectly (medium rare!). There was a hint of lovely and SPICY aji (Peruvian) sauce. Delicious. 

MINI MUSHROOM PANFRY- My bf and I didn't enjoy this. Although the mushrooms were cooked well, this dish had no flavor. We both love mushrooms so much and it was a disappointment that a dish with so much potential lacked flavor. 

PECAN-CRUSTED SALMON - OMG, this was incredibly delicious! My bf and I aren't really salmon people when it comes to non-Japanese food. The waiter told us that the sauce served with the salmon was really good, and that this was also a popular dish. We were so glad we took his advice. It was cooked medium-rare with a pecan crust. The combination of the sauce and light crust was so good. This is probably the only place that I would order salmon again. It was complimented with sauteed vegetables (Chinese brocoli, carrots, asparagus, onions, etc.)

FIVE-O BREAD PUDDING  w/ COCONUT/PINEAPPLE, and BROWN SUGAR/PINEAPPLE ICE CREAM - This is your typical bread pudding, except for the added coconut/pineapple. The bread pudding itself was cooked very well. Tasty and firm, not too mushy like many bread puddings I've tasted. I love pineapple and coconut together (as in Pina Colada's), but it wasn't my favorite with the bread pudding. I did enjoy this dessert though, but I prefer it plain with a fruit sorbet like at Montrio's in Monterey (the best I've had!). 

Overall, I give this place a 4.5. The extra 0.5 stars for the creativity and uniqueness of the dishes and restaurant culture. It's extremely unique and definitely a local favorite! I just wish there was a Cowboy Ciao near me that I could dine at. Each time I go to AZ, I will be sure to stop by this tasty restaurant. Fine dining that is fun as well. Service is great."}
{"text":"Very expensive, but very, very awesome. Extensive winelist, attentive waiters, delicious food, great mood lighting, wonderful location. I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Layover food choice at phx airport. 

Went with the corn salad suggested by server paired with a local beer. Great lunch. 

The corn was the dried variety which gave the salad a nice texture. The server even mixed up the salad for me which  was a nice touch especially for an airport joint."}
{"text":"Came here while waiting for a flight, and was very surprised with the flavors infused in their food as well as the service at the bar.  If you are in the Phoenix airport and you are looking for a place to get some good food, and a good cocktail or drink this is your place.  Quick friendly service!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went here on a Friday night based on another friend's recommendation.  I made a reservation for us at 7pm.  We arrived and were seated promptly.  The restaurant soon filled up, but it was not overly loud.  I ordered a glass of sparkling wine which was very light and delicious.  For food, my husband ordered the pork shank.  I'm vegetarian, so I ordered the famed mushroom risotto.  My husband loved the pork shank.  And the mushroom risotto was SO good, I was dying to lick the plate when I finished.  

We live 45 minutes from Cowboy Ciao and we wound up back there the next week, both of us ordering the same thing.  

The ONLY reason I give the restaurant 4 stars instead of 5 is that we'd love to see the food be local and organic."}
{"text":"If I could give negative stars here, I would! They have great food, our server was amazing! However, We had my nearly one year old baby with us at dinner. She's one, sitting quiet most of the time but would get excited and squeal and just be a happy baby. A table of 20 somethings complained and the host or someone looking like a host came over and asked me to take my child out of the restaurant. Let me be clear, my child was not throwing a fit, she was not crying. She was just being a happy excited baby. We've been here many times, I will never go back, and I can only hope the useless waste of space employee loses their job, as they shouldn't be in a service industry. I am amazed I was just told that my baby wasn't good enough to have a happy night with us! Our money will be spent else where!"}
{"text":"The mushroom pan fry with mixed green salad makes a nice vegetarian meal!"}
{"text":"Thanks to American Airlines, cancellation and then a delay, I had the opportunity to dine at the CC. Yea it's pricey as it's airport dining but I was pleasantly surprised at both the quality and quantity of their food. I had the their burger, bunless, and it was huge, smother with pulled pork and green chili pepper sauce. My burger was cooked Med perfect and to say I can honestly state I am done eating for the day. Saw a couple of other entrees float by our table and they looked delicious as well... Well cancelled flights suck eggs but Cowboy Ciao does not."}
{"text":"Cowboy Ciao is probably my favorite restaurant in Scottsdale.  Delicious food, fantastic service, and a great location.

The quesadilla of the day is always unique and tasty, I order it every time!

Of course, the Stetson Chopped Salad is to die for.

As far as I am concerned, you cannot go wrong here!"}
{"text":"This place is filthy. Avoid it if you don't to get sick before a long flight.  I can't believe the Scottsdale restaurant would allow this franchise to carry their impeccable name."}
{"text":"I picked to eat at Cowboy Ciao for restaurant week. With so many good choices offered during the week it was a crucial decision that I did not want to mess up. Cowboy Ciao did not disappoint. I believe I could have possibly picked one of the best Restaurant week options. Not only was the $30 price fixe menu great but for only $10 extra you could a wine flight that was a total steal and under priced. The starter section was scallops on risotto that could have been a meal itself. The two jumbo scallops were very tasty. The main course was the pastrami style short ribs on mashed potatoes with brussel sprouts. The short rib entre was flavor overload in a good way. The meal ended in splitting an angel food  bread pudding and an chocolate banana upside down cake. I liked the banana upside down cake best."}
{"text":"Salad was good, service was great. Unfortunately the apple cobbler was not only expensive ($10), but a huge disappointment. If you're tempted by it, just pour three packets of sugar on a raw apple slice and you've got the idea. 
I'd give CC another chance, but will be avoiding the deserts."}
{"text":"Pretty good for airport food. Interesting dishes. 

Pros: food is tasty and rather good ingredients. 
Cons: it's all heavy and greasy."}
{"text":"In my travels tried this place again.  No luck.  This bar + food joint is worthless, they have no purpose in the airport due to mismanagement.  Cowboy Chumps, please leave the terminal and let someone who knows how to manage a business, offer good food, and pander to high paying clients, take over.  I believe in natures method, that the weak and worthless to die off and make room for the successful."}
{"text":"Best airport food I've ever had. Ever. I had the bruschetta and a side salad. The bruschetta was two traditional ones and then two that were a mushroom version of bruschetta. So good. And then the side salad was not only large but it had blue cheese crumbles and pumpkin seeds! Holy monkeys it was good. 

The bartender was also super friendly (which is good in an airport since I came here annoyed that my flight was delayed) and he helped me pair some wine with the bruschetta! 

It turned my crap travel day into being fairly enjoyable for being stuck here for extra hours."}
{"text":"The menu here looks amazing, would have loved to try the food. Sat for over 20 minutes waiting for the waiter to take our order. Finally walked out and ate at one of the many other restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"So I was in Scottsdale over the Memorial Day weekend and all I can say is bravo to the culinary scene! Everywhere we went was not only fabulous but inexpensive! I must preface this by saying I do live in the most outrageously expensive city in the country and maybe they can take some lessons from lil ol Scottsdale! We visited Cowboy Ciao on the first night we were there based on a recommendation of a resident scottsdale-ite. Thanks Nick! We had a reservation but we decided to sit at the bar instead. It was quite lively on a Saturday night. We started with the Wild Boar meatballs with charred broccolini, chanterelles cream and truffle oil and I thought I died and gone to heaven. Now NOTHING in this place is even remotely dietetic, everything is rich creamy goodness. They give you two large meatballs, perfect for sharing. We then decided on the duck confit relleno with roasted shallots, queso Oaxaca cheddar and tomatillo salsa. This dish was also very rich but fabulous, my only complaint would be that it needed some more duck. By this time we were tiptoeing on the line of a food coma and we weren't quite ready to wave the white flag so we picked the Burrata Bonanza for our final dish. This was served last and unfortunately we were really working at getting any more food in our mouths. The portions are huge and everything is very fresh. I picked this place based on the wine book they have. It's insane!!!! The prices are great and again my only complaint is that the first 2 selections we made they didn't have. I guess you might expect that form a wine list of over 80 pages. We chose the 3 saints Cabernet which was amazing. I would highly recommend this place if you find yourself in old town Scottsdale and you're not watching your waistline."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in the valley. I moved away 5 years ago, and every time I visit I have to return for the Stetson Salad and Mushroom Pan Fry.  I love that the ambiance is casual - you can wear jeans, if you want - but the food is delicious, and they offer a wine to please anyone."}
{"text":"A very unique restaurant in the old town section of Scottsdale.  Very interesting menu and unbelievably the largest wine list I have ever encountered.  A nice combination.  

Ordered several of the small dishes.  All were cooked to perfection. and tasted very good. 

Especially liked the chopped salad  and scallops were especially good. 

Nice setting.  Friendly greeter and server.  

The atmosphere is very casual with a touch of elegance. 

Recommended for sure."}
{"text":"The star was for the second wine list - the one by varietal.

The chopped salad was disliked by my date for the smoked salmon, by me for the couscous that ruined the texture.   Barely ate any.

The blue elk taco was almost inedible - the elk was treated to an unpleasant batter frying, the beans with almost sugary... Barely ate any.

The mushroom ragout was not particularly flavorful, just a bit hot.  The fried polenta was ok, but a bit dry.  Barely ate any.

The wine was good."}
{"text":"For an airport restaurant, this was amazing.

We ordered: 
Mac and Cheese
Asiago Bread
Margarita
VIVA cocktail
Sangria

The food was to die for!
The Mac and Chesse was out of this world. Probably the best I've ever had. The Asiago bread was also amazing! It was so full of flavor, but the one thing I must say about the bread is that it's a bit messy. Also, the bread is very filling, make sure to have others to share it with.

The drinks were okay.
The VIVA cocktail was very sweet (and I love sweet)! Very overwhelming for taste buds.
The margarita was very good, just make sure to specify which kind of tequila you want.
The sangria is one for sangria lovers. It grew on me, but first sip was kind of atrocious. 

The service was really good. My waiter was extremely knowledgeable, and very kind. 

I will definitely come back here when I have to stay at the Phoenix Airport for any length of time."}
{"text":"They have a great salmon and quinoa dish that they can make gluten and dairy free. It's nice to go to a restaurant and have the staff and chefs be very accommodating. It didn't say anything about gluten-free on the menu, but when I asked they were very helpful. I have celiac and I didn't even get sick. Yay!"}
{"text":"great food... HUGE wine list (same as Kashmere)...  whatever you do make sure to get there cob salad thing (stedson chopped salad)... I substituted the salmon for chicken, but it is still out of this world... i know people that have brought in chefs from out-of-town to figure out what is in it so they can bring it home to their city... don't remember much else... but i remember i have never had anything bad since i have been going there."}
{"text":"Fine for an airport restaurant. Good service, though!

Limited menu, but with options that cover most special diets and food allergies. I had a tough time choosing from the small menu. Lamont of the foods are \"heavy\" - not something I want to eat before a long flight. There were some salad options.

Huge wine menu and a full bar. Probably a good spot for a few pre-flight drinks. 

Food was slow coming out, but it worked out fine for our flight/boarding timing (we were NOT there during a rush). It's very cramped with so many people's carry-on luggage all over the place. I think the staff could do a better job asking people to please put their luggage under their table or seat. It was very difficult to get from the entry to our table and back again, and I wasn't pulling luggage - I just had a big purse. 

Service was good -- A+ for that!

7/10ish. Would probably go back if I find myself in this terminal again."}
{"text":"Came in for AZ Restaurant Week!  For my 3 courses I had the Smoked Burracho Brisket with whiskey/cider sauce - I can't say enough good things about this appetizer, it was well prepared tender and the sauce was delicious.  I even liked the onions and pickle with it and that's not usually my thing.  Next I had the Filet Mignon which is served with garlic-roasted fingerling potatoes and a smoky béarnaise sauce.  The potatoes and sauce were excellent but the Filet fell a little flat.  It had this char smoky flavor that puts you in mind of backyard BBQ, but it lacked seasoning so even though it was well prepared this char/smoke flavor made it taste more burnt and less \"cowboy cookout\".  It was also topped with a grilled rapini gremolata... \"what ever that is\" - I tried it but didn't really love it.  The vegetable was a side of asparagus with roasted bell pepper, \"really good\" I'm stealing that idea when I grill.  Dessert was the Chocolate Panna Cotta with honeycomb candy, raspberries and a sauce, similar to a balsamic.  I really enjoyed all of the elements of this dessert, and highly recommend putting a little candy, raspberry and chocolate on the spoon at the same time... but watch out for the sauce.  It's very strong and doesn't really match, it's in a small puddle on the plate so I dunked... \"Big Mistake\"  I actually made a face!  The powerful flavor was more alarming than complementary... but might be better in small drips or drizzles.  The presentation of the food was a little weak, maybe trying to stay true to a cowboy vibe, but it came across a little like a 3 star kitchen experimenting with 5 star recipes and ultimately only earning 4 stars for taste.   A fun date night, I got to try new things, but at $$$ I'm not completely sold on going back."}
{"text":"Great airport food and they have amazing drink options. If you have the time to sit down and enjoy yourself then this is the best place to do so."}
{"text":"Solid.  
I went w/ the waitresses' recommendations & had the seared sea scallops w/ beet risotto - freaking good, and the short rib risotto - tasty but strong flavor.  I went w/ the bread pudding served up with vanilla bean ice cream & cherries.  Since I'm not a huge cherry fan I didn't hearts it galore, but many people seem to love this dessert here, as well as the short ribs, mushroom pan fry, and chopped salad.  
They also have a thorough drinks menu - incredible wine list, but I tried one of their mixed drinks w/ strawberry agua fresa.  I don't remember what else is in it - but it was really good!"}
{"text":"Our server was great...very easy going yet professional. We chose Cowboy Ciao because of the Yelp reviews and it was close to the Fire Sky resort where we were staying. I can't say I was all 'that' excited about the food here. We ordered the Stetson Chopped Salad because it was supposed to be 'all that'. It was interesting and tasty, but not to die for. I wouldn't go back just to eat it. 

We also ordered teh Exotic Mushroom Pan Fry which is a Signiture Dish for Cowboy Ciao. It also was good but lacked the pow that we were expecting. 

For dessert we had the Bread Pudding which was decadent and amazing. I'd go back just for this. 

All in all it was a nice dinner, good food, great service, but not super dee duper. It deserves three stars in my book."}
{"text":"Amazing. Possibly one of my wife and my new favorites!   We live in Denver, but have family in Phoenix. Guess where we will visit, as a regular stop?

First, let me state that the service was super. Friendly staff without being overbearing. 

We started w a beet salad and my wife ordered the Stetson chopped. Honestly, my beet salad was mediocre, but unfortunately for my wife, I spent my time fighting her for more of her salad. If it is possible to have a favorite \"salad?\"...this is it. Fresh, yummy, bits of salmon.  Pesto buttermilk dressing was light and terrific. 

For our entrees, we ordered the mushroom mix and a scallop/shrimp special. Both were delightful. The mushroom mix must have had over 4 cups of mushrooms over cornbread polenta. Seriously, that's a lotta mushroom!  Great fusion of flavors. We were full, but managed to share a piece of chocolate cake w marscapone icing. 

A definite stop in Old Towne Scottsdale!  Get reservations well in advance, it's a bummer to miss out, otherwise."}
{"text":"Went there on a Sunday and when I walked in, there was a bad smell. The restaurant was so dark, impossible to read the menu, but having read other reveiws, ordered the stetson chopped salad. Bartender asked if I wanted smoked salmon on it. Not a good choice! Too salty and fishy tasting. The salad was a solid okay, but couldn't really see what I was eating. Not a great experience."}
{"text":"Decided on this restaurant because of the amazing wine list. I had 3 bottles picked out before we arrived. None of the bottles were available. Took a long time to choose a bottle because they don't know what they have. The food was good and the server did his best. Slightly over priced, but worth a trip."}
{"text":"Love the food
Make reservations, it gets busy.

No matter how many times I come here, I still can never find it... old town scottsdale is like my Bermuda triangle.....

I especially like the sweet and savory desserts that they carry.... bleu cheese cheesecake.... chipotle chocolate souffle.... mmmmm..... me love weird food!!!

The wine and drinks are above average, with an above average price tag.

So yeah, go there for a happy hour or a special occasion, it'll be good, promise."}
{"text":"If I came to Cowboy Ciao for only the Stetson Salad, I would give them 5-Stars. That salad is extremely delicious, all of the ingredients melt into your mouth and create a delicious flavor. I also enjoyed the atmosphere of this restaurant, great date place in Old Town.

On the other hand, my mother and I also ordered a Mini mushroom dish with a short ribs entree.  The mini mushroom had a great sauce but the polenta was too heavy for the dish. Highly anticipating the short ribs smoked pastrami style was not what we expected at all.  Meat was dry and over-seasoned.  Needed to ask our waitress for additional sauce - mashed potatoes and brusselsprouts were the best part of the meal.

Service was better than average, our waitress knew the menu like the back of her hand.  Very seasoned just wish our dishes were better."}
{"text":"Cowboy Ciao at the PHX airport may be the best place I've eaten in an airport, ever.  I got to the airport extremely early one trip and camped out here. The food was impeccable and the service followed right behind. It was a win/win situation for all.

It was still early so after discussions with the bartender, I enjoyed the breakfast enchiladas. Do yourself a favor and give these a whirl. If you're not in the mood for this kind of twist, I'm sure anything else on the menu is amazing and made to perfection."}
{"text":"Korean bbq here is banging!!!!!!!!!!!!  Good cocktails, and a great wine selection for an airport.  I was not thrilled with a particular smell that came from an area where I was attempted to be seated, but, once I was moved, all was well. Delicious, come by if youre connecting here..."}
{"text":"Great healthy food at an airport.  Amazon salad.  Staff are awesome too.  Coming back here when in PHX.  A must try."}
{"text":"The buffalo carpaccio here is amazing.  It was an enormous plate with lots of delicious raw meat, crostini and blue cheese, and a big pile of greens to make me feel healthy.

The halibut was good too.  Less memorable than the carpaccio, though.

Next time I end up in the Phoenix area, I'll definitely come back."}
{"text":"Pros: fast, friendly service. This is a definite asset for an airport restaurant. If you get a seat in the back there's a huge window with views of the planes. 

Cons: the food isn't great, and it's pretty expensive. I had a chop salad, which left me feeling kind of nauseous the rest of the day. Not a great way to feel when you're about to get on a flight!"}
{"text":"Places like this make me really happy for promotions like Arizona Restaurant Week! I never would have stumbled into this place, if we hadn't seen it on the listing, and our entire group of four loved it! The ambiance was great (a little less casual than I'd realized... oops!) and the food was very good! I had the swordfish, and loved the flavor in their lemon-butter preparation. The server was very helpful with wine, and we found a bottle that worked for everyone at the table. I very much look forward to coming back and trying the exotic mushroom pan fry... someone near us had it, and it looked unbelievable."}
{"text":"The pan fry mushroom was too heavy on the cream, and our server was over eager to a fault. The bruschetta was good."}
{"text":"As locals we have dined here many times. Tonight wasn't up to the standards we have come to expect from Cowboy Ciao. It's been about 4 months since we've been in and it was pretty disappointing. We didn't have a reservation so we gladly sat at the bar. We ordered drinks which were fine. I will say the cocktail list needs work and there are better Prosecco splits on the market. We then ordered the Buffalo Carpaccio to start and our entrees at the same time just to keep things moving. Needless to say our entrees took forever. Well over 40 minutes. My boyfriend had the Swordfish and I had the New York Strip. We typically pick two things and share. The fish was good but not great and my steak was extremely tough and had 3 significant strands of sinue throughout making it difficult to enjoy. When asked how everything was we let her know that the flavor was good but it was incredibly tough. There was a lot of fat cap and tough steak left on the plate. Not a good meal at $39.00. Even worse is no manager presence at all! 
During our meal guests who sat next to us in open chairs were chastised by the bartender for sitting there because apparently the other adjacent guests were saving seats for friends. This went back and forth several minutes until the couple finally asked for the check to leave. The manager came over at this time and the couple was told \"no charge, have a good night\" as if dismissing them from the restaurant. Mind you, we heard the couple apparently saving the seats tell these guests to go ahead and sit because their friends were late. This whole interaction wasn't necessary.
Once our plates were cleared we asked for the check. This took another 15 minutes to get. Once our cards were run we noticed we didn't have my boyfriends cc slips so we had to flag her down again. Once all transactions were complete the apologies started. 
I can appreciate having a bad night or allowing a guest to fluster you. What I can't appreciate is charging prime prices for beef of this quality and then doing nothing about it. I don't expect a comped entree but what I do expect is a manager to stop by with concern and a sincere apology. A gesture of dessert or coffee would have been a nice attempt at recovery.
We have loved Cowboy Ciao for many years and hope you can recapture the service spirit that once lived here."}
{"text":"This restaurant is amazing! The eclectic vibe and originality are hard to beat! Our favorites from the night and I highly recommend the following: the truffle Mac and cheese was one of the best we've ever had; the short ribs melted in your mouth; the scallops with truffles and mushrooms were so flavorful; the chopped salad was to die for; the mushroom dish was rich and an explosion of flavor; and the bread pudding for dessert just rounded it all out. This spot nails it for unique and flavorful comfort food! I can't wait to go back, and until I do I will remember how great this meal was!!"}
{"text":"Our friends brought us here for dinner and it was such a treat! Absolutely loved the chopped salad and the grilled shrimp over corn salsa. Those were my favorite dishes and I would definitely order them again if we visited the area again. We also had scallops over sQuash, buffalo meatballs over mushrooms, chicken fried trout, mushrooms over polenta, truffled Mac and cheese with bacon and chips, pumpkin brûlée donuts and chocolate bread pudding. Everything was tasty and rich and arrived promptly. Was impressed with how many children were in this restaurant (including mine) as it is crowded and upscale, but the food was enjoyed by all and the service was accommodating."}
{"text":"So good! Based on reviews from here, I got the chopped salad and my husband got the mushroom fry.  Both did not disappoint.  My only word of caution is that the salmon option w/the salad is smoked salmon/lox not totally cooked like I thought it would be.  Luckily, I love lox so it was fantastic. 

I also got the 3 G's cocktail. Soo good! I prefer a fruity drink and I really liked the grapefruit and kick of ginger.

Overall, for our first time here,  2 great dishes and drink choices!"}
{"text":"I can't imagine why all the positive reviews. The dining area was filthy with trash on the floor, tables and chairs. The floor near the kitchen had a layer of grease. The server really had no clue. The glass of wine was overpriced and served almost hot. The water tasted like dirty dishwater. The quesadilla was greasy and had very little meat. Had it not been the only place open in the terminal for a sit down meal I would have left, but given my long flight delays I was kind of stuck. 

The manager refunded my dinner but the bad taste is still in my mouth."}
{"text":"If I could give this restaurant no stars I would! We were so excited to dine in all the local concepts in terminal 4 in the Phoenix Airport.  My husband and I chose Cowboy Ciao which is one of our local favorites. 

We were seated right away, but that's about the only positive of the entire dinner. I noticed they had a couple of all day breakfast options and even though it was dinner time, I was in the mood for breakfast. 

When the server came over I specifically asked if these all day breakfast options were truly available all day and she said yes. So we quickly ordered because we were trying to catch our flight and I ordered breakfast. 

Some time after we ordered my husband had a clear view of the kitchen line. He could see his Reuben sitting in the window. Finally our server came to inform us they ran out of biscuits to make my order.  They took so long to tell me this that I did not have time to order something else and have them prepare it before our flight.  

They brought out my husband's Reuben and because it was sitting in the window for so long it was luke warm! 

We tried to split it but it was really terrible. At this point the server came up and told us the manager had graciously offered to comp our ice teas for me not being able to eat. He never once asked how we liked the Rueben that was mostly untouched left on the plate. 

We were unfortunately forced to pay for the Reuben and left hungry! Pathetic!! But the worst part was we stopped at McDonald's a couple doors down to grab something so we wouldn't starve on the plane and I made eye contact with the manager of Cowboy Ciao while we were standing in the McDonald's line. 

So not only did we have to pay for something that was terrible, the manager saw that we were still hungry and still did nothing to try to fix the situation! Stay clear of this place it is definitely not like the Cowboy Ciao in Old Town!!"}
{"text":"Rob was an absolute tool when trying to cancel reservation within an hour. I've been here many times with clients and family and have never been treated with such disrespect.  These guys need to learn manners and customer service. I will NOT be going there again!!"}
{"text":"Had dinner here recently for a family function. Great quality food, a little crazy of a menu. Atmosphere was intimate. Great service."}
{"text":"A great mix of eclectic very good food. I always have a hard time deciding because everything sounds so good. Love the wild mushroom dish. professional & knowledgeable staff. Creative wine flights showcasing hard to find wines from around the world."}
{"text":"Drove into town from the resort to look for another restaurant, which was closed for Memorial Day so ended up at Cowboy Ciao, which ended up being a surprisingly enjoyable meal!

We started with the house salad with tomato dressing which was just a salad but the dressing was unique. The couple next to us at the bar got the chopped salad which DID look unique, have to try that next time. We then got the pork belly and the famous mushroom dish. Pork belly was ok but I expected more (chefs usually worship pork belly so it was a bit of a let-down with a simple asian cucumber salad and not enough flavor), but the mushroom dish was completely amazing! Didn't taste vegetarian (which I'm not obviously) but it was wonderful mushroomy goodness, worth going here for that dish alone! I also tried the \"steak and potatoes\" martini which had potato vodka and a fried slice of bacon, which was unique and certainly got me drunk but I certainly wouldn't make it my go-to drink. Worth trying if you like vodka martinis.

Overall, the service at the bar was great and really enjoyed the meal - great stuff!"}
{"text":"We took friends during restaurant week and the food was outstanding. Save room for chocolate dessert with bacon bits. All four of us thought it was the hit of the evening. Only down side was the staff at the front desk. After being seated next to a very noisy group of six men we asked to be moved. It was 6:00 and the place 
 was almost empty and we had to ask two desk staff and they gave all sorts of excuses not to move us . Finally after indicating we would leave because we could not carry on a conversation, they moved us. That table remained empty till the party of men left .
The rest of the service was wonderful but front desk staff should be retrained."}
{"text":"Awesome creative menu at a reasonable price for an airport.  I had the \"pig n pudding\" /pulled pork over polenta.  Best airport food o have ever had and I travel a lot!  Highly recommended this place.  In the B terminal at the Phoenix airport."}
{"text":"This review is easy to break into separate parts.

The food gets 5 stars.  Delicious.  I had the filet.  Prepared exactly how I wanted, very tender, very tasty.  The potatoes with it were wonderful.  Couldn't have asked for anything more.  

The service was 1 star.  We had a party of 10.  Waitress didn't stop by to get drinks for a good 15 minutes.  The drinks took forever when we finally did order them.  Then, she had the audacity to tell us that they had another reservation and we would need to \"speed things along\".  When the food came, the filet did not come with a steak knife.  I had to get by with a butter knife until the server finally came back around again.  The consensus at the table was the serve was unfriendly, snotty and rude.  

The beer list was disappointing.  Outside of 2 beers on draft, everything is in a bottle.  That's fine.  But $8 a for a bottle is not fine.  Obviously, I expect to pay more for a craft beer at a bar/restaurant than at the convenience store but I do not expect to pay the same price for 1 bottle as I would a 6 pack at the store.  Gouging.  The food prices were not offensive but the beer prices were.  

The atmosphere is lacking.  It is cramped.  You have to walk single file through the restaurant, one direction a a time.  Not enough room to walk side by side or have someone come at you form the opposite direction.  It is VERY LOUD in there too.  A lot of background noise.  Could hardly hear the people at my own table unless they were next to me. 

If not for the food itself (which is really why anyone goes anywhere) this easily would have been a 1 star review.  Its really too bad the other aspects of this place couldn't match the food."}
{"text":"Still daydreaming about the food. Best ever! A little pricey but worth every penny. Convinced I need to include Cowboy Ciao on my list of monthly must eat at restaurants. Yum yum yum!!!"}
{"text":"Went for a late night dinner after a day in Sedona - came in dressed casually but still clean. Asked for a table for two and was then asked in kind by the host with the broken arm if we wanted a table or to sit at the bar. REALLY?!? If i wanted to sit at the bar I would have just walked to the bar or told you were just here for drinks. Totally unimpressed, particularly since 90% of the restaurant was EMPTY. Not cool, dude.

Secondly, tell your servers not to gripe about having to talk about the Stetson Chop. It's probably the one item still keeping you in business, so when we order it and say we love it (we're out of towners so it's a once a year thing) please don't sigh heavily and tell us that you're tired of talking about it. Seriously. Not cool.

Maybe business is slow, maybe management is cranky and it's trickling down to staff, but despite the fact that you have decent food, there are plenty of places in town that can rival your food and have far better atmosphere and certainly much more attentive and respectful service. I would like to keep coming here as we've been doing so for many years but honestly that last visit was so disappointing."}
{"text":"So we got off the plane, checked into our hotel and walked over to Cowboy Ciao for dinner.  I was expecting a bar/grill for some reason.  But was pleasantly surprised at the upscale fine-dining atmostphere.

Wife and I had the chopped salad.  It was very good.  I am lactose intolerant so the waitress held out the cheese.  I have to say, the reviews are right on with this one. Delicious!  I could totally eat a salad by myself.

Then came the pork belly over waffles appetizer.  Wow!  I've always liked pork bellies, being Asian, I love fat.  This is amazing!  Salty, smoky, fatty deliciousness that melts in your mouth.  The waffles just adds to the experience.  It's rave in my mouth.  :)

For my main course, I had the pastrami-style short ribs.  Jeez!  Wow!  BIG plate with succulent, juicy, perfectly cooked short ribs.  The meat is smoky, tender, and falls off the bones.  So so good!

Definitely a must-eat in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Cowboy Ciao...well...no. Yeah you have all heard the hype, excellent food, etc...! It was medicore at best. We had some small plates just to test the waters at this place. I have been wanting to try it for years and finally we got a chance to go. What a complete disappointment. We had the chopped salad, server upsold us from the $6 salad that seemed better IMO. The chopped salad was nice for about 3 bites, then it got boring. So boring I could barely taste it after the 4th bite. Not real strong in flavors, not enough salt to bring out the flavors, very blaaa!  Next we moved on to the mac and cheese. YUK! Absolutely aweful. Dry, flavorless with a hint of spice. Boring. No real cheese flavor, totally disappointed but ate it anyway. Next we had the dungeness crab enchilada's....boring!! No real taste of crab in the enchilada even though I did have a OK amount in there. All I could taste is the spicy cream sauce poured on top. Very bland, never a taste of fresh crab that would have made the enchilada. Not good at all. We did have sampler desert plate (on the house) which was very good. The mousse was great, cheesecake was excellent but I was slightly disappointed again in the bread pudding that is so talked about. Not very flavorful, little dry and the compote overpowers the bread pudding, sorry but vanilla ice cream alone works best.
Overall, totally disappointed. Will never go back. I have had better....way better for the same price. Service was great though, our watress was wonderful."}
{"text":"Slow service. Took two hours for dinner for 10 people after telling the waitress we had plans afterwards and we were in a hurry. One persons food (ahi tuna) was cold. We got pork chop and it was average. Chopped salad was good but not that great when you had to wait 40 minutes for an appetizer. Only come here if you don't mind waiting an hour for appetizers then another hour for entrees. Brutally slow. Too bad too bc our waitress was really friendly and seemed on top of things. I am assuming the kitchen was the hold up. Ridiculous and ruined our whole night (botanical gardens tickets for 10 wasted $300 worth )"}
{"text":"We were seated in the back against a plain white stone wall and in the corner. Even with a reservation. It was too loud to even try to have a conversation. 
The Stetson salad is good. The beet salad was ok but not enough beets to make it a beet salad. Shrimp small plate was good but served in a cold bowl. 

I think this place is good but very stuck on themselves. 1800 bottles of wine is impressive but at these prices they are not reachable. You are probably best off to give your server a color and price point and wish them luck. We had the flights and would have been better off with a server recommendation. 

The noise and somewhat stale menus will allow us to try a new place next visit. 

I think it is worth a first try but don't over think it. Wear what you got on and hope for a good table."}
{"text":"Cowboy Ciao used to be a spot I went to about 8 or 9 years ago.  I decided to go there again due to nostalgia reasons, and it didn't live up to my expectations at all.  

To start off, the food was not as great as it used to be.  The scallops had a sour after taste to them which I attributed to being in the smoker way too long, and they needed a better sear.  The wild boar meatballs needed more seasoning. The duck confit relleno was pretty good, but the batter was oily and fell right off the chile.

Next off, we got seated in the brightly lit room to the left as you walk in.  The room resembles nothing of the ambiance of the rest of the place.  I was turned off by the faux wall artwork.  The waitress seemed rush every time she came to us, and it showed with her missing our mushroom pan fry order.

It's hard to explain what it was like being there.  Have you ever gone to a restaurant, and you just wanted to leave after being there for 10 minutes?  Bad service, so so food, and being in a room that reminded me of the olive garden leads to wholly bad experience.

With so many other good restaurants such as NOCA, FNB, Herb Box near by, I won't ever recommend this place to anyone again."}
{"text":"We make it a point to stop in at Cowboy Ciao when we are in Scottsdale.  The restaurant is unpretentious yet the food is eclectic and consistent delicious.  The Stetson Chopped salad is a unique \"must\" and we tend to enjoy the grazing menu to leave room for dessert.  The Cereal Killer with Frosted Flake ice cream (!) is another must-try.  The wine list is more than 60 pages for selection --- overwhelming for most diners, I'm sure, however the in house sommelier can steer you toward anything your group may desire at just about any price point."}
{"text":"Here's an oxymoron for you: amazing airport food. Wha what? Would probably only give it 4 stars but the fact that it's in an airport definitely bumps it up. 

Entrepreneur Magazine named it one of the best new airport restaurants and with good reason. The food is delicious. The service is a bit slow, but overall a great experience. 

The chop salad is phenomenal. Definitely have that. You can sub stake for a $6 up charge. Totally worth it. And next time I'm planning on adding avocado. It's a bit spendy, but good food on travel is honestly priceless.  

Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"With a name like Cowboy Ciao, I wasn't quite sure what to expect when I heard we were coming here for dinner. Is it American food? Is it BBQ? Is it Italian food? I was pleasantly surprised to see that it's American food with a twist. Their fun menu seemed to have a little bit of everything.

I came here with my boyfriend and his family, who had been here before, so they knew what to order. We shared:

-Wild Boar Meatballs
-Seared Scallops & Beet Risotto
-Grilled Black Tiger Shrimp

My favorites were definitely the wild boar meatballs and the grilled black tiger shrimp. The meatballs came in a cream sauce with chanterelles mushrooms and broccolini...so flavorful! The grilled tiger shrimp was also really delicious and they were huge pieces of shrimp - you could really taste the smokey flavor. The scallops were also pretty good but they didn't stand out as much as the meatballs and the shrimp.

We had heard so much about the Stetson chopped salad so of course we had to have that. Unfortunately for me, I couldn't have the original pesto dressing since I'm allergic to pine nuts so I had the salad with a tomato vinaigrette. The salad came with couscous, tomato, smoked salmon, pumpkin seeds, corn, and spinach. I'm going to be honest and say that it wasn't quite what I was expecting and while it was good I just didn't see what all the fuss was about. Oh well, moving on...

The boy and I decided to share the filet mignon with potatoes and veggies and topped with a dungeness crab cream sauce. We had it prepared medium-rare and it was perfect. It's definitely up there with the other filet mignon's I've had. I also really appreciated that they gave us our own individual plates and split the filet for us!

For dessert all of us shared a few plates, we had:

-Spumoni Americano
-Birthday Cake
-Creme Fraiche Cheesecake
-Apple Cobbler (not sure on the actual name)

My favorites were the spumoni, birthday cake and the apple cobbler. The cheesecake went so fast that I didn't get to have a piece so I can only assume that it was good!

Overall, I would definitely come here again. The service was great; the staff gave awesome recommendations and always kept the wine flowing. Food is eclectic and delicious and I can see why Cowboy Ciao is so popular."}
{"text":"Best airport restaurant I have ever been to.  The food was amazing, and my waitress, or culinary guidance counselor was great.  Her name was Jennifer.  She was helpful, sweet and gave great advice! 

She steered me to the corn nut scallops and bruschetta duo.  This was not her first recommendation, mind you.  She gave a suggestion, listened to my response, asked a few questions and sent me to the promise land of culinary delight!  Super amazing service and food, all in an airport restaurant?  Are you kidding me?  Oh, and try the real james margarita!"}
{"text":"Had a great dinner on a Thursday evening. The chopped salad was garnished with steak for a $3 add....had it and enjoyed every bite. Steak was done to perfection.

My wife's order was screwed up (the waiter put in for the filet instead of the flat iron steak she ordered). Our waiter immediately noticed before she had to bring it up, fessed up it was his mistake, made it right, and comped her meal. The guy in charge came over, very friendly and low key to make sure she was OK with her meal. She ended up getting the basmati rice as a side with the filet mignon and had a great meal. 

So far, best dinner we've had in Scottsdale. Great service, great food. It got crowded, all the other patrons looked real happy too."}
{"text":"Service was ok, food is good but very pricey considering there are a lot more options to choose from, restaurant is old and needs an update."}
{"text":"My Sr. Manager (who is not from Phoenix) really hyped up Cowboy Ciao and their Stetson salad. It all started when he asked my coworker, who is from Phoenix, what the quintessential Phoenix/Scottsdale restaurant was. Hint hint, my coworker's reply was not Cowboy Ciao. 

Because we had a few other team members from out of town, I made a reservation for 6 for dinner. We shared a few of the appetizers including the scallops, the salad, and the bread with the bacon butter. All the items were underwhelming. The salad was a salad, nothing that I would come back for. The scallops were ok, and the bread was just bread with fancy melted butter. Most restaurants would give it to you for free, but not at Cowboy Ciao. I can't speak to the other mains by the salmon I ordered. Half of it was so burnt that I couldn't eat it (as it would seriously offend my taste buds). The bed of quinoa was very bland so I barely touched that. 

Not only was the food expensive and lacking in quality, the service was extremely slow. I didn't get my glass of wine until well into the main course and I had to remind our server that I had ordered a glass of the rose. The food also seemed to take forever to come out of the kitchen.

At the end of our very subpar and expensive meal, my Sr. Manager fessed up and said that the last time he dined at Cowboy Ciao was a few years ago and he definitely sees a drop in quality. I think it's safe to say that he nor I will be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"I've had better brisket, but never as a Reuben. On my previous visit I neglected to check in but had amazing breakfast enchiladas (I've had better fried eggs but not over tomatillo sauce).

Everything looks amazing, smells better, and lives up to the olfactory expectation it sets. The sauces are fresh tasting, not over-vinegared the way puréed salsa so often are. You can tell they're beginning with fresh ingredients and high quality cuts of meat. If I were ever in a part of Phoenix other than the airport you can bet your @$$ I'd be headed to their location on Stetson, especially if the awesome service here is a consistent factor there. 

I want to be clear, I have liked both my servers so much that when the incredibly rude couple that just left came in to sit here and eat McDonalds (seriously, what the heck? go sit at a gate like everyone else who wants to eat that garbage) I got offended that my charming waitperson had to even speak to them.

This is a four star experience and the staff makes it five, if you have to fly through Phoenix then skip breakfast to save room!"}
{"text":"Service is mediocre to say the least. Food is over priced. Staff is isn't even entirely inviting. Also didn't think you could mess up Mac and cheese but it was super gross. And cold. So to any of my friends flying from Phoenix airport, please go somewhere else."}
{"text":"My ABSOLUTELY favorite place to eat in Scottsdale, hands down.  The Rueben sandwich is exquisite and piled high with meat.  The menu has cute names and is very descriptive.  The food is fresh and of the highest quality.  The service is very good and the server is friendly, knowledgeable about the menu and very charming.

My next stop in Arizona won't be complete food-wise without a trip to Cowboy Ciao!"}
{"text":"DH & I had a groupon for Sunday Brunch at Cowboy Ciao, we were both looking forward to trying out the food their, since we've heard great things. I had the patron coffee, which was very good, DH had regular coffee, which he enjoyed. The waitress asked us immediately, if we had a groupon, so we handed ours in. I ordered the breakfast hash- sweet potatoes and short ribs, it was ok nothing special. My DH ordered the breakfast enchiladas, which were pretty good. Service was terrible as our food took longer than other people's at the restaurant to arrive. Our food was also luke warm, when we did finally receive it, after 30 min of placing the order. 
Overall service was bad, and the food was ok. No plans of going back."}
{"text":"It's not enough to be different. To offer Ukrainian Mango Fish with Jupiter Nuts and curried Venezuelan Pangopeas is nothing to crow about if it taste like, well, crow. Restaurants who live by this \"different is enough\" credo usually burn brightly then disappear quickly. The townspeople eventually let the king know he is wearing no clothes. It takes courage for a restaurant to be different and it takes real talent to do it well. When I take the time to shave my legs, do my hair and put on a new dress, I want an adventure. I'm looking for something new, something different, and nothing buried in cheese.

Last night I hung the whip from my belt, said goodbye to my monkey and left for our 9:15 reservation (yeah, that's right, 9:15) at 
Cowboy Ciao.  

Cowboy Ciao is nestled among a group of restaurants along Stetson Drive in Old Towne. You really have a lot of options if you're walking that street, but none will give you what you will experience at Cowboy Ciao. 

Let's start with the hostess stand. It's the end of the dinner rush, yet when we enter we are greeted with a burst of enthusiastic attention that makes me feel much more important than I deserve. If I'd gotten this kind of treatment on our first date it might not have taken so long for Tammy to...nevermind.

Tammy's entrée was the special, seared Diver's Scallops in a braised beef reduction with mushroom.  The scallops were perfectly cooked, tender and sweet. The beef and seafood flavor pairing was startling for the first second, then together with the mushroom they melded together in such harmony, well if it were 1962 Liverpool, Brian Epstein would have put suits on them and booked them on the Ed Sullivan Show.  

I had a braised pork shank over fingerling potatoes and a cranberry walnut chutney. Excuse me a moment while I blot the saliva from my keyboard. Okay. The shank was fork tender, and the chutney, this little knot of heaven perched atop the shank, could make you forget a foreclosure. The richness of the nuts, the sharp bite of the cranberries put me in a trance. As if this weren't enough, this rapturous shank sat on a bed of fingerling potatoes nestled in a rich cheese sauce. This dish is pure, unadulterated comfort. As comforting as watching \"It's a Wonderful Life\" in a snowy cabin, in front of a roaring fire, on Christmas Eve, with Burl Ives humming carols during the commercials. Are you feelin' me?

If it's possible, the only thing as good as the food is the service.  When the staff at Cowboy Ciao gets through with you, you will gladly, enthusiastically give them the keys to your beach house, you will drive them to the airport, you will help them move. Whatever they need, because they have tried, and I'm pretty sure succeeded, in listening to you and then giving you everything you need. They navigated us through the 3200 different wine labels and the nearly 30,000 bottles, to two glasses that paired perfectly with our divergent entrée's. (Incidentally, the wine they recommended was only $12 a glass, and that for a nice pour. Not bad when they also offer wines at around $30 a glass.) 

Now for the R-rated appetizer.  You might want to dim the lights, lock the door and wedge a chair under the knob.  Cowboy Ciao's menu is peppered with guest quotes. The quote that accompanies this dish is, and I quote \"That Mushroom dish is so good, I wanted to take my clothes. .\" I like to think it was said by an attractive woman. It is called the Exotic Mushroom Pan Fry.  Cremini, button, oyster, cepe, lobster, black trumpet, shiitake, morel and yellow foot mushrooms bathed in ancho cream over double-cooked polenta, topped with grilled portabellini, avocado, tomato and cotija cheese. Enough said.  Now unlock the door, smoke a cigarette and go to bed"}
{"text":"Good food but horrible service. It took over 20 minutes to get coffee and never offered a refill. Typical airport restaurant with people coming and going but just not enough servers or help."}
{"text":"I tried this Scottsdale restaurant on Wednesday night at 7pm which was a very false thing to do to come in to this restaurant at dinner time without having reservation cause the restaurant is fully packed. But the host still put us into the wine table which is very small and not really convenient to eat dinner cause my table located in the very corner. I ordered Grilled Salmon and the special of the day which is Sirloin Steak. The food was excellent. My grilled salmon was the most delicate and melt-in-your mouth-food that I ever tasted. And the Sirloin steak was great. They cooked it perfectly and as order. Overall I am satisfied with the food but not so much with the service that I got from the front host. Thank God I still got a good waiter that even though it's fully packed and busy as hell he still taking care everything fast. I'll be back for the food. But next time I make sure i make my reservation for sure!"}
{"text":"Went here with an out of town friend because his wife was raving about the chopped salad she had years ago. After much hesitation on my part, I gave in since said he said he was paying (everyone has their price). My buddy was warned by the waiter that the $12 chopped salad was not meant as a meal (maybe it was years ago) and viola, a small chopped salad arrived. Needless to say, he left the restaurant hungry. 

I had their $30 sliced steak special served on a bed of corn and beans with a honey type sauce. I took a few bites, it tasted good but I started to ponder, where have I had this meal before? Oh yeah, Chipolte's steak burrito bowl sans the rice.

In summary, the food was good, the service was excellent but I've experienced better at a lower price point than Cowboy Ciao."}
{"text":"I went with a friend on the high recommendation of another friend.  It was a huge mistake.  The food was overpriced and the server acted as if  she did not really care if we ate there or not.  The poor experience started off by requesting water.  We were told they only offer tap or you have to buy bottled water.  You pay their prices for a meal and you only get tap water?  Even the server said she would not drink it.   
Speaking of server, she made no effort to offer menu suggestions and when asked for her favorite she replied they are all good.
The famous Stetson Salad was such a disppointment that my friend hardly ate half.  She told the server who ignored her comment.  The Bruchetta were small and  umremarkable.  The only good thing was the salad dressing!  There are so many wonderful restaurants in Scottsale but this is not one of them."}
{"text":"Cowboy Ciao is located in the downtown arts district in old town Scottsdale. If you can't find a parking space don't worry because there is a nearby free parking garage. They serve up American chow with global accents in a casual but slightly upscale shabby chic environment. One specialty might be the catalog of wine they offer. You will be there all night if you read the whole catalog. We tried a bottle of wine and we liked it so we looked it up online and found that they really didn't charge too much more over the online price so maybe you can get a similar deal.

My rating is based on one Restaurant Week dining experience.

I started with the Squash Blossoms. They were light, seemed oil free and were packed with unusual ingredients like huitlacoche. They were so tasty I could have eaten a big bowl of them.

My husband had the duck skewer. I didn't taste it but my husband said it was seasoned nicely but was bloody rare. He might have sent it back but nobody asked how it was so he just ate it anyway.

We shared the Famous Mushroom Pan Fry and everyone is telling the truth...This really was a delicious dish. Very mushroomy and tasty. You could slap it on a dirty old sneaker and it would be delicious.

We were right in the middle of enjoying the mushrooms and our waiter squeezes our dinner plates on the table. My husband says something like I guess our dinners will get cold and the waiter doesn't say a word....Timing was slightly off and it made us feel sort of rushed at that moment.

My Ahi Tuna was interesting with Jerk Seasoning. I thought there were a lot of flavors there. I tasted a piece of my husband's Hanger Steak. It was tasty and the black garlic potatoes were good too. 

For dessert we had the Brookie Sundae and the Peach Brioche Bread Pudding with Bourbon PralineBrown Sugar Streusel. Both desserts were good but the flavors and textures in the bread pudding were more exciting than the Brookie but both were good.

You might want to know that the temperature is different in various locations in the restaurant. By the windows it seemed like a good 20-30 degrees hotter than near the ladies room where it seemed very cold.

Sure had a Blast at Cowboy Ciao!"}
{"text":"Best restaurant food I've ever had.  The shrimp was amazing, the wine was good, the service was good.  We sat way too long and got no attitude.  Yup!!!"}
{"text":"Great food and service. An enjoyable experience. The Ahi was excellent. The Gaspacho was awesone, as good as any I have had in Spain.  The kitchen is a bit slow when the crowd is large, but I must admit - the food was worth the wait. I would definitely dine there again!!"}
{"text":"Second time at Cowboy Ciao. I'm just flat out addicted to the Stetson Salad. Aside from eating off my husbands plate, that's the extent of my food knowledge here. And yes... it's as good as they say. 

We live in Chandler and like the drive to Scottsdale. This is becoming one of our \"places\". The wine list is extensive and if the immediate staff isn't knowledgeable about the wine they will find someone who is. The ambiance isn't formal, it's laid back and fun more than formal. The down side is that the tables are really close and some of them are really small. Depending on where you sit you can be rubbing elbows with the table next to you. Not a bad thing if you're friendly :) 

I won't give it five stars as I really only eat the salad and because the service can be a tad spotty. I've noticed they have a few staff with \"tudes\". I write t it off as a Scottsdale thing. But... still not okay."}
{"text":"This isn't a good restaurant for an airport, it's a good restaurant that happens to be located in an airport. Great service, good wine list, decent prices, and delicious food.  Field greens salad was really good, and bruschetta was better than many non-airport restaurants.  Gonna hope for a longer layover in Phoenix next time."}
{"text":"I've never rated a restaurant (airport, no less) based almost solely on the personality of the person behind the bar. Just made me happy to be here with a long layover."}
{"text":"Great food and great service! (minus the snotty moody hostess that we first saw when arriving). Our server was very helpful and accommodating, even walking us over to Kazimierz afterwards. We were stuffed and very happy with the food we had: Chopped salad, scallops with beet risotto, filet mignon, pork shank, and mushroom fry. Definitely enough food for the four of us. The chopped salad was probably my favorite!"}
{"text":"I had a chance to eat here once again after a yelp event near by.  Thank you Jennifer H. and Floyd C. for the great company.   We were obviously wooed by the great menu since we managed to order four dishes after just having had dinner elsewhere.  
We ordered their revered stetson chopped salad, scallos with risotto, pork belly and mac and cheese.
The menu does change, but you can always count on the stetson chopped salad.  You can usually find some sort of pork belly dish on the menu, but this one was my favorite one from them.  The mac and cheese was great, too!.  Now for the scallops....they were nicely seasoned,  but the risotto did not taste like risotto.  It was not creamy at all!  I probably wouldn't order again, but I would love to try the shrimp and grits."}
{"text":"Had the Southwestern Chicken Wrap today. $14.50 for a wrap of lettuce and corn, and three little chunks of chicken the size of my fingertip. How hard is it for a cook to measure out the important part of a meal? ..and how do you complain while eating when you have to keep biting in to your wrap thinking you'll 'certainly' get another bite.. but be done before you do. Went well with my $3.65 glass of ice with coke.
Don't bother dining here. Stick to the expensive liquor..."}
{"text":"The cheese plate pretty much set the tone for our meal.  The servings were generous- probably about a half dozen cheeses with candied nuts, perfectly toasted baguette slices, and a sliver of a date and nut cake.  Delicious.  We ordered it primarily for baby girl but she turned her nose up after a few nibbles.  No matter, more cheese for us.

We got the signature mushroom dish, the tuna salad poached in duck fat, and, to be healthy, the grilled vegetable entree.  It ended up being a lot of food for the 2.5 of us.  Can't add anything that hasn't already been said about the mushrooms.  The tuna dish was amazing- soft, flavorful, contrasted with sauteed greens and grape tomatoes.  The portions were so generous that we couldn't even finish, sadly.

Our server was super cool about our cranky little girl and swiftly wrapped up our 4 plates when we had to call it a night.  I think that he felt worse than we did about having to leave and he kept telling us not to worry.  My only complaint is that we had a bag of take home but no cutlery.  We've been doing too much dining out during this trip and other restaurants have been kindly throwing in plastic-ware with our doggie bags.  A minor point, to be sure.

We regret not having the time to order dessert but we did pick up some of their bagged bacon, chocolate popcorn as souvenirs.  At $7 a bag, it is a bit pricey."}
{"text":"amazing food...good service...unique menu.  Love this place!  Everything we ate was good, the atmosphere is awesome and the service is personable."}
{"text":"This place is a rip off.  They charged my credit card twice for the same business lunch and then refused to credit the card back for the second charge.  I even have the two charges showing up on my credit card statement for the same date and dollar amount.  I am now having to file a fraudulent charge through my bank to recoup their error.  Stay away from this place they are not honest people."}
{"text":"When I found out Cowboy Ciao was doing restaurant week, I jumped at the opportunity.  I had only heard great things, and with the RW prix fixe how can you lose?

You can't.

I am almost never impressed enough by a place during Restaurant Week to either want to go back or want to recommend it to others. With Cowboy Ciao, I will definitely be doing both.

I started with the famous Stetson Chop Salad and I don't think I've ever been so much in love with a salad.  The combination of salty and sweet and crunchy and creamy was amazing.  I went with another famous dish for my entree, the mushroom pan fry, and I was very pleased.  Very interesting and delicious.  For RW, the dessert offering was a trio of 2 different cookies and banana peanut butter cake, I don't believe this is on the regular menu.  One word about that cake - orgasmic.

I was so dazed off the great food, I can't even remember what my wife had for her entree, but I know she enjoyed it!

For RW, they even gave a complimentary glass of wine which is a nice added bonus not normally offered at other restaurants during RW.  Perhaps the best thing about the meal, though, was the fact that the salad and entree were regular sized portions and didn't show a hint of lower quality than what I assume you would get on an average night.  And at $29 for the three courses and glass of wine, it was a total steal.  Best money I ever spent.

The only down side with Cowboy Ciao, and I have the same problem with Kaz, is the novel of a wine list.  Firstly, my wife and I were trying to decide on a bottle and the waiter, though friendly and helpful in other areas, had no clue about any of the wines we were contemplating.  With a wine list that big, the place really needs a dedicated sommelier.  My second problem with the wine list is that it's organized by price and not by type of wine or growing region, which makes finding your choices for a specific type nearly impossible.  Want a bottle of sauvignon blanc under $35?  You've got about 30 choices, scattered through 10 pages of white wines.

So if you don't want to start your meal with a headache, stick to beer or cocktails.  Hell, just get a glass of water and let the food get you drunk."}
{"text":"There is not a lot of good food to be had in airports, and PHX has historically been one of the worst offenders in this department.  Thank God for Cowboy Ciao--this is a legitimate restaurant with real food, a great wine list, and plenty of good beers.  It's the best of both worlds:  the kind of place that you'd eat at even if you weren't in an airport, but also a place that works really well within its airport setting.  I know where I'll be stopping the next time I fly through."}
{"text":"I stopped in here on a layover hoping to find something reasonable to eat before the next leg of my trip. The little airport restaurant is really pretty with interesting lighting and lamps, a large bar, and exceptionally comfy booths.

I was greeted and taken to a booth in the corner where I was hoping I could sip some wine and while away the time till my flight. My server was super friendly and educated on gf and guided me on the few gluten free options on the menu. He knew a lot about celiac so it was awesome when he told me he'd caution the kitchen about preparing my snack in a safe place with clean gloves and utensils. 

I ordered the elote corn appetizer with corn chips and enjoyed the lovely presentation. After only a bite or two I found something in the middle of the nicely constructed elote mound that didn't belong, a fettuccine noodle. 

It was super frustrating that an ingredient that should not at all be found in this appetizer and was a huge gluten contamination after the kitchen was warned about safe food prep. Unfortunately,  I couldn't eat more and knew I would be sick in the next hour. 

I did appreciate that the manager came over and was not only apologetic but also asked how he could improve gf awareness in his kitchen. I very much enjoyed the friendliness and customer service of both the server and manager and hope that they will be able to improve the safety of their kitchen for individuals with food allergies."}
{"text":"This place is a disaster. My server is one of the worst I have seen. They cannot manage table turnover. And my \"waiter\" can only do one thing at a time. My margarita is pretty good, but the food is just ok."}
{"text":"This review is based on service only, as all I had was a glass of wine. 

This little restaurant/bar, inside terminal 4 of Sky Harbor, smells amazing and the food looks good. What really impressed me though was the service. I sat at the bar and had some wine and the bartenders were all very friendly even though the place was packed. My bartender was a dark haired woman with lots of tattoos and she was possibly the friendliest bartender I've ever had even though there were a ton of people that needed her attention. Based on my experience with her alone I'll make sure I seek out this place next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"I'm giving this three stars purely for the quality of the food. The atmosphere wasn't great, very dark then with a blinding spotlight on our table. The food wasn't bad, just most of the items were subpar at best. The chop salad definitely lives up to its reputation as delicious, and the \"famous\" mushroom pan fry was good, but certainly something we've had before. Note: the food comes very quickly, do not go to Cowboy Ciao expecting a leisurely, relaxed dinner. The prices are very reasonable, wine list is impressively affordable. Desserts leave nothing to be desired though they are strangely listed first on the menu?? Overall, not a great dining experience. We sampled several appetizers, none of which left us wanting more."}
{"text":"The best airport restaurant by far. I travel all over the country for work several times a month and I am stuck in many airports. I discovered this place a year ago and now I try to route my trips so my layover will be in Phoenix so that I'm able to come here. I always sit at the bar and if you have the opportunity to have Doug as your bartender he will always take great care of you. The Stetson chop salad is my go to favorite. I get it with both chicken and avocado (Doug's recommendation actually), and I'm never disappointed. So amazing! They have a very interesting wine by the glass menu as well. Who knew you could be at an airport bar in Phoenix and get a Pinot Grigio from Slovenia! I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Food and wine are a hit everytime we eat there.  Fun place for a lively group dinner.  Good service.  However, review bill carefully - it never fails - always an error either over (and couple times under) charging the table."}
{"text":"Went here on a date night and loved it!! 

They have a wide variety of food and wine options. Great for wine lovers. 

The location is great in old town. Plenty of parking closely. And the restaurant is so romantic and quaint. 

Food was out of this world. I got the salad because everyone on Yelp was raving about it. To die for. The ingredients were so unique and there wAs dried sweet corn in it. My boyfriend loved his dish as well. 

The service was excellent and he gave is lots of good tips on what to order. 

I would go back again and again. Perfect for a date!"}
{"text":"I am surprised by the number of great reviews for this place. My food was awful and the service wasn't much better.  It is an airport and it was a busy time of day but still.  I was seated at a counter and it was quite uncomfortable and I had to wait to order, wait for my food, and wait an interminable amount of time to get my check. I ordered the beef quesadilla and it had no flavor whatsoever and the chopped up roast beef had bigs hunks of fat in it- so unappetizing!  The waitress was nice but it was hard to get her attention and I had to flag down a different one to get my check.  Hey, I got a plane to catch, people! Next time I'll just go to McDonalds."}
{"text":"The chopped salad is to die for!  Be ready for an adventure when you are at Cowboy Ciao.  There is always something new and unique on the menu that is well worth a try. It will be worth the adventure!"}
{"text":"I came here for a business dinner and there were like 20 of us.  I did some research prior to coming out and every one recommended the Stetson Chopped Salad.  Prior to arriving I couldn't decide if I wanted to order the salad or get a steak since it was on someone else's dime.  Well that decision was an easy one since we had a price fixed menu of sorts and the salad was on there!

We had a few appetizers and they were pretty good.  I just kept waiting for that salad and was afraid after all of the wait I would  be disappointed.  That is far from the truth.  The salad came and they tell you to make sure you mix it well.  I followed instructions and ate.  I must admit it was pretty damn good.  I could make a whole meal from it.  The price fixed dinner had three choices, Filet mignon, Sword fish and their take on pork and beans.  I flip flopped forever and finally for the filet.  The meat was cooked to perfection and the sides were awesome.  I was very happy with my meal.  Listening to others at the table, they all like their filets and swordfish, but not one liked the pork and beans.  LOL as I told a few.  Eating a high priced fancy version of ham hocks and collard greens.

I am looking forward to the next time I am here so that I can stop by again and I highly suggest this restaurant for anyone in the area."}
{"text":"If you go you must have the Stetson Chopped Salad.   It is the best item on the menu.  I always try to stop by when I am in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Wow.  What a cool concept.  I got the exotic mushroom pan fry....mushrooms in an ancho cream sauce over polenta topped with grilled baby portables, avocado, tomato and cotija cheese.  Super umami in the tastebuds. 

Best thing I ever ate in an"}
{"text":"Service so friendly and genuine. Stetson salad is just insane. I moved from California 6 months ago and have been hitting Scottsdale restaurants like CRAZY!  Why I hadn't tried Cowboy Caio before, I have no idea. Maybe lack of street appeal?   Anyhow, I'm a fan. By far, my favorite restaurant in the land of restaurants!!!  Can't wait to come back and try other offerings."}
{"text":"Nice enough looking location.  Parking is plentiful.

Waiter was engaging but did disappear for long spells.

Food was good, not sure we had anything that was AMAZING.

Worth at least a revisit."}
{"text":"When I heard about Cowboy Ciao I was excited to try it. The food sounds so interesting and flavorful. 
We wanted to try as many dishes as possible, and they were such extremes. We started with the Calamari as we do every place we go. It was not great; the calamari itself was okay, nothing amazing, just okay. The sauce it came with was not good and the combination of the sauce and the calamari was downright gross.
Then we tried the Mushroom dish, and it was really good. So flavorful and really rich. I wish I had bread so we could eat the sauce. Highly recommended.
The third dish was the Tiger Shrimp with grits (I think) The shrimp were good, but they used Pace Picante Sauce with the grits and it was disgusting! I wish I was kidding about the Pace, but honestly if I went into the kitchen I bet I would find a jar...
The fourth dish we tried was the Spare Ribs, and these were really good, I would recommend these as well.
The dessert, Peanut Butter and Chocolate Brownie, was not impressive and could have lived without.
The roller coaster that was our meal was not what I would have expected for the price we paid and I probably won't go back. This is why I gave it 2 stars.
Sorry guys, but maybe you should re-look at some of your dishes...and the prices as well. Is it because it is Scottsdale that they can charge whatever ridiculous price you want?"}
{"text":"Their short rib was tender and spice just right.  The mash potatoes had a sweetness, adding Brussels sprouts pain but simple work.  I also had the Mac and cheese flavor just dance in my mouth."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with the serving size for the amount spent.   I have a hard time spending $17 on a sandwich and then only get a small portion.  I thought we had street pricing in PHX."}
{"text":"Tried it. And it was pretty good but not outstanding.  This place has a nice creative mix of flavors and textures (which can be good OR bad depending on your expectations).  Overall it's a solid choice for dinner and unique spot for the out of town guests.  But I struggle to make it back, since there are many other _great_ dining establishments nearby."}
{"text":"The Stetson chopped salad here is just as good as people say it is! I got it with chicken to-go ($14.50) and it still, to date, is the only salad that I actually finished and enjoyed. This is now my go-to for food in PHX!"}
{"text":"OK, so that Stetson Salad is serious business. I didn't believe it but that salad was probably the best salad I've ever had. They have it for dine-in and for to-go. Since I was in a rush, I got the chicken to-go, but next time I'll get the salmon in dine-in. The Stetson Salad makes me excited for PHX!"}
{"text":"We do love the Stetson chop, it is so good!!!

Order out, same great food without the wine at triple the price. TRIPLE!!!"}
{"text":"Took some clients here for dinner last night and it did not disappoint.

Their Stetson Chopped Salad is SOOO good.  Really unique, really tasty.

I had the seared ahi tuna and it was also very good.  The service was outstanding, the location and ambiance were perfect."}
{"text":"I was invited to have lunch for my birthday by a friend.  I checked the menu on line and felt it was rather limited according to my tastes and expected little pleasure from our lunch.  Boy, was I wrong!  The environment was simple, pleasant and open.  Service was slow, with a long wait for our food.  I ordered the chicken fried trout ($15) which was tasty, well prepared, with a side of slaw and nothing else.  I asked for some bread and was told they could give me crostini, five little pieces, the consistency and size of melba toast.  I also had half of my wife's order of open faced steak sandwich ($16) with blue cheese potato chips.  Nice slices of beef fillet, very tasty, as were the chips, an enjoyable combination.  The iced tea was very average.  Certainly more than a three star meal but short of five.  My friend ordered the house chopped salad with the addition of avocado and loved it.  Although the food was good I felt it was a bit overpriced, with limited choices so I probably won't return.  A slice of Birthday cake without the candle depicted in their photos and white with strawberry icing instead of what I expected from the photos of chocolate cake with white icing.  The three of us didn't finish the one piece, it was just OK, a bit heavy and on the dry side (no pastry chef involved here)."}
{"text":"Lifetime tops here.
Not fancy.
Service was so fast you'll freak (or think you are at Jimmy John's).
The Stetson salad a solid 6 out of 5 and the cereal killer dessert was literally the best thing my taste buds have had the pleasure of tasting!
I will be back!"}
{"text":"Got the chop salad everyone is raving about and although it was QUITE good, nice combination of ingredients, it was tiny and expensive. Maybe the to-go portion is smaller than what you would get in the restaurant but it shouldn't be because it was prices the same... $16 for a light salad is ludicrous."}
{"text":"Awesome service and amazing food!  The menu is a little limited but everything I have had is delicious."}
{"text":"I've eaten here three or four times over the past few years on trips to Arizona. One of my favorite restaurants, anywhere. Tonight I had a special that involved Frosted Flake-encrusted pork chops. It was amazing. Always eclectic, always an interesting crowd, great bartenders, cool cocktails."}
{"text":"I had the pork shank that was slow cooked and braised. With the small pan fried mushrooms and the famous stats on chopped salad. Yummy is the word used. Enough said! U just have to go to get the full experience."}
{"text":"Been here maybe three times and it's typically good.  I normally would give it 3 1/2 or 4 maybe.  This time only 3 though.  The espresso rubbed filet was average at best.  I've had this dish at other restaurants a couple of times and this was beyond overdone with espresso, plus overcooked.  The ahi was reasonably good but the quality of this piece of fish was subpar for Cowboy as there were tons of striations throughout the fish.  Something you see here and there but not to this degree.  The mushroom pan fry is always good so that was consistent once again.  The service was decent not great.  Couldn't get water or a glass of wine for quite a bit.  Great location, typically better than this, will go back in hopes that it will return to it's previous quality standards."}
{"text":"Bartender was nice, food was delicious, my Bloody Mary was delicious, great place for a layover meal!"}
{"text":"The chopped salad is incredible, the service always fantastic, and the honeycomb homemade ice cream may be one of the best things I've ever put in my mouth.  Yum!

Everything my friends and I have tried at Cowboy Ciao has been exceptional."}
{"text":"Love love love Cowboy Ciao, but for an airport, this took way too long. If you have the time, the Stetson chopped salad is the best. Three stars because of the wait time."}
{"text":"Decided to go for Round 2 for a light dinner this time.  I found the food and service to be superior to our last experience.

The husband and I shared the mini mushroom pan fry, and I see why it is their signature dish.  It was so good that I will not be sharing next time.  We also had the dungeness crab stack.  This is pricey ($20) for a small plate, but it was fabulous.  We had the cuppa' red hot chocolate to finish.  It was a to-die-for dessert.  A chocolate pot de creme (custard) with chipotle crema and a chocolate chipotle cookie.  Spicy, rich, decadent, all good things.

Our server was excellent from start to finish.  This time I am confident we will return, just maybe not at lunch."}
{"text":"On a whim, I came in for a few extra bites after a Yelp event with some friends. I thought it'd be light, but I was wrong. Even their so called appetizers will have you full from the richness they entail! I'm surprised that on a Tuesday night, it'd be so crowded, but the place felt alive and fun.

The Scallops with Risotto came with 3 large heavily seasoned scallops on top of a mixed risotto. This was in the appetizer section, but it was a good lunch size portion I would say. 

The mac and cheese and crispy potato chips as part of the \"bread crumb\"ish topping. I'm a sucker for truffled mac and cheese, so this was the first victim to be obliterated. No prisoners here. I will be ordering this every single time I return.

The pulled pork appetizer was more than enough for us to split 3 ways. It came with hard boiled eggs and some vegetables covered in a sauce that looked like Ponzu sauce, but was not actually Ponzu sauce, but whatever it was. Absolutely delicious!

Lastly, being a meat-a-tarian, I rarely order salads, but the hype about the Stetson Salad has solid ground. I don't know what exactly makes it so special, but like the menu description said, I would (probably) make a picture of this chopped salad part of my screen saver, because it's heroic how good it is!

I also bought some of their gourmet popcorn on the way out the door. I couldn't turn down chocolate hazelnut pretzel popcorn or chocolate bacon popcorn. I mean, \"When do you ever come across these types of snacks?\" My only dislike was that my diet soda was $4. I was actually taken aback by that since I'm used to sodas being half that, but whatever, I'm one to talk. I did after all and  on a whim, buy two $8 mini bags of gourmet popcorn."}
{"text":"Is it sad to say I was actually excited to go to the airport early? I really was, and all because one of my favorite restaurants in Phoenix is at the airport. Yes, Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport actually is a gourmet mecca with places like Cowboy Ciao, Barrio Cafe, La Grande Orange, and Chelsea's Kitchen finding their home there (just to name a few). Now, other airports just don't compare!

This menu at the airport compared to the menu at the original location in Scottsdale has some variations. Due to the diverse types of people from across the country, or even outside of the country, that encounter this restaurant, the Stetson salad can come with shredded chicken instead of the traditional salmon for example. The \"equal parts\" of each salad ingredient idea has taken the culinary scene by storm. Its recipe was even featured in the prestigious Phoenix Magazine, known for its literary prowess in describing new restaurant hot spots. Being a meat-a-tarian, it's hard to admit that it is one of the... Oh well let me be honest. It IS my favorite salad!

I paired my stetson salad with a bourbon drink.. Well actually two of them and ordered the truffled macaroni and cheese (also a Cowboy Ciao staple) because it's nothing short of awesome! Sprinkle anything with truffles (or truffle oil, but truffles preferably), and your taste buds with explode with overwhelming flavor. 

Our waitress made a mistake and ordered us bruschetta instead of the truffled mac and cheese when putting the order in, so she gave the bruschetta appetizer to us out of the kindness of her heart and sincerely apologized. I'm glad she did because with all the other intriguing menu items, I probably would've ordered something a little more adventurous than bruschetta, but I'm so glad that she did, because we loved the bruschetta! The edges of the bread were crispy but the center was soft but strong enough to hold either the tomatoes and cheese or the mushrooms and cheese, depending on what bite you were holding at the time. So simple, but so good! Definitely worth a bite.. or several!

It kills me that some people will stop by this restaurant and just think it's an average airport bar-restaurant gig, when it's actually something amazing."}
{"text":"I travel thru phx sky harbor often and always stop for dinner at CC. This evening the place was about 50% full. I had my usual Salmon dinner.  Unfortunately, it took almost 25 minutes to arrive. This would have been okay, except my wife's dinner arrived cold. We alerted the waiter and he brought warned up waffles to go with her chicken and apologized. When you pay $20 a plate, the expectation is a high level of food quality and service. I was disappointed today.  Note: the server did his job well. Kitchen service was a fail."}
{"text":"The worst 500 dollar meal I have ever had. Went for a celebration and ended up with indigestion. There isn't enough salt to enhance the lack of flavor of our meal. Cowboy ciao, should be cowboy so long..."}
{"text":"So My BF and I are trying a few places in prep for his family's visit for his graduation. This means we are allowed to eat ridiculous amounts of food in the name of science. Cowboy Ciao was the first stop on this tour and they satisfied and impressed.

We had to get a reservation for pretty early in the evening, since we called on short notice, but our waitress was very nice and knowledgeable about the menu. We of course tried their Stetson Chopped salad, which was delicious. The pine nut trail mix is probably my favorite part. The boyfriend also got the soup of the day, but I didn't think was  too spectacular. 

For entrees he got short ribs and grits with gouda. I got the lamb with artichoke risotto. We also shared a mini version of their mushroom mix polenta dish. The mushroom dish was amazing, one of their signatures and for good reason, and I definitely preferred Jordan's ribs and Grits to my lamb, which seemed a little dry. The risotto was the better part of that dish, very well done and great flavor (creamy without being mushy). The boyfriend's grits were absolutely the best thing at the table. I would eat a whole plate of just those grits any day of the week.

We took a lot to go home (no way we were going to eat all of that in one sitting!) and also got their peanut butter brownie desert and bread pudding to go. They make their own ice cream, and were able to package everything separately so there was no risk of melty, running dessert on the drive home. I got the peanut butter brownie and it was super tasty - rich and sweet without being overpowering (the boyfriend disagreed). The bread pudding was good, but not amazing.

Overall, i really enjoyed the signature dishes, as one should, and the side dishes of our 2 entrees. I love the atmosphere and the variety of dishes, plus it's really quite moderately priced. I would definitely recommend Cowboy Ciao but I wouldn't say it's the greatest thing since sliced bread."}
{"text":"Great food. The salad is very different. Good customer service too. We are just visiting Scottsdale for business and someone referred this place to us."}
{"text":"Server was rude but the salad was spot on! I paid 18 dollars for a salad lol but I ate it on the plane and that couscous was just amazing! Will buy again next month when i come back to NYC."}
{"text":"Not what I expected... Food was good, not life changing, but tasty. We were there for brunch and decided to have cocktails... Well, we only had one cocktail, but that was because our server got pretty busy and we never really had a chance to order another. We both ate the breakfast enchiladas; I ordered mine with scrambled eggs instead of fried. The food actually came out before the drinks, which seemed to embarrass and annoy the server. 
The ambiance could use a lil updating as the place seemed it hadn't been changed in 20yrs. The tables are fairly crowded together as well. We actually had to turn our table to leave once we were done cuz another table was sat practically on top of us. 
Good food, odd place. I gave it 3 stars cuz 2 seems unfair, but I'm not sure this is somewhere I'd dine out again.  I'm not a steak eater so dinner is out, but brunch is a maybe and thats if we are out of other options."}
{"text":"The duck salad was spot on.  In the crab enchillada, the rich sauce over powered the flavor of the crab.  The food portions are surprisingly large.

And if size matters to you, the wine list is HUGE."}
{"text":"Overrated and overpriced.

Everything building up to the food here is superb: the atmosphere and decor, the vibe, the service, and the menu items. Everything on the menu is a unique creation of the restaurant, and the group I was with really enjoyed mixing up our selections so we could try a little bit of everything. We loved everything on the menu down to our designated driver's soda choice: Spicy Ginger Ale from South Carolina, the original Dr Pepper straight from Dublin, Texas, that sort of thing.

Then came the actual food. I wouldn't say it was terrible. It was just... not spectacular. And sure as hell not worth $22 or more per entree. For starters, every plate we got was lukewarm. But I can quickly get over such foolishness by the waiter to judge the cook's creation before it was allowed to sit on a counter for too long. And the cook's creation was not that great. I sampled their signature dish, the mushroom pan fry ($24), and it was probably the tastiest I had. The Louisiane Gratin ($12 for an appetizer portion) and Mediterranean Eggplant ($22) were ordinary. The pork-belly sliders were satisfactory. Everything here is basically satisfactory. My taste buds want way more than that for this price level, that's all. I have a feeling Cowboy Ciao gets away with this only because it's in the heart of downtown Scottsdale. 

As we walked out of this restaurant for our next destination the consensus sentiment was: What exactly did we just pay $55 per person for? 

(That's before tip)."}
{"text":"Cowboy Ciao vs. Citizens Public House....Food Fight! Fight! Fight!

Round 1: The atmospheres could not be more different.  Cowboy Ciao is full of random southwestern colorful decorations, chandeliers, and murals on the wall.  It seems to excite the crowd because it was loud. Boisterous laughter, plates and glasses clanging, and faster more succinct service.  Polar opposite of CPH.  I would say come here to have fun with friends or a date you don't want to pay much attention to.   It's depends on one's mood so it's a draw.


Round 2:  The Salads!!!  
They are the exact same!  Exactly.  The same.  Which made the comparison easy.  The Stetson's tomatoes were tastier but the smoked salmon was not as good.  CPH 1

Round 3: The main courses.  I had the Pork Barbacoa which is considered a small plate on the menu....not so small.   There was at least a half of a lb of slow cooked pork that was topped with a fruit (apricot maybe) chutney and almonds.  All of that was served on top of a \"sweet potato/almond patata\" or as I called it \"a yum yum pancake\".  It was good and hit all of the sweet, savory, salty tastes and textures needed to make a satisfying meal.  My husband was kind enough to share his Pastrami Style Smoked Short Ribs with me.  The ribs were tender and flavorful with a slight spicy bite to them. But the potatoes...the potatoes!!!  Possibly the best potatoes I have had.  Delicious!!  For dessert we had the Oh, Canada, Peanut Butter Bar.  This was pretty amazing.  It was like having a peanut butter cheesecake with ice cream.  Seriously close call that I am not gonna call..  

Round 4: The Service.  It really depends on the type of service you like.  Our server here scored high on all marks and I didn't walk away thinking there was anything he could have done better but I will have to give this round to CPH.  Details on that are for another review.

It is a close one but the belt goes to the other guys on this one.  But that doesn't mean I won't be back the next time I am in town!"}
{"text":"5 stars for the Stetson chopped salad alone.  Enough said."}
{"text":"Fantastic spot.  Wife and I dined here back in April.  Tell them the type of wine you want, and they will pick a winner.  Food is fantastic.   Next time we are in town, we will be visiting again."}
{"text":"Nice staff.
Food and drinks over priced even for the airport. 
Very very limited menu.
Annoying music. 
And it doesn't take much to impress me....."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I had an amazing experience at cowboy ciao ! Walked up pretty late, 30 mins before closing but were seated promptly. We read up on the must try's before arriving and after looking at the menu decided to start with the Stetson salad and small portion of the mushroom pan fry. Our main course consisted of the tiger prawns and NY filet (yes we wanted to try everything). 

Stetson salad was great as reviews state. So many different flavors and textures. For my taste the couscous was a little overwhelming but the combination of salmon and tomatoes made up for it for the most part. My boyfriend loved it and he never eats salads haha.

Mushroom pan fry is a MUST HAVE. I love mushrooms and order them everywhere I go, these definitely did not disappoint. The fresh avocado over the top and the polenta on the bottom was perfect. 

Tiger prawns were also amazing! Super flavorful definitely added to  the southern twist this restaurant prides itself on! 

NY steak was a nice finish. My boyfriend says it's the best steak he has ever smelled haha he was overly excited to try it as soon as it hit the table. Meat was a little undercooked for my liking but he likes it that way so we kept it... It was topped with a morel mushroom/bourbon/cipollini onion sauce that was excellent. 

Our service started off slow as she was caught up with a larger party but was excellent throughout. She checked in on us regularly and fired the food perfectly. There was live music playing outside across the street and she didn't mind that my boyfriend and I wait outside for our food so we could dance and enjoy the live music. Overall, we had an amazing experience and each other's company was the icing on the cake :) we will be back and we will definitely recommend !!"}
{"text":"Not sure what's happening with the bankruptcy issues owner Peter Kasperski is going through, but...I have to admit-any restaurant with \"cowboy\" in the name sort of scares me. I'm not a fan of cowboy culture or what I'd traditionally associate with \"cowboy food\"-dead animals, goopy beans, etc. So when I went to Cowboy Ciao for a work dinner, I was a little apprehensive about the menu but was pleasantly surprised at how decent the meal was. Not to mention, the ambiance wasn't all Western-themed at all-it was modern and classy, with more European influence than anything.

We ate in the back room reserved for large parties, and our servers were friendly and attentive throughout the meal. To start, I had the Stetson chopped salad ($12), which normally comes with smoked salmon, pearl couscous, arugula, dried sweet corn, bruschetta tomatoes, trail mix and a pesto buttermilk dressing. I opted to leave the salmon off. The portion was tiny, but the remaining ingredients made for such a fun and interesting combination of tastes and textures. I loved the crunchy corn, which went really well with the dressing. I opted to mix everything together, even though the ingredients were originally separated, and the only complaint I have is that I wish there had been more of it.

For my main course, I had the Exotic Mushroom Pan Fry ($24), which came with polenta, mushrooms, tomatoes, avocado and cheese, drenched in a delicious ancho chile cream. I thought the mushrooms were amazing, but I'm not a huge fan of polenta, which I passed on to my dining companions. They said it was wonderful, so if you like polenta, you'll probably like this. My favorite part was the ancho chile cream, which had just the right amount of spice to it and complemented the other ingredients well.

I paired my meal with a tasty mojito, but someone else ordered a bacon-garnished cocktail that I had to take a picture of. Seriously, why is bacon such a big trend?! Poor pigs.

Other people noshed on Stuffed Pork Rib Chops ($27) with blue cheese, ancho bread pudding and raisin/fig compote, while others dug in to Grilled Salmon ($29), with poblano cakes and tomatillo relish. The dishes looked pretty, and I didn't hear any complaints about the rest of the food.

Dessert was so delicious, I would go to Cowboy Ciao just for after-dinner drinks and dessert. We had Ricotta Cheesecake ($8), with a strawberry/orange blossom compote and honey. Every bite was creamy and fruity and melted in your mouth-just how cheesecake should be. Mmmmmm.

So, don't judge Cowboy Ciao on its name. The menu includes everything from a New Zealand Lamb Loin to bruschetta and enchiladas-not exactly stuff you'd expect to see cooking around a campfire. And with candlelit tables and chandeliers gracing the ceilings, the eatery is way prettier than a dusty old saloon, too."}
{"text":"We were a party of 4 and I was being treated to dinner. NICE! (channeling Borat there). We ordered 2 Stetson Salads as appetizers and split them. I had the waiter leave the dressing off of mine. It was still delicious. I ordered the flat iron steak. I'm on a 90-day challenge so had them leave out the rice, and put the sauce on the side. Same thing: it was still delicious. At this point the waiter was eyeballing me like \"Oh, she's one of THOSE.\" So I then told him I'm trying to win this contest and money and hopefully that makes me seem a bit less bitchy and high maintenance in your eyes. (Table laughter) He smiled and said \"Yes, this changes everything. You get only water to drink!\" Haha. I had iced tea, no wine which was sad. The wine menu looked like something I'd have explored in depth had I not been on this challenge. 

Anywho. Everyone enjoyed their meal. Chicken, fish, beef, all yummy. The desserts sounded absolutely amazing as well. Like, omg, my mouth is watering so much right now amazing. Chocolate Budino, Strawberry Cookies & Cream, White Chocolate Croissant Bread Pudding, Oh Canada Peanut Butter Bar...ooooh la la! But I abstained, as did we all...the salad and meals were plenty to fill us up. Also, GREAT AMBIANCE! Funky quirky cool all around, and loved the dark purple candles. A+ Cowboy Ciao!

Excellent location in Old Town Scottsdale, always a great time!"}
{"text":"This place is great and it's in an airport! Really great. Nice music, great food, amazing beer and very nice staff."}
{"text":"The Stetson salad was excellent. The service was prompt and friendly. I had the raw salmon on my Stetson and it had a delicious smoked flavor. It wasn't enough to fill a man up and the price for airport food is high so it only gets 4 stars."}
{"text":"My friend took me for a birthday lunch.  John our waiter was very helpful and had perfect timing.  We shared the Stetson Chopped Salad and Fillet on Toast with leeks and homemade potato chips with blue cheese.  The kitchen plate/split our fillet, always a plus.  The salad with salmon, chicken is offered, was tossed tableside.  CC always has it's own twist on offerings.   The bread pudding and banana icecream were decadent.  
 Wish I lived closer."}
{"text":"So I've been hearing this place was soo good by multiple people and decided to go in and see what the fuss was about well, I never found out. From the second I walked in I was approached by a rude girl that made me feel like I was inconveniencing her by wanting to eat in the damn place. Then once I was seated the waiter started by taking our drink orders and said two of the selected drinks we wanted they had run out of...it was barely the beginning of the night!!! I then ordered a filet mignon thinking to myself, you have to really have your head up your ass to mess that up, guess what? They did. First of all, the presentation was horrible.There was way too much food piled up on the plate. It looked like a pile of left overs. All I have to say is you don't always have to add so much, sometimes simple is beautiful."}
{"text":"Being a person who works in the service industry, I am usually pretty understanding and nice about these kinds of things, but this had to be shared. I often joke with coworkers about our \"worst service and dining experience ever\" and today I have a new number 1. After waiting in line for ~10-15min, we were seated by a host and given a couple menus (this was the highlight of our stay by the way). It took roughly 8 min after that to be greeted by our server Jimmy, who was only able to muster the phrase \"what you guys want?\" after approaching our table. Don't you feel the hospitality? I had a coffee, my brother had a sprite, and his wife has a coke. Pretty simple stuff. Jimmy also took our food order at the same time (since we had ample time to look at the menu before we were greeted). Both my brother and I ordered the chicken and waffle sandwich and his wife ordered the breakfast enchiladas. Jimmy strolled to his POS and put our order in. Our drinks took roughly 15 min to get to us. My brother was given a coke, attempted to catch Jimmy's attention, but he was gone in a flash. The quickest I saw Jimmy move was when he was leaving the table. We even shared a laugh about how the food might come out before the drinks, but alas, everything in this restaurant moves slowly. When our food was delivered, I wasn't happy (but surely not shocked by this point in my stay) with the portion sizes. The waffles are only half of a waffle maker worth. Not to mention they were cold and rock hard. The chicken was very dry, fairly tough, and about 4oz in size. Two pieces. Most definitely don't order this if my review hasn't swayed you away and you are naive enough to even consider going here. My sister in law said that her food was great and just the right size for her (I'm being fair here). I never got a warm up or refill on coffee, and only one soda was refilled after everyone's plates had already been cleared. As we waited for the check, I watched the table next to us get delivered the food from another table, lots of empty drinks, and very few if any smiling faces. Heed my advice and never, for any reason, come to this place if you are in the Phoenix airport. And to anyone who gave a 5 star review, let me get a little bit of whatever you are smokin'."}
{"text":"Nice place with excellent wine selection. The dim lighting made dinner cozy. I had a wine flight and this salad which hit the spot!"}
{"text":"I looooved the chopped salad- one of the best salads of my life. We had a tomato basil soup and side of chips. All were good :) this may be my new go to restaurant at the PHX airport :)"}
{"text":"Went here recently when I was visiting my parents in AZ. 

This place is for wine lovers and foodies. If you're not one of those, I feel like you'll be a bit intimidated by both menus. If you are one of those, you'll probably love this place. 

Their wine list has 1,000s of bottles on it. My parents and I know what we like, but when the wine recommendations didn't really ring a bell (brands we've never encountered), it became a daunting task to select a bottle. Their beer list was solid though, so maybe we should have just stuck with that, or one of their famous (?) mixed cocktails. 

Most of our food was delicious. My entree (lamb) was super chewy and almost raw (I know I ordered it medium rare, that was probably my fault). Had it re-fired and it was a bit better (lesson learned). I loved the sides that came with it (which is why I didn't switch dishes), but you shouldn't love a dish because the risotto was so good. :-)

All being said, our server was super nice, very accommodating. She saved the meal for me. 

Given all the great food options that are popping up in downtown Scottsdale, you have to choose carefully. Look at the menu before you go and see if this place is right for you. Will most likely return, just with different expectations."}
{"text":"We went here for restaurant week. The food was tasty and the drinks were interesting and decent. The portions were super small since it was restaurant week just not sure that it was worth the cost $$$ even with it being $33 for a 3 course."}
{"text":"Overall, the food was quite good. A little slow, but pretty yummy. The service definitely left something to want for. Our server appeared as though she did not care. When we said we'd never been in before, she asked if we were tourists. Nope. Not tourists. She was very distant and absent the whole meal. Ordered my meal without avocado and it came with avocado. When I pointed this out, she seemed upset with me. Ordered my coffee with cream only, brought me sugar. It was the little things and the neglect but we will definitely think twice before returning for dinner again."}
{"text":"Please take the one star reviews with a grain of salt, it looks like they were written by people who have  DTS (Diva Travelers Syndrome). This place is an oasis in a vast landscape of meh. 

My experience with the food and the service was exceptional. I had a salad that was delicious and well thought out, definitely the best meal/experience at an airport (and I practically live in airports). Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Great place to grab dinner and a drink before your flight. The Cobb salad is amazing! Service is great and prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"Pricey but in line with airport pricing. Great food. I second the chopped salad and Kobe beef recommendations. Was not disappointed. 3 local beers on tap and they're good!"}
{"text":"Was excited to check out menu and get an appetizer to go. Decided to sit at bar to have drink while waiting. Male bartender gave me the stink eye... Male bartender waited on every guy there first then looked at me barely and goes do you need something? I didnt want to detract from his attention to all the dudes there...so I left and decided to come back some other time and maybe just order from the hostess. I went across the way to Tutto Cucina and they were so much more gracious and had good wine too. Ill prob go back to try it but not for a really long time...there's just too many other great places in Old Town."}
{"text":"This was another location for one of my engineering management dinners and what a great time we had. For some reason everyone thought this was a chili dive and during the bus ride, I heard more wining than a day care. 

Once we got there, the ohhhs and ahhhhs commenced. Cowboy Ciao has a fun exterior set in the midst of a buzzing part of Scottsdale. Inside is even better. 

The food was inventive and very, very tasty. The wine \"tour\" we were served was excellent and each was paired with a portion of the meal with perfection."}
{"text":"Although the menu looks very exciting, our appetizers were not as good as we expected. 
Mushroom dish had a lot of cremini and not as many wild mushrooms, otherwise a very rich and indulgent dish (can't imagine the entree portion). 
Duck relleno didn't have that much duck in it, otherwise the dish was very tasty. Buffalo carpaccio was good, but the toasts were way too crispy. 

Good drinks, somewhat slow service."}
{"text":"Love this place! Always have to stop by when I'm at this airport! The drinks are awesome and the food is very fresh/well portioned/and gourmet. A bit pricey but worth it!"}
{"text":"Best most original chopped salad I have ever had, I mean you made me like marinated tomatoes salmon and coccus plus something else crunchy - great service and ambiance. Ginger drink was good too just don't put the snap in the actual drink.  I will be back."}
{"text":"Chopped salad was delish but steak and lamb were both tough. Bruschetta was ok. Wouldn't order any of items again, other than the salad. Very noisy..hard to hear conversation at our table. Hostess and server were nice. Unlikely we'd return for dinner but might try lunch sometime."}
{"text":"Went for half-priced brunch this weekend and it was awesome! Totally plan to return and pay full price - they're already beyond reasonable! And, there's a delicious assortment of interesting and delicious breakfast cocktails - what more could a brunch-goer want!?!"}
{"text":"The service is absolutely excellent here (as well as food of course.)  thanks Mark and Rich and Nancy for always remembering what I like to drink and offering desserts you think I'd love. I miss the Spumoni, though. Bring it back!!!"}
{"text":"Of course you are at the airport so keep that in mind.  The food is not good - I had their special Reuben sandwich - it was dry the meat wasn't tender and very small portion for $16. Over priced even for the airport - save your money and eat at McDonald."}
{"text":"Apparently this restaurant has received awesome reviews (for an airport restaurant), and they make that known on the menu cover. I was really excited to try the chopped salad with avocado and steak, per one of the reviewers on yelp, but the waitress said that wasn't an option. Fail. Since I was craving steak, I ordered the testosterone salad and the bruschetta duet. The salad was really rich, and I have mixed feelings on the drunken cherries. The steak was really nicely cooked, and the potato chips were a good crunch. If you love bleu cheese, definitely get this salad!

The bruschetta, however, was meh. It comes with 4 pieces generously topped with sauteed mushrooms and chopped tomatoes (separately). The bread was far too buttered, and the toppings were just okay. I could do better at home myself.

It is VERY loud sitting in the dining area because there's the gate intercom speakers right above, so don't even think about talking on the phone. The staff were nice, but everybody looked like they hadn't slept in days and had ultimate resting bitch face."}
{"text":"We had a mushroom pan fry and grilled salmon on arugula salad. It was very good even though the portion was small but what can you expect with the high rents for restaurant establishments at the airport? The service by TJ was  very friendly, he tries to make it fun for the travelers who may be tired or frustrated, which was very nice."}
{"text":"Meh--the menu has more alcohol choices than food. I ordered the open faced steak sandwich and it was less than thrilling, for $18. Service was ok, food came out quickly. I would have had a Quarter Pounder from McDonalds next door!"}
{"text":"You will not be disappointed.  

This place has fantastic food, cocktails and service!  

I got the mini mushroom fry, my husband got the chicken fried trout, both were outstanding.

I like trying new things, but I will certainly eat here again the next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Ate this so fast that I forgot to take a picture. I'd recommend the Stetson chopped salad and the Common salmon- both delicious and healthy. Staff seated us quickly and brought food out promptly which really wasn't necessary because we showed up at the airport 3.5 hours early for a 1 hour flight home. You know just to be on the \"safe side\"."}
{"text":"Cowboy Ciao is the one-of-a-kind place that makes discovering restaurants will traveling become super fun.

Hard to describe the cuisine when you can get anything from a Korean-inspired-short rib to wild mushroom ragout over polenta.  Or a chopped salad that includes arugula, dried corn and trail mix in a ranch dressing.  I know, this all sounds incredibly weird but it works.  Wild west regional meets international fusion?  I don't know what to label the food, but the food rocks.

The scene is buzzy and hip.  Lots of done-up Scottsdale types.  But still plenty of jeans being worn there...jeans done just so, but still jeans.  Really fun decor that helps diners be happy.

Totally fun and satisfying!"}
{"text":"As always, sat at the bar and had their chopped salad and a martini- usually gin but this time made with Square One Cucumber vodka, Hendrick's gin, and a splash of lillet. Excellent end to a good week."}
{"text":"I lived in the Phoenix area for 16 years but left three years ago.  One of my favourite restaurants was Cowboy Ciao and my favourite dish there was the Short Ribs.  However, I noticed that they have changed the recipe for the Short Ribs and it now some pastrami concoction.  I do hope it is good as the last incarnation of Short Ribs they had as it was, hands down, the very best ribs I have ever had.  And that's saying a lot because they ribs are beef ribs and it is not as easy to make beef ribs as tasty as pork ribs, such as Baby Back Ribs."}
{"text":"Great brunch.  Spicy Bloody Mary's.  When I want to have something spicy and just a little different I head to Cowboy Ciao's for brunch.  One complaint is that you have to pay extra for the slipper bread.  It is so delicious, it'd be a nice touch if they put it on the table.  The Stetson Chopped Salad is a famous dish, as is the mushroom and polenta.  It is a little \"Scottsdale\" but the food makes up for it.  Now that the bridge is open, it would be nice to head out there and then a quick stroll on the bridge.  Oh, the mac and cheese is also delicious!  The drinks are good (especially since it is also owned by Kasimeriz) but the desserts are bit weak."}
{"text":"if you're into heavy, rich food, Cowboy Ciao is your place.  i wasn't thoroughly impressed with the food, but the service is good.  very welcoming hostess, if i do say so myself.

honestly, i'd rather walk around the corner to fnb - it's way better."}
{"text":"First the hostess ignored me because she thought my parents were more important than I was even though the reservation was under my name. She eventually figured out that we were all in the same party after ignoring my check in when my mother politely told her we were all together. She also was unaccommodating when asked if there was a trash can near by. My mother ended up having to visit the restroom trash can before we were seated. 
When we ordered salads and asked for one more fork (a fork fell under the table) our server rolled his eyes at us (Lou). 
I asked for the simple mixed green salad (first on the menu) and was met with a rude attitude from the server about dressing. He seemed annoyed when he asked what dressing I would like for it and I responded with the pesto buttermilk (which was the standard dressing according to the menu). 
The entrees we ordered did not say on the menu if had any spicy ingredients but five of the six orders were too hot too eat. 
The Syrah blend we drank was just gross. Do not order it unless you'd like a flavor of immature wine mixed with kool aid. 
When the servers came to clear plates, we asked for boxes to take leftovers and were met with our server's now-signature eye roll. 
We tried to be appreciative and polite throughout the whole meal but everyone was uncomfortable because of the way menus were thrown at us and the obvious inconvenience we caused to the servers from asking for the food items and when we wanted the boxes for leftovers after. 
When one person was sipping their wine, he was informed that no more would be poured to him \"if he kept swirling his glass\" even though he'd had about one half of a glass of wine. While he was not looking for more to drink and an unsolicited threat, this is a good example of the condescending attitude that seemed to permeate every interaction with the staff. 
Ultimately the win was the alberino (white wine) and the brussel sprouts from the duck appetizer even though every piece of duck was more than fat than duck. 
I would suggest eating somewhere else.
This restaurant was a disappointment and I won't be back."}
{"text":"The three star is only for the salad. It was delicious, but over priced. 

I was here several years ago and I remembered it to be very good. I made a mental note to come back, but this time around it very disappointing. Horrible service. It wasn't even a weekend. First they forgot my appetizer, then it took about an hour for them to bring our main dishes out. We ended up canceling our order because we had to leave for a meeting and was just really bothered by the service. They had one waitress and we couldn't ask about our dish  until she made her rounds to all the table. 

Come here for the food, but don't expect great service all the time."}
{"text":"WOW!  What a fantastic little place!  It is a bit Cowboy Hipster but if you've been to Austin Texas, then you can appreciate this spot.  Service, food, ambiance are all spot on!  They make a heck-uv-a great drink too!  Cool your spurs and stay a while!"}
{"text":"not for picky eaters! im one, ill admit.

everybody seems to love this place but i cant figure out why. we went with another couple who raved about it. i wasnt impressed with the menu -- it was certainly interesting and different, but nothing amazing.

it was okay, but i probably wont go back unless a group is going and i dont have a choice. i dont what all the fuss is about."}
{"text":"Round 2 - Restaurant Week again!

This time around I was quite disappointed.  My group ordered pretty much everything on the Restaurant Week menu.  I went with the Seared Ahi Tuna, Short Ribs, and Peanut Butter Bar.  Overall, everything was well cooked, however over....over salty!  The texture was just fine, but in the end too much salt.  I usually drink a lot of water when I eat, but tonight they should have left the pitcher.  My group in general drank a lot of water!  I would talk more about the food, in the end all I can remember was --- dang that was salty!  Sorry gang I don't know if I can go another round for this place. Ding, ding, ding -- Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Wow, not bad for airport food! We had a connection at Sky Harbor, and it was 1 Eastern so I grabbed something to eat across from our gate. The line was fairly short, but it took forever. I don't know if that's because an order was complex or it was just slow, but it was bad.

I got a west coast wrap with chips, and it was pretty pricey. The wrap was excellent though. It tasted very fresh and had plenty of stuff inside it. The chips were exceptional--probably some of the best chips I have ever had.

What can I say? Good airport food! All right! Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Three stars for the food, it was actually really great and I would have loved to try a few other items if I was more hungry. Two stars off for it to take over 30 minutes to get a salad at an airport where everyone is in a hurry and for the atrocious service. My server was downright rude and couldn't have been less interested in serving my table."}
{"text":"One of the best meals I've had...high west rye and delicious food.  Every dish was awesome."}
{"text":"Amazing salads! I had the Stetson Cobb salad... I picked avocado as my protein but the salmon looked awesome too

Has take out as well as seating and an extensive bar

The only bummer is my salad cost $14 and change, which seems a lot for the amount u get. But it is an airport location after all."}
{"text":"As foodies, we were overcome with the menu!  The place is not that cool, but the menu is wonderful with abundant choices of food that was both creative and very, very, well done.  Service was enthusiastic and well done.  If you want to suffer because you can't pick from wonderful choices, perfectly prepared, then this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Stetson Chop Salad has become a staple since moving into the area. Service has always been responsive as well."}
{"text":"Place had a nice dark atmosphere with candlelight. I ordered a short rib over potatoes and brussel sprouts. For the almost $40 dish, I thought it was a little underwhelming. I expected the meat to be awesome but it was ok. There was some fatty parts and some flavor which made it delicious, but other parts were just plain. I found myself scraping the plate for the sauce cuz there was just no taste in the meat. The potatoes were delicious and so were the brussel sprouts. Kinda weird when the sides taste better than the main meat piece. I've eaten less expensive plates with more flavor. The food looked nice but didn't match the visual hype.

The garlic bread was amazing though."}
{"text":"The food was excellent, the chopped salad, which really isn't a salad, is a delicious starter and easily serves two. I also had the burger which was amazing. Don't ruin it with ketchup or mustard allow the special sauce they use to enhance your meal. You do need to ask for lettuce, tomato, and onions on the side however. That is if you don't want just bread and meet. My only criticism is that it is very loud, and a little on the pricey side for what you get."}
{"text":"This is good. They had four stars until my food came way late. Boo 
Other then that Very impressed with the food.  Slightly expensive but you know its the airport. 
I love the new wave of bringing in local flavors into the local airports."}
{"text":"Cowboy Ciao is hard to rate. So ego driven. Some great courses. (Try the mushrooms). Don't go there if you care about wine. The wine list is incomprehensible. 40 pages listed by price. Everything lumped together only sorted by price. Really? They don't even sort by format. God help you if you want a half bottle. They are mixed in with the full bottles. You have to go line by line for 40 pages looking for the half bottles. Finally I asked if their half bottles are stored together. The answer was yes. I then asked if I could just go and look at them to save time. Answer? No, they don't allow anyone to see their cellar. Restaurants who get it are proud to give a tour of their cellar....."}
{"text":"Our waiter, Ian,  was terrific - one star. The food was amazing - two stars.  The place was so noisy we could not talk to each other at a small table for two.  We told them it was our anniversary when we made the reservation, but that meant nothing to them, so we left before dessert and coffee.  It is a shame, as the food was outstanding, but the ambience was terrible."}
{"text":"Our first time here!  Been wanting to come here for years!!  Celebrating my birthday today.   Cool looking place and a pretty big bar also.  We came for AZ Restaurant week.  After all the hubbub about their chopped salad, i do have to say that it was very good and unique that has some sort of crunch to it that made it very interesting.  We both had the shrimp and avocado appetizer.   That was really a \"meh\" starter...no real umph to the shrimp in terms of flavor and the avocado just added a creamy texture to the dish but no real zing.  Then the main course consisted of a beef filet with a bleu cheese butter topper...fantastic!  It had asparagus and yukon mashed taters.  The potatoes were grand!  I had the pork mole ravioli which had an outstanding flavor and nice spicy kick that threw me off initially but really appreciate how it complimented the dish.  And then there is the pastrami style short ribs...OMG!  It tasted like an old school pastrami dish that i used to get at Katz's deli in NYC...(for those who don't know, that was a compliment).  Finished off with a chocolate panna cota which also came around to the slight above the meh level again.  Oh!  Last thing, there is this superb martini that has raspberry infused vodka (its called \"ciao\" something...give that a try!l. We will go again to sample some other dishes and let you know about it."}
{"text":"I'm really leaniing more toward 3 1/2 stars. I ordered the (corn)nut crusted scallops and the bruschetta. The scallops were small (only 3 to an order this is definitely an appetizer not a meal) and the bruschetta large. I saw a lot of people ordering the salad. They said the dressing was really good. But the amount also looked rather puny. Better to order from the togo menu or try your luck somewhere else. 4 stars because it did taste good and it was clean and fast service. But the food was more like a 3 1/2."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try Cowboy Ciao for a while now and finally happened to be in the area with my husband a couple weeks ago and decided to try. I am apparently in the minority here, but it was a major disappointment from a food standpoint. 

We started with bruscetta which had way too much vinegar to the point where you could barely tell you were eating tomatoes. It was doused with so much oil and vinegar that the bread underneath was soggy within a couple of minutes of sitting there. 

I had the espresso rubbed filet Mignon and asked for the \"sauce\" which the waitress said had allot of heat to it to be on the side so I could control the heat. Now, I appreciate some heat in my food and am no wimp but even without the sauce with the heat in it - this fillet had so much heat that I had to take a sip of water after each bite and could barely taste the fillet. It was awful. And the potatoes were slightly undercooked and not hot. 

My husband had the short ribs which he said were OK but not outstanding or even memorable. We chose to skip desert. The presentation of the food was gorgeous, the place itself was cute and our waitress did a good job. It's possible we both just ordered the wrong thing for our tastes - but I'm not inspired to want to drop another $110 based on our experience. Arrowhead Grill in Glendale blows this away for this price point."}
{"text":"Stetson Chopped salad. Go for no other reason but for this yummy salad. The rest of their dishes are pretty good too but hands down the salad is the best. Try it, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"The Stetson Salad was delicious and I'm not big on salads. The Mushroom Pan Fry was unique and very good as well."}
{"text":"Two words: Chopped salad. Mmmm. I crave it on a daily basis."}
{"text":"Disgusting filet mignon was blue! Not even cooked. So gross. Who's cooking back there? 2 year olds???"}
{"text":"I hate airport restaurants. You're trapped. You don't have much choice. The staff are generally unhappy and mildly interesting. This place was sooooo different!

We started with drinks. The choice and selection is amazing. They can pretty much make any drink. 

The food - unbelievable. Started with the infamous Stetson salad. It's incredible. I've never had anything like it!

Short ribs and fillet minion were incredible. 

The best part - Terry - out waitress. She is awesome. She was so caring and diligent - unseen in most restaurants - much less an airport one!

I would consider coming to the airport just for a meal here - forget about flying!"}
{"text":"Wow. Just went to Cowboy Ciao for the first time. So many great choices on the menu. Hard to pick. We got a few and they were all amazing. Can't wait to go back and work our way through the entire menu. Super. And the staff was great. Quick to help and very friend. It was a busy night and the staff was always there to help."}
{"text":"Cool! So great to discover eats in an airport that makes you feel good. Cowboy Ciao did just that! The unforntunate part is that I arrived just before 8am and was still not hungry from the night before. I just wanted to relax for a couple hours and have a coffee in a real cup, nut paper or styro. Finally I chose to mozey in. Nice little table for two. Waitress, Jennifer, greeted me and brought my coffee. She was such sweetheart! I later decided to have either and mimosa or Bloody Girl and Jennifer assisted so authentically with that, asking if I liked spicy. Yes! I only wish it were 3hr later. But I did see several breakfast dishes and they were perfect. Breakfast potatoes looked just how I prefer! Oooooo I wish I could be hungry!! Exotic Mushroom Pan Fry would be my first choice. I just hope I can go through Phoenix on my next flight! And best of luck to Jennifer!"}
{"text":"Just are here and the food was great and very filling. I had the chicken and waffle \"sandwich\", which is a piece of fried chicken and half a red velvet waffle. I'm not a coleslaw kinda girl so I opted for the homemade chips on the side. I finished with the Oh Canada Peanut Butter Bat, which was delish.

Service was great! They were super helpful and came by at just the right time."}
{"text":"My friend and I stopped here when we were flying to Hawaii for a few drinks. We tried the Bloody Mary Jane and mimosas. Their mimosas are made with prosecco which I love and am so happy about. The Bloody Mary Jane was made with vodka and mescal which gave it a smoky flavor. I think too much fresh basil was used but I'm the least biggest fan of basil so take that as it's worth. We also ordered chips with a side of pesto dipping sauce. The sauce and chips were good. Prices are airport prices so be prepared for that. I would stop here again if I were in the phx airport for some drinks and quick snacks. Oh, a mimosa is $13... Maybe I won't be back..."}
{"text":"I'm not one for hyperbole, but this may have been

THE  BEST      MEAL      OF   MY       LIFE!!!!

I'd like to hold an awards show and give out lifetime achievement trophies to the following individuals:

1.  To the chef, who exceeded my expectations again and again. The Stetson salad, wild boar meatballs, and Korean-style BBQ short ribs (and that killer side of au-gratin brussel sprouts) and you, sir, have won my heart and my stomach.  I want to fill a swimming pool with that BBQ sauce!

2.  To our server, Richard.  Your genuine excitement for the food was a nice change from past servers reluctant to give a real recommendation.  You were cordial and professional and made sure we enjoyed our time with you.  I don't know, I may name my unborn child after you in tribute.

3.  To the pastry chef, Country.  Your bread pudding was exceptional, but what a surprise, your ice creams were downright dreamy!  The scoop of brown butter ice cream took my tastebuds on a field trip through chilled fields of chocolate truffles.

Thank you thank you for a wonderful birthday dinner!"}
{"text":"Is there a 4.5 star review? Service was the only question mark. I'm still trying to decide if our server was surly or just the ironically fun type of surly. 

The food is divine though. Started with the chopped salad that everyone raves about. My wife had been here before and swore by it. She didn't mention that the salad had salmon in it though. I not only hate salmon, I'm also allergic to it. However, we found out you can sub chicken and that's exactly what I did. Fantastic taste and the texture is what really caught me. It's nutty, meaty, and still a salad. Fantastic!

My entree was the pastrami seasoned beef rib. Just order it. It's like a big piece of pot roast or even like a real corned beef, but with the peppered seasoning on the outside. It falls apart like a great roast should. It's accompanied by Brussels sprouts and mashed potatoes. The Brussels sprouts and the corned beef nature of the meat make it a bit like an Irish corned beef and cabbage (but, I personally LOVE that). 

I will be back and I won't even need to look at the menu. Get the pastrami seasoned beef rib."}
{"text":"Nothing like the old town location. We've been eating at the old town location for years. The famous chopped salad is different with different dressing. Service was terrible. Greeted by rude host said I couldn't sit at table or booth. Strange won't return."}
{"text":"I don't consider myself a foodie, but if I did, I imagine this would be a regular on my rotation of local restaurants!  I actually have only eaten at Cowboy Ciao twice... once, a while back, for dinner, and then just the other day for lunch (with Sarah G).  

I have to agree with Sarah... the lunchtime service was nothing special.  Our waitress was not overly friendly and she didn't give us much attention either.  We had to ask about several menu items including a refresher on the ingredients in the \"Stetson Chopped Salad\" as the menu doesn't say...

Luckily, the company I was with made up for the 'eh' service.  The salad (I had the Stetson Chopped) was actually really unique and the perfect size for a light lunch.  

I remember the wine menu being pretty impressive as well as that Exotic Mushroom Special, so I'm sure I'll be back to visit Cowboy Ciao eventually.  I'm probably being generous with 4 stars, but maybe it's just because I am giving them the benefit of the doubt.  In any case, as Stephy S likes to say... 'Ciao for now!'"}
{"text":"I'm giving this place 4 stars because of the amazing service we just got. We were in Phoenix on a quick layover and time was scarce. The unbelievably helpful cashier went out of her way to tell us what we could have that would work for vegans. 

We got the Stetson Chopped Salad minus the meat and cheese and a vinaigrette instead of whatever normally comes with it. The woman who seemed to have a limp and probably some health problems (she mentioned she can't eat broccoli or tomatoes) was running the show, going out of her way for us and even walking back to the kitchen when she caught them putting cheese in our salads. She stopped that like a sheriff in charge of her county and while we worried about her getting around, we couldn't have been more grateful. (Give that woman a raise!) 

Our food was ready quickly and the manager even came out to see if we had been taken care of. Again, awesome customer service. 

The menu is limited for vegans but we made it work and the Stetson Chopped Salad was quite good. It has freeze-dried fresh corn (new to me) and we got avocado instead of chicken.  Really really good. It already comes with cous cous which makes it quite filling.  

The food was decent but if I could make that cashier my grandmother and take care of her forever I would. Be nice to her if you see her."}
{"text":"Lost in a maze of airport food, this was a fantastic gem! Lots of fresh ingredients in their varied and very appetizing options."}
{"text":"So....I've written very few reviews. However, when it comes to horrible customer service, you're more than welcome to count on it from the greeter named Collie. I may have misunderstood his name, but I was clear about his actions and mannerisms when I spoke with the manager Memo.

We approached the entrance and no one was in-line and he didn't even look up to say hello. When he did look up, he gave us a disgusting look! There were only two of us and the place was not full. The first table he brought us to, he threw the menus on the table and we asked if he would mind moving us to a more quiet area towards the back. He then rolled his eyes and didn't move. So, I took charge and requested to sit at a one of the open tables in the back. Once we arrived, he threw the menus on the table and walked away. I asked him nicely with his back turned was his manager available. He ignored me until I touched his shoulder. I let him know he was providing the worst customer service I had ever experienced, almost borderline racism as we're a mixed black and Asian couple.

We brought it to the attention of Memo, who immediately apologized and was accommodating. We made it clear we don't need anything. Our sole intent was to help him understand what took place and he said he would speak to him. 

We still ordered our food and left the customary 20% tip! 

We all have bad days, but this went well beyond the treatment anyone should experience. Love the atmosphere and the food!"}
{"text":"Came here a few months ago and ordered an open face sandwich and steak salad. For airport food it's actually good. Today we had ordered the chop salad as well as the tomato cream soup. The soup was very tasty as well as creamy. The salad, which was good however was meant apparently for a child. The salad, which is very pretty don't get me wrong is striped with tomatoes, sweet corn, tasted like corn pops as well as chicken. There is also trail mix thrown into the salad. The avocado ranch tastes homemade, but the portion size is ridiculously small!!

I would suggest giving a little more food to the customer considering your charging higher end restaurant fees for small portions in a airport! The host was really sweet too and had to throw how a drunk customer."}
{"text":"Had the pork chile burger thing as our waiter said it would be the best burger I ever had. Yup, insanely good! Everything we ate was awesome!"}
{"text":"First time here, it's restaurant week... 3 corse meal for $33 bomb ass food great price. Lovvvve the decor ESP the chandeliers, verrrry pretty!!!"}
{"text":"Great place for a drink. Fast service and they expedite. I didn't have food but will be back for sure next time at B gates in PDX.  They really a lot better than most airport bars in terms of speed and service."}
{"text":"I was visiting the area and many recommended this restaurant and the Chopped Salad. It was 5:00 on a Monday so it wasn't busy but I sat at the bar and ordered the Chopped Salad. It wasn't what I expected but I thought it was fantastic. The bartenders George & Liz were awesome. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"This place is wonderful!! Finding a yummy and relaxing and welcoming place in an airport is usually a fruitless exercise. But... If you are in the Phoenix airport for a long-ish layover, make your way over to Terminal 4, and the B concourse. Right by gate B22, you will find a place with delightful options, both in food and drink, and also delightful people. The staff is attentive, courteous and engaging, without invading your space. My husband and I are both vegetarians, so options were limited, but the Burrata Insalata salad was unreal (see pic). Buffalo Mozzarella, arugula, grape tomatoes and a huge helping of avocado topped with a few fried shallots--as I said, UN REAL. Price-wise, for a sit-down slice of heaven in an airport, $11 is hard to beat for a delicious and filling salad. I also had a glass of wine (zin from chronic cellars) that was delicious and about $8. You will do yourself a favor if you head over there. It helped put a bad previous flight experience and a long layover out of my head. Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"I love the attitude of Cowboy Ciao.

COWBOY CIAO: HISTORY 

Cowboy Ciao opened in February, 1997, and it was well into 1998 before information operators stopped telling callers that they didn't exist because they tried \"Cowboy Chow\" instead of the proper name \"Cowboy Ciao.\" That irreverence, stubbornness and self-confidence that the stupidity lies in the other person, so let them figure it out if it's important enough, is right in my wheelhouse. It doesn't hurt that Cowboy Ciao also sits on a prime piece of Old Town real estate on Stetson Drive and has some of the best and most creative food currently available.

Cowboy Ciao began as a neighborhood joint with the wine-friendly fare focused on Italy, Mexico and the American Southwest and has since evolved into a \"Big City\" restaurant featuring a Modern American menu with Southwest accents and Global influences, sporting an internationally-acclaimed wine list hovering around 2000 selections.

THE STORY 

I've been several times and nothing about Cowboy Ciao ever gets old: Elegant chandeliers, rustic seating and an edgy bar with a great view of Old Town Scottsdale from almost everywhere.

The food is like none other and the drink selection is outstanding.

Some of the food choices I've enjoyed are the sticky short ribs, grilled salmon, hominy, the world famous exotic mushroom pan fry and the chocolate budino and bacon beignet. (see pics)

Some of my favorite drinks include the Argentine Malbec and Laurent Perriet Rosé. (see pics)

SERVICE EXPERIENCE 

The staff is hit or miss; usually hit, although I have had one less than stellar server, but nothing worth more than excusing the experience as a fluke. Usually, the staff is very attentive, but not intrusive and helpful with wine selections.

CONCLUSION 

5/5 RECOMMEND

{"text":"During a lengthy layover in Phoenix, we went for a late lunch at Cowboy Ciano.  I had the Stetson chopped salad and Truffle Mac and Cheese.  Both were delicious.  My wife shared my salad and had the scallops over risotto.  Her meal was also delicious.  Very interesting dining experience in of one of the strangest locations: the airport.  Service was very good."}
{"text":"Great, unique restaurant.
The staff was super friendly & helpful. 
Chopped salad was amazing, great wine & cocktail list!"}
{"text":"Haven't been here in a long time but recently went mid week and the service was amazing! Great drinks (I had the Viva!) and of course the chop salad is to die for. Four top and everyone licked their plates clean! Great old town establishment and a good option for out of town guests!"}
{"text":"Fun, loud atmosphere. Fun for groups or with your honey. The Stetson Chopped Salad is a must. You could share it but why not eat it all? The textures and blend of ingredients are perfection! Everything was delicious. We also tried the mushroom dish which was just as delicious. The mini appetizer size was plenty to share.  I need to try each dish at least once before I die. An absolute must-go place to dine in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"B-concourse ((gates 15-28?), good place to eat or grab a bevvie... And their steak sandwich is awesome! Two small super-tender (med-rare) filet mignons on a ciabatta slab, with onions and a sauce that's a great compliment! Top if off w/a bottle of Pinot Grigio that's reasonably priced, and you've got a winning combo!"}
{"text":"As a Londoner living in Scottsdale I got very excited reading all the different dishes on offer! I hadn't seen another menu like it and not everything was smothered in cheese! 
The food was yummy. The Mushroom dish excels in flavour. The scallops were succulent and cooked to perfection...the poem dish was so tender....I can not wait to return and try the peanut butter thingy!!!!!!!!! 
Good service ...good food...winning combination!"}
{"text":"I had a four hour lay-over in terminal 4 and wasn't quite sure how I was going to kill the time.  Saddled up at Cowboy Ciao for wine and lunch, and have to say, the Stetson salad was one of the best salads I have ever had (and I eat so much salad, I am practically a rabbit).  Naturally, the wine was properly chilled and delicious!  This was an absolutely perfect experience, as the service was phenomenal (her name was Elizabeth) and not once did I feel rushed or like they didn't want me lurking for too long.  I travel through this airport very often, and this will be a regular stop!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice, once at their main location and once at their airport location and I've been disappointed both times. The food is good but not great and the prices are high. In my opinion, not worth it."}
{"text":"Considering how well reviewed this restaurant is, you would think they would know how to properly cook a flour tortilla, and not turn eggs into unseasoned hunks of rubber. The staff were very polite and very attentive, but the sad attempt at \"Breakfast Enchiladas\" I received  for 15 bucks left me with a bad taste in my mouth, both figuratively and literally. Hoping my experience was just a fluke."}
{"text":"This place gets two stars because its slightly better than Matt's Big Breakfast in the airport, but still awful."}
{"text":"I can see why a person might like cowboy ciao, but I did not. Its definitely \"out of the box\" all the way. They have this moronically gigantic winelist that goes in order of price only--so if u want say, a Pinot, u have to look all throughout this ridiculously huge and not great list. Then they are out of the wine, and u have to wait for the \"master wine f**face\" to give u a recommendation. Very painful!! The service was atrocious--grossly disorganized, slow, unbelievable. The food was ok, somewhat overwrought, but definitely not worth the wait. While I liked a couple of the dishes, I'd definitely head to any of the other fine choices in the area and save yourself from the disorganized and inefficient service here."}
{"text":"Wait staff (T.J.) was awesome;  energetic,  a lot of pride in the brand and presentation and menu-smart.  I had the open-face steak sandwich. It's a 5-6oz filet mignon that was perfectly medium rare and very tender. I personally would have preferred fries over chips,  but didnt know that so didn't try to substitute anything. My daughter had the quesadilla of the day and said it was really good but that the chipotle mayo dressing was outstanding. Considering what you usually get at Phoenix's airport for food, this was a real treat."}
{"text":"After a long day in airports -- and a pretty bad meal at a place in Mexico -- it was refreshing to have a decent meal here at AZ's airport! We were really close to choosing McD's when an airport working suggested we try Cowboy Caio, and I'm so glad we did. 
We had the open-faced steak sandwich, which was well flavored and cooked just the way I like it (med rare) atop a nicely grilled and buttered piece of bread. It came with kettle chips drizzled in bleu cheese, but because I wasn't a huge fan of the cheese, the waiter suggested I dip them in this pesto aioli that was yum!
We also had a shared plate under the heading \"Grazing\" that turned out to be a huge dish. It was a green chile pappardelle concoction that sounded kinda weird at first but was surprisingly delicious. It kind of reminded me of tuna casserole... but in a good way if you can image that.
The wine, beer and Bloody Mary list was pretty impressive, though they seemed to be running low on the white wine selections when we came in.
All in all, I really enjoyed it and was happy to find it in the mess that can be airport food."}
{"text":"Was not impressed.  A few friends have said citizen public house is better all around, but we took our chances.  Service was good, food was average.  When your in Scottsdale and going to a great food place (especially at $75 a person) I guess I just simply expected a bit more.  Chop salad is great, warm bread was good, pork chop was a little dry, but the surprise was the bill.  $150 for 2, with only 2 drinks.  No dessert either.  Average, and prob wont be back."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! I got the burger no bun and it was amazing!!! I am so happy I stopped here on my way to my next flight!"}
{"text":"Awesome new spot in PHX;, which they have needed for a long long long time. 

I got the testosterone salad. Amazing. Blu cheese crumbles, rare steak, good greens. Beats normal airport food any damn day."}
{"text":"Walking thru ol'town I stumbled upon this place. Rustic, laid back and yes-- great eats. 

The Stetson salad.....absolutely fantastic. 

The mushroom entree was really great. 7 types of mushrooms. 

I couldn't figure out the wine list, but who cares once you try the Stetson salad your all set.

If I return to Scottsdale, this place is on my list!"}
{"text":"There are two places that reside at the top of my list as must-go recommendations in the Phoenix area, and it's Cowboy Ciao and Pizzeria Bianco, but not necessarily in that order.  I'd give the Ciao 4 1/2 stars if I could, but since that's not an option and I love this place, it's getting the full 5 from me.

Why?

Well, to start, the magic words are \"Exotic Mushroom Pan Fry\".  On the menu, it's stated a guest described it as being so good, they wanted to take their clothes off and roll in it.  Personally, I feel that would be rushing things.  This is a dish you need to take out to its own dinner first.  Share a bottle of wine with it.  Ask it about its dreams and its favorite books and shows.  Meet its parents, ask them permission to take things to the next level, and when the time is right, then you can get naked and commence aforementioned slather rolling.

Of course this only goes for mushroom lovers.  For those anti-mushroom-ites out there, I don't understand you, but turn your heads for a sec and hum the theme to Mario Bros while I whisper the ingredients to those with an affinity for Earth's favorite fungal treat:

(Cremini, button, oyster, cepe, lobster, black trumpet, shiitake, morel, and yellow foot mushrooms in ancho cream over double-cooked polenta, topped with grilled portabellini, avocado, tomato and cotija cheese)

I know, right?  And yes it tastes as good as it sounds.  

For the mushroom challenged, you can look back now.  Another dish I highly recommend is their \"Stuffed Pork Rib Chop\" which is gorged with Shropshire blue cheese then grill-seared and oven-finished and served with ancho bread pudding, apple jus, raisin/fig compote and pan-grilled vegetables.  Holy hell this is good.  This is the kind of dish you cheat on the Mushroom dish with, let's call it your Meat Mistress.  This dish says to hell with rolling around naked, and suggests going straight to a threesome.  Any of the dishes on the menu will fit the bill for this taste romp, as would the many creative drinks they have to offer.  Just do what it says and remember to set your safe word.

For dessert, skip the bacon cookies.  It's interesting and all, but really not worth it.  Instead go with the blue cheese cheesecake or the bread pudding.

I've been here half a dozen times and loved it each time.  There are still many more dishes I'd love to try, including the hearty salads I never got around to.  I just hope their Testosterone Salad is named for being manly in its steak and bourbon soaked roots, and not due to containing millions of little swimming chromosomes.  Forget I said that... 

Oh hey try not to get lost in the wine list!  It's a labyrinth best left to the Goblin King.  But even 1986 David Bowie might not find his way out of this one.  Don't say I didn't warn you.  Just go with one of the dozen or so wine flights available unless you know exactly what you want.  The wine list has no real power over you as long as you don't show visible fear.  It can smell fear."}
{"text":"Super service and great food. VERY unexpected for an airport restaurant. 

I accidentally left my wallet and one of the starters was running all over the airport trying to find me. Who does things like that anymore!?"}
{"text":"Cowboy Ciao is great. The drinks are great, the food is delicious! We loved the scallops and chopped salad! Blueberry donuts for dessert!? What? Yes please. Tito the bartender was awesome, sit at the bar it's quieter and more pleasant hanging out with Tito! The one draw back and reason for a 4 star rating issss the hostess Olivia.She has an attitude. She tried to seat us at a two top in the sun surrounded by noisy tables. I asked to sit elsewhere and she looked at me like I was from another planet. She said they wouldn't have another server for 20 min. Didn't ask if we wanted to wait. We opted to sit at the bar and watched her seat other couples in the quieter room. She never checked back to see if we wanted to move. I give her a thumbs down but the restaurant a big thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Delicious place, so glad I got to come here!  Everything was flavored fantastically, I was really impressed.

Their Chopped Salad was really good (as everyone says) with bits of salmon, corn, lettuce, tomatoes...it was crunchy, chewy, soft all at the same time.  Their Chicken Fried Trout was really good, somehow, it tasted completely non-fishy and was fried perfectly.  Their Exotic Mushroom Pan Fry was really good, with different types of mushroom in sauce over polenta.  Their Nuts About Scallops was really good too, crispy fried scallops served with a really good risotto.  Every dish we had was a perfect complement to the other (we shared everything!).

I would get every dish we had here again, twice, three times.  I want to go back!"}
{"text":"What a great and interesting meal!

In town for business and looking at CC's menu, I was intrigued when I saw Wild Boar  Meatballs.   Starting with drinks, they have an amazing mixologist behind the bar.  I went for a drink called Viva based on the waitress' recommendation.    This was a very refreshing, strawberry based drink with different herbs and fresh ingredients.  They also have an incredible wine list ranging from an inexpensive bottle up to $1500 + bottle of vintage.

We decided on the small plates menu as it was late and also there were a great deal of interesting items in this area.  The thing that impresses me so about this restaurant is the interesting combinations the Chef brings together.

To start. the Stetson Chopped Salad is an absolute must!  The waitress brings out this perfectly arranged aligned plate of chopped lettuce, chopped smoked salmon, trail mix, cous cous, and corn.  She mixed this all up with their amazing dressing and served the two portions.  It was an amazing explosion of different tastes and textures ranging from smoky salmon to sweet little raisins from the trail mix.  I could eat this every day!

For small plates; we went with the Burrata with Avocado and olive oil which was  a very tasty combination and a great start.  From there we went with the Wild Boar meatball which was although this was what brought me here, it was my least favorite dish.   Next we had the most amazing and interesting dish of the night, Pork Belly served on a toasted pumpkin bread.  This was absolutely amazing!  The salty and fatty pork belly was so perfectly matched with the sweet crunchy pumpkin bread.  I cant stress enough how amazing this was!  Our last plate was the Tiger Shrimp with corn and bacon.  The shrimp was perfectly grilled, the corn mixed with bacon was a great addition to the dish.

We were to full for dessert however all looked amazing including a dish that had ice cream made with duck fat. Cmon, really!

A must next time I'm in Scottsdale again or maybe this is the reason to come to Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I have been to this airport restaurant a few times now. I like it. Here's why:

They have seating. Yes, it's a sit down spot where you can catch your breath and relax. I'm usually coming off a long business trip and it's nice to take a minute before jumping on a plane.

Booze. They have a bar with your basics to help you unwind a bit before departure. 

They veganize! It really shouldn't be so difficult to find vegan options these days but many airports just haven't caught up. All the pre-packaged stuff has meat, cheese or both. This place has always been able to veganize for me. 

Service. Always friendly, fast and make the experience feel like you're not sitting in an airport. 

If any of those options interest you, and you're in Terminal 4 at B gates, go."}
{"text":"The worst service I have experienced since moving to AZ two years ago ! Overpriced and food was  ordinary. The waiter served me a desert from their fixed price menu instead of but like the one I ordered and it 
Bread pudding was harder than a rock. Speaking of rocks the cement wall and padless hard wood chairs did nothing for my comfort or the ambiance."}
{"text":"Have the chopped salad, which they toss at your table. Perfect blend of flavors and textures. Then opt for the ELK. Medium rare and prepared perfectly, was juicy and flavorful.Shared the bread pudding which is unique with layered slices versus chunks of bread. After three days of dining our guests talked about their meal here more than anywhere else. Just go!

Live in SanFran area, and visit this place every time in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"This place is overpriced, poor menu design and flat out unimpressive.  Considering the price tag, I expected a lot more.  This place underdelivered like Alex Rodriguez in the playoffs."}
{"text":"Perfect dining experience. Started off with their cherry cocktail and it was so good I had two!  My friend and I shared the dungeness crab enchilada for an appetizer.  We had to sit for a moment to enjoy the aroma before digging in and we knew it was going to be amazing..as it was. The guacalmole salsa is the best I have ever had. I didn't want that course to end. I admit I made sure no one was looking and sopped up the sauce with my finger.:)

I had the \"Testosterone Salad\". The tenderloin melted in my mouth and the fresh greens were perfectly covered in dressing. Every bite a delight.

My friend got the \"Exotic Mushroom Pan Fry\" and had a similar experience. Every bite a different flavor. Both of our dishes were great examples of this incredible menu that I have to sample one of everything from!

Since it was her birthday we ordered the \"birthday cake\" for dessert and it was simply the best cake I have ever eaten. The chocolate cake was light and the marscapone frosting made to perfection.  I don't care for super sweet desserts and this was just right. Take note other bakers..too much sugar spoils the dessert!

Pefect service and wonderful atmosphere will have me bringing friends and guests back !"}
{"text":"Another AZ restaurant week stop. It was a busy Saturday night when we ate so I think wait time for our food was a little longer than usual. We did the special three course menu, but added the mushroom dish and the stetson salad courses. We also got a side of truffled Mac n cheese. I know, I know we are fatties. Of the starters we tried the meatballs and deconstructed sushi roll. The meatballs were AHmazing. Sushi roll idea was cool and tasted good, but paled in comparison to the meatball dish. Mac n cheese was creamy an decadent, truffle flavor was not overpowering. Mushrooms were good, but kind of forgettable, would not get again. Stetson salad is a winner, I could have just eaten a full sized version as my entree. Speaking of entrees, we got the flat iron steak and red snapper. The steak was cooked to perfect medium rare. The snapper was a little dry. We weren't blown away by either entree to be honest. Thankfully we ended on a very happy note with dessert, the flourless brownie and lemon poppy bread pudding. I could have eaten double portions of both despite being absolutely stuffed."}
{"text":"Airport business is hard. They stepped it down for this extension to the scottsdale classic. Food is weak and overpriced for what they provide here. Try harder. Might be confused with chilies."}
{"text":"The fact that I'm even allowed to eat out in Arizona is...well, lucky. If it were up to my Jewish grandmother, we'd clean out her freezer. She'd be happy, but we certainly wouldn't! But since she admitted her alcohol stock is not up to par compared with the amount of food she has stored away, my boyfriend and I were permitted to seek out a quiet spot to enjoy some late evening drinks.

When we stumbled upon Cowboy Ciao in the Old Town Scottsdale area, I was thrilled, because in contrast to the other nightspots around, Cowboy Ciao seemed promisingly chill, and it is! Bistro-y with a soft Southwestern vibe, I would have LOVED to eat here for dinner--so many delicious choices: the cabernet rubbed filet mignon, Hawaiian Ahi tuna, lamb shank, pork belly, their famous bread pudding...the list goes on. 

Alas, we sat at the bar and were astonished to find Cowboy Ciao has been acknowledged to have one of the most diversified wine lists...anywhere. Fabulous. To accompany that, many wines by the glass are offered and affordable. To TOP that, they offer wine flights! Oh, the delight! I ordered up the Pink Bubbles flight (teehee!) with three glasses of international rosé. Each had distinct difference, all were refreshing, and the flight came with a personal print-up of what I was going to imbibe. Did I take it with me? No, of course not, I was too drunk on rosé to remember! =)

While our bar experience was lovely, the next time I am in town, I'm going to convince ol' granny to bring us back to Cowboy Ciao...and chow down on some exquisite sounding plates."}
{"text":"This is probably the best airport bar I've been to. I had an hr to kill and decided to stop here before my flight back to LA.

I walked on over and they initially had an issue with accepting cards and were cash only, but that was fixed by the time I left 2 drinks later. 

There was open bar seating and I usually hate sitting at the bar by mself, but its the airport so eveyone is pretty much by themselves. Plus, i used the convienant outlets right underneath the countertop to charge my phone. 

The bartender was great. I can't remember his name but he was helpful with recommendations and very entertaining as he sang to the overhead music. 

I ended up getting a beer to start and then had a glass of Zinfandel to finish. The lady sitting next to me had it and recommended it, which was great. I had never actually had a glass of Zinfadel before then. It was funny because she had commented that no matter what time it is in the airport, people are always drinking. Granted it was 6pm when she said that, but her statment was true nonetheless. 

She also got the quesadilla which apparentlynis a restaurant favorite. I guess I'll have to come back for that. Great experience and I would gladly come back again."}
{"text":"This may be one of the best airport restaurants in the US. Pricey, yes for an airport but I think worth it. The chopped salad was one of the best salads I gave ever had. Very, very unique. I will always come back here when I am at PHX"}
{"text":"Went here for my 30th birthday celebration last week - I've been wanting to try this place for so long! We got a great little table by the window and I loved the dim lighting and ambiance. It was definitely a great date place, although a bit loud. 
We started with the mac and cheese - YUM! Cheese, truffle, and porcetta - can't go wrong there. It was the perfect size to split for an appetizer. I ordered the Stetson Chopped Salad after hearing about it so many times. I hate to say that I was very underwhelmed. The lettuce was wilty and white, the corn was not fresh, but dry (reminded me of the corn in the  Cup of Soups), and...no avocado? Say whhhatt?
He got the filet mignon and oh man it hit the jack pot. I may or may not have eaten a few large bites of that. It was melt-in-your-mouth yummy and the mashed potatoes it sat on were creamy and delicious.
Their wine list is extensive and amazing. I hear their craft cocktails are great, too. 
We finished off with a slice of their birthday cake with a candle. It was REALLY good. I believe it was chocolate cake with cheesecake frosting. Such a great way to end the meal. 
I will be back for sure, but will get something other than the chopped salad! (Sorry, but Citizen Public House's is better)."}
{"text":"Thought I'd get the salmon salad here because I'm gluten free and choices in the airport are limited.   The cashier was helpful in getting the fried corn which was breaded off the salad,  but then there was all this pasta  in the salad that looked like rice that was unlisted in the menu.   Also that salad was very pricey at $20 (even for airport) . So in the end the menu was inaccurate I got glutenated and the food was expensive."}
{"text":"If you really love mushrooms get the mushroom dish it comes in a smaller version and is perfect with the asiago bread!"}
{"text":"Terrific experience on 2/13/14 at the bar, entertained and taken care of by Sean (Shawn) whose detailed information helped us finally decide on a fabulous dessert.  The atmosphere is charming and fun.  We didn't make it for dinner, but what we saw coming out of the \"Home on the Range\" kitchen looked fabulous!"}
{"text":"Ask for TJ, great service, enthusiastic, total professional and you can tell he loves what he does.

Try the Mac N Cheese (best mac and cheese I've ever had)

Also try the Stetson chopped salad with Salmon, even if you're not a salad person, you will absolutely love it."}
{"text":"One of my favorites by far. I crave the Stetson chopped salad and open face steak sandwich. Food and service are impeccable. If I'm ever in the area I stop in."}
{"text":"Amazing place to eat.
My favorite hands down is their chopped salad but warning you now...it's addicting! I'm not kidding!
You can have it vegetarian or pick your protein, either way, it's different and incredible!"}
{"text":"Loved.  For upscale Scottsdale, this was a very reasonable place to have a nice dinner.  The Halibut was the BOMB!  The curry was not spicy at all, which I liked.  Service was a bit slow - but we were in no hurry and it was a Saturday night.  We are definately going back here when in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Haven't even tried the food. Yelp says they are open till 10 but apparently kitchen closes at 8"}
{"text":"Unbelievable food! Plays on every taste bud! Great ambience, wonderful waiter. Had a memorable culinary experience! Please listen to everyone and get the Stetson salad, the duck is wow! Smoky flavor delicioso! Overall best restaurant for us in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Cowboy Ciao is overall well rounded. Great interior design, fantastic service, and well cooked filet. It is also a good place to go just for dessert. The white chocolate blondie and  bread pudding are my favs."}
{"text":"This restaurant is as good as most of the reviews say it is.  First, the service was impeccable and the atmosphere was great.  From the outside, it looks like it would be ultra pretentious due to the dim lighting, but I was pleasantly surprised to find it was much more laid back.

We sat at the bar because the restaurant was so busy, where Maryanne was our bartender and server.  She did an amazing job despite having to tend to the needs of about 15 other people sitting at the bar.

The food we ate was absolutely incredible.  I can't recommend the \"Stetson Chopped Salad\" enough -- the menu doesn't tell you anything about it other than how good it is.  Trust me, it's mind blowingly good and you should order it.

The New Zealand peppercorn Lamb was fantastic as well. Cooked perfectly and well seasoned. 

When I'm back in Scottsdale, I'm making it a point to come here again.."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service! One of the servers \"TJ\" damn near ripped a plate out of my friend's hands and told her that he'd just take the food if she wasn't going to eat the dish right! Like seriously dude?! Y'all need some serious customer service training! I gave it one star because zero stars wasn't an option."}
{"text":"We had dinner @ their restaurant in Scottsdale last night, and this place may be better!  We are @ the bar and the service was awesome! 

Hayley had the chop salad (they offer chicken here too, instead of salmon) and I had the testosterone salad...really good."}
{"text":"They clean the tables and bar and rinse the rag with the same water they rinse the \"clean\" glass ware with.  Nasty!!!!"}
{"text":"Cowboy Ciao was so good! We had a bunch of the appetizers and the salad was the best on the menu. It's right in the heart of Scottsdale so perfect for a date night or a night out with friends."}
{"text":"Running through the airport to my flight and thought I would sit down for a quick bite to eat.  The breakfast menu was small with only 5 items but they all looked good so I thought I would give it a go.

My waitress sat me fast and obviously had too much coffee this morning but no big deal, she was nice.
I opted for the Monday Quesadilla, apparently they decide what's inside every Monday.  Mine was filled with Oaxaca and Jack cheese, short rib and egg topped with chipotle sour cream drizzle and fresh Pico de gallo.  YUM!  I scarfed it up so fast my waitress thought I dropped the plate.

Airport food at Phoenix Sky Harbor has definitely been changing for the better and this was just another example of how a local restaurant can serve the same great food in an airport location.

Next time I'll try the Chocolate Chip Pancakes!"}
{"text":"This place is a joke! They boast a wine list of 2000 wines, but try to order one. We have been coming here for 14 years and have never been able to get our first choice of wine. On this visit, our first choice was a bottle that was also available by the glass. Our server said she couldn't sell us a bottle, because they didn't have enough, and had to save it for single glass servings. What? Why is it on the bottle menu then? Also if you are selling this by the glass I would assume that you have many bottles in stock. So we continued our selection process. And on the 5th try we finally got a bottle. Every time we chose a bottle, the server had to go look for it, while we had to wait for her to come back, only to tell us it was out of stock. Each time she suggested another wine at a much higher price. Had she offered us her selection at the price of our preferred choice, we would have taken it. The entire wine selection process from our initial request to actually getting the bottle took 40 minutes. Absolutely ridiculous! They don't know what they have in stock, and can't find what they do have in a timely manner. I asked our server if they use a computer to track the inventory and locations and she said the owner doesn't do that because it is too difficult. The owner here is obviously clueless. They filed for Chapter 11 earlier this year, and that does not surprise me. The quality of the food has suffered too. They are probably trying to save money to pay the creditors. My prediction is that they will close down soon. What was once one of our favorites is now a place we will never return too. Stay away, you will only be disappointed"}
{"text":"Very similar to the Citizen's down the street.  The food was decent, but there was nothing special about the drinks.  I would have rated them 3.5-4 stars, but the amount of bloody, dried, human fluid on bathroom wall will keep me from coming back.  The women's bathroom had 1 stall working out of 3.

I expect more when I pay $175 for dinner for 2."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a must when you're visiting the area. It's got a great vibe and ambience, the wine list is out of control, food amazing and the service is just above and beyond. We had the tiger prawns, Filet Mignon and sword fish...soo good. Take your time and enjoy yourself when you get the chance to visit cowboy ciao :)"}
{"text":"Came again and had the chopped salad.  It was amazing.  They have the best service of any airport.  The food is always great."}
{"text":"The prawn/shrimp appetizer was delicious.  The chopped salad was also pretty amazing.  Not as great as the citizen public house, but pretty good for airport food.  I was going to give it a 4 but I gave CPB that rating.  Service was excellent. You could do worse with PHX offerings."}
{"text":"Ate here once, and its just OK
If it was not in an airport, I would not go back...  lol"}
{"text":"Great food, service and drinks! Buffalo carpaccio is a must have! The wine list will take you days to read something from it and then start reading"}
{"text":"Our first time for Cowboy Chiao. The chopped salad with avocado was delicious. My new favorite chopped salad. Large portions, come hungry. Short rib with Dijon Yukon mash and Brussels was tasty and different. We are so full, that we are taking a bread pudding home to share later."}
{"text":"Their chopped salad is amazing! I ate one there and then got another to go. The staff was friendly too. It's pretty dark and loud in there esp for a Sunday but I think that's what they are going for. Will be back just for the salad!"}
{"text":"Heard about this place since I moved to the area. The Stetson salad is how good as they say it is. I've been back few times more. Always end up with the same thing. It's delicious."}
{"text":"The consummate out-of-towner restaurant in Scottsdale. They play up the whole cowboy thing and blend it to create Southwestern Italian. (Which, by the way, I vote to officially change to \"spaghetti western\"). 

The food is creative and the ambiance is fun and pleasant, but I was not completely blown away by the tastebuds, which I like my five star restaurants to do. 

Still, a can't miss for anyone who is visiting Old Town Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Ordered 4 breakfast meals. The biscuits and gravy were average. The chicken quesadilla wasn't good - avoid it. 

The only winner was the chocolate chip pancakes. Good flavor and well worth it. 

Our first time here will also be our last time here."}
{"text":"A wise friend once told me that any type of \"cheek\" on the menu must be delicious so order it...beef cheek, fish cheek, and of course, pork cheek.  On Cowboy Ciao, it's an appetizer called Cheeky Porky, and the pork cheek is served with corn cakes with aioli and micro greens.  The only miss was the air dried corn that was chewy like uncooked corn.  Decent sized cheek(s), so much so that i ordered this appetizer as a meal.  They also had Fever Tree ginger beer on the menu, which I love.   

The \"Cowboy\" part of Cowboy Ciao is evident in the decor and ambiance...wood everywhere, cheap-ish chandelier draped with beads.  Very friendly staff...there's an open window at the bar where watching the chefs prepare food kept me entertained."}
{"text":"Shiny

I've been to chow here a number times and the food is relatively consistent.  For the money, go for the pork shank, lamb or short ribs.  Those are my go-to dishes when dining here.  Unfortunately, they're also a little hit or miss.  On my last visit, the short ribs were dry and not as fork tender as it should be.  At $30+ for the entrees, I would expect a lot better execution.  

To wash it down, you can check out their extensive wine list.  I love the organization of it: by varietal and, subsequently, ascending by price.  I can't count the number of times I've had to hunt through a binder for bargains.  Here, I can just figure out my price range and hunt each varietal until I find something. 

I've never ordered any of the appetizers, though they all look good.  But no, I save myself for the deserts.  Well, the bread pudding to be specific.  This is probably a top 5 bread pudding for me.  So rich and tasty I could make a meal out of it.  

Now, other than eating a meal or desert, you could come here just for the popcorn.  Orville Redenbacher got nuthin on this stuff.  Caramel, bacon and chocolate.  This is the kind of stuff I LIVE for.  If you're visiting from out of town, pay the $7 and buy a bag to eat on the plane (and watch your neighbors drool).

They also used to make a P-H-E-N-O-M-E-N-A-L bacon peanut brittle.  The bacon peanut brittle is, quite simply, a necessary addition to anyone's diet.  I've had the walnut bacon brittle, and while tasty in and of itself, is simply not as good as the peanut version.  My last two visits they didn't have any, but I intend to bang on their door every time I'm in Scottsdale just to check.  They're lucky I don't live in Scottsdale anymore or else they'd make some just to get rid of me.  

Sure, you can come here for the food (to which I would have given 3 stars) and wine, but the bread pudding and brittle make this place shine."}
{"text":"This place does not need another review, but I'll chime in anyway.

I have been dreaming of coming her for several months after countless hours of drooling over their website.

I went for a late lunch with the Gorgeous Gabi.  
We had the restaurant all to ourselves, it was quiet and comfortable.

I ended up just ordering a salad, it was so hot out (surprise) and I just wanted something light. 
I got a Diet Coke and the Caesar Romero Salad (see pics) it consisted of; mixed greens with cilantro dressing, grilled lemon/herb chicken, fontina, cherry tomatoes and toasted pepitas. 

It was really good, I like the mixed greens in place of the usual romaine and although I didn't taste much cilantro it had great flavor.

Our waitress was not very attentive at all, when she did come around to grab my empty glass of soda she did not ask me if I'd like another, instead she brought me a glass of water.........with a bug in it! 

I'm giving 3 stars for now, but I will go back because there are still quite a few things on the menu I'd like to try."}
{"text":"Pro tip: Hike Camel Back mountain before and work up an appetite if you want to feel all the feels. 

Stetson chopped is Beethoven's 9th in food form. 
Pork Barbacoa tastes like home. And, I'm from Australia, which doesn't even make sense. It's so good you won't remember major facts about your own personality.

Cocktails are legitimately incredible, too. Their semi-secret concoction called the 'One (upon a) Time' truly tastes like stuff, although I still cannot figure out what. How the cocktail menu puts it: \"Barely legal pisco/coca leaf thing\". Whatever it is, it's totally delicious. Moving on, the Duchovny & Punching is a cocktail in a class of its own. It's some sort of confusing clarified buttermilk thing with a bunch of other things in it which ultimately manifests into something so refined and pure it's what I would fill all the water fountains of heaven with if I were god. 

+ excellent and friendly service. So yeah, 5 white hot stars."}
{"text":"We decided to dine here for our anniversary and we couldn't have been more pleased! For drinks we ordered a Manhattan and a brandy old fashion (both were good!). For an appetizer we ordered the buffalo carpaccio and it was delicious. This place is definitely quality over quantity and we finished the plate wanting three more orders, ha. For our main course I had the jerk seared ahi-tuna and it was to die for. The sweet potatoes and the tuna were my favorite thing on the plate. My husband ordered the grilled swordfish and it melted in his mouth. SO GOOD. We got the bread pudding for dessert and it was the best thing we could have ordered to finish off the night. 

HIGHLY RECOMMEND."}
{"text":"So, I had to head out to Nevada for work - and as I am wont to do, I scheduled my layovers (length AND location) based on meal times.  Lunch in Charlotte, NC and dinner in Phoenix.  Wandered the airport, and with the aid of Gate Guru and Yelp - found this place.

And boy, am I glad I did.  I was seated quickly, ordered my beer and started perusing the menu.  As I read the menu - I noticed that they were carrying primal cuts of meat, and fresh vegetables and proteins into the kitchen.  That's a good sign for any restaurant, much less one in an airport.  

I was debating between a couple menu items, and when the waiter came by - I asked which he would order.  He said if I don't find myself in Phoenix very often (which I don't), I should definitely try the Lester.  So, as I have found out in the past - trust a server's recommendation.  Wow.  Just wow.  I don't think I have a vocabulary large enough to describe the flavor explosion that happened in my mouth.  It was AMAZING.

A perfectly cooked burger, topped with bacon, green chili pulled pork, and avocado.  My mouth is watering just thinking about it, and I'm writing this review three months later!  Service was very good, and - it's definitely a good place to grab a bite on your way to your connection.  I was in and out within 40 minutes (I had a 1 1/2 hour lay over) - and I assume had I not ordered the large beer, and taking it to go - I would have definitely made my flight with plenty of time to spare.

The only downside?  It's in an airport, so the atmosphere (I was seated right next to the hustle/bustle of people trying to make their connections) leaves a little to be desired in certain parts of the restaurant.  But, on the other hand - I've never thought higher than 3 stars for any food in a restaurant in an airport before.  So, the next time I find myself at Phoenix Sky Harbor - I know where I'm headed for dinner!"}
{"text":"Most amazing salad ever. They also have some outlets, and my server was very nice. The margarita was so-so. Still, this place made my flight delay more bearable and I'm going to be craving the chopped salad for awhile."}
{"text":"I am in love.  This restaurant does everything a good restaurant should.  Ambiance, service and product were good.  The only disappointment I had was with the hour wait on the Monday we went without a reservation.

My party of four had an excellent time celebrating a birthday.  Two had the short ribs.  Tender to a fault, served with delicious Bar-B-Que sauce and pecan grits.  One had the fillet with a spicy aioli and delicious potatoes.
My meal was a huge pork chop, stuffed with Maytag bleu on a ancho bread pudding.  

For an app I split the chop salad.  It deserves special mention and I do recommend it, but it is not a sustaining salad, more of a amuse-bouche.  For dessert we split the peanut-butter cheese cake, delicious.

The beverages deserve some mention.  The wine list is this restaurants' only fault, it is tooooo long.  There is a smaller, delicious by-the-glass selection.  The beer selection is well crafted.  I had two of my favorite beers, Dogfishhead Chicory Stout, something I had only had by bottle, wonderful.

I normally don't like high-priced eateries b/c there is often a lack of creativity, Cowboy Ciao doesn't disappoint.  Recommended over any Capital Griller or Flemmingsery for creativity and value for dollar."}
{"text":"I loved the look of this place and really wanted to love the food here... I'm a huge truffle mac & cheese fan.. but that's probably my problem because I'm from NY and well Ny always does everything right in my eyes lol. plus I've had the best truffle & mac in the city :) but yeah this truffle mac & cheese didn't do it for me at all. 

I did love the coke served in coke bottles though and the look of the place! it's in a great area and if I got something else on the menu I'd probably be happier. my husband loved his meal so that's good."}
{"text":"We came to Cowboy Ciao for southwestern fare on Mother's Day, and the experience was pleasant and memorable. During our visit, the circular interior was colorful, inviting, and festive. There were several large families and groups on hand, followed by those seated by the large windows looking onto the streets of Old Town Scottsdale. Despite the constant foot traffic and high noise level, the atmosphere was casually laid back and unassuming. 

The Stetson Chopped Salad ($13) came with Atlantic smoked salmon, couscous, chopped arugula, dried corn, pumpkin seeds, black currants, asiago cheese, balsamic, and tomatoes. The salad was neatly arranged in rows, and tossed with just the right amount of creamy buttermilk dressing. The salad was colorful and vibrant. The sweet corn, arugula, currants, and pumpkin seeds added a range of textures and tastes, and the flavors of the cheese, sweet tomatoes, and smoked salmon then gave depth to round out the edges. It was delicious.

The Tiger Prawns ($14) was our favorite dish of the meal. It came with grilled prawns arranged in a mix of green chile corn, hominy, cotija cheese, aioli, lime, and cilantro. To sum it up, it was layers of textures, sweet ingredients, complicated by a hint of lime and chile with bursts of wow factor. I recommend it.

The Mushroom Pan Fry ($15) arrived with 9 different types of mushrooms, ancho cream, double cooked polenta, cojita cheese, avocado, tomatoes, and grilled portabellini. The mushroom stir-fry gave an earthy tone to the dish, with cheese, avocado, and tomatoes to add contrast to lighten the flavors. I wished the texture of the mushrooms were varied to showcase its rich heterogeneity. The cheese could also do a better job at connecting the mushrooms to the firm blocks of polenta. Don't get me wrong, the polenta itself was delicious too, but without an intermediary, the double cooked texture was not enough to bridge itself to the onslaught of rich ingredients. 

They had an extensive wine list, so we also enjoyed the Sky Ciao ($14), which was a flight that included 3-ounce pours of pinot grigio, pineapple wine, and syrah. All three selections were enjoyable, but I liked the pineapple wine the best.

To celebrate Mother's Day, the restaurant also gave complimentary Mimosa and Chocolate Brownies as a parting gift. The Mimosa was a nice opener, and wished there were refills as we waited for the food to arrive. The Chocolate Brownies were some of the best I had tasted. Not too sweet, there was a depth of rich dark chocolate flavors with plenty of soft dark chocolate chips embedded. The restaurant should consider giving these out more frequently.

The only downside to our experience was the wait for the food to arrive. It was Mother's Day and the restaurant was not filled to capacity, so there was no reason for them to be short on staff in the kitchen. Since they did not give out bread before meal, the wait became unbearable and frustrating after a good 45 minutes. These were management issues that are easily solvable, so hopefully they will not overlook them. On the other hand, our server Geoffrey was friendly, accommodating, knowledgeable, and attentive. We would be interested in returning to try their Buffalo dishes, as well as their menu for the Arizona Restaurant Week."}
{"text":"Tiger prawns are more like little shrimps. Disappointed. Not impressed by the service. Will not come back"}
{"text":"I would choose to eat here even if it wasn't at the airport. The food was actually pretty good! I was really hesitant about ordering my salad because I didn't think it would be filling but on the contrary! It really was so delicious! The dressing was phenomenal... I even started to dip my husband's chips in the dressing!! Go for the Stetson salad!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to enjoy this place more after so many raved about it. They especially insisted we try the short rib, as did our server. 

We ordered the bruschetta, short rib and salmon. The salmon was wonderful. The bruschetta were good but there was a ton of red chili flake in the mushroom version which overtook the whole thing. I typically love spice but this was overpowering. The short rib had great flavor but was SO tough and dry. I imagine short rib to be tender and fall apart at the fork. This was difficult to cut into with our butter knife. 

The service was wonderful and our server was friendly and attentive. I'm hoping I can try it again on our next visit as I left disappointed."}
{"text":"Wonderful lunch at Ciao! Wife and I both had Wild Boar Meatballs! Delicious! Service was excellent."}
{"text":"Really great place. 

Popped by here on a early morning layover. 

The guys working the bar area were extremely friendly and offered my wife and I seats immediately. 

I had one of the specials. And the wife had the biscuits and gravy with an egg over easy on top. This was a first for her and for years I have been asking her to get this dish prepared this way. 

She was instAntly in love and started regretting every biscuit and gravy dish she has had before. 

Sometimes you have to just listen to your husband. And/or the bartender/server."}
{"text":"Great experience. Had dinner here last night.  Sat at bar with bartender Mari who was very attentive to all and gave great service. She made awesome drinks too! Stetson salad and pastrami baked short ribs delish. Will go  back again and again!"}
{"text":"Everytime I visit my uncle in Apache Junction, we sample at least one of the Phoenix  Metro Area's finest epicurean adventures. On this visit, we selected Cowboy Ciao, based on the outstanding rating and reviews in Yelp. Yelpers, you didn't let us down! This is absolutely THE BEST place we've experienced on all of our sojourns, and we've been to some really good places! There's lots of good stuff to talk about, but the food was so out-of-this-world, let's focus on that. We started with the Mini Mushroom Pan Fry, a smaller version of their \"signature dish\". The ancho sauce was so incredible that we ordered a ciabatta, not because we really wanted bread, but it would have been criminal to leave even a drop of the sauce behind. Next we had a special appetizer, seared scallops with a shrimp bisque. The scallops were melt-in-your-mouth perfect and the bisque became the next target for the ciabatta, which itself was served with two absolutely delicious olive spreads. We couldn't imagine the dinner getting any better than what was already perfect, but our main courses delivered! We both had the duck breast, a new addition to the menu, replacing the Duck Duck Duck. The duck breast was prepared expertly, rare on the inside, with crisp skin, and bathed in another killer sauce, this time ancho-orange. All remaining scraps of ciabatta were used to wipe our plates clean. We washed all of this incredible food down with a bottle of 2002 K Vintners Syrah, a steal at $62. Their wine list is the largest I have ever seen, but our attentive waiter, Bryan, recommend the K Vintners, and we savored every drop. Bryan was very knowledgeable about the menu and deftly guided us through our completely over-the-top dining experience. Alas, there was no room for any of the many interesting and tasty-sounding desserts. Next time we'll have to plan ahead for those! And there will be a next time...and another...and another..."}
{"text":"Love Cowboy Ciao & the airport location does not disappoint. I was bummed that we came in the morning so I couldn't get the Stetson salad (well maybe you can order it but I felt like I needed to order actual breakfast). I got the simple breakfast (thats my name for it, i forget what its actually called) -- eggs, bacon, potatoes, and an English muffin & it was delicious. Exactly what I wanted. My boyfriend got the breakfast enchiladas & they were also to die for. Our serve, TJ i think, was awesome. Super satisfied. Excited to go back."}
{"text":"I'd definitely come back here. Thanks to some recommendations from another site (sorry, Yelp), we stopped in here for a nice dinner and thoroughly enjoyed it. We had the chopped salad, mini mushroom pan fry, and the puerco lento.

The chopped salad was super interesting and had really nice texture and flavour. The mushroom pan fry was good, but I thought it was a little oily. It was a huge portion, if you're into that. The puerco lento was seriously good, with meat that slid right off the bone.

Would definitely return next time we're in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"My faith in humanity and Cowboy Ciao are restored in one fell swoop. Marianne Belardi got back to me regarding my service issues and has made everything good in the world again.

I had recently moved within walking distance of the Ciao and was sad to think that the Cowboy had lost it's swagger. Thankfully, I can still confidently frequent the Ciao because the service is still there. One bad experience versus hundreds of great ones only means they are human."}
{"text":"Cowboy ciao is for sure one of the very best airport restaurant I've ever experienced !! Awesome food people have a great attitude !! Try this one out."}
{"text":"We have been a fan of this place for years.  The food is always fantastic.  However, our last visit left a bad taste in my mouth.  There were 6 of us there entertaining out of country guests for work.  We ordered sparkling water and at the suggestion of our waitress ordered a few for the table to share.  Upon arrival of the bill we realized that they charged $15 per bottle of sparkling water!  Not cool!  Had we not been entertaining for work I would have said something on the spot to our waitress but didn't want to make a fuss.  I think it worth noting here so others aren't left to be as shocked as we were."}
{"text":"WOW, as said before the chopped salad is amazing and I don't even like salmon-but the combination is terrific!  The Crab enchiladas were to die for; and my stuffed pork chop good, but not amazing.  Portions are huge, even the small plates, so think SHARE!  The wine list is over the top and a bit difficult to follow, but our waiter/som gave us good suggestions and guidance through the maze. Will go back next visit and be sending friends..."}
{"text":"Service was horrible! We waited over an hour for our food and our server Alexandra never assured us it was coming anytime soon. THEN she forgot my friends salad and entree altogether which she never even apologized for or reflected it on the bill. This place doesn't split checks which they don't tell you until you notice only one check is placed in front of you so after an already long dinner we had to have everyone add up what they owed and write it on the bill. The food was ok but by the time it came we had mostly lost our appetites. Def never going here again and wouldn't recommend it to friends"}
{"text":"Here I am, in the Phoenix area, on holiday.  I do my research, I book at Cowboy Ciao (believe it or not, hard to get in on a TUESDAY!!!) and I am blown away by this little house on the prairie.

What did we order?  We split the Mini-Mushroom Pan Fry appetizer.  Word to wise: SPLIT this as it was huge and for two it is plenty. Could even stretch to 3 or 4 depending on what else you get.  Continued with the Stetson Chopped but without meat.  Co-Diner had the Pork Rib Chop - holy crap was that huge and could EASILY serve 2 (Again!).  Drank alongsit local beer and trying out the wine flights of rosé bubbles.

+1 Star - The Dang Food!  I expected nothing better than amazing after all I read here.  Being a jaded Angeleno, though, I figured it would suck.  Wow.  I was wrong,  This place is as good as a top notch LA or NY eaterie.  Maybe even SF ;)
+ 1 Star - The Service.  This is where things get tricky for a quirky establishment as this one tries hard to be (I say this from reading all the funny/cute/quirky expressions on the menu and otherwise).  Its the question of: cool server or good server.  They hit the nail on the head with the combo of both.  Our waitress was complimented by an upbeat but smoothly disengaged seating person, a pleasant but also evasive expediter (person who brings out the food) and a wildly busy but expertly smooth bartender.  Plus all those geniuses in the kitchen who I did not see but deserve a round of applause.  The key to good service is each does their own job, and only their own, but makes the client feel fully attended to.  By sticking to their own job they prevent getting stymied with the wrong request to the wrong server (another cocktail? the waitress flows over... salt and pepper?  busboy's all over it).  These guys have it NAILED. I was impressed.
- 1 Star - Parking.  Pain in the ass area to park - how about valet, guys?
- 1 Star - Table coverings/table ambience.  This place is sexy.  Low lighting, just enough noise level to keep you from overhearing your neighbor but you can easily hear your date... But the tablecloths and napkins and the salt and pepper shakers seemed so... generic?  institutional?  I'm not saying go for pink terrycloth, but something a little quirky as befitting this joint.
+1 Star - Menu.  There is rarely a cheerful day for me, as a vegetarian (well, I eat fish, so I guess I am a pescatarian? ocaeanotarian), in eating out at a trendy joint.  These guys make the inner carnivore roar with the mushroom dish that taste like meat in the best meaning of the word.  And the Stetson salad with no meat?  I could eat that every day.  I have memorized the recipe and hope to try it at home.  Whomever decides what to rotate/change/introduce on the menu is pretty dang smart.
+ 1 Star - Ingredients.  It is a big pet peeve of mine to have fancy fixin's with crap makin's.  How can a salad be delish if the lettuce is off the nasty big truck that delivers to everyone from hospitals to the airport (we know whom I am referring to, right?!). I have the feeling that these guys are picking and choosing what they dole out.  And that makes a massive difference.
+ 1 Star - Chances taken.  Maybe not everything is a delight - I don't know cos after only 1 meal I am a convert.  But the excitement of a place that will serve an espresso rubbed steak, buffalo carpaccio, chile laced chocolate dessert... What fun they are having, and I did too!

I cannot wait to eat here again. If I didn't think it would make my travel partner nuts, we would eat every meal here our whole trip."}
{"text":"We always have a great experience at Cowboy Ciao.  The Stetson chopped salad is so good!"}
{"text":"Cowboy Ciiao is somewhat overrated. In iits heyday it was the place to go. Now the menu has become stale. There is nothing interesting on the menu besides their signature Stetson salad. otherwise bland. Too bad we use to love this place...hopefully they will reinvent their menu to keep up with the other restaurants who are."}
{"text":"Ahhh I have such fond memories of this place when I lived in Phoenix ages ago. My boyfriend and I would come here all the time for the expresso crusted filet and flowerless chocolate cake, we even came here on New Years one year and had a fabulous time. 

During my recent Phoenix visit I had to pop in for dinner with my bestie for the Stetson chop salad with salmon and although it had been forever it did not dissapoint. Literally the most amazing concoction ever. Its so fresh and flavorful I could eat it everyday! The place was just as I remembered romantic and casual with good wine and delicious food."}
{"text":"Came here for Arizona Restaurant week, and it was my first ever visit.  For an appetizer I ordered the burratta, which included proscuitto and had a wonderful mango? vinaigrette dressing drizzled over it.  Fabulous!!  Then came the mushroom pan fry.  OMG.  A party in my mouth and I've been craving it ever since.  Perfect flavoring.  The dessert was banana bread pudding, and while I'm a huge fan of bread pudding, this one disappointed.  Too dry for my liking.  They also had a wine flight special and the wines were very enjoyable.  Their wine list is ridiculous.  It's literally a book.  A little too overwhelming for me.

My companions ordered off the regular menu.  One friend ordered soup and salad and asked that the soup be brought with the entrees.  But it was served with the salad.  She again asked that it be brought out later so they took it away.  When it was brought out later it was cold and hardened potato soup.  My other friend's dish was also cold.  Both were reheated and the manager offered each of them a complimentary glass of wine which was really appreciated.

On the pricey side, so will probably come back when someone else is paying or I find a special deal.  But I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Not bad, but didn't blow me away. This is a classic, old-school restaurant which fits right in with Old Town Scottsdale. It's a little pricey for what you get."}
{"text":"This place proves that Southwestern cuisine is not dead and there's still room for lots of creativity.  Foodies and wine connoisseurs alike will enjoy just about everything on the menu.  Definitely order the chopped salad and let that begin the journey to an evening of culinary excellence."}
{"text":"We had girl's night dinner here and had a horrible experience. This was one of the worst snobby waitress stories I've ever had the \"pleasure\" of telling.

First, we walked in and it took 10 minutes for someone to come to the counter to consider seating us.

Second, or waitress was a jerk. I wish we got her name, because I would call her out on here (just in case, she's a skinny, pear-shaped woman with shoulder-length, brunette hair with bangs and a mousy face). She was not very attentive. It was busy, but we had to ask her for water quite a few times. We ordered our drinks and food (which took forever to come out, we had to ask if they forgot about our order)--one of the girls didn't realize her salad came with salmon (to be fair, the ingredients aren't on the menu), so she was going to scrape it out. The waitress sighed and said she'd have them remake it. My friend tried to say it was ok, but the waitress took it anyway. For the rest of our dining experience, water was scarce.

Then the real problem came.  We waited 30 minutes after we finished our dinner to get our check. Our waitress told us that she doesn't split checks (we are not sure if this is company policy or not). When she brought the check back, we split it up so she could charge all of our cards correctly. She said this was fine. She came back 15 minutes later and told us that we hadn't added a salad onto our cards. We had ordered 3 salads total. She had charged us for 4. We told her her mistake. She said she'd fix it.

She came back and gave us our checks and we were ALL mischarged (most of us over charged). We figured out through the math of all of our receipts that she had charged us for the salad, but had split up the costs on all of our checks. We told her this problem, and she responded with, \"This is why we don't split checks.\" We were very taken aback, but one of our girls said, \"If you would have split the check, we wouldn't have had this problem.\" She rolled her eyes and walked away.

Lastly, the food was ok, but I don't like much American Food. There are hardly any vegetarian options and no vegan options.

I wouldn't recommend eating here and I will never go again unless I have to."}

{"text":"Relatively easy to get in for an early lunch (say, when the doors open at 11:30am).  This place has a really neat menu.  Testosterone Salad with sirloin tips, greens, other stuff, and Potato Chips?  Pigs 'n puddin' which is pulled pork barbecued up on top of polenta.  Mushroom sandwich looked pretty darn good.  Seared tuna also looked tasty.  The item I ordered was the duck and brie melt sandwich.  Yum-O!  

This place is worth trying just to read the unique food selection the menu."}
{"text":"Honestly, if you're in another terminal and have the time, take the walk down to B just for the inspiring Stetson Chopped Salad. I asked my very enthusiastic server, TJ, to recommend a dish and it was the first thing out of his mouth. It's petty rare that a restaurant has a salad as a signature dish, and after having it I can see why it is.

I had it with the salmon, and then there's some dried sweet corn (sth new for me), couscous, chopped arugula, trail mix (you heard right) all in about-equal portions. This is less a salad and more just a delicious dish. If you don't like it, message me!"}
{"text":"A great place to experience some unique and innovative dishes.  The Stetson Chop, of course, is the highlight of my Cowboy Ciao experience, as it tends to be for many others.  But I've also had good luck trying other things on their menu, such as the Mini Mushroom Pan Fry, a less expensive alternative to the entree version."}
{"text":"I brought my wife here for dinner last night for our 7 year anniversary based on the rave reviews on Yelp and we were not disappointed.

First, I must say that the service was FANTASTIC. Best server and service we've had in a few years. 

Our server recommended the Chopped Salad to start with, mixed right at your table, and it did not disappoint. We substituted the normal salmon for chicken and it was delicious. He also recommended the short ribs which my wife ordered and she loved them. 

I had the Filet Mignon and it was cooked perfectly to order, large in size and nearly melted in my mouth. 

We finished our meal off with the Peanut Butter bar - not my absolute favorite dessert but it was gluten free so was a great for for my wife. Most of the menu by the way is gluten free. 

Highly recommend a visit here! We'll be back soon."}
{"text":"Delicious chow! Tender, flavorful steak on artisan ciabatta with handmade chips and melty blue cheese. I'd eat this again!"}
{"text":"Located in Terminal 4, to start, this was a last resort option because this airport lacks the presence of good restaurants.

I quickly scanned the menu before going in and sitting down and the only thing that really caught my eye was the filet mignon. Everything else was pretty mediocre.

The space is really small but they don't GAF, they've got tables crammed in to where you'll be touching elbows with your neighbor. It's like a family of 8 trying to cram all their kids into their two door Honda Civic. That's how I felt! No lie!

Received my food, my filet mignon ($33) was tough. The flavor was pretty good but the meat quality just wasn't filet mignon quality. The mashed potatoes were lame, made with some type of Dijon mustard, I don't like my potatoes to taste sweet unless it's yams.

I'll be coming back to Phoenix soon but this place has been crossed off my list."}
{"text":"I'm not a vegetarian but that delicious mushroom dish entree was what I needed. Much better than the $5 on a coffee or carb item I would like to stress eat till I get home. Take my money and thank you for making it taste good.

Oh and the service was fast and refilled my water."}
{"text":"Just got back home form here and couldn't wait to yelp about this place. Came here on a group event so we had the private dining area and a set menu. This place has amazing food and a wonderful staff that made everything even more amazing. 

I think everyone in our group had a great experience and enjoyed the food thoroughly. 

For starters we had the buffalo carpaccio and the quesadilla del dia. The buffalo carpaccio was amazing, flavorful and just the right amount of pickled shallot to balance off the the flavored. As for the quesadilla, I fell in love with the chess that was drizzled over the tortilla. 

The salad was the highlight of the dinner, our table unanimously agrees that it's amazing. It was the Stetson chipped and I highly recommend every one to get it. It's so complex in flavor yet wonderfully mixed together, between the crunchy, the soft, the creamy and all the textures you could think of. Just try it. 

I ordered the grilled swordfish, and it was very well prepared, as the sauce gave it that smoothness that it deserved, and the Peruvian potatoes along with the cauliflower were to die for. 

As I thought everything was done, spoons for desserts were presented and we get this bike size chocolate brownies  that's were covered with chocolate crumbles and set on a swoosh of chocolate sauce. I didn't capture its name as presented on the menu but it's chocolate and good, and tasty and a must try. 

I'll definitely come back here especially for that amazing Stetson salad. The staff made us feel welcome and our server in charge of the party \"Jeremy\" and his other co workers who served us were the stars of the show. 

Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"Amazing food!! What a surprise in an airport. We had the most delightful server named Terry. She couldn't have been more helpful with the menu and more professional and friendly with her service. I would definitely go back again and again!!!"}
{"text":"just two drinks and an appetizer in between flights.  Was trying to watch the football game, but they kept messing with the channels and changing channels, it was a little annoying, not sure why they were doing this, but people seemed agitated like us.  Didn't spend much time there, waiter was helpful but offered no suggestions. Took a shot in the dark, it was okay to pass the time."}
{"text":"I give this place a minus 10 for very rude customer service by the manager, Justin,  and for serving me slimy, rotten lettuce in my salad.
I confronted the Manager with the rotten lettuce and he looked at me with a straight face and told me this was how Spring mix looked!  He  then proceeded to accuse me of cheating the restaurant by eating the small bit of beef and leaving the rotten lettuce!  
I finally received satisfaction  after calling the Main Cowboy Ciao restaurant in Scottsdale.
Be ware!    The downtown restaurant claimed tome that  they do not own this branch, it is owned by HMS Host, this is fast food being served to you at the airport,  falsely advertising their affiliation with another Cowboy Ciao in downtown Phoenix.  
I have photos of the rotten lettuce which I sent along with complaint letter to Mr. Steve Thomas of  HMS Host and corporate offices of Cowboy Ciao.

Be careful if you decide to try this fast food establishment."}
{"text":"This is a tough review to write.  The location was great and I'm sure the dinner would've been good too based on the other reviews.
Unfortunately, my team didn't like anything on the pre-set menu and the restaurant didn't want to work with them on finding alternates.  
I was a restaurant manager, so yeah, I get it - the food has already been purchased and prepped, etc.  But there were only 8 of us; how hard is it to be flexible?  How hard is it to say, \"Yes of course, but we will have to charge you separately\"?  When a group that is spending a couple thousand dollars on dinner tells you they're going to leave before you even bring the appetizers out, doesn't that concern you?  Wouldn't you send a manager over?
If you're Cowboy Ciao, the answer to all of these is no.  What a bummer."}
{"text":"Everything was delicious.... our server Terry was terrific- or the lady who helped us all the way though- Az stronghold Rose' was nice to see since we are from their origin. Good food for an airport highly recommend!
Has the Ruben, Salad, and bruschetta!"}
{"text":"Best airport food in the country. 

I'm a cowboy/rancher and I approve of this beef. 

Not allowed to have steak knives in the airport sooo... They drop really tender beef on your plate. And they cook It to perfection. And in picky when it comes to how my meat is cooked. So to speak. 

Get the testosterone salad.

Eat beef."}
{"text":"Man, I really wanted to like this place, I mean, really, really like it.  Lick the plate like it.  So maybe my 3 star review is in reflection that it wasn't that.  Don't get me wrong, it wasn't bad, but it wasn't great, either.  Just.  Ok.  Three stars.  

I dig eclectic restaurants (see Medizona).  I love tossing flavor combos together in a way I hadn't imagined, so, for that, CCiao gets props.  I had the espresso rubbed filet (I like both of those things!) with smashed yukon potatoes (that sounds good) and a cabernet demi-glaze (whoa, cool).  Except, this dish was kinda the anti-Gestalt.  The sum was less than the parts.  

I wanted to like it.  I really did."}
{"text":"Great meal at iconic restaurant in old town... service was little slow and sat right next to the front door. But overall amazing food.. great wine list and happy to try it again!!"}
{"text":"I had the Stetson salad, it has smoked salmon on it - they're supposed to explain how it's different than a regular salad because on the menu it says something to the effect of, this is everyone's favorite. Not a very helpful description. No one explained it to me, but I had heard from a friend how good it was so I knew I was going to order it anyway. I'm pregnant so I am careful about what I eat and I knew it had salmon on it but I kind of figured it was cooked. When it came out, it looks nothing like a salad, there's no lettuce, which was fine, everything was very nicely distributed in rows with a small side of the dressing. The guy told me he'd be back to mix it all up for me but he never came back. I waited a few minutes and decided to mix it myself. 

When I saw it was smoked salmon, I was a little worried because I don't think you're supposed to eat that while pregnant. I did a little Googling and made the decision to eat it. And it was really really good. I would love to have it again, but I'll wait until after I have the baby. 

I can't give this place 5 stars because the service was a little chaotic it seemed. We had a larger party but didn't really receive much attention, and when we did, it would take a long time for them to come back. And it wasn't even busy. Our waiter didn't explain the menu as much as I feel they could have. And for the person that said ample parking, where did you park? Lol. I had to valet my car in order to be able to get a spot. I drove in and around the entire plaza twice and never found a spot. There are a ton of other restaurants and shops around so it is a very busy area, especially on the weekends."}
{"text":"The salad was mind-boggling.  Seriously, it was like a party in my mouth with so many unique flavors.  It wasn't very big, but I'll pay whatever it takes to taste that again.

The calamari was great by calamari standards, but it was small for the $10 price tag.  

The filet mignon was perfect.  That's all I need to say about that.

The mushroom dish was good, but I was expecting a lot more after reading all these reviews.  It definitely needs some meat, the polenta didn't cut it.

The bread pudding was very good, but I wasn't a fan of the licorice-flavored ice cream it came with.  

Overall, my food experience here was excellent and I'll be coming back."}
{"text":"As much as I hate Phoenix airport I love coming to Cowboy Caio.

I have been here numerous times and whether I am at a table or the bar the service is great! You can see the associates love working here and it seems like they are always having fun.

Unfortunately I always order the same thing which is the Chopped Stetson salad with avocado.  Prob one of my all time favorite salads.  The flavor & freshness never fails! With this being said all their plates look Delish but if I'm here I have to my salad!"}
{"text":"So grateful for a fun place to eat when stuck in PHX on a layover!

I asked one of the helpful attendants walking around the airport where I should eat, and she pointed me to Cowboy Ciao with no hesitation. She said that on occassion, she and her husband drive out there just to go eat the scallops. (She works there, so I assume that that's cool). 

Officially intrigued, I frolicked off to get the scallops. And they were awesome. They were crusted with some kind of nut (corn nuts? I think?), and served over a hearty risotto chock full of delicious veggies. Nothing on the menu looked boring. The guy next to me ate a burger topped with pulled pork, avocado, and a whole mess of other awesomeness, and declared that it was fantastic. 

Way to go PHX, for stepping up your game for hungry travelers!"}
{"text":"Do not go to this restaurant. They are quite rude. I just waited five minutes at the front reception area to be seated and was ignored. The woman at the reception area was on the phone having a casual conversation with a potential customer instead of noticing a customer in front of her. Other staff ignored me. Apparently they do not want business with walk ins."}
{"text":"WoW.  I was not expecting the food to be this good.  This place could compete in NYC where the world's best restaurants are.  If you want a special occasion spot where you KNOW the food will be divine this is the place to go. 

I had the pork loin and my friend had the filet.  Both cuts of meat were exceptional and perfectly cooked and seasoned.  The sauce on mine was OUT of this world, as in heavenly.  
I couldn't experience wine with my meal, because I am preggers, but my friend had a nice red from Washington that our waiter recommended.  It was excellent.  
We also had the peanut butter brownie upside downie- amazing.  It's a winner.

I have to take my hubby back here so he can experience this food.  
It will be a staple to take friends to when they come to town."}
{"text":"I have always been a fan of Cowboy Caio for dinner; but thought I would try Brunch when I had a friend in town from Hawaii, who wanted an \"Old Town Scottsdale\" experience.  Great food - I had eggs and hash.  The service was unattentive - asking for pepper (Not on the table); had to ask twice for Iced Tea refills  - and there were only 6 tables.
Overall, I'll be back for dinner, but probably not for lunch/brunch.  $60.00 for two (No alcohol) is a little steep for no value add's (i.e. A homemade mini muffin basket upon arrival, etc.) and unattentive service."}
{"text":"Amazing food and unique flavor combinations. You must try the Stetson Chopped salad. You'll wish you had a magic refillable plate. It's that good. Also loved the Berkshire Belly & Waffles and the Duck confit Relleno."}
{"text":"CC is pretty much a staple here. You have to try this restaurant at least once. Start off with the chopped salad and take it from there."}
{"text":"I always heard of the great food here and I had a chance finally to try it out. I'm a huge fan of large portions and my dish was gigantic. I ordered a braised pork with a creamy sauce and fingerling potatoes. It was just as I would have expected from a place like this. 

They are very busy and I can see why. The decor, and ambiance is very inviting for a couple to larger groups. I love the drinks and the wine list is a bit over whelming for a amateur wine drinker like me. 

I saw so many things on the menu I wanted to try but I did not want to look like a fatty in front of my date. I might have to sneak back over there on my next day off. 

I recommend this place to anyone who enjoys good food and doesn't have any hang ups of trying new things. Next is FnB!!"}
{"text":"Came here for a birthday dinner. I'd never heard of the place and checked out the menu beforehand to see what they offer. Ended up getting the famed Stetson salad with salmon and it was delicious! I loved the variety of tastes and textures and it all worked well together. Another person got it with avocado and another with chicken and they both enjoyed it as well. It reminded me of a salad I've gotten from the Original Chop Shop. However, our waiter was weird and awkward, which lessened our experience. He seemed annoyed with us and our questions. And I find it surprising that a restaurant can't split a check in 2015. He made us write down which person had which dish and how much each of our totals was, after the tax and gratuity was added. Food was fine but I probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Second time here on a layover.  Food is epic, wine list is excellent.  Had the pleasure of being served by a bartender/ninja, Ty.  I spent 20 years in the business and if I was still in it, he'd be one of my first hires."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Their chopped salad is one of the best I've had and their 9 mushroom dish with a creamy sauce and pimento is absolutely delicious. Wonderful wine selection, unique cocktails, charming ambience, and excellent service."}
{"text":"Delicious chopped salad. You Must order this salad!! It is the same as citizen public house but waaaaaay better. I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5 only because I think the menu could be better. It has staple items to order which it does amazingly like the mushroom dish, the chopped salad, and a few others but overall options are limited. 

I prefer it for lunch personally because of the chopped salad."}
{"text":"Lunch for 4.

- Ambiance (3/5)
A little jenky, a little eclectic.  

- Service (4/5)
Courteous and fast.

- Exotic Mushroom Stir Fry, $15 (3/5)
Great mix of mushrooms, though the cream sauce was a bit heavy.  The polenta was pretty good, though the tomato and avocado seemed a tad out of place.  

- Value (2/5)
Wasn't a fan of the portion size of the mushroom dish.  It kind of felt like there was just 1 of each kind of mushroom.  Certainly not \"mucho mushrooms\" as it says on the menu.

- Final Word
The chopped salad my friend got looked delicious.  Perhaps I should have tried that, as my dish, though consisting of some tasty mushrooms, was still a little heavy and a bit cheap on the portion."}
{"text":"The menu has more alcohol choices than good. So it loses 2 stars for that alone. Not a huge selection. And the food is meh. Several of the menu items are the chef's special of the day...like the quesadilla del dia. Today it was chopped steak, potatoes, and a bunch of other stuff in it. I just wanted chicken in mine. 

I'm not in the Phoenix airport often enough to be really annoyed, but it was tolerable in a pinch."}
{"text":"Went here when we were in town from San Francisco. We really enjoyed the variety, the wine pairings and the quality of food.  Service was good. The chopped salad  and scallops with beet risotto was the best!  We'll definitely stop by again next time we are in town."}
{"text":"As far as airport restaurants go, I enjoyed this place. They had a decent selection of food about the same price as other places. However, not much under $15, so if you are concerned about cost in the airport, this wouldn't be the best. I wanted a sit down place where I could drink and eat before my flight was delayed. Definitely over-priced for what it is, but that's life in an airport. If it cost this much outside an airport, I wouldn't be dining here, but pickings are slim for anything non-fast food in an airport.

I ordered the breakfast enchiladas. The only issue was the eggs were runny, but some of the white was not cooked. I prefer over easy eggs, so they weren't prepared well. However, I easily pushed the uncooked white to the side and was able to eat the rest without issue.

The chorizo wasn't super spicy but still tasted good. The drink menu was typical of an airport, so I had a cider since I didn't want to spend $13 on a cocktail. The service was also excellent. The waiter was very attentive, and the host chatted with me between customers since I was on my own waiting for my flight.

I've been to plenty of restaurants in airports and the food still sucks, since you're trapped in the airport. While they have the same prices, I liked the food and would be happy to go back if I was waiting in Terminal 4 again."}
{"text":"In love with their Stetson Chopped salad with salmon  literally have never tried anything else."}
{"text":"I have been to this var at least a dozen times but have never bothered to give it a review until tonight. I just had one of the worst travel days I had ever experienced when I met the bartender, Tige. He was so ridiculously friendly to all of his customers it actually bettered my mood! I had the bruschetta and it was quite good. If ever at the PHX airport stop in and see Tige! He will make your day!"}
{"text":"Visiting Scottsdale on a vacation, so we asked friends in the area where to eat.  Several mentioned this place and we were NOT disappointed. My wife and I shared the salad, which was very, very unique and had layers and layers of flavor.  We also shared the Tuna Poke (fantastic) and the duck (merely excellent), both of which were appetizers.  We couldn't finish all of the food!  I very, very rarely go for specialty cocktails as I find them overpriced and under \"proofed\".  The descriptions looked so interesting I tried one...and it was so good I tried another.  That is EXTREMELY rare for me to try one let alone two specialty cocktails.  Our service was fantastic, with a waiter that was knowledgeable and and obvious foodie himself.  This place is a half hour drive from where we are staying and we are going there again today!!!"}
{"text":"Great for an airport restaurant. Overall, friendly service and really solid food. We had the Stetson chop salad with avocado and the salmon and both really enjoyed our meals. Sat in a booth in the back and didn't feel like we were at an airport which is a nice break. Definitely recommend if you're looking for a real meal at the airport. It's overpriced for what it is but again, it's an airport so that's almost inevitable."}
{"text":"So I'd heard good things about Cowboy Ciao via Yelp and several food magazines. It was relatively close to my hotel so I thought I'd give it a try. I wasn't disappointed. While I wasn't blown away, the overall experience was great. I was there on a Tuesday night around 9pm and it was completely jammed. I found a seat at the bar and got wonderful service there. 

I had a glass of Layer Cake (Pinot Noir? can't recall) and ordered three appetizers. Their signature Stetson salad, pork belly with cabbage and sweet potato slaw and an appetizer portion of their other signature dish, the Mushroom Pan Fry.

People rave about the salad and I understand why. While not my favorite salad of all time, it is a wonderfully flavorful dish with interesting and tasty ingredients. Among other things, it had smoked salmon, cous cous, air dried corn, arugala and a creamy pesto dressing. Really fresh and delicious. Surprisingly light. 

The pork belly was fantastic. It was unbelievably flavorful and beautifully cooked. The only thing I'd say negatively was that it was a bit too fatty. I normally don't say that about pork belly but this piece just had a high fat to meat ratio and it was a bit much. That's not to say it wasn't delicious. The fat made it even more so, but I'm not sure everyone would be as big a fan as I was. The slaw was absolutely fantastic. Probably my favorite part of the entire meal.

I was a little disappointed by the Mushroom Pan Fry. I'm a huge mushroom fan and the dish promised to have nearly a dozen different types of mushrooms. It simply didn't. Mostly cremini's, a couple of shitaki and one morel. Not to be a stickler, but it certainly wasn't what was promised. That would have been fine if the rest of it was as good as hyped. The sauce simply wasn't that flavorful and the polenta was non-descript. It was creamy and tasty, but it left something to be desired.

For dessert I had the Peanut Butter Brownie with Brown Butter Ice Cream. The ice cream was fantastic and made in house like all of their ice creams. They normally serve this dish with the Roasted Banana Semifreddo but I decided to swap out ice creams. The peanut butter brownie was creamy and smooth and incredibly rich. I just couldn't eat the whole thing after everything else.

Overall, it was a really strong experience. The service was good despite it being very busy. The wine selection was great and most of the food was really wonderful. Whether I loved every dish or not, there is no denying that it was prepared beautifully, served nicely and came out promptly. All signs of a solid kitchen. Well done. I enjoyed myself and would definitely come back."}
{"text":"I have heard about this place from friends for years and have always wanted to try it. I used Restaurant Week as an excuse.

I wasn't crazy about the atmosphere. And our table was very tiny, cramped, and uncomfortable.

But the food was very good overall. For my starter I got the chopped Stetson salad without salmon. I really wanted the mac and cheese (I'm obsessed)  but it is made with bacon. Maybe they can try putting the bacon on top instead? It's a peeve of mine when restaurants put meat products in their mac and cheese considering it is one of the few veg options. My husband decided to torture me and order it as his starter and he said it was very good. Especially with the spicy tomato sauce on the side. Back to my chopped salad. It was divine! Beautiful presentation, fresh tasting ingredients, delicious dressing. I loved their crunchy \"trail mix\" in it. Before Cowboy Ciao, Postinos was the only place I would go specifically for their salad. But I might have to make a few trips to Cowboy for this delicious salad.

For the entree my husband got the scallops. He loved them. I got their famous mushroom stir fry. Was it good? Yes. Did I hear angels singing? No. Now, don't get me wrong, I do think it was tasty but not worth the hype. The sauce is what made it good. Delicious, slightly spicy, creamy sauce. Like another Yelper stated, I wish it was served with a little bread, maybe a crostini, to sop up all the leftover sauce.  The mix of mushrooms were nice and the polenta was so-so. A little dry and under seasoned. And I was disappointed with how much avacado and cotija cheese was on top. Barely any, more like a garnish. There needs to be more because it really helps make this dish so delicious!

Desserts were good. Just good. I got the bread pudding. I liked the pine nuts in it. Nice unique touch. My husband got the banana pudding which he enjoyed, however he was a little frustrated he was having issues breaking the chocolate shell it came in. But watching him was quite amusing.

Service was good. Our server was attentive, friendly, and helpful. We will be back, probably for lunch."}
{"text":"Cowboy Ciao will serve you a nice plate of food but will fail to excite.  I could serve these plates out of my own kitchen.   For example, braised short rib, red quinoa, steamed bok choy and a side of dipping sauce.  Pictures all these components separated on the plate as opposed to being plated on top of each other in any way.  Take your money elsewhere."}
{"text":"We came for early dinner on a Saturday, before the rush. Our waitress made a good effort to take care of us for the evening. What we ordered: 

The Stetson (salad with salmon)
Doubly Rare (bison tartare)
Nuts about Scallops
Jerk Seared Ahi Tuna
Niman Ranch Bone-In Pork Chop

The 4 stars are for the Stetson and the pork chop. The Stetson has it's own fabulous reputation and worth a every bite. Pork chop was perfectly cooked with great flavor.  We'll be back for these two dishes."}
{"text":"Wow cool setting for Gayle and myself lunch now. Sparkling water drink. Have asked for Scallops lunch, sharing tiger prawns app. Gayle had a suggested lunch salad. Everything was excellent, but cost $75. Fun to do, but a bit too much for regular visits...for us folks. But all was excellent, including service."}
{"text":"For airport food, this was the best salad ever. A bit pricey, but totally worth it. Sometimes it sucks to eat alone, but not this time. Waitstaff super friendly."}
{"text":"Had the duet bruschetta plate, the chicken tortilla soup and the burger. Tried two different wines, a chronic zin and an Argentina Malbec. Both were good with my burger. Of course it's pricey because it's in the airport, but the tables were clean, music not too loud and the service was good. I'd definitely go again on my way through Sky Harbor airport."}
{"text":"The \"Not Your Common Salmon\" was devine! Perfect service too!! I wish I flew to Phoenix all of the time to eat here! So glad I decided to keep walking thru the airport to find the right place for a quick gourmet meal!"}
{"text":"As a family of five we seated immediately on NYE. The atmosphere was pretty good it was just dark with cowboy decor so take from that what you will. We got the bruschetta type starter. It was good but definitely lower than expectations for such a high rated restaurant. I ended up getting the truffle Mac and cheese and that was impressive for a side that was seven bucks. As an entree I got the tomahawk pork chop which was a great quality pork chop but the flavor was no different than a homemade pork chop though. Overall for $150 it wasn't what we expected and was relatively disappointing."}
{"text":"On a Friday night around 6 p.m. I entered a dark space after searching for the door. Due to the excessive noise, I considered leaving, but what changed my mind was the gracious hostesses. Graciousness is rare, so I thought why not? Plus I wanted to try the famous Stetson Chopped Salad.

It took time for my server to reach me, but it was very busy. The noise was difficult to bear while I looked at the menu, other diners' dishes and the unusual cowboy-themed art I could see in the dim lighting. 

When she arrived, Alexandra was also gracious in addition to offering helpful menu advice and being nice. The menu is quite eclectic so advice is welcome. There are not too many vegetarian options, and I wanted a salad entree, so chose the Stetson Chopped Salad. 

The salad is quite beautiful, and avocado (only) could be substituted for the salmon. Lines of the freshest, beautiful arugula, avocado or salmon, Israeli couscous, trail mix, dried corn and diced tomatoes are presented on a plate. Pesto buttermilk dressing is added by your server and the salad tossed. Quite an unusual mix of ingredients creates a delicious salad. Tip: Ask for the recipe afterwards, if you like it, and they will give you a copy.

Next I considered the unusual house made desserts. Alexandra suggested her favorites. I chose the flight of 3 ice creams. From a list of about 12, I chose almond meringue, double chocolate chip and orange blossom. The first two were excellent; the orange a little too subtle. Presentation is of a deconstructed sundae, with candied pecans, cocoa cookie crumbs, puffed kamut treats and the ice creams surrounding a yummy muscavado pizzelle. It was very good, but would suggest perhaps a different presentation. Maybe choose a more popular dessert. 

Should you go? Yes, for the salad. Perhaps choose a lunchtime or when it's less busy, due to the noise. Perhaps it always is busy. The quiet, elegant service makes up for the noise."}
{"text":"I was (and still am) so excited that my favorite restaurant has an outpost at Sky Harbor.  We came to the airport two hours early so that we could check it out.  First of all, five stars for the awesome airport food.  The Stetson Chopped Salad was fantastic.  The truffled mac'n cheese was light on the truffle ... but hell, it's airport food and there was more than enough bacon to get a pass. 

However, I have to dock it two stars for the service.  The hostess couldn't be bothered to get us a table ... actually it did clearly bother her.  Our main server was busy but fine.  The person that brought out our food appeared nearly as annoyed with us for ordering food as the hostess was for our table request.

I don't expect the same quality service at the airport as the Old Town location (which is always great) but I  do expect decent service.  Hell, the McDonald's employees next door were all smiles.  Maybe management should send in a secret eater.  You may be surprised.

So yes, I will be back (as often as possible).  Hopefully I can update this to a five-star."}
{"text":"We went here last night for my birthday since a different restaurant couldn't add 1 more chair to a table. I called for a table for 6 and they were able to get us in right away at 7 pm. I thought that was so awesome! Not being from the area, the hostess was very friendly and gave me walking directions from where we were. Our waiter was very patient and informative as the drink menu was different then most. We had the chopped salad, swordfish and filet. All were outstanding! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I have been to the Downtown location and it was great, but this wasn't.  I would recommend McDonald's(which my daughter ate) over this place.  i had two different waiters(first said hi and disappeared), the second one was really nice, but it took 15 minutes for them to give us a new waiter. I ordered the pork polenta dish, which tasted good, but made me very ill  8-12 hours later.  My Daughter ate a big mac and was fine. not again."}
{"text":"Delays and layovers are a traveler's nightmare! Having 3 hours to kill within an airport, my hubby and I decided to get some lunch and waste some time. We asked a worker at a gift shop what her favorite food spot is in the airport. She immediately directed us to Cowboy Ciao.

Passing this place on our way to our next gate, I saw how packed it was. It looked more like a bar to me, since the bar sits in the middle of the mini-restaurant with giant big screen TVs. They do have lounge seating, which is convenient for small (1-2 people) or semi-large parties (6 people seating). There are also small tables, but it didn't feel cramped to me.

We ordered the Stetson salad, and it was the best salad I've ever tasted! I also recommend their Open Faced Steak Sandwich. It's basically two pieces of filet mignon on top of soft french bread and topped with the most delicious sauce. It's not the type of sandwich you'd imagine. We both shared both meals and it filled us up, so the portion size is pretty decent. 

The price is about average (being a tad bit expensive on their pricier meal menus), but the food is definitely an original and the taste is impeccable! I wish we had this restaurant in Houston!"}
{"text":"Solid food and service.  Our waitress was extremely knowledgeable and helped navigate us through the 'must haves' on the menu.  We 'grazed' a bit and ended up sharing apps for dinner - We started with the Stetson Salad (must have - they even gave us a print out of the recipe), 2 entrees of Scallops (delish), Shrimp and Kale dish (good but forgettable) and ended with the Mushroom Pan Fry (outrageous).  The place gets noisy - decor is ok and nothing to write about but who cares, it's all about the food, right?  The wine list is a bit voluminous and could use some organization.  BONUS - There is a Cowboy Ciao at the Phoenix Airport - in the US Air terminal and offers the same menu as the restaurant."}
{"text":"Mi amor! I see the Stetson Chopped Salad in my dreams, a must-try dish. Fantastic wine and cozy atmosphere make Cowboy Ciao a Scottsdale staple."}
{"text":"frenzy for foodies.  fiend of mine took me there and talked up the Stetson Chopped Salad so much, I thought there was no way our would actually be that good.  It was.  Better yet, it's one of those rare delicious meals that is also very healthy."}
{"text":"Needing a quick meal before the theatre, we drove into Old Scottsdale's winding streets and this one caught our eye because of the curious name and the Yelp! reviews.  Without a reservation at 5:30, we were seated immediately and led to the vacant back of the dining room, which seemed curious, but it gradually filled and we learned was cooler without the sun coming through the windows up front.  We ordered glasses of pinot gris for a cocktail, and both were drawn to the delicious sounding salads.  My wife ordered one of her favorites, chopped salad, which arrived already chopped but our efficient, attentive and friendly waiter Sean mixed it up tableside.  It was a wonderful mixture of smoked salmon, tomatoes, argula, roasted corn, couscous, pumpkin seeds and dressing--delightful.  I was attracted to the Whistle Stop Fried Green Tomato salad, since the film location for the movie is not far from my birthplace and we've been there to eat!  It was also very good and the coating on the tomatoes was different and delicious.  My wife ordered the small plate of (Corn) Nuts about Scallops, three huge sea scallops, crusted with Corn Nuts and seared and served on a bed of heirloom tomato salad and ris-OtT-to (as in over the top risotto with grilled corn, bacon, toasted butternut squash, leeks and Mashengo.)  Some of the tenderest, largest and best-tasting scallops either of us has ever tasted.  I went for the Tiger prawns, five huge shrimp marinated in sweet cilantro and grilled, and served with Tuscan kale/sweet corn salad, creamy cotija dressing, crisp cipollini onions, avocado and pomegranate/clove gastrique.  The shirmp were wonderful,as was the taste of the salad, but I had never had kale raw before and it took a long time and a lot of mastication to make it able to be swallowed.  Perhaps it could be an even tastier dish if the kale were sauteed first.  A very pleasant night out although a little too pricey for regular visits.  2 wines, 2 salads, 2 appetizers = $100 with tip."}
{"text":"We walked in 10 minutes before the kitchen and bar were closing. Being in the industry, we were concerned about ordering so late. We also knew we were running out of time for open kitchens around the area on a Sunday evening so we decided to stay. The bartender thanked us for being conscientious and assured us that it was not a problem. We ordered the truffle mac, korean style short ribs, the burata appetizer and the flat iron steak. Truly, each item was exceptional. Ribs and steak cooked to perfection and were served with fresh vegetables like baby bok choy and spaghetti squash. The burata was high quality and the entire plate was perfectly dressed. The truffle mac exploded with flavor and is a must order. 

Room for improvement would be the quinoa. We love and appreciate that this super food was served as one of our sides, but it was undercooked. This probably has to do with our timing of ordering the food, as they were in the preparations of closing down their kitchen. Broccolini was cooked perfect but seemed to be over salted. 

Overall, we were truly impressed with the service and even more impressed with the quality and presentation of food coming out even though it was their last order. 

Bravo!"}
{"text":"We came here recently for lunch and were excited about the food based on the Uber driver recommendation and the pictures we saw online. The food was definitely solid and we had a good meal but we were not blow away by any of the dishes. Everything was good and there was a nice mix of options on the menu."}
{"text":"I have continuously been disappointed by cowboy ciao. I fly through the Phoenix airport frequently and generally only have time to grab a bite near my gate, forcing me to chose the lesser of two evils, which used to be cowboy ciao. Their food is very overpriced and significantly less than satisfactory. I have dietary restrictions which makes it hard for me to eat most types of meat, for safety, I typically opt for the vegetarian option. I picked up the only salad they offered that had no meat listed in the ingredients, confirmed with the cashier there was no meat, and returned to my seat only to find a layer of bacon underneath the lettuce. When I returned to the restaurant they made no effort to exchange, refund, or apologize. It is clear to me that they have a complete disregard for their customers and have a dangerous attitude towards the quality of their food."}
{"text":"OMG!!!! The food here is sooooooo good!!! The Chopped Salad will make you miss your flight! The service is the BEST I've experienced in awhile!"}
{"text":"Great food and great service. The food was upscale home cooking with a unique take on each plate. Their famous salad was great and my whole table enjoyed everything. Cool atmosphere and great waiter."}
{"text":"I found a parking spot like 200' away! Woohoo! Area around there reminds me of Brooklyn - Shitload of cars and no parking. Bleah, that is so not Kosher! Oh, what? Ohhh right. Yeah, we went there for a Special Occasion (Yeah, my 29 again B-Day beatches!) Since I made reservations we got our table right away. Vine list is INSANE! No, seriously. Its fucking genormous! Not like you want to spend 456 dollars on 1983 Bordeaux, but its there. Together with 27pages of other vine. But you know what? semi-Cute chick who was our waitress did REMEMBERED 3 different \"If not\" vine options we gave her. WOW, i am impressed. And our $21 bottle of some whackyass unusual  vine was really good too.
Food was quite well prepared and good. I personally did not find it super exciting but it surely was good. 
That is it. Its a good joint, especially if you like vine. Go!"}
{"text":"Cowboy Cio.. What a bizarre and lovely little place. If you sit at the bar, you will be greeted with a smile and a handshake by the bartenders. In all of my dining experiences, I've never had multiple bartenders make sure to shake my hand and introduce themselves. This type of warmth was indicative of the experience I had at Cowboy Ciao. 

On to the food:

The 4 piece bruschetta came with 2 pieces topped with diced tomatoes and 2 pieces topped with mushrooms. The tomato bruschetta was zesty with delicious, biting acidity... screaming for a wine pairing. The mushroom bruschetta hinted at something delicious but was the least impressive item I tried this evening. (Although it was the least impressive, it was still yummy).


The scallops, wow. Cork flakes? Coriander? Bacon? Who knows and who cares. This was a very nicely planned and plated dish. I will definitely struggle to order anything else on my next visit. 

Dessert, that I wasn't going to order: oh, Canada peanut butter bar. This was a little slice of heaven. With a creative take on a peanut butter and chocolate dessert, hints of coconut take this to the next level. 

When you're all done, ask the bartender about the speakeasy around the corner. 

Overall, Cowboy Ciao is a must try."}
{"text":"The home of the best salad I've ever had. Fairly creative menu with quality. Everything tasted good. The interior is a little tight and awkward, but nice."}
{"text":"Ambiance needs improvement. The interior decor felt as it was from decades ago. While the location is great, right in Old Town Scottsdale, it is surprisingly old that many other dining options. 

The food was pretty good, especially the mushroom fry. However, it was very rich and had one flavor note so it was hard to finish it. I ended up splitting my entree with another just to have a contrast. The other entree was the brisket sandwich. It was piled with meat, however, I had a few \"fatty\" bites. The side was an oddly sweet cold sweet potato, apple, honey mustard dish. Our service was good."}
{"text":"Shocked at what an awesome experience this was! As I wait for my layover to expire and I can head home, I decided to spend my couple of hours at this bar. Hostesses weren't extremely warm, but the bartenders made up for it. Oh...and the food...the food was actually that good. Frustrated servers couldn't even take away the quality and flavor of the dishes that were served. 
Entrepreneur noted Cowboy Ciao as the best new airport restaurant, and I would venture to say it rivals most standard street restaurants. The Stetson Chopped salad with lemon grilled chicken was surprisingly out of this world! No joke.
Thinking I may need to route all travel through Phoenix so I can visit this eatery."}
{"text":"Had the Lester burger, it came with green chile pulled pork on top of a burger with bacon, cheese and avocado! WOW, the burger was excellent... Have also had their chop salad before too and it was great. Food service was extremely quick too, little pricey, but expected for an airport location."}
{"text":"Best bruschetta! 2 with tomato, 2 with mushrooms, both with cheese :)

Decent drink.

Good fast service.

Prices average."}
{"text":"Make sure to explain to your friends that it's not a chili place.  

Every time I invite someone to check this out they assume its some greasy spoon that serves cowboy beans.  It's actually a upscale semi-formal restaurant and......the food is delicious and intelligent.

I've been here for all three meals.  The brunch is good but the dinner is what really sings.

If you like mushrooms, get off here and get your tail to Cowboy Ciao.  The Mushroom Pan Fry has something like 10 or 11 different types of mushrooms.  I'm not the biggest mushroom fanatic but even I thought it was awesome.

If you've ever read one of my reviews you know I'm all about a good burger.  The Wagyu burger here is freaking phenomenal.  Challah bread AND a truffle aoli AND some amazing bacon..........MY GOD!

Definitely recommended!"}
{"text":"Situated opposite gate B21, Cowboy Ciao was work the hike from terminal C. Restaurants at airports tens to be sub par and expensive. However my experience here was quality food and fairly expensive. 

Firstly the ambience and service was great. My server was super friendly and was able help me through the various tantalizing dishes on display. I finally went with the exotic Mushroom dish, served on double baked Polenta. This dish consisted of 9 different types of mushrooms in a delicious cream sauce.  This entree is rich in flavor and is pretty substantial. 

I struck up a conversation with another traveller who had their signature salad. I had a taste - was refreshingly delicious and if you are looking for something lighter this is definitely a salad worth trying!!

I give it 4 stars ... But the prices are a little on the high side, so I give it 3.8."}
{"text":"Food outstanding. I could eat the Stetson Cobb every night. Korean bbq short ribs were good and very tasty as well.  A bit pricy but this is N Scottsdale. Beer was super cold and the dirty martini was made quite well. Our server was great.  I'll go back for sure but it's a bit of a treat to go there due to the prices."}
{"text":"Amazing. Phoenix always amaze me with many good restaurants. Surprisingly this restaurant is at the airport. next time, this would be my stop for food at phx."}
{"text":"This place is great. We were only here for a short time but I recomend the mac n cheese and then I recommend marrying it becuase its so good!"}
{"text":"Cowboy is awesome!  The Stetson salad like everybody says is the best salad I've ever had.  The staff is great and bartenders know their stuff.  Every time I tell them what I order, I tell them price and they give me a drink, wine, or beer to match it.  I love sitting at the bar watching the chefs work and it really gives you an appreciation for their passion at work.  I don't think I've had a \"meh?\" Dish ever here so if u pick it, it will most likely be amazing."}
{"text":"The ONLY reason why I am giving this 2 stars is because the food was amazing. That was probably the perk of the whole night.

I had a larger party for my birthday, so I had to put my credit card down for the reservation. I had a feeling the whole group wouldn't show up on time, and unfortunately, the didn't, however, everyone arrived within 20 minutes of the reservation. I was the first to arrive, and in the begining the waiter seemed attentive. It was packed, so I was excited. As the night went on, the patrons had trickled out, and I think our waiter checked out....

My last friends that showed up had to wait 30 minutes for the waiter to even come back around to order drinks. At that point, we ordered a round of drinks & some appetisers. It took about 45 minutes for the appetisers to show up, and at that point, we were STARVING, so we ate them up as we ordered our entrees. The apps were really good!

However, this is when we all start losing our patience.... because it took us 2 HOURS to get our entrees!!!!! The waiter went MIA for almost an hour.... We asked the hostess where he was and if we could do something about it, and she had mentioned \"did you talk to a manager?\".....

Isn't us complaining a hostess' cue to get the manager over? Apparently not... because the manager was MIA, too.

I was about 2 minutes away from getting up and leaving, when our entrees came... FINALLY!

Then waited another hour for our check, in which they're not able to split into separate checks... apparently.... and there's no ATMs around the area, either... apparently.... *eyeroll*

My friends had babysitters who they had to over pay because dinners don't typically last 4 hours in a restaurant that's half empty where you pay $40/plate.... on a Thursday.... with a reservation.... 

I have heard nothing but great things about this place, but from this experience, I'd be hard pressed to come back."}
{"text":"Exceptionally awesome airport food. I had the salmon salad during a long layover and loved it. Good wine selection too. Main problem is that it's next to the B gates so unless you're departing from that area, you need to be prepared for a lengthy walk."}
{"text":"Absolute deliciousness!!!! I went here on a date a while back and although I couldn't remember my date's name if you paid me, I can still remember the incredible taste of the stetson chopped salad.... Absolutely to die for!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"You cannot skip Cowboy Ciao when in Scottsdale. The best food and service on old town."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places, if you go you have absolutely get the cobb salad.  Sometimes I go just for that reason alone.  i love this place, the staff is great the food is great and the atmosphere is great.  Can come here for so many reasons, a quiet dinner, a place to begin the night.  JUST GO!!"}
{"text":"The food is still fantastic, but I have to drop a star from Cowboy Ciao after my most recent visit. The group dining experience was not even close to the intimate date I had there a couple months ago. 

I went with a pretty big group this time (nearly 20 people), and the earliest we were able to make a reservation on a Friday night was 8:45. We met for a drink next door, and all arrived at exactly that time, but the wait was still more than 10 minutes. We had to sit at two tables that were perpendicular to each other. It was a big group, so I'm not knocking off any points for that. I am however, pretty disappointed that it was nearly 2.5 hours from the time we showed up to the time we left. 

There was a different server for each table. The one who served at mine was a nice guy, but he and the kitchen felt like they were a little off their game. We ordered a few appetizers and salads with our meals. It felt like forever before those came out. 

The main courses came out pretty quickly after we were done with the apps. The server screwed up, and didn't have the salmon that I ordered. So, now I was left picking at others' meals while waiting for mine. To his credit, he took 100% percent responsibility, and said it was all his fault. I know mistakes happen, especially with big groups, but against his credit with a group our size he's getting an automatic gratuity (20%). I wasn't angry enough to complain, but I can't exactly thank him for leaving someone sitting around while every one else is eating."}
{"text":"A good, but rather expensive, spot to eat at the airport.  Being fans of the Scottsdale restaurant and by convenience of being just feet away from our gate, my wife and I decided to grab a bite at Cowboy Ciao before boarding an overnight redeye from Phoenix to London. 

I love the quesadilla del dia (of the day) concept.  Sure, it's probably the expiring stuff that they need to get rid of, but when folded into a tortilla with melted cheese, who knows any better.  I'm shocked mexican restaurants don't use this idea.  We also had a west coast wrap which was quite tasty.  The chips served with the sandwich were great.

Just a word of warning, Cowboy Ciao is pricey.  With tip and just water to drink, those two orders came to about $29, and they were probably the two cheapest items on the menu.  It's good food, especially for airport dining, but it will cost you."}
{"text":"This place was suggested to my boyfriend and I from someone he works with. I want to give that man a HUGE hug. Cowboy Ciao is fantastic! We started with the Chopped Salad. I can't even put into words the party that was going on in my mouth. It hit every spot on my pallet! For dinner I ordered the Lamb and my boyfriend ordered the mushroom stir fry. Where do I even begin. Everything about the lamb was absolute perfection! I could have easily eaten two or three plates of just the lamb! I tried the mushroom stir fry and I can't even put into words how delicious it is. Of course we had to order dessert at this point so we got the Cotton cheesecake with the frosted flake ice cream. The ice cream was like nothing I have ever eaten. Light but still dense with the cereal in it. Bravo. The cheesecake was stellar. I will be going back and would recommend this place to EVERYONE!"}
{"text":"I'm really surprised this place has four stars. Unfortunately, our experience wasn't anywhere close to deserving even a three star rating. 1. We went for lunch, and it wasn't crowded at all, yet it took 30 plus minutes to get our orders 2. WAY over priced for both the quality and the portions of the food. 3. Ambiance is very mediocre and nothing special. Plus it was very dark in the restaurant- weird for lunch time in my opinion. There are so many great restaurants in the Scottsdale area. Don't make the same mistake we did by going to this one."}
{"text":"Felt like I was walking into a cave. Fortunately I got out with out with only the tiger shrimp appetizer. Could have cooked it better from my frozen food section at home. Waitress was nice, should have saved her boobs for a dudes only table."}
{"text":"FOOD POISONING... I ate here last night and 2 hours later spent the entire night throwing up."}
{"text":"Have had a couple of the best dining experiences in my life here (I only visit AZ every couple years).  Me and the wifey always choose the bar (you can watch the chefs work with the right seat), and the bartenders here are always excellent.  On this visit, the initial recommendations were so good we just asked them to pick the rest of our meal and drinks.  Not only were not disappointed, it was so good I cried on the way back to Camelback knowing it would be another two years before returning.

I have no idea how a restaurant maintains this kind of talent and food over a 6 year period, but they do."}
{"text":"Consistently our fave in Scottsdale, in from Chicago.  Great service, great vibe, love to sit at the bar for a full meal or window table.
Perfect menu for two: 2 Stetson salads, split scallop appetizers (add one more monster scallop for 5$); split app portion of mushroom sauté; Tito with blue cheese olives, 3 good wines by the glass...102$."}
{"text":"Followed the recommendations and ordered the Cowboy Stetson Salad .. for breakfast.  Opted for the avocado (vs salmon).  Unusual and absolutely delicious.  I would definitely order again."}
{"text":"One of the best dinners I've had!  I had the pistachio-crusted salmon, while my date had the puerco lento (slow-cooked pork).  Both were delicious!  Since it was my birthday, we also had the chocolate-peanut butter dessert.  Oh my!  The buffalo carpaccio app was also a hit.

I'd give it five stars, but the noise level here is ridiculous!  The ambience is a little cool and a bit dark for me, but still a nice  place to spend some time at, yet we couldn't hear each other speak.  I really do not find shouting conversations enjoyable."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants of all time.  Heard a sad rumor that they are closing. That would be sad.  Chopped salad was amazing and always have unique one of a kind meals.  Wine selection is also very nice.  Bummed that they are closing."}
{"text":"Love, love, love this restaurant. I came in for dinner multiple times and once for brunch.  The Stetson Salad is a favorite, combined with their braised short ribs.  Nothing to complained about because it's all perfection!"}
{"text":"I once worked on a cattle ranch in Central Arizona. What a god-awful job.
If you're not getting kicked by calves in the branding chute, or rammed by an angry mother cow, you're working sunup to sundown with no relief. That is until supper time. 

Our cook, while rudimentary compared to professional chefs, knew how to cook every type of desert dweller the hands shot daily, but mostly quail and beef. 
Well not since my starry-eyed youth have I tasted a filet sandwich like the one served up at Cowboy Ciao. 
The sandwich will arrive open-faced with a ramequin of brown gravy, a knoll of thin, juicy fries, (more like pomme frites), and a side of slaw. All delectable. 

The filet transcends any level of tender I'm used to, since my version of tender resides squarely between London broil, and skirt steaks.

No gnawing (or gumming) your food here. No siree. 
If you have the time between flights, settle in for a few, have the steak, and imagine what it'd be like to eat beef every day and night for three months.
You'd get so stopped up, you'd probably shit in yer saddle...on roundup...in full view of the senior hand who like to beat you up on Friday nights at the Punkin Center Saloon.

I wish someone would invent a time machine. 
I'd go back and fuck him up. BADLY."}
{"text":"I'm going with 4 stars on this one because I'm torn. My first experience for dinner here a few years ago was terrible. I don't remember what I had and just remember the night being a bit of a blur...quite literally.  Did you know that you can do Vodka flights here?  My recommendation...enjoy the food vs. getting hammered.  Or at least eat your food first...then feel free to get wasted my friends.

But my next trip to this place was AMAZING. Good food, good wine, good company...what more can a girl ask for on a Saturday night? 

So we show up on Saturday night with no rezzies. I was talked into \"shooting from the hip\" and alas how we ended up at a nice place with no reservations on a notorious date night...Saturday. To my pleasant surprise we are sat immediately in at a nice table near the window. After some quick (and quite witty I must say) banter between out waitress and my man-friend over the \"Capon Breast\", our drinks and Stetson salad were brought immediately. 

Oh how I love this salad...so Yummy! For dinner I had the Mushroom Pan Fry and although rich, I did manage to nearly clean my plate...of course after dishing 4 - 5 fork fulls to man-friend. He had the special which was Halibut and it was also delish! I was too full for dessert so my 2nd glass of wine sufficed well. 

My second visit here was amazing and I look forward to going back and trying more the menu. Maybe even some of the more exotic game?"}
{"text":"Cowboy Ciao is the best restaurant in Scottsdale. The food is amazing and their wine list is impressive. This restaurant has the best overall dining experience in town. It can be a bit pricey, but it's worth it. If we're feeling frugal, my friends and I will go in and sit at the bar and drink martini's with blue cheese stuffed olives all nite long if we wanna save a buck and eat at home. Which still isn't cheap. This place is just that amazing."}
{"text":"Food Is always good. Service is good as well. Parking is a challenge. We go for the Stetson chop salad. It is always amazing. We have been going here for year and the always deliver."}
{"text":"The bartender, Jason, was a prick. He wouldn't take our drink order b/c we were sitting on the backside if the bar. When we told him we only wanted to order shots, he said a server would be right with us. The front wasn't full, it's just everyone with their extra carry-ons + leaving 1 seat in between each other, there weren't two seats in a row for us on the front side. The server we eventually got tried to make the excuse that the bartender is busy, but you could tell that he was just an ass. When we only ended up ordering drinks from the bar, it was evident that even the server was perplexed why the bartender didn't jst take our order. Anyway, our server ended up being very friendly and understanding. He saved this experience for us ... other wise this review would have been a 1 Star."}
{"text":"Heard so many good things - what a disappointment. Food was mediocre and service was abysmal. Went for restaurant week which usually is a showcase. I will not be going back."}
{"text":"The food was wonderful and the ambiance surprisingly relaxing for a busy airport restaurant but the real gem was the service. My boyfriend and I had four hours to kill on a layover from Durango, Colorado back to sunny California so we swung in for a couple of beers and some light fare. As always, we chose to sit at the bar and were immediately greeted by a friendly gentleman with a genuine smile and an enthusiastic attitude (but by no means pushy!). Tige was not only attentive and friendly, but he truly made us feel welcome in a sea of unfamiliar faces. Furthermore, (and I should add that I'm also in the service industry), I happened to observe his interactions with other guests and found that he didn't discriminate in his style of service; he was knowledgable and eager to ensure that everyone was comfortable. Tige is truly a man that's proud of his craft. I can't say I'll be back anytime soon as I'm situated in another state, but if I find myself in the desert again I'll be sure to pay him a visit. Cowboy Ciao, you have a top of the line, outstanding bartender on your hands- do whatever it takes to keep him!"}
{"text":"Met my husband for lunch here to have what he says the BEST sandwich ever!  The open face steak sandwich. I had the Stetson chopped salad. Fabulous!!!!!"}
{"text":"The confusingly and creatively named Cowboy Ciao was my side of the compromise candidates for a family visit, as I wanted to try something with more haute with a local flair if we were in the price range anyway. A cautionary note for the iPhone-less masses, Google Maps led us astray while heading here on Scottsdale Road, so familiarity with the area, or at least a map thereof, is a prerequisite to an on-time arrival.

After finding parking far more quickly than the actual restaurant, we entered and were seated in a side room with what can be best termed a western-themed mural with some cowboy representations away from the action of the main room and bar. This was clearly a selective preference that went over well with my parents, but judging by the plural number of people asking to be reseated in the bar area, it is definitely not universal. Otherwise, Cowboy Ciao is relatively minimalist and focuses on the food:

- Pork belly ($12): Pass. Unremarkable.
- Panko-crusted Halibut ($29): Pass. Disappointingly bland and dry. 
- Peanut butter brownie ($10): A stealth cheesecake full of flavor, but the requested substitute of five spice ice cream over the banana bourbon was definitely the highlight.

For perhaps the first time in recorded history, my parents made far better ordering decisions than I did, samples of which made me realize my shameful error:

- (Mini) Exotic Mushroom Pan Fry ($14): Signature dish for a reason. I could easily leave the polenta, but the varieties of mushrooms themselves in the complementing sauce I'd only like to leave in my stomach.
- Pork shank (~$28): Soft, juicy, and very well-matched with the cranberry walnut sauce more appropriately called a curry than a chutney. 
- Short ribs (~$28): The meat itself was solidly tender, but the real attraction was the dried cherry barbecue sauce, so much so that I wished I could have eschewed the high-end proteins and just gotten it with a plate of sliced pork.

Based on our experience and having heard what I did about the \"Stetson chopped\" I would certainly return for a visit where I hopefully will choose more wisely, lest I further disappoint myself and any dependent companions."}
{"text":"Apparently the manager is a human body expert on when food poisoning kicks in for anyone and everyone because he told me no way could I have been sick from that restaurant. I'm pretty confident that I got food poisoning from here. For the manager to blatantly disregard it could \"never happen\" at his restaurant is a naive statement. Restaurants aren't all perfect. Sometimes things happen. I love this place. I do. And I wasn't going to write this but after speaking with the manager I feel the need to share. Sir, your place of establishment is the ONLY food I consumed in the last 16+ hours. This isn't me making some statement to be rude. It's your brush off that your establishment could never have an incident leading to food poisoning."}
{"text":"Nice little upscale place in Scottsdale. We split the mac and cheese, which was awesome, and we both had the espresso rubbed filet. The service was exceptional. I ordered a glass of Shiraz that didn't agree with me. Our server promptly swapped it out for a zin that was very good. I definitely recommend the place!"}
{"text":"In the mood to give a place at the airport 4 stars.  Stopped in to grab breakfast before a morning flight.  Started with some coffee of course, and ordered up the Chocolate Chip Pancakes, because I might as well board my flight and go right into a food coma.  The pancakes were nice and fluffy, with syrup...and some warm peanut butter to spread on them as well.   Mmmmm, carby, sugary goodness!  Filling for sure.  Not a bad place to grab breakfast before heading home."}
{"text":"Not sure where the \"cowboy\" in the name comes through in the restaurant or the food but I was very pleased with the food! Especially for airport dining. The chicken and waffles and biscuits and gravy were some of the best I've ever had. Our waiter was very friendly and personable too."}
{"text":"If you have a chance to dine here, make sure you order the chopped salad! It was amazing - the ingredients, the dressing, the presentation - definitely worth ordering to start the meal. As we were finishing up our salad, our entrees came which did not disappoint. Overall a great meal with great service."}
{"text":"Tried the Restaurant Week special, and chose the Stetson chopped salad, mixed mushrooms with polenta, and bread pudding.  The Stetson chopped was amazing.  The preparation is beautiful when they bring it out, and then the taste is the perfect mix of sweet, savory, crunchy, soft once the salad is mixed up.  I tried some of the testosterone salad, which was decent, and filled with a lot of well prepared beef, but it didn't quite compare to the chopped salad.  

Just as a general side note, if you choose the restaurant week menu and have the chopped salad and then the mushrooms, I think the flavor of the chopped salad is more bold than the mushrooms, so the mushrooms will taste bland to you.  This happened to me as I transitioned from the salad to main dish, but when I took the mushrooms home in a to go box and ate them later, the more delicate flavor showed through and I appreciated it a lot more.  

The bread pudding was amazing.  Perfectly moist, with lots of flavor, and not too sweet.  

Service was excellent (Thanks Owen!), and along with the extensive selection of wines, they also have some more unique beers such as lambic, as well as a nice selection of non alcoholic sodas (The cream soda is locally made and very tasty!)"}
{"text":"Just Awful!!!  Loud, cramped, the worst service ever....We ate here last year and enjoyed our dining experience, this year the experience was so bad we won't go back.  We 'had' a reservation, waited 10-15 min for the server to even greet us.  We were sat about a foot away from a table of 8 LOUD men.  That should have been the first clue. We planned on a quick meal and yet after an hour still didn't have our main entree. We watched as the table of 8 had appetizers, bottles of wine and their full meal...still waiting.  Way TOO many people in a cramped space that they really cannot accommodate on a proper service level.  
Chopped salad , Eh, who cares when you have to wait a full hour and a half for 'Raw' over priced scallops...the server NEVER returned to see how we liked our meal so I ate a bit of my husbands 'Overcooked' Salmon. She did remove the meal as if it happens all the time.  
Big regret...we should have gone to Hula's or The Mission.  Ciao 'Cowboy Ciao' , so disappointed we gave you our precious one night out.  You can have all the conventioneers."}
{"text":"Our server was even better than our food. Keena was fast, knowledgeable and efficient for our party of 10. We had been traveling for awhile and she made dinner great. Our food and her wine recommendations were perfect."}
{"text":"This place is a joke!  The owner owes millions to the federal government and was seemingly inebriated! !!  Apparently it's quite the reputation for that! Most of the reviews your rating, ARE OUTDATED!!!!!
HUGE WASTE OF MONEY! #!!"}
{"text":"We are in town visiting old folks so love to get away and enjoy some Scottsdale/western schtick once in awhile. So it was fun to go to old downtown, wander around and eat and drink. We showed up early without a res and got a great table for four. The server was knowledgable and enthusiastic about the food and menu. He was right, everything was great and we feel we had, for us, a gourmet meal. They have fun, specialty drinks from the bar and the menu is eclectic. Glad to see a legend is living up to the reputation."}
{"text":"The food was decent for airport food, but I don't think it's better than any other options in terminal 4. The chicken didn't have much flavor and all the spread was concentrated in the bottom of the wrap. The chips tasted fresh but were very greasy and soggy.  The wrap and chips combo cost me $14 and left me wishing I'd just gone to Le Madeleine for a sandwich ($6.99)...even with chips AND a drink it wouldn't have cost $14, and I would have felt I got my money's worth. Based on the great reviews, maybe their hot food options are better than their to-go items."}
{"text":"Maybe I got my hopes up with all the hype of this place but I wasn't impressed with Cowboy Ciao. The only thing my husband and I liked was the Stetson salad which we had a very similar version of at Citizen Public House, the night before.

The entrees were just meh. I got the mushroom dish and my husband got the wild boar chop - both pretty overpriced and bland. The customer service was poor. Our waitress didn't seem to care very much for us and at times, seemed annoyed by us. She would say a bunch of personal things like this is my favorite and you have to get this and that, but it wasn't believable and it was at times, hard to take. 

The decor was nice and it was nice to see/read about the history of the Stetson salad and the restaurant. I can see how it put Scottsdale on the map in terms of its food culture but nevertheless, it wasn't a very good meal."}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant for a foodie! The dishes we tried were absolutely delicious! Their chopped salad is a must! The best salad I tried so far! Seriously! Fried trout-sultry, lots of flavor and another must! Mushroom dish- takes you to another level in the mushroom world! And don't get me started on their wine list! Pages and pages of great selection of wines starting with sparkling! Perfect choice for a pescatarian and wine lover. Will go back to try other dishes!"}
{"text":"$19 for an over-cooked and virtually tasteless burger. The menu describes it as some type of exotic beef. I've had far better for $7.00 at Alphys in Arroyo Grande. Might have been better if the waitress - Monique - had actually cared. When I pointed it out, she huffed and said, \"what would you like me to do, take it back?\"

Can't remember the last time I left a ZERO tip. Poor food is not the fault of the server. In this case the food was only exceeded in its poor quality by the server's attitude. 

And to continue the rant - it takes a ton of attitude for a restaurant to think its food is so tasty that they don't need to put salt & pepper shakers on the table. The chef at Cowboy Ciao must think his poop doesn't smell - but he's wrong.

I travel for business 10-15 days a month - eat in airports nearly every day I'm on the road. Cowboy Ciao is right up at the top of my worst experience list."}
{"text":"Wow. I just came from the South and the biscuits and gravy here is better than what I had down there!  The gravy was fab boo, so rich and flavorful vs white paste. And the bloody Mary's are nicely spiced.  Heavy on the meat here, just note."}
{"text":"Hello Cowboy, I like you-wink wink-

First things first, make sure you get a reservation. This place is hopping, and although they have bar seating available, it's nicer to experience this meal as a sit down.  Located in downtown Scottsdale, this joint serves up comfort food done right.  

We ordered the following FOOD: 

Tiger Prawns ............................. $14 grilled and served atop green chile elote
(roasted sweet corn & Anaheim chiles, hominy, cotija aïoli) with cilantro and lime.
*****This Hominy concoction was unique and good.  I would almost like this served over a salad, but that's just me. 

Exotic Mushroom Pan Fry $25 ........................................  A shit ton of mushrooms in ancho cream over double-cooked polenta, all topped with grilled portabello, avocado, Roma tomato and cotija cheese.
****This is easily shareable by a party of 3!  RICH, yummy, and paired with a good glass of wine.  GET IT. 

the Stetson Chopped ......... 13  (look at the web page for pics, but TRUST that it's good)

As far as ridiculous goes,  the mushroom was my favorite. I understand why people want to bathe in that creamy sauce.  SOO good, and like nothing I have ever sampled.   

Too full for dessert, but gladly would come back.  Service probably would have been better IF we had a reservation, but I get it.  The nice friendly bartenders were the highlight of the evening.  Make sure you tip them!"}
{"text":"Had the Truffle Mac & Cheese because that's quick.  It came in a small bowl, just the right portion.  It's topped with some potato chip crumbs which was rather odd tasting.  The Mac itself was so watery that it was worse than Kraft.  One star is being generous."}
{"text":"Best food in Scottsdale and worst service. Just finished dinner here. Waitress took drink and appetizer order then stood at our table till we ordered our entries. Never cleared our appetizer plates and cocktail glasses until main course came. They brought main course without a steak knife for my husbands dinner. She said she would bring it then served two tables drinks while our food got cold. We had to stop her for water and a glass of wine to go with our main dish. She cleared one finished plate and left the rest until her next pass by. Never asked us how our meal was. The people at the table behind us got up and left. Hopefully they hire better servers."}
{"text":"Three stars only for the chopped salad. Used to be one of my favorite places to eat in Scottsdale, but they are always taking the best items off the menu! I was so disappointed when I  found out they took the bison meatloaf off the menu . I wont be going back."}
{"text":"Started my meal with the Stetson chopped salad. Absolutely brilliant, wish I would have thought of it myself. A memorable presentation and a must order. 

Next came the duck con fit relleno. A valiant effort but the mallard was too overpowered by the pepper and batter. 

For the main course I selected the exotic mushroom pan fry.  Beautiful variety of mushrooms, swimming in a savory gravy that mimics the loveliest Yankee roast that you've ever had. A meatless Friday would never be easier.

 A fun, eclectic, Scottsdale eatery."}
{"text":"Stopped in for some grub before our flight. Nice upscale menu options. Great bar selections, loved that the Mexican Mule has 2 kinds. Had the open-faced steak sandwich, which was pretty good. The serving size was just right. It's a bit pricey but I'm happy to find a restaurant that serves quality food in the airport."}
{"text":"I had a chopped salad, and it was one of the best salads I've every had - inside OR outside of an airport.  A wonderful surprise, and since I travel through PHX often I was excited to find this little gem!"}
{"text":"Great food, great location/ setting, and good drinks. Been here twice both were great experiences. As far as the food I highly recommend the following:

App's-  truffle oil mac & cheese and the mini mushroom pan yummy

Dinner- It was so good that it's the only thing I've ordered and don't want to try anything else just too goo. 

Korean-Style BBQ Short Ribs they are AMAZINGGGGG they are so tender and juice fall right off of bone and they are served with this mouth watering Asian BBQ sauce. It's not a thick BBQ sauce put rather a thin more like ajus sauce. 

The place is pricey but worth it."}
{"text":"Late evening, limited menu, and it was very busy. Server seemed new or overwhelmed - brought my dirty martini out with a lime slice (ha!) but was friendly and quickly corrected. I ordered a chopped salad w/avocado as the protein (neat!) - interesting chopped - arugula, pumpkin seeds, craisins, dried corn, pico de gallo, and couscous. Loved the dried corn (nice texture) and pumpkin seeds, pesto buttermilk ranch dressing rocked, wish there was a lot more arugula (barely any greens in this salad), and thought the pico had a funky taste so didn't eat.

Feel like this could be a great restaurant if not in the airport and I wasn't there so late. Really wanted to try the Exotic Mushroom Pan Fry. Would def try a non-airport location."}
{"text":"I went here on a Saturday night with a group of 8. I ordered the filet mignon and it was the most tasteless piece of meat I've ever had. I almost couldnt believe how little flavor there was, only to be occasionally overpowered with an unappealing blast of pepper. Super disappointing for a $38 steak. Also, it was very busy, but that's not an excuse for your waiter to only check in once every 35 minutes. Finally, we were told that we couldn't split our checks between our 4 couples. Any respectable POS system can do that and it was a huge inconvenience since one couple ordered significantly less. The only saving grace was that the chopped salad was delicious. I will most likely never go back."}
{"text":"I went to Cowboy Ciao for lunch with co-workers. The restaurant itself is setup pretty nice with good atmosphere and seating. The staff was great and very attentive and our waiter was incredibly nice and described their food and processes. Top notch. I got the open faced steak sandwich with bleu cheese chips and the mixed green salad with tomato vinaigrette. The salad was amazing, the combination of the dressing with the seed mix and salad ingredients was great nice and fresh. The sandwich was good, I thought it lacked in overall flavor especially in the meat but I liked the crunchy onions and the toast. The chips were nice and crunchy, I personally find bleu cheese overpowering so I could only eat half of them but if you enjoy it then you would probably love these. Overall an OK place to eat but for a sandwich chips and salad $30 is expensive."}
{"text":"Recommended by friends yes very nice upscale restaurant. I had the Stetson chopped salad Valerie had the corn nut scallops both dishes very delicious.  Portions appropriate for a light lunch healthy diet. Decor enjoyable. Seating comfortable. The upscale shopping district setting also offers some good people watching. Which included a Ferrari, a Lamborghini and a host of Benz, Bmw and others"}
{"text":"Bathrooms are really sub-par. Nasty sink, broken faucet for hot water (push or pull it turns water on) and the bright, fluorescent-lit men's room opens right up to several tables."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for our anniversary, and we were absolutely delighted.  (Just reading the menu is fun) start with dessert, each item is one of a kind."}
{"text":"Stetson Chopped Salad. Enough Said."}
{"text":"I have eaten here a few times and have had amazing food and good service. This has been my wife and I place for dinner over the past couple of years. The food, is fantastic and the service is great."}
{"text":"I love this place. My husband and I decided to stop by for a quick lunch while browsing in Scottsdale. We shared the duck relleno and the stetson salad and both were wonderful and very tasty. The waiter was friendly and super helpful with food selection."}
{"text":"Our group of 6 went here after having good experiences in the past. The hostess was rude and impatient, and our server was inept. Our menus were thrown down on the table as we were being seated and we had to ask for the wine list three times before we finally got it. The manager said they just don't put out the wine list at lunch, so they aren't used to it. Bad answer and poor recovery. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Been here many times and have never been disappointed.  Had lunch today with wife and daughter. I had the duck confit enchiladas,  my wife had the open-face steak sandwich and my daughter had the ahi tuna sandwich. I hesitate to tell you how good the enchiladas were because the last time i was there they had ran out of them. Suffice it to say there's a reason they run out of them, simply incredible. I'd like to tell you how good the steak sandwich was but my wife ate it all before i had a chance to try it and she's usually a very slow eater.  Oh well, she said it was delicious. My daughter's tuna was very good but the sauce tended to be a little heavy and a little too hot for the fish. Hey, had to complain about something, otherwise id never get a table."}
{"text":"This is a tough review for me to right, as I have eaten here a number of times and have had amazing food and very good service. This has been a 4 or 5 star, go to place for me over the past few years. My wife and another couple decided to visit Cowboy Ciao for restaurant week. The food, as it always has been was fantastic. The service, however, was not up to the level we have come to expect. The waitress who served us seemed to be very unhappy with the whole restaurant week concept. 
With a wine list of over 1800 wines, we asked for assistance from our server. She asked what varietal we were looking for and we answered Zinfandel. She looked at us as if we did not belong in her restaurant and responded with we do NOT have white zinfendal. We clarified that we know the difference between zinfendal and white zin. She asked what price range we were looking at and we said under $60 a bottle. After a fairly long delay, she came back with 3 options, 1 at $58, 1 at $75, and 1 at $80. We immediately disregarded her options and made a choice ourselves. 
Again, the food was as good as it always is, but the server acted as though she will be very happy when restaurant week is over."}
{"text":"Loved the mushroom pan fry, really a unique dish. Very rich, maybe order the half portion and try something else. The famous chopped salad lives up to the hype, try it. The ahi tuna is not paired correctly with the sides. Overall, very pleasant dining experience."}
{"text":"My office is across the street and I had my first dinner there a few weeks ago.  Culinary wizardry! Wild Boar meatball appetizer is nor to be missed. Flatiron steak with what tempura-like plantains (bananas) on the side was awesome."}
{"text":"the food here was great. i'm glad we just got a few of the smaller items. chopped salad = great! the ingredients sound weird but just taste so good together.

this place completely fails for me due to the service: the server was not attentive nor was he gracious. he was knowledgeable but quite aloof. he wasn't engaging nor was he entertaining. very just ok.

however, i cannot express my hate towards the bartender enough. we literally waited at the bar for over 10 minutes waving her down. she looked a few times and rolled her eyes, clearly assisting the people in front who were ordering lots of wine where she would make more money. 

are you kidding me? we should have just walked out. i don't know why we didn't.

i cannot honestly recommend this place."}
{"text":"So, my mom's birthday was Sunday....she chose to go to Cowboy Ciao...me....I am a picky picky eater...so I immediately went and hit the website checking out their menu....I was concerned at first....wild boar meatballs....buffalo....i am not a meat eater to say the least....However once we arrived I was pleasantly surprised!!! We ordered the \"crispy mac n cheese\"..its like an explosion of taste in your mouth...the Stetson Chopped...FANTASTICALLY ORGASMIC....My parents love Malbec wines, they had a stellar selection of wine and Malbecs...And our server was phenomenal!!! She gets 5 STARS!!

The only down..was the creepy guy(he was young wanna be cool manager or assistant) who managed to make US and the server uncomfy when he rudely came up asking if she ID'd my brother...which he literally watched her do from across the room...then he 3rd degree'd him on his age....Seriously...And he didn't do that when my sister who is obviously barely 21 (she looks like she is 16) ordered drinks....I get that it's Scottsdale and your all fruit loops but come on. Try not to ruin my moms birthday dinner...

Other than that weirdness.....the food was amazing, the desserts were amazing, the ice creams we were worried about due to the names...but the american oak and brown butter were mouth watering!!! I would 5 Star this place but that guy kinda killed it for me...."}
{"text":"Chopped salad is surprisingly amazing. Mac and cheese was delicious. Service was fast. Definitely recommend! Tiger prawns were amazing too"}
{"text":"So I've been visiting for a couple days and. Was excited to try all that Scottsdale has to offer. But wow, I love the \"cowboy ciao\" chopped salad. As you see, it's already been written many times! Dried crunchy sweet corn , Israeli cous cous, arugula, smoked salmon, pepitas, pumpkin seeds, dried currants, bruschetta and tossed in a pesto Caesar like dressing!! Wha wha?? Hashtag genius!

The service was really good and our waiter is very very nice."}
{"text":"Went for restaurant week, first the menu online shows that they offer the exotic mushroom pan fry as one of the options. We find out after getting there that it costs an extra $10 for it. The dessert was cold and after asking that the waiter warm it up, he brought out a new plate of the same desert and it was still cold. Poor service, food really was sub-par for what we paid. There's plenty of great restaurants in this area, I'd try somewhere else."}
{"text":"I stopped in for a beer and bite before my flight. I was disappointed in the service I received- bartender took orders from people on either side of me before even acknowledging I was there even though they were seated about 5 minutes after myself. I was bummed to learn that not only one but two beers I tried to order were out. I finally ended up ordering a Sam Adams..  I had a mixed green salad to eat- nothing fancy. It was a normal salad. Next time I'm flying out of PHX I won't be stopping here."}
{"text":"This is one of my old Scottsdale standbys.  The mushroom dish is great, the wine list expansive, and the food consistently good.  My only concern is that the last few visits have revealed that the menu is rather static.  We have always had a good experience here, but Cowboy Ciao was initially known as a refreshing alternative to the expensive yet mediocre restaurants that otherwise plague Scottsdale.  I hope they get back to that someday."}
{"text":"Lester's Bonanza Burger was very good, but should have been better for $19!

cornbread bread pudding was all sugary sweet and no spectacular flavor, which is what I expect at $10. It came with average tasting ice cream."}
{"text":"So if there as any airport pretty much in the world I would least rather stick at it be PHX. Stumbled upon this spot when we missed our connection and I got to say I was blown away. Amazing service attentive genuine not your typical I hate my life experience. Had the salmon which was stellar. Highly recommend. Great quality and great service."}
{"text":"Had the chopped salad and it was a refreshing healthy twist and loved the atmosphere for being inside an airport :-)"}
{"text":"We have lived in Scottsdale for almost 5 years and many times we have heard how great this place is.  Finally went here to try it out with a group and it was probably some of the worst food we have had in Scottsdale.  The service was not great and seriously the food is lacking!  We won't be back..."}
{"text":"Get the salad get the salad get the salad get the salad get the salad get the salad get the salad get the salad get the salad get the salad get the salad get the salad get the salad get the salad get the salad get the salad get the salad get the salad get the salad get the salad get the salad.

For the love of all things good in the world... 

Get. The. Damn. Salad.

Service is great."}
{"text":"Yum!! Best chopped salad ever. Great small plate options, that change pretty frequently. Large plates are great as well, however lots of meat options. The scallop and risotto small plate was my favorite. The scallops were huge and fresh. Ambiance was nice, dimly lit. Seems to be pretty busy every time I have dined there...which is always a good sign. Super cool drink options, definitely enjoyed taste testing that menu."}
{"text":"Amazing food great place!  Institution in old town,  and they continue to deliver been here several times and it's always been fantastic"}
{"text":"Steak salad is alright... Stupid name... Great wine selection, if you have time and are not alone, and can order the entire bottle... Better beer selection would make me want to spend more time here"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I chose Cowboy Ciao as the setting to take our parents who were meeting each other for the first time. Coincidentally, it was also our first time dining here, and boy, was it nothing short of phenomenal! What an amazing experience. Sure, the restaurant is a little old, but at night, the place is dark with candles surrounding the area. Such a romantic place, perfect for a date, and in our case, a meeting. What we really loved is that there was no music playing, so it was perfect for conversation amidst some incredible wine. If you were interested in buying a bottle, be sure to check online before you go in to dine here. They have over 2,000 wines, and it is pretty difficult to navigate once you are actually there. Anyway, amazing wine program, our server was wonderful, the food was to die for, and we will definitely be back. I'll be craving that mushroom pan fry for the rest of my life!"}
{"text":"I just moved to Scottsdale and ate dinner here...AMAZING!  Service was great and food was even better.  But be warned, portions are huge!  I ordered an appetizer and the mini version of the mushroom fry, and it was more than enough food.  My mom had the Stetson chopped salad, which we both swooned over.  Oh, and we shared the sweet potato soup, and, had I not been in public, I would've licked the bowl clean.  I'll definitely be returning soon!"}
{"text":"Came here because we heard good things about their airport location (Sky Harbor). We figured if the food at the airport is good, then this place must be even better. We were not disappointed. We made a reservation on Open Table, our table was ready upon arrival. Our waitress was professional and polite. We asked if we could substitute our starches for vegetables and they were happy to do so. I ordered the Filet Mignon with a bed of vegetables. The filet was cooked perfectly as ordered. It was juicy on the center and tender, very good cut of meat. 

My only complaint is we came here for a birthday celebration; which we noted on open table, but were charged for the slice of cake. I do not expect free stuff but typically a slice of cake or muffin is complimentary at most restaurants, when it's your birthday of course."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch to try their original chopped salad.  Was not disappointed with the service or the salad.  They even mix it up for you as an extra bonus when they bring it to your table.  I also tried their truffle Mac & Cheese.  I'm drooling as I type this because it was that good.  The kind of good that makes you want to lick the bowl.  Come here during lunch to avoid the dinner crowd.  Then you can enjoy walking around the canal.  Nothing beats the AZ weather during the fall."}
{"text":"Going on other reviews of this restaurant, I went with the burritos. They are tasty, in a unique way that I can't put my finger on. The fact that they cook it to order is really nice, instead of most airport food that seems fresh from the freezer."}
{"text":"The food here was some of the best I've had, not just in an airport, but just in general. My boyfriend and I had brunch here before our flight out and we were more than happy with the taste, quality and service of our entire experience."}
{"text":"I feel like I'm breaking up with someone by doing this but, wow, it's not me its you :( 

Digestif, I love you... But you can tell your ugly step sister Cowboy Ciao to never call me again.   

My tongue is still smoking... in a bad way."}
{"text":"Stopped here for a late lunch before catching a flight. I love this place! It's eclectic, they play cool music and the servers/bartenders really take good care of you. 

I ordered the Upper Manhattan for a cocktail - which was made perfectly. I also tried the Testosterone Salad and it was amazing. Grilled beef tenderloin with leafy greens, huge raisins and Maytag blue cheese. It doesn't get any better than this. The meat was cooked perfectly and all the flavors really came together. For a first time visit, this salad really hit it out of the park for me. 

They have a really nice wine selection here, and the range of food to choose from will make any foodie happy. The atmosphere here is also different. I can't put my finger on it - but the bartenders keep the customers entertained and everyone seems to really have a good time here. 

I will definitely stop here again next time i'm passing through terminal 4. Given the typical lousy airport food options most travelers are used to, you need to give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Guess they don't realize this an airport. We don't have time for extremely slow service."}
{"text":"I'll admit that I was stockpiling snarky comments before I was even in the front door. Cowboy Ciao? Oh. Ciao...Chow. A quick look at the menu showed that the place has a sense of humor and loves to combine ingredients that should not be combined. Bacon chocolate chip cookies? Do they go well with the special Kangaroo loin chops? I'll never know because I passed on both. Is deloining a kangaroo even legal??

All that aside, what a great place. A wonderful and reasonably priced encyclopedic wine list including great wines by the glass. I had a glass of an Italian wine that was $6 a glass and phenomenal. The food was great. Get the chopped salad for a starter to share.

Service was particularly friendly and attentive. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Cowboy Ciao.  What a sickeningly cute name.  Now I wish I had more to yelp about with you than a quickie business dinner with my boss, but that's all I've got.  Still, I'm gonna review it because I doubt I'll be back.  No, no, don't read that as a criticism; given the opportunity, I'd gladly return.  However, since I so infrequently make it to Phoenix (as in \"never\"), I doubt I'll be back.

Nevertheless, I was happy with my brief interlude.  We didn't have reservations, but would've been happy eating at the bar.  However, in a strange twist only a weekday night would bring, the bar was full, but they had plenty of tables.  Table it is!  I ordered the mini-mushroom mix and the porkbelly sliders.  It was all very, very good.  In fact, I wanted very much to have more than the two sliders they served, but in retrospect, that's probably a good amount of fried up pig for most people.  Though the mushroom mix gets more hype, the pork won the night.

Service was friendly and competent, even though we didn't stick around long enough to really enjoy it.  But they called a cab for us, the cab arrived quickly and we headed back to the hotel.  In all, four solid stars.  Had we stayed longer or I had another crack at you guys, I'm sure five stars wouldn't be too far off.  

BTW, thanks to ex-Phoenician, current Yelper Robert M. for pointing me in this direction."}
{"text":"The BEST customer service I have ever had. These guys are awesome I was so impressed as a bartender you appreciate customer service I recommend everybody to  check these two fellas out! The ultimate bartender service you will get"}
{"text":"This was our second time at Cowboy Ciao.  When we were visiting here last year, we loved it then, too.  Last year, I had the mushroom entrée and told the server how I was conflicted between having that again and having the lamb sirloin this time.  I ordered the lamb and was not disappointed in the least.  Glad I did that.  Because I had raved about the mushrooms, the server brought me a complimentary side of them.  My wife had the short ribs again, and they were just as delicious as last time.  The wine list is incredibly extensive and, interestingly, arranged primarily by price, which is a nice touch.  You can decide on a price point, then peruse an extensive variety of sparkling, white, and reds within that price point.  The service, as last time, was impeccable.  Cowboy Ciao has become one of our go-to restaurants while visiting Scottsdale.  I would recommend it to anyone, anytime."}
{"text":"Best airport food I've ever had. Chopped salad was unique and yummy. Booth was comfy and semi-quiet for an airport. More airports should step it up a bit like Pheonix did!"}
{"text":"Ryan took amazing care of us. He was thoroughly prepped on Gluten free/Celiac issues including salad dressing options. I ordered the Stenson Chopped salad. It had corn, a Nut and dried fruit medley, grilled chicken, arugula chopped, and tomato salsa. Followed up with a balsamic dressing. I am SO thankful for the help as I looked over the menu and couldn't find anything to eat but he was amazing at modifications. PS. Request Ryan"}
{"text":"It's no wonder they are famous for their chopped salad... it is friggin amazing! I won't go into details because everyone else already has... but trust me... you will experience hardcore food envy if you pass on ordering this salad any someone in your party eats it in front of you. 

Have been here a few times, it can be a bit pricy, but the food is consistently good and the service is typically very good too. Great spot for a date-night. 

I like to split the chopped salad as a starter and split an entrée. Last time I was there my bf and I split the salad and the 'Cure for the Common Salmon' - great for sharing and served with orzo/arugula salad with avocado, cherry tomatoes, shallots, and corn. Yum!  Only downside is the restaurant can get very loud and I wish they had outdoor seating."}
{"text":"We had a three hour layover in Phoenix and since we were sick of the typical airport food we had at our previous stops, we looked around for something a little nicer.  We got seated right away and the staff was super friendly.  We both had the sangria and shared some sort of mushroom dinner as well as the pulled pork.  The meals were amazing and I was still in shock that we were eating this well in an airport.  The food came really fast and it was an overall great experience.  If I ever happen to stop in Phoenix again I would for sure go back."}
{"text":"I feel like Sean M (review on here) in that I was expecting an amazing experience here but was underwhelmed. The stetson salad was excellent and if I ever go back I would definitely order it again. We ate every last bit and wished there was more. The wine flight I ordered was also great and the wine menu is beyond extensive. After that, though I was disappointed. I ordered the special mushroom dish and was wondering what everyone was raving about. It was missing most of the types of mushrooms that the menu said would be in it and consisted of mostly baby portabellas and portabellas smothered in sauce with cheese. I could have made it at home and it was way overpriced for what it was. For dessert I ordered bread pudding which I thought would redeem the dinner. It was good but nothing memorable. Definitely not the outstanding food I was expecting based on many reviews here. Our waitress was great.  If I were in the area I would go again for the wine flight and maybe order an appetizer from the bar but I think the hype exceeds the food."}
{"text":"Layover for two hours and thought I'd re the cowboy ciao. Major yum! Had a glass of very good wine (very short but complete wine list) and the burratta salad. I liked the salad so much I ordered a second helping."}
{"text":"Loved loved loved the chop salad!  Hubby got the breakfast enchiladas and was very happy with them as well!  Would highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"It is okay, let's not get too overwhelmed. I realize this is Scottsdale, where Del Taco is inventive, and one may not be sure if it truly is a restaurant if the Fox Group doesn't own it. I think its hype surpasses the quality. I recommend this place, it just doesn't overwhelm me and beg me to come back. In fact, nothing I ate there was that memorable."}
{"text":"Unbelievable. During a long layover in the airport we stopped by to eat here. It was me, my wife and our 6 month old baby who was asleep in our small pop-up stroller. The restaurant only had a couple of tables occupied and I'd guess about 90% empty at this time. The employee came up to the front and we asked to be seated. She proceeded to tell us that it was a safety hazard to have a stroller in the restaurant and that we could be seated by the rail and we would have to leave our sleeping baby in the stroller in the terminal hallway just outside of the restaurant. Clearly I was in shock at this request. This was our baby's first flight and he just fell asleep after having troubles popping his ears during the flight. Clearly I am not going to leave him anywhere but next to us. I proceeded to tell her we would find food elsewhere. I will NEVER eat here. Thank you to a very busy \"Matt's Big Breakfast\" restaurant across the airport who had no problem seating me and my family with the stroller."}
{"text":"The service at this place was horrible as was the host who seated us.  However, the food was amazing.  I had the Sesame Noodle Salad with chicken and it was flavored perfectly.  The chicken was breaded perfectly and cooked equally as well.  Would go back only for the food itself."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here with his parents Saturday.  We arrived at 5:45 for a 6:00 dinner reservation.  The restaurant was half empty when we placed our order.  It took 55 minutes and two requests to our waitress to get our first course.  It took another 30 for our main.  I complained to the waitress and the general manager.  Both were unapologetic stating there was nothing they could do as it was the first night of restaurant week.  Restaurant week means a trimmed down menu and I assume is meant to attract new customers.  There are too many other great restaurants in the area to give Cowboy Ciao a second chance with such an unapologetic attitude."}
{"text":"The salad held true to what everyone said.  It was amazing.  I also had the mushroom and polenta dish which was excellent as well.   Overwhelmingly large wine selection."}
{"text":"Started off with yummy cocktails.   Both had interesting ingredients, very herby.  For lunch Mr B. enjoyed his Ruben sandwich with potato chips.   It was a very large portion,  we could have split it. 

I ordered the steak sandwich, as I had been craving a steak all week.   When it arrived I was immediately disappointed in the size of the steak.  Two half dollar size medallions on a piece of french bread.   Like the old Burger King commercial stated,  \"where's the beef?!\"  There was a large portion of potato chips topped with gorgonzola , but the meat was almost non-existent.  I think at an $18 price point,  a larger piece of meat could be spared. 

The manager happened to be making his rounds, so I told him of my plight.   He was very nice about it,  offered to get me more steak,  which I declined.   Interestingly he said the steak is weighed at 5oz.  Doubtful that was even close to 5oz.  Who ate my steak?!

The manager sent over a nice dessert  which was very thoughtful, and we were appreciative.   

Our waiter was a polite gentleman and the ambiance is cool.   I'd come back again for drinks, but I'd stay away from the paltry streak."}
{"text":"Chopped salad was small for the price and lacked flavor, service was slow, and the menu was all over the place. The atmosphere is also cold and uninviting. We came here for lunch, so maybe dinner is better, but there are too many incredible places to eat in old town Scottsdale to waste your time and money on this one."}
{"text":"If I had to eat a salad everyday, the Stetson Chopped (classic, with smoked salmon) with avocado added would be my salad of choice."}
{"text":"I walked up to go counter since I had 20 mins to board plane- I asked about how long to get wrap- they said 8 mins- I just got in from NYC off a plane they only had snacks on- so I'm starving- 

15 mins later- they kept saying 30 seconds- 30 seconds- right till last minute I had to leave because my gate was about to close- needless to say they lied and kept my money/ when I could've went next door and grabbed a soup. Thieves and liars."}
{"text":"I ended up at this place with a group of 10 people on a Friday night

THE FOOD

We had a few various things: the tuna was rather good, quesadilla was just alright and apparently mac and cheese were rather uninspiring according to the mac and cheese aficionado.

The drinks were a bit pricy for what they are, but Nikolashka shot was actually pretty good. Good selection of beers, including a cherry beer from Belgium, which in itself easily took 1 or 2 stars from this review... read OTHER section for that :)

SETTING

I liked the restaurant setting being a semi-circle of sort, allowing more of an intimate feeling at each one of the tables. It is rather quiet and can be a good place for a date or a not overly loud get together.

SERVICE

For the most part, attentive. We were left to our own devices for some time at the beginning even though we were visibly ready to place orders. The waiter simply didn't pay attention to us even though he was circling and serving other tables.

OTHER

When the time came to pay the bill, the two cherry beers added up to $50, or $25 each. A staggering price that we questioned and were brought a menu that had the $25 price on it. The menu also happened to be different from the one we used. The waiter went back in to check other menus and found that the ones we used had a $13 price. Quite a difference. We didn't bother to check if any other prices mysteriously changed, but seems like a prudent thing to do for expensive/exotic drinks or dishes.

SUMMARY

Overall a decent place, but the different pricing on menus fiasco left a bitter taste. I simply cannot recommend going to a place where pricing mistakes of this sort can happen."}
{"text":"When you thought the chop salad couldn't get any better....then there was Cowboy Ciao:)"}
{"text":"It's a triple threat! Great ambiance, great food and great value!!!

Lunch or dinner expect a great time and dinning experience. Super casual and a bit fun-ky. On of my rotating favorites."}
{"text":"I felt like I was watching DMV employees. I walk up to the counter and 4 employees are leaning against the walls chatting. One makes eye contact with me and then looks back at his group so he can finish his story.   Once the story is finally over 1 of them comes to me to take my order. I ordered the burger and he says 10 to 12 minutes. Mind you they aren't busy. Dudes just standing around chatting and laughing. 25 minutes later I finally get my burger. It's a little over room temperature and bland. McDonald's two doors down would have been much wiser."}
{"text":"One word, WOW! The decor is great and usually this means that they are over compensating for something, but it's not food here. The food was excellent and the staff was attentive and courtesy. I'm a vegan and they even had a salad for me that made those in my party envious.  My hat's off to the chef and the owner. Great presentation, great staff, great atmosphere and most importantly, great food!"}
{"text":"Zero stars.  From walking in the door to our premature exit, this place had one strike after another.  We walked in, and there was a couple ahead of us who appeared to be having some issue with the maitre d'.  My guess is that they didn't have a reservation, and the two people behind the counter were trying to figure out where to seat them.  I understand that, but both people didn't need to help the one couple.  The two of them were staring at the computer screen like they were watching a movie.  Tick tock, tick tock.  Finally one of them went off to seat the couple.  We checked in (we had a reservation) and the guy seated us.  He wasn't particularly friendly, and acted like he was just going through the motions.  Tick tock, tick tock, waiting and waiting for somebody to come over and just bring us some water.  Finally our waiter, Jeremy, came over and gave us some menus, and left us.  Tick tock, tick tock.  Finally somebody brought us some water.  Finally Jeremy came back and asked us about drinks.  We ordered a bottle of wine, and his immediate response was that he didn't think they had any more of that wine, and he would have to check.  Tick tock, tick tock.  Jeremy's running all over the place, to other tables, and we're sitting there.  Finally he comes back to tell us that they're out of the wine that we wanted.  Fortunately I had another one picked out, after all, we had all this time to sit around waiting.  Wine finally comes out, and we're ready to order food.  Wouldn't you know it, they were out of one of the things we wanted.  Hello, did anybody ever think about crossing things off menus/lists, or maybe starting off by saying \"tonight we're out of...\"?  O.K. Jeremy, give us a minute so we can decide what else we want.  Tick tock, tick tock, waiting for him to come back again, so we can nail down the food order.  By this point we figure that if he doesn't come back in a few minutes, we're outta there.  He came back, we ordered, o.k., now we're committed.  Tick tock, tick tock, totally ignored, no bread, no amuse bouche or anything to nibble on, only wine going right to our heads.  We're noticing another couple who also appear to be ignored.  The table next to us is served their first dish, and we have squat.  That's the last straw.  Jeremy finally comes over, with our stinkin' mixed green salad and ciabatta, and I told him to forget it.  I said that we didn't know if they're short handed in the kitchen, but there's no reason why people who got here after us should be served before us, and a salad should come right out of the kitchen (it's already prepped, for crying out loud) and a ciabatta's already baked and just needs to be warmed up.  We asked him for the check for the wine, so we could get out of there.  He apologized, and when he returned a few minutes later, apologized again, said that it was his fault, and there was no charge for the wine.  Forty five minutes after walking in the door, we walked out, absolutely disgusted.  From the snooty maitre d' to inattentive, inept service, this place was pathetic.  I don't know how they stay in business with crap like that.  We're in the Scottsdale area on vacation, and came here when we were in town last year.  We just missed out on lunch service last time, so we made a special point of getting there this time around, and could not have been more disappointed."}
{"text":"Wow!   Love the restaurant, love the salad!  Our server was amazing.  The food was pricey but so worth it.  Great high quality restaurant, you certainly don't feel like your in a airport!   Wish we had a cowboy ciao in Tucson!  Keep up the good work, can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"Made a return trip this past week because my buddy raved over his chicken dish he got here a year ago(seriously. he went into the kitchen after the meal and thanked the cook). No dice this time. Us being a group of four rolled into this joint without a reservation hoping to get seated. Imagine our delight when we walk into a place with less than half the tables occupied. The host went over to the bartender after we spoke with him and we got the look. You know the look. It's an over the shoulder glance of disgust and \"not these people\". The host returned and told us a 1 hour wait. I believe my half buzzed response was no way or something to that effect. The wife pointed towards the plethora of empty tables and we were told those were reservations. Immediately I called Guinness Book because this place had to be near setting a record for reservations. We mosied on over to another establishment that probably blows this one out of the water. You get 1 star because I have to give you one and another for the grub my buddy had last year."}
{"text":"I was doubtful, have to admit it. This place was divine. Great service from TJ. He was charming (also easy on the eyes) and really sold it. The Stetson salad was one of the best meals I've had in 3 weeks. Really good iced tea. I wouldn't think that it would be hard to make good iced tea, but some places struggle. Have someone to eat now when I fly through Phoenix."}
{"text":"One of the better places to eat at the airport- spent $20 on a salad, but service was quick, food fresh, and close to domestic flights. I would recommend checking out if you are in Gate B"}
{"text":"Yummy Stetson Chopped Salad. Great service- quick but not rushed. And wall plugs to charge devices while you dine. Well worth the walk from another part of the airport."}
{"text":"My faith in non-Mexican Arizona cuisine has been restored.  Maybe I just don't head in to Scottsdale enough.  That is going to change.  Cowboy Ciao is a new favorite, especially for this mushroom lover.  The chevre, beet, scallop risotto isn't bad either."}
{"text":"A pretty good airport restaurant. The mushrooms by themself are worth four stars. Very good service."}
{"text":"Airport food can be a gamble but this place is spot on. Breakfast Enchiladas were amazing. They can highly recommended by the bartender and he wasn't lying at all. Delicious! Will definitely be coming back when I have time to kill at the airport."}
{"text":"I didn't have any food here but the service was awesome and the Bloody Mary is super spicy and delicious!!"}
{"text":"Food was amazing!!! And prices was fair for the quality of food you get. Waiter was nice. The setting looks more like a bar than elegant will be back again. I love the wine sampler."}
{"text":"Great food and service in a western modern like setting. As a party of 6, we all got different entrees and they were all equally delicious and innovative! My favorites were the ahi tuna sandwich and the san francisco brisket one. You can tell the everything used here is very fresh and top notch quality. I felt like the tuna was sushi grade and it did taste like! Amazing! They also piled the brisket high on my sandwich and was the perfect, yet unusual, combination with the arugula and brie and fontina cheeses. If you are around the area or have guests come over, please stop by here and you won't regret the choice! A+!!"}
{"text":"Great..had the enchilada, best enchilada I have every had, plus service was great.


Enjoy"}
{"text":"Elizabeth with black short hair was one of the most rudest and annoying employee I have ever came across at a Resturaunt.  This place has a great rep from it's place I. Scottsdale.  Let's hope this lady will not ruin it with the new one at the airport.  Horrible service, rude, and annoying- unbelievable"}
{"text":"Food was OK, but certainly nothing special. The service was abominably slow, which in an airport is not just a minor inconvenience, but unforgivable. Don't eat here unless you've got several hours to kill."}
{"text":"I went to this place with a family member upon their recommendation.  

The salad was amazing!  I forget exactly what it is called (cowboy chopped salad I think?) .  Firstly it's gorgeous (comes in rows of the ingredients which are beautiful colors; arugula, tomatoes, pepitas, dried currents, chicken, asiago cheese, and dried corn for some crunch)  Then when it gets to your table they pour on the dress (a creamy dressing with a slight basil taste to it), and it all gets mixed together.  

I believe it usually comes with salmon instead of chicken but we ordered ours with chicken and it was a great fit, I highly suggest it. 

The rest of the menu looked amazing too, but I'm not sure I could go there and not get the salad.  So I suggest going with multiple people, splitting the salad and then splitting another entree.  

The decor of the place could probably use a little sprucing up and it's a bit on the cheesy side.  

Service wise was unfortunately not the greatest experience.  It was a slow time and we had a hard time getting our bill or being asked if we needed anything else.  Thus the deduction of a star.  But I would still give it another try just for the food."}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant several times, all for the same darn salad!  The Stetson's Chopped Salad is...hmm..might I dare say the BEST salad I've ever eatten!  I live in CA and have actually booked some training in Scottsdale, only so I could eat this salad!  

Not a big fan of the cowboy motif, but based on how good this salad is, I can look past it!  And I will say this place has a decent wine list (coming from a Napa Valley Wino).  

I've tried other items on the menu as well, and I will say all were good - even down to their burgers!   A must try - the Stetson Chopped Salad for sure!!"}
{"text":"solid spot to spend if you happen to have a layover in phoenix airport. the hubby and i grabbed a table during brunch time. 

he drank beers, and i went with spicy tito bloody marys. a double will run you around $15 a pop. 

the menu sounded really appetizing, a little bit of everything to choose from. mike ordered the PLT- pancetta, lettuce, and tomato on a muffin with spicy mayo. the pancetta was def just bacon, and the spicy mayo was mayo. so pretty ordinary for the high price. it came with really delicious homemade potato chips. could've ate like 3 bowls of those! i had an order of the biscuits and gravy. the gravy seemed to be bacon based, interesting change from the usual sausage base. the biscuits it was poured over were decent. i liked the addition of crispy fried onions on top. 

cowboy ciao is definitely a solid alternative to your standard airport dining experiences."}
{"text":"Cowboy Ciao was like a roller coaster for my senses. Visually, the scene is stimulating: bold splotches of color on the walls, romantic gold leaf, dramatic lighting, rustic Old West, funky art and decor, and asymmetrical table placement creates a sense of artistic chaos and  charm. The aromas in Cowboy Ciao sent my olfactory bulb into overdrive, vamping up my anticipation (and appetite) for a most sensuous and savory meal. Acoustically, the restaurant was distracting. Muffled speech and loud laughter droned throughout the meal. I could hardly hear my new friends (including new Yelper Stan W.!) across the table.  My tactile senses noticed the comfortable leather chairs, and most importantly, the weight of the wine glasses - useful to notice when my glass was only half full! Finally, the food and the wine surpassed my gustatory expectations. I expected everything to be well-executed, but I was very impressed with the inventiveness of the dishes and the medley of flavors. The menu itself is a masterpiece, with quirky names for dishes, funky descriptions, and hilarious quotes - it is just fun to read through. My favorite dish, in addition to the perfection of the Stetson salad, was the seared scallops and beet risotto with goat cheese and dill. The combination of flavors was unexpected and to die for. I cannot deny my love for beets, but that risotto brought my appreciation to a new level. The exotic mushroom pan fry and the blue cheese cheesecake were also entirely unique, flavorful, and delicious. Stan W. was less impressed by his meal, but did swoon over the cheescake. And yes, it is swoon-worthy. As for the wine, the list is just extravagant (oenophilia-tastic)! With over 3,200 labels organized in a rather confusing manner, it is quite a daunting task to make the right choice; but with a little guidance from our gracious server, we were quite happy with our selections. 

Overall, I was very impressed with my first visit to Cowboy Ciao. The atmosphere, the food, the wine, and the service make Cowboy Ciao a little gem in Scottsdale that easily suits every occasion. It is a wonderful place for a birthday dinner, a romantic evening out, or a fun night with friends. For out of town guests, this is a perfect stop for a unique and entertaining AZ experience. Ciao, a presto!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I were looking for a place to grab a bite to eat before we started out a day in Scottsdale and came across this place. The inside has some interesting decorations that are cool to look at and the window seats are great for people watching. 

Our server was very friendly and gave me a great recommendations on the steak sandwich. Great sandwich and an interesting take on it. It's kinda cheesy but I had a root beer to go along with my meal instead of a cocktail and I was very pleased with my choice. My girlfriend had a wrap which tasted fresh and tasty. Overall positive experience that I would recommend. We are not from the area but it looks like they have night time events that could please any type of audience."}
{"text":"Visiting from D.C. We enjoyed a nice dinner.  Bruschetta was good.  My wife ordered the Testosterone salad and thought it was great.  Lettuce was chopped nicely and the beef strips layered on to were tender and tasty.

My swordfish was perfectly cooked and the cream sauce that came with it very nicely complimented the fish.  However, the sauce and all the vegetables on which the fish was presented were way too salty for my taste, so much so you would think the chef slipped and accidentally dumped the entire salt container into the mix.

Service was good.  Our waiter was friendly and knowledgeable but w e felt a bit hurried through appetizers and the main course."}
{"text":"The food was excellent. I think this is the best prepared salmon I've had in a long while. I'm certainly going to look for more of these restaurants wherever I can find them!"}
{"text":"I had great expectations for this restaurant; wasn't sure what to expect but I left mildly disappointed.  Odd menu - must be a food adventuresome.  The Stetson chopped salad lives up to the hype - choose the smoked salmon option.  it's the only item I would come back for. You'd better love mushrooms if Exotic Mushroom Pan Fry - aside from a very heavy gravy/stew, it has very few other ingredients. The flavor is good but after just a few bites, I was done.  Also ordered the pork chop - overcooked and tough.  The blue cheese stuffing wasn't enough moisture to compensate. The bread pudding/fig compote is a nice touch but the dish didn't need anything else dry on the plate.  The only other bright spot is the dessert called Cereal, Killer.  Cute name - good flavor.  Skip the Oh Canada, Peanut Butter Bar - it's mediocre.  There are better places to eat in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Seriously good for airport food. Spendy, but worth it. I had pasta w pulled pork, great flavor, generous serving, good service. If it wasn't for the two blowhards sitting next to me trying to one up each other for an hour with their self importance it would have been an amazing meal. :)"}
{"text":"Cowboy Ciao is a perfect example of a restaurant that teeters between 3 and 4 stars. A lot of things we tried here were good, but the likelihood that I'll fly to Phoenix just so I can get my hands on their cuisine is highly unlikely. To distill: It's good, but not that special. 

Nevertheless, the meal I shared was enjoyable. Things I didn't think I'd like (mushroom pan fry w/ polenta) I really liked, and things I thought I'd love (chopped salad) weren't enjoyable. The chopped salad everyone raves about has smoked salmon, which is on my list of nastiest ingredients for a salad ever. 

The shrimp and grits \"grazing\" plate was yummy, but neither the best shrimp nor the best grits I'd ever tried. My entree was the Puerco Lento, a braised pork shank in southwestern spicing, and it was okay but disappointing. The meat was not as tender as it could be and it seemed to be served atop a queso fundido soup with slices of potato. Whoever thought that was the best preparation for this dish has interesting and white-trashy taste. Velveeta, anyone?

Our server was very nice and to my delight Cowboy Ciao serves bottled Diet Coke (a delicious rarity). The restaurant has dim but appropriate lighting, yet the atmosphere is on the casual and cold side. The menu struck me as upscale eclectic and unpretentious, but the taste tended to be heavy handed and their execution wasn't the best. 

It's possible that I'd come back here, but for vacationers (like I was), I'd recommend going elsewhere. This isn't special or great enough to visit when you're in the city for only a few days."}
{"text":"Had the flat iron steak with basmati rice and vegetables - the meal was good, but nothing memorable - might try their filet with mashed potatoes next time.  Very nice atmosphere and plenty of room at the bar which was nice."}
{"text":"Bacon wasn't cooked. Ranks in my husbands worst breakfasts ever. Constant flagging down of waitstaff needed. Extremely expensive $24 not good enchiladas."}
{"text":"Excellent. Great service. Amazing food!  I Had a the \"Puerco Lento\", a pork shank cooked with cumin, chipotle, and paprika.  Served in a creamy sauce with potatoes.  My husband had the special which was a giant steak that he managed to polish off.  \"The best steak I've ever had\", he said.  The next time we are in Phoenix we will have to come back here!"}
{"text":"Came here with my man's family on Christmas Eve night. 

Let me start by saying that our waiter (Owen) was one of THE BEST waiters i have ever had. He was very friendly, always on top of it, and very helpful with recommendations. 

Here's what we had and what i recommend: 

Entrees: 

Me: New Zealand Lamb Loin - TO DIE FOR! They usually make it medium-rare, but i am not a fan of bloodiness, so when i asked if i could get it medium-well instead, the response was \"Absolutely!\" The meat was cooked perfectly and the artichoke risotto was fantastic! 

My Man, Man's Sister, Man's Dad: Puerco Lento - the pork was so tender and was falling of the bone. The sauce it came with was delicious. Everybody loved it. My man enjoyed it so much he finished The Sister's leftover meat. 

Man's Mom: Exotic Mushroom Pan Fry - our friendly and helpful waiter Owen recommended she gets the small one because the big one is apparently really big. Boy, the small one was so huge we could only guess how big the big one would have been... 

Dessert: 

The Man, Man's Dad: Breakfast of The Champions - i had a couple bites - absolutely delicious! 

Man's Sister & Mom: shared the pudding - had a bite as well - very yummy! 

Myself: Cheesecake - pretty darn good! 

I must also add that the wine was fantastic, and while Me & The Sister had a glass of red & white, The Dad ordered a flight of red - there was more than plenty of wine in that flight! 

The only small disappointment i had was the ciabatta bread - it was fresh and delicious but i thought there was too little of it. 

The design of the place is very unique and the menu is very funky. With superb food and fabulous service this place certainly has a great atmosphere. I will definitely go back next time we visit my man's folks!"}
{"text":"Excited to experience a showdown between Elote chef Jeff Smedstad (who we have long loved and think is the best Mexican chef in the US) and the Chef at Cowboy Ciao, we arrived with high expectations for a special meal.  The premise was each chef was to prepare 2 dishes, with wine pairings, and the crowd was to vote and pick the best dish and pairings.  What a great premise-- right?  Unfortunately, the meal was disappointing.  The first shrimp course was cold, overcooked, chewy and flavorless.  The other courses that followed were cold, under seasoned and just plain bad in our view.  Smedstad should be ashamed and embarrassed.  His culinary work is so strong at Elote.  He is a true genius.  Not sure what happened here, but this food was not up to the standards of a chef of his caliber.  The wine pairings were fun;  however, several of the wines were whites and rose, which is not necessarily a bad thing, but these wines were served about 20 degrees too warm, which made even some very nice wines unpleasant.  The restaurant seemed ill equipped to handle a crowd of this size-- it took way too long to serve each course, which likely explains why the food was cold and the wine was warm.  In any event, we will not be back to Cowboy Ciao."}
{"text":"The Mushroom dish (I can't remember what it's called exactly but you'll see it they have a appetizer plate and a Main course plate on the menu.  Anyway, the mushroom dish is definitely worth ordering."}
{"text":"My favorite salad on the planet is the Stetson Salad at Cowboy Ciao. Go here if you're a winehead or if you just enjoy really good food. It's pricey so be sure to pack a fat wallet or your corporate card so you can write it off."}
{"text":"The food is awesome! Particularly, the quesadilla del dia and the chopped salad are great! Even the bread pudding cake left us scooping the plate dry.

One fault- the margaritas are way to tart and sweet. Don't expect a real margarita; it's counterfeit. 

But don't let that steer you away from this place in terminal four, space D. Everything else is great, especially the Bloody Mary's!"}
{"text":"If this is airport dining, I need to fly through Phoenix more often. The food was fresh and flavorful and the service excellent! I wouldn't have stumbled upon them if not for my missed connection - thanks, US Air!!"}
{"text":"Seriously amazing food! Awesome staff! Very friendly. Made excellent recommendations!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed the food and liked the fact that there are smaller sharing plates.

We got the Ciao Mixed Greens (spring tomato, white balsamic, pesto buttermilk, mustard vinaigrette) which was solid.  The Cheeks & Beans had really tender beef cheek meat, and the Burrata Bonanza (with avocado, arugula, radish, fried shallots) was good as well. 

One of the signature dishes they had was the Mushroom Pan Fry.  We got the mini version, and I really enjoyed the sauce it came in.  It's a bit of a misnomer since whenever I see \"pan fry\" I think of \"stir fry\" but this dish was definitely not a stir fry.  The sauce was thick and creamy, and had sort of a tomato base.  Would be good to eat with bread or something.

Liked the decor as well.  I'd consider coming back if I was in the area again."}
{"text":"The whole dinner was incredible, but the Stetson chopped salad alone is enough to bring me back- it's a must if you dine here.  Extensive wine list.  Short ribs were boneless and huge, more meat than I ever expected.  They definitely had some spice which I really enjoyed.  Great food, great service. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Holy crap. Next time I am near Scottsdale I will come back. It is not inexpensive but the food is out if this world."}
{"text":"Very, very pricey. I just hope the price is consistent to the taste.

I thought my braised Korean ribs were really good. The meat was tender, easily falls of the bone. The mash potatoes were okay, a little cold when I got them and the veggies were cooked well. This and the other sandwich place are probably good bets to have good food in the airport."}
{"text":"It's trendy, noisy, can be hard to get a reservation for, and some of the overly clever menu items will disappoint.

But you still might go here for the mushroom pan fry, because the ancho sauce? It really is THAT GOOD.

Salads are consistently overdressed; desserts miss the mark; cocktails are a bit too sweet typically. 

And yet I've gone back more than a couple times for the 'shrooms. So, if you're there, and you can get a table, I still say go try it. Service is typically good - quick and unobtrusive. Cheese plate is interesting and worth sharing."}
{"text":"My husband and I were really excited to try Cowboy Ciao after all the rave reviews we'd seen on Yelp and were definitely not disappointed - at least not by the food and drinks. The fact that we were less than impressed with the atmosphere (really dark, decor kind of reminded me of Black Angus) and staff (our server was overly enthusiastic when presenting the specials but not around when you needed more water or the check) isn't enough to make me take away a star or two because the food and drinks were delicious and well-prepared enough to make the experience a great one despite these drawbacks. 

I got the Movie Star Martini, and my husband got some version of the Manhattan (can't remember the name) - both drinks tasted like well-thought-out concoctions and were definitely worth the $10-$12 (which is something I cannot say for many over-priced restaurant cocktails). We started with the oh-so-famous Chopped and it was heavenly. We actually didn't like the Buffalo Carpaccio as much as we hoped we would - while the meat itself was tender and fresh, the chef had overseasoned it and the espresso and cumin flavors were overpowering. 

For our entrees, we had the pork chop stuffed with blue cheese and bread pudding and the short ribs with cherry bbq sauce. We were both impressed that the server asked if we were ok with having the pork slightly undercooked -this preparation is really the most flavorful, but many people remain uncomfortable with undercooked pork because of the trichinosis incidents of many years ago. Having it prepared this way made it so tender, and the meat's flavor was complemented by the bread pudding, figs/raisins, and flavorful sauce that accompanied it. The beef short ribs were also deliciously tender and came with a hearty but so rich serving of pecan grits. My favorite part was definitely the tangy barbecue sauce with whole cherries in it. 

Overall, this was a great (although expensive!) meal, and I am sure that we will return to Cowboy Ciao (maybe with guests from out of town) although the slightly-pretentious decor, service, and concept will probably prevent us from making this a more frequent destination."}
{"text":"I can't say enough about the chopped salad. Seriously. I want it to-go everyday.

Also, the mac and cheese was really great - just a little spicy.

Great selection of beers, I loved my 1554.

It's a romantic and warm atmosphere, and our server Julio was so nice, and his recommendations were spot on."}
{"text":"This was recommended to me by a co-worker, based on my love of wine.  We brought out the readers, inspected the novel size wine list and placed our order.  Our waiter, Ray (who was awesome by the way!) told us that they *might not have that bottle, and that if they didn't, he would find something similar.  That made me nervous, but sure enough he found a really good bottle of wine and charged us what the other bottle would have been!  I had the filet, ordered medium and most of it was excellent, but there was a slight section in the very middle that was very rare.  The piece of meat was so big, that by the time I got to the middle, I was full.  The sauce on it was ok.  The Asiago bread was amazing!  There were 3 of us and we decided to split a dessert.  We asked Ray what his fav was, and we ordered the Cereal Killer.  OMG!!!  Don't leave without ordering that!"}
{"text":"I had THE BEST pork belly here ever!! When the dish came, I was confused with all the belly fat and not much meat.  After I bite into it, I saw the food heaven!! I can forget all about how fat and evil it is.  My hubby and I were literally fighting for it, haha!
The stetson chop salad was not bad.  The mushroom dish was very hearty.  Bread pudding was divine!
If we were local, that would be our usual for sure!"}
{"text":"Exceptional food, service and cocktails. We will definitely be back for another Stetson Salad!"}
{"text":"My first visit was last night with a friend, and we experienced terrible service. I'm not a big complainer or full of difficult requests as I worked in the industry for 5 years, but this was bad.  After we were sat and given menus, we were basically deserted. We had already picked what we wanted to order for dinner yet hadn't even been brought waters yet. We had to walk to the bar to ask if anyone was going to come serve us at the table.

Finally were able to order and the food was pretty good. Our server checked on us right after we got our food and then never again. We had to walk to the bar again to ask for boxes and our bill. Both of our water glasses had been empty half the meal. 

I'm not sure what was going on, but I'm hesitant to go back after this experience. We tipped 15% which was not even remotely close to being deserved, but as I mentioned I've worked in the industry and don't believe in stiffing people. Normally I would never tip below 20%+. If I'd had more time I would have asked to speak to a manager."}
{"text":"Food was fantastic, as was the service.  However, after dinner the 10 of us (3 couples and 6 singles who ordered a wide variety of food and drink) had to figure out our share of the food, taxes, and added gratuity.  Amazing that with computers that separate checks could not be given.  We won't be going back with a large group."}
{"text":"Cowboy Ciao is one my favorite restaurants in Old Town Scottsdale.  To start with, they share a wine list with Kazimierz.  My favorite menu item is the Stetson Chopped salad.  My only wish is that the serving was bigger!  I can't get enough...and I'm too embarrassed to order two.  The flavors in this salad are amazing!  Smoked salmon, Israeli cous cous, creamy dressing.

For dinner, I actually like the Exotic Mushroom Pan Fry.  The tastes are really unique and I got to try mushrooms I hadn't had before.  It's great!

I did try the Bacon Peanut Brittle for dessert and I cannot recommend this.  It was not good at all.  It just makes the brittle really greasy and then you run into chunks of bacon...ick.  Thank God my husband ordered the Chocolate/Peanut Butter pot pie so I could steal from him!"}
{"text":"We came for a \"Sommelier Showdown\" event. This was the third time we'd come for one, as previous experiences were very good. Tonight's was far off the mark. 

First, they shifted us over to the Kazimierz bar, as they apparently booked two events for the same night. Second, they changed the menu from what was published. The first two courses were made up last minute. Third, the food was cold. Fourth, service was slow. Fifth, the food was not good. Sixth, since this event was focused on wine, I thought it cheap that on the last course they served us the same cheap wine they had given us on the first course. 

Lastly, they had the audacity to automatically add a 20% gratuity before handing me the bill. This after I had decided the gratuity would be minimal. American Express and I will have a little conversation about that one.

Sorry Cowboy Ciao, we're done giving you our business. There are far too many other great restaurants for me to bother coming back."}
{"text":"Excellent food! The side of corn is amazing. Good service. Big portions. Not overly business for being a Scottsdale staple. The knock I would give is that the Moscow Mule and Jack/diet was mediocre."}
{"text":"I've visited Cowboy Ciao many many times in the past and have always enjoyed it. 

Nowadays, it felt like an abortion must feel like to a 15 year old. The food was absolutely horrific. Sure, the Stetson Chopped Salad was tremendous as always, but my duck and brie sandwich as well as my girlfriend's papardelle pasta were flavorless messes. 

The service at Cowboy Ciao was the saving grace. I didn't get our servers name, but he was cordial and efficient. I'm going to give it one more shot for lunch, since for years it was my favorite lunch spot in Old Town, and I hate to lose it. It really was just awful though.

1 star for food but 4 for service."}
{"text":"I came here on a recommendation by a friend and I would recommend it to you.  It's a little out of the way from the 5th St. shops, but they have some inventive cuisine.  It maintains its southwestern flavor but has a splash of modern Californian.  It is, however, a meat-heavy place.

Times visited: 2"}
{"text":"First time to this place for a birthday dinner. Great atmosphere and the food was AMAZING!!! The reason for the stars is the service wasn't so great. Our waiter was short, impatient and seemed bothered by every question she was asked. It was our FIRST time so we would ask questions like \"what do you recommend?\" \"What are portion sizes like?\" She was not friendly at all and it made the entire evening a bomb. The food though definitely saved the night, it was amazing to say the least. The Stetson Salad as all the comments before me was amazing. We had the ribs and omg unbelievable..."}
{"text":"On a recent trip to Phoenix I decided to go to Cowboy Ciao. The food was excellent and the restaurant had a great wine selection. I would highly recommend the signature salad!"}
{"text":"Great place, warm atmosphere with a great selection of wines and beers at the airport."}
{"text":"Location - Corner lot in downtown Scottsdale.
Reservations - Highly recommended.  Place was extremely busy when we arrived at 8:30 and even after we finished dinner.
Parking - Structure, street or valet nearby.
Service - Good and friendly
Decor/Ambiance -  Cowboyish (not a word but you get my drift), dark, wood.
Price - Not extravagant, but pricey.  Worth it since you probably won't try fusions like this anywhere.
Food - Don't eat here if you are picky.  The fusions/flavors are very unique. 
1. Mini Mushroom Pan Fry- Good amount for 3 to 4 people as an appetizer.  Quite rich.  I wouldn't call it exceptional like other Yelpers but definitely good to at least try once.  Huge variety of mushrooms (although it seemed like mainly button mushrooms or something very similar) sauteed in a rich tomato cream sauce over grilled polenta triangles.  

2. Stetson Chopped -  I yelped this place before trying.  However, I could not find a real description of what this salad was.  Now I know why.  It's sooooo unique and the texture is unlike anything you've tried.  It's one of those dishes, you have to try to truly understand.  Most people would describe it as \"very different but good.\"  Even the menu doesn't describe the ingredients.  Server brings it out with the ingredients perfectly lined. a) Bruschetta tomato compote minus the bread of course, b)  Dried kernels of corn, c) Pumpkin seed trail mix, d) Chopped spinach I think, e) Couscous, and f) Cured wild salmon, similar to lox.  Then the server mixes it with a mild dressing that is similar to ranch.  The end result, a wildly unique texture of crunchy flavors with the occassional taste of cured fish.  You have to try it to know what I'm talking about it.

3. Stuffed Pork Rib Chop - Disappointing.  It sounded sooooooooo good on paper and via other Yelpers.  The pork chop was slightly dry although my friend and I ordered ours medium.  The blue cheese stuffing was really overpowering.  The ancho bread pudding was weird tasting and a bit too mushy.  The raisin/fig compote was a bit sweet and a good contrast at first to the strong blue cheese, but then tasted really weird after a while.  The flavors didn't mesh well to me.   I felt that every flavor was too drastically strong and were all competing against each other.

4. Espresso-Rubbed Filet Mignon - Highly recommended.   You couldn't taste the espresso but it provided a rich earthy taste to the meat.  The meat was nicely salted and very tender.  No one cared for the bright yellow chipotle aioli which was just creamy but had added no other taste to the meat.  The glaze was good as were the potatoes. 

5. Bacon/Chocolate Chip Cookies - Everyone was stuffed so I didn't order the blue cheese cheesecake with black pepper ice cream. I really wanted to try it!  However, the cookie was good.  We were a bit timid, but all agreed that it was better than it sounded.  A bit of salty and sweet.  The bacon is cooked first and then added to the cookie dough along with bacon grease.  Therefore, you could taste the bacon note but then you are left with a chocolate finish.  Quite delicious.

I would definitely come back here though, if only for the Stetson salad.  The fushion of ingredients are truly unique and I have to give the chef two thumbs up for trying to blend flavors that you don't ordinarily pair together."}
{"text":"Since I was already here I had to stop by one of my favorite, plan my day around restaurants.  
Just be prepared to wait or fight for a seat at the bar since even on a Tuesday night this place is crowded.  Once you have some of the food you will know why.......

Here is some must haves, Stetson salad, Pork belly, mac and cheese, the scallop dish looks large and delicious.  Unfortunately on shellfish I can only look and not sample :(

Also try the bread pudding and maybe the chocolate covered bacon on the way out.  Anything with chocolate and bacon must be good?  2 of my favorite food groups :)"}
{"text":"Food was tasty. Service was SLOW.

I have been back twice since this dinner, and my two-star review stands.  The food is no doubt good.  However the wait time is extremely lacking and will make me consider other establishment in the future."}
{"text":"This restaurant helped pioneer Scottsdale's reputation as a foodie city and Cowboy Ciao is still one of the most consistently excellent places that I've had the pleasure of dining. The menu is sparse, and for good reason, every single dish is done to perfection. The Stetson Chopped Salad is a thing of local legend (which has been copied by numerous area restaurants). After demolishing the salad we indulged ourselves by sharing the Buffalo Carpaccio followed by their Short Rib with potatoes and brussle sprouts. Magnificent."}
{"text":"Went here for restaurant week.  Our server was very good and attentive.  The food was so-so.  I have had better short ribs at other restaurant but give them a B for the smoked pastrami flavor.  The sword fish was the thinnest sword fish I have ever seen.  We were mildly disappointed."}
{"text":"We came here while on a business trip to Scottsdale.  Old Towne Scottsdale is such a nice little area.  We were able to walk from our hotel to this restaurant.  I called late afternoon on a Friday and they were able to get a party of 8 in at the time we wanted.  We were so surprised and pleased, since this was was a referral from one of the people that attended the seminar with us.

We sat at a long table for 8.  The ambiance there was amazing!  The waiter came to our table and we could tell from the start he was irritated.  We ordered our drinks, nothing wow wow!  He did suggest the VIVA is the most popular, I opted for the bloody mary and my friends the mai tais, prosecco Bellini and mai tais.  

The Stetson salad we ordered two for 6 of us to share.  WOW, JUST WOW!  This salad was the BEST salad I have ever had.  It is mixed at your table and is so yummy! I think this is a protected recipe because they do not even list what is in this mixture, but I could have liked the plate!

We all ordered entrees and shared a bit.  We ordered the filet with asparagus, mashed potatoes.  The Short ribs with brussel sprouts, and mashed potatoes.  The filet was in the top 3 steaks I have ever eaten!  It was served with a blue cheese butter.  I asked for it to be medium, came out medium well, but I had no complaints, it was so tender no knife was needed.  The short ribs too, were so tender you did not need a knife. The mushroom entree is super rich, so it's better shared as side but order the entree size for a large group.  The cream best sauce, is super rich and make mushrooms taste like candy!

We did not opt for dessert since we were stuffed. The portions are great!  The bottled wine list, is huge, it's truly a thick binder of lists of wines.  We did not opt for a bottle of wine.

I would have rated this experience a 5 but the waiters frustration with us was apparent the entire time.  No  one complained, asked for food to be sent back. nothing special.  It truly seemed like he didn't normally serve, or was having a super bad day.  Service was not good and it tainted the experience.  Every one in our party mentioned his shortness, sighs, and visually frustrations. But the food was so great, it outweighted the service."}
{"text":"Loved the service from Douglas! Explained to him my flight left in an hour he set me up with a quick and tasty recommendation, a glass of wine to set the mood of the 4 hour flight ahead and all Is good! Thank you Douglas!"}
{"text":"Quick service, decent food for breakfast, lunch and dinner. There's also a full time bar for those that need to get a buzz before or after their plane ride. Staff was nice and they keep their place clean."}
{"text":"Cowboy Ciao is one of the most unique restaurants I have ever been to - food wise.  We went for lunch on a really quiet Saturday.  I kept hearing great things about the Stetson chopped salad and I must say it is amazing.  One of the best (or at least different) salads I have ever had!  There are a ton of different ingredients in it, but somehow it worked!  It's definitely a must have.  I am a huge mushroom-lover so of course I had to try the mushroom pan-fry.  I had no idea what to expect since there aren't many restaurants where you can order a mushroom entree.  It was basically a few varieties of mushrooms mixed with some veggies and polenta and served in this thick savory gravy like sauce.  Although I thought it was really good, it was also very rich and a bit hard to finish a large portion of it.  I do agree that it should be served with some rice or bread soak up the excess sauce.  Another stand-out item was the bacon peanut brittle.  Sounds weird, but it was amazing!  Who knew bacon and peanut worked so well together!  I definitely recommend this place if you want to try dishes you can't find elsewhere."}
{"text":"Full thoughts blogged.

...to call the concept, website, and descriptors of Cowboy Ciao eclectic would be an understatement to say the least - it is almost so \"out there\" that I'd considered skipping it entirely until one of my dining companions at Pizzeria Bianco suggested that not only was it worth inclusion on my agenda, but that he'd be glad to meet me for lunch - an offer I gladly accepted.  

With somewhat shaky padded wooden chairs at each table and a menu delivered at seating my friend and I sat browsing the interior of Peter Kasperski's 1997 space with some amusement; From Mardi Gras beads strewn across chandeliers to wall paintings befitting a mom n' pop Italian space to the largely western themed exposed brick and stucco apparently little has changed in the intervening 15 years.  Chuckling to myself as I opened the menu with quotations ranging from Spaceballs to The Addams family it would be mere moments before our server, John, would stop by to fill our water and announce the daily specials.  With the afternoon crowd clearly slow and John, a good waiter but a bit more corny than would have been preferred, ever present it would be mere moments before we were ready to order and confirming all our choices as \"excellent\" we were left to chat

Discussing real estate, travel, and the area of Old-town Scottsdale it would be a mere 15 minutes before our first courses would arrive and for my appetizer I selected Duck Confit Relleno with roasted shallots, queso Oaxaca, cheddar, and roasted guajillo-tomatillo salsa, I will fully admit that I ordered this dish largely based on the fowl but what I received turned out to be large, bold, and unexpectedly quite sweet.  Beginning first with the Relleno itself, a cored pasilla chili pepper absolutely stuffed with confit and cheese then fried and coated with even more cheese the flavor was exemplary.  With fresh sliced avocado and the squeaky cheese taming the pepper while the crisp duck nicely juxtaposed the creamy cheddar it was the green salsa that really served as the most surprising part of this dish - an acidic pineapple flavor with a slightly heated finish.

For ours second course we'd see Cowboy Ciao's most famous dishes - first the \"Stetson Chopped,\" I had the opportunity to watch the beautifully arranged salad of couscous, arugula, tomato, cheese, pepitas, corn, salmon, and currants come together before my eyes.  Never one to be wowed by a salad, particularly one with a mayo based dressing I will admit that the presentation and composition of this dish did intrigue me enough to take a couple of bites and while indeed a salad I could just as easily make at home I really did love the variety of textures and flavors hiding beneath a dressing that although hefty was quite refreshing with notes of basil, onion, garlic, and lemon beneath the slightly sour creamy tones.

If the Stetson is not Cowboy Ciao's most fabled item then my main course most certainly was, a dish described simply as the Exotic Mushroom Pan Fry.  Again topped with chopped avocados, cheese, and tomatoes and consisting of \"mucho mushrooms (including cremini, button, oyster, cepe, lobster, black trumpet, shiitake, morel, yellow foot)\" in ancho cream over double-cooked polenta the pan fry would prove to be many things, not the least of which being the richest vegetarian dish I've ever tasted.  Beginning first with the mushrooms - a blend I have a hard time calling exotic as each can be found at your local Whole Foods - I will admit that the variety of flavors and textures were truly impressive, particularly as they related to the hearty and complex sauce.  With each bite a different experience depending on the balance of mushrooms and vegetables this was exactly the sort of dish I love though I really could have done without the polenta - a thick gob that was so wet it did nothing to soak up any of the sauce and as such tasted like a wet sponge in the middle of the dish.

Having requested some bread to assist in sopping up the rest of the ancho cream (bread that is 'baked to order,' largely flavorless on its own, and an unlisted $2 for three meager rolls) John would arrive as my friend was finishing his salad and I was sopping up the last of my sauce to ask if we would be interested in dessert and with my love of bread pudding well documented I selected \"Bread Pudding Overboard\" which arrived on a large plate in a relatively modest portion. .  Beginning first with buttery brioche - the sort they should have served instead of those dinner rolls - nicely soaked in caramel custard and dotted with dried cherries, craisins, and pine nuts the steaming hot bread pudding was of good quality and firm texture; a good but not stunning representation on its own.  Moving next to the toppings - a trio of brown sugar streusel, praline cream, and American Oak ice cream the overall effect was sweet, sweet, and sweet - not inherently a bad thing, but a bit of overkill."}
{"text":"Why, everybody's talkin' about the Stetson salad. Did YOU hear about the Stetson salad? Why, yes, I did hear about the Stetson salad, and I ordered the Stetson salad, and I LOVED the Stetson salad. Lucky you! That Stetson salad is on my Must Eat list, I'm flying to Phoenix, right now, to get me one of those Stetson salads. It's worth the airfare, promise! Safe travels!

That's the way I'm seeing this Yelp page trending. It's like a summer blockbuster that, like, everybody and their mother has seen and -- gasp! -- you haven't made it to the theater yet. It's your patriotic duty to eat this friggin' salad, you corporate automaton. Why? Well, aside from it being a healthy antiserum for those cocktails you consumed during the conference, it's likely the tastiest airport food you'll ever encounter. They nail the consistency of the salmon, too; not dry, but not so pink and fleshy that you tremble. Israeli couscous and pupitas? Wow. Put this one on the company credit card, those bastards owe you this bonus. 

And yeah, I'll agree with the other critics, the service was so friendly and efficient, what a cast. My waitress swore she recognized me, and the more she said it, the more familiar she looked to me, too. It was one of those conversations. Fun. GO."}
{"text":"If you have a layover, you need to stop in here for a bite.  The owner must be brilliant because they have all price ranges and just what you want when you are traveling combined with gourmet options.

Kenna took care of us, she was personable and professional, a usually tough balance.

The Punk had chicken and waffles. Her quotes, \"Everything is SO good!\" , \"I wish I could eat here again later!\", \"These are the best waffles I've ever had!\", \"We can eat here all the time and I will get the same thing over and over!\" Pretty sure she liked it.

They also offered to allow us to bring in nearby McDonald's for the Punk, so if you have little ones that like what they like, this is your best option. 

I tried the pastrami style ribs, I must admit, they were different and really good. I would get them again even if they are the most expensive thing on the menu.

We had a guest diner who tried the sweet mustard slaw from the Punks plate. Although she is a mayo loving, mustard hating individual, she said she likes this slaw better than regular slaw.

DEFINITELY ON THE TO DO LIST IF YOU HAVE TIME IN PHOENIX."}
{"text":"I dream about their chopped salad...I, too, would use it as my screen saver if I didn't share a computer."}

So I foolishly wait & wait... and it finally arrives: stone cold, and with FAKE grill marks. Manager totally ignores the situation right in front him. Will avoid Cowboy Ciao forever, and calling health dept tomorrow. Suggest you go elsewhere too...

PS - Madeleine French Cafe next door had a super quick (and tasty!) grilled ham & cheese sandwich for 1/2 the cost that a scarfed-up as I was running to my gate."}

{"text":"For my last meal I will come here. The cocktails, Stetson salad and any one of the apps or entrees.  3rd visit here in 2 years.  Obviously had the Stetson salad, split a rib eye special that included veggies and mashed potatoes, also ordered a bottle of wine that our server helped us select.  The rib eye was exactly medium rare and the coffee spice/rub was delicious.  We were stuffed, so full.  But then the server mentioned the bread pudding and that the chef has recently changed the recipe.  Ok, well, just a bite.  Or two. Or six.  

Thanks for an incredible meal, a truly helpful waiter and just a fun evening.  See you next time we're back for Spring Training, and Go Giants!"}
{"text":"Yum! This place is getting a five star BEFORE my food gets here. The owner/chef is on the cover of his menu. Hottttt. 

So far, I've had a margarita and his picture is looking even better. Yum! I'll post a picture of his menu's cover page. You can see for yourself.  Margarita is pretty good too! 

The waitress, Maria, super sweet. Fantastic service. She's very helpful in helping me decide what to order. I've ordered the Burrata Insalata with chicken. I'll update my review and let you know how it tastes.


Update:

The Burrata salad is delicious!!!! You get a generous portion of real ooie-gooie Burrata, seasoned to perfection. Cherry tomatoes, arugula, avocado topped with crispy onions. I ordered with chicken. Everything is seasoned well, you can eat them separately or combine them. Either way, delicious.  Cowboy Ciao definitely makes this airport wait time a pleasure. 

It doesn't hurt that the chef is a hottie and his picture is on the menu."}
{"text":"Cowboy Ciao came highly recommended by one of the boy's coworkers.  The decor is cowboy chic.  We had reservations but they were packed so we waited at the bar.  The bartender was friendly and funny and we enjoyed our yummy cocktails.  Once we were seated we both started with the mac and cheese which is more like mac & cheese pie.  It definitely was a little spicy which I enjoyed.  I had the pork pudding which was delicious - I definitely was in the mood to be a little fatty that night.  He had the mushroom pan fry which also very good.  We left full and a little buzzed and ready to get our drink on."}
{"text":"Okay I stopped by here this morning with well over an hour before my flight and got to the terminal just minutes after the door was already closed. 

Two hostesses this... One named Monique I believe. Both had attitudes with the customers and their coworkers. 

It took forever to get service and I got up to leave... Then the server rushed over like a police dog. I ordered a simple breakfast... The cook brought that out in only a few minutes. The server brought my orange juice about 12 minutes later. 

While eating, a guy (20's?) shows up with two girls and Monique is no place to be found. Next thing I notice is him feverishly picking his nose and 'flinging' the 'catch of the day' out onto the restaurant floor as well as at passing by travelers. Now that's class!! The girls with him were not phased by the incident. 

The food I ordered tasted ok... Much like Waffle House except higher priced. It was next to impossible for me to find the server for the check. Monique was out if range as well. 

By the time I was able to chase this lunatic down and pay for my food I was late for the plane. Thankfully a little information got me on the plane. 

Won't be going back to this place!"}
{"text":"Just finished a great dinner at Cowboy Ciao. The chopped salad; a house specialty has more ingredients than I can list here but the mix made for a great starter.

The Scallop main course was Excellent!  And one of our friend got the Filet Mignon and said it was also excellent! 
Both Deserts, Peach Bread Pudding and Chocolate Panna Cotta were delicious!  
I would try them again when it was NOT restaurant week!!"}

Worst restaurant experience of my life.

Can't cook a hamburger! Brought back same one three times!!

Will never go back - walked out without eating."}
{"text":"Cowboy Ciao was one of my favorite Arizona Restaurant Week places to date. They put out a solid menu with some fantastic options and they know that Restaurant Week should be at least a little bit of a deal. (I hate restaurants that just toss three items on their menu that would've added up to $29 anyway.)

I had the fried mac & cheese which was delicious, topped off with a fantastic tomato-chile-salsa type thing. My only complaint here is that it was just this side of not-warm-enough. (The Mac, not the chile stuff, which isn't supposed to be hot.) 

I also had a good several bites of the girlfriend's Stetson Chopped Salad. I understand the hype. It's at once fresh, crispy, and packed with flavor--it's more an experience than a salad. Absolutely perfect and beautiful to boot.

The scallops with beet risotto were just fantastic. The goat cheese was a masterstroke, the scallops were cooked absolutely perfectly, and the dish was just the right size for a three course--three large-ish scallops. The risotto was tasty though it could've used just a little something to perk it up, but the goat cheese did some fantastic heavy lifting on that front. Absolutely awesome.

Finally, the banana cream pudding/pie and the bread pudding. Both hit  the spot, but the banana cream felt a little less special, if that makes sense. The bread pudding was fantastic, but definitely a heavy dish after such a meal. 

Overall, a great experience, though they're a touch on the pricey side... regardless, we'll be back... those scallops were too delicious to ignore."}
{"text":"Mark and I decided to drop in for a late afternoon drink, thinking it might be fun to try since we have enjoyed the sister bar Kazimierz. Wow, were we disappointed! We ordered a Who's Your Trinidaddy? and another drink (I can't remember it's obnoxious name) and both were AWFUL!! I had bronchitis earlier this winter and these drinks reminded me of the cough syrup I took every night. Steer clear of this place that is trying sooooo hard to be cool, yet falls flat on it's face."}
{"text":"We have been to Cowboy Ciao several times before and the food is always excellent.  The food deserves 5 stars but because of the bad experience we had last night I can't give the restaurant 5 stars! 
My boyfriend had some co-workers in town so the four of us went for dinner on Friday night.  From the very beginning we experienced lackluster service.  We tried to order Nickolasha shots (which I highly recommend!) while we waited for our counterparts to arrive but we couldn't seem to catch the waiters attention.  We waited so long, we considered going to the bar to order them instead.  Actually the only time the waiter was prompt was when the check arrived, he hurriedly brought it to the table while we still had full glasses of wine and wine in the bottle making no mention of \"taking our time\" with the bill.  He then refused to split the bills between us saying this was something that \"can't be done\", but rather he could only split the amount between two cards which I found strange. (And in the end after we asked again he ended up splitting it so clearly it COULD be done in the first place if he was so inclined). 
Truly though these were all minor infractions that I probably would not have noticed or cared about if an entire glass of ice water had not been spilled on my boyfriend and I. 
Prior to our dinner arriving another waitress was refilling our glasses and dumped a glass of ice water in our laps.  I don't blame her, it was an honest mistake and she was truly mortified. 
HOWEVER, nothing was offered to us period.  Not a free drink, discount, etc. I have never experienced something like this, especially at such a high end restaurant.  Our waiter didn't even offer his apologies.  For that reason alone I will be hesitant to visit in the future.  
But as I mentioned before the food is a 5/5. 
FOOD: 
Stetson Salad- a MUST order, our friends could not stop raving about it. 
Mini Mushroom Pan Fry- Good vegetarian dish, the half is a full serving! 
Meatloaf and Mashed Potatoes- Very flavorful, I normally don't eat a lot of meat but I couldn't stop stealing bites off of my boyfriends plate!!"}
{"text":"The Stetson Salad and the Mushroom dish make this place worth coming to. 

Sadly every time ive come here ive had to deal with some sour pretentious staff that thinks their shit don't stink.

Great spot for a quick bite and then bail."}
{"text":"By the time I ate here, I was totally cynical of all Scottsdale restaurants and was really thinking about having my lunch at In-N-Out.  

I got off to a really bad start at this place, too, they made me wait for a table at this half empty restaurant.  Which was okay, I guess, because D. Frank Designs is across the street.   Anyway, I come back, the sweet little hostess girl has my table ready, but the poor girl is limping because she fell at home the night before and hurt her knee!!  She even shows me the damage!  So, I guess it's okay that I had to wait a bit.  I mean the poor working girl is maimed!!!

So, wouldn't you know, she sits me in front of a window and it's hot as blazes there.  Geez.  So, I complain to my delightful servers Byran and Melia.  Yes, I get two servers.  I think they can easily identify a tough customer at this joint.  I quickly identified them as Mutt & Jeff.  So, Byran says he will tamper with my ventilation and I think, ya right.  But right away, it gets cooler and so do I.  

Anyway, this place has \"Republic of Tea\" tea.  You can't go wrong with any establishment that serves Republic of Tea.  I'm getting stoked now.  So, anyway, I check out the menu and can't decide what I want.  I mean, I'm starving, but I'm not that hungry.  Bryan convinces me to try the Stetson.  He says that if I don't love it, he will take it back and get me something else.  He says that no one has ever sent back the salad.  That's a challenge I can't pass up on.  So, I've finally made up my mind and then that wonderful Melia  comes out with some incredible hummus, fresh chopped salsa and spinach tortillas to tide me over until my salad come.  The flavors were so amazing together!  So fresh and delicious!

Next comes my Stetson Salad.  I don't need to describe it, because every yelp-er before me has done an excellent job.  But you don't know how really amazing this salad is until you try one yourself.  It is so incredibly good.  It's the first and only time that I have ever finished any salad anywhere.  It was so amazing.

Anyway, the sad part for me was that this was my last meal in Scottsdale.  And it was just lunch.  I wish I would have eaten here sooner and I wish I could have experienced dinner.  I will be back.  And Cowboy Ciao will be my first stop next time.

One of the things that I think sets this place apart, (besides the interesting food),  is the incredible service.  I felt like I was visiting Bryan's and Melia's and they were there to take care of me.  It's a very friendly place, I love that!!"}
{"text":"Very bad bad bad service, bad bad bad attitude and bad food. Disgrace of Phoenix or more."}
{"text":"I have been here for dinner twice and both times I'm completely satisfied with my meal.

The food: Of course I got the chopped salad.  It's just fantastic, and I wish I lived closer to Scottsdale so that I could eat it on a regular basis (note to self: try to make my own at home....).  My entre was the filet (I got it both times I was there) and both times it was perfectly cooked.  For desert I shared the peanut butter brownie.  It was apparently voted the best desert of 2010 by Phoenix Magazine, but I wasn't overly impressed by it.  It was good, but not the best.  (the chopped salad would make a great desert)

Trying to get a table: the first time we had reservations, and no issues sitting a group of 9.  The second time, a Tuesday night this year, I failed to make a reservation because I didn't think it would be busy... it was a Tuesday night after all.  Well I had to wait 45 minutes for a table for 2.  We finally got seated at 8pm.

So lesson learned, no matter what day of the week, just make a reservation... and get the chopped salad no matter what!

8.9.12 - Figured I should add more to my review.... I still love this restaurant and it is still my absolute favorite place to eat in Scottsdale.

My friends and I went here recently with an out of town guest.  Of course I got the chopped salad to start out with (sharing with a friend).  Still fantastic and a requirement if you ever go.  For dinner I had the pork chop.  I generally don't order pork chops and didn't really grow up eating them... whenever I had one before it was bland and dry.  Cowboy Ciao though made the best pork chop of my life.  A month later I'm still craving it.  It was about half an inch thick, perfectly cooked and juicy.  Amazing.

For desert we ordered a bunch of items.  The cobbler and the donuts were great and I ordered the ice cream sampler.  The flavors I chose were duck fat buttercream, smoked chocolate, and spicy caramel.  I think I was the only one who liked the smoked chocolate, but I also love the taste of liquid smoke.  The duck fat was the most unusual and the least favorite.  Left a weird after taste.  The caramel was good, but not spicy enough.

Also, we ordered this cocktail that had a deviled egg as a garnish.  Amazing.  Just order it."}
{"text":"High expectations, bad awful service, I sat down waitress came by took my order and that was the last I saw her. Didn't order a 5 course meal, just a burger . Come to find out my order was given to someone else..30 minutes later no food-unfortunate....what a total waste of my time!"}
{"text":"Pretty good spot to grab lunch at the American Airline Terminal B. 

I got the testosterone steak - arugula salad with blue cheese dressing and blue cheese topped with medium cooked steak. $20 but that's regular airport food price. 

I was pretty satisfied after eating this salad. Super friendly service!"}
{"text":"I was in Scottsdale for business meetings and a group of us wanted to try something a bit different. We were pleasantly surprised. The service was first rate, our waiter was very knowledgeable and helpful with questions. Everyone loved the food, and the drinks were tasty too. Recommended!"}
{"text":"I came here because of the chopped salad pictures I saw in other reviews.  We went on a saturday for lunch.  I ordered the cowboy ciao signature chopped salad and my partner ordered a burger.  The salad came out and looked beautiful only a lot smaller than I thought.  Ingredients were nice and the best part was that you could actually eat it with a spoon!!  That is the way a choppped salad should be..Warning, if you are really hungry, this chopped salad is probably not going to be enough to satisfy..  Service was good, however, I thought this restaurant was too pricey.  My partner ordered a burger and asked for bacon and cheese on it...this ended up costing a total of $17 for a burger... Overall: Food: 4, Service: 4, Value: 2.. should be 3.5 stars .."}
{"text":"Funky restaurant, great food!  My wife and I have been dreaming about the chopped salad.  Remarkable!"}
{"text":"Simply the worst service I can remember.  Made a reservation for 7 on a Sunday morning.  When we arrived there were 3 other tables seated.  The waitress was cold, at best - no smile, no welcome - but we were having a celebration so we let it go.  She took the drink order - 4 cocktails, 3 sodas - the sodas came out in a reasonably quick time, the cocktails took almost 30 minutes.  Mind you, there are only 3 other tables at this point.  
We were already a little crabby about the super long wait for the drinks and the waitress who hadn't smiled once, so as the food is being delivered, by the manager, he put my plate down in front of my husband, I picked it up to move it in front of me, the manager says \"hands off lady, I'm handling the plates\" a cheeky comment, which wouldn't have been offensive had he bothered to smile at all.  My son took offense and went over to talk to him and he was rude, defensive and did not apologize.  The waitress continued to be cold and acted like she didn't know we were upset.  When we finally got the check, we put $0 in the tip line because we had had terrible service.  On my cc statement they had added a $42 tip for themselves.  I am disputing with my CC company. 

Sadly, the food was great.  Nothing is worse than having the kitchen staff do an amazing job and the front of the house staff ruin it. 

This was our 5th visit to Cowboy Caio and our last."}
{"text":"I have eaten here twice, and can say it is easily some of the best food in Phoenix.  (I would eat there a lot more often, but it's a long ways from the Northwest Valley).  
You MUST get the chopped salad, it really is THAT GOOD.
The scallop appetizer may have been the best scallops I've ever eaten.  Our table had ordered one or two of these to share.  Do not make the same mistake.  Order it for yourself, if someone else wants it, tell them to get their own damn order.  Next time I may just order these for my entree.
We also really like the halibut.
The drink menu is very creative, too, and worth a dabble."}
{"text":"6:30 on a Saturday night - the place was ~40% full. It was fancier than I thought it would be - people were wearing business casual/smart and dresses. I felt underdressed in my t-shirt and jean shorts.

My friends and I ordered 3 dishes to share. Buffalo Carpaccio, Stetson chopped salad and Mushroom Pan Fry. They were all about ~$12-15. The Stetson Salad was the best dish by far. It looked pretty, all of the ingredients lined up, colorful - there was some crunch to it. I would definitely order the salad again.

For a bunch of soft-spoken girls, we were unable to hear each other over the loud chatter at cowboy ciao. As the night went on, the restaurant was completely full by 8pm."}
{"text":"I've been here many many times before and have had an excellent experience. But unfortunately this last time was far from amazing. Our server seemed very\"put out\" about any questions that we may have had and was snotty through out the dinner. Being a fellow service industry person I would expect more. Maybe he was having a bad day 

Such a shame!"}
{"text":"The Stetson chopped salad with smoked salmon was such a unique mix of equally balanced tasty ingredients. Delicious! Even to-go. It would have been 5 stars if it weren't $13 for a salad... But it's still worth it to let your taste buds indulge in this experience that you can't find in a salad anywhere else!"}
{"text":"The steak sandwich is one of the best I have ever had....hands down. 
Be warned- Its not actually a \"sandwich\", it's a petite filet served open faced on a thick cut slice of bread...not your typical sandwich style. But oh my God, it's to die for. I will definitely be stopping back here before my next flight out of Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Great food and it's in an airport!  Normally, airport food really sucks.  Even the cheesy brand names like TGIF and Wolfgang Puck are crappy at the airport.  I've never heard of this place before until I was in Phoenix on a stop over last week.   It's turns out it's a chain.  When I looked at the menu I was a little skeptical about spending $14 for a filet steak sandwich especially with $4 hamburger just down the hall but I decided to try it anyway.

I may must say I was really impressed.  This place is not just good for an airport, it's on par with upscale places anywhere. The quality of the food, the temperature and presentation were all top notch.  The only thing I would suggest is when you offer someone a glass of Cabernet tell them it's $13.  Other than that I have no complaints and look forward to me next stopover."}
{"text":"This review was based on one visit.  I showed up and was immediately seated.  I literally had 35 minutes before my plane was scheduled to board so I informed my server when he showed up after a few minutes.  He assured me that my food would be out of the kitchen in less than 10 minutes.

I ordered the Rueben sandwich which was different because it contained brined beef rib meat instead of pastrami.  It included some stuff that I didn't want on it but it was served an marbled rye bread.  The sandwich was good and creative.  The rest of the menu appeared to be creative as well.

I didn't have a drink but there is a bar there that is quite large.  I did have good service from TJ and was happy that I was able to make it out in time.  The prices were fair for an airport restaurant.  Four stars!"}
{"text":"Really good for an airport. I got the mac and cheese and it was great. I will be back."}
{"text":"Awesome food, awesome drinks, awesome staff.  We always enjoy our visit to Cowboy Ciao.  It's good to see a restaurant that can focus on the food as much as it focus's on it's ambiance.  It's probably a good thing that it's not on the canal because I feel those restaurants simply charge a high price to make you feel like you are getting something exclusive but in reality you are getting an average meal.  With the exception of Olive and Ivy which is great for the patio.  Regardless we will keep coming back to Cowboy Ciao."}
{"text":"The berkshire pork belly is greasy, fatty, fried and yes, fantastic! Totally worth every calorie. I can skip dessert to eat this. Easily!"}
{"text":"Heard a lot of good hype on this place, so 6 of us went for a 40th bday.  Service was very slow and by the time we ordered, they were out of two or 3 three things on the menu on a Thursday night.  A few more service mishaps ensued.  Food was okay but expected more."}
{"text":"Have eaten here a couple of times now since stumbling upon it at the airport. First meal, the crazy signature burger that you should never eat all of, but can't stop yourself. Second meal, the mushroom pan fry that you should never eat all of, but can't stop yourself. Come hungry. Service is friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful date night here with the lova! We really enjoyed their flights they have to choose from. Lover went with a pinot flight and i went with the \"Best in Bubbles\" flight...mmmmm i love champagne.
Service was very good. Our server was on the ball and  knew his stuff when it came to the menu. We shared the filet mignon and the fish and everything was very good. 

It is a very popular place so make reservations so you're not waiting around! just a friendly tip from yours truly."}
{"text":"The hostess was so rude! Sorry we didn't see the \"wait to be seated sign\", the staff was standing in front of it talking! We only wanted a drink, and an appetizer, not a meal - so we were heading toward the bar. Instead of nicely saying hello would you like a table  - she rudely says \"table\" and snarls at us. No hello or any greeting, just walks us to the table and then throws the menus down and walks away! So I said - oh thanks - sorry we missed your sign! I got the look of death. The waiter was nice enough - the menu was boring and pricey. Didn't even bother with an appetizer after that hostess treated us like dirt. 20 bucks for a glass of wine, a beer and a Sprite! I know it's the airport but really?!?!?"}
{"text":"This was a great place for lunch. I had the Stetson chop salad with smoked salmon because so many Yelpers recommended it. No disappointment. Would go again. My husband had the same dish but had chicken in his mix."}
{"text":"On a business trip with the wifey and was recommended this restaurant. For some reason, we were told that the food was \"inventive.\" Well, not to us it wasn't. Had a chopped salad that looked and tasted like a child had made it. Wife had burrata salad, which tasted like nothing inventive whatsoever and again, was presented as a downright ugly looking plate, with torn bits of dried bread over a few wilted arugula leaves and a glob of burrata on one side. Hideous. Wifey liked her scallops, but again, nothing special. My Korean ribs were too salty. Wifey had olive cake, again, proclaimed it very \"average.\" Wine list was extensive, which was a plus, but we ended up with just a couple of glasses of Schramsberg - were not in the mood to go big, with food that simplistic and boring. We will never come here again if we find ourselves in Scottsdale - no finesse whatsoever."}
{"text":"My husband and I were in Scottsdale to visit my sister, and her boyfriend Barry suggested that we eat at Cowboy Ciao.  He had told us about the Stetson chopped salad and how good it was.  Well he wasn't exaggerating.  It was absolutely delicious.  This IS the best salad I ever had.  The service is excellent and the prices are very reasonable.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Pretty good spot in the Phoenix Airport. I ordered the Exotic Mushroom Pan Fry and was pretty pleased with the overall taste. A whole slew of different types of mushrooms in a savory brown gravy with avacado and polenta. 
The menu had some interesting/unique fare which I really like. I would definitely come back to try their breakfast enchiladas and a number of items on their 'grazing' section. 
The staff was friendly and fast, too. Overall, I'm a happy and full traveler."}
{"text":"I read the reviews. Heard good things. Was excited to try it. It was just ok. Wouldn't return. Pretty limited menu. Disappointing selections. Split the chopped salad and Reuben. Meat was very fatty and huge chunks. Hard to eat."}
{"text":"How to Have a Good Time at Cowboy Ciao:

1) Order the Stetson chopped salad. 

2) Finish it.

3) Order the Peanut Butter Brownie Upside Downy. 
(Note: DO NOT question whether you're full or not. It doesn't matter).

4) Finish it."}
{"text":"We came for Morhers Day brunch yesterday and while the food was good, everyone seemed to enjoy their food, but we had a couple little problems. First, our waitress was completely overworked and most things had to be asked for many times. Not her fault, I think they just didn't plan well in staffing. The second kind if irks me a little. When I sat down, I was last to arrive since I brought one of my little people with me, the waitress said, \"We have complimentary mimosas today for all the moms. Can I get you one?\"  Well of course!  When I was only half way through she asked if I would like another. Of course I would!  Same with the third and whole they weren't great mimosas, I figure you get what you pay for. Free mimosa = just ok mimosa. Anyway, we get our bill and the first mimosa was free. Each subsequent mimosa wa $8!  I have no problem paying for my mimosas but these were average at best. I left feeling bamboozled."}
{"text":"Overall we were quite pleased with Cowboy Ciao.  The food was really good for the most part, we ordered a few small plates and shared.  Our favorites were the truffle oil mac & cheese, the mini mushroom pan fry (not very appealing to look at, but tastes awesome!) and the Ahi Tuna Tartare.  Least favorite was the Berkshire Pork Belly, it was basically a few pieces of fat (maybe this is just the cut, but I've had pork belly numerous times before and this was really fatty).  Service was pretty good.  

We made a reservation online, we were hoping for around 7PM but all that was available was 6:15...well there was barely anyone there the entire time that we were there (from 6:15 until 7:30 or so), so I'm unsure why we couldn't just make the reservation for 7?  Also, the decor is nice, but it didn't really match the cuisine, we felt somewhat of a disconnect in that department.  

I'd go back because 3 out of 4 of our dishes were really good!"}
{"text":"Looks like a shady Mexican restaurant. Service is about that same level at the bar. If it's possible to be blind folded, served better than you will enjoy. The food is great, but everything else is busted."}
{"text":"If you're not at the bar the service is painfully slow when packed. However this is a good spot to pass up time in the airport. They have drink specials, I enjoyed the buy a single make it a double for 1/2 off! The food menu looked great, everyone's food that was coming out smelled and looked so dang good. I wouldn't hesitate to come back but I'll definitely sit at the bar."}
{"text":"I ordered the Exotic Mushroom Pan Fry and was hugely disappointed. Some of the mushrooms were so chewy it seemed like they are a month old. The sauce was delicious but the polenta at the bottom of the dish was bland and introduced a weird flavor that didn't fit with the overall dish. It felt like crustini or some other type of crunch would have complemented the dish better. Also the freshly chopped tomatoes and the avocado slices - they don't quite mix up with the flavor of the mushrooms. Weird.
Overall - C for effort."}
{"text":"The food was excellent--we had the Stetson chopped salad, buffalo carpaccio, exotic mushroom pan fry, and the lamb. All well-prepared and delicious.

To move up to 5-star quality, they need to improve the service and ambiance. It was very loud for such a nice place--very difficult to hear our server. I think she had trouble hearing us too, which may have caused a couple of mix-ups and delays with our drink and food orders. She was very polite about the problems, but it took a bit away from the experience."}
{"text":"I had the worst experience I've ever had at a restaurant here. Our waiter ignored us and flirted with a few young woman at the bar. When we got there our waiter took our order. He seemed to be not listening or the incredible noise around us might have played a role. ( my husband and I couldn't even talk to each other it was that loud. There was even a woman whistling like at a sporting arena at the table behind us a calling across the room) after 20 minutes he brings a steak knife to our table and doesn't even explain why our wine wasn't delivered yet and didn't make eye contact. He then continued to flirt with the girls. After another 10 minutes we left telling the hostess who didn't have any reaction other than ok. I will be telling everyone I know about this experience."}
{"text":"After week of coordinating with a newly created yelp - foodie group, we decided that our first visit will be at Cowboy Ciao. I haven't been to CC for over 10 years, and I am glad I came back.
Our server, Nancy was amazing, funny, and on point at all times. She did mention it was restaurant week, but we mentioned her what we were there for and she had some recommendations for us.
Our group shared the truffle mac and cheese, mushroom pan fry, pork chop, pork belly, and the flat iron steak.
Nancy was very diligent making sure we pair our food perfectly. First came out the pork belly and the truffle mac and cheese. Every bite was delicious and went well with each other.
Second came our main plates: flat iron steak, pork chops, and the mushrooms. I would go back just for the mushrooms alone and the sauce. 

I decided to wash down this decadent food with the wine flight CC was offering. 

I would definitely recommend this place for an intimate date night. You cannot go wrong.

And a huge thanks to our server Nancy!!!"}
{"text":"We went to Cowboy Ciao for the first time last evening and the food definitely did not impress.  We started with two appetizers, the quesadilla of the day and the squash soup.  The quesadilla was made with filet but there was so much cumin in the concoction that was all you could taste.  It was also pretty spicy.  Overall, not enjoyable.

As to the squash soup, it was also extra spicy and full of cumin.  I guess there must have been a sale on cumin at the spice warehouse.  Instead of a nice bright golden or yellowish color, as is typical for squash soup, this was a dark brown.

We then shared the mushroom specialty.  It was just so-so.  Yes, there are a lot of mushrooms.  But, surprisingly, since our other dishes had been overly spiced, this one was pretty bland.  We asked for some salt (which arrived immediately) and with a dash of salt, one was able to enjoy the flavors much better.

On the other hand, I should note that the service was excellent.  The staff was friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Generally speaking, restaurants in airports is marginal to poor. So when you find one that is truly good it's worth sharing.
Cowboy Ciao restaurant in the Sky Harbor airport is worth the effort!
I had the open face filet sandwich and my wife had the chile pork bacon avocado Waygu burger. Both were excellent.
Great service from Justin!
A must stop"}
{"text":"If the Stetson chopped salad was the only thing we ordered, I would have walked away raving about this restaurant and give it 5 stars. But, we ordered the mini mushroom appetizer-way too heavy palenta for starter and the pastrami short ribs as main course. Was expecting them to melt in my mouth, afraid not! Dry, over seasoned, did I say dry and over seasoned. Waitress was great. Will only return for the salad."}
{"text":"The chopped salad is the best around. End.Of.Story. I loved this place so much I've recreated the Chopped Salad recipe so I can have it here in St. Louis too! Will always come when we visit Arizona!"}
{"text":"So this has been one of the best meals I've ever had, yet I have some constructive criticism. 
PROS:
1. The food is to DIE FOR. The Stenson salad is delicious and the perfect appetizer to split. The truffle mac and cheese is so gooey, i wish there was more of it to share. I had the special, which was a 20 oz. ribeye steak. IT WAS HUGE. Also came with asparagus and this great mashed potatoes. It was seasoned perfectly, it wasnt till halfway through they give you some delicious sauce to pour all on it. Yet, you really dont need it! 
2. The servers are very friendly and well seasoned employees, they DEFINITELY know what youre talking about. 
3. They do wine flights? Need I say more? Plus, they have one of the most eccentric wine lists, it would take you at least an hour just to read each one. Some offered only by the bottle. 
4. They gave me a free shot for my birthday, delicious. 
------------------------
CONS: 
1. The layout of the place, its kind of cramped, especially when you are trying to maneuver around people trying to get to the bathroom.
2. The food service, while amazing, was slow. For 2 appetizers and 3 entrees being ordered at the same time, the entire service took 3 hours. It was fine for our party, but not suggested if you are in a rush. 
3. A litttttle on the pricey side, while the food was amazing, you cant get an entree and an appetizer for under 50 dollars per person here. Just to warn you, then again, it IS scottsdale. 

TIP:
Make a reservation. On a tuesday night, there wasnt one empty table in sight. people were sitting at the bar just to get some time of meal service. 

One of my new favorite american places!"}
{"text":"The word \"perfect\" can been defined as, \"having all the required or desirable elements, qualities, or characteristics; as good as it is possible to be.\"

Based on that definition, the Stetson Chopped Salad at Cowboy Ciao is \"perfect\"!  If I was a salmon, then ending up in this salad would be the perfect ending to my life.  Ok, that sounds a little weirder to read that it did when it was in my head... but the point is that this salad is absolutely \"to die for.\"  For salmon, that is. 

The Berkshire Pork Belly comes crispy confit style with roasted Brussels sprouts, shallots, toasted almonds, cheese, and a Oaxacan chile honey drizzle.  I don't have to tell you how good that sounds, just go back and read those ingredients again.  Seriously, I'll wait... go read them again.  Pork Belly makes me smile...

Needless to say, the Pork Belly also came close to being perfect!  But... even if the Pork Belly was not perfect, the excellent friendly, timely, and attentive service made this entire experience truly perfect. 

Way to go, Cowboy Ciao!  In the words of the Governator, I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Ok, I don't normally sit down at a computer to write a five star review for an airport restaurant. I'm generally lucky if I remember what I ate at an airport, much less to Yelp about it. 

That being said, the Stetson Salad I had at Cowboy Ciao has me hoping for a layover in Phoenix next time I travel out west!

The over-the-top friendly server told me this would be an all-time salad to try, and after a week of eating, well, NOT salads, I figured it couldn't hurt. 

They promptly brought it out for me, and it was not like any salad I'd had before. Each ingredient was set in its own line: roasted dry sweet corn, pupitas, arugula, Israeli cous-cous, bruschetta tomatoes and I added chicken.

I don't know if it was my body ravenously craving real ingredients after a week of debauchery, but this salad hit the damn spot! I couldn't eaten two of them.

Anyhow, I can't attest to one other thing on the menu but I highly recommend you order this. I may even try to make something similar to re-create it one of these days."}
{"text":"People below who wrote ho-hum reviews.... you do realize that this is inside of SkyHarbor, right?  Quite frankly, the food is good enough to compare with some of the better food I've had in Arizona, all while having to deal with HMSHost and TSA!

I definitely recommend coming by if you've got a layover."}
{"text":"Came here last night for a bday party. Have heard about this place over the years so it was time to try!

Started with the Ciabatta bread (you have to pay for bread...insert roll of eyes) but nonetheless it was very good! Lots of garlic and olive oil on it!

I ordered the filet, medium and basically asked for a blank plate with a filet. I wasnt interested in the veggies or other items that came with it. When the food came out, of course garnish and all on it. I didnt make it a big deal but was just annoying I specifically told them to not have that on my plate. Steak was good, not City hall/Steak 44 good but still a good piece of meat. 

Server was so nice and it was his bday as well that night. He brought a piece of cake and candle for the bday girl which was a nice gesture (I dont think we asked). 

Overall, a good spot. It wont be on my top 5 list or major recommendation but i would return"}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants in Arizona. Stetson chopped salad and mushroom pan-fry are MUSTS. The Chopped Salad at Cowboy Ciao is so famously delish, that It has it's own website!. The food is little pricey but worth it."}
{"text":"I came here with a friend for Restaurant week last Saturday night. The restaurant week deal is amazing, the meal I had would have been extremely expensive had it not been RW and I got to try a variety of menu items. I had to try the Stetson Chop Salad, as it is the signature dish... it was pretty delish. I liked all of the different flavors and textures, it was sweet, herbacious, salty, crunchy, chewy....pretty much a little bit of everything. I then had the scallops... very tasty, crunchy scallops served over a bacon risotto... I would definitely get this again. For an entree I had the lamb lollipops... these were good, but a little overcooked (they were supposed to be medium rare and were more like medium well...). I wouldn't get this again. My friend had the pastrami short rib, which was tasty, but a little odd. I probably wouldn't order that either. The desserts were nothing special.... we had the hawaiian bread pudding, which was dry, and the peanut butter bar, which was good but lacked any creativity. I would go back for the scallops and that delicious chopped salad!"}
{"text":"Sky Harbor has upped their food game. Cowboy Ciao offers the perfect on airplane meal - chopped salad! I got the  chopped salad (which, I have to say is very expensive, more than at the real restaurant I think.... 14$), and took it on my looong flight to Boston. Halfway through the flight, I had the pleasure of eating this delicious mix of textures, flavors, and temperatures. I would recommend this if you  are hungry at the airport."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite spots in the Valley! I used to live in Scottsdale, so anytime I come back \"home\" I make sure to make a quick stop at Cowboy Ciao for their Stetson Chopped Salad. I always get the same thing, because you can't mess with perfection. Trust me - it's absolutely phenomenal. I typically get the salad with smoked salmon, but they also offer a vegetarian option (served with avocado) and a chicken option. You really can't go wrong with any of them. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Wow, this place is good. Excellent combination of flavors, very unique. The Chop Salad is super-awesome, buffalo carpaccio is delicious. The Wine list is huge... over-whelming really. They know how not to over-cook the salmon, and the pork-chop is great too. Service is top notch. Big thumbs up for this place. I go every time I'm in town. Get reservations on weekends. Mondays-Tuesdays are easy to walk-in."}
{"text":"I mostly enjoyed my meal at Cowboy Ciao. It started a bit rough. I made a Sunday evening reservation, to celebrate an anniversary. We were promptly seated, given a lunch and dinner menu. This led to confusion initially, then mild frustration when it took our server over 10 minutes to come see us. My date and I  decided on a Bottle of martinelli's cider, and a glass of champagne for her. I requested the champagne be poured in a red wine glass, because she'd be adding the cider to it. A bit of an unusual request, but far from difficult I thought. I also mentioned very clearly to the server that I was not drinking. AND I said, word for word while making eye contact, 'I don't drink'. He returned 10 minutes later with 2 empty red wine glasses. 5 minutes later he brought a flute with champagne, and a bottle of alcoholic cider. I poured some without looking closely, then caught the smell of alcohol. I flagged him down with some difficulty, and explained that he brought something other than what we ordered, and mentioned again that I don't drink, while pointing at the label showing '9% alcohol by volume'. He was completely confused. He said something like 'oh, I forgot to mention this alternative suggestion.' I then asked him to please bring the Martinelli's we ordered, and a second dinner menu (I had mentioned that problem earlier as well). 

He returned fairly promptly with the right bottle. The rest of the meal service was mostly uneventful, the server was semi awkward but attentive. He kept saying 'I just want to check with you that the (salad/appetizer/entree) is ok' . I had the lamb - very GOOD but not great, she had the pork chop -  GREAT. 

I don't see myself retuning, there are better options nearby. And please Cowboy Ciao, remind your staff that serving someone alcohol when they say they don't drink is uncomfortable. I think this was just a factor of him not listening, which is unpleasant."}
{"text":"To be frank I was disappointed with the food. I expected better even though it was in an airport. The presentation of the chopped salad was unimpressive. There was hardly any salad dressing so it was dry. I ordered chicken and paid $2 extra for avocado and there was hardly any chicken or avocado. All and all it was a small forgettable overpriced salad. It wasn't bad, just small, dry, & bland. The diet coke was refreshing and the best part of the $25 meal."}
{"text":"Had the Chicken Wrap last Thursday for dinner and within twelve hours I unfortunately had food poisoning."}
{"text":"I stopped by their \"to go\" bar to pick up an in flight dinner on my way to Detroit. The \"Stetson Chopped\" (vs. chopped Sterson - ew!) salad caught my eye. You can get beef, chicken or salmon. Last time I checked, PHX is a ways from the ocean even if it is an airport. So, I went with the chicken. Very nice! Well seasoned, so I didn't use more than half the accompanying dressing. Expensive for what it is($14.25) but average pricing for an airport. 

The salad had chicken, corn, arugula, pumpkin or squash seeds, and other chopped up stuff. Best to check out the photo I uploaded with this review. 

In the end, especially with the quick and courteous service, I decided this is a place to remember positively at PHX, which has not been a happy food hunting ground for me the other 100 or so times I've been there."}
{"text":"The salad is what they are famous for an its no wonder why! They toss it in front of you with the dressing and this salad is like no other. I have tried to order other items off the menu but always come back to the salad. Which is saying a lot! I get it the classic way with the smoked salmon! Yummy!"}
{"text":"The Stetson Chopped Salad gets 5 stars.  Have to have it at least once per visit each year I'm in Scottsdale for Spring Training.  And, it is so easy to make at home.  An added plus - this year we ate at the bar.  When I ordered a third glass of champagne the pour, from the end of the bottle, was about an inch shy of full.  So, the bartender comp'ed it. :)"}
{"text":"The location is fantastic! And I know it's been around for a long time. This is my first time there. I was really looking forward to it. The service was barely OK. The food, and I tried a couple different plates, was not very good. My scallops were tough and the risotto was inedible. I also tried the mushroom dish and they were super robbery. I would not recommend this place. Sorry."}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of Cowboy Ciao.  I know a lot of people love it, but I'm just not one of them.

People love the chopped salad, but I don't care for Salmon, so I don't really care for the salad.  I did like how they present it and prepare it at the table.

The appetizers were okay.  I liked the mac and cheese the most, but most of the other people at our table didn't care for it.

My boyfriend and I split the Pastrami-rubbed filet mignon.  Neither of us liked it very much.  It was completely drenched in gravy.  You couldn't even taste the steak because of the gravy taste.

We had the peanut butter brownie for dessert.  It was okay, but definitely not worthy of a \"best dessert\" award!

The worst thing was the acoustics in the restaurant.  We had a group of 8 and we could not hear each other talking.  You literally had to yell for the person next to you to hear you.  And I gave up trying to talk to anyone from the other end of the table."}
{"text":"Some of the best airport fare I've ever had.  Creative dishes and well put together come to mind."}
{"text":"I come in for the cowboy chopped salad with chicken. It's the best I've ever had and I crave it now."}
{"text":"The staff here is so nice!! It's nice to go to a place where the staff actually know the food and highly recommend certain dishes.  And the food was delicious! The open face steak sandwich was so good!  The chicken fried pork was good, it tasted like the description. I'd highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"A person should not be asked to move because of a non existent breakfast rush, food sucks as much as the staff.
Won't return."}
{"text":"my friend and I went here during restaurant week.  It was a Saturday night and they did become busy later in the evening.  The food was fine.  My complaint is that the portion size was smaller for the restaurant week menu.  My friend ordered the extra salad and the extra dessert just to feel satisfied.  Our waitress did not tell us about the reduced portion size, I overheard her telling another table who were debating between the regular menu and restaurant week.  also my friend's  fancy drink was not prepared correctly and the waitresses excuse was the bartender does not get many requests for that drink."}
{"text":"The Stetson salad w/ smoked salmon is excellent and my husband really enjoyed it. I had the Ciao mixed greens with balsamic/ port dressing and that too was very good. They serve many dishes that I cannot eat because of the spices but if you are a person that enjoys spices Mexican than you should enjoy eating here. Neat atmosphere and friendly service."}
{"text":"This is as good as it gets for grub at the airport.  They have a distinct options for breakfast, brunch, and \"grazing\" for small and shareable bites. I had a pork over polenta with pine nuts and cranberries.  It needed a little salt but the combination was so good and satisfying.  The Rubin was also killer with great caraway and a little bit of heat.  The sandwiches come with what appear to be fresh made chips that came out piping hot.  Don't skip the local brews, Sleepy Dog Tail and the Lost Highway Black IPA.  The servers really know their food so feel free to ask questions and feel confident in their recommendations.  Not the cheapest eats in terminal 4 so if you are pinching your pennies you may want to stick with McDonald's."}
{"text":"Mark, our waiter was an absolute delight.

Resturant is beautiful. 

Drinks:

Okay

Appetizers:

Bread with cheese in a jar (sorry forgot what it was called) was delicious. 

Scallops were delicious

Mini mushroom dish with polenta I was not found of. 

Dinner: 

Filet mignon with truffle fries and special sauce, delicious. 

Chicken fried trout was not as good. There was a spice that was too much, something like cumin? 

Dessert:

Peanut butter thing is like a huge peanut butter candy cup with ice cream. 

Bread pudding i was not found of but everyone else in my party loved. 

Overall...that is some of the best food ive ever had."}
{"text":"Located in terminal 4, good luck getting waited on in the early morning. The bartender had his back turned talking to another employee. You would think with the time constrain in airport, employers would hire people with peripheral vision."}
{"text":"After finally figuring out that by some kind of insane voodoo logic, E. Stetson Dr. magically reappears after ending at Drinkwater, my special lady and I found Cowboy Ciao and the other E. Stetson Dr. and had a nice light late dinner and drinks.

It seems like every place I went had an amazing space, and CC followed suit with their sprawling dining room. After a nice warm greeting from a pair of smiling hostesses, we walked in on a Wednesday night around 10 and took a seat at the bar.

After reading some reviews on Yelp, I was intrigued, but embarrassingly, I was swayed by a picture of the 'meat and potatoes martini' in the hotel tourist magazine. This means a piece of deep-fried bacon with a potato vodka martini. I had to have this.

My dainty little girlfriend ordered some drink with strawberry aqua fresca, and I got the meat and potatoes. She got hers first, as my bacon was fried to order, and it was well-crafted, delicious, and not overly sweet.

As my drink arrived, I decided to take a sip, leaving the steaming slice of bacon perched on the glass directly beneath my nostrils. You must do this. The smoky aroma works with whatever I don't remember was in that besides vodka. Then I took a bite, and honestly, it would have to be the best aperitif one could drink. It's like an olive martini on steroids. The savory, salty, meaty, alcoholly concoction got me in the right mood.

Speaking of me drinking, I continued to do so with some of the excellent wine they offer. She got the Arizona white, and I got the Grenache. I absolutely love it when you can order medium to light bodied red wine that isn't pinot noir by the glass. Nothing against pinot, but I love creative wine programs.

Apparently, I loved it a little too much, because somehow I ended up spilling an incredible amount of red wine all over one of my favorite shirts, which happens to be baby blue. This is when George proved his meddle as a magnanimous host and savior. Seeing my faux pas, George immediately went for the wine-off and literally saved my evening. That stuff is amazing...it was like those oxy clean commericals...the red just went away. I went from buzzed happy, to incredibly embarrassed, to even more buzzed and happy in no time flat.

We ordered the famous Stetson Chopped Salad and the mac 'n' cheese to split. I never thought I would like a salad with dried corn and smoked salmon in it, but people, you owe it to yourself to try this. George was explaining how this salad was his recession-buster, and I can imagine, because it's totally unique. I have a pet peeve with overcooked pasta, so the mac wasn't my favorite, but it tasted good.

One benefit of eating a light dinner is leaving the option for dessert wide open. We capitalized on this by devouring an order of the bread pudding. A perfect portion, it melded beautifully with the cranberry compote and 5-spice ice cream, which was amazing in its own right.

I'm definitely coming back next year to try an actual entree and say what's up to George."}
{"text":"Chopped salad rocks, mushroom dish rocks. This place is the bomb."}
{"text":"OK, I actually ate here back in October and meant to write a review soon after that. Better late than never! 

This place is one of the few places at the Scottsdale waterfront area that impresses me. I think it's a gem above the Pink Taco, PF Chang-izing down there. The Stetson salad was refreshing and delectable. I was impressed by the \"air dried\" corn and the dressing didn't taste like run of the mill Caesar. Also had buffalo carpaccio for an appetizer which I hadn't had before. It was thin and flavorful. I like overall how the menu had atypical fare. I had the special, pork loin with a corn-green chili waffle. The waffle's texture was perfect--crispy outside and moist inside. 
Couldn't leave without trying the bacon chocolate chip cookies. Very filling and the bacon bits are really tiny and subtle. 

This place is good for taking a small group of family members or friends as well as date night. My mom and I had a table by the window so we could watch people walk by. Also good in that there are plenty of places to walk off the meal after! And even though it's in Snottsdale, the service was friendly and pretentious-free."}
{"text":"I love this place!  It is the number one place I recommend when friends come into town.  Great menu (love the Lamb) and the wine list is second to none!

If you haven't been, you definitely need to check this place out!"}
{"text":"Visiting from SF and this was close to my hotel.  Reservations are recommended.  We got there at 7pm on a Saturday, they estimated that we wouldn't be seated before 9:30.

We lucked out with seating at the bar, full menu.  Service was friendly and attentive.  

Very foodie friendly!!  Unusual flavor combinations -- bacon pecan brittle, candied olives -- made the meal a bit adventurous.

I had the ahi tuna antipasto and mini mushroom fry.  The ahi had a great peppery crust, served very rare with caper berries and green olives.  As a portion, this could easily be a light dinner.  The mini mushroom fry was quite decadent.  The rich and creamy sauce has a spicy bite and is best sopped up with some of their crusty ciabatta.

One item on the dessert menu immediately jumped out at me - chevre cheesecake!!  It was an incredible combination of sweet and savory, the candied olives only made it that much better.  A delicious espresso topped off the meal.

I'd definitely go again."}
{"text":"The good: excellent location, very attentive service (until, for a brief period, there was none), a spectacular wine list that was well explained and reasonable, and surprisingly, the decor, which I found unique and liked.

The bad: at the recommendation of our waiter, I had the wild boar chop, which was tough and gamey, nearly inedible. My potato salad side had undercooked potatoes and was dressed with runny mayonnaise. The green bean side was also undercooked. My colleague had (also at our waiter's recommendation) the short ribs, which he compared significantly unfavorably to a similar dish he had just had the night before at a competing establishment.

The ugly: there's eclectic, and then there's an indecipherable mess. Unfortunately, most dishes are the latter. The vaunted chopped salad, for example, is drenched in ranch dressing. Even my ten-year old, who bathes virtually any vegetable in ranch dressing, balked."}
{"text":"Do urself a favor and stop in here! I love stopping in for a salad when im in town. Get the chop salald its great! So good ill try to pick one up in the airport location heading home"}
{"text":"After reading the other Yelp reviews and talking with the concierge at Firesky, I decided to take my partner here for his birthday on Saturday.  It was an OK experience, but I'm comparing it to the standards of SF restaurants.  Our server was great and was wiling to make some recommendations to us, although she could not talk about wine or pairings.  The space was eclectic and had a good vibe, although it did seem to be a quiet weekend in Scottsdale.

The things that were disappointing were the wine experience and my partner's lamb loin.  He felt it too gamey - he's usually a big lamb lover - so he wasn't that thrilled with it.  I am a wine person but I found their wine list to be silly.  That is, to hand someone a book as large as a college text book full of wines just doesn't make sense to me.  It would take someone the entire evening to really find the wine they were looking for.  I think it's a restaurants responsibility to narrow the selection down to those selections that pair well with their food offering.  So, OK, perhaps I don't want to look through the whole list, but if you are going to throw down that kind of list, you better be serious about wines.  Cowboy Ciao didn't seem to be:  the server could not talk to the wines or offer up pairings, and the stemware they served the wines in was bargain basement quality.  Big mismatch here.  Serve wines in appropriate stemware.  The wines themselves - we had a total of 5 different wines, since we ended up ordering by the glass and I ordered a flight - were all ok.  My partner did really enjoy his Howell Mountain zin, but I found the Australian riesling not only off-dry, but tart.  The red flight showed diversity but I thought it was too pricey.  A flight should not be 3 glasses of wines; its should be 3 tastes of wines.  The list of wines by the glass was extensive and diverse, but I found it to be quite pricey.  

Because the Stetson chopped salad got such rave reviews, we started with it.  While I thoroughly enjoyed it, I cannot share the same hyperbole expressed by others.  It was unique as salads go, with a nice variation of flavors and consistencies, but it was a salad.  I'd order it again, but I don't think I'd consider it awesome.

Because the meal left us full and desiring of more flavor, we skipped dessert.

Overall, a decent restaurant, and perhaps very good for this area, but not one for foodies, as the concierge described it.  It's got a niche for the eclectic but I don't think it's above a 3-star experience."}
{"text":"The absolute Best service and dinning experience!!!! The Salmon plate was perfectly flavored and moist. Thank you Richard , you made my day. My husband Aj can't stop talking about it."}
{"text":"Because I like trying new things, I decided to order the elk tostada, served w/white bean \"hummus\" and roasted corn salsa. And because I ordered this, my mom went w/the curry pork quesadilla. My dad was able to find one thing on the menu that wasn't completely gross, in his taste: the Berkshire ham sandwich.

Fifteen minutes later, the Stetson arrived. I'd heard so much about this salad and had even gone to Cowboy Ciao's website to see what all the fanfare was about. Well, as beautiful as the salad looked online, it looked even more so in person. Delivered to the table, the salad is separated in six clean sections, each vibrantly colored and chopped into teeny, tiny pieces. All the flavors are complementary to one another. Topping the salad is a light, tangy, just-acidic-enough dressing that pulls all the pieces together, resulting in a well-composed salad that works perfectly as an appetizer for two.

About 15-20 minutes later, our entrees arrived at the table. My dad's ham sandwich, topped w/caramelized onions and bourbon mustard, and served on grilled brioche, was a tall sandwich w/thick slices of tender ham. The meat isn't your typical Hormel variety of deli meat; it was obvious that this came from a real piece of pork, not from a vacuum-sealed pack from the grocery store. Alongside the sandwich were thick, homemade potato chips. My dad dug in immediately, enjoying the sweet onions a lot. Although this sandwich is pretty gourmet, it was simple enough to please even my father's simple palate.

The presentation of the elk tostada was beautiful. The base of the tostada was a blue corn tortilla topped w/the white bean \"hummus\" and some melted cheddar cheese. Atop that were four or five large pieces of cornmeal-dredged elk. The consistency is similar to beef, but with a gamier taste. I would have expected it to be prepared medium-rare, but the elk seemed to be well-done, making it just a bit moister than a Phoenix summer. The creamy \"hummus\" and mild salsa helped lubricate the elk, though, so it wasn't a total bust. The entire dish could have also used some salt and pepper.

The standout meal on the table was my mom's quesadilla of the day. A large flour tortilla was stuffed w/pulled curry pork, caramelized onions, and cheese, and was topped w/a dollop of dollop of chipotle sour cream. The pork was tender, while the curry provided an unexpected but very welcome contrast in flavor. I'd never had pork w/curry, but I'd certainly give it another go because of the success of this dish. The quesadilla was a tad floppy due to it not being toasted/grilled/broiled quite long enough. I come from a family that appreciates crispness (it's a good thing my dad likes things burned, 'cause my mom tends to burn things), so I would have preferred more color and crunch in the tortilla.

Throughout the afternoon, the service continued to be attentive and friendly. We were brought our check not too long after the table was cleared, and we slipped the gift certificate into the folder-thingy to pay for our lunch. Our waiter wasn't quite sure what to do w/the certificate, but w/the help of the older gentleman who greeted and seated us, there were no problems. $50 later (not including tip), my parents and I were well-fed and content w/our lunches.

I'd like to go back to Cowboy Ciao for dinner, as my lunchtime experience there was so positive. The creative dishes on the menu make Cowboy Ciao a staple on my brother's culinary roster when he's in Phoenix, and I look forward to seeing how the restaurant's menu evolves as trends in the restaurant world change."}
{"text":"Very disappointing. We had dinner in new years eve... plates came out over one hour late, quality substandard relative to pricing. Nice setting. average service, horrible food."}
{"text":"As we all know the stetson salad is the signature dish. And oh boy did it live up to its expectations! 
The scallops were large and cooked perfectly but the base of risotto did not live up to the high standards of the remainder of this dish.
To top the night off we had a complimentary bread putting for dessert which was to die for!"}
{"text":"My server was AMAZING, I can't remember her name but really friendly, not pushy with trying to get me out of the restaurant quick, heard her make recommendations to other patrons and was quite conversational.  I had the apple cobbler which was completely awesome! I don't usually finish sweet things but this I did and I'm so glad because it was delicious and I enjoyed every bite."}
{"text":"I took my two teenagers last night, and we were delighted! The waiter was charming and attentive.  We all ordered drinks you wouldn't find anywhere else including the Viva and Hawaiian soda. We shared the mac n cheese, bread and stetson for appetizers.  I have to admit we were full at that point, but  were thrilled with the salmon and mushroom entrees.  We have been going for years and never have had a bad meal.  Last night's meal was better than I have ever remembered!"}
{"text":"Sad but true for us locals it seems this place has jumped the shark. Third visit in the last year and it seems the prevailing opinion along with ours is that service is turtle-ific, food is okay, drinks as ordered are uneven. Our family thought this would be a good landing spot for foodies but not so...too many othe places have held their own over time."}
{"text":"I had the burger, it had a great write up on the menu but I wasn't happy with it.  I think Wendy's uses better quality patties than this.  The chips were thoroughly greasy."}
{"text":"Cowboy Ciao in Phonenix Airport was a great place to waste the clock between airplane connections. Drinks were competitive to everywhere. The menu seemed to be at extremes... I didn't know what to think of the fusion. 

It didn't seem to be American or Italian food. Gourmet, definitely. My order (charred shrimp & mozzarella salad) was overpriced, but was a recommended special, and surprisingly exceptional as it kept me satisfied through delays and final flight. 

And the decor was weird... Yet, comfortable. Big screen HDTV's for sports. Friendly ambiance and great customer service."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in for light dinner and split the beautiful rainbow of color Stetson Salad. Everything in the salad just enhances it flavor along with the creamy pesto dressing.  It was plenty of salad for 2 to share. We also split the Pastrami Style Short Rib. The meat was succulent and fork tender with just the right amount of briny taste. The sauce was so good and went so well with the delicious mashed potatoes and the perfectly cooked Brussel sprouts. The sides were a great compliment to dish that just tied it all together and made it the perfect comfort food. Once again it was large enough to share. Our waiter did a great job; so complaints about the service. I almost took away a star for the decor. Its a little funky in there for our tastes but food makes up for it so I left it at well deserving 5 stars."}
{"text":"Stopped when waiting for our flight. There was a line but it did move fast. My husband and I ordered Margaritas which were very good and shared the chicken and red velvet waffles with bourbon maple syrup. We also shared the house made potato chips. Nice lunch. Great service.  We will definitely try their restaurant in Scottsdale next."}
{"text":"This isn't *just* a lunch review. I say that so you'll understand that Cowboy Ciao is also a great option for mid-day dining. Of course I want to go back for dinner and check out that menu, but all in good time...

For lunch, my hungry co-workers and I decided Cowboy Ciao was a fantastic Plan B (After Geisha so rudely dismissed us). Some of us were concerned about the price, but I figured I'd enjoy my lunch, no matter the cost, since it wasn't everyday that I get to dine at such well-received places. 

I ordered the Buffalo Carpaccio. It was on their \"light\" menu, with plates to share or options that won't leave you feeling overly stuffed. It was actually quite filling, with thin slices of seared buffalo, generous portions of goat cheese, a small green salad with beets and dried pieces of garlic bread (think upscale croutons). I loved everything but the dried bread. Oh well. It was soooo good, especially when combining the buffalo, goat cheese and green in a fork-full bite of pure enjoyment. 

My friend got the famous (or infamous) Stetson Chopped Salad. Imagine my surprise when it was smoked salmon as the main meat - not beef, as I expected. Then again, when I think cowboy + stetson, I think beef. Wouldn't you? Turns out the salad isn't named in the cowboy theme (which is tastefully displayed in the decor) but for the name of the street. Ah-ha! Clever, Cowboy Ciao. You got me there. 

Anyhow, the salad, though small for a hungry luncher, was beautiful presented - all ingredients lined up in rows, then \"chopped\" right before your eyes! My co-worker was a bit disapponted in the size of the salad for $12. It's definitely not something you should order if you're really hungry!

My other co-worker ordered the daily special - an ENORMOUS sandwich that consisted of bacon, avocado, tomatoes, rooster (i forget the \"special culinary name\" for this) and toasted ciabatta bread. It was HUGE. Definitely a bargain for $10. I heard it was damn good, too. 

I also had a cup of their coffee. Yum. With fresh cream. I noticed it was a $3.00 cup, though. Dang. Next time I will accept the offer for a re-fill! 

Soooo... what's the verdict? Cowboy Ciao gets my seal of approval. It's a great place for lunch, especially if you decide to split a couple \"light\" plates. You may even opt for desert. How can you miss the delectable temptations, when they're the first thing on the menu you see? 

Cowboy Ciao, I'm on to you. You want me to be one of the many customers leaving behind witty remarks, don't you? You want me doing back-flips like an Olympic gymnast on my way out the door? Well, like I said, I'm on to you. But don't worry. It's a good thing. You definitely won me over, especially since, with tip, I was able to have a wonderful, satisfying lunch here for $20. 

Oh yeah, and Sean, our server, was A+. 

Can't wait to go back for dinner..."}
{"text":"What a great find... food and service was outstanding!!

Our server (Justin Parker) gave us what we wanted (without us even knowing what we wanted)!!   Thank you Justin for SUPER  exceeded our expectations!!

Tiger Prawns - were cooked to perfection.   The Green Chile Elote mix was so tasty that I can't wait to duplicate this at home!

Stetson Chopped Salad - was outta this world.  The smoked 'wild' salmon is unforgettable

Lost Highway Black I PA- is ridiculously smooth... a new beer favorite.

Our entire meal was suggested by Justin... who clearly prides himself on extending himself to his patrons.  Not only are we fans of this place, but also of Justin (and we just met!)."}
{"text":"I cannot get enough of this place. I have yet to try something on the menu that I do not like. Their port vinaigrette is to die for. So is the brisket, tiger shrimp, mac n cheese... you pretty much can't go wrong with anything you order, it's all amazing."}
{"text":"We went here last night and it was really busy. When we asked to be seated they asked if we had a reservation and we said no. This was close to 7pm. The next available seating was at 9:00 p.m. and this was 2 people. HOWEVER, they said that we could sit at the bar and order anything from the menu so why not?? I actually preferred to sit at the bar, it was just as fun and you could really survey the scene around you. We shared the seared scallops and beet risotto with goat cheese and dill cream sauce. It was sooo good I wanted to lick the plate and had I not been in a restaurant I might have. The risotto was cooked perfectly and the scallops were just right. This dish by itself was $14.00...not bad at all.

For dessert we ordered the bacon cookies (chocolate chips cookies with cherries, pecans, and BACON). They were good, not the best thing in the world but really tasty and my friend's bf really like them too. 

Total meal: $31 with tax but before tip (wine $11 a glass, dish $14, cookies, $4). 

Next time I am in Phoenix I definitely want to make a stop here."}
{"text":"Decent but not great food. Very limited menu. Their signature salad is tasty, but you can get a similar version at Wildflower Bread Company. Friendly service and interesting decor. I've been here twice and was not wowed either time so I doubt I'll go back since there are so many other restaurants in Scottsdale to enjoy."}
{"text":"As someone who doesn't like the taste of salad (generally), but who isn't anti-vegetable by any means, I gave their signature Stetson chopped salad a try, and I'm a convert--so, so good!  The salad has a lot of elements to it, which give it great texture and keeps it from getting monotonous, as each bite is a little different in flavor but still cohesive.  

My husband really enjoyed the burger he got at lunch time (we didn't see it at dinner time).  It had a lot of good flavors going on and was cooked well.  It was also a massive portion!  We've tried their truffle macaroni and cheese, which my husband said was decent, but I didn't love; too bland, no truffle taste at all, and too loose for my taste."}
{"text":"I have been a long time fan and patron of this restaurant, but tonight I was so disappointed I feel I have to comment. From the waiter's horrific halitosis to not having silverware for 10 minutes while my expensive main course diminished in front if me, I would've never expected an experience so dismal. The meager attempt to regain my confidence by throwing in a free dessert was a sad white flag of failure. I spent $180 for two people and regret every dollar except the martini which was delicious. I guess even great restaurants have bad days. Unfortunately I was the recipient of this one."}
{"text":"Well after reading many reviews and then getting a solid reference from a friend, my wife and I had a enjoyable meal here on our visit to Phoenix this last weekend.  Good food, lively and good service made it a good choice.  For food we split the small mushroom pan fry which was excellent but I think the small is about as much as most people could handle as it is very rich.  Then we split the chopped salad, just amazingly good.  For main course my wife had the blue cheese stuffed pork chop which was excellent and I had the lamb loin which was very good as well.  If I had anything to complain about was the wine list.  It is just too big.  There is no reason I can think of to have a 100 + page list.  It is in order by price which is a little odd to begin with but then it makes a little more sense once you get into it.  The mark ups are reasonable on most bottles but really 100 pages? We picked out a nice bottle, the glass pours seemed about the usual mark up too and they did offer some flights of wines too.  All in all I thought it was a fun place with good food."}
{"text":"I had some pretty high expectations coming here so this is probably why my review is a three instead of a four where it probably could be.  We made reservations here on a Sunday night and had been wanting to try Cowboy Ciao for a few months.

We didn't have a reservation and were seated promptly.  I didn't really like our table, it was very small and so close to the tables behind us that we were bumping chairs with our neighbors.  It's a decently sized room, one less table in there would solve this problem.  The waitress was very knowledgeable, but she seemed to be in way too much of a hurry.  I like to relax, enjoy my meal, ask questions, etc.  She talked a mile a minute and seemed to have no interest in communicating with her guests.  I know it's not a server's job to talk to you, but it will help their tip.  Last complaint is that I felt like I was in an interrogation room since the lights were so bright.  Not really the most intimate setting.

I had the bone in pork rib chop.  It had good flavor, but was a little dry.  Not a big deal, if it was a little more juicy, it would have been perfect.  The winners at this dinner were the wine (The Imposter) and the chop salad we split beforehand.  

Overall, good menu, huge wine list.  I'd go back and sit in the other dining room, I'm sure it offers a little more intimacy.  Service was good, just not what you'd expect for a place of their reputation."}
{"text":"We had Valentine's dinner here. So we had a set menu to choose from. 

I had the shrimp- (I can't remember the name of it) but there was about 3 shrimp on a bed of some sort of slaw & it was delicious! 

My wife had the truffled Mac & cheese. She said it was ok/good, but nothing to get excited about. She said it had a good amount of garlic. 

We had the filet mignon with blue cheese mashed potatoes. The steak was very tasty, the mashed potatoes were pretty strong with the blue cheese flavor, they were good- but I wouldn't get them again. 

We had a bread pudding- which was decent. And a spicy chocolate espresso cake. (It had too much of a kick for me.) The espresso part was delish! 

I might have enjoyed this restaurant more if we had gone on a normal day. Probably would have given 4 stars. For a valentine's dinner- I wanted better! Especially for the price, which I was expecting for V-Day, just wanted a little better."}
{"text":"Awful. Not only is the food bad, but the portions are insanely small. The server was excellent though. Very eager to please and be awesome. 

Not his fault that the food was awful"}
{"text":"I had a great fusion ahi tuna sandwich here.  They made the ahi tuna with a spicy southwestern chipotle sauce on a ciabatta bread.  They added a a few other vegetables inside the sandwich.  It was absolutely delicious.  This has to be one of the best fusion combos I have ever had.  It came with a side of mashed potatos.  The actual menu is very limited, but I would come back here again just to get this dish and some wine (The wine list is huge)."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I decided to try out Cowboy Ciao for New Years Eve.....could have probably picked a better time.  

It was not jam packed however, the seating arrangements SUCKED.  They had tables set up to pack as many people in like sardines as they needed and any that were a party of two were screwed.  The two tops were along the window side (where it was very cold) and backed into corners with larger tables either in front or behind them.  Us and another couple were lucky enough to be stuck into such corners.  My legs were freezing the entire time and the loud table behind us were so close I could smell their food.  Not so much.  I don't know if seating is always like this, but I sure hope not!

As far as food goes it was set up in flights for the holiday's.  The food was pretty decent, not the best I've had but not the worst.  No real complaints on the taste or how things were cooked.  The only negative I have is that we were there for almost 4 hours so instead of a meal, it was more like an event.  Normally I'm not in a rush to eat and run, but that is a little too long for my personal taste.  

Our waiter was friendly so that was a plus.  The interior decor was outdated and just overall well, ugly.  I did like the chandeliers though. :)  Overall, it wasn't a terrible experience but I would not go back and would not recommend it to others."}
{"text":"Okay, I'm a little biased because I met the exec chef and visited CCiao with him last weekend when I was in Phoenix, so I was a little like \"wheeee!\" The bartender mixed some drinks to jive with what I'd been previously imbibing at a previous bar (tasty), and the kitchen sent out CCiao's signature dish - the exotic mushroom pan fry. Delicious and totally filling. Followed by buffalo carpaccio (any kind of carpaccio is my weakness - this is rubbed in espresso and cumin), a sampling of pork belly (delicious), seared scallops (my god, yum), and a dessert of fig cookies and a dense flan that I simply wish I could have eaten more of. The atmosphere is cozy, stylish, comforting. Sit at the bar, grab a drink and catch out what's happening in the kitchen. If only there were a Cowboy Ciao in Denver!"}
{"text":"Good place to have lunch or dinner. Menu it's small but plenty of choices. I had the breakfast enchiladas and they were delicious. My kids had the Ruben sandwich and it was ok. The quesadilla was good. The soup and salad option was good as well."}
{"text":"I cannot believe the experience we had here after the other reviews seemed so impressed. 

I'm not even going to bother writing out a big romantic tale to take you through our journey of trying to to dine here. I'm going to make this short and to the point because I've already wasted enough time on this place.

The food wasn't worth the prices. We were sizing them up as a location for our frequent company lunches and as a place to take our clients. Needless to say they failed.

First off a lunch for 4 people took 3 hours. So eating here is apparently a day trip. We even clarified that we were in a rush. So whatever you do don't tell them you're not in a hurry if you didn't bring an overnight bag.

They brought someone in our group the wrong wine and still charged us $19 for the wrong single glass of wine.

We clearly separated out our checks and explained it slowly multiple times. I don't care if separating checks is annoying, it's something you need to be able to do. 
Once the waiter had our checks and cards in hands he scrambled them all up and went about waiting on tables for another 20-30 minutes (again he knew we were in a rush). Once he got back the cards we were all charged for the wrong amounts and now required a manager to fix them. After another 30 minutes and them asking a dozen more times as to how to separate out the food on to one check and the drinks on to another we were ecstatic to finally done with this nightmare.

Come to find out days later I have a list of multiple charges on my card, that weren't simply them authorizing the purchase but full on charging me despite the fact that I didn't sign for them. I'm now in the process of fighting their fraudulent practices and when I called in they wouldn't even give me a manager to talk to."}
{"text":"If your scale at Phoenix is at morning time you shouldn't miss the \"breakfast enchiladas\", perfect combination of real \"chorizo\" enchiladas soaked in authentic \"Salsa verde\" and topped with a sunny side up eggs and sliced avocado, simply the I've ever had on an airport! Awesome!"}
{"text":"Overwhelming wine list and everything we ate was absolutely delicious. You will have no problem finding extraordinary flavors in the food here! We ordered their cheese plate, mini-mushroom dish, pork shank, and the blondie dessert...all to die for..."}
{"text":"Three stars is being kind

Cob Salad was the best part of the meal, should have stopped there 

Pork shank was dry and over cooked.  Tried to get the morrow out of the shank bone and it was so over cooked it was to dry to get out 

Louie our server was great, but the over all experience was over priced and below average"}
{"text":"If you go here you must get the Stetson salad. I'm not a crazy salad person, but this salad is unique, and delightful.

I really like that everything is made in-house here, even down to the deserts and ice cream."}
{"text":"Same 4 people had dinner here a year later.  We thoroughly enjoyed this place again.  We started with two orders of their chopped salad and it is outstanding.  You would make a big mistake to go to this restaurant and not order that.  Very unique dish, tasty, and just overall enjoyable.  For our main course, I had their Pork Shank and it was terrific.  Huge portion with very tender pork off the bone, with a nice bark type crust yet so tender.  My friend had their stuffed Pork Chop and raved about it and the two wives split 3 small plates--1 was a small version of their mushroom dish, another was scallops with a beet risotto (they liked this one the best), and the third was a sliced BBQ Pork with a picked slaw--nice mixture of sweet and smoky.  They really liked all 3 dishes.  For dessert the 4 of us split a dessert called cereal killer which was ice cream with frosted flakes brittle, caramel sauce, and an oatmeal cookie.  Very good and plenty for the 4 of us.  Our waitress--Patricia was outstanding.  She was very knowledgeable about the menu and about the wine and seemed genuinely interested in our well being.  She is a top notch waitress.  We will be back again next year when we come back for spring training."}
{"text":"chopped salad was excellent, entrees are very good too, friendly service, recommended."}
{"text":"The breakfast enchilada is a good dish.   
My husband had to send back his biscuits and gravy.
He then ordered the enchilada.  It took 20 minutes to arrive.  
The wait staff is run off their feet, but they are still sweet and smiling.  
I'd probably still come back here just for beers."}
{"text":"Went there on Monday March 26th 2018
Very pricey and was ok but have had better 
The real turnoff was the service as we were seated in the back of the restaurant 
Had a party of six 3 couples and some wanted appetizers while others wanted entrees
Asked the server for 3 separate checks
It was like asking her for her kidney
She said it was too much trouble and much easier for us to figure out
Didn't want to cause a scene and ask for the manager plus you don't agitate someone serving your food
Server was indifferent and actually borderline rude
When the bill came was prepared to get even with tip that she could divide by 3
Wrong the bill came with an 18% gratuity included
Never have I seen this with a party of 6
If you want mediocre overpriced food and terrible service I highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"Everything was just so good.. That chopped salad was delish... the duck confit stuffed pepper was so mmmm mmmm good! I forgot what other dish we had -- but so good.. Our waiter was very friendly and patient w/ us... and our dessert -- the ice cream flight (w/ really odd flavors, i.e. frosted flakes, duck fat, and ...i forgot what the last one was it was so good thought) was also delicious, except for the duck fat ice cream - so the waiter replaced the duck fat ice cream w/ another one of our choice for free...

great service, great food.. if i'm ever around the area again, will def come back."}
{"text":"There's absolutely noting bad and every thing' great about Cowboy Ciao. From a novel of a wine list to the unique creations flowing from the kitchen, bring the date, throw a party or just hit the bar. This is a must when in the area.

My original reservation through OpenTable was for 4 at 8 PM on a Thursday based solely on Yelp reviews. I was on business in the area and wanted an escape. After talking up the unique menu, interest sparked and I called to up the table to 10. The staff said they could make it happen at 8:30. By 7 the interest had grown to 19 and we have a full blown party on our hands. I was nervous but Ciao  came through. 2 tables were needed 14 and 5, but we were right next to each other. 5/5 for accommodating us on short notice. The restaurant was packed too.

Time to get our drink on. Cocktails were flowing but I was more intrigued by the huge wine list. The size of a Steven King novel and equally as scary until the waited explained the layout. Arranged by price with sections for \"Featured Winemakers\" it was surprisingly easy to follow. \"Two bottles of Santa Barbara County Pinot please\".

Great service and the amazing wine list beware, time for food. Not wanting to commit to a Big Place as it's called, I decided hit the Grazing section for sustenance. 
Ciao Mixed Greens with smoked tomato vinegerette started off the festivities followed by Abs of Squeal: curried Berkshire pork belly, grilled, with Thai chile/cucumber salad, chile oil, sweet soy and Seared Scallops over a Beet Risotto served with dill cream sauce and goat cheese. Outstanding! Beet risotto? Never heard of it but now I'm going to try and recreate it. Food portions are huge so if you with a Big Plate, you may not even need a starter. Others enjoyed the massive New Zealand Lamb Loin and Pork Rib Chop stuffed with Shropshire blue cheese. Dessert was a delicious White Chocolate Brownie and a Bread pudding.

Five out of five does not express my gratitude to the front of the house staff who made our, spur of the moment, party a huge success and to the chef who's creations were unique and mouth watering. My only disappointment is that I'm not in Scottsdale more often to enjoy Cowboy Ciao."}
{"text":"Foodies Alert!  Eat here now!  Not the best dining room but definitely the best food in the Valley and an impressive wine list to boot.  You will be very happy with your meal.  Unique flavor combos.  Super rich.  The menu is mostly meat dishes with southwestern influenced sauces.  

My picks? The chopped salad is a must.  The miso spicy squid rocks.  The mushroom pan fry is unbelievable but so rich you should opt for the \"mini\" portion. And save room for dessert.  

(pause)

The cuppa hot chocolate (\"cinnamon-spiked chocolate pot de creme with chipotle crema, ancho chile honey, cayenne-spiked ginger cookie\") is without a doubt the BEST BEST BEST dessert I have ever had ANYWHERE.  The thought of it tears me up.  Spicy, sweet, creamy goodness.  This is heaven."}
{"text":"Lots of choices for sandwiches, salads as well as meat dishes. Great service all the way around. The dessert is to die for. I highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"Fantastic food, cooked by a chef that pays attention to detail.

If you like Mushrooms, you'll be in heaven here -- try the Mushroom Pan Fry..  

Great wine list too!"}
{"text":"Great service and great food. The blue cheese stuffed pork chop was delicious and the wine list was also very good. I recommend the cereal killer for dessert as well."}
