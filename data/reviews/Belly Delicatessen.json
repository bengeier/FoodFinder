{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE!!!!!! I order lunch from here at least 2-3 times a week. The staff is very friendly, and the sandwiches are the best deli sandwiches I have had. The prices are great as well. I call ahead and my order is ready within minutes. The bread is always fresh which is a huge plus!!!! I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"My wife & I have eaten there several times and the food has always been good. (We're both fans of their Italian hoagie.) 
We decided to try their catering service and were delighted when we picked-up the sandwich trays. Three sandwich rings fed 45 people and offered a nice variety along with fresh toppings. (We were especially pleased with the presentation because it didn't require us to do much work before serving everyone.)"}
{"text":"Very disappointed! Saw an ad for this place and was very excited to try it. This is the kind of place I've been waiting for around here. Checked the hours and it said in the ad they are open Sunday's. My fianc√© and I stopped today to get some lunch here, and apparently they changed their hours. So don't go by their ads and don't go by yelp either! Probably won't try to stop back."}
{"text":"I drive past Belly everyday and always say to my husband \"we need to check it out sometime\". I finally stopped for lunch. There was no other customers, but I did stop early. The space was very clean and nicely decorated, way nicer than I expected. The young girls working were sweet and helpful.  They have a lot of sandwiches to choose from including creating your own deli sandwich, which is great for a picky husband like mine. I got a pastrami with provolone on sour dough. The pastrami was delicious....haven't had good pastrami in awhile. The bread is fresh and equally delicious. I also got a cup of soup (broccoli cheddar) which was equally good. The menu can be a bit confusing and it is 2 sided which I didn't realize until after I ordered (although there is a menu displayed on the deli case...so I guess that one is my fault). Also, the menu lists 4 or 5 soups, but they only offer 2 of the soups per day and rotate them. I told my husband about how good it was and we are planning to grab sandwiches for dinner. I will be back again and wish I had gone sooner. I hope they get more business as it is a great local sandwich shop."}
{"text":"meh. nothing great. bland sandwiches made with no love staffed by a teenager. deli case is just sad. looks like something in an off-the beaten track place in a poor nation.  no other customers. no action. no bacon. no egg, tuna or chicken salad. the bread was good, nice to find good pastrami. but the sandwich was not worth it or the hassle getting in and out of the parking lot. i want a good family deli to succeed in monroeville, unfortunately this was not it."}
{"text":"I have been here several times with a friend and once with my 15 year old son. I have built my sandwiches each time and my son tried their meatball sub. We were all happy, the sandwiches are big, fresh bread, quality meats and cheese and the veggies were good. Well made sides too. I will return soon."}
