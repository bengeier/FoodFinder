{"text":"Had the fish tacos here for the first time and it was really good - great mix of crunch and taste and fish batter was good too. The beer selection is extensive for those looking for stuff you can't find elsewhere. Service can improve."}
{"text":"As one of the first to arrive at our table at 730, I figured I could eat before any kind of rush. I was wrong. Service was brutal. I watched 4 servers mill around the cash machine trying to figure out how to split another tables bill.   90 minutes later and me being so hungry I was now seeing white flashes, my food arrives. Why my waitress didn't have the common sense to bring my pre-made salad out  maybe an hour ago, I am not sure. Maybe it's not the best time to train a new server is on a Saturday night at 9pm.  All said and done, I wish I could say the food was actually good. Sausages were bland and dry. Pickled vegetables were so soggy, they disintegrated under the weight of my fork. Literally 5 things on the menu and you couldn't even get 2 of them right? My only solace is that I know this place will be closed in 6 months. Savvy diners in this city won't put up with this nonsense.   So I ended up paying 30$ for 3 nasty sausages and 10$for a bowl of pickled baby food."}
{"text":"Checked this place out on a Friday evening using a buytopia voucher. The voucher made it an incredible deal and I would have gladly paid full price for this delicious experience. My partner and I were stuffed, he enjoyed a whiskey, and I a non-alcoholic trip for a $65 bill including tax, which was reduced to $50 with the voucher. We were also not made to feel 'less than' for using the voucher, which is sometimes the experience.  My partner and I shared the charcuterie plate which had the most delicious pâté and prosciutto, and other meats and mustards,and was happily customized to avoid gluten for us. We then shared the sausage platter and I can easily say the Wild Boar sausage is the best I've ever had. The duck was also very nice! We took a chance on the chipotle bison, but it wasn't to our taste, though the quality was still very good.  The service was friendly and accommodating, though the server seemed to be working the entire place by herself and as the small restaurant got full and busy, we saw less of her, but there were no problems with the service.  The food presentation was lovely and appetizing, and the only strange part to me was the horrible, cheap, rough napkins. Those need to be replaced, stat.  Will definitely return and would highly recommend for anyone who enjoys sausage."}
{"text":"Had a craving for sausages.   We had the cheese plate kind of disappointed for the price.  Barely any cheese and could have used more types of breads or crackers not tiny pretzel sticks.  The sausages were great and the bun was amazing.  I could have been satisfied just eating the bun.  Yum."}
{"text":"Came here last night for there grand opening with a couple friends and it was a great time! The interior is a cool set up and design, very funky and modern, fitting in perfect with the neighbourhood! They specialize in sausages as the name hints at and they do it well! It was very fair pricing for each menue option! I liked how each order includes two toppings! For there opening they had great drink deals! On regular nights it seems like it's be standard pricing. Our server was absolutely lovely and very attentive and conversational for a busy night. They had a dj last night who played remixes which was fun, music did get pretty loud so it was have chats for a bit but it made for a lively, fun atmosphere! It's a great addition to the neighbourhood, will definitely come on the regular!"}
{"text":"I saw and read about the $11 for sausage and beer but asked it was not on at time. I think I heard it is for lunch but who knows since I'm not there.  With that aside though, they have sausages. Elk, venison, rabbit, lamb and multiple types of pork. They also had boar, not on the menu. I would say the boar did not taste gamey.  The place looked rather empty for a Friday night but it did end up adding more people.  For the price, you also get French fries which for most part are fried wire nice and crispy. However, one of our fries had no salt!  They also got the orders a little mixed up with respect to whether one for a salad or fries. Surely a few organizational things to sort out.  The drinks are plenty though. A fair amount of bottled beer and at least 10 beers on tap, a few imported but for most part craft beer; but they also have delirium tremens on tap! The bottles are also craft beer heavy. The beer menu is so big it's hard to even make a choice!"}
{"text":"Fish tacos really good. Beer selection was really good also. Great stop in for bar hoping around this area in the summer time. Music is always good here"}
{"text":"Went there last night and i'm not one to usually write a review but this place was awesome!! So many different options for beers and with respect to their gourmet sausages well i've never has one that tasted like that!!! Delicious!!"}
{"text":"So a large group of my friends and I decided to check out the new La Saucisserie restaurant on the weekend. We were greeted by the door and seated right away. Their menu had a wide variety of sausages so we decided to order a few and share (chorizo, duck, wild boar, bratwurst and rabbit). I liked all of them as they each had its own taste. You get to choose the toppings so as a picky eater I was grateful!  We also shared a large poutine that came with sausage slices which is a must try! It went really well with the cold beer. I'm not a beer drinker so I asked them to help me find one that was really lite. I noticed that they really knew their beer. I don't recall the name of the one I had but it was really smooth. I can't wait for their grand opening this Saturday to try the other stuff on their menu."}
