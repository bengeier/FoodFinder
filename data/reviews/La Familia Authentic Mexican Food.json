{"text":"I finally found a place that I can get tacos near my home. Usually I have to travel farther when i want some real mexican tacos. I  ordered 2 tacos of carne asada, and 2 of carnitas to go.  The tacos were ready fast, and I enjoyed them. I recommend coming here if you want some tacos in this side of town. I thought that the flavor of the carnitas was good, but  it was a little dry.  It seemed like they were a little bit older, but I still enjoyed them. I definitely recommend the carne asada tacos.  Overall, the price is reasonable, and the food was good."}
{"text":"Always drove by the area and finally decided to try it out. Really good food it really is authentic compared to the others in the area. I have been back twice in the same week it's that good."}
{"text":"So I was excited for a real authentic Mexican restaurant around my neighborhood but this place is far from being authentic I walked in and wasn't even greeted the lady at the register just stood there plus the staff Looked mad and looked like they didn't want to be there I ordered three burritos and three tacos they bagged  it up for me and didn't even ask me if I wanted any salsas once again the lady just stare at me and without saying nothing I rather take my business and drive two minutes more and go to Roberto's where they actually you and ask you if you want any extra stuff like salsas limes cucumbers etc."}
{"text":"Place serves old food, just nothing good. Don't recommend it but I guess everyone has different tastebuds."}
{"text":"This place is quick and friendly. I've called ahead a couple times to order for pick up and it's always ready and delicious. Love their bean and cheese burritos and carne asada burritos."}
{"text":"This place was good I decided to give it a try and was not disappointed will definitely be back I tried the shrimp ceviche witch came with a home made tostada and tried the street style tacos yum!"}
{"text":"We ordered the carne asada nachos & carne asada chimichanga. Loved it! Not super greasy like how robertos/don tor taco and for almost about the same price. Portions were a good size. They also served us tortilla chips & salsa before our meals came out. Good service & good food. I've food my new go-to spot!"}
{"text":"On point! The staff was sweet and fast and the food was great. I used to think Tacos el Gordo was the only decent taco shop around north Vegas... psh! La Familia blew them out of the water! The carne asada tacos are just... you just gotta go get some and bring me some too lol! (Seriously bring me some) Officially my new favorite restaurant!!"}
{"text":"First time for me and my husband and we absolutely loved it. Very friendly staff and very good food. I ordered Carne Asada fries and they were so good. The meat was cooked well. Really recommend it to others!"}
{"text":"I have driven by this place multiple times but never had a chance to stop by. I noticed the last time I pumped gas next door they closed at 9 on Saturdays. So we call on Saturday around 8 pm to place an order to pick up and we get told they're closed but they'll take our order anyway. So I'm a little confused that the door says 9 but at 8 they are closed. Anyway we order birria tacos and they have no birria.. So ok we order shrimp cocktails.. And they have none. We end up ordering some burritos, ceviche and tacos al pastor. The al pastor was cool..  The ceviche was mostly vegetables and a few pieces of chopped up shrimp. The California burritos were also just ok. I was also surprised there is no salsa bar inside. Anyway .. Long story short..won't be back!"}
{"text":"Decent food although our order was missing 1 taco and the tostadas for the shrimp ceviche. I ordered take out and I should have checked the order before leaving but I didn't. Unfortunately, we live farther away and it would have been a waste of time to drive all the way back for one taco and 5 tostadas."}
{"text":"Wow, this place is so good! It truly is authentic. Everything I've had has been excellent (sopes, tacos, enchiladas, rice, beans, chips & salsa) it has all been very fresh. Hidden gem! I am so glad I stopped."}
{"text":"My first experience with this establishment!  I saw they offered delivery, and because I'm literally 2 blocks away, I thought sure! We have to have them for dinner.  I had placed my order around 3 pm for a delivery at 5.  When 5:20 creeped around I started to wonder and was going to call, and as soon as I picked up my phone, they were here! There were two smiling and friendly ladies and an adorable boy, clearly out of breath to get my order to me.  I had forgot to add my building number in this crazy complex :( Anyways, that interaction was priceless.  I felt like their most important customer who they so desperately wanted to get to in time so my family could eat.  They clearly take pride in their food and their customers.  Now that I have tried it once and it was delicious, I'll be making this a family takeout staple in our home."}
{"text":"We ordered three crunchy style tacos and four regular style and they were all delicious!   I am looking forward to trying some of their other food.  The ladies working there were really nice too.   A little light on the English, though.    :)"}
{"text":"I was craving some authentic Mexican food and decided to ask the almighty yelp to guide me in the right direction and it brought me here. I had the chicken tacos and they were yummy! My cousin had the al pastor tacos and she said it was awesome!  This is a real family owned restaurant. You gotta try it!"}
{"text":"Ever since ownership changed, the food is just not as good. The steak meat is not good on the tacos. The customer service is good, but I stopped going here. I used to go once a week."}
{"text":"4 stars because I only order food when the owner is there he makes the food like it was his own but other wise place is clean family friendly and food is awesome"}
{"text":"Top notch food from south of the border. Highly recommended and worth every cent. The food is prepped onsite and utilizes authentic Mexican recipes and ingredients. The open kitchen allows you to watch your dish get made from scratch."}
{"text":"This was the first Mexican place that I have eaten at since I moved to Vegas less than 2 weeks ago. I was starving and craving a burrito. This place did not disappoint. The ONLY gripe I could possibly think of, is that the Carne Asada was a bit chewy. But hey, it's Carne Asada! I ordered the Carne Asada burrito and an order of Nachos with shredded chicken. One thing I did NOT expect, was for the burrito to be almost the size of my forearm. The Nacho platter was also gigantic. Needless to say it took me all night eating on and off to even come close to finishing it all. I would definitely recommend this place and, I will for sure go back!"}
{"text":"Came here for a late night ceviche pick up and it definitely hit the spot! Very good ceviche."}
{"text":"Food is always good.  Friendly staff and great flavors.  Better than Robertos."}
{"text":"Very good burritos and tacos!!! My favorite is the carne asada wet burrito with green sauce! Great local family  style restaurant!"}
{"text":"Stopped in the middle of the afternoon. We had their Red/Green wet burritos (one chicken & one carne asada). Excellent."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this great little restaurant. Everything is always delicious and everyone is always so friendly. Definitely becoming a weekly tradition."}
{"text":"This is the perfect spot to get grandpa, with no teeth a California burrito. All mush no meat."}
{"text":"All i can do right now is bow my head for this restaurant!  May they R.I.P ......AGAIN! I cant front im really feeling some type of way right now, because  I really wanted us to have something here!  Real authentic burritos and what not...but all im feeling right now is sickly after eating that taquito.. i mean burrito. 

To the review. .
First impressions are everything and the guy running the place was a real meatball. He had an attitude because the lady had a hard time processing my card and needed help.  Then,  to my dining let down,  NO SALSA BAR. I was forced to request my own salsas (3..what can i say i like salsa on every bite), carrots and onions,  and lime. When I asked he questioned my salsa needs.  IMHO you don't make a big deal about salsa when your business is struggling. Give that ish away!!  Especially now that I'm home and decided to throw it away because it was weak! 

On to the burrito,  the flavor of the meat was edible. Yes I just made edible a flavor.  The size was comparable to a Tina burrito in the frozen section at smith's. Only difference is the mushy rice.  Tina burritos don't have mushy rice. 

Anyway to sum this up... the only reason to come here is you can sit anywhere. .. because its empty.  (Now i know why) 


Im done.  I literally feel this burrito coming up and not in a good way."}
{"text":"I come here a lot because it's convenient for me. The service and food seem to change depending on the day. If the manager is there is it amazing although he is not in there often. Every single time he is not there I get over charged and never get chips and salsa but if he is there I do and he always seems to be happy, but the lady that works there not so much, and she is either over charging on purpose or is just really bad at math. There is also a $2.00 charge for using card they don't tell you about. Kinda ridiculous if you ask me."}
{"text":"We recently move to this side of town and have been looking for a good Mexican restaurant, this will not disappoint very very good. And great service."}
{"text":"Joy C. should be barred from yelping.. Anyone that gives Robertos taco shop 4 stars is not an authoritarian on authentic Mexican food.

_end shade here_  Anywho
 
What I Had:
Chimmichanga with carna asada 
Churro 

What I Thought:
Que rico!!!! It was very very very deliciouso. Ouuu the churro dough..... was yum.   I am now full and sleepy. nighty night. #GrubLyfe"}
{"text":"Best find ever! This place is worth going out of your way. Authentic and fresh Mexican food with fast friendly service that can't matched elsewhere. It's clear they love what they are doing. I will definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"I was just reading every one else's reviews and saw some pictures so I wanted to post mine. I live close to La Familia and found this gem. They have amazing food and great customer service. I have tried their Birria Burrito... Amazing!  I love the shrimp ceviche... It does take a while for them to make but be patient!!  I've eaten in the restaurant and have taken food to go. My drink never went empty and they were very generous with their chips and salsa. The man at the counter even recognizes me she I go in. He keeps thanking me for my business. Great place to go!"}
{"text":"I get my nails and eyebrows done a couple doors from La Familia and today, after hearing that they have reopened, I went in for a chorizo and egg breakfast burrito. For $4.99 you get a big burrito that was full of yummy stuff. It comes with an option of green or red salsa. It was good, filling and the ratio of chorizo, scrambled eggs and potatoes was spot on. I had the red salsa which was good too. Smoky, not too spicy.

I've tried their al pastor tacos and menudo in the past and they were good too.

Oh and by the way, they give military discount  but charge a small fee for debit/credit card transactions.

I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I wouldn't recommend this place. Food wasn't good and they have a greasy dirty grill right in the front entrance . The menudo tasted reheated and days old."}
{"text":"Damn Gina!! Boy, I was pleasantly surprised! I ordered a carne asada burrito and one of each taco for the family to try. Upon the first bite of my burrito I could tell that this was going to be different. I had a 'Pleasantville' (movie) moment you know in that movie when the technicolor was turned on, this was something more than what I was used to. The burrito wasnt the biggest but it was big enough and loaded with the good stuff and I did manage to finish it. Honestly, do most of us need to be able to finish a whole damned monster-sized burrito?? I sampled the meat of each taco and they tasted flavorful and fresh.

I had called my order in and was told that it would be ready in ten minutes. It was. There was a. 50cent atm charge which I didn't mind as I normally pay cash and should've been prepared. You can tell by the quality of the food that this was a family that had done this before. Lucky us in North Las Vegas."}
{"text":"This place has amazing food! The carnitas blew me away. I've traveled all over Texas, California, Arizona, and New Mexico. The places I consider to have the best Mexican food. This place takes number one for me hands down! Also the staff was very friendly and the service was great. Have been returning every since my first bite!"}
{"text":"We do not live in this area but we're out at the Veterans Hospital on Saturday (8/12). After leaving the hospital, we were looking for a place to eat near by the hospital without driving all over the Valley.
I looked on Yelp and found La Familia Authentic Mexican Food. To be honest, we didn't really know what to expect. We found the location very quickly. It's nothing \"fancy\". However the staff was very friendly. Brought out chips & salsa. I had the taco special with carnitas, included rice & beans. Very tender, spices just right. My husband had the carnitas burrito. We both had sodas, it was less than $20. Unfortunately, we are often at the VA Hospital....but we're glad we found La Familia, we will return!"}
{"text":"I ordered  from this place for the first time last night I must say, I never ate my Food and got a refund! The customer service was Lousy! I had a Menu that I picked up from there a week ago and decided last night I would try it I ordered the Wet Carne Asada Burrito over the phone I asked the young lady \"what all comes on and in it she told me but never mentioned it came with Sour Cream or Guacamole and I don't eat Either of the 2. My wife picked it up and brought it home I quickly brought it back and said \"you never mentioned over the phone it was topped with Sour Cream and Guacamole she said \"YOU DIDNT READ THE MENU!?\" I said No I chose to ask you! Instead!....then she says \"WHY IS IT SAUCE WAISTED IN THE BAG!?\" I said Mamm its a WET! burrito your the one that put to much WET! On it not me!.....at that point I decided to get my $9.50 back. As the customer I should just be given my food the way I want it I didn't ask for the 3rd Degree!, I paid and I deserve to be treated better I feel they had a problem with my Race when I came in as a Brother with a problem cause my wife said they had an attitude when she went to pick it up.... Ill never! Go to this place again ill just go to Robertos across the street from them where a Black man like myself can feel respected you've lost a Customer and I never got a chance to taste your food that's really Sad"}
{"text":"I was planning on making this my Mexican spot for lunch, since I work way out there in North Las Vegas.  

All I can say is wow, what a massive let down.  This was my 4th stop at the joint & I made unfortunate mistake of ordering shrimp cocktail.  It was more like shrimp soup, as it was unlike any shrimp cocktail I've ever had (it was a water party).  Also, for $13, it contained a total of 5 shrimp.  

I was extremely hungry that day, and thought I was being clever for remembering to phone in my order.  I should've known things would go downhill when during my previous visit I tried to order shrimp cerviche and the place was out of shrimp for the second time.  I won't be returning.  I discovered this place here on Yelp, btw."}
{"text":"I had the wet burrito with chicken with green sauce.  It was great and enough for two people.  They served chips and salsa before the burrito at no extra charge.  Good food, good service."}
{"text":"Got lost by happy accident. Stopped to get gas and directions when I saw the resturant. So glad we stopped. Food was super good, fresh and fast. The staff members are unbelievably nice, and helpful. I had some amazing, fresh and tasfastte tacos and soup. I wish I lived in Las Vegas. Thank you guys for making our trip."}
{"text":"Wow this place is good. I wish I lived closer! I ordered the carne Asada burrito. The meat was tasty, juicy and hot (in temperature). I will come back next time I am in the area."}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant several times in the past and this is the first time I'm reviewing it. 

La Familia is a Mexican restaurant that serves a variety of Mexican food like burritos, tacos, Menudo and many other items.

The food taste really good and the portions that you receive are more than fair. I bought a wet burrito this time $8.60 it has a lot of meat in it and is a pretty big size,enough to fill one adult. I recommend taking cash because if you use your debit card or credit card you will be charged a $.50 fee


The restaurant itself is not a big place it's a small place with enough seating room for roughly 20 to 30 people, I have never seen the restaurant filled to where there is no seating as the majority of customers order the food and go home especially if there is  a large group they might be able to accommodate you but then again they might not.


Overall La Familia it's a nice little restaurant with really good food, I give this place a 3.5 star rating because of the quality of food and the portions you get."}
{"text":"The food here is sooooo good. We've been coming here for quite some time. The family that owns it are so welcoming. The food is authentic, which is hard to find. (Robertos is not authentic). Great prices and specials. Definitely worth visiting if you haven't."}
{"text":"This is the best taco place in Las Vegas hands down!! The customer service is polite and respectful! The manager is a real cool guy! So nice and super funny! I've been here a dozen times so far and keep coming back! Definitely kid friendly and know what's up when it comes to their tacos and burritos!! I live in deep Summerlin and I drive half an hour just to have their tacos! :) :D if you don't try this place you're definitely missing out!! BEST TACOS EVER!!!!!"}
{"text":"Best Sopes in Vegas. Amazing carnitas and the family is friendly and helpful. It may not be much from the outside but authentic Mexican food is inside and will leave you wanting to come back. We will be back for Chilaquiles for breakfast."}
{"text":"It was a great local Mexican establishment. I believe it has permanently closed recently. If so I would definitely be sad to see it go. Great food excellent location and fantastic employees. You will be missed."}
{"text":"Small place that has really good food. As good as I've had in Mexico. I'll be back for sure. The Al Pastor was tender and flavorful and the shrimp ceviche was made to order."}
{"text":"Ordered Ubereats from here today.. Looked good on the website, got the burrito.. was good.. the quesadilla was good.. but when I took it out of the bag it was crawling with cockroaches and there was cockroach stains on the uber eats bag. I was disgusted. Threw it away and will not be ordering from here ever again. 

Actually I contacted the Health Department to investigate because they should not be open."}
{"text":"I live by the area, and been there quite a few times... the taste is real Mexican food! Not like that nasty Roberto's shit.... plus always great service and great tasting food! I usually get the asada fries or the burritos... my family loves the tacos."}
