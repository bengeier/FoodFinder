{"text":"Not sure what I just ate. 

Staff is super friendly. Service is quick. 

Ordered the chicken noodle soup, bourbon chicken, beef steak with onions, and chicken with vegetables and almonds over the phone. Lady said it would be ready in 10 minutes. That's a lot of food to be ready in 10 minutes so right then I knew it wasn't going to anything good. But, I guess I shouldn't expect anything more.

Overall, food wasn't very good. The beef was just okay and the chicken with vegetables and almonds was downright awful. To be honest, I'm not even sure the Bourbon chicken was actually chicken. 

Anyway I'd stick to the soups and some of the deep fried items on the menu as they're less likely to taste like mystery meat. Would NOT recommend."}
{"text":"The place is clean and the people who work there are always friendly. The food is decent and one of the better chinese take out places in the area. The portions are big and the price is great!"}
{"text":"It's an average chinese take out place. They have a few lunch specials for $5. So if you are on a budget it's not bad at all to grab lunch from here. I tried their chow mein with sesame chicken lunch special. It also came with an egg roll."}
{"text":"Service not bad at all...food are great for a small joint like this.....nice to discover China 8
Will be back again for sure!!"}
{"text":"Tried general tsao chicken and chilli chicken, Dry sticky chicken pieces on both dishes plus with no flavor At all, very bland...disapointed"}
{"text":"Cheap, decent Chinese food served in huge portions.

I went here yesterday for take out dinner for the first time. It took about 15 minutes to make our order, which wasn't too bad. The service was also good too.

I ordered the c10 dinner combo and when I brought the food home, I was impressed with how much food they give you. It came with an egg roll, sweet and sour chicken balls, spicy beef, fried rice, and all of this just cost $7.95 plus tax. I also ordered some shrimp dumplings on the side.

The food itself is just ok. It didn't taste horrible or anything like that. Still, the whole meal is just \"meh\".

Yet again, the portions are huge. So if you are looking for a lot of food for cheap, this place will do the trick. I was satisfied, and will most likely be back again."}
{"text":"My wife was telling me about this place that opened up near us. Got in around 11:30 - 12:00 and the place was dead. Not like any other quick Chinese food. 

Ordered general tao chicken w/ chicken fried rice which is my favourite when I go to these small places. I  took a bite and went for the rice first and found that rice was plain , a bit dry and has no or little flavour had to add a bit of pepper and soy sauce to have the flavour pop out. Chicken was to soggy for my palette. It was drench in sauce that the crunchiness of the chicken was gone. Gave this place a 3 star just because I found the place is clean and the cashier was friendly. Maybe I'll try this place one more time and order something different."}
{"text":"had take out for lunch and was pleased with my order. the sesame chicken was crunch and good. The location is a bonus."}
{"text":"They packed  the wrong order. Ordered chilli chicken handed my friend chicken balls or something. No cutlery, napkins, soy sauce or plum sauce for the veg roll. My friend who had no idea what my order would or should have been was kind enough to bring it over.  I called back to inquire and the lady on the phone told me that those chicken balls are in fact \" Chilli chicken\". Although I could see it with my own eyes at this point, She wasn't convinced. I said never again and decided to not pull missions to get back to the store. I can tell you now that the Chicken balls and friend rice were bland and tasteless. I dont know what parts of chicken are being used to make those as I got alot of hard cartilage and hard bits. It had to be tossed after 4-5 bites."}
{"text":"This place by no means is bad - I would say it's average.

The food I had was very oily but satisfying for when someone is very hungry and the portions are huge. 

As you stop being hungry and actually taste the food - you realize it wasn't actually as amazing as you initially thought. My black pepper steak had zero black pepper in it. My sweet and sour pork was more breading than meat. What disappointed me the most were the extremely oily noodles that were closer to an udon when the picture shows chow mein noodles. 

The cashier was abrupt and abit rude when we asked to get our orders in two separate bags since they were put into one. 

Overall - I would go back. They provide filling food of average taste that hits the spot when you want something cheap and quick. The wait was about 10 minutes."}
{"text":"Had to do quick pick up just for myself as I had seen this place sometime ago and I was in the area, decided to give it a try.

Ordered a Spicy Mixed Vegetables and asked to make it extra spicy and my usual request everywhere - less or no oil.

The ordering was quick and there were just two customers ahead of me and perhaps they had a larger order.

One can see the chef making the dish and saw that he does not clean te wok between dishes. The making was so quick that I could not intervene. Being a vegetarian I prefer that they clean the wok. I am hoping that the dish made prior was all vegetarian as well. The dish did not taste of cross contamination, but who knows?

The dish itself was good. The quantity when poured in the plastic container was heap full and the cashier could hardly close it. The gravy had some sweet, sour and spice in it. The extra spicy request was fulfilled with extra dry red chillies. Not ideal as I believe one should not eat whole red chillies for spicy flavour.

Would go back again to give it another try."}
{"text":"Do not judge a book by it's cover. The outside and even the name of the restaurant seems/looks very ghetto. It actually took my some time to give it a try. 
· Prices: are very good.$8.20-$9 for a meal is an awesome combo price.
· Portion: they give you a lot. I had enough to save for the next day and have lunch 
· Food: it's not bad. It's good, not great. Compared to a big chain restaurants, this place is below average but the price is the reason you will come back. 

Hey I enjoyed it. It wasnt amazing but if you are looking for safe cheap chinese food, this is your place."}
{"text":"China 8 is my favourite Chinese place in Mississauga-- they're cheap, service is friendly and fast, they give huge portions, and their food is really good!

I tend to get the shrimp fried rice, coconut shrimp, beef and black bean noodles, or one of the sweet chicken dishes like sweet and sour chicken or General Tso's. Their crab and cheese wontons are delicious, and you get them for free if you pay cash on orders of over 20 dollars! I really appreciate how good the food is, and I've been coming to them for several months now whenever I need a quick dinner.. they also deliver, which is great!

Nobody really sits inside to eat, except other students honestly. Most of this place's business comes in the way of deliveries and take-aways, so don't judge this place just because it seems empty to you."}
{"text":"I recently ordered from this restaurant, after trying somewhere else. I found that when this place is busy (Friday or Saturday night) the food quality is good. Everything was very tasty, I just wish they would do normal chicken balls, and not the small bites. Also, when you order chinese food, that comes with chicken fried rice and egg rolls, they should place soy sauce and plum sauce in the bag. This is not something you should have to find out once you get home."}
{"text":"This place has some good Chinese food ! Would definitely recommend. Everything is fresh and delicious and even the prices are fair. We've ordered twice now and have yet to be disappointed. Only complaint is that their chicken balls aren't super fluffy (but some people may like that - just a personal preference of mine). 
Also the won ton soup is delicious but on the saltier side. We orders for two and spent under $30.00."}
