{"text":"We asked our concierge for a decent family restaurant to go to and he provided a couple of suggestions including beaver hall (bh).  I had walked past bh earlier in the day and it appeared slightly formal so  I asked the concierge if iWeb might be under dressed however he assured me that MTL is casual in the summer.  I entered bh at approximately 8pm and the place was half full at best.  The maitre d asked if I had a reservation (code-I want to go to the peeler joint in half an hour).  We were seated and our initial waiter came to take our order-he was actually quite pleasant.  Food arrived and waiter 2 (I'm going to line up for Celine tickets!) put (left) my wife's order at another table and gave me my daughters kids meal.  We thought maybe he was in a hurry to serve the other  remaining 2 tables (OMG 4 more hours for Celine-I need to shower).  Anyways food was bland but too my surprise no one came by to give the food quality check-how is everything, no one asked - would you like another cocktail (I love Celine!).  Now the mad rush to clean up started and chairs and stuff started to fly by us.  My daughter could not finish her meal and asked waiter 2 if he could pack it to go.  Waiter 2's reply was sure \"if you really want to\"!  After being provided the desert menu we reminded waiter 2 that the kids meal included desert and he said yeah okay-we were sitting around guessing what that might be?  We were pissed offf waiting and wondering if we were taking up everyones valuable time however no one was around to flag down for the bill.  When we saw waiter 2 we asked if we were taking up too much of there valuable time and we should leave.  He said no no like who me?  We paid the bill and left feeling disappointed and dissed."}
{"text":"Food and service where great.  I had steak.  French food with different variations of sauces.  All in all everything was great .  Didnt try desert.  But defenitely a strong menu for dinner out with friends, romantic for couples and for groups.  Wines were OK at best, cabernet was OK, but i'm sure there selection is better, I just didnt want to indulge do to price point, otherwise a great Foodie place."}
{"text":"We had a great dinner here. The French onion soup and fish & chips were great. Service was very attentive and they were very friendly with our daughter."}
{"text":"I went here with a colleague during a work meeting--about a five block walk from our hotel. It was a Wednesday night, and the restaurant was reasonably full. I called ahead 15 minutes to make an 8:30pm reservation, and they were nice as can be.

The great thing about this restaurant is their fixed price menu. Even while traveling, I still need to be budget conscious. We were able to get a half bottle of wine, salad, and an entree for about $35. Not bad.

The salad was great, with ripe tomatoes and a great dressing (Mesclun salad, fine herbs, cherry tomatoes and roasted hazelnuts). I had wild mushroom and asparagus canellonis with ricotta, which was phenomenal. And the wine was great.

Ambiance was very good; my colleague and I had a booth and were able to carry on a conversation easily. 

I highly recommend this place for good, unique food, at a reasonable price. Perfect for the business traveler."}
{"text":"Well I had great expectations for dinner with my work collegues and out of town guests, having been there for lunch several times, my dinner was not that great. I ordered the smoked salmon with beets and found it rather uninspired and a very little quantity considering the price. Then my main course was the scallops where I was served three small scallops, no bigger than a dollar coin. The veg waa very dull, reminded me of no name frozen veg in a watery sauce. No real taste to the whole dish and two of my coworkers had the same and agreed that this not an impressive dish. Fortunately my meal was saved with an order of the large and delicious creme brulee. Altogether I think most of the dishes my coworkers ordered were well enjoyed, yet my experience was a letdown for the dishes that could been just been a bit better."}
{"text":"Starts - Bread very hard, typical French style baguette.

Salad was fantastic and fresh. Whole hazelnuts. Greens were not bitter.

Entree - here's where it gets really good!  Wow, so good; perfect compliment of flavors. Carpaccio, capers, fresh squeezed lemon. Sliced cheese. Salted Portobello mushrooms. 

A decent half bottle of wine (red or white) compliments the dinner choice and is part of the fixed price meal.

Service - very prompt, frequent and friendly.  I would describe them as a \"professional\" wait staff.  The English speaking is so-so here"}
{"text":"Love their food and the ambiance is great. Whenever my partner and I go to that resto, it never disappoints! The portions are generous! The crepe suzette is awesome!"}
{"text":"Even before opening the door I had the feeling my friend and I were in the wrong place. I'm certain I was the only man in the place without a sports jacket or business suit, and probably the only one wearing jeans, sneakers and a leather jacket. Which may be why we got seated at one of the worst tables in the joint, beside the second kitchen entrance and the women's washroom.

My friend ordered Fish and Chips (yes, it's only in English on the menu) and I had steak frites. Our fries were burnt and mushy, a sure sign of being cooked in too-hot oil and they only tasted like grease. My baby spinach salad (just spinach) was drenched in an anonymous vinaigrette. The batter on the fish and chips was decent on the outside, but mushy inside. But they do know how to grill a flank steak: mine was perfectly done. I give them points for that. The shallot sauce was inoffensive. We skipped wine as we were going to walk up Mont Royal and didn't want to be tired.

Presentation is over the top: every condiment comes in its own little jar, the french fries are served in a tiny fry basket, there are little plastic tongs for lifting the cornichons out of their jar and your plate (or in my friend's case, board) is trimmed with a strip of red and white checked paper. Perhaps this is what people once thought was part of an elegant casual business lunch circa 1970. Hilarious. And then there's the carousel pony in the middle of the room.

Hard sell on the desserts. They don't bring you a dessert menu or tell you what the desserts are, they bring them to you on a tray to entice you to make a selection. Fruit salad, yogurt, creme brulée. Nothing surprising.

Service both at the table and from the kitchen was quick: they definitely know how to pump things out for the lunch crowd. Our server was friendly and probably as attentive as possible given that the place was packed.

Stars off for the dated presentation and mostly mediocre food. Stars gained for service and a properly cooked steak. Going back? Never."}
{"text":"Came here with the hubby for restaurant week. Based on some of the negative reviews about the place being pretentious, I was taken aback at how casual the decor was. I was expecting something much more upscale and this is definitely not a place to go if you want to impress someone with ambiance or view. It looked and sounded more like a family restaurant, (although the menu might not be to a child's liking).

Service was great and we enjoyed all the extra munchies that come for \"free\" (bread, pickles, cheese) with dinner here. Not sure we would go back because even though everything was great, nothing was really extraordinary."}
{"text":"Great food and Great service! Love the foie gras I had!"}
{"text":"Popped into Montreal on an overnighter and wanted to eat some French bistro food and Beaver Hall did a great job at meeting that need. 

The food was very good - my calamari was excellent (tender and tasted of the sea) while my flank steak was nicely charred on the outside and medium rare as I had requested (though thicker than I prefer). My girlfriend's beef carpaccio and white sausage were both very good and large in size.  We were too stuffed to enjoy any dessert but would expect them to be very tasty (and affordable).

Service was friendly but the restaurant did seem a bit understaffed as our waitress was definitely running around a lot despite being calm and polite when she spoke with us. 

Overall, I would definitely would return."}
{"text":"disappointing. As a subsidiary of the Europea I would have expected better. Food was not tasteful to say the least. The salad is actually over date. The ambiance also outdated"}
{"text":"J'ai essayé le tartare. Il était parfaitement assaisonné. La présentation était parfaite et le service chaleureux et efficace. Allez l'essayer."}
{"text":"I had my favorite meal in Montreal at Beaver Hall (no rhyme intended). Originally, I was set to go to Europea, the chi-chi restaurant owned by the same chef. However, I was a little too meat and potatoes for that place and promptly left. Beaver Hall however was way more up my alley. Less pretentious, this place has everything you could ask for from flank steak, lobster risotto,  french onion soup and more. Reasonable prices for a nice restaurant. The service was super friendly too. The food...well, delicious. I had the flank steak with shallots, mesclun greens and frites. Then I finished it off with creme brulee. If I ever go back to Montreal, this place will definitely be on my list."}
{"text":"The food was awful!! I ordered a steak and it was completely burnt!! A dry piece of meat I would say! By the end of the night I paid around $70 for my wine, steak and very low quality dessert and I regret it for my whole life! Ive been in lots of places in Montreal and this was one of the worst ones!! Never ever go there!!"}
{"text":"We enjoyed a relaxing dinner here after a long day sightseeing in Montreal.  Cozy, casual atmosphere; excellent, unpretentious service; delicious food and wine.  Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Excellent service très bonne bouffe un intéressant brunch pour un dimanche ensoleiller comme aujourd'hui"}
{"text":"We have been here twice in the evenings and the food and service are excellent. This has to be my favourite place for beef tartare, so tasty with the wasabi peas for crunch. Everything we have had here was excellent, including the fries and the tartinate for the bread. The creme brulee for one can easily be shared by two. 

While I am not usually a fan of bistro, Beaver Hall does it right. The plating is excellent, the portions are right and the wait staff are on the ball. Being that this is located in a busy business district, right across the street from Bell Canada's head office, I would imagine that this place must be clattering with business people for lunch and busy. But in the evening the pace is excellent and you can sit and enjoy a meal, looking out from the window onto Beaver Hall Hill."}
{"text":"The restaurant was described by our hotel concierge as \"a consummate Montreal lunch place\", so we went on that advice.  It was very crowded and full of life, but the wait staff was a bit too busy to spend much time with us.  Also, I was a bit put off by the fact that the glass of wine we ordered was pretty darn skimpy - the waiter poured the remains of the bottle into the glass at the table - we could have said something, but it would have been awkward.

The food was very good, but very rich and filling for lunch...I couldn't imagine going back to work after eating all that.

Overall, I think there are better lunch places in the city."}
{"text":"This is an excellent restaurant with good service and a creative menu.  We went with our grandchildren and it had something for everyone.  The youngest had the BBQ and was very happy.  The pappardelle was excellent as well.  My grandson and the steak...it came rarer than he asked for but he was happy with it anyway.  My octopus was a bit salty but the deserts were divine!"}
{"text":"The concierge at the hotel recommended this restaurant, so on faith we accepted her suggestion and we are very glad we did! Such a cute place, with a great wine list, excellent ambiance, and the food was delicious. The fish & chips were some of the best I've ever had: lightly battered and with rosemary instead of dill in the tartar sauce. So good! Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Came here for my Mum's birthday with both my parents, wife and 4 year old. The space is a lot more open and bright than it appears in the pictures they posted online. Service is friendly and attentive. The food is phenomenal. Like most places in Montreal the wine is pretty expensive. It's all good stuff, but more than I'd typically pay for comparable quality in the US. The food on the other hand is astonishingly good value for money. 

For starters we sampled soup, salmon, and foie. For mains my parents had liver, while I had lobster mac and cheese. My wife ordered the pike. The lobster mac and cheese was really rich (in a great way). Unlike other places like this they have a good children's menu, and were great with my son."}
{"text":"For some reason I had been avoiding having lunch here for some time, which I can now say was a mistake on my part. I recently had lunch there and the food was excellent. The gazpacho was the best that I ever had and the tuna tataki, which was accompanied by a wonderful lightly battered cucumber and avocado roll. My friend had the bavette which he said was excellent. 

Both the food and service were great, however the decore could use some updating, the booths are a bit tight and it would be nice to have a bit more space to sit back and enjoy food."}
{"text":"I liked both the atmosphere and the food at this place-- very fun. I was dining alone on a busy night for them, but they were super nice & accommodating. Definitely a bustling place-- not quiet, and the service is a bit frantic, but I didn't find it inattentive at all. I had the Parmesan-crusted calamari, which were quite nice as an appetizer. For the entree I had the ballotine of guinea fowl with rapini, butternut squash risotto and garlic cream. The garlic cream and risotto were both delicious, and the guinea fowl was quite nice, though just a tad bit dry for my taste. I don't know what one of the other commenters is talking about when saying there is no drink menu, since I was given one with wine by the glass and the bottle. The only thing I would do differently was the dessert-- the profiteroles were not the best I'd ever had... I think they'd been sitting a bit long. Next time I'd try the crepes suzette. :)"}
{"text":"Traditional French Bistro!  Yea!  I mean...\"Oui, Oui!\"

Worth visiting...

Complimentary Appetizers...
The table setting provides a cutting board with a knife in which they provide a complimentary boule of French Bread and a pot of cornichon pickles with small tongs.

Ambiance-
Somewhat dark with real candles on each table

Food-
Authentic French Food....there are daily (local) specials...for example, on a Friday night the daily special is Rabbit leg!  If you are adventurous..go for it....otherwise, there are many other options...

SOUP OF THE DAY-Turnip with bacon and maple syrup...unusually unique....it was delicious with the French Bread and the portion was substantial!

My Mami got the Rotisserie Duck which was buttery and tender plated on a bed of salad with pears garnishing it.

I chose the Steak Frites which came with a small french salad and a miniature bottle of dijon mustard and ketchup.

Extensive Wine List...with all French Red and White Wines...many of them available by the glass.

The waitstaff is bilingual and professional-they hang up your coat upon entry and are willing to accommodate guests without a reservation...."}
{"text":"Received graciously and seated in a large but cozy room.  The waiter was rushed but did his job well and helped with suggestions.  Service was quick but not like they were trying to turn the table.  Food was great, although wine list is limited and mostly expensive - not much below $85.  Overall a super experience."}
{"text":"First of all, I think this place is targeted towards senior citizens. I came on a Tuesday night, and I'd say that most of the people were at/ close to retirement age (not saying that this is a good or bad thing.... just something to be aware of). 

The service was not very good. The food took a long time to come out (we waited at least a hour hour). The waiter kind of apologized a little at the very end when he gave us the bill, obviously trying to get a better tip. 

Now for the food, I ordered the veal, which was okay. I really liked the fries though. Wife got the flank steak, which was terrible! It was too burnt on the outside, and there wasn't much flavor. My son got a fish and chips kids meal... the fish also was pretty flavorless. 

Prices were reasonable. 

I will not return"}
{"text":"I really need to write about this place because the service was unforgettably hilariously bad (***granted it was a year ago***). 

Perhaps it was a particularly stressful night for our waiter, but he was generally very short with my group and curt to the point of rudeness. We felt rushed all the way through and each course wasn't coordinated to come at the same time for everyone. The best part was when I ordered the beef tartare. In the most condescending tone I imagine a human being can muster he said \"ya so you know that's raw meat then, right? It's RAW\". 

YUP, THANKS.

I'm really not even mad, but on top of that the food was as 'meh' as it got. The whole experience was less than average. There are too many other more promising places to try in this city to warrant another go and I recommend you skip it too."}
{"text":"As a Montreal native, I take personal offense to sub-par French food and service; and when I tasted Europea's macaron, it was a revelation to the extent that I needed to try their potentially divine cuisine. Europea was sadly booked out for 2 weeks so I settled for Beaver Hall (one of its subsidiaries) hoping it would the chef and the brand justice. 

*sad head shake*

Where did the disappointments start...
1) no Sauternes wine.
2) foie gras was served as part of this weird ravioli filling that in turn was served IN A PLASTIC BAG, which was served IN A GIANT GLASS BOWL with HAM BROTH. This was suspect for a few reasons. For starters, there was spicy sausage, tomato, mushroom, onions and what seemed to be a sundried tomato pasta. All those bold flavors completely overwhelmed the dish and made the foie unnecessary. If I wanted a pasta appetizer, I would have ordered one.  If I wanted a soup, I would have ordered one. BUT I ORDERED A FOIE GRAS in a province that produces the best duck and goose in the world bar none. So have the professional and culinary decency to serve it seared properly goddamn it!!! Maybe they were trying to hide the less than fresh liver they had on hand? Who knows. Wouldn't go back there for this offense alone.
3) powdery flesh of the poached European bass. Clearly this fish was previously frozen and thawed for a few days before they served it to me. Blech.
4) over seasoned everything. The butter was salty. The tapenade was salty. The table bread was salty. The salad was salty. When the heck is salad too salty??

The plus sides...

1) decent and attentive wait staff. They were bilingual and served food to our left (a detail typically overlooked in most American restaurants and most non-French restaurants) and picked up empty plates from our right. They weren't hovering uncomfortably nor did they leave our water glasses dry or rush us out the door.
2) beautiful food arrangement. I mean like food porn good. The chef clearly has a good eye for aesthetics. The saffron foam lapped up alongside a perfectly oval shore of fish next to a rectangular block of beautifully scalloped potato layered with evenly minced mushrooms. My mom's fish and chips was served on a wooden board with checkered paper, an ample mesclun salad, a miniature fry basket and tiny jars of ketchup and tartar sauce. My dad had perfect cube vol au vents next to clouds of ris de veau.
3) comfortable seating. We had enough space to sit and lounge but were also near enough other patrons to feel like we were in a homey environment.
4) reasonable wine prices.

Total bill for 3 adults, appetizers, main courses, wine, tax and tip = $191.

So, bottom line, I wouldn't especially go out of my way back there for a romantic date or an important business meeting but if I was in the neighborhood and was feeling a little peckish, I might step in for a small bite (not foie gras though)."}
{"text":"It was ok. I guess I had higher expectations since Europea is one of my favourite restaurants. I'd much rather spend a little more and get a fabulous meal at Europea than to come back here again."}
{"text":"I dont think I've ever had so much difficulty giving a rating to a restaurant. The experience itself was a up and down.

First thing is the food. Most of the food was really good with the exception of the risotto. That one was just ok. The ride was a bit hard which means that the risotto was not cooked long enough.

The service started well but even there it was a rollercoaster. Our waitress was really stressed and that was not giving us a good experience. But the other employee were super nice. Good conversation and they were in a good mood.

The decor looks like a 1950 bistro which is nice. The floor looks damaged but I don't know if that was intentional or not.

All in all a good experience but not the best I've had."}
{"text":"Loved the atmosphere and service. The food is inconsistent. Amuse-Bouche was very strange-emulsified foie gras on the bed of caramelized onions. Except the huge amount of onions totally killed It. 

Salmon tartar appetizer was nice, could use more seasoning. Dumplings with foie gras filling swimming in a savory bullion were devine. 

The main entre - Duo d'agneau du Québec , lamb duet: slow cooked lamb rump, aligot, braised shoulder, spinach, goat cheese and red pepper, black olive sauce. I would stay away from that unless you like goat cheese which overwhelmed everything else on the plate. The other part of that duo was overlooked and bone dry.

The kids menu included stake and other minimized versions of the adult menu. That's a nice surprise for any American eating out with their kids. 

Again, loved the space, the service. A bit overpriced for the quality and type of food."}
{"text":"Nous sommes venus avec les enfants pour le menu spécial relâche 
Nous avons passé une très bonne soirée 
Le service est impeccable 
Le menu parfait, un plat de plus, nous aurions été incapables de finir!
Le menu pour les enfants n est pas le même que pour les adultes mais ils se sont regales avec leur fish and chips plus que copieux et croustillant et une salade en entrée"}

J'y suis allé pendant Montréal à table et je n'ai pas été déçue!
Que ce soit l'entrée (soupe maison), le plat principal (tartare extra!!) et le dessert (tarte citron), tout était vraiment succulent, raffiné et bien présenté! 
Bien situé en centre ville, il y a beaucoup de gens d'affaires, qui sortent des bureaux
C'est bien aussi entre amis ou en couple
Beau décor, bon service
A essayer!"}
{"text":"Je suis allée avec mes parents et l'experience était magnifique. Le service a été génial et le resto est très bien decoré. Le tartare et la morue étaient parfaitement assaisonnés et on nous a offert de la crétonnade comme cadeau! (On l'a gouté pendant le repas, et exceptionnel aussi). Par rapport aux desserts, on a demandé le ménu, et le serveur nous a dit: je vais mieux vous montrer les desserts, et il nous a emmené un plateau rempli de gateaux! Impossible de dire non! Service impecable mème si on est arrivés au resto à 14h30-15h. Je repeterai!!"}
{"text":"Beaver Hall was recommended by our hotel as a mid-priced restaurant. I had wanted to try Europa, but it's out of my price range, so I thought Beaver Hall would be a good substitute since it's owned by Europa. We had a 6pm reservation, which was very early. Since we were the only people there, the service was great.

I ordered the Risotto, which they suggest as a meal. I added the pulled pork, green asparagus and sautéed mushrooms. The base is $20 and each add on costs more, so in total it was about $32. The Risotto was good, but it definitely shouldn't have been an entree. It should be a side split between two people. The risotto is too rich to eat as an entree and it became too heavy and monotonous in flavor.

My husband ordered the flank steak, which came with french fries and a garden salad ($25.50).  There wasn't anything exceptional or memorable about this meal.

The bottles of red wine start at $45, and we also ordered one to complement our meal. I'm normally a huge fan of dessert, but when they brought the tray over, not a single one appealed to me. My husband got a strawberry cheesecake which came in a plastic cup and was smothered in strawberry sauce. 

Overall, I wasn't impressed with our meal and I wouldn't return."}
{"text":"Great start to my stay in Montreal.
Ambience: Nice, classy restaurant with a French flair. A good place for a special or intimate dinner.
Service: My only slight negative - fairly friendly but a little snooty. I ordered in French but apparently my pronunciation wasn't good enough as the waiters always felt the need to correct me. Funny, I've never had a problem in France...
Food: Fantastic. I had the confit de canard (duck) which was that rare dish that was simply flawless - a beautiful balance of flavors and the perfect portion size. The desserts were also a nice surprise, with a little more variation than you normally see in french restaurants. it did however, have Crepe Suzette cooked table-side which some people might find a little cheesy. Also, I see that one of the other reviewers found their amuse-bouche a little strange. I was given a different one which was also a little unusual and probably not worth the effort. As for the wines, the wine list is okay but not many are available by the glass. Fortunately they did know what a Kir Royale was, so it didn't matter much to me.
Price: As is typical for French restaurants it's a little above normal but in this case it was worth it.
I'd go back if I come back to Montreal."}
{"text":"Restaurant où nous commençons à avoir nos habitudes. La carte est intéressante mais le hic, est qu'elle ne se renouvelle pas assez souvent. 
Toutefois les plats sont véritablement savoureux. 
Le rapport qualité prix y est excellent selon moi. 
Un des restaurants que je préfère."}
{"text":"Came here for a solo dinner while on business. The food is pretty authentic French. Has the beef shoulder which was pretty good but the lighting way to bright for a classy dinner."}
{"text":"Nous avions réservé par le biais d'\"accès resto\" ce qui nous a permis de bénéficier de -25% sur notre note (valable seulement sur la bouffe)
J'ai été agréablement surprise d'être accueillie par un maître d'hôtel, qui nous a pris nos manteaux et nous a accompagné à notre table. Petite banquette romantique avec bougie... Nous nous installons et sur la table il y a un pot de cornichons, sympa! Le chef de rang nous apporte les cartes et nous cite de vive voix les spécialités du jour qui ne sont pas sur la carte.
Pour l'entrée mon copain opte pour une crème brûlée de fromage de chèvre, un mélange sucré salé, excellent. Je choisi les calmars en croute de parmesan. C'est fin, c'est bon!! 
Quand au plat principal mon choix se porte sur les gnocchis au parmesan et champignons et sa réduction de truffes. Que dire à part; omg!! Pour vrai ce sont les meilleurs gnocchis que j'ai jamais mangés! Fondant en bouche, la sauce au parmesan est parfaite et que dire de l'émulsion de truffe? Merveilleuse! Et la poëlëe de champignons est assaisonnée à la perfection. 
Mon copain lui choisi le boudin, il a vraiment aimé ça aussi... 
Quand aux desserts, le serveur nous apporte sur un plateau tout un choix de verrines, c'est vraiment difficile de se décider! Pour moi ce sera chocolat pistache. Est-il utile de dire que c'était un délice? Mon cheum lui prend celle à la vanille et crème fouetté. Il se régale aussi!
Le service est parfait, les serveurs aux petits soins, et cerise sur le gâteau, cadeau de la maison, un pot de creton que l'on rapporte chez nous! 
Finalement nous en avons pour un bon 105$, entrée plat dessert et un verre de vin chacun. (avec la ristourne de -25% sur la bouffe)
Je recommande vivement le beaver hall si vous avez le goût de vous faire bien servir et de manger une belle et bonne \"bistronomie\". Prochaine étape pour nous; l'Europea! (Nous commençons à économiser haha!)"}
{"text":"Went there for Afternoon Tea (by Europea) last Saturday after purchasing a Groupon.

I had been to Birk's Afternoon Tea a few years ago, which was by Europea as well and I had a marvelous experience: food and service was very good.

This time though, not so much. Took forever to have service, they were barely seen throughout the experience and it took forever to get the bill at the end. The food was clearly made in advance, just waiting to be plated and served, the scones were dry!!!! that is, I think, a punishable offence in the UK! And the tea was barely warm when it got to our table.

I appreciated the opportunity to spend time with my friend, but will not go there again, even at a discount price!"}
{"text":"Courteous Staff, Friendly Service, Comfortable ambience, Delicious Food!"}
{"text":"Amazing service! Incredible food. Loved their homemade pate! Their beef tartare and fries was delicious as well."}
{"text":"Very pleasant atmosphere in downtown Montreal. The staff was welcoming and the food was delicious. We ordered the foie gras and goat cheese creme brulee as apps and they were both great, but the foie gras was a favorite! I ordered the sea bass with squid ink ravioli for my main dish -- the sea bass proportion was rather small, but very tasty. I didn't care for the ravioli but it was definitely worth a try! Overall, it was a great start to our vacation in Montreal."}
{"text":"Welcome groups very easily with a reservation.

Food was very generous, but the only flaw is that the taste is not up to par for the price we paid.

I ordered an Entrée of Calamari, which was excellent, not too oily, and was just crispy enough.

Ordered a Beef Tartare as a meal and that was what was missing. The taste was just a bit subpar compared to some other competitors.

Although, would love to come back."}
{"text":"Our first night in Montreal and Yelp led us to this lovely French Bistro restaurant.  They were 40 minutes from closing but welcomed us warmly.  

Girls had Prosecco and red wine and the boys had glasses of local beer. Bread and olive oil was served throughout the meal. I dined on a delicious shrimp dish. Service was attentive without being overbearing."}
{"text":"Be sure to check your bill before you pay.

The evening went quite well for the most part. We had a large group of 20 people and they accommodated us fairly quickly. So if you are starving and you want your food served fast, this place is great.

Menu selection was alright. We came here because there was a $35 set menu. Apparently there are restrictions as tho which items you can select for the $35 or $45 set menu between appetizers, entree and desserts... They didn't state this on their website.

Wine and drink menu, none. You kind of have to ask them until they have something you want. Even when I requested for a glass of white, they didn't ask me from where, or taste preference, neither do they provide a list of the cost by the glass or by the bottle. Not happy about that and they don't let you try the wine before they pour you the entire glass. Fine, no big deal, maybe it was a Montreal tradition...

I was quite upset that our service deteriorated as the night went on because we had no sight of our server to refill water and he over charged my and my friend 3 extra glasses of wine. He made the correction, but it took a while before he came back with our bills and change. Is it REALLY that hard on an electronic system these days?

The food itself wasn't bad. I liked the fillet mignon and I also got the opportunity to try the beef tartare, salmon brioche, and the Duck Confit. The portion of the Duck Confit wasn't very large. It's served like a quarter chicken dinner with drumstick and thigh bone on a bed of mashed potatoes and sauce. I had ordered a separate appetizer before hand, ate a lot of bread, and I didn't order it with the set menu, I was told the entrée portions were slightly smaller if you order with the menu. The beef tartare looked like it was a good portion though. I think it really depends on what you order.

I could come back, but not at the top of my list."}
{"text":"I was at Beaver Hall this evening and I was very impressed. The food was very good and the service was even better.  I dined alone and the waiter and the maitre'd made me feel very comfortable and they were very attentive which doesn 't often happen when you dine alone.  I had the steak tatare which was very good and it came with a salad, which was nicely dresses and wonderful French fries.  I almost never eat french fries as I don't really like them, but these were wonderful.  I had the Baba au Rum for dessert and it was a little heavy but good.  I enjoyed the lively atmospher as the resteraurant was up beat and lively, it was not stuffy.  The place was filled with locals and the dress was casual.  I wish I had another day in town, I would dine here again."}
{"text":"Excellent service and a great meal. We had reservations on a Tuesday night with a 2 and a half year old in tow and they couldn't have been more accommodating. My wife and I both ordered off the special menu and what a great deal with a soup/salad, entree and half a bottle of wine for 35 bucks. Both my beef carpaccio and my wife's canellonis were excellent. The wine was delicious as well as they selected a very nice Pinot to complement the meal. Best of all was the kids meal. My son has never eaten so well for less than 10 bucks. He received a half portion of the canellonis, a drink, and an excellent desert. They brought his meal out right away which was great because it provided a great distraction. Also compliments of the house were a delicious olive tapenade and a guacamole with fish. I would definitely come back and would love to give a big thank you to Michele and the rest of the staff for allowing us to have a nice meal in Montreal even with our son in tow."}
{"text":"One of the easiest Yelp reviews I have had the pleasure of writing:  BEST meal of the vacation, no question.   With a decor that straddles a beer hall-library theme hybrid, courteous and smiling waiters & waitress, and dishes bursting with flavor from start to finish, Beaver Hall created a wholly memorable dining experience.  From the amuse-bouche of sweet potato fries to the pan-table savory olive spread, all dishes delivered straightforward and excellent cooking. The croquette fromagiére appetizer -- soft cheese with lightly fried outer dough, creamy and warm on the inside and slightly crispy on the outside --  and gnocchi -- flavorful and easily the best dish of the meal -- are clear winners though I expect many more of the dishes to be delicious.  My girlfriend and I ordered the pinot grigio to pair with the mains.  For dessert, we ordered the chocolate mousse with a dry, fruity wine recommended to us by the sommelier.  The sommelier and waitress were both extraordinarily friendly; the waitress even, on her own time, spent a few minutes introducing my girlfriend and me to a few popular sites to visit.  I cannot write a single negative about this experience:  Beaver Hall.  5/5.  Done."}
{"text":"Overall a regular eatery, which provides a warm environment for a get-together with friends.  

The thing that strikes me most about this place is that the portions are generous.  This goes for their trademark fish and chips, and even the duck breast confit."}
{"text":"I remember went to this place and had a bad experience. Neither me or my friend could finish what we order..."}
{"text":"This was the first place that we dined at on our trip.  Bless the staff because I think we were a little punch-drunk from the very early flight and being the only ones in the place since it was 3:30.  My friend and I had to start with some bubbly.  It was great.  Then we moved to other glasses of wine.  My other friend got some beer.
We started with the fried calamari which was terrific.  Not fishy or greasy at all.  I loved the dipping sauces, but get it for the adorable lemon squeezer boat thingy. The highlight was the bruleed goat cheese with arugula on top.  OMG that was crazy good.  I've had a cheese souffle but never creme brulee style!  We were practically licking the dish.  My friend got the fish and it was the winner.  Very well prepared.  I got the salmon tartar and my other friend got the beef version.  His came w/ fries.  Mine was this very generous amount of smoked salmon in little cubes with avocado, some bagel chips, capers etc.  It was really good but maybe better served smaller as a starter.
At this point its nearly 5.  Nearly dinner service time.  We saw the staff having their meeting and setting up the crepe station.  The service was great however we had 3 different waiters.  It made us feel a little weird.  So they offered us some fruit for dessert.  PASS!  I felt we were so close to dinner why not offer the dinner desserts minus the crepes?  If it had been something chocolatey I would have gone for it.  But we paid and went on our very merry way."}
{"text":"This is a special place.  We normally don't eat French food since we are trying to cut down on rich foods.  Beaver Hall had a nice selection of items that can be healthy so we had a mix. We started off with the Tartare de saumon à la lime et wakamé, aeufs de tobiko et réduction de soya (Salmon tartare with lime and wakamé, tobiko caviar and soya reduction.)  The flavors and presentation was exquisite.

We split the duck entree -- Cuisse de canard confite, röstis de panais, petite salade de roquette et gastrique aux framboises (Confit duck leg, parsnip rösti, aragula salad and rasberry gastric).   This was exceptionally prepared and melted in our mouths.

But food alone doesn't make a five star restaurant.  On top of good food the servers were attentive and made us feel at home.

Should I say we had flambé Crepe Suzettes?   The servers prepare them in the middle of the restaurant which makes a nice show for all.

If you are looking for a special Montreal restaurant, we recommend Beaver Hall.

{"text":"Idéal pour le lunch du midi entre collègues. Les prix sont abordables pour la qualité des produits. Menu intéressant et les plats sont bons. Le service est sympatique."}
{"text":"Came here on Friday of the august long weekend after recommendation from my airbnb host. Lovely French place, we made a reservation online but could have easily walked in like we saw several other couples do. Service was great, our waiter started us off with a nice loaf of bread and gave great wine recommendations. We got the meat board to start and it had a great variety of pickled items and meats. Me and my date both got the hangar steak with potatoes and vegetables and it was amazing! Overall a great experience and would definitely return next time I'm in Montreal!"}
{"text":"Another restaurant recommendation from the hotel... we were able to walk there from our downtown location.  It's funny how small Montreal really is... 

They are right about this place.. they are not too careful with the billing.  The waitress also mischarged us for a beer we did not get.  She did apologize.. as well as for the steak she delivered to us as well done instead of medium.  The beef carpaccio was really good though.. as were the mussels.  Way better than what they serve in the States with a large quantity.

I really liked the wine that I got as well.. delicious.

Not as good as Bonaparte but not bad.

The scene is like a noisy beer hall with the look of Cheers inside.  Not totally romantic.. but nice."}
{"text":"Almost very good. The hotel told us this was owned by one of Montreal's top Chefs. Granted we arrived without reservations on a rainy Tuesday night, but were not greeted warmly. Once seated a small loaf of bread arrived cool and rubbery. 

The entries were good , but not great like our server."}
{"text":"We arrived around 8pm on a Wednesday and there were only 4 other occupied tables.  In contrast, we had eaten at Bonaparte on Monday at the same time and they were turning people away. 

Our meal was fine and the service was fine.  We both ordered the risotto and were surprised to find that it had clearly come from the same pot.  I had ordered shrimp and mushroom - those were placed like a garnish on the top of a bowl of plain risotto.  My husband had the same bowl of plain risotto garnished with asparagus and shrimp.  Granted the risotto was very cheesy and tasty, but given the time it took to arrive the kitchen could have made it to order (especially since the restaurant was so empty).  I've never been served obviously mass produced risotto before.

The food was reasonably priced but they clearly make their profit on the wines.  There were very few wines under $50 (CAD)"}
{"text":"Great spot for a very good, yet quick lunch. Try the tartars or go for the daily apetizer or entrees. Good food, service and price."}
{"text":"Very nice, nice service, but the food is heavy like for winter. Overcooked and heavy. They even managed to make the fish heavy. Looks like they have good fries. Good quality but too bad. The magret of duck was cooked too quickly so the fat still thick and the meat tough and undercooked. Could be good this was only one try. Maybe better for steak frites. $10 glass of wine: first pour was stingy but another waiter served us a nice glass."}
{"text":"The food was fantastic. Service was unobtrusive. The lamb dish was cooked to perfection, and being. A goat cheese lover, I enjoyed the side that came with it. The ratatouille lasagne was fantastic as well, and I loved the truffle emulsion with it. Dessert - we tried the creme brûlée and it was classic goodness.

I'll be back if possible for the food."}
{"text":"Nous sommes allés pour un souper d'affaire, très bon service, belle ambiance et menu alléchant qui sait plaire à tous. La cuisine a même adapté un plat pour accommoder une collègue avec des allergies. Tous ont apprécié leur repas et nous y retournerons !"}
{"text":"I was welcomed right away. I was seated and was served complimentary bread and butter and cornichon. I ordered a steak, medium well, and frites, and the food was delicious and cooked perfectly. It was apparent that the cook took time to prepare everything just right and I appreciated that. They also provided dijon mustard which was delicious. The service was great and the ambiance was comfortable. I would recommend this place if you're in the area."}
{"text":"great food and service! the grilled octopus melts in your mouth. Many people ask for the crepes suzzette which they prepare table side so be ready for lots of flames in the dining room :)"}
{"text":"Exceeded expectations. Our waitress Jessie was a delight. The food was Cosmopolitan French with a twist. Who knew there is savory Goat Cheese Creme brûlée, don't miss this amazing appetizer. ."}
{"text":"Thoroughly enjoyed this restaurant. Great filet, wonderful foie gras, and a great macaroon dessert. I enjoyed the Fois Gras appetizer, the Filet with devine mashed potatoes and perfect maroons for desert. Highly recommend this for anyone looking for an authentic french meal. I honestly thought I was back in France."}
{"text":"Très belle place pour un brunch de très bonne qualité. Repas dans un cadre très calme. Nous y sommes allés par le biais d'un bon Tuango qu'on nous avait offert, et nous sommes repartis avec des produits du restaurant et un beau tablier."}
{"text":"Beaver Hall est un très bon choix pour le lunch, assez généreux, plein d'attentions (les pickles, la tapenade...), une carte intéressante, belle exécution. Pas guindé mais rigoureux, un très bon rapport qualité-prix. Je le recommande."}
{"text":"I went there for lunch with a friend. The service was great but the food was ok. Their most popular dishes seem to be the salmon and beef tartare. I ordered the salmon tartare and my friend ordered a beef tartare. Given it's a French restaurant, I was a bit surprised that the salmon tartare had such an Asian cuisine influence."}
