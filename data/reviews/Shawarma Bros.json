{"text":"I came upon this place in a roundabout way.

I actually visited first, THEN looked it up...
Strange I know, but I was hanging out at a friends house a few blocks from the nearby mall on Vic park and felt like getting some food.
Pizza or burgers seemed too mundane, and for some reason wild wings was unappealing to her.
So she brought me here, I had only had king shawarma back in Oakville, so I had a rather skewed opinion of shawarma being greasy and overcondimented.
But I trusted her.

The place itself is ok, unassuming.
The shawarma inside of a pita, not rolled like a burrito, was new to me.
I didn't recognize some of the ingredients, like pickled turnips, but opted for the works since I like to give everything at least a try.
It is incredible, not overly heavy, and compared to my other preferred snack of a burrito, quite reasonably priced.
I frequent this place quite often.

On a side note, I found these reviews since one day I went and it was closed for some unscheduled maintenance so I wanted to lookup their number.
Not I call ahead to make sure they are open and to order ahead.

Love this place"}
{"text":"Best shawarma place out there. The shawarma is always fresh and very delicious. Its always full and the customer service is just another bonus. I got the chicken shawarma they have and compared to so many other places, considering their price it is such high quality. You'll never go wrong!"}
{"text":"New place and offers good shawarma. We tried the beef shawarma sandwich and fattoush salad. Portion is a lot. Owner was there and said he will do some renovation and add new items to the menu."}
{"text":"best shawarma place ever amazimg sauce amazing nice people i always go eat there its amazing"}
{"text":"RATING FOR TAKE OUT LUNCH SPECIAL:

$6.99 for 2 small chicken shawarmas OR 1 shawarma with fries and a drink.

Big chunks of tender chicken and crunchy veggies wrapped in a soft pita. Flavourful and tasty. Clean dining area, quick service. A HUGE bargain, definitely making it onto my $ list."}
{"text":"The chicken shawarma dinner and beef shawarma sandwich were awful. The beef was tough and tasted as if it sat warming in a tray all day, I threw it into the garbage. The chicken was at least edible, but tough and over cooked. The fries were raw, imagine frozen fries deep fried for 30 seconds, just enough to be warm. It was the worst shawarma experience I've had in Toronto. Avoid, there are better offerings around."}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this place since it's on the way home from work. 

I had already had Tasty Shawarma and been driving out of my way to get it and by today's meal I will gladly be going back there. 

I ordered two chicken shawarmas. The food was not great to be honest. Way too many cucumbers. I asked for none and then they proceeded to put on another sauce that was also cucumber based. At this point the girl knew she made a mistake but just passed it off to the other person. I asked her if there were cucumbers in the sauce and she said no. My husband said don't worry and just ate that one and asked for the second one to have no sauce or cucumbers. 

This already put a bad taste in my mouth but I was hopeful that the food would taste okay. Unfortunately it wasn't great.  Chicken was dry, pita was put on a grill press for all of 10seconds. 


To top it off they didn't have napkins and the tables hadn't been cleaned. We just ended up taking it out to our car."}
{"text":"Worst place ever. The owner is extremely cheap, I swear he counted the lettuce he put into our pita bread."}
{"text":"Stopped by this place with a friend on my way to a late night movie... WORST EXPERIENCE EVER!  Needless to say, we will never be going back, and would caution anyone else to avoid this place at all costs.  Over-priced, small portions for a dingy place and extremely rude.

Got there at 9:15pm, lights were on, OPEN sign was lit, and there was a large group of people inside getting takeout so I figured I'd give it a shot.  I asked \"Are you still open\", and the lady answered \"oh yes, what can I get you?\".  We ordered 2 Chicken Kebab/Souvlaki dinners and was told it would be about 5-6 minutes.  Meanwhile I can see the grill is off watching as she turned it on, same with the deep fryer, then the cook/husband came and put the meat on the grill...  No sizzle, no sound whatsoever so the grill was cold.  I could tell this was gonna take longer than 5-6 minutes, but I was willing to wait the 10-15 minutes it should take to cook the chicken properly even 20 minutes including time to let the grill warm up.  Went for a smoke outside, came back 10 mins later and there were more customers inside being served.  
Our food was still on the grill so we sat down to wait.  As other customers are being served I hear one of them getting upset that they are out of toppings for the shwarama and the server refused to get more, \"We closed at 9\" she said angrily \"this is all I have\", and the other customer replied \"well you should have enough ingredients to serve your customers or at least tell them beforehand\".   I couldn't agree more.  Meanwhile, the doors are still WIDE open, with plenty of people inside (incl 2 little kids sitting by themselves, must be family cause they weren't eating just sitting playing games on a laptop), and the OPEN sign was still ON!  
Finally I get up at around 9:45, our food is still not plated (everything was ready, just sitting there) and ask why it's taking so long.  \"Oh, we can't give you raw chicken, this is how long it takes\" was the answer I got, and when I asked why the food was just sitting there and how 5-6 minutes became 30 mins I got a rude, sny remark.... \"No it hasn't been 30 minutes, stop exaggerating.  What do you want from me?\"  
She grabs the containers that have the \"salad\" prepared (about 5 small shreds of lettuce already browned and drenched in dressing so they are all stuck to the bottom of the container, 1/2 a slice of tomato, and 1/2 a slice of cucumber).  Then she gets the fries, which were  out of the fryer when we got back from our smoke and had now been sitting for 20 mins, poured them in to a bowl and divi'd up a tiny portion of maybe half of what was cooked between the 2 containers (not sure what she was saving the rest for), and then takes the containers to the back.  I go to the cash to pay for the food trying to expedite the process, and I can see here putting the rice in the microwave to warm it up.  Finally she comes back puts the meat on (which looks slightly blackened on the outside by this point), asks what sauce we want.  We both ask for Garlic and Hot Sauce, and my friend wanted some hummous with it too, she mumbled something that sounded like \"Yeah, hummous\".  
After packing our food I see she did not add any hummous, and when I reminded her for the third time she started yelling \"YOUR FOOD DOESN\"T COME WITH HUMMOUS... I DONT HAVE ANY HUMMOUS FOR YOU!\".  We were quite surprised someone could yell at their customers like that, especially when we were under the impression that it would be given (I even saw a little hummous in the container she could have given which would have been just enough).  So we said, \"if this is how you treat your customers we will not be coming back here again\".  Well she decided that we didn't deserve her food after that and would not give it back to us even though we already paid.  
We asked nicely for the food so we could leave, and again she refused, so we asked for our money back and the other gentlemen came and couldn't remember what we had just paid...  Then he couldn't add up 2x $13.50 to give to us.  Finally we got our $27 back and left at 9:50 to go to our movie, hungry without any dinner, upset having wasted so much time and extremely unhappy about the whole experience."}
