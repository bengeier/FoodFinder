{"text":"Excellent, meat loaf on Thursdays, Awesome! Friend got the dbl. bacon cheeseburger, said it was the best he has had in the area!"}
{"text":"Not fancy, just good food. Great burgers. Many things fresh made (some things frozen). Best Resturant in Dallas. I love the club sandwich."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick breakfast on a Saturday morning. It was anything but quick. There were only about 8 parties in the restaurant at the time. Took nearly 45 minutes for the food to come out. Our first and last visit to The County Kitchen."}
{"text":"Have not been here in years. Service was prompt and we placed our quickly and got our food in good time. Ham and cheese omelet was very good. Ham was done well and had good flavor. Hash-browns cooked well and crispy. Toast done well and gravy actually had good flavor! Coffee good. Water  has strong chlorine taste. Service very good. Dinning area large and basic comfort. A little warm. Will return!"}
{"text":"Awesome!! Prices are GREAT! Huge variety. Lots of southern food, pintos, corn bread, liver mush, biscuits, pork chops, etc... Large dining room with cafeteria style tables in the center. Perfect for large parties. Looked like they have live music sometimes."}
{"text":"Honestly the food is about 3 stars maybe 4 if you like old style cooking. It's good but nothing to wow you. Very old school place. Although my teenager gives the chili cheese fries 5 stars! The five stars came because of the outstanding service I just witnessed. A family of 7 came in and it's 1 hour til closing. They ordered a corn dog for one of the kids. The waitress came back and said they were out but the manager was going to run to the store to get some! Most mom and pop places would have said we are out and left it at that! Great job!"}
{"text":"Meatloaf is the special on Thursday. That's all that I needed to know to make the drive to Dallas.   Meatloaf, mac 'n cheese, broccoli casserole, two rolls w/butter, unsweetened ice tea.   Food: $5.50, Beverage: $1.59.  The slice of meatloaf was literally the size of a brick. It was good, but the only ingredient was onion, and I like both onions and green peppers in my meatloaf. No problems though because it was hot and fresh and I ate every bite. It was a struggle though because it was a LARGE hunk of meatloaf.   The mac 'n cheese wasn't the very best that I've ever eaten, but it was good and hot, and I enjoyed the dish.  Broccoli casserole was a new item for them. It was made with broccoli, mushrooms, and onions. It needed some seasonings and I soon fixed that with salt and pepper. The appearance was pretty gnarly, but it was delicious.   Rolls are rolls and theirs were fresh and hot. Their butter was Land 'O Lakes.   The sweetener was Splenda and my waitress brought out an entire sugar dispenser full, along with a small pitcher of unsweetened ice tea.  Service? My waitress was named Tina and she was excellent. She had a nice disposition and she left me wanting for nothing. For a long time she was the only employee taking orders and serving the food. There were a lot of other (male) employees standing around, doing what - I couldn't tell you. Finally one of them jumped in to help Tina. This restaurant easily holds 125 diners, so ONE wait person isn't enough.   Cleanliness? 98.0%.  Decor? About as Southern as it gets. There was a 70+ inch TV showing the news, which I enjoyed watching as I waited to order and receive my meal.   The tables are generally large so groups would find this restaurant suits their needs very well.   All of the employees were wearing black \"Best Burger in the County\" t-shirts, so the next time that I'm passing through I'm going to find out if that claim is accurate.    Recommendations? If you disdain Southern country cooking restaurants you need to go elsewhere. This is a no nonsense restaurant that serves country diner staples, breakfast, meat and two blue plate specials, iced tea, and supposedly killer double cheeseburgers. The prices are very reasonable for what one receives. The service from Tina was excellent. I left both happy and stuffed and that's why I drove to Dallas, NC.   PS: They serve Tony's ice cream which is made in Gastonia. Tony's is an institution in the area and they've been in business since 1915."}
{"text":"Ultimate burger, fries, and onion rings were on point. Filled me up perfectly. Burgers are 6 oz patties and bacon was delicious."}
