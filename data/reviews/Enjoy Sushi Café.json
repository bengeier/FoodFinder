{"text":"This sushi joint has all sorts of character, from the decor to the food itself! The sushi is well priced and super delicious. The customer service in this place is bar none thee most excellent I've had over the past few months, very warm and very inviting.Something that really sets them apart from the run of the mil \"lunch special\" sushi, is the fact that they have dank coffee and also bomb ass sushi. If had to rate between 1 and 10, it would get an eleven!"}
{"text":"This place has excellent sushi and the owner is very nice and friendly. It's the best sushi on the west side. If you live downtown it is worth the drive. The price is right for their happy hour and you can get really great deals!!"}
{"text":"I wanted to get away from fast food at westgate and I was on my break so I decided to head on over! The staff is so incredibly nice and helpful! Even when I order the tea too late, they have it to me for free (which I added in a tip) and try got my food out quickly! Now, I'm new to sushi so I decided to get the bento box and oh my gosh! It was amazing! The spicy teriyaki beef is my favorite and the California rolls are so amazing! Now whenever I have a break, I'll probably head over there! P.s. I'm obsessed with the tea! This is my new favorite place!"}
{"text":"Great little place me and my girlfriend decided to go to after working at the stadium. Food was great! Staff was great! And the food was great!! I will be coming back every time I'm back out here!!!"}
{"text":"Well where to start first let me say they have crazy hours are not open past 7 o'clock??so today we finally caught up with them the sushi was not good-and the service was even worse. We ordered iced tea and they didn't have any sugar and then didn't even know what sweet and low was. I think owner dug out a couple of sugar packets from her purse I swear no lie we ordered the average sushi California roll etc. etc. and we ordered the crunchy crab roll but guess what there was no crunch on we asked if it was supposed to be crunchy he said yes and walked away we also ordered a A beef teriyaki roll but they had no beef so then we said fine give us a chicken teriyaki roll apparently they had chicken but there wasn't any teriyaki on it at this point we just wanted to leave but we couldn't because their computers were down and they couldn't except debit cards they failed to tell us this before we ordered any food so I had to leave my wife there and tried to find ATM to find cash to pay the bill they should do everyone a favor and stay close more often..."}
{"text":"Sushi very good. Highly recommended. Very nice service. We're from LA and will be making this a regular stop on our AZ trips."}
{"text":"This place is the best in the area.  The other locations around the glendale area, including the good awful El Takaki right next door do not even come close to this spot.  There bowls are also very tasty.  Coming from California via New York, my expectations are high.  This is the only location, so far, that meets my standards."}
{"text":"You won't find any better Sushi on westside. I'll be back for sure. The three rolls I ate were spicy tuna, red Fiji, baked salmon rolls. This place is a home run."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!!! There are so many sushi places that charge a lot for so little, but Enjoy Sushi Caf√© gives you outstanding, fresh sushi at a fraction of the cost of what you would pay elsewhere. The service is outstanding too! This place not only has sushi, but it also has a wonderful selection of coffees and teas, as well as teriyaki bowls, wraps, and salads. I go to this place at least once a week. It's a real treat and healthy too!"}
{"text":"I dont know where they were going with the menu but it is all over the place. You walk in and can really figure out what you're supposed to do sit down or order at the counter like a fast food place. The food tasted horrible the chicken seems re-heated and chewy. I will not be back anytime soon!"}
{"text":"This place has delicious sushi.  It's a small place and only a few employees. They are very personable and polite with the service.  

I don't leave many reviews, but felt like I should for this place. You won't be disappointed. 

Fiji roll is amazing!"}
{"text":"This place is great before a Coyotes game. The staff is friendly and the food was great!
No alcohol, but they are applying. They close at 7 so get there early. We especially enjoyed the eel roll. We were visiting from LA and the owner was so kind and engaging. Thanks!"}
{"text":"It was my first time here, and I got the Red Fiji roll. It was great.  I will definitely come back and try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"The owner is very nice and the cafe is very clean. I've been here several times and the sushi never disappoints. I recommend the crunchy crab roll and the tiger roll, if I had to choose a couple. Will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Excellent service, exceptional sushi, great prices! This is a great, casual, lunch spot! We will definitely come back, plus they deliver to the Westgate area!"}
{"text":"First timer & I'm sure we'll become regulars! Hidden in a small plaza outside the shopping center. Staff was welcoming, friendly, extremely helpful with menu descriptions & went above & beyond. My son cannot tolerate the texture of rice. The staff recommended a chicken teriyaki wrap. I was concerned if it would fill up my 13 yr old. He said yes & I was happily surprised to see that they created a cucumber chicken roll on the side for my son. On the house! My daughter & I share a couple rolls & had to take a 3rd to go because we were full. Fresh, great texture, sauce was perfect $ portions were plenty! I actually cannot wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"The other day was the first time trying out this new restaurant, that replaced the coffee/pastry shop. 

Owner is very welcoming and her sushi is delicious.  Much better than other sushi restaurants around the city.  

I tried the Eel and Vegetable Roll as well as the Crunchy Crap Roll - so good!!  Definitely recommend the Eel or Crunchy Crab... Never been a fan of Vegetable Sushi.  The Shrimp Tempura Bowl is delish as well.  So is their Vanilla Latte - will be trying the Americano next time!!

Enjoy Sushi Cafe - thank you for you yummy food and coffee."}
{"text":"Tiny little joint an easy walk from the Renaissance Hotel.  Nice guys behind the counter. No real sushi bar, just some small tables. Order and chef brings your plate out.  Pretty elegant service.  No frills, good food.  They deserve your business."}
{"text":"Great sushi with excellent variety and service for such an affordable price! Enjoyed my experience here!!!"}
{"text":"Best in the city, sushi at a affordable price. Owner gives a 20% military/veteran discount. 
They can make sushi the way you like it. We love the tuna lover, and spicy tuna rolls. The place gives a welcoming feeling, and has a fun atmosphere.  Kids are welcome, its a chill environment,  I don't have to wear a tux and go broke to enjoy, fresh delicious sushi."}
{"text":"This places was awesome so I was sad to learn on my 5th visit there it has since been shut down. The inside of the building is gutted and their line will ring forever since no one is in there. I discovered this 6/1/15. Hopefully they reopen elsewhere.. Delicious sushi, great prices, and super friendly employees. Sigh."}
{"text":"Sushi is good and the employees are super welcoming! They offer 20% military discount and they also deliver. If you are looking for a place to get sushi quick I suggest this place!"}
{"text":"Fast food sushi place. 

PROS:
1. Nice owner
2. Cute decor

CONS:
1. Fish wasn't fresh 
2. Limited selection of fish - salmon, tuna, eel, and shrimp the day I was there"}
{"text":"We just so happened to come across this spot when we were in town, it's fantastic!! I enjoyed the atmosphere the sushi was delicious and the prices were reasonable!! Our server, it turns out he's from where my boyfriend and I are from!! He was great with his recommendations!! After a whole day of craving sushi, this place didn't disappoint!! It's great, can't wait to visit Arizona again and come here!"}
{"text":"Best sushi on the west side. Have had the spicy tuna, crunchy crab, Hawaiian roll, avocado roll, and rainbow roll. Service was wonderful. Owner came and checked on us once and had a great conversation!"}
{"text":"Fresh, staff makes excellent recommendations.  A very happy place with the best sushi I've had in ages.  Our new favorite spot.  Only things that could possibly make it a little better would be if sake was available, and if a small plate was served ( I like something to eat over since I drop food sometimes using chopsticks) overall loved it!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for affordable sushi in the Westgate area, look no further!  They had a deal of 5 rolls for $30 and it was a great value.  The rolls were fresh and well-prepared.  It is more of a fast-casual concept so this may not be a great choice if you're looking for a \"restaurant experience.\"  

Excellent!"}
{"text":"We were very pleasantly surprised. The prices are fantastic. The food is amazing and you get quite a bit of food. They brought samples of other food items they have and were incredibly good to us. We have definitely found our new sushi spot!! We love it here!!"}
{"text":"This is our favorite new sushi place! We have tried about 5 rolls now between two trips and they haven't missed a beat. The little appetizer they give you is free and delicious, and I don't even like cucumbers! Service is always on point and with a smile.. We will be regulars!! Fresh sushi, great flavors and variety.. Five stars!"}
{"text":"Had a philly and a crunchy crab roll.  Better than I expected it would be.  Place is really small.  20 people seating.  Ordered.  They brought me out a pre sushi item to get my mouth going.  The sushi was very fresh and the presentation was great. Quite a lot of food.  Good portion size. Then they brought some fruit after I was finished to cleanse my pallet!  Wow.  Very nice!   I will come again.  Totally unexpected from such a small place.   I hope this place stays open.  Some Restaurants around it are closed down."}
{"text":"Everything is made fresh. The customer service is outstanding. They are always on there A game. I never thought I would like sushi. The biggest thing is the sushi is not over fishy. Everybody should come here and eat"}
{"text":"First time and actually first meal in Arizona. I ordered the poke salad which was delicious, light and very fresh tasting. If I had one criticism, it would be that \"Poke Salad\" is a bit of a misnomer. It was more of a tuna sashimi salad with a siracha kick. That wouldn't stop me from ordering it again."}
{"text":"Small delicious chill place! Went there for the first time today. The people working were beyond friendly and the food was on point! This is one of my new favorite sushi places in Glendale!  If your looking for a small cool place this is it.  They also have a bunch of coffee on the menu, but I didn't try it.  Well be coming back, thanks for good food and a great time."}
{"text":"Outstanding service. Was greeted in a friendly and curreous manner. Owner hooked it up with free miso soup and small desert. Food was prepared with love and was delicious!"}
{"text":"Very good sushi... Surprising place... Nice people but they should have full wait service instead of ordering at the counter. Other than that, no complaints. Kabuki is right across the parking lot but their quality is not as good."}
{"text":"Really really fresh sushi. If you typically go to Kabuki on Westgate, please please try this too - you wont be disappointed. 

Style is like your typical order in counter and they bring you your food. It's right next to a newly opened mexican japanese fusion restaurant (menu reminds me of Senor Sushi) but opted to try Enjoy Sushi Cafe first because the decor seemed so bright, happy, and inviting. Menu is posted outside too if you're undecided and their specialty rolls looked bomb.

Walked in and got greeted by the very friendly owner who helped us pick and gave recommendations. She also offers to customize your sushi the way you like it if you dont like a certain element in it/want to add something extra. I tried the rolls she recommended (crunchy crab roll = crowd favorite; red fiji roll = she apparently won an award for) and they were sooo yummy and fresh. She'd go around and chat with customers too to see how they like her food - yay for small businesses!

Love this place and will def come back to try the other menu items."}
{"text":"I love this place. It's clean and the owner is very nice. My favorite is the red fiji roll. Yum!"}
{"text":"Overall, I liked it here. It's a small space, but not many people were there. The workers were very attentive. They gave my sister and I a free tasting of cucumber salad and grapefruit slices for dessert. Prices are reasonable; I ate 3 rolls for $20. The sushi was very fresh. The option to tip before receiving food and service was a bit off-putting. I also found it kind of odd to mix sushi with coffee (they also serve coffee, tea, and blended iced drinks), but maybe it works for some people. I didn't try the coffee."}
{"text":"This is a cute little spot to fix your sushi craving. To my surprise there's a lot of food options -- bento, salads, wraps (non-seaweed), rice bowls and even coffee drinks! I'll definitely be coming back"}
{"text":"You will be impressed and surprised when you try the sushi here. I know I was. Yes, I followed the yelp reviewers who all had good things to say. And that's the reason I gave it a shot. But the people there were also incredibly friendly. The service was fantastic. And the sushi was better than most for less money than most places. 

Not sure if I just got lucky or not but I also had a little appetizer that was a fun and different (and free) start and then had a desert with apples with some mango on top of it that was far better than that sounds. Great place all around. You've got to try this out!"}
{"text":"Great experience! Sushi was delicious, and the gentleman helping us was wonderfully helpful. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"So we were driving though Glendale on our way to the Grand Canyon. We wanted to eat something that wasn't deep fired and this place was very refreshing. The sushi was  fresh and tasty the workers were super nice to me and my kids!!  we also enjoyed the price very affordable."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time last week after reading some great reviews. I was not disappointed. The owners were very friendly and I asked what their most unique roll was and they recommended the Red Fuji roll. We ordered that and two other rolls. We were NOT disappointed. I LOVED the Red Fuji roll, which was a little spicy and a bit sweet with these little crunchy things on them that I think may have been tiny balls of tempura batter. SO GOOD! Everything was excellent and I like that they do not douse the sushi with too much sauce, which lets you taste the freshness of the fish. Our only complaint is that they did not have sugar for my daughters tea, of which she sadly can't do without, but the owner added vanilla coffee syrup, which was not bad at all."}
{"text":"Went there yesterday but found out that the restaurant has sold to another owner. I hope new owner can make it even better. They were closed yesterday and don't know when they will open again under new management."}
{"text":"Very friendly people. But their fish quality isn't that great. I got the rainbow roll and the red dragon roll. Their raw fish quality is the same quality as what you would get at a chinese buffet. It's not that great quality. Their rolls are well-made though, and taste just okay. It's still very edible and tastes decent enough to eat. The prices are similar to other sushi restaurants I've been too, if not a couple dollars cheaper.

They don't have uni (sea urchin), and I don't think the owners are Japanese (they didn't know what Uni was). 

Would I go here again? Maybe if I'm around the area and I'm really hungry. HOWEVER, I won't travel 20 minutes again JUST to eat there."}
{"text":"This place is proof you do not have to spend a ridiculous amount of food for absolutely delicious food. Service was wonderful. I got the shrimp tempura bento box and every bit was yummy- for only $10 you get a side salad, meso soup, 4 pieces of california rolls, 5 decent size pieces of shrimp tempura, and a large amount of steamed rice. It was the perfect amount of everything. We also were able to try their sweet iced tea, which I recommend to everyone! I can not wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Excellent service, casual atmosphere. Coffee was a little weak, but the sushi tasted very fresh and was prepared nicely. Try the red figi roll, it's a new favorite of ours. Delicious rolls and very reasonable prices. I will definitely be back!
Sorry about the picture, we ate it too fast so half is missing in the photo. It was a beautiful presentation before we devoured it."}
{"text":"Some of the best sushi I have had in the area! Their lattes are no joke either! Will come back every time I am in town!"}
{"text":"Fresh, full of flavor.  The service was very good!  The cucumber salad they brought out before the sushi was really delicious.  Clean."}
{"text":"I'm a little nervous about eating here. I ordered 3 bento lunch specials & all were served to us less than 5 mins after ordering. Ummmm that didn't seem right to me. The costumer service was good though. I hate to say it but the Chicken and beef teriyaki tasted super fake!! Not even joking. The sushi was decent, the cups weren't washed good. I'm scared I might of ate something else beside chicken and beef :/ I'm preparing myself for some type of food poisoning."}
{"text":"Great quality sushi at a very affordable price. Went here for lunch and got the spicy salmon and spicy tuna rolls. Fish was good quality and the rolls were well made and tasty. Staff was extremely friendly and helpful. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Very good rolls.  Staff is very friendly.   If you are not sure about trying sushi this is a great place to start.  Unfortunately no sushimi.  Also had the green salad. Delicious dressing.  Very clean."}
{"text":"My friend and I visited this Sushi joint yesterday at 6:10pm (we had no idea they closed at 7 - seems kind of early even for a week day!). 

When we walked in we didn't really know if we should seat ourselves or wait, so we asked and the sushi chef told us to sit anywhere.

A few moments later a friendly gentleman came over and served us some cold cucumber salad (delicious!) to cleanse our palette. He was obviously a smoker and didn't wash his hands very well (or at all), because the smell of cigarette smoke was almost unbearable. Each time he came over to point something out on the menu, fill our water, or serve something, the smell of cigarettes lingered. It was awful and completely ruined the ambiance for me and my friend. Let it be known that our server was very kind, informative and willing to go the extra mile. He just didn't smell good.

We ordered a couple of rolls and two of their bowls - spicy chicken and shrimp tempura. My spicy chicken bowl was pretty good, but my friend noted that her shrimp was soggy. The Crunchy Crab roll was very good, as was the Shrimp Tempura roll. 

The food came out slowly and one item at a time; my friend had to sit there and watch me eat while she waited for her food.  It was frustrating since we were the only customers there.

The prices aren't bad at all compared to other sushi restaurants.

I'd be willing to try this place again, but I'd probably take my food to go."}
{"text":"Best sushi on the west side of town! I have been here several times now and have never been disappointed. The staff is friendly and the fish always taste fresh. 

A prior comment notes they are closed randomly but I haven't experienced this. I'm not one for planning and sometimes when you are in the mood for sushi you just have to get up and go. Never seen this place closed outside of its posted hours.

Fully recommend the place if you are near the Westgate area. Little hard to find but its right next to Big Fat Greek which is towards the entrance off of Glendale Ave.

Enjoy!"}
