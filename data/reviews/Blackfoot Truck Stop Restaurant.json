{"text":"|f you want the real truck stop diner experience I highly recommend the Blackfoot diner.  The food is good and pretty cheap (a grilled cheese for 3.80?!) and the coffee is decent.  It's a good place to while away a few hours.  You could sit there all night and the pink waitresses will never chase you out; they'll just keep filling up your coffee and calling you 'dear'.   I love this old place."}
{"text":"We love this place so much. Everything tastes like it was home cooked with family recipes. It's just all comfort food. INSANELY affordable for a good steak too! It's an awesome alternative to a late night Denny's trip. 
You can tell that the servers are a bit overwhelmed when it gets really busy, but they're all absolutely lovely. I can see how some mistakes would be made as seen in the other reviews, but they're all quick to resolve any issues. Jewel is especially wonderful and makes us feel at home. Treat the servers like family and they'll make sure you're right cozy."}
{"text":"We love this place!  Food is pretty darn good. .THE BEST THICK MILKSHAKES just like they used to be in the 50's served in the metal shake mix holders!  Love my chocolate!  And filling!  They're hamburger steak is kitchen made with fried onions mashed potatoes I'd that's your choice and lots of dark gravy yum. . Their soups  are pretty good. .i like the homemade tomato and macaroni. .and there sides of bread are delicious warm and homemade tasting,  great for dunking!  They have daily specials and menus that still have jello matrimonial squares (dates and oats) angel food cake and pies. .very casual homey atmosphere with cool retro route 66 upholstery on the bench booths. .a juke box and some tables still have the original litte jukeboxes at them.  Some have credit card phones as this is a truck stop. . Its clean well loved and carries on the late owners traditions.  May that lovely lady rest in peace.  She would turn no person away in her days.  Its open 24 hours and the serving staff are fast efficient and friendly and may call you Dear. .:) There is a charming train that runs on a track overhead around the whole restaurant. .great for young and old kids lol loads of parking!"}
{"text":"I love the nostalgia of this authentic old school diner. You can sense the history here from the well worn table tops to the train that scoots through the restaurant well above your head and the friendly service you get it feels like going home. 

Come in and seat yourself and you will see a broad range of people and personalities enjoying their food (24 hours a day). Somehow I suspect the food would taste way better at 2am ;-) 

And this is where they lose a star. From what we have ordered in the past... mostly burgers, chicken fingers and sandwiches their food is mostly pre- bought (makes me think of GFS~ please correct me if I am mistaken). 

My Hubs is excited to go back and try something that must be homemade off the menu and I will be happy to join him!"}
{"text":"This hands down has got to be one of the worse breakfast places I've been to. In terms of the food- rubbery eggs, cold over processed sausage and raw potatoes- the small single slice of rye bread was ok but.. small. Waitress was outwardly annoyed that I was taking a table instead of sitting at the bar (even though there were about 20 tables free)- she comment after I made my order. On the bright side: it's a cool looking classic diner, with a model train that rolls around the room.. if I was here for the train and classic feel it would've gotten 4 stars easy... unfortunately, I came here to eat."}
{"text":"Seriously did not understand the hype of this place. It was disgusting. Our cups weren't even cleaned, took forever to order food (and they charged us for something that we never even ended up getting). And to top it off, hair in our fries. I had the worst stomach ache after leaving that place. I gag every time I think of that experience I had and I will never go back. It would be in your best interest of you avoided this place all together."}
{"text":"Tonight was first time at Blackfoot Truck Stop diner. I felt like I went back in time like Marty McFly in Back to the Future. Very nostalgic atmosphere and what better way to enjoy the moment than to listen to some old tunes jukebox style with a few friends Wanda and Waldo. You start off with the waitress opening with glistening smile and a soothing voice to take your order. Next up, an order of the best hot chocolate topped off with whipped cream. Perfect for a winter night. The old fashioned chilly with corn bread just hit the spot. It's an oldie but a goodie and I highly recommend it. If you don't know what to order, order the chilly with corn bread cuz you won't go wrong. To top off the night, a slice of heaven in form of Saskatoon strawberry pie with vanilla ice cream. Just the look of the pie seduces you to take on each bite passionately. At the end of the night you'll be left feeling satisfied with the experience. Better you know what ;-)"}
{"text":"This is one of those old-time places you didn't think existed anymore. Walking through the door takes you into this strange 50s inspired world of pink walls, tacky artwork (portraits of trucks and James Dean with LED lights in them), a jukebox full of depressing country music and a few lonely souls sucking back coffee with grim looks on their faces. There was a cowboy mopping the floor, laughing through his mustache and there was a toy train circling high above the diner. It is all pleasantly bizarre.
The food was great. Just as you'd expect it to be. We had breakfast around midnight and it was delicious. Great eggs, real strips of bacon and sausage, good toast and you can even get a beer to go with it. The waitress was wearing pink hospital scrubs which she said they made her wear, but the service was excellent. She was quick and attentive.
The only thing annoying about the place was the guy who was sitting and staring into the distance with his cup of coffee. When he heard us talking about the jukebox, he jumped up and fed it enough change to keep his depressing new country tunes going all night. It was terrible. He was obviously distraught about something and I suppose a few bucks on the jukebox saves a few hundred in psych bills and medication, so we let him have his shit songs.
Anyway, if you're looking for real, truck stop/diner food, Blackfoot Restaurant is the best in town, complete with the ambiance that goes with it."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of this place! Not something I usually go into, but I've gone here many times while I'm in the area. Nicest staff ever! And such a great value for your food!"}
{"text":"I used to go here at least 2 times week. The coffee was good and the portions were overly generous. The burgrers here great and my fav was the chicken salad sandwich which was overflowing over with huge chunks of fresh chicken. I was in here again for the first time in 2 years. Ordered the chicken again and was sadsly disappointed the amount of chicken was a small schmear of it on thin bread that fell apart. I used to not be able to finish it before. This time i wanted to stop on the way home and get a snack. Bitterly disappointed."}
{"text":"If you looking for a classic truck stop food place. Eggs, flapjacks, bacon steak etc. This will hit the spot. Affordable prices. Nothing flashy but tasty and filling."}
{"text":"If you wake up with a hankering for greasy eggs and bacon, fat, fluffy pancakes, thin coffee you can drink for hours, and nostalgia pieces that still think they're contemporary because they're wholly functional , then this is the place for you.

Nothing fancy but absolutely honest and filling.  

You are treated as a customer, hungry from the road and in need of sustenance, post-haste.  The people are friendly but don't suck up.  They know what you want and give you the opportunity to get it.

You blend in because you're made to feel unexceptional.  It's a liberating eating experience.  There is no special parley required here; order and eat.

For parents, the diner has a miniature train that runs around the upper-reaches of the diner.  My boy loved it.

The bathrooms are clean too, for what it's worth."}
{"text":"The chili with cornbread was excellent. The pumpkin pie was the worst I have ever eaten. The pie filling was tasteless.  Service was excellent."}
{"text":"Love this diner. Brings back memories of long gone truck stops where the food was home cooked, the waitresses were like your mom or grandma, and the portions were filling.. all at a reasonable price. Have a had a couple of misses on the quality of the meals over the years, but for the most part it is good food. They actually use real food such as real potatoes instead of the instant potato mix and the meat is of good quality. My favorites are the hot turkey and the hot beef sandwich meals. Of course you have to try their flapper pie at least once - again a favorite choice of mine. It looks large, but the meringue melts in your mouth, the custard is light and there is very little crust. They do take out and took some to my finicky elderly mom, who normally eats very little and she cleared the whole plate!"}
{"text":"Is this place for real?? OMG this is a blast from the past. I felt like a kid again! I was waiting for the waitress to tell me to kiss her grits when I asked for more water!!

Pink , bubblegum walls, 80's updated decor! Counter with stools! Table tops faded from years of hard wiping. You can't recreate this stuff!

Food is just old school diner, good, hearty stick to your ribs food! The pie...good gawd its like a 6 inch high lemon meringue pie. Please share with friends and family, its HUGE. 

This was my first time here and I will be going back with friends for Mom's cooking :)"}
{"text":"Conviniently open for 24/7, great place to hang out around the clock, no worries about parking  lot, very fast service and super cheap..
the food we ordered was good, so much menus to choose from you can have breakfast all day , definetley will come back"}
{"text":"What a diner is supposed to be:
Not fancy!
Down to earth folk 
Friendly staff 
Great coffee
Great portion sizes
Good breakfasts
The right price"}
{"text":"Maybe we caught them on a bad day, but this was the worst service I've experienced in a very long time. 

The first clue should have been when she only took 2 of 3 orders and started to leave the table. We were a little shocked but figured she was tired or had a flake moment and brushed it off. Should have known better! We saw her only twice more - once to get our food and once to get the check. That's it. Couldn't even get a refill because she totally left the floor. She didn't ask if we wanted anything else before the check. Just dropped it and walked away. The \"funny\" part was I could hear her in the back trash talking a co-worker for being a bad waitress. 

When we tried to pay, the whole wait staff completely ignored us for several mins. They kept looking at us (I made eye contact) then pretended to be busy. It's possible they only have certain people handle the cash but they didn't make any effort to get that person either. It took so long I feel like there should be a rule like 10 mins or more waiting to pay and your meal is free. 

Doubt I'll ever go back. It's a pity because this place used to be great!"}
{"text":"This place just feels right.  I had never been there but felt like I had been 100 times.  The decor is great, and totally small town.  The juke bodes on the tables are amazing and the train running around the top blew my mind.  The pies are delicious.  No frills or gimmicks. Just good ol fashioned fun."}
{"text":"Always consistent. I have taken some of important (or at least self important) visitors to the Blackfoot for breakfast and am always thrilled to see their faces when we pull up and then see their smiles when we have eaten. I only go for breakfast and really like the pancakes. Take some time and soak up the 70's."}
{"text":"This is a great place to get some fuel. No fine dinning by any means but good food none of the less. Be prepared to a flash back to the 1970 when you walk in, which in a way makes this place trendy.  Food is reasonably priced and service good. It is a great stop on your way in or out of town to grab a quick bite without spending too much."}
{"text":"Yo! it's the real deal son.

1. Decor - Authentic 1970s; jukebox filled with hank williams and the likes
2. Service- So good you wanna call her flo
3.Portions- enough to stuff a donkey


Food was not mind  blowing but guess what...youre at a truck stop, shut up and enjoy."}
{"text":"If you are craving nostalgia and reasonably priced diner food, this is the perfect greasy spoon. The service is friendly. The ambience is authentic. The food is reliable and comfortable. If you want a real diner shake, jello or a giant piece of pie then you are in luck! It is a great place to bring family. It is nice to have a 24 hour go-to handy and a safe bet for a simple breakfast, I frequented here with my daughter when she was young; she loved the pink colour scheme and the train above that runs through the restaurant. There are juke boxes at some of the tables - fun to browse and choose songs.. Thank-you Blackfoot Diner, never change!"}
{"text":"On to other 'firsts' experienced this weekend.

After our golf game, the 4 of us (actually, allow me to clarify - the boys) decided to head over to the Blackfoot Truck Stop for breakfast. Since the ratio was 3 boys who wanted to eat at the truck stop vs. me, I bit my tongue and went along with it.

When we first pulled up, I looked over at my friends and said \"WHERE have you brought me?\"  At first glance, it's exactly that - a truck stop. Massive trucks parked everywhere, a lube shop across the street and mammoth-sized parking lot. But then you get inside and it's *awesome*.

Talk about a scene out of a movie! You walk through the doorway and it's as though you've travelled back in time. it's just like one of those breakfast places you'd see on the big screen. Bikers/Truckers and all types of people crowded at various booths, perky waitresses, pink walls, a toy train that rotates along the ceiling, TVs so you can watch while you eat and cheap, cheap food!

They serve pretty standard breakfast fare - omelettes, pancakes, etc. etc. I gotta be honest - I wasn't crazy about the food. It was what you would expect however, and it was super cheap. Each of us paid around $10 for breakfast and drinks and we all had an obscene amount of food left on our plates after all was said and done.

I'm told this place has been around for DECADES. We actually met the owner and she was such a sweet woman! She personally thanked us for coming and rather than being the type of owner that just sits back and manages, she was actually the one working the register!

Overall, a very interesting place. LOTS of character, LOTS of ambiance and LOTS of food. This definitely isn't the type of place you visit for the food, it's the type of place you visit for the experience!"}
{"text":"Food was great. My husband and I ordered the hot open faced turkey sandwich. The mashed potatoes and gravy were real and homemade! The soup that came with it was also homemade and delish. Huge portion and it came with desert. Unfortunately we were too full to taste the desert. Giving only 3 stars because the service was meh. Didn't get a refill on water or coffee."}
{"text":"I was roaming around Calgary for about 3 weeks on a musical tour in June/July. Naturally, i would start find my way out into the streets looking for wifi, coffee, a good diner and other cool local places to hang on my off times.  This was one of the last spots in Inglewood me and the the guys went to together near the end of our trip.  I had a forgetful waitress but the food was great.  I'm easy in diners; Breakfast food, hot coffee, some wheat toast.  Staff was friendly enough like everyone else i met in Canada.  I think i took a coffee to go.  Oh, and it's right off the number 1 bus that takes you all the way into downtown Calgary.  Thanks for capping off the visit with a good ol' diner meal."}
{"text":"This is a terrific place with the sweetest staff I have ever come across! The club sandwiches are very yummy, the turkey is roasted in house, no yucky deli meat. Great breakfasts with good sized portions and low costs ( I usually get a sandwich to go for $5 to take to work and they always load them up with lots of turkey, white or dark meat whatever you like) Orange cream milkshake is the best I've ever had and they keep a little tray of banana bread ( buttered of course) wrapped up at the front where you pay for only $1. A great little treat for after a meal. LOVE!"}
{"text":"The Blackfoot Truck Stop is exactly that, a 24 hour quirky diner that serves breakfasts with real bacon, lunches with fries and gravy, has daily specials and hasn't changed its decor since the 80's. If your looking for something fancy keep driving to Inglewood to be with the hipster crowd. If you want some tasty meals that don't skimp on flavour or portion size and the price is reasonable you'll be happy here.
We came at a busy time with few table options. We squeezed five of us into a booth for 4 and waited for a long time to be moved. The servers are quite busy and don't seem to do their own table maintenance. We kept busy by watching the toy train loop overhead and checked out the songs on the nearby jukebox. 3/$1.00
We ordered 4 types of pie and they all came out generously slathered with whipped cream. 
The lunch sandwiches (barbecue beef and clubhouse) were delicious and came out speedy quick with fries & a gravy option that I would definitely recommend. The side macaroni salad was also very good.
The servers are quite overworked and hustle the food are generous with coffee refills but not as equally generous with water or pop. The bill was accurate and paid up at the entrance/exit. 
After the meal, I checked out the restrooms. They definitely need a bleaching and an update. I chose just to be very selective about what I touched.
I would definitely rank this up there with Denny's. If you are in the mood for an all day breakfast, milkshake, fries and some pie, c'mon down!"}
{"text":"This is as authentic a truck stop diner as you are going to find - large portions, a not-to-exotic extensive menu, worn out formica countertops, reasonable prices, salt of the earth waitresses and a really varied clientele. I am sure at one time this diner was located on the wrong side of the tracks literally and figuratively, but with gentrification as it is, it is now not so bad. 

I have been here twice for dinner and ordered breakfast both times. Some of their dinner entrees look a little scary - mystery brown meat smothered in mystery brown gravy, but you can't usually go wrong with breakfast stuff. They have really good pancakes (but lousy syrup) and outstanding omelettes and hash browns. I had the chicken salsa omelette and couldn't believe how much chicken it was filled with. 

Despite our full bellies we had to try a slice of their pies. Both the lemon meringue and the banana cream are delicious and are fairly inexpensive.  

Not a bad place for a back-to-basics type meal."}
{"text":"My rating has slipped a couple of notches.  We've eaten there for 30 years or more.  I see some of the very same waitresses they had when we started going there.  The daytime ones are cranky and rude these days, but some of the evening staff are friendlier.  It doesn't matter who serves you, they will slam the cutlery in a pile on the table, spill the coffee on the table when they  fill your cup, march off with only half of your order while you are still speaking to them.   Argh!  Once the owner passed away, I think it slipped another notch.  I think they should fire all of them and hire new fresh faces -  young smiling ones, not grouchy frowning ones.  They re-painted a couple of years ago - an untasteful gory pink.  However, they still have the same menu items, some of which still taste OK.  Prices have gone up.  I remember coffee being much lower and some people used to hang around for refills for a couple of hours.  They'll stop giving you refills  if you hang around that long while they're busy, though.  I'm sorry to see it slip in the star ratings, but its the truth."}
{"text":"Located right off 17ave, the Blackfoot Truck Stop was an A+ alternative to any chain diner. 

Their burgers and shakes are great, but in my last visit I discovered how amazing their baked beans and bacon are. It's sweet with a touch of salty complimented with huge chunks of bacon! The menu price always guarantees a huge meal under $20

The service has always been great considering my previous interactions with servers at other late night diner locations was like interacting with a reanimated corpse. Bite me they will not!

The restaurant decor is subtle but densely interesting. Theres a train set that quietly circles the dining room, but spends most of it's time in suspended animation. I like the George Burns movie poster right by the washroom. It seems like even after 100 visits, there is always something new to see inside this place. However, the parking lot is chaotic, cars are lined up like toppled toy blocks. I almost nailed some strange low cement post whose purpose still eludes me."}
{"text":"The quintessential truck stop, Blackfoot Truck Stop is everything you'd expect it to be - fast, affordable, and quaint, with portions to fill even the hungriest person up. 

If you follow my reviews, I've been trying more and more breakfast places out when I have the chance. There's something about having a great breakfast that can totally make your day, and Blackfoot manages to do just that. 

The diner is a bit out of the way if you're not driving, but it has a massive  parking lot if you can't walk or bus it - that's great, because it can get very full on weekends. I've been here a few times now, and the experience maintains consistency: a warm, inviting atmosphere with a lot of quirky/gaudy decoration, servers wearing scrubs that dash around with coffee refills, and no presumption about its patrons. You can walk in, grab a seat, and pick up the menu on the table, and you know your server will be there  right away to ask you about your drinks. She'll probably call you honey or sweetie too- if you're me, it makes you smile and reminds you of some sort of childhood experience. 

I've tried a few things on the menu, and generally, I can say this: if you're eating clean or healthy, this isn't your place. There's likely to be grease or butter, or both in everything you try here...but sometimes that's just what you need. The specials (and really, everything on the menu) are pretty affordable, and they pile up your plate with food. You shouldn't leave hungry, and there's always a big  dessert menu in case you need to put that sweet tooth to rest. Memorable breakfasts for me include the Working Man's Breakfast, which is a traditional eggs, bacon, and sausage breakfast with pancakes for man or woman who's got the appetite for it. On the non-breakfast  side, one of my favourites is the patty melt, which is comfort food heaven...just try to ignore the calories. 

The staff has always been fantastically friendly, and they're always willing to try to put the smile on someone's face, especially if they're new.  If it's not running, ask the staff to turn the train on - it runs around the restaurant along a suspended track and it's very cute and unique. If you've got kids (or kids at heart!), there's the bells that always need the dust rung out...just be aware that they can be pretty loud if you're not quite awake yet!

Overall, a great (big) little  diner, and an out-of-the-way staple of Calgary's breakfast scene. Go check it out if you haven't - you won't regret it."}
{"text":"The Blackfoot Truck Stop is a Calgarian icon. If you're looking for fine dining, this isn't the place for you; but if you're in or around trendy Inglewood late at night--or early in the morning, or anywhere in between--and you're looking for warm, friendly service, a more-than-decent cup of coffee, and the most impressive slice of Flapper Pie you've ever seen, then this is the place for you.
Open 24 hours--for obvious reasons--I often find myself at the Blackfoot Truck Stop to while away happy late-night hours with friends. Whether it's injecting coffee into a friend  to prepare them for a 2am drive, or just to feed a hankering for warm apple pie with a slice of cheddar--or, in my case, a late night/early morning bowl of cream of wheat--I've always found the Blackfoot Truck Stop Restaurant inviting.
It's not swanky; but the home style food is delicious, the portions are generous, the prices are reasonable, and there's a model train running along the perimeter of the ceiling. Fun, and tasty, for all ages."}
{"text":"4 stars for after 12am dining, 2.5-3 if it is before 11:30pm. This place is a Calgary classic. There are not many places you can eat something at 3am and it taste great. This is one of them. The decor is cool and the truck stop crowd fun; it is the best place to get that third dinner after a night/morning of drinking! The desserts are simple but fresh and amazing; not too sweet but how a pie/cake should taste.

Recommend the grill cheese and fries on white with a side of pickle's then to finish a piece of apple pie with cheddar cheese on top!  

10-4 trucker buddy!"}
{"text":"It's truck stop food. But decent.  Their clubhouse is good, ordered with fries, ask for them extra crispy, they can be a bit soggy sometimes.  Cheeseburger is good, but their produce can be a bit stale.  Good old fashioned service and an icon in Inglewood.  Never dissapoints for me, but I know that it's just a truck stop."}
{"text":"oh!!! so huge parking space!!!! but almost all slots look full. :P ... 
The restaurant inside it looks like a old model classic. 
The tables are like too old and has the elbow marks over it.. and also you could engrave your name on it to see it when you visit after 20 years :P ( just kidding)..
The prices were reasonable but the food was pretty awesome... and the quantity was ample too... 
Not to forget , they charge per person 5$ during lunch and supper hours.. :) ...
Service was a quick too.. But the waitress are not at all friendly.. 
Even one of my friend complemented the food and there was no response from the waitress :P
Overall:
Not a bad place to visit though,.."}
{"text":"Looking for a delicious breakfast in a laid back environment with a side of people watching? Prefer an atmosphere where you're either a hun or a dear? Bottomless cups of coffee and a breakfast dish that includes pork chops? 
Then The Blackfoot Truck Stop is perfect for you with prices to match and the decor is just busy enough that every visit is sure to reveal a new gem."}
{"text":"I was hung over, tired and blurry eyed and this place was like a haven in the distance. I will say that they lack a true \"big breakfast\" but you can order one of the larger ones and add more of the breakfast meats to it to get the same thing. They have a great selection of toasts and the eggs were cooked beautifully.

The bacon is a bit on the soft side which I am sure I coulf have asked for it to be fried a bit more and the potatoes are a bit soft not crispy as I have had in the past with most home fries. I would still go here again as it is a fantastic hang over breakfast."}
{"text":"Terrible service! I sat down (sign read seat yourself). I took a phone call as I sat down so I know I'm not being dramatic when I say I waited 10 minutes with no sign of a server. I went to the counter and asked if I should order there since I saw people going up to pay.. The server at the till snappily told me my server would be around soon. (I am a server myself, and I understand that sometimes you get busy and can't get to a table.. but this restaurant was far from full) So I sat back down.. As I was waiting a gentleman sat down next table over.. I had been waiting 20 minutes at this time, when the same server that I had spoken to earlier goes to the gentleman and says \"I'll be with you in just a second\".. not even glancing at me.. knowing full well I had still not been served. Terrible service and will not be returning. It's a shame because this place is a 3 minute walk from work and I would definitely have been going there often."}
{"text":"A train that circles overhead.  A waitress that calls you 'dear' and 'sweetheart' in a darling UK accent (we all fell in love with Her, she is LEGIT).  

Flapper pie that is sky-high.  Great prices.  Free wi-fi.  An extensive menu.  A clientele that looks like a casting call for 'visually fascinating extras'.  SERIOUSLY, what is not to like?

We came for breakfast.  We will return for lunch and dinner.  The traditional breakfast was surprisingly ungreasy.  The corned beef hash was tasty and well seasoned.  Coffee refills aplenty and lots to look at.

If I had to offer one suggestion:  more seasoning on the potato 'hash browns'."}
{"text":"Take a step back in time and enjoy table side jute boxes, trains the circle around your head while you eat, down to the out fits on the servers.  
Love it! 
Best for a good old greasy breakfast and fluffy pancakes. Don't forget to have your flapper pie it's world famous!"}
{"text":"Heard so much about this place, but I'm afraid it was far from fabulous. We were served quick, but then forgot about. The eggs Benny were sub par. Not sure what the hollandaise sauce was made of, but it wasn't eggs! Sort of a white, tasteless gravy. The hash browns were mush in my mouth, and looked seriously unappetizing. 

The decor is so over-the-top tacky, but goes with the territory. Definitely get what you pay for; cheap, and pre-made/packaged. Might go back for a burger, but breakfast was blah!!"}
{"text":"There's nothing I love more than a good and decent diner; and this place nails it. Real people, Johnny Cash & Hank Williams Sr. on the jukebox and waitresses that care and tend to your needs with a smile and a \"hun\"; there's no pretention here; only good food, good ole country music and a train the rolls around and around, high above your head. It's the perfect way to start your day, to cure what may ail ya, or if you're a truck driver; to  grab a hot homestyle meal between stops.  Open 24 hours a day and a Calgary establishment for over 50 years, I swear the walls are wishing the could tell their stories because I'm sure they'd have plenty to share.

The Western Omellette is delicious and filling, their hashbrowns aren't deep fried; which makes them even better, and the bacon is cooked perfectly. Best part is everything is made fresh to order; the only bummer is the coffee. I found it weak and thin, but that's never going to stop me from going back again, and again and again and....."}
{"text":"Had the Hot Turkey Sandwich and the Beef Dip tonight - service was friendly and prompt, love the nostalgic feel of the place, and the food was deeeeeelish! I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"first point: this is a truck stop. I am giving it 5 \"truck stop\" stars here, different class of animal from say, a fine dining restaurant.

Keep this in mind, people who love this place are coming here for crinkle cut french fries and gravy, and a slice of home made flapper pie with 8 inches of meringue on top, not for eggs benedict or a perfectly done new york strip.

It has nostalgia for many people, it is a great greasy spoon kinda place, where the waitresses remember your name if you are a regular, and there are unlimited refills of black tar coffee. They don't mind if you hang out for 3 hours sipping free refills and chatting with friends.  Some may find the decor tacky, but i think it is fun and \"quirky.\" they are what they are here, and they're in no hurry to change it. And I am ok with that. 

I work near by, and have dropped in many times for lunch and have always enjoyed it. Also spend many many evenings long into the morning hanging out here with friends just enjoying coffee and a place to sit and chat.

This is a place that makes a greasy burger and greasy fires, and serves hot coffee and home made pie, all served up with a scoop of indifference, or even some restrained familiarity for the regulars. I like it. my kind of place."}
{"text":"Staff not attentive to their job - got a dirty spoon and bunch of redundant questions from our server. They don't even reply to emails."}
{"text":"I just love diners!

Kinda got lost in this area, at first a bit industrial simply b/c of this huge land that it's sitting on, with the old-style Petro Canada there, which not surprisingly, same owner who built the current location 35 years ago..no wonder it's an antique inside, and it should stay that way lol.

Even has an enclosed seating area on the left, complete with booths.

Your typical breakfast/burgers joint but when I saw the lemon meringue pie, I've had a craving for it and for $4, it was one of the best slices I've had...and not too sweet or sour (well, it's lemon after all).   Did inquire about their well-known \"flapper pie\" which is basically custard instead of the lemon part.  Nah, I'm a bit old-fashioned, why mess with a great concept ;)

Unbelievably, this place even takes amex!

Don't let the shop name fool ya, it's quite large, good 75 seats easy, with super friendly staff..dont' dig their hospital-grubs as a uniform, but you sure can't miss their pink ;)"}
{"text":"In the past I have loved the Blackfoot Truck Stop.... let me just say that, as a lover of all things PIE this is the place to go and get dependable service, coffee, pie and watch the train go around the ceiling.
This seems to have changed... I am hoping it was just a one-off bad experience.
We sat down, a group of 8 of us I believe, and we must have flustered the waitress somehow because from that point on it all went downhill.
One guy asked for a kokanee - she brought a coke, a chocolate milkshake - she brought chocolate milk, etc etc .
we placed our orders, mine for a slice of my trusty \"fresh baked\" strawberry rhubarb pie.
The orders arrived, extra soup (not ordered) breakfast orders wrong, additional pancakes, no hot sauce when asked for it, and worst of all (to me) a strange pie shaped item in front of my face.... it looked like plastic pie, and was rock hard, my fork could not break into its delicious pastry crust... i asked for it to be heated up... she took it away, it came back ice cold...
i asked again, again she took it to the microwave (i was hoping to attempt to melt the insides a little to make it a syrupy sweet fruit mixture to enjoy) it came back... like warmed plasticine.... not at all pie consistency..
in fact not edible at all.
SADNESS....."}
{"text":"Without the Blackfoot Diner there would be many nights where I would have gone home drunk, hungry and alone. Thank goodness they're 24hrs.

The menu is classic diner fare, burgers, fries, shakes, steaks, hot turkey sandwiches, all day breakfast and home made pies.

Always check for the specials too.

The waitresses are an always sweet bunch, decked out in pink scrubs and ready to take your order.

If the model train isn't running when you come in, if you ask nicely they might turn it on for you.

I've had many memorable meals here (though the circumstances that lead me to eating here at 3-4am shan't be mentioned) with friends and even family and everyone left happy.

Who, after all, doesn't appreciate good, honest food at fair prices?"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! My daughter loved the pink walls, kitschy art, and the train that runs around the restaurant. We only waited a few minutes for a table, and the friendly waitress greeted us quickly, and served our drinks and food with a smile in a timely manner. 
The food was terrific! We opted for lunch. My daughter had a chili dog with cheese that she gobbled right up. I tried the chili and it was very flavorful and there was tons on her huge hot dog and toasted bun.
My husband had the chili burger with fries and gravy. Another fantastic serving of chili on a flavorful patty and fresh bun. 
I had the patty melt - as I almost always do at a diner type restaurant - and this one was amazing. The patty was super flavorful and lean, the grilled onions were perfect, the while cheese was melty, and the rye bread tasted so fresh and was deliciously toasty.  
My only regret is that I didn't have room for pie and a milkshake. We are DEFINITELY going back soon.  
Our meal plus a coffee and soda was $42 - seems expensive, except we enjoyed every mouthful, we added extras like cheese and gravy to our meals, and none of us were hungry for dinner later, it was that filling and satisfying!"}
{"text":"I had a hard time deciding whether or not to give this review 3 or 4 stars...but ultimately, the service was so great and our experience here warranted 4 stars.

I've driven by this place many times, but it wasn't until I read the Yelp reviews that I was interested in trying it out. It was late, we were hungry, and we didn't want fast food, so I was able to convince Josh to take us here. There were a surprising lack of truckers, but a few tables full at 9:45PM on a Friday night, mostly of regular people like us. Not nearly as sketchy as I imagined. It was everything I expected it to be...right down to the Pepto Bismol pink walls and kitschy decor. It was neat to look around and see all the pictures and memorabilia - the place felt authentic and the menu had something for everyone.

What made our visit here was our waitress. She was amazing. Probably the nicest, coolest chick I've ever had for a server and she was great! I decided to play it safe and ordered Chicken Fingers and Fries, while Josh ordered the Trucker's Breakfast. We were entertained by the table beside us while waiting for our food, which came out quickly. The food was good, and both our tummies and our wallets were satisfied.

Upon paying the bill, we left our server a pretty decent tip as she was just so darn nice. She was genuinely taken aback by this and looked shocked. What was pocket change to us meant a lot to her and that made the whole experience worth it. I'll definitely be back to this charming little diner for a burger and a milkshake - it might just be my new favorite late-night joint!"}
{"text":"Worst hash browns I've ever had. People are deluded if they think the food is even remotely good. When I say hash browns I think, hashed/shredded and fried/browned potato's. Not 6 boiled potato's chopped into large chunks, unseasoned, white and soggy mess in a bowl that I was served. I went here for the charm but this place is operated like worst truck stop in America not a place you go for good food cheap. Seriously, shred and fry your hash browns no one likes boiled chunks of potato!"}
{"text":"It's taken me almost two weeks to decide what I thought of the Blackfoot Truck Stop. My first impression was a 2 star. I stopped in for lunch awhile back with a friend of mine and the place was packed at 130 in the afternoon with all kinds of folk, from randoms to suits, truly only the kind of variety a truck stop can attract. It took longer than it should've for a server to come clear the table we had chosen and even at that, we had to go looking for one of them.

Our food came out quickly, I had a reuben with some potato cheddar soup. The soup arrived first with some slices so squashed bread. Did they really bring that to my table?

So why the four-star? For uniqueness and authenticity. The servers wear pink scrubs and I swear the one serving us was easily 70 years old. She kept called me sweetie. The memorabilia on the walls keeps you entertained even if the people don't. And there's a model train that runs the loop of the restaurant near the ceiling. Many of the pictures on the walls are even lit up with tiny lights shining through them. Next time I'm heading in at 3 am. I bet it's a whole other diner then."}
{"text":"When I'm driving to the gym after work, I always drive by the sign \"Blackfoot Truck Stop\" and I've always wondered about this place.  One time after the gym, one of the guys asked if we wanted to go for brunch and suggested the truck stop - COOL!  So that's how I first heard about it, then I decided to take my brother here for brunch after the gym on Sunday.  Blackfoot Truck Stop is located on 9 Avenue SE, as you pull up, it looks kind of dodgy AF, big semi-trucks everywhere and a large parking lot then you look over and there's the cute little diner, hole in the wall.

My brother and I walked in and one of the first things he noticed was the neat train that is moving on the tracks.  I looked around and thought this was a cute Ma and Pa joint where older people come and catch up and sip on coffee., kind of has this 'cheers' vibe.  There were two small groups ahead of us but they were seated right away. We were seated near the dessert display in a comfy booth.  The menu is already on the table as well as napkins, jams, syrup, milk/sugar for coffee and they also have a daily special posted on the boards.  Our server came by and said hi and poured us two waters.  We browsed the menu - breakfast, lunch and dinner is served as well as desserts and their famous flapper pie.  We were both craving some breakfast eats so we both ordered the 'working man's breakfast' which consists of a pancake, 3 sausages, 2 eggs, some potatoes and a side of toast. I like this because I can get my little sweet fix which is the pancake!  We both ordered poached eggs so they came on the side - they were overdone but to be honest, I didn't have high expectations. The pancake was nice and fluffy, the sausages were good, potatoes were nice and soft and the toast was warm but nothing was out of this world.

The service was great, waters were filled and the plates were being taken away when we were done.  Our waitress came by a few times to ensure things were good and she was smiling from ear to ear and super sweet.

My all-time favorite part of my whole experience at the Blackfoot Truck stop?  CANDY AT THE FRONT! 3 candies for 10 cents!! I grab a paper bag and fill the candies - I mean the candy is nothing different from any other 5 cent candy but its THREE for 10 cents! What a steal!!! Haha, if only you knew how much I love '5' cent candies and I got super excited since they jacked up the price at 7-11s ;)

Overall, the Blackfoot Truck Stop is a place you visit when you know you can cook your own food at home but you're really too lazy to do so or it's a place you want to get a fast, inexpensive bite to eat.  I'd say definitely come here for the experience, it's never overly busy and everyone is sweet.  Next time, I will try their famous flapper pie because it looks huge and delicious."}
{"text":"A solid and most of all honest place! No frills, no special treatment,no fancy this or that! They have a choo choo train riding up on the rafters and worn out tables on which thousands and thousands of elbows have rested. This place has a soul.

The food is much like the atmosphere, simple, hearty goodness. It's mildly seasoned (which would be a crime in certain restaurants) but here it's part of the shtick, a lot of older people come here and they prefer to season their own food, it's a common practice of classic eating holes. Being sensitive to those who \"don't like too much salt\" or \"don't like it spicy\" also to those who have health conditions that need to monitor what they eat. One other great feature, this place is cheap and has very fair pricing for everything on the menu!

It's open 24 hours and is a great late night destination ( much better than Denny's). The servers have lots of personality and are a pleasure to chat with. In my opinion, it's one of those few places that all ages, all walks of life are truly welcome and all treated with the same care. No niche crowds here, (well maybe truckers are a niche crowd!) But it really does have a homely feel about it and its one of the few restaurants where outdated and worn out decor actually enhance the experience. It is what it is ! A true Calgary classic! Nothing more, nothing less! Check it out!

{"text":"Do you want to know why I appreciate Blackfoot Truck Stop? Because, it feels like home."}
{"text":"I'm surprised that the Blackfoot Diner is even on Yelp! Despite the tacky factor, this is one of my favourite places in the city. 

I started going here probably 8 years ago as one of the few 24 hour coffee places in the city. I've spent MANY a night with an endless cup of coffee, listening to old country tunes from the jukebox and consuming a steady stream of comfort food. The decor is tacky-old-diner-chic, complete with an overdose of pink and a wall art with backlit 1950's movie stars. Look for the Furby in the train. You'll know what I mean if you've been there. 

The part that most of you won't know is that I know this place as \"Edna's\". Edna is the original owner - a feisty old woman who knows how to run her business. She's often in there, checking in on things. You have to respect the woman for continuing to run her business well into her eighties.

Fave elements:
-really cheap prices
-24 hour kitchen & bottomless (decent) coffee
-great service

Fave foods:
-beef dip
- anything with gravy (best gravy in town)
-greasy perogies
-wide assortment of pies (love the Banana or Coconut Creme)

This isn't someplace fancy, but if you're looking to go somewhere to chill out without judgement or if you're low on pennies, stop on in. A great choice for those of you working evening shifts (been there). 

See you at Edna's!"}
{"text":"Wow, this place is overrated by most reviewers, if you ask me.  I've been to many truck stop restaurants in my time because as a kid and tween, I traveled with my truck driving dad in Canada and the U.S.  I also had a client that worked in one so I visited him on site.  This place is brutal and I actually was taken aback when I walked in for the first time today.  

The decor is tacky.  Not in a cool and classic way, but in an \"I'm too lazy to renovate and won't lose business if I don't\" kind of way.  I do not recall any truck stop joint that I've ever sat in to look this gaudy or smell like body odor.  Maybe it was a patron and not the cushions, but that was my first whiff in the door and it also put me off.  

The servers are very friendly but due to lack of communication, no one approached our table for ten minutes and that's because we didn't wave someone down earlier. 

Our food arrived quickly, but the chunky potato hash browns were not browned at all and very blah.  I had the cheddar cheese omelet and somehow it also was blah.  The only thing I truly enjoyed was my buttery toast.  I asked for tea and wasn't given a choice.

The only factors that nearly warrant Blackfoot Truck Stop two stars is the pleasant staff and the foamy soap.  I was asked to meet here and will never return if I have my way."}
{"text":"The real deal in truck stop gastronomics! Minimal use of salt, good coffee, simple burgers and thick milkshakes. If the food doesn't impress you, then sit and stare at the seizure inducing decor: flashing lights, trying-too-hard-to-fail 50's diner ambience, and authentic jukes blasting country tunes. Damn good pie, too."}
{"text":"The Blackfoot Truck Stop is a classic anachronism near the heart of the city.  Looking much like someone put a time vortex to freeze the place in the 70s would only begin to describe how this place is like.  With the  classic old diner seats, pictures and tacky yet familiar wall paper, and the unusual train set that runs all above the diners, it specializes in classic diner home cooked foods such as burgers, hearty breakfasts and home standards like meat loaf and so on.  The staff there seems to also be there from the 70s, and many have been.

The service is quite charming, much like what most people would imagine as Americana diner life, with the waitress who's seen it all, but would still give you a wink and a knowing smile to greet you as you come in.  As also from such seasoned staff, service was quick as well as the food, yet never over or underdone.

As for the food itself, as I said, it's comprised of food classics, but in American style abundance.  In other words, expect to be well fed.  I've tried the burgers and a number of the breakfasts, and never have been disappointed as of yet."}
{"text":"Basically one of the cutest places to go for breakfast. It's relaxed, welcoming, and fun (there is a train that circles the room). 
I LOVE the pancakes and the bacon is greasy and tasty; just like you would expect from a truck stop!  This place is casual enough for a quick meal with your partner, but I wouldn't have a first date here, haha."}
{"text":"Have been meaning to try this place for quite sometime. I know it has quite the cult following here, however I quickly discovered that I will not be a part of that following lol. 
 Definately an experience atmosphere wise. I felt like I was back in the 80's. Service was ok, food was ok at best. If you like processed cheese then you may like the omelettes. Overall I prefer the Deerhead Cafe for a cheap eats/dingy diner vibe. Much better tasting."}
{"text":"I've been eating at the Blackfoot truck stop since I was a little kid and its still good, its very sad that the previous owner Edna passed away due to heart problem (may her soul rest in peace) but its still so yummy besides the fact! The food here reminds me of my Grandmothers good old home cooked meals. It's also cute how they have a train that goes around the stop of the diner. Very laid back, happy and calm atmosphere. :)"}
{"text":"I've been eating here for over ten years and my heart still sings every time I walk through the doors. The ambiance has never changed. The best greasy spoon diner in Calgary for sure. People watching is INCREDIBLE here. Just go."}
{"text":"I really love this place. It's like being in another era. While reviewers have mentioned that the food isn't of amazing quality, well - it is a truck stop, but it's always tasty and cheap, and the service is extremely friendly and quick. Overall an adorable place - it's always busy for a reason. And the train overhead is just the best."}
{"text":"I don't know why I've only started going here recently. Love the funky decor, toy train, good prices and decent food. The dinner specials are the best bang for your buck (meat, veggies, soup, drink and dessert!)"}
{"text":"It's so busy  make sure to order everything at once because all 3 times we've been here we don't receive refills or service after we order until the bill --

I love truckstops, not only for their homemade food but for the curteous waitresses.

I think they are understaffed or just trying to cut corners. Not only did our waitress not offer a refill on our coffee, but she was physically not able to. I am also a waitress and would have crawled into a hole to hide if I had been given the huge section I could see her walking around. WOW For being 50ish she was on fire! 

Also, I like when my food is made especially for me - im the paying customer after all. I feel like the cook is so bogged down because they cut corners in the kitchen as well. Like with the mayo and ketchup on the side instead of on the burger because they cant be bothered. Or the salad dressing on the side rather then mixed throughout the salad. Cheap cheap cheap HIRE MORE PEOPLE! 

Weve been here a few times and will not be going back on our own."}
{"text":"Holy cow! YAH....got a t-bone steak for $15.... include soup and ice cream for dessert it's today's special it's not called t-bone steak though...Porter house steak....omg...so good of course didn't finish it....
If you read my review today...go to Blackfoot truck stop. ..."}
