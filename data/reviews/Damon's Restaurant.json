{"text":"When I lived in the area, we used to pull our weekly Damon's Triva Night out to play trivia, eat, drink, and have fun.

The staff was always friendly and the food was very tasty."}
{"text":"A pretty good regional chain restaurant where you can eat ribz, wingz, etc.  Don't get too excited."}
{"text":"I currently work at this Damon's and not that I'm a bias or anything but we have great food ranging from St. Louis and Baby Back Ribs to our Prime Rib and excellent steak selections.  I've worked here for two years and still enjoy our food and relaxed atmosphere.  Come join us for all sporting events in our Club House with 4 projection screens or bring in the whole family and celebrate your next party in our seperate dining room area.  Currently we have weeknight menu and drink specials ranging from All-You-Can-Eat Ribs on Tuesdays to our $9.99 8oz. Prime Rib Special on Thursdays. We are currently going through a menu transition in the next few weeks and will have some great new selections.  Come check us out for a fun time and great eats!!"}
