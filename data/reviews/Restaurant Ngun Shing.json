{"text":"J'aime ce petit resto douteux sur le Boul. Pie-Ix . La nourriture est bonne et les serveurs sont toujours en train de vous surveiller pour ne rien manquer. Ils ont un vaste menu et le midi c'est très très cheap! Typique resto chinois avec des nappes blanches en plastique haha!"}
{"text":"Authentic Asian cuisine with a lot of Asian patrons inside.... which is always a good sign! Came here with friends for a birthday party and we got one of those round tables. The menu is pretty huge with a lot of variety and we ordered about a dozen different plates to share and most plates were actually really good! In particular I enjoyed the spare ribs and sesame beef!

Service was on-point and friendly. The price-tag once shared turned out to be about average ($30). 

I'd go back if I was in the area with friends!"}
