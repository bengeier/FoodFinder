{"text":"Inside the layout is akin to a Hong Kong style bakery. All the baked goods are placed in clear cases to preserve freshness. It's self-serve; there are trays and tongs on the right. 

In addition to their bakery operation they offer 'made to order' sandwiches. 

I ordered a Bahn Mi Saigon for lunch (assorted deli meat sub) of which I ate there. Pretty impressed by how fresh and light the bread tasted I decided to take home a bag of baked goods for later. :)  I picked up a durian coconut bun, flaky pastry filled with chicken, and a coconut rice flour ball filled with peanuts and sugar. 

The costs were reasonable with sandwiches starting from $2.60 and topping out at $5, the bakery buns start from $0.80.  

There are familiar offerings like the custard buns, cream buns, hot dog buns, but they also have some unique pastry items too. Notably everything here is larger!  The durian coconut bun were double wide, the bacon and onion bun weaves are larger, coconut twist I saw were enormous!!  And not typical was durian filling in some of the pastries and buns.  

Mister Baguette ranks as one of the better Asian bakers I've gone to in the city. Freshness is apparent with some cool unique selections available."}
{"text":"Mister Baguette might not be familiar to most of you, however Nguyen Huong on the other hand might sound familiar to some specifically the Chinatown folks.  Vietnamese Sandwiches.

The interior setup is similar to most Chinese Bakery except the decor is much more welcoming and quite clean and sleek looking.  The prices here really make it and additional Lunch option for yours truly.  There are a few tables for eating in if you choose to order such things as Pastries, Breads, Buns, Tarts, Drinks, Cakes, Desserts, Banh Mi, etc...

By now if you're a Nguyen Huong regular, you would realize I haven't listed any Grocery, Deli or Prepared Food that typically line a whole side of each store.  This is more BAKERY oriented and it makes complete sense since a full size Vietnamese Grocery Store is only a few steps away.

Banh Mi Saigon($2.65) has the routine Ingredients of a Vietnamese style Baguette Sandwich. These are custom made Sandwiches therefore it uses 10 inch Torpedo shape Baguette rather than the rounder 6 inch Baguette.  Warmed just slightly so it's better than Subways Toasted Breads.   3.5 *Star*

DURIAN Crisp($1.80) I didn't consume at Lunch for the Health & Safety of my coworkers.  The consistency is excellent almost the same texture as the real Fruit itself although it doesn't have that intense STINK.  Flavour is light but then I believe it usually is, however it is slightly sweetened.  I will come back...

Other Baked Goods that had my curiosity: Durian Coconut Bun($1.20), Custard Bun($1.20), Steam Bun.  Great prices for Lunch and Snack."}
{"text":"A small Asian bakery tucked away behind shopping mecca, Vaughan Mills.

We stopped in to grab some buns and they had a range of the usual choices (BBQ pork, coconut, red bean, etc).  Prices are on par with Chinatown bakeries.

Loved its proximity to Hwy 400N.  Will be back to try the Vietnamese subs.  It's nice to know that there is an option to grab these for roadtrips out of town."}
{"text":"When I have a taste of Mister Baguette Vietnamese sandwiches, I don't believe that it is even remotely tasted like Nguyen Huong's! Their sandwiches here is 100% better!! 

The bread here is really thin and love how it is nicely toasted .... so crispy outside, nice and soft inside. Request extra spicy for my BBQ Pork Sandwich ($2.50), the only thing comment I have is here they use jalapeno instead of habanero chili... level of spiciness a little disappointed. 

Vietnamese Milk Coffee ($2.50) oh so oh so yummy!! I am indulging that as a dessert drinks.. since I usually have my coffee with just cream no sugar.. and this is like sweetened with condensed milk! The coffee is really strong too. 

Durian Crisp ($1.80) is a little disappointing. Durian flavour is not as intense as I would like (i.e. not stinky enough)... and the filling a little heavy. 

The lady here is so so friendly VS those nasty ones at Nguyen Huong Scarborough location. She was so excited to show me how she made my coffee with the dripper. 

They accepts interac for order over $10 if under there will be a surcharge of 20 cents."}
