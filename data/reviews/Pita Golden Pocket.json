{"text":"Incredible Shwarma and possibly the best shwarma wrap in the city.  The meat is tender and juicy with great flavour with fantastic fresh toppings. Friendly service and a very clean environment.  I will be back!!!"}
{"text":"Best shwarma place I have ever been to!! The service is so friendly and the shwarma was stuffed to the brim with juicy chicken!"}
{"text":"I seen this on cheap eats and highly recommended. Went in it looked plain from outside and inside decor was average. I ordered the chicken schawarma on pita and the amount of meat was incredible. I bit into while driving and simply amazing with extra garlic sauce. The staff are friendly and sincere they have me hooked for life no other place can meet expectations."}
{"text":"Extremely generous amount of chicken in their chicken shawarma. Very big. One of the best that I've ever ate. Very friendly staff that give you a warm welcome. Great selection of vegetables and sauces. Can't wait to come again!"}
{"text":"You've died and gone to heaven when you discover this gem in the heart of Concord. The wholesome family vibe, unbelievable sauces, and fresh meat/veggies make this the hands down best shwarma in the area. Not only will these pitas fill you up for the rest of the WEEK they will have you coming back again and again.   Simply put, as good as it gets!  -jb"}
{"text":"Finally found our go to shawarma place! My husband is Palestinian and finding a decent shawarma place has been an absolute mission. At the time we were living in Vaughan and pita golden pocket pooped up as a good near by place, we took a chance in checking it out and we're not disappointed.   We now live and Toronto, but still take the drive up when we want shawarma."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner the other night, and this place did not disappoint. Service was fast and friendly. I think (probably) the owner in the kitchen was greeting everyone that walked in. I ordered the shawarma wrap (~$10) and it felt like it was a foot long wrap. I had the usual veggies and toppings that go into it, which the guy loaded on, which already looked like a mini mountain. And then he comes back with all the meat he places it and smothers the wrap in delicious well-seasoned chicken meat. The dude making my wrap even suggested that I add the sesame sauce and \"special\" sauce, so I said, \"Sure! Why not\" Wow. Did not disappoint. Each bit was unique (mainly because it was so big and had to take small bites) you could taste each ingredient.  Super friendly, super delicious, and super stuffed. Overall, a great place to check out."}
{"text":"Came here after reading good reviews on Yelp. Had chicken shawarma for lunch. For the quality and quantity of the shawarma, I think $10 is pretty reasonable. The owner/staff were all very nice. I'll definitely come back here again."}
{"text":"I stopped by today after looking for a great shawarma place near Markham which none can be found. After checking on yelp pita golden pocket was the closet place to go therefore, I decided to check it out. I'm glad that i decided to come to pita golden pocket instead of other places. A 9$ shawarma wrap will feed a entire family with the amount of food they give you. The chicken was moist with a little crisp from being lightly charred. The toppings where freshly made and added great freshness inside the wrap. The in house hot sauce was amazing. None the less I will be a frequent customer to pita golden pocket. If you're around the area and haven't been then you're missing out!!"}
{"text":"Wow, one of the best Shawarma's in the city... Very friendly service...  Make a note that they are not open on weekends..."}
{"text":"Amazing. Have had schwarma all over...this is close to the top. Was greeted with a free sample of chicken that was as big as a whole portion I've gotten at other schwarma places. Huge portion, of perfectly seasoned moist chicken, layered expertly with toppings/sauce and wrapped perfectly, so little falls out, and every bites the same."}
{"text":"After reading the rave reviews I had to try this place. Very very good, but $2.50 for a coke? C'mon man.."}
{"text":"Took a 5km -- 25 minute drive to try the shawarma based on the great reviews shown here and elsewhere. I was definitely satisfied with my meal.  I watched a construction worker order a shawarma plate in front of me, and started to think that is what I wanted; the amount of chicken on his plate was unbelievable. I ended up sticking with my original choice -- the shawarma wrap -- and it was gigantic; I'm embarrassed to say that I was not able to finish it. But every bite I took was mouthwatering.  The service is friendly and the enjoy a conversation. I certainly recommend this place for anything on the menu (even though I only tried one thing) as I'm sure you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Holy smokes!!! This place is BOMB!! I've eaten a lot of chicken shawarma and they are serving the most flavorful and juicy I've had. Oh, and you better go hungry because they are throwing down wraps the size of my forearm. I can usually eat wraps/burritos like a python but this one tapped me out about 3/4 of the way through.  If you live in TO I strongly suggest you visit this place stat!  Shout to the very friendly gents that work there and own the joint I assume. My man was very meticulous and prepared my wraps like a master. He also kicked me a nice sample plate of shawarma while I waited. Unreal! I'm going to be back every time I come to town to visit my in laws. Nice job gents."}
{"text":"The best shawarma in Ontario! We discovered this hidden gem after a long search for good shawarma in the GTA.  Small eatery in the style of a casual sub sandwich shop, Pita Golden Pocket is tucked into a small strip mall along RR 7.  The amount of chicken they use on the pitas is unbelievable.  All of the toppings are fresh and handmade including a gorgeous mango sauce.  Get the works - you will not regret it.  Just as good as the food is the service.  The owner and his wife are truly beautiful people who love to chat.  We were even provided with a free freshly made falafel (the best! SO moist and full of flavor) on our first visit.  We have already been back for a second visit. Price works out to approximately $10 per shawarma, tax included.  It is HUGE.  If you have some kind of freakishly hollow stomach, you can eat 3 and get one free (one person, dine in only).  I cannot imagine how this is possible, and we are big eaters."}
{"text":"What can I say? The reviews don't lie! I checked this place out because of its ridiculous rating and I was not disappointed. I got the chicken shawarma and it was yuuggeeeee. Tell them to put everything on it and watch these pita artists go to work. I've had my fair share of chicken shawarma sandwiches and this is easily top 3."}
{"text":"mom and pop shop.. drove about 30 mins to get here.. here are the highlights  + super friendly family running the place + huge portions + average prices.. for the quantity   -  found their hot sauce and secret yellow sauce below par -  meats could have used more seasoning/bbq/shawarma taste"}
{"text":"Believe the hype with this place. I came here at about 2:30 today for a late lunch and I ordered a chicken shawarma pita. The sandwich and a bottle of water set me back $12, which is pretty standard.   The lady serving me asked if a wanted everything on my pita (I said yes, of course), asked if I wanted spicy (mais oui), asked if I wanted one or two lines of hot sauce (two, natch), and asked if I wanted the mango sauce (okay). Do exactly what I did and you'll be happy, my friend.   This pita was stuffed full. I would say it was about 60% chicken and 40% veggies and sauces. That is an incredible ratio! I have not seen this ratio anywhere else. The inverse is more likely, if you're lucky.  The norm is probably about 30% protein to 70% veggies and sauce at most places. If you like a lot of chicken in your chicken shawarma pita (and who doesn't?), then come here.  The chicken was flavourful and had great, crispy edges. So much yum. The veggies were super fresh even though I was here well after the lunch-time rush. The lettuce appeared to be romaine rather than cheapo iceberg. The tomatoes were nice and firm rather than mealy and slightly off.   The sauces were such a sympathy of flavours. They don't load up your pita too much so you're left with a saucy mess on your hands (and your clothing), but it's just enough to coat everything in lusciousness. The hot sauce, made in-house, is sort of a chunky pepper spread/sauce that reminded me of sambal in appearance. It is not thin and vinegary as a lot of commercially produced hot sauces are. You can really taste and see the peppers in this sauce. I, personally, loved it. But I love all hot sauces; I do not discriminate.   I don't know how you can spend $10 on a better or more filling chicken shawarma pita, to be honest. Also, the service was topnotch."}
{"text":"Fantastic - best wrap I've ever had! Listen to the guy making the wrap, he won't let you down. Go for all of the sauces, and don't forget the hot peppers."}
{"text":"I haven't been to many shawarma places to be able to compare, but the ones here are pretty good, and a lot larger than many places. They pile the meat up high before wrapping it up. There are times I find the meat a bit dry, but all the veggies and sauce make up for it. It is a family run business, and the owner is very friendly for all the times I have been here. A shawarma, after tax, is about $10 and it is very filling. I would definitely return."}
{"text":"By far the best and biggest Sharma you'll ever have in the York regional area! Very generous on their meats and super friendly. Most friendly owners, even noticed that it's my first time there. Definitely a place to go if you're feeling very hungry around the Vaughan area. Most likely will go back."}
{"text":"Quantity over Quality - HOWEVER   The quality isn't terrible but the SAUCES aren't up to par with the rest. The Garlic sauce (thomb) isn't garlic enough (OR it might be that the amount of chicken in it is over powering the sauce? Unlikely) if the garlic sauce was stronger ...would be a killer.   The chilli sauce is strong - good!   Rest is alrite   STILL - for $11 the size of the shawarma is ridiculous! Its about 4 regular Shawarmas at other places.     Imagine Fat Bastards biggest burrito - but full of meat!    Issue is timing, so not many people I know can try it!"}
{"text":"I can honestly say that one of my favourite things to eat is shwarma's . When I saw the ratings and reviews of this restaurant I definitely had to try swing by, and luckily my schedule permitted and I made sure I had to try. Like some of the other reviews had mention the place is an out dated hole in the wall.   Now for the food. I ordered the falafel wrap and chicken Shwarma wrap.   Already I lost interest because they don't have beef Shwarma.  What kind of Shwarma place that claims to be the best doesn't even serve beef Shwarma. I understand why the ratings are so high, it has nothing to do with food quality. Here QUANTITY rules over QUALITY. Now the Shwarma isn't bad but it's not great either. Nothing to write home about. Yes, there was an insane amount of chicken but the sauces lacked flavour. The garlic sauce was not up to par with any of my favourites in Toronto. I would not come back for this item.   Now for the falafel. Yes, now this was amazing. I saw them make the falafel fresh when I came in and ordered. I guess it helped I was the only person in the restaurants. But the falafels were full of flavour and nice and juicy and not over cooked. I would definitely come back for the falafel.   Still surprised at the high rating. Quantity doesn't always win over quality."}
{"text":"I've been going here for years. 1) i don't get sick of their meat even if i have it every day.  2) the amount of meat they put in is epic. 3) the people working there are simply good people. Its rare, but if your lucky and is a slow day just talk to the people working. You'll love them more then the food. 4) fantastic (the owner keeps saying that)"}
{"text":"I've been going to Pita Golden Pocket for many years, and i have to say, it is the best shawarma i've had anywhere, whether it be in Toronto, Ottawa, Montreal, Chicago, etc. (im sure you get the picture).   When you enter the restaurant, the owner, his wife, and/or son, will always greet you with a smile. and if you are regular, they remember you and what you do, etc.   Now the shawarma, where to start, the chicken is just right, juicy but still crispy, the toppings always fresh, and the in house sauce (especially the chilli sauce) are amazing.  There are very little restrictions in regards to the food here, if you want more of something just ask and they will add to the shawarma, double meat, more veggies, more sauce, it doesn't matter. But regardless of this, the feeling after you eat the shawarma (including being completely stuffed) is that you wish you had more room to finish the shawarma (yes it is that big).   The size of the shawarma is enough for two people easily, and if you are lite eaters, then 4.   There have been a few times, where i have gone closer to the end of the day (3:30 to 5), and they ran out of chicken for the shawarma, it was heart breaking. But the Falafel's are really good too (another must try)  Enjoy."}
{"text":"My kids love shawarma, probably it's in their blood as my hubby is half-Persian :) One of my family's favorite shawarma places is Pita Golden Pocket. The prices are excellent, the food is delicious. Pita Golden Pocket is a nice change from our standard meal when we order out. When my kids are happy and full, that makes me happy."}
{"text":"This place serves awesome shwarma. Abundant chicken and the size of your forearm  this is made the way you like it with  so many ingredients to choose. Ma and Pa operated and service with a smile and thank you always. Enjoy."}
{"text":"Little pricey compare to other Shawerma joints but you get what you pay for. There's enough meat in one sandwich to feed a family. Fries are pricey as well but are fresh cut and not McCain like most places."}
{"text":"Ok so I decided to give them another try because I can't give up on this place. It's still not as good as it used to be but much better than the last two times I've been. They are a very nice family and I have a soft spot for mom and pop shops. I'll give them a 4/5."}
{"text":"I live downtown but my wife works up in Vaughn near this place. A few of her co-workers had mentioned that this place is good so a while ago she decided to pop by and grab a couple of Shawarma wraps to bring home for dinner.   I have to say that I was very impressed and that's not too easy to do when it comes to Shawarmas as I have travelled quite a bit and been exposed to some great great shawarmas across Europe and the Middle East!  There are two key things that make the Wraps super great here. The first is a unique house made Mango sauce that they invented. I've never tasted anything like this at other places. The second key, and perhaps this only appeals to my big appetite, is that they serve HUGE Shawarmas! Their wraps are packed with lots of meat which is prepared to perfection and the experience is always pure joy.  I have only had equally huge wraps on two other occasions. In the Middle East ordering a Laffa Shawarma where their wraps are just as good as Pita Golden Pocket and at Dr. Laffa, here in Toronto, where their Laffa bread is admittedly amazing but their meat, sauces, and other ingredients are so mediocre that I've decided to never bother going again.  If you're way uptown, Pita Golden Pocket should be a guaranteed stop for you!"}
{"text":"If you don't like this place your opinion is wrong. Best chicken Shawarma I've ever had!!!!"}
{"text":"As a self proclaimed Shwarama connoisseur, this is the best Canada has to offer hands down. Not halal, owned by an Israeli family (Mr. Fantastic accompanied by his wife and son). The shwarma wrap is the iconic dish here. Prepare to spend your entire lunch break here because the line up is always long and the owners take the time to perfectly prepare each wrap and talk with their valued customers. Vegetables are bought locally/fresh and the sauces are out of this world flavorful! Garlic sauce, tahini, humus, SPECIAL SECRET SAUCE (pickled mango sauce), hot sauce are ALL VERY NECESSARY AND AMAZING!! The amount of perfectly cooked chicken shawarma  (not fried on flattop after, cut and served) is mind blowing. Has to be at least 1 1/2 chicken breast worth of shwarma layered on top of each wrap. Peel the wrap away and be ready for an orgasmic experience. Enjoy..."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. The food is always fresh and the service is great. You better be hungry before coming here because their portions are massive. If I could describe this place in one word it would be...\"FANTASTIC\""}
{"text":"Hands down the best value and taste of shwarma by genuinely nice people. Enough meat to feed 3-4 people. Amazing."}
{"text":"fat shawarma sandwich the way it should be . good flavour they add so much chicken  friendly staff clean restaurant  no complaints"}
{"text":"Best shawarma in the area. Absolutely packed with chicken. Chicken tastes amazing. Homemade sauces are amazing. Only 10$. Unreal in a quality shawarma derived area. Could contend as tops in any area really."}
{"text":"epic, simply epic.  Randomly came by here, as I had a business meeting nearby,  And HOLY SMOKES the falafel was incredible.  Like its not even a joking matter, best fallafel I've ever had in my entire life.  I can die happy now.  seems like a family business, full of good vibes and good energy, hope nothing but success for this beautiful family, and will definitely come back.   words can't describe, must TASTE in person ;)"}
{"text":"This place is great! The food is amazing, the size is an actual size of a football and the family that owns it are so nice! They are so warm and welcoming. At first we looked around the area and after pulling up the reviews on yelp we decided to give tho place a try and we weren't disappointed. Have gone back three times after that and ever time it's an enjoyable experience, they know how to make each customer happy besides giving them a great meal for a great price, just engaging in conversation is worth the visit, and like many people can agree with you'll most certainly be full and guarantee a \"bless you\" from the owner! Would highly recommend to anyone with an appetite and knows what great places taste like, not like the over hyped osmos or pita lands which can't compare to this place."}
{"text":"Drove here specially to try their Chicken Shawarma after seeing the 5* Yelp reviews - It is Da Bomb!! I ordered mine with everything except onions & banana peppers (did have jalapeños though), and all the sauces: tahini, secret sauce + spicy red sauce.  Took a \"Before & After\" set of pix: - Before the chicken landed - After the chicken landed How did he manage to wrap all that so neatly into a silver tube?!?   The friendly, older gentleman was greeting the regulars as he prepared my order. When I told him I sought the place after seeing great reviews, he was pleased. (This exchange happened after the chicken landed so there's no bias in the portion size.)  $10 for a lip-smacking Smorgasbord that fits in your hand. Can't wait for my husband to try one out - I'm gonna get brownie points for finding this gem!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing!  Shwarma was fresh, very tasty and great quality.   Very friendly service. And the wrap itself was too big for me to eat - portion size was huge! Would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Well.... this is going to be tough, I definitely had a different experience from my fellow Yelpers.   Staff was friendly but really pushy on what to order and not very accommodating of requests  (banana peppers on the side? No, can't do that). Instead of answering my questions I was told to order the chicken or falafel shawarma since it was my first time, and was told that would be enough for me (he was referring to the portion size). How do know how much I can eat? I know some petite women who can chow down! There was definitely a language barrier: European, maybe Russian? Okay... I guess it will be the chicken shawarma spicy with everything on it including their specialty pickled mango sauce. The best thing about my meal was the hot sauce and the Canada Dry Blackberry Ginger Ale, everything else was just ok. Menu is very limited.  Portions are HUGE and packed with meat so I'm rounding up my 2.5 rating to 3."}
{"text":"This place here has one great shawarma wrap, generous portions of all toppings leaves you more than satisfied. I'll definitely be back"}
{"text":"I call it the \"Football\" shawarma because the thing is the size of a football when it's done  HOWEVER I do dislike that they don't have any type of side dish whatsoever.  It's bizarre because their entire menu shows \"plates\" and \"dinners\" with rice and salads for those of us who don't typically get it in a wrap, and yet when you point at the picture and ask for it, they respond \"OH GOD NO WE DON'T HAVE RICE\" as if you just asked the strangest question in the world  I don't get it -- but the shawarma is as fantastic as the dude's hat says it is."}
{"text":"There is just WAY TOO MUCH meat in the wrap. I mean it's overly done. I like to taste everything in my wrap in one bite. All I could taste was the DRY chicken. Yes I said dry. The chicken is nothing special.  They don't even have beef! If you claim to be the best you should have beef as well.  I tried the shawarma plate another time and again! Tons of meat on top of my blah salad. The salad dressing is just oil definitely a let down but then again you can't even taste the salad cause it's just topped with insane amount of dry chicken.  I give them one star only because of their mango sauce. It's the only sauce they have that will actually give their chicken some taste."}
{"text":"Best shawarma I've had in the Toronto area, and I've had quite a lot of shawarma, so that's saying something. Huge portion for the price, great choice of sauces and toppings. Love the mango sauce."}
{"text":"Might be a favourite among a few people, but reviews don't necessarily seem to match the experience. Not super amazing, but not terrible as the food is pretty good.  Location:  So here's the thing, and I'll keep it short. This place is located in a strip mall on the north side of Highway 7 just east of Keele in Vaughan. It's in an \"industrial\" type of area where in and around are industrial, manufacturing, construction or the like.   To get here, you can only enter now coming Westbound on Highway 7.   Also, when you enter, this is a really dingy, run-down kind of place. No digital sign boards, no modern POS, no Shawarma Spit in the front with middle eastern music playing. It looks like a place badly in need of a reno. Even the food and toppings are presented in a way that you may not be confident if they're clean enough to eat. Now i'm saying this in jest of course of the food does a lot of the talking. They are also not open past 5pm.   Food:  That seems to balance out when you get some food. The pita or plates (I got the pita) was STUFFED. Literally STUFFED with food. It's a full meal. It has so much CHICKEN on it with a ton of the other veg. Now the pita itself has flaws, it's not toasted or grilled. It's just taken out of the bag and stuffed, but the flavour on the meat itself is tasty with that great shawarma flavour. They have hot sauce, garlic, etc. If you're hungry and want something to fill you up, then this is probably something to consider.  Value:  This is where I'm a little weary about coming back often. The cost of their chicken pita is somewhere around $11. When you consider the amount of food you can find for $11 for lunch, this really has to be something you're craving. It really is a lot of food, but again, given what it costs and how many better options there are around, this probably has to be something you really, really want.  2.0 out of 5.0"}
{"text":"I love this place, great food! The servings for the wraps are huge and the price is not so bad either. No matter how busy they are, they're always friendly and even call out to you to have a good day as you're leaving after your meal. Good food, good people."}
{"text":"I thought I had tried my fair share of shawerma places until I landed here. Holy mother!!! This place takes shawerma to a new level. So much chicken that I could not finish it. And I can eat. Ordered the salad with chicken shawerma. It was $15 but it had lots of meat, fresh veggies, yummy sauces and amazing flavour. Can't wait to come here again and again and again and ....."}
{"text":"Came here after a disappointing experience at Tov Li, and the contrast couldn't have been bigger. The staff were all friendly, and absolutely stuffed every single person's order- the women in front of me in line commented that their shawarma and salad would last them for more than 3 meals. Keep in mind that the hours are incorrect, it's open until 4pm during the weekdays."}
{"text":"Oh my god ! Mouth watering amazing place ever ! Very clean, very tasteful and very friendly"}
{"text":"Insane amount of chicken. Best shwarma in toronto hands down. I ordered the chicken shwarma and couldn't move for the rest of the day. I advise to eat half at a time (:"}
{"text":"I don't think I need to say that this is the best shwarma in town as all the other reviews state it very clearly.  Amazing food, made by fantastic people!!"}
{"text":"This place is great. The owner and his son are sweethearts and gave us samples while we waited for our shawarma. They were charming, welcoming and gracious and our shawarma was huge, loaded with meat and vegetables and downright delicious. Thank you for the hospitality, Golden Pita Pocket! This was a meal to savour, remember and repeat!!"}
{"text":"By far the biggest shawarma I've  ever had and one of the best, is supper  cheape  considering  the amount  of food you get."}
{"text":"Absolutely brilliant shawarma!!! By far the best I've had. Very generous portion and extremely nice owners.   Their biggest issue is the place looks old and rough, but definitely don't judge a book by it's cover!"}
{"text":"I went for lunch and there was a line and a bit of a wait to be served, but man was it worth it! The service is welcoming and friendly. The owner and workers acknowledge everyone that comes in and out of this joint.  They are very generous with all the toppings including the meat. I'm surprised on how they wrapped my chicken shawarma together so well it was so loaded! The chicken shawarma was so tasty, juicy and flavorful. It didn't taste like your usual basic shawarma. For 2 chicken shawarma and bottle of water and a can of Coke the bill came up to $24. My new go to spot when I'm craving a good shawarma in Vaughan."}
{"text":"Came here while on a trip for business. Was staying in the area, and wanted to get my fix of shwarma. I have had several of the places in and around Toronto before, so was excited when i saw this place.   Walked in........and was the only person there. A bit before dinner time.....Not a good sign.  Got a chicken shwarma sandwich and an order of falafel. Got my good, and the sandwich was HUGE. Almost double what most other places give you.  Best shwarma i have ever had. It was so full of flavor! While not a connoisseur, i have had my fair share, and this was my all time favorite.   The falafel was also very good. Came with two sauces drizzled on top, and each was equally as flavorful.  Will be coming back here for sure next time i am in town. Well worth the extra few minutes drive to get here."}
{"text":"I came here after seeing all the great reviews and they are definitely accurate. The portions here are huge and you may have difficulty finishing your meal. I got a shawarma wrap and it was loaded with chicken, veggies and sauces. One of the best shawarmas I've ever had. The service here was very fast and very friendly. While waiting for my wrap, one of the guys gave me a little taste of the chicken on a fork, and it was delicious. I will definitely be coming back again."}
{"text":"Went with my daughter for the first time. Owners were welcoming and helpful. We each had the chicken shawarma which was absolutely incredible! A must if you're in the area!!"}
{"text":"Ordered chicken Shawarma for $12. Half of it was cold veggies the other half chicken. Chicken was dry and chewy. Took chicken out to try by itself, not eatable."}
{"text":"I've driven by this place many times. After a friend of mine recommended it I thought I would try it. This must have been the best wrap I've had. The meal is so big I couldn't finish it. The chicken was amazing and the sauce they recommended complimented everything perfectly. The staff were amazing kind and friendly and even gave me a sample of the chicken before I ordered it. I will return when I'm in the area again. Keep up the great  food and service guys!!"}
{"text":"Wow, this is one serious Shawarma! This is by far the biggest Shawarma I've ever had. The topping options are plentiful and fresh and the hot sauce and mango sauce are home made. Both sauces are a must  try! The owners are proud and extremely friendly. They greet you when you enter and they thank you when you leave! Golden Pita Pocket is an already great experience."}
{"text":"Sat down for lunch with a few friends. Fantastic chicken shawarma, friendly and fast service. Price point is great, especially considering the huge portions and all ingredients very fresh. Recommend for anyone looking for a quick lunch. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"AMAZING.  This is by far, the best Shawarma place I have been to in Toronto.  The amount of chicken they give you in insane. They put enough meat inside to feed a small family. Chicken is always moist, tender, perfectly seasoned and very very fresh. They have tons of toppings, all fresh, and they are very generous with them. You want more or less of something, they give it to you, no problem. Must try the mango sauce!  The owners are incredibly nice and friendly and service is always top notch. Every time I go in, they give me a little sample of something, whether it be the chicken, or a piece of falafel. Clean inside and you will probably need to take home half your shawarma since it is so huge. They are always ready behind the counter to wrap your leftovers to go.   And all of this (plus a drink) for approx $10.  Again. AMAZING."}
{"text":"What not to love about Pita Golden Pocket?  The moment I walked in I came face to face with meat. I was even offered some free sample even though I know exactly what I want!  Shawarma Pita ($7.99) piled high with chicken while the nice man behind the counter trying to convince me to top it with every single topping until it would explose then rolled it in a pita bread that was cut in half. Amba Sauce? Hummus? Garlic Sauce? Hot Sauce?   Eyeing my lunch nicely squeezed and rolled, I can foresee what I messy it would be when I start eating that! But making a mess is half the fun! My Yelp friend kept shaking his head while sitting far far away from me... with jalapeno rolling all over the place!  Falafel ($6.99) Pita though has the same topping but lack the meaty smokey flavours. I have not idea when my Yelp friend becomes vegetarian? But he kept eyeing my chicken and asked if I should just cut that half with a knife? Why?!! Why?!!  Pita Golden Pocket is to date one of the best Shawarma I had. Love the people working there, so friendly and cheerful!  I will be back!"}
{"text":"Best place ever for shawarma. I'm a regular and my whole family comes by to eat here here and there and they always know how to spoil their customers. Great service and a great spot for lunch!!"}
{"text":"There was much boasted about the food here so I decided to try it for myself. I think I'm going to break this down in different areas so that I can fairly give you the details. I walk in and there is lots of talk by the owners on how good the food is, how Yelp is a big supporter and how long they have been there without advertising. The place itself is old looking and looks like an old style KFC with wooden chairs and bench seats against the wall. Parking was ample and can be found right in front of the place.  I asked about choices and was told to choose either Chicken or Vegetarian that's it... all other choices that were previously available have been removed from the menu!! We ordered 2 chicken shawarmas for a whopping $9.72ea and a coke for another $2.00bucks each, no combo's are available, total bill with tax for two $26.00!!. Not sure if pricing has gone up recently, but this does not seem to the same in previous reviews. At this point I know the shawarma's are large but I can't help feel like I've been overcharged for a sandwich wrap. Also, at $13.00 per person($11.72 pre tax), this bumps the pricing category from under 10 ($) to 11-30 ($$) per person. I'm not sure why my fellow yelpers have ignored that?  The flavors of the chicken shawarma was VERY good and the portion size was large (for a sandwich) but, having eaten shawarma in the past, I still could not get over the price and what I could have eaten instead, but I digress. The sandwich ate like a story book, juicy at the beginning, kind of dry and plain in the centre then juicy again towards the end. They don't warm the sandwich in a press so the pita is plain and cold. I can definitely see why the food is liked by many as the chicken they use is well seasoned from the spit.   Menu selections seem to have been recently chopped down to 2 types of dinner/shawarma, Chicken or Falafel (Veg). Most of the menu board in the background had the pricing blacked out,this makes this place less interesting if you are looking for variety.   I'm rating it 4 stars based mostly on the hype and good food, but given the old outdated decor and high prices combined with limited menu, I think I'm being very generous. I would certainly increase my rating if some of the negative issues were addressed and decor was updated. I also read up on some of the inspection warnings they had in the past and was not impressed  since most rated this place 5 stars at that time. As they say, love is blind and it's true, a way to someone's heard truly is through their stomach."}
{"text":"If you get me to do a 5-star review, you got something special in my books. This place isn't fancy, have super hot gals in tight mini skirts serving you the latest cocktails, or have super duper interior design with exotic animal skin seats...all of those which would add up to a really weird place. If you can provide me with great food, and an excellent experience - you got me at 5...stars. The place is recessed from Hwy7 in a strip mall next to national sports near Keele.  The recent roadway constructions made it difficult to to get to it from the eastbound traffic side.  It's unassuming red and white sign and simple pictures of food on the windows doesn't say much to draw you in but you should go. I walked in and a gentleman was cutting some shawarma as I stepped to the counter.  A warm hello and an offer to have some of their own seasoned meats.  I knew what I wanted but he promptly came around with a sizeable sample of his goods.  And it was Good! I asked for a shawarma on a pita and it took him no time to cut a healthy portion of meats onto the open pita.  He wanted to know how I wanted it and I asked him to dress it as he would have wanted to have one.  He proceeded to layer on goodness after goodness.  He also put on all their homemade dressing.  After he rolled it up, he told me to open by tearing around the top portion of the double wrap and work my way down. I was on the way to a client office nearby and I was hungry.  I lifted the wrap out of the bag and it was heavy!  I unwrapped a portion of the top and it was going to explode and make a mess.  I had decided to wait before enjoying it. When I finally got to eating.  I told myself this is way to big for one sitting...uhm...no...it was too good to put down. The best Shawarma Wrap ever!  Well so far! Great food, great people - totally deserving on my 5 and their current 5 start Yelp rating! Be prepared for a food coma after.  I didn't even make it to my last meeting.  :)"}
