{"text":"The original chicken without any of the spicy sauces is very good. Great flavor, moist and crispy crust. But if you choose to get any of the sauces (tossed to order), ask for sauce on the side. I wasn't aware so I got my chicken tossed in the sweet and spicy sauce and although I can take heat, this was mind-numbingly spicy. All of your taste buds will be burned off for the day. I had massive FIRE BUTT all day as well. Get the sauce ON THE SIDE!!!"}
{"text":"The olive fried chicken was excellent.  Have had it twice so far.  Looking forward to trying the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"I ordered their original olive chicken and their sweet and spicy chicken. This place is pretty pricey for the food that you get, but I will say that their original olive chicken was a good starter to go with. However, I think their sweet and spicy chicken was a bit over spiced. I normally am okay with medium spicy foods, but this was way too spicy for me.   I got my food relatively quickly, although the service seemed chaotic in the back. I also got the wrong order, which I didn't notice until later (I got take-out). I wish they had more options (especially with their garlic trio option - I would've liked to have been able to try one or two of those flavors without having to order all three), but this place seems decent. Their menu screen kept flickering, which was slightly annoying when I was trying to read the menu. I'd honestly probably wait a couple of weeks to a month before coming here again, and hopefully by then they've added more options / finished polishing their recipes.  side note: Thank goodness I ate the original chicken first, because after the sweet and spicy chicken, I could hardly taste anything because my mouth had gone numb."}
{"text":"I've gone here twice and I'm surprised that both times I've never been served warm or hot food. I feel like the food is taken out from a freezer and placed under a hot lamp to thaw and then covered with sauce. Nothing seems to be cooked. Unfortunately, regardless of whether or not the chicken is at a good serving temperature, it's also not crispy nor tasty. I'm disappointed that this place cannot make a decent plate of the one thing they sell--chicken.  Food: 1/5"}
{"text":"One of the best chicken places in Champaign. Ordered the sweet spicy chicken, as was recommended. Took a while to get the food and the price is relatively expensive, but no complaints about the taste. The chicken was crunchy? on the outside and super tender. The sauce complemented the chicken well and wasn't too spicy. It was a little bit messy though."}
{"text":"It was such a great one but it took long time to get it. And they made a mistake to make foods and did not keep the number or order. I think that they aren't ready to business. Otherwise, their fried Chickens are awesome and very delicious except their services."}
{"text":"Chicken doesn't taste fresh at all. Waffle fries are hard and tough, with the consistency and taste of plastic. My fond memories of middle school cafeteria waffle fries have been ruined by some of the worst food I've ever choked down."}
{"text":"Came here today to get some waffle fries. Waited in front of the counter for 5mins the the phone rang at the store. Instead of taking my order first or even a simple apology the employee answered the phone first despite me being there first. Finally after I was acknowledged, I asked about there waffle fries and was disappointed to find out that they cook a vegetarian item waffle fries- potato) in oil fried with chicken.. That is big NO in food industry. Also I politely asked if they would make a fresh batch of waffle fries in fresh oil instead of the old chicken oil.. they refused.  Moral of the story - do not trust a business that choose to put customer last.  Fair warning folks."}
{"text":"I think this place has gotten a bad rap in the past which originally kept me from dining here. However, after finally giving in it's been one of my go to restaurants. I am a basic person so I always go for the boneless sweet & spicy chicken and mozzarella sticks. As a full meal I usually get this for around $11 (w/extra cheese sticks) and always leave more than full! The chicken is always quality (crisp on the outside, tender on the inside) and sauce is perfect addition. As for the service I think people expect food service workers to always be fake smiling in your face and they don't do that here and that's oki with me. The food does all the hard work so as long as I'm being taken care of, forced smiles and banter are unnecessary. I would like to explore more of their menu in the future!!"}
{"text":"Tl;dr: stick with the classics and you're golden. Lots of hits and misses but it could shape up to be a great place.   Atmosphere: 5/5  The place is really nicely decorated and the tables are comfy and roomy. It reminds me a lot of Asian KFC, which makes a lot of sense. The chairs are comfy and while there's a lot of places to sit, it's not too cluttered to navigate easily. I really like their wall art! It is loud so it might be kind of hard to hear at times.   Menu: 3/5  Their menu is limited right now so double check your orders cause they might not have it in stock yet. There are some definite hits and misses. For example the Cheeseling is terrible but the Sweet Spicy and Original are great. Beware of things that don't look like the pictures provided.   Quality: 4/5  Im taking an extra point off for how old and cold the Cheeseling my friend ordered was but the rest seemed pretty good in terms of quality. You can even see the steam when you break open a piece of chicken! The side dishes aren't worth it in my opinion, except for maybe the biscuit. Rice is mushy and Cole slaw is watery.   Service: 2/5  Beware it is very,  very slow right now but hopefully once the employees get into the swing of things stuff picks up. I didn't take off any stars for the wait, which was hopefully a temporary thing. When I went on opening day, I waited about an hour for my order. The employees are nice enough and they're helpful, I just get the feeling they're under trained and under staffed right now. Also,  I really wish they'd put the water dispenser as a self service thing,  same with plates (you don't default get any so you have to ask for them.) They have wet wipes with their condiments which is great cause you're gonna get messy."}
{"text":"I ordered two pic for to go it took me 15mins stand by and they just send my order. The chicken is not that good"}
{"text":"First I think the name of the restaurant is wrong.  Calling it BBQ when it's really not BBQ is confusing.  The food is not bad but there are very little side dishes.  Since its Korean, there should be little more effort in offering some kind of salad or ban chan.    I do want to try their chicken and beer next time."}
{"text":"This is the best fried chicken in Champaign-Urbana.  They cook in olive oil which keeps the skin crispy but not overly hard and the inside moist and delicious.  The restaurant is always clean and the staff is very friendly.  Most of the negative comments here were posted before BBQ became a cook to order restaurant.  They were right when the chicken was displayed for hours in their display case but now, it's cooked when you order it and it is delicious.  You owe it to yourself to give them another try."}
{"text":"We only ordered two pieces original chicken and waited forever. There was only one person at the checkout while there were so many customers. People came way later than we did got to eat first and their Chicken taste like plastic."}
{"text":"Ordered the 5 piece chicken strips with honey mustard sauce. My complaint is that the order took an oddly long time and the sauce was cold (as if they just took it straight from the fridge and didn't bother warming it). But the chicken was soft, fresh, and VERY hot (needed to wait a little bit longer for it to be edible, even the fridge cold sauce couldn't cool it off fast enough). A lot of wait necessary. I also don't recommend the food for people with acid reflux (like me), but if you want an off day this is far from bad."}
{"text":"I would rate 0 star if I can. I thing they are using expired chicken. I ordered original and soy garlic chicken. Both have a very strange taste. I even found some feather on the chicken wings. I was the only customer in the store and it took 20mins to get two items ready. No doubt why the business is gloomy here. If u are reading this, you are luckier then me cuz you don't have to go through this sht experience and dump your food feeling guilty."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch on a Wednesday. I wanted to try Basil Thai or Bab Plus, but the lines were too long for my time constraints. So, I decided to try BBQ Premium Chicken. I was hoping it would be just like Jip Bap (on 6th street, just north of Green), and I was pretty disappointed. I ordered the cup with sweet and spicy chicken and rice for take-out, per the recommendation of the cashier.   The rice to chicken ratio is off - way too much white rice left over with pretty much zero flavor. The chicken was crispy, but again, the flavor wasn't amazing.   I'm just a white girl that doesn't know much about authentic Korean cuisine, but I've had MUCH BETTER on campus. Namely, Spoon House and Jip Bap. I would definitely recommend Jip Bap 100 times before recommending this place for a much more flavorful version of a similar dish.   Wait wasn't too long, but the restaurant was nearly empty. Decor is nice."}
{"text":"Absolutely shit. First of all, shit taste. Their original chickens are soggy as hell and taste like white paper.  Today I gave it a second chance to try their spicy chicken. They put hot sauce on chicken directly and it is so spicy that I can't handle it with even one bite. This restaurant didn't even ask me if I want sauce on side because it is super spicy. Second, it is supposed to be a fast food restaurant but the average waiting time is over 15 minutes. Crispy KFC chicken is way much better and cheaper."}
{"text":"Service isn't great. Tables were dirty and I had to ask them to wipe it down. The menu is extremely limiting. They don't let you pick and choose the kind of sauce you want on the two piece chicken, they only allow you to buy extra sauce on the side if you want to try the other sauces. They don't let you pick the kinds of pieces of chicken you want. The combo meals for chicken only include a two piece. The prices are a bit much.  Having said all that the chicken was amazing. We got the half and half whole chicken. Half original olive oil and half sweet and spicy sauce. The flavor on the original was amazing and made you want to eat the sweet and spicy chicken and vice versa. The fry on the chicken couldn't be more perfect and the amount of breading used was also perfect. I couldn't get over how juicy and perfectly fried our chicken was.  I don't know if this was a fluke and I would guess that you need to be as lucky as I was and get the chicken fresh out of the deep fryer. I know that they have pre-fried chicken under the heater, which I haven't tried. But if you can get it freshly fried, it is amazing."}
{"text":"Based on the raving review of a guy who just exited this place, my friend & I decided to come back & try the chicken. She ordered the classic olive oil fried chicken with sweet spicy sauce. I ordered the boneless sweet spicy chicken meal ($8.75). The boneless chicken was hard & the sauce was not spicy. I had this with some dry waffle fries & a lemonade. My friend's chicken (2 pieces) was a bit better since her chicken was tender. But she thinks she can reproduce this dish by smothering fried chicken with gochujang & simple syrup. We thought the price was too much for what we received. Korean chicken comes with much hype. But what we found here didn't live up to it. Now we know."}
{"text":"I like the most spicy Garlic trio-red hot garlic. Order it ever time I have been there."}
{"text":"They use low-quality chicken. The tables are dirty. The price is high for no reason. I feel like they are trying to dupe us into thinking that's korean chicken. No they are not."}
{"text":"Got half sweet & spicy and half gang-jeong flavored bbq chicken. Sides: waffle fries & mozzarella sticks.   I liked how they have plastic gloves available when eating your chicken to keep your hands clean. The chicken was flavorful and extremely tasty and hot temperature wise!   The only downside was that it was quite pricey for what you get"}
{"text":"Their chickens are not made to order, and the tables were dirty, crumbs everywhere. Seems like they were not following the original recipe from BBQ Korea which is totally fine if it taste great but unfortunately nahhhhhh.   The honey garlic wings taste nah-ah Korean sauce, not even close to it. The chickens were not hot, it was just warm temperature because they let out the food that is already cooked whatever hours before.   I agree when  KFC does this cause it is fast-food store with cheaper price. However BBQ costs way more than KFC but still providing chickens already cooked? I never saw any other BBQs in United State do that. All other retail BBQs are made to order, tastes the same (I went the other BBQs in VA, NY). I will never go to this place ever unless they change their policy. Go star karaoke if you want korean style chicken or KFC for salty huge fried chicken."}
{"text":"I was craving Korean Fried Chicken and called a pickup order for a full chicken to share with my friends. We ordered olive fried and sweet spicy and picked it up in 10 minutes. We happily went home to eat it, but after one bite of the sweet spicy, our mouths were on fire and it turned out they gave us the wrong flavour. Also, the fried chicken was also just tossed with the sauce and therefore spicy flavour was only 1/2 covered with sauce.   Anyhow, we went to go return switch it back. NBD everyone makes mistakes and they apologized but we had some trouble communicating what went wrong because they seemed really frazzled and busy even though the store was almost empty.   The chicken was alright, not great but I think it wasn't worth the money or the hassle.   TL;DR  Taste 3/5, Serivce 2/5"}
{"text":"I like it. It's okay. I did see one of the cooks touch food with his bare hand, though. But really, the chicken is pretty good but I hope it gets better!!!"}
{"text":"Overall I had an okay experience here. It was quite a wait for the food. You can tell it's kind of new because orders were stacking up and they may not have had enough staff in the back. The menu has  a variety of fried items and rice bowls (priced at 6.95) and some random soup items (one priced at 16.99...crazy).  I got the spicy pork rice bowl.  Maybe 30 or so minutes later our food came. It was deliciously flavored and a good amount of rice. I think some of the pork pieces had too much excess fat on it and there could have been a side of some vegetables. There were some onions in it. I liked it but I don't see me craving to go here. It was yummy but items seemed overpriced for what was given. Considering the long wait, I think I'll try another place for sure!"}
{"text":"Restaurant review: Olive oil fried chicken sort of has a healthy ring to it doesn't it.... This review is mainly for the original fried chicken. i have read that a lot of the other friend chicken with sauce are quite soggy and not very good. Personally the original fried chicken is quite crispy and has a clean flavor to it based on the oil used for frying. This leans to a crisp fried chicken instead of the chunky hard fried chicken you get at other fried fast food restaurants. The only issue is that the fried chicken comes at a cost. it is unbelievably expensive and the chicken pieces are also quite small. With that, it is good for a 1 time experience, but I will take my fried chicken cravings elsewhere.   Pros: olive oil to fry chicken, waffle fries  Cons: Very expensive, takes a while to prepare the chicken sometimes  Hidden deals: None  Health code rating: A. Overall clean interior, new. http://il.healthinspections.us/champaign/estab.cfm?facilityID=2319"}
