{"text":"I'll be back, probably many times. I am a big fan of thai food, and am spoiled with what I believe is the best Thai restaurant in the US (Ricky Thai Bistro) near my place in Florida. When I'm in the burgh, Thai Cottage does an admirable job filling that craving for curry. The pumpkin is amazing!"}
{"text":"Ordered takeout for pickup at 4pm on a weekday. The woman who took my order made sure I understood I would be charged dinner prices, and I said this was fine. I ordered the chicken satay, green curry, and pad see eew, which came to thirty-some dollars.   Was disappointed upon getting home and unwrapping the seriously small portions. I couldn't believe that even the white rice container was only 3/4 full. They are seriously skimping on white rice? I'd put the portion size at maybe 60% of other Thai restaurants nearby (e.g. Bangkok Balcony or Curry on Murray), but at nearly the same prices.   The saving grace was that the food was delicious. Perhaps portion sizes are better in-house?"}
{"text":"Okay. So vegetarian doesn't mean anything here. Me and my wife have been vegetarian for 32 years (read all life) and our pick up order of Veg. Fried Rice had chicken pieces in it.  In case you are wondering I repeated my order at least 7 times. Disgusted for life...."}
{"text":"It was a great dining experience for the both of us; from the moment we stepped  over the threshold warm and inviting staff set the tone for a great visit. In addition to r hearsay atmosphere the food was great, bold full flavors a definite Thai \"go-to\"!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat in Pittsburgh. I've tried most of the dishes on the menu. I'm not much of a fan of tofu, but their sunrise tofu will even make the most carnivores person happy. The fresh roles are also amazing as are their curry dishes (pumpkin curry is at the top of my list). The atmosphere is as good as the food and the byob option is nice."}
{"text":"The Green Mango it is not! I had the Basil Ginger Fish and it was way too salty and too hot. I asked for a 5 out of a scale of 10 since it was my first time at the restaurant and figured I could add hot oil if it was too mild. To my dismay it was too hot and lacked distinct flavors other than the salt.  The friend I was with is from what we call the \"clean the plate club\" but she did not clean her plate also stated that food was too salty.  Very disappointing overall. The service was also slow and they were not that busy. I will not be returning. I will have to drive the extra miles to Monroeville."}
{"text":"I was not expecting anything special when I sat down for dinner with my dad, but the food was great! We ordered vegetarian spring rolls which were very flavorful. I got the mango curry for my meal which I was afraid would be too sweet but it was spiced perfectly and really just tasted like red curry with a hint of mango flavor. The service was decent. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I had the Kee Mao chicken with spicy 3 and i loved it. Perfectly portioned and just spicy enough. The staff knows me and always is kind."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, BYOB, and I like the new decor. When the weather is nice there is outdoor seating for 2 top tables."}
{"text":"This is the best restaurant in Regent Square.   I've had several dishes, all of which are excellent. In my opinion, this is also the best Thai in Pittsburgh.  Shrimp Pad Thai is fantastic. Good portion eat in or take-out, with tons of big, juicy shrimp. The Cottage Wings are quite honestly the best wings I've had in Pittsburgh. I could probably eat 20+ of these things at a time. Everything I've eaten has been perfect.  The staff is also very welcoming. The taller lady (I think she may be the owner or manager) always greets us with a friendly smile, kind words, and excellent service. She seems to really be doing what she loves (and she's doing a great job). We have never waited for a table here, even with the place being as tiny as it is.  My girlfriend and I live close enough to walk to this place, and we do so on a fairly regular basis. It's our go-to if we want to stay local.  The only (small) complaints are as follows: They serve soda in cans, but this is sort of the modus operandi for a lot of Thai restaurants, so I can't really come down too hard on them for this one. The other issue is how close the seating can be, but this sort of thing comes with the territory in the city."}
{"text":"3 friends and I met for dinner at 6pm on a Monday evening. I was surprised by the amount of activity in a week night. Needless to say, we we're seated immediately.  Service was good and our food came out quickly. I ordered the tamarind tofu--crisp fried tofu with peppers, onions, broccoli, carrots, and tamarind sauce over rice. The flavor was alright, although I feel the quality is tending toward that of the typical Chinese restaurants that cater to a non-Chinese clientele--lots of sauce to cover up all the other ingredients.  We brought out own wine, which is nice to be able to do.  I will be back with the hope that the restaurant starts to improve. Prices are a little high for the flavor and quality of the food. There are better Thai restaurants in town, including the standard against which I judge all others, Thai Gourmet in Bloomfield."}
{"text":"This is the spot that used to be called The Green Mango. We had lunch here and wondered why the menu had changed so drastically. When we walked out, we finally noticed that the sign was different. It seems that this is under new ownership.   The menu has changed drastically. Don't look for your old favorites, because they won't be there. There are still plenty of vegetarian options, but the two dishes we shared weren't as good as the ones we'd had when this was still The Green Mango. I ordered the Kang Paneng, which is veggies and tofu in a red curry/coconut sauce. It was not spectacular, but ok. My dining partner ordered the Rad Na--flat rice noodles and veggies in a \"special gravy.\" Again, not spectacular, but ok. Lunch comes with a soup (didn't try) or an unremarkable green salad. I'm sure we'll be back, because it's a great vegetarian lunch option nearby, but I will miss the Green Mango every time."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I tried this place for the first time tonight and we loved it! We live in the area so it's nice to know there's a great Thai place right around the corner (though I never got the chance to try Green Mango).  We got to sit outside because it was beautiful out (what's up winter?), and were immediately greeted with two waters. We ordered the fresh rolls to start--enticed by the basil and mint leaves and the peanut dipping sauce--and they arrived not 2 minutes later (and were delicious!)  Next we split an entree, (also out in mere minutes) and it was plenty of food for both of us. We had the pork pad gra prao and it was very tasty (though spicy so watch out! we asked for medium spice and I'm glad we did because it definitely had a kick).   Our total came to $17 for both of us, and we left feeling comfortably full--not overstuffed. The servers here are so friendly and the food was great. I foresee us becoming regulars! :)"}
{"text":"This is an upstart restaurant, but they've been mentored by one of Pittsburgh's best Thai chefs. The food is good, the service is on point, and they're fortunate to be building on the success of the previous restaurant that occupied the same space. It's hard to beat that location, too."}
{"text":"Everything is perfect and delicious. And in the summer you can have some seats outside with your friends, there has friendly staff. You can also order thai food by using their website. (thaicottagepgh.com). Nice place!!"}
{"text":"I stopped by after a movie at Regent Square, and we were delighted, no wait, good Thai, decent price.  It's BYOB, but there's no fee for corkage, and I agree with the other reviewer who mentioned the only detracting factor is the spice level.  I asked for a 10 and it was quite mild, definitely not a Thai 10, but still good."}
{"text":"Everything here is just OK. The Pad Thai, was palatable, but sadly it made me want to go to Noodlehead. Where it is both cheaper and much better tasting. The red curry was thin and weak, not nearly as flavorful as other establishments.   Again, the food was good, not great. And it was definitely more expensive than it should be for the quality and quantity given."}
{"text":"One of my favorite dishes is pineapple fried rice and they did it right here! It was delicious.  I did a 5 on the spice scale and it was a strong 5 but not too spicy.  This was my first time doing tofu for the protein as well.  I liked the tofu, I think it would be considered medium or firm in terms of firmness. It was a little squishy, but not like a sponge.  We also shared the appetizer platter, cottage combo with meat.  All the items on the platter were very good and the variety of sauces were great and flavorful."}
{"text":"This place has such great food. Thus far I've had their dumplings, calamari, and Mango Tofu. The Mango Tofu is amazingly delicious and I'm not even a vegetarian.  My fiance loves the seafood special, which I'm also particularly fond of.  The staff is also very friendly and attentive. Overall, my favorite Thai place by far!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing.  The curry was delicious; the prices are reasonable for the area;  the staff was friendly.  My wife loves Thai food, but I usually can't stomach it.  The food here, however, was the best Thai food I've ever had in America.  This was our first time here, but we will be coming back!"}
{"text":"If I had written this review a year ago, I would have been raving about Thai Cottage.  My favorite dishes are Pad Se Ew and shrimp fresh rolls.  Until recently, the food was always consistently good and the service in the restaurant when Belle is working is second-to-none.  I have no reason to doubt that the service is still great in the restaurant.  However, the quality of the food that I've been getting from Thai Cottage for delivery has deteriorated over the last 6 months.  Today, I ordered my usual and the See Ew was sweeter than usual and lukewarm (that could be a Grub Hub issue), the shrimp fresh roll had a shrimp shell in it and whatever they did to the peanut sauce should be undone. The new peanut sauce is very sweet and it lacks the kick that the old peanut sauce had. The pad se ew was supposed to be medium spicy, but there was not heat to it at all.  Also, you used to get either soup or salad with your lunch entree.  But, now, you only get one fried cheese won-ton.  I'm sad.  I don't know if Thai Cottage changed hands or if they got a new chef... but, the changes aren't for the better.  Let's hope things improve.  I want to love this restaurant again."}
{"text":"Such a good, small, cozy place.  Took my mom on a whim she got Pad Thai and and ordered off my normal type of Thai  (massaman) and instead ordered Kao Soy noodle bowl with seafood.  pad Thai was very good but the noodle bowl was really good. The seven was just spicy enough to make you sweat in a good way.  So much flavor, veggies and seafood.  Fantastic service, portion and price.  With wine from nearby Edgewood Town, this was a great place on a cold Monday night."}
{"text":"Great food and service. The Thai fried rice isn't as spicy as some of the curry dishes."}
{"text":"Over all this place gets high marks. The service was great and the food was very good. Very friendly and attentive service. Will definitely come back if I'm in the area.."}
{"text":"Some of you may have noticed, the Green Mango packed up and moved out of its Regent Square location. If you didn't notice that the space has become Thai Cottage you could be forgiven, since not much has changed, save some of the art on the walls.   That is, until you open the menu.   I had grabbed a take out menu on a prior non-eating excursion down in the Square and had given it a good look-over. I was pretty sure by the time GFgf picked me up, that I was going for the pumpkin curry with tofu & veggies, of course. When we were seated, the hostess gave us special menus along with the standard. I noted a Tamarind tofu (fried tofu over steamed veggies in a tamarind sauce) and a Sunrise Tofu (same with a peanut chili sauce).   We asked the waitress about gluten free options, but ended up speaking with a woman from the kitchen who might be the owner. She said all of the curries are GF. We asked if the fresh rolls were safe & she said she would double check the wrapper package to make sure there is no wheat in them. Turns out they were a go. When she served them, she brought us both a sweet and sour and a peanut sauce since the sauce they normally serve with them is not GF.   The rolls and the sauces were delicious!   Though swayed by the specials, I stuck with the pumpkin curry, as it was a chilly, dreary night. GFgf went with the Massaman with shrimp, and we both got brown rice.   GFgf's curry was loaded with shrimp & she gobbled them up with pleasure. The pumpkin in my dish was creamy and flavorful. The spice level (6) had heat without losing the complexity of the spices. There was a nice blend of other veggies and the tofu was cut into bite-size pieces and lightly fried so they blended in nicely to the dish (as opposed to those big chunks of flavorless fresh tofu so often dumped into Asian dishes).   Our initial foray indicates that Thai Cottage's predecessor will not be missed long. We'll definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"This is my go to Thai spot!  The staff is great and the restaurant has a cozy feel.  It's BYOB and there are several spots on the street to grab good beers or wine.  If you're in Regent Square look it up!  Also great for carry out!"}
{"text":"I've only been here once, but the som tum was some of the best I have had in Pittsburgh. It was well made with just the right consistency. I need to go back soon!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Thai restaurant in Pittsburgh. My husband and I order take out from here once/week. The staff are extremely friendly and my food is always ready when I come in. I typically order the tofu pad thai but my husband switches his order all the time and has yet to order something he doesn't like. I highly recommend this restaurant if you are in the mood for thai!"}
{"text":"Sweet little place that doesn't look like much on the outside, but they make the best massaman curry I've ever had.   Their servers are always very pleasant and prices are pretty reasonable.  Great place for lunch!"}
{"text":"I am baffled by the amount of good reviews this place has. I came to Thai Cottage for dinner this weekend as a \"second chance\" after my first experience was sub-par a few months ago.   I ordered the see ew and it tasted burnt and had no flavor and minimal spice, despite the fact that I asked for a spice level 10. Noodles were cooked perfectly, but the flavor was nonexistent. My first experience yielded tasteless pad thai and I was hopeful that was an off day, but I was disappointed again. There are MUCH better Thai restaurants in the Pittsburgh area. This one is permanently off my list--try Thai Terrace (nearby) instead."}
{"text":"spice level is american and not Thai I love Pai Thai at this place"}
{"text":"I had the shrimp pad thai (spice level 3) and my date had chicken thai spicy fried rice (spice level 4) as a side we had chicken spring rolls...  Portion size was excellent  Food quality was excellent  Level 3 spice was perfect for me because I don't really want it to burn  Level 4 spice was where the spice level took off and you'll get a residual burn  The atmosphere was cozy definitely a nice place for a date or even a group gathering, but it's a small place so if it's packed you're probably not going to be seated for a while.  Service was decent... no issues, but I don't think the wait staff was very experienced... most likely a family... overall I was happy.  Oh and as a bonus they let you bring your own drink so B.Y.O.B.  Prices were also not bad... my bill came to 33.00 not including tip"}
{"text":"Wow. This place is just a few blocks from my house but I wanted far too long to try it. I love Thai and this place has to be the best Thai place I've tried in Pittsburgh. The serve, Bell, was so friendly and funny. Definitely added to the enjoyment of the place.  Portions were generous. I got the lemon grass soup (great) and glass noodle Pad Thai--WOW. Loved it. This will be my go to place!"}
{"text":"Good food, pleasant service, cozy and pleasant atmosphere. Prices are very reasonable. I had the eggplant dish and it was cooked just right"}
{"text":"Service was excellent, but food was just okay."}
{"text":"Great thai food - good service. Nice menu selection. I had pad thai and tofu soup - the soup was so fresh, full of vegetables, and delicious and the pad thai was ginourmous and also delicious!"}
{"text":"I came here with friends and was pleasantly surprised. I was never impressed by Green Mango, but decided to try Thai Cottage. The hostess is the same hostess/server that used to work at Smiling Banana Leaf, and she is a dear. Always attentive and helpful, the service is very good.   I had the red curry and my friends had various entrees such as pad kee mao, green curry, and several salads. Everything looked and smelled delicious. The fresh rolls are delicious as well, and I love that there are other delicious Thai options in Pittsburgh other than my usual Smiling Banana Leaf, Nikki's, and Pusadee's Garden.  If you find yourself in Regent Square, definitely try Thai Cottage."}
{"text":"Really surprised that this restaurant changed hands, but it really seems to have improved by the sale.  The dishes are more authentic, and the staff could not be friendlier.  Lots of great options to choose from, and the food was delicious.  I don't typically buy dessert, but I was tempted to try the pumpkin with sticky rice, and it was great. I very much recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"So I very rarely complain, however....... I ordered Panang curry chicken, massiman curry chicken and fresh roll shrimp, for take out, the bill was over $30. There was maybe 3-4 little pieces of chicken in each meal. Have been going there since they took over green mango.  They are using smaller containers to make portions look bigger and most of the container is curry sauce.  I had to find something else to eat being still hungry.  Very disappointing, I tried a couple times but no different, they are charging more and cutting back on the meats they put in."}
{"text":"I'm in love with this place. Not only is it a free-corkage BYOB joint, but the food is excellent. I had a ginger pork dish a generous helping of perfectly sticky rice to sop up the sauce. My only complaint would be that it wasn't as spicy as I was expecting -- I asked for a \"medium\" and got American Midwestern medium, not Thai medium.   There were also some pleasant food surprises, like the mini-samosas that were about the size and shape of a piece of Thai toast, and the delicious little dumplings (both of which came from the appetizer platter I shared with my wife).  My favorite part of the experience, though, was the service. We had one shy, kind of demure server who got us water and opened the wine we brought, but the server during the meal? Very cheeky and humorous, while also taking excellent care of us. I hope to get the same server again when I most definitely return.  I'd put this place head-to-head with any of the super-good Thai joints in Los Angeles, without a doubt.  (Also, the pumpkin custard dessert is freaking delicious. I couldn't finish it, but man! The flavor combination of pumpkin, sweet custard, and the coconut in the rice base was splendid.)"}
{"text":"After 2 attempts at take-out here, I'm over it. The food is flavorful, but they have screwed up both orders.   The first time, they only gave me half the order & I had to go back mid-snowstorm to get the rest. At least I got a $20 gift card for that. However, that is barely a meal with the prices here.   Second try, they attempted to walk off without making change for the bill and gave the wrong food. We ended up with a veg appetizer instead of meat - it's got totally different items in it - and a pork entree instead of chicken. Not to mention my noodles (not soup) are drowning in extra sauce.   Now we're eating pathetic samosas & tofu instead of delicious dumplings and satay. It's not worth driving back to fix it.   Get your act together, Thai Cottage. I'll stick with Curry Away."}
{"text":"This is a nice Thai restaurant in Regent Square.  I like Thai food spicy and they are glad to oblige.  Their soups are all good, but I'm partial to those with coconut milk.  The staff is friendly and efficient. The curries are all excellent, red, green, yellow and traditional Massaman are all tasty.  Chicken is thin cut and delicious in curries and soups.  Summertime is nice to eat hear because of the outdoor seating allowing for enjoying lunchtime sun and for people watching in the Square.  Many other places to stop near by.  I recommend the restaurant."}
{"text":"Cozy and inviting atmosphere with an attentive staff. The menu is vegetarian -friendly and hands down the best Thai food I've had in The Burgh."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my lunch,  I got the Teriyaki chicken even though I ate a little something off of all my friends plate. Everything was cooked perfectly and it looked amazing. By far the best Thai I have ever had..."}
{"text":"First time eating at the Thai Cottage. Extremely nice inside, but it was such a nice evening we ate outside. Aside from the loud S. Braddock traffic, sitting outside was very nice.   We had two Bubble teas that were one of the best I've had in the city. Spring rolls, which also were very delicious. For our dinner we had pad Thai and spicy tofu eggplant and rice. Both dinners were very good and will definitely eat here again.   Being that this is a Thai restaurant they will ask you what scale you want your food on the spicy scale. I like very spicy food, so I asked them to make it as hot as they can. Not sure if they didn't trust me or if my idea of spicy and their idea of spicy is different. My girlfriend who doesn't even like spicy (got her pad Thai at a spice level 0) tasted my sauce and said she too couldn't taste that it was spicy. I removed a star for this, but altogether it was a great experience and will be back."}
{"text":"Having newly moved from Buffalo, I was looking for a place to replace my favourite, Jasmine. I think this is going to be my new Thai place. I judge all Thai places by their Pad Thai and this is some of the best Pad Thai I've had. It was a perfect sized portion, full of meat, and just the right amount of spice. A lot of the Pad Thai meat is just greasy peices of meat, but at this place, even the meat had flavour!! My friend got a curry dish and he loved it as well, The waitresses were super sweet and attentive as well, an added bonus."}
{"text":"I ate here right before watching a movie at the movie theatre a block away. Had the basil fried rice. It was good, not spectacular. Our server was pretty attentive. A small detail, but I didn't like the layout or design of their menu. It was very hard to read with the font that they chose. Trying to introduce \"the cool\" factor in the design only detracted from the overall readability."}
{"text":"First I will say this is a review for a take out order, so I would have probably given this place a two and a half stars otherwise. I order their Tom Kha Noodle soup with beef with a level 8 out of 10 spiciness. The beef was pretty bland and had almost no heat. The soup part was slightly tastier, but still bland and not spicy at all. My girlfriend ordered the Thai style fried rice with chicken and she was not impressed with it...had to use soy sauce. The Thai iced tea was very good. Finally, the pumpkin custard with sweet sticky rice was ok. I'd give the Thai cottage another try, but it would have to be an eat in experience though it will be hard to do that with the Square Cafe down not too far down the block."}
{"text":"Had Kao Soy with shrimp. Medium spice with pickled greens on side because I wasn't sure. Ate it with pickled greens in the bowl. Friendly service. Good atmosphere. Delicious food. Wife had Shrimp Pad Thai and it was much less oily than others."}
{"text":"I had what I could only describe as a pleasant if innocuous  Thai meal here.It started well with what they call Cottage wings These were crispy chicken wings without a hint of oiliness They came with a wonderful sweet hot chili dipping sauce and I  devoured them.Then the main dish., pineapple curry with pork came and my enthusiasm flagged.The first thing I noticed were the peas  and carrots which had to have come from cans or frozen packs.Then the taste which reminded me of the old American Chinese dish sweet and sour and the memory was not a pleasant one.The pork itself was tasteless.There was no complexity to this dish as in real Thai cooking. I mean I'm not expecting  Pok Pok here but Pittsburgh has to do better than this. I'll keep looking for that more authentic Thai meal and if I find it I'll let you know.The service here was great but the food just OK."}
{"text":"Best Thai food in Pittsburgh!   The service is always friendly and quick. Quality is always consistent (perfect) and portions are very large. Favorite dishes: crab rangoon, spicy friend rice and kee mao. Absolutely perfect every time!  Oh, also the corking fee is incredibly reasonable at 50 cents (for recycling). This place can't be beat!!"}
{"text":"Best bubble tea I have experienced in pittsburgh. With milk and green tea options for a base along with a variety of flavors, they're sure to impress.   Pineapple fried rice and pad Thai are also very good. Check out the lunch specials--it's a good deal. Entree with soup/salad for $8.50. Large portions and great service. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"So delicious! My friend and I were looking for a Thai restaurant around Squirrel Hill today, and this happened to be the only one open at the time. Thank God that it was! The service was great, and the ambience of this place is so comfortable and cute. My friend ordered spring rolls and we both had the Pad Thai. The entrees came with a soup or salad. The lunch specials were around $8, which was not stated on the menu, but was a nice surprise at the end of the meal. Everything came out rather quickly and was wonderful. I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"This is our favorite Thai place in Pittsburgh. The food is great, and so is the service. Their tofu is extremely tasteful, and along with everything else we've ever had there! Also love the atmosphere in there!"}
{"text":"Absolutely phenomenal food ! Excellent service and very cozy. I loved the bubble tea and believe I got the spicy garlic chicken with rice . It was unbelievable ! While the rice other places is usually plain and dull, this rice was incredibly flavorful with spices that blew my mind ! & and the chicken and sauce !?! AMAZING . Portion sizes were also excellent . Overall excellent experience"}
{"text":"The fiancé and I went over here for a quick, late lunch on a Monday afternoon, and boy am I glad we did.  Every single dish we got was complex, delicious, and satisfying, at a good price.  Fiancé couldn't decide between the duck noodle soup and the Thai fried rice with chicken, so he got both - plus a green tea milk tea (which they obligingly brought out without boba), and I got the prik khing with chicken.  For three normal lunch portions, we got away under $30 before tip!   The place was more or less empty by the time we got there, and the hostess/waitress was very attentive and pleasant, without hovering at all.  The food was just wonderful.  Fantastic place - highly recommended - will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Best food we've had in Pittsburgh! We got the eggplant tofu and the beef noodles, and they were both stellar. And it showed up super quickly. Don't know why this place isn't mobbed with customers, considering it's on a cute street at a cute intersection in a nice part of town. Loved the sesame salad dressing too."}
{"text":"We come here often and love it. Cheerful servers, delicious food, and always accommodating. The curries, tom kha, choo chee, and see ew are my favorites, and they don't mind when I ask for extra eggplant or mushrooms in my dishes (they're so good!) The service Friday nights is particularly spectacular. I always leave happy!"}
{"text":"Such a gem in the middle of Regent Square! Great food with great taste! We had the Spring Rolls with peanut sauce, Taro bubble tea, Green Curry (spicy level 8), and Pad Thai (spicy level 2). Food had amazing flavors, prices were reasonable, and the service was quick and helpful. This place definitely ranks as one of the best Thai restaurants in the city!"}
{"text":"Vegetarians be careful: all of their curries have fish sauce,\"just a little bit\" to quote the waiting staff. We explicitly double checked that what we ordered should be fish sauce and oyster sauce and meat free. Fifteen minutes later we got our curry which has \"a little bit of fish sauce in the paste\". I gave them an extra star for the honesty but the food istelf is not great: the stir fry was one note with lots of salt and surprisingly lots of sugar."}
{"text":"Great Thai food on Regent Square - probably my favorite in the area. Great, authentic Pad Kee Mao, delicious curries. Cute little spot to eat, but I'm a huge fan of takeaway. Quick turnaround time and nice people. Definitely recommend from a Thai food lover."}
{"text":"I've eaten here several times since they've opened and the food has always been great. The regular server inside is super friendly and attentive. Their menu seems a bit more varied than some other Thai places in the area, which I like. It's more than just your 10 typical pad thai-ish dishes.  The Thai iced tea is really good, as are the bubble teas. I'm glad they have real bubble teas and not just bubble smoothies like Green Mango had.  I only wish they delivered!"}
{"text":"In this rare instance, the food was very good although it is not the best I've ever had. We ordered the Kee Mao, Pad Thai, and the fresh rolls with tofu. The portions were satisfying enough and the food was definitely enjoyable.   What really discouraged me from coming again was the service, which was abysmal and completely soured the experience. The waiter actually forgot we were waiting to be served. We waited 40 minutes for a Thai Iced tea before he realized. I would have understood if the place was packed but there were literally only 3 other tables there. People who sat down after us who had ordered the same thing and more were served before us and left.   Once we actually got our food which was a little over AN HOUR later. We quickly ate and paid our check to salvage the rest of our night.   So if you want to spend 2 hours at a restaurant staring at other people eat while you quietly starve then I would go here."}
{"text":"I live in Regent Square so I've had the chance to try this place a couple of times. I will admit, I was not impressed the first time (late 2015) because the portions were so small for the price... and not like \"I'm a mad American because I didn't have left overs\" but, We got multiple dishes and really felt ripped off. It was literally lunch portions at dinner prices. However, I returned last month and they've really changed the game. The food is great and the menu isn't too large. Definitely worth a visit. And of course, get an appetizer."}
{"text":"I am pleased to find another delicious Thai restaurant in Pittsburgh.  Thai Cottage is a quaint and intimate gem in the heart of Regent Square.  Fresh ingredients and robust in flavor; everything on the menu is delicious.  Normally I stick to my Tofu Pad Thai, but here I've ventured off and tried other amazing dishes.  Basil fried rice - where you can actually taste the basil, iand several curries to dance on your taste buds.  My current favorite is Pineapple Curry with Tofu.  I never though I would enjoy curry... I had a bad experience in college where someone ruined it for me.  However this dish allowed me to fall in love again.  The perfect combination of sweet and savory, this dish awakens my palate.  The best question: \"How hot do you want it? From 1 to 10.\"  Make mine a 7, or if I'm daring, 8.  Thai Cottage is BYOB so feel free to bring a tasty adult beverage if you so desire.  Or try their Thai Iced Tea for something different.    Next time you're craving Thai, head to Regent Square and dine at Thai Cottage.  You can thank me later."}
{"text":"Great chicken satay, and even better Panang curry. I've only gotten takeout so I cannot attest to how the in-restaurant dining experience is, but everything was ready in a hurry and the food was tasty."}
{"text":"The overall experience was pretty decent. The setting was very warm. The service was kind of funny. She sat us down, and gave us our menus. Literally two minutes later, \"Are you ready to order?\" And then two minutes later, same thing. Lol we said give us 5 minutes, it ended up being 20. But other than that, food was good and service was good."}
{"text":"Date night. Food was very good and authentic. Seemed a bit \"dated\" in the decor and, well, the place smelled like cats. Definitely cats. Lost two points because it was that disturbing. They did lots of take out so perhaps the locals know something. Not sure I would go back as the smell is still with me. Sorry."}
{"text":"Thai Cottage would seem like a better restaurant if a great Thai restaurant hadn't just vacated that space in Regent Square. We stopped in for lunch yesterday, and while the food was solid and the service was good, it's a step down from the Green Mango, at the same price.  My Thai beef and sticky rice salad (a special) was advertised as being served on spring mix greens, but came out over romaine instead. Since we were at lunch, the server offered a choice of soup or salad to go with the meal - sadly, the salad was simply average, just romaine and a tomato that was very out of season. The two bright spots were the steamed dumplings (delicious) and my husband's curry - sweet, as curries often are in Pittsburgh, but still well done.  The service was fine and very polite, but our server seemed to have a cold(!).  Would I go back? Sure, but I might stick with the standard menu rather than the specials - my guess is that the kitchen does its best work in its comfort zone. And with time, any missteps (like the wrong lettuce or a missing knife, or staff with the sniffles) might work themselves out. But I am keenly aware that great Thai food is the same distance from me in the other direction at the Green Mango location in Monroeville."}
{"text":"We love this place. Great Thai food, very fresh. Also, very convenient in Regent Square. Try samona and fresh rolls. Noodles are great too!"}
{"text":"We came out for a place a couple doors down but it was extremely busy so we looked around and found Thai Cottage.  Wow, what a pleasant surprise!  Nice atmosphere and just busy enough but not crowded. I had the mango curry and pad yum soup off of the lunch menu.  It was very good."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here for lunch today. A little over $8 for the lunch special including a salad or soup which I thought was a good value. I had the cashew chicken with a Thai Iced Tea and my boyfriend had the chicken curry. Everything was delicious. I love the decor on the inside, beautiful lanterns hanging from the ceiling and benches with decorative pillows. Such a cute little spot for lunch or takeout :)"}
{"text":"Found my new go-to Thai place!  Thai Cottage beats its peers because: (a) the staff is super nice, (b) the decor and ambiance is inviting - a little trendy, a little kid-friendly, a little comfortable, and (c) the food was well-priced, well-presented, and super tasty!"}
{"text":"Have been a regular customer for going on two years. Good solid Thai food. Always fresh and tasty! Also, I'm a vegetarian and recommend their pumpkin curry in a major way"}
{"text":"Ordered takeout one night about an hour before they closed. Stepped in and wished I had the time to dine in because the ambiance inside was so unexpectedly nice. Wooden tables and seats and an assortment of beautiful lanterns hanging from the ceiling provided dim lighting for a romantic setting. The bench along the wall on the right had pillows to cushion your back. Boyfriend and I ordered crab fried rice, pad see ew, and lychee green tea to go. There were a few tables for outdoor seating where we sat to wait for our food. When it was ready, a very smiley and sweet server came outside to bring us our food. It was only an 8-10 minute wait. I wanted to order the crab fried rice because the last time I had it at a Thai restaurant, it was fantastic. This one, however, wasn't nearly as good, but it was still a decent dish. The pad see ew was a little better. The lychee green tea was too sweet. I wasn't crazy about the food here, but would love to come back and eat in to enjoy the ambiance.

{"text":"I love this place so much! I don't know how best to describe how awesome the food is and how laid back the atmosphere is! My husband and I moved out to the area recently and we have been coming here almost weekly! The papaya salad is the best I have ever had! It's got a sweetness to it that's perfect! I love all the noodle dishes and the mango curry with beef is to die for! I love the decor and the staff are sweet and welcoming. I travel a lot for work and when I come home, this is the first place I go! It's BYOB so I like that i can bring my own favorite wines too!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite lunch spot in Regent Square. The lady who runs it is super-sweet and fun, and the food is of high quality (though to be honest, I haven't met a Thai restaurant in Pittsburgh that I didn't enjoy - except perhaps that place next to the Tobacco Outlet on Liberty Avenue in Bloomfield whose name I can't remember).   When I was in there yesterday, I was pleasantly surprised by how quickly our meals came out and how attentive the service was in general.   The calamari appetizer was especially tender and delightful (I'm used to calamari being a bit chewy and I generally like that - but this stuff was really just good and tender, reminded me of scallops.)  The decor is mellow and tasteful, in the summertime the restaurant feels like a nice shadowy-shady respite from the sun."}
{"text":"I had the choo chee here. I wanted green curry, but unfortunately they put fish sauce in their curries. The place was packed and the seating was cramped. The food wasn't bad... but it wasn't great. The ambiance wasn't bad... but it wasn't great. All told, Thai Cottage is solidly a three star kind of place."}
{"text":"The pad Thai made with bean noodles is the best pad Thai I've ever had.   Service was lovely, the atmosphere is so cozy and warm. Will definitely be back frequently."}
{"text":"Oh how I loved living in Regent Square. Thai Cottage is one of the reasons. We'd stop by or order take away several times a month.  The mango salad is really so good though I do order it without fish sauce. Pad Thai is always spot on and the appetizers are delicious. When changing ownership a few years back I was concerned that the quality would be compromised. Fortunately it wasn't; at all."}
{"text":"I love this place. Their pork dumplings are to die for. You also have to try the pineapple curry. I have only ordered takeout but they always have my order ready right on time and are very friendly. It's my guilty little pleasure since I live in the neighborhood.  Definitely worth checking out if not you're into authentic Thai food!"}
{"text":"We hadn't been here since last fall and were surprised with the renovations.    The woman greeted us enthusiastically as we entered and was very attentive throughout our meal ( a nice change from some of the Green Mango-era staff).  I like the new look-- more neutral colors, a collection of pierced-metal ceiling fixtures gathered in the center of the room, a different seating arrangement (benches along one wall with comfy pillows).  The  music was also enjoyable, Madeleine Peyroux and Diana Krall held my attention until our food arrived, then I could focus on nothing else.  :)  I ordered Pad Kee Mow, wide rice noodles with napa cabbage and Thai basil in a garlicy sauce; my husband enjoyed his chicken and vell peppers in a Thai basil sauce with rice.  Both dishes were absolutely delicious.    We live a 45 minute drive away, but will be making excuses to visit the area more often, just to eat here."}
{"text":"Awesome place! I can't wait to go back! Yesterday, July 3...After a long walk with the puppy at Frick Park, we were planning on going  back to Oakland for bubble tea, and passed this place with their sign posted on the sidewalk said \"milk tea\" ...WIN!   After I parked the vehicle, I looked them up on Yelp, saw their menu and pics of their food...WIN! I gave them a call to see if they had outdoor seating because we had the dog, and...WINNN! We took a seat at the table, the AWESOMEST, super nice, friendly waitress came out with menus and water for us AND the dog...WIN! The food on the menu sounded so good, we make our choices, ordered our bubble milk teas. The waitress kept the cups full and the puppy water bowl full...we didn't want for nothing!  The food was incredible, I ordered my son take out and my daughter tried the pumpkin custard sticky rice...WIN! Was SO good. My only mistake was not ordering me one. My sons dish was beyond amazing...I wish I could remember what it's called. It is a noodle bowl. That will be what I order next time. Not that my soup wasn't scrum-didly-yumptuous, because it was.  We live pretty far away, but as long as the weather is good and outdoor seating is available, we will always have an excuse to go there because we will take the dog to Frick park for outdoor walking fun and top it off with the Thai Cottage for real.  I think we are going to make Thai Cottage a long-term habit and summer tradition!"}
{"text":"Green Mango was a Regent Square institution, which left some big shoes to fill, but Thai Cottage fills the void and delivers all of the hits with quality to boot. Before you devour your favorite dish, peruse the appetizers. The obvious favs are the crispy spring rolls, chicken satay and samosas, but you can't go wrong with Cottage Combo I or II -- something for everybody! The curry options include seasonal variations, but ye olde standby order is usually the pineapple tofu, yellow, or massaman. The standard 1-10 \"how spicy?\" scale is nothing to be scared of, so go big or go home. If you got noodles on the brain, then the classic pad thai or see ew always hits the mark."}
{"text":"I like it. I can't speak to authenticity, since I've never been to thailand, but I can say the food is delicious, and will hit the spot with the usual suspects of things you can expect from an American Thai restaurant. And they have a few things on the menu you don't see everywhere else, and its all delicious. I dream about their pumpkin curry!"}
{"text":"Better than Noodlehead (and I love Noodlehead).   Tons of options. I had the hot-and-sour noodle bowl (Tom Yum Bowl) with shrimp. The shrimp were large and fresh, which was new for me and Thai food in Pittsburgh. I tried my friend's fried rice which was on point too. Everything was delicious. Oh, the Thai custard with sticky rice was really really excellent for desert. So different but so good.   Our server, Bell, was hilarious and very professional."}
{"text":"I love this place ! I highly recommend the Pad Thai and the Kao Soy. I also have tried the shrimp fried rice and the cashew chicken and those are good too! The staff has always been very friendly to me and the decor is very nice as well."}
