{"text":"I really like this place. I get the orange chicken or the pan fried noodles, both are delicious.  Give it a try."}
{"text":"After the closing of both Noodle and Rice and Silver Dragon, we were in a tremendous need for excellent Asian (Chinese) food. Our prayers were answered when the longtime chef from the original Bamboo House and his lovely wife Jenny opened China Chef Bistro in the old Noodle and Rice location. I've been in at least once a week, have brought serious Chinese food people with me and everyone absolutely loved it. Very inexpensive and extensive lunch menu, the correct mustard, fantastic service! Reminds me of Hong Kong style, back home. I've never steered anyone wrong with an inaccurate review and I'm not about to start now!"}
{"text":"Disclaimer: I'm pretty easy to please. $30 for possibly the worst lemon chicken I've ever had (tasteless) and house special soup with an oddly sweet tomato broth. The sesame chicken was passable due to decent sauce. Husband had a soft drink. Maybe the noodle dishes are better. Chicken appears to be cooked from frozen. Friendly service though."}
{"text":"A wonderful family owned resturant. The delicious and fresh recipes were exceptional. Last week we ordered the hot and sour soup and was the best we have ever had anywhere. Tonight was another stunning meal. The potstickers, Scechuan beef, and the house specialty chow mein with noodles were expertly prepared with pride and care. The vegetables snapped with freshness and not over cooked like at most places. The owners are very friendly and gave us a warm and sincere greeting. Looking forward to going back and trying more menu items. Look no further if you want a delicious Chinese meal."}
{"text":"I have been looking for almost two years for a great Chinese place that is fresh and taste like Chinese food back in Chicago. Hands done this place is by far the best I have eaten out here in two years!!! B"}
{"text":"Egg rolls taste frozen, the inside is like blended mush then deep fried, the sweet and sour chicken were deep fried nuggets of hard ?, couldn't tell it was chicken. The fried rice and cashew chicken were very bland!!! Was hoping for better as we live close by... oh well... next"}
{"text":"I really want to like China Chef Bistro, it is neat and clean, cutely decorated, the help is friendly and the food is well prepared. It's just very plain, so I will come back and try a spicier dish. The lunch specials are 5.99 and 6.50, but the portions are small to match. Perhaps a couple of entrees and some leftovers would be a better approach if you have a big appetite. I ordered the shrimp with vegetables, minus the zucchini., Dining companion had the chicken with snow peas and was very pleased. The lunch entree comes with a crab puff and small vegetable egg roll, both of which were average, and since I don't eat gluten or fried food, are a waste on me. The hot and sour soup was very mild in both the hot and sour departments, and it did contain pork so, be careful if you are vegetarian. The egg drop soup was a good traditional preparation.  I look forward to trying more of the menu!"}
{"text":"We had a great experience when we ordered from China Chef Bistro the other evening. We ordered 3 entrees and 2 appetizers. It was ready early and they gave us a call to let us know. Picking up was easy, and staff was very friendly. The food was just as ordered and tasted great! We will be back!"}
