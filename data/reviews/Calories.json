{"text":"Great decor. Woody and warm. Dependable desserts, but nothing spectacular - except the lemon tart. On the pricy side."}
{"text":"I guess the place is under new ownership and goes by Calories Cafe now but they still have lovely cakes and tasty drinks.  They seem to have some food as well. Cafe faire, like sandwiches, quiche, soup and salads. I didn't try them but they look good. They also have little pastries in addition to big cakes.  I had a slice of the tiramisu cake and a hot chocolate. My hot chocolate was really nice. No whipped cream, which might be a bummer for some, but I liked not having it. It has a nice flavour, not too sweet. It's well mixed, no syrupy stuff at the bottom of my cup (I HATE when that happens).   The cake is very moist. Good sized slice. It isn't overly sweet or filled with too much icing. Really a nice ratio. I don't have any complaints at all.  There is decent seating, outlets and free wifi.  It is a really nice change from the usual starbucks/java U/second cup that can be found in the area. It has a more relaxed and homier feel than those cafes. I also like that the lighting isn't glaringly bright. It really makes the space feel warmer; more relaxing.   They have a good selection of bottled drinks, including Kombucha, Stewart's soda, various flavours of San Pellegrino, and those fruit juices with bits of aloe inside.   This is a really ideal place for someone looking to study/hang out/have some tasty cakes and not feel like you need to rush out immediately afterwards. The staff is friendly and inviting as well. This is the kind of experience that turns a curious person (me) into a regular customer."}
{"text":"On m'avait fortement suggeré d'aller dans ce café... Pour une première visite, j'ai bien apprécié. Service courtois, la dame au comptoir vient te voir dès ton arrivé, te suggère les desserts qui ont la cote auprès des clients, belle présentation et beaucoup de choix. Ils offrent aussi des wraps, sandwichs, salade de pâtes, soupe du jour (qui était excellente!), quelques choix de café, chai latte et chocolat chaud.   L'ambiance est décontractée et cosy, bonne musique d'ambiance, lumière tamisée en soirée. Clientèle variée allant d'étudiant à petite famille."}
